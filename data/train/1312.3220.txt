    "according to hamilton s principle physical motions of a system evolving in a lapse of time @xmath0 are characterized as those histories @xmath1 which are extrema of the action @xmath2 when the value of configuration variable is fixed at @xmath3 to be @xmath4 .",
    "whenever it is appropriate , it is natural to parametrize solutions by boundary data .",
    "additionally , if the interval of interest is formed by gluing adjacent subintervals @xmath5 \\cup ... \\cup [ a_{n-1 } , a_n = b]$ ] , a solution would be composed of pieces corresponding to each subinterval .",
    "a solution in @xmath6 would have to be a solution in each of the subintervals , and the extra requirements to be an extremum could be interpreted as conditions matching the left and right derivatives at each gluing point .",
    "the solution in @xmath6 might be parametrized using @xmath4 , or it could be parametrized by the boundary data of the first subinterval @xmath7 .",
    "this can be considered as a sort of initial data characterizing the solution in the whole @xmath6 .",
    "since we are talking about solving the equations of motion without any error , we know that evolution preserves all the structure given by the machinery of symplectic geometry : in particular , evolution @xmath8 is a symplectic map and symmetries have corresponding conserved quantities .",
    "if the appropriate map @xmath9 were found , initial conditions would be parametrized by @xmath10 and the space would have the two form @xmath11 which in some domain would be non degenerate providing all the elements of a symplectic structure .",
    "if we had access to hamilton s principal function @xmath12 , defined to be the evaluation of the action in the solution determined by @xmath13 , then the desired map would be given by @xmath14 after doing the same for the final data ( with the aid of the map @xmath15 ) we would have devised a way to see evolution in an alternative picture @xmath16 which would enjoy of a symplectic structure .",
    "here one may complain that we seem to have introduced two different structural two forms @xmath17 and @xmath18 to each space @xmath19 , but closer analysis ( using @xmath20 ) shows us that they agree up to a sign .",
    "now , in this picture we can take on the job of investigating the pasting of evolution maps @xmath21 , @xmath22 to build an evolution for a longer period @xmath23 .",
    "since the equations of motion have been solved in each open interval , the remaining job is just to paste the final condition of @xmath21 with the initial condition of @xmath22 .",
    "proper pasting can be done if we bring this data to @xmath24 and match it there .",
    "this was our preamble to the main part of this section in which we present a version of veselov s discrete mechanics @xcite .",
    "the preamble provides a possible interpretation of the framework .",
    "we warn the reader that this interpretation looses part of its strength for the version of the formalism of sections [ discretescalargbft ] and [ gauge ] dealing with spacetimes of dimension greater than one because hamilton s principal function becomes inaccessible when the data at our disposal is the field s value at a discrete set of points .",
    "the best that we can do , even in principle , is to postulate a function that approximates hamilton s principal function from our partial knowledge of the boundary data ; for the continuation of this discussion see section [ reg - coar - cont ] .",
    "the preamble also highlights the pasting of subintervals as playing a primary role .",
    "our framework is motivated by the goal of having a formalism with simple gluing ; the difference between our version of the framework and veselov s is that when the system is of the form @xmath25 ( that is , free theory plus interaction ) our pasting conditions are independent of the interaction .",
    "time has been subdivided into a sequence of cells , lapses of time .",
    "we picture the time interval of our interest , @xmath0 , as a compact interval divided into a finite collection of closed subintervals that we will call _ time - atoms_. a generic time - atom in @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath26 , and if it is needed we number such time - atoms @xmath27 .",
    "our discretization is based on decimating each time - atom keeping track only of its past boundary @xmath28 , of its future boundary @xmath29 and of a center point @xmath30 representing `` the bulk of @xmath31 . ''",
    "the boundary points of interior time - atoms are shared @xmath32 , and @xmath6 s boundary is composed of @xmath33 ; we write the oriented boundary as @xmath34 .",
    "the system consists of a particle moving in a configuration space @xmath35 , while our decimated description records its position only in discrete time steps .",
    "our record of a history is : @xmath36    we are interested in describing histories locally . in the continuum a history is a curve @xmath37 ; keeping track of time , position and velocity @xmath38 gives us the correct arena to study mechanics in the 1st order formalism . at the discrete level",
    "our 1st order data will be the portion of a history at a time - atom @xmath39 this data gives us the position @xmath40 at the given time @xmath41 , and allows us to estimate the velocity in two independent ways : using @xmath42 or using @xmath43 .",
    "we recall that the map @xmath44 comes from a history , which implies that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are not independent : they need to obey @xmath47 .",
    "following veselov @xcite , the cornerstone of our version of discrete mechanics is a variational principle and we study the resulting geometrical structures .",
    "we start with the action @xmath48 with a discrete lagrangian of the form @xmath49 . according to the opening paragraph of this section ,",
    "the terms in the lagrangian are interpreted as approximations to hamilton s principal function in the past and future corners of @xmath31 respectively .",
    "hamilton s principle determines the motions predicted by our model as the extrema of the action while the end points are kept fixed .",
    "we will therefore calculate the effect on the action of a variation @xmath50 of the history @xmath51 .",
    "our notation in the local 1st order format is that @xmath52 is a variation of @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "note that the relation @xmath47 implies @xmath53= dq^-[\\tilde{v}(\\nu+1)]$ ] .",
    "the variation of the action @xmath54 $ ] is a sum of terms over the atoms , but it can be decomposed in a finer manner .",
    "this will allow us to separate contributions to the variation into bulk terms and boundary terms : @xmath55 & = &   \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial q^- } ( \\tilde{q}(1 ) ) dq^-[\\tilde{v}(1 ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\nu \\in u_{\\tiny\\mbox{disc } } } \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial q } ( \\tilde{q}(\\nu ) ) dq[\\tilde{v}(\\nu ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\nu , \\nu+1 \\in u_{\\tiny\\mbox{disc } } }   \\left ( \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial q^+ } ( \\tilde{q}(\\nu ) )   +   \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial q^- } ( \\tilde{q}(\\nu+1 ) )   \\right ) dq^+[\\tilde{v}(\\nu ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + &   \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial q^+ } ( \\tilde{q}(n ) ) dq^-[\\tilde{v}(n ) ] \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the bulk terms we read two types of equations of motion :    1 .",
    "@xmath56 , equations ensuring that we have a solution in the interior of each time - atom @xmath31 and which do not depend on variables of any other interval .",
    "@xmath57 , conditions requiring that the final conditions of @xmath31 match with the initial conditions of @xmath58 for the time - atoms that are pasted in the interior of @xmath6 .",
    "we will briefly recall a geometric picture that is standard in mechanics with continuum time before we write its analog in the discrete time framework . a history in the continuum @xmath59 in the first order formalism",
    "is seen as the following section @xmath60 . in this larger space , which displays velocities as independent , the dynamics of the system",
    "is encoded the expression for the variation of the action @xmath61 , written as @xmath62 =   -\\int_{u } \\tilde{q}^{{\\scalebox{0.7}{\\mbox{c}}}\\ast}(\\delta \\tilde{q } \\lrcorner \\hat{\\omega}_{\\cal l}^{\\scalebox{0.7}{\\mbox{c } } } ) +   \\int_{\\partial u } \\tilde{q}^{{\\scalebox{0.7}{\\mbox{c}}}\\ast } ( \\delta \\tilde{q } \\lrcorner \\theta_{\\cal l}^{\\scalebox{0.7}{\\mbox{c}}})$ ] , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are defined from this formula and enjoy rich properties ; see chapter 9 of @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath65 is the vector field , induced by the variation of the history , that lives in the space where the first order formalism takes place .",
    "we remark that in classical mechanics the variation of the action encodes all the information regarding the dynamics , which in this notation is organized as follows : cartan s form @xmath64 encodes the geometrical structure that arises when the equations of motion , coded in @xmath63 , vanish .",
    "a notational warning is in order : the most prominent element of the geometrical structure mentioned above is the symplectic @xmath66-form arising from evaluating @xmath67 at a component of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , our notation includes @xmath63 and @xmath68 .",
    "they carry a similar symbol because in a related formulation of mechanics and classical field theory they are two parts of the same object .",
    "the bundle structure , induces a grading of differential forms considering separately their vertical and horizontal parts @xcite .",
    "below we will discretize the horizontal parts and not the vertical parts making @xmath69 and @xmath70 objects that are related by the formalism , but which are different .",
    "this digression had the sole purpose of explaining the origin of the notation , and it will not play an essential role in the rest of the article .",
    "now we develop the discrete analog of this geometrical framework .",
    "our discrete setting suggests keeping the geometrical meaning but instead of integrating differential forms in a domain of spacetime ( and its boundary ) acting with cochains on the domain ( and its boundary ) seen as a chain composed of elementary cells that we call atoms . in this way",
    ", the sum over the discrete set @xmath71 will be written with a notation similar to that of an integral , indicating the action of the cochain on the domain .",
    "we will write equation ( [ ds ] ) in the form @xmath72 = - \\!\\ ! \\sum_{u-\\partial u } \\tilde{q}^\\ast(\\tilde{v } \\lrcorner \\hat{\\omega}_l )   + \\sum_{\\partial u } \\tilde{q}^\\ast(\\tilde{v } \\lrcorner \\theta_l ) \\quad .\\ ] ] let us explain the notation in detail .",
    "starting with the second term , @xmath3 is the @xmath73-chain @xmath74 in @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is a @xmath73-cochain , making @xmath77 .",
    "we will define the discrete cartan form @xmath78 below .",
    "let us explain the first term now : since the second term contains the contributions to @xmath79 from the boundary degrees of freedom ( @xmath80 ) , the first term should have all the other terms .",
    "this is the meaning of @xmath81 ; it includes contributions from variations on degrees of freedom @xmath45 for all @xmath82 except for the boundary degrees of freedom .",
    "generic atoms @xmath31 are seen as @xmath83-chains , and @xmath84 is a @xmath83-cochain .",
    "we will define @xmath85 below .",
    "when @xmath78 and @xmath86 are fed a chain they become @xmath83-forms acting on variations in the first order format . from ( [ ds ] ) we can read that @xmath87 @xmath88 where the differential @xmath83-forms displayed in the right hand sides have base point @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath90 is seen as having a term corresponding to the bulk of @xmath31 and two terms corresponding to @xmath91 .",
    "we caution the reader about a possible confusion generated by our notation : the intervals @xmath31 and @xmath92 share a point , and we use the convention @xmath93 . the @xmath83-forms @xmath94 and @xmath95 , however ,",
    "differ in more than a sign .",
    "we also define @xmath96 ; when this object is evaluated on a @xmath73-chain it becomes a @xmath66-form acting on variations of a history in the first order format @xmath97 below we will see that in important circumstances the induced @xmath66-forms are symplectic . since @xmath86 induces symplectic forms it is called multisymplectic .",
    "if the lagrangian in the continuum is of the form of a free theory plus an interaction term @xmath98 , the structure of our discretization by decimation with a `` bulk '' representative point and two estimates of velocity for each time - atom suggests seeking for a discrete lagrangian of the form @xmath99 with @xmath100 this feature has two related consequences .",
    "the first one is that the equations of motion of type ( ii ) would be those of the free theory .",
    "we say that our model leads to simple gluing of time - atoms .",
    "the second consequence is that the structural forms @xmath78 and @xmath86 defined above are independent of the interaction term .",
    "the objects just defined acquire useful properties when only solutions and first variations ( variations of the solution that are tangential to the space of solutions inside the space of histories ) are considered . in the space of solutions",
    "the variation of the action has only boundary contributions ; the bulk plays the important role of making the boundary data correlated , but it drops out of the expressions @xmath72 = \\sum_{\\partial u } \\tilde{q}^\\ast   ( \\tilde{v } \\lrcorner \\theta_l)= - \\theta_l(\\tilde{v}(1 ) , \\tilde{q}(1)^- ) + \\theta_l(\\tilde{v}(n ) , \\tilde{q}(n)^+ ) .\\ ] ]    consider any solution of the equations of motion @xmath51 and any two first variations @xmath101 of it ; the identity @xmath102 implies that @xmath103 this conservation law for the mutisymplectic form is called the multisymplectic formula . in the examples we will see that solutions induce a discrete flow ; this conservation law implies that the flow preserves the symplectic form induced by @xmath86 .",
    "now consider a situation in which a lie group @xmath104 acts on @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath104 also has an action on histories , and an action on the bundle used to describe local first order histories @xmath105 by @xmath106 .",
    "we consider the case in which this group action leaves the discrete lagrangian invariant : @xmath107 for all @xmath26 , for any first order history @xmath44 and for any @xmath108 .",
    "thus , @xmath109 is also invariant and the group action preserves the subspace of extrema .",
    "this fact , the subspace of extrema containing directions in which @xmath79 vanishes leads to conserved quantities .",
    "below we state this discrete analog of noether s theorem .",
    "we can use @xmath104 s action on the space of 1st order histories to transform @xmath110 into a vector field corresponding to a first variation @xmath111 . then , for any solution @xmath51 we have @xmath112 =   \\tilde{q}^\\ast \\left ( \\tilde{v}_\\xi \\lrcorner \\theta_l \\right )    @xmath113 and @xmath114 ; the equation written above with @xmath115 says that in the space of solutions we can write @xmath116 obtaining a single quantity that can be associated with the solution at @xmath31 .",
    "once we have stablished this , we can look again to equation ( [ noether1d ] ) as stating that @xmath117 , @xmath118 is independent of @xmath31 ; it is a conserved quantity associated with the symmetry generator @xmath119 .    in the examples we will see that the conservation law for @xmath86 implies that there is an induced symplectic form that is conserved , and we will apply our discrete version of noether s theorem .      here",
    "we mention structures that will be introduced in the examples given in this subsection , and that will be treated at length when we study field theories on discrete spacetimes .",
    "the example of _ a particle on a potential _ may be seen as a preamble to our treatment of spacetime scalar degrees of freedom , and the example of _ rigid body motion _ may serve as a preamble to our treatment of gauge fields .",
    "the reader may choose to go directly to the field theory sections .",
    "reduction by solving the gluing equations _ + we may be interested in solving the gluing equations to eliminate boundary variables . this reduction can be done explicitly because the gluing equations are simple .",
    "the resulting reduced formalism is described by an action principle with reduced lagrangian defined as the the value of the non - reduced lagrangian on histories that solve the gluing equations .",
    "note that , in several cases of interest , the gluing equations admit multiple solutions . see section [ reduced ] and the examples of this section for a detailed discussion .",
    "0.3 cm _ a formalism in terms of atomic boundary data _ + another attractive objective is to solve the interior equations of motion to eliminate the `` atomic bulk variables '' and have a formalism where the only data sits on the boundaries between neighboring time - atoms ( subintervals ) , and the only equations of motion are gluing equations . in general , this reduction leads to a complicated reduced lagrangian .",
    "thus , the resulting gluing equations are complicated as are the expressions for the structural forms giving conservation laws .",
    "the obvious alternative is to propose an effective lagrangian in terms of discrete histories resulting from a decimation only at the boundaries of the time - atoms .",
    "the resulting formalism falls within the framework of veselov s discrete time mechanics @xcite .",
    "the field theory analog of this boundary data formalism is discussed in section [ bdarydataf ] .",
    "0.3 cm _ covariant hamiltonian picture _ + a hamiltonian picture would have the advantage of being defined on a collection of cotangent bundles with canonical symplectic structures .",
    "veselov s discrete mechanics starts with a lagrangian variational principle and develops an equivalent hamiltonian picture @xcite .",
    "we introduce the basic notions of a covariant hamiltonian picture for field theories on discrete spacetimes in section [ canonical ] .    0.3 cm _ example 1 . particle moving on euclidian space with a potential _ + in our first example the discrete lagrangian is @xmath120 with @xmath121a$ ] and @xmath122a$ ] , where the points @xmath123 are equally spaced and the lapse between them has been denoted by `` @xmath124 . ''",

    "we call them simple gluing equations .",
    "consider any solution @xmath51 of the equations of motion , as we saw @xmath54 = -\\theta_l(\\tilde{v}(1 ) , \\tilde{q}(1)^- ) + \\theta_l(\\tilde{v}(n ) , \\tilde{q}(n)^+)$ ] with @xmath131 @xmath132 now we will see a concrete example of the conservation law ( [ multisymp1d ] ) for @xmath133 . for any pair of first variations @xmath101 of the solution @xmath51 @xmath134 an equation of this type also holds for any `` subsolution '' @xmath135}$ ] , which means that for every solution @xmath51 and at each time time - atom @xmath31 we have a two form @xmath136 .",
    "moreover , this two form is closed and non degenerate , which makes it a symplectic form .",
    "if at each time - atom we parametrize solutions by the initial data , ( [ multisymp1d ] ) may be written as the conservation of the symplectic form @xmath137    notice that this structural equation does not involve the potential @xmath138 .",
    "the potential determines the set of solutions and the relation between initial data and solutions , but the form of the equation expressing the conservation of the symplectic form is independent of the potential _it would be the same for a free particle_.    now consider the case of a free particle , @xmath139 . in this case",
    "the action is invariant under uniform translations .",
    "a first variation of this type in the first order format is of the form @xmath140 for every @xmath125 . according to our version of noether s theorem ( [ noether1d ] ) , for any solution @xmath51 and any @xmath141 we have @xmath142= -\\theta_l(\\tilde{v}(1 ) ,",
    "\\tilde{q}(1)^- ) + \\theta_l(\\tilde{v}(n ) , \\tilde{q}(n)^+)$ ] .",
    "this is the conservation of linear momentum in this discrete time setting , and it implies that @xmath143    before moving to another example , we comment on the relation between our version of discrete time mechanics and other versions of veselov s discrete time mechanics ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "our discretization of the time axis has two types of points : those labeled by @xmath41 for some @xmath31 and those in the middle of @xmath41 and @xmath144 .",
    "all other versions of discrete time mechanics use a simple discretization of time with all the events being of the same type .",
    "below we will `` erase ''",
    "half of the points in our discretization by solving the equations of motion associated with them .",
    "this is the @xmath83-dimensional case of the reduced formalism described in section [ reduced ] .",
    "recall that in our discrete lagrangian , the potential @xmath138 is independent of @xmath145 for @xmath146 . because of this , the equations of motion associated with those degrees of freedom are very simple : the gluing equations @xmath130 .",
    "we will solve this equations to obtain a reduced model with fewer variables .",
    "the boundary variables will be eliminated and the remaining variables will be the @xmath147s , the ones that represent the position at the `` bulk '' of the time - atoms . in order to write the reduced model",
    "properly we consider regions of a new type ; regions @xmath148 whose boundary is located where the remaining degrees of freedom sit , @xmath149 with @xmath150 . consider a history @xmath51 that is a solution of the gluing equations of motion in a region @xmath151 of the described type .",
    "now let us evaluate the action on a history @xmath51 which solves the gluing equations of motion restricted to @xmath148 .",
    "this portion of the history is parametrized by the remaining variables and will be written as @xmath152 .",
    "we obtain a reduced model with action @xmath153 this action is much closer to the one used in other approaches .",
    "the equations of motion resulting from @xmath154 are exactly those equations of motion of @xmath109 that we have not solved .",
    "thus , an extremum @xmath51 of @xmath109 yields an extremum of @xmath154 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath155 is an extremum of @xmath154 we can generate from it an extremum @xmath51 of @xmath109 restricted to a region @xmath156 of the allowed type .",

    "this reduced model also comes with a geometric structure that can be derived from the variation of the action .",
    "a key difference is that the formula for the conservation of the symplectic structure involves the potential explicitly .    it would also be interesting to study a possible formalism that used only boundary variables @xmath161 for each atom @xmath31 . in general cases ,",
    "building this formalism as a reduction of our original model leads to complicated lagrangians , but we can also define a new regularization with this , simpler , time discretization . a reasonable regularization is @xmath162 .",
    "the comparison between the formalisms derived from @xmath109 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 may be summarized in the following list :    1 .",
    "the models defined by @xmath109 and @xmath163 are equivalent in the sense that their solutions are in one - to - one correspondence .",
    "the models of @xmath109 and @xmath163 are of similar complexity in the sense that the operation needed to find solutions of one from solutions to the other is trivial .",
    "the model defined by @xmath164 is not equivalent to the other formalism , but in the continuum limit they should all agree .",
    "4 .   the model of @xmath164",
    "has the interpretation of being an approximation to the model obtained by reducing by solving the bulk variables ; only the solution in the interior of each @xmath31 has been replaced by free motion . the reduced model by solving the interior equations of motion would be equivalent to the models of @xmath109 and @xmath163 .",
    "5 .   the model of @xmath164seems to be of similar complexity to that of @xmath163 . 6 .",
    "the geometric structure in the space of histories leading to a conserved symplectic structure and noether s theorem is essentially simpler in the model of @xmath109 , since it is independent of any potential .",
    "0.3 cm _ example 2 .",
    "discrete time models for rigid body motion _ + our second example models a rigid body in @xmath165-dimensional euclidian space moving freely and described from the center of mass frame .",
    "this example will serve as a preamble to our treatment of gauge fields in subsections [ gauge ] and [ bf+subsection ] .",
    "the variables used to describe histories include @xmath166 group elements giving decimated information about the angular position of the body .",
    "euclidean reference frames are fixed in the body and in the laboratory : the are called the `` body frame '' and the `` space frame . '' after an auxiliary euclidian isometry between the two frames is set , the angular position of the body with respect to space is prescribed by moving the auxiliary isometry with a @xmath166 group element .    the variable @xmath147 gives a map from the body frame to the space frame telling us the angular position of the body with respect to space at time @xmath41 ; similarly , @xmath167 gives information about the angular position of the body with respect to space at time @xmath168 , and @xmath169 stores similar information corresponding to time @xmath170 .    the angular displacement from time @xmath41 to time @xmath168 according to the body frame is @xmath171 ; this object lets us estimate the angular velocity in the body frame in the time - atom @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "notice that if the auxiliary space frame had been chosen differently and had another orientation , the same history would be described by left - translated variables @xmath173 , etc ( for some @xmath174 ) ; however , the angular displacement in the body frame would not be affected by such time independent left - translations",
    ". we will also use variables in the lie algebra that are related to angular momentum ; the exact relation to angular momentum will be given below after we derive it using our formalism .",
    "as we did before we will divide time atoms in two segments ; in this example we will use the notation @xmath175 , and the lie algebra variables will be denoted by @xmath176 .",
    "we remark that these variables are in the body frame ; unfortunately , we use lower case letters ( as opposed to the convention of using capital letters for body frame objects @xcite ) because the notation is compromised by the goal of writing this model in a way that shows its similarities with the models of modified bf theories presented in subsection [ bf+subsection ] . notice",
    "that since our @xmath177 `` @xmath178 '' variables are associated to the body frame , they do not change under rotations of the fiducial space frame .    in the first order format a history is described by @xmath179 where the first three entries belong to @xmath166 and the last two to @xmath177 .",

    ".    the action under study may be invariant under more involved transformations , transformations that may involve several neighboring spacetime atoms or completely nonlocal transformations .",
    "as long as the transformations preserve the action , they also preserve the subspace of extrema , and the ideas used in the previous study apply to them . using our geometric tools one would find explicit expressions for conserved quantities and/or local constraints , depending on the specific case .",
    "we may be especially interested in a model for a field theory on a discrete spacetime in which solutions are composed by gluing histories over spacetime atoms that are not divided into corners .",
    "neighboring atoms would share boundary data , and the gluing conditions would be the only field equations .    the first option",
    "to try is to define a reduced system solving the internal field equations at each @xmath31 . the reduced lagrangian is @xmath429 for @xmath291 an extremum of @xmath351 for fixed boundary conditions @xmath430 .",
    "the reduced system has field equations determined by @xmath431 , and the new version of cartan s form @xmath432 is induced : @xmath433 there is then a multisymplectic form @xmath434 that participates in the appropriate multisymplectic formula .",
    "furthermore , solving the gluing field equations is equivalent to solving the implicit equations defined by the coupled covariant local generating functions @xmath431 corresponding to the neighboring atoms .",
    "a geometrical interpretation of this `` evolution by canonical moves '' in terms of hamilton s principal function is sketched in the opening paragraphs of section [ 1d ] .",
    "we remark that here this picture is merely motivational because in effective theories for nontrivial field theories on spacetimes of dimension higher than @xmath83 we do not have access to hamilton s function . for an extended discussion see section [ reg - coar - cont ] .",
    "clearly the functional form of @xmath431 is in general complicated since it requires solving nontrivial field equations of the nonreduced system . in the following subsection",
    "we describe a different reduction which leads to a simple lagrangian .    a second option to try",
    "is defining a simple effective theory directly on a discretization in which the only data stored for a given spacetime atom @xmath31 is the data over @xmath91 .",
    "notice that a discrete field theory of this type is not defined on an ordinary lattice .",
    "for example , in the case of scalar fields the lattice sites where degrees of freedom sit are the points of type @xmath286 that are shared by @xmath66 atoms independently of the dimension ; in contrast , for an ordinary cubical lattice each site has @xmath435 neighbors .",
    "we tried to emphasize that our formalism had two types of field equations : ( i ) equations in the interior of the atoms and ( ii ) simple gluing equations .",
    "since the gluing equations are simple , we can solve them explicitly and end up with a formalism with fewer variables , the `` bulk variables , '' and a reduced lagrangian that is not too complicated .",
    "histories in this reduced formalism , @xmath436 in the case of the scalar field , are histories in an ordinary lattice discretization of spacetime where all the sites are of the same type .",
    "the values of the rest of the variables of our non - reduced model will be inferred by explicitly solving the gluing equations @xmath437 .",
    "nontrivial field equations are determined by the reduced action @xmath438 that is defined on a slightly contracted domain @xmath439 which has points of the type @xmath41 in its boundary .",
    "the reduced action can be written in terms of a reduced lagrangian @xmath440 , where the sum is over cells dual to vertices of our triangulation .",
    "the field restricted to a dual cell @xmath441 , @xmath442 , is the argument of the reduced lagrangian .",
    "if the original lagrangian was written as a sum of corner lagrangians @xmath443 , the reduced lagrangian is also a sum of corner lagrangians @xmath444 .",
    "we show explicitly how this reduction is done for scalar fields in subsection [ nlwaves ] .",
    "if solutions of the gluing equations are not unique we may still define @xmath445 as the minimum value reached by @xmath351 for the given boundary conditions . in our experience with systems in @xmath83-dimensional spacetimes , we saw that for a particle moving in euclidian space under a potential the gluing equation has a unique solution , while for the rigid body in discrete time , the solution to the gluing equation is not unique . when solutions of the gluing equation are not unique , one should verify that the definition of @xmath445 is physically appropriate .",
    "for example , the sign in the original action for veselov s model of rigid body motion had to be modified for this definition to work .",
    "we will also find gluing equations with double solutions and explicitly define the reduced model in the lattice gauge theory example presented in subsection [ lgt ] .",
    "clearly this issue is delicate in general situations , but the simplicity of the gluing equations should make a meaningful analysis possible in most cases . the issues to investigate are if in the case of multiple solutions there are some that can be categorized as physical and some as discretization artifacts , and if the reduced lagrangian @xmath445 is well defined .",
    "once the action is written we can proceed to investigate the geometrical structures that follow from the variational problem .",
    "the reduced system takes place in a discretization in which for each dual cell , the `` boundary degrees of freedom '' are not shared by only two cells .",
    "this complicates the organization of degrees of freedom to define the structural forms ; in order to achieve this task one would have to follow conventions of the type given by marsden et al .",
    "the multisymplectic framework for field theory allows for a useful separation into kinematical structure and dynamics .",
    "this separation does not happen in the lagrangian picture on the jet bundle @xmath446 that we have been using ; the separation occurs in the hamiltonian picture on the dual jet bundle @xmath447 . in that space there are canonical forms @xmath448 , @xmath449 .",
    "we will not attempt to produce a new map that let us pull back those canonical forms from the continuum to our discrete setting .",

    "the structural form @xmath78 , providing a momentum map and a version of noether s theorem , is exceptionally simple ; all the complications inherent to general relativity are deposited in finding solutions to the `` bulk field equations , '' while gluing is kept simple as simple as in a model for bf theory . the explicit expression for the multisymplectic form @xmath674 , \\tilde{\\ae}(\\tau_\\nu))$ ]",

    ". in this model",
    ", we can solve the gluing equations as conditions on the variables @xmath359 , obtaining a system whose histories are described by the same variables as reisenberger s model except that it uses one single variable @xmath666 per co - dimension two simplex @xmath282 instead of one variable per wedge @xmath677 . for most reduced histories",
    "one would be able to undo the reduction and find one history of reisenberger s model corresponding to he original reduced history .",
    "one could try to reduce it further and eliminate the @xmath678 variables as we did in the lattice gauge theory model ; however , there is no simple expression of the reduced action in which the @xmath678 variables drop out .",
    "an alternative reduction would start with the original model and solve the interior field equations of an atom @xmath31 to eliminate as much as possible of the @xmath679 variables , the @xmath356 variable and the @xmath680 variables .",
    "a further alternative defines a simple model in terms of boundary variables directly .",
    "these two options for classical models have not been sufficiently explored , and their quantum analogs write the amplitude of a history as a product of amplitudes associated with the connection on the boundaries of spacetime atoms , as originally proposed by reisenberger @xcite .",
    "_ decimation _ + our framework rests on a decimation map @xmath681 that produces sections in the discrete framework from sections in the continuum framework .",
    "_ regulariation _ + regularization plays two roles .",
    "the first one is to bring questions to scale @xmath265 from the continuum ; since the regularization map acts on functions , here we will write it as a pull back map @xmath682 , where @xmath683 .",
    "the second job of regularization is to give us a discrete action from the action in the continuum . in this work",
    "we do not commit to a particular regularization scheme .",
    "the structured discretization used in this article allows for a definition of hodge dual for cochains and a related definition of a laplacian along the lines described in @xcite . in the language used in those references ,",
    "the structured regularization used in our work includes the essential ingredients of the prime cellular decomposition and of the dual cellular decomposition unifying them into a single entity with ( structured ) atoms .",
    "thus , the important body of work contained in @xcite can be used , with small adjustments , to produce models within our framework .",
    "_ continuum limit of field equations and geometric structures _ + we developed geometric structures related to a discretization that traded partial differential equations for difference operators .",
    "a natural question is : + does a continuum limit reproduce partial differential equations from our difference operators , and does it yield limiting structures matching the corresponding structures in the continuum ? + veselov studies this issue and concludes that , the structure of some of his models converges to the continuum structures @xcite . for our discrete field theories",
    "we can consider the same continuum limit , and study its convergence : in the case of the scalar field , we fix a smooth section @xmath276 and a variation of it @xmath684 ; then we decimate them to each of a sequence of refining scales @xmath685 producing @xmath686 , @xmath687 .",
    "the limit to be studied is @xmath688 .\\ ] ] convergence to the appropriate continuum limit implies the convergence of both @xmath689 @xmath690 the continuum limit of all the models that we presented reproduces the original continuum model in this sense .",
    "the models that require a more delicate analysis are the lattice gauge theory model and reisenberger s simplicial gravity model ; the continuum limit of our lattice gauge theory model can be studied following the route usually followed for wilson s lattice gauge theory @xcite , and the continuum limit of reisenberger s model is carefully studied in @xcite .",
    "_ continuum limit of solutions _ + a more ambitious objective is the study of convergence of solutions in a continuum limit .",
    "the first step is to fix boundary conditions ( or initial conditions ) in the continuum @xmath691 and coarse grain them to a refining sequence of scales obtaining the corresponding conditions at each scale @xmath692 .",
    "the second step is to find a solution at each scale @xmath693 and bring it to the continuum using the map @xmath694 .",
    "clearly , finding solutions is a very delicate issue in which the details of the discrete model have an impact .",
    "( for studies related to this issue see @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "the third step is to study the limit @xmath695 .",
    "alternatively , we can study the continuum limit using evaluations of a family of observables from the continuum @xmath696 quantum lattice field theories give predictions about observables from the continuum following the same strategy ; at each scale a measure is constructed ( after adjusting the coupling constants ) and the convergence of the @xmath267-point functions ( or the wilson loops ) is studied @xcite . in this respect , loop quantum field theories have the interpretation of being the continuum limit constructed from effective theories in exactly this way @xcite .",
    "_ correction of the structures at a given scale _ + two different scales may be related by coarse graining ( by decimation in our case ) . since our decimation preserves locality , the map can be written in the local first order format .",
    "consider an atom of scale @xmath265 written in scale @xmath697 as a chain of atoms @xmath698 . in the case of the scalar field",
    "we require that there is a @xmath697-atom @xmath699 such that @xmath700 , and that in the decomposition of @xmath91 at scale @xmath697 we have boundary faces @xmath701 such that @xmath702 .",
    "in this situation , the coarse grained history @xmath703 is defined as @xmath704 in the case of gauge degrees of freedom , where measuring at scale @xmath265 means selecting a collection of paths in spacetime , the condition necessary to have a coarse graining map by decimation is that each path in the mentioned collection of paths at scale @xmath265 is a composition of paths of scale @xmath697 ; the rest of the paths in @xmath697 are ignored .",
    "then we define @xmath705 the relation written above refers to a case in which the @xmath318 links of scale @xmath265 are compositions of @xmath318 links of scale @xmath697 , and @xmath319 links of scale @xmath265 are compositions of @xmath319 links of scale @xmath697 .",
    "it is always possible to refine a cellular decomposition in such a way that this property holds .",
    "the formalism can also deal with cases in which the @xmath318 links become compositions of @xmath318 and @xmath319 links .",
    "when a solution in a fine scale is coarse grained it goes to a history which in general is not a solution ; the multisymplectic formula and noether s conservation law do not hold on it .",
    "the action at the coarse scale can be corrected @xcite , which corrects the equations of motion and the geometric structures fixing the incompatibility mentioned above .",
    "this is the classical analog of coarse graining the measure in statistical field theory and quantum field theory .",
    "the procedure for correcting the action is the following : given a state @xmath276 at scale @xmath265 , the action at scale @xmath697 poses a variational problem among the states at scale @xmath697 that satisfy @xmath706 .",
    "if @xmath567 is a minimum of the mentioned variational problem , the value of the corrected action at scale @xmath265 on @xmath276 is defined to be @xmath707 there are several examples where this strategy has been successful .",
    "an interesting explicit example is the implementation of this program for a reparametrization invariant path integral @xcite .",
    "in 1-dimensional spacetimes , the boundary data of each atom @xmath31 at scale @xmath265 provides boundary data at the finer scale @xmath697 that may determine a solution .",
    "if we consider the variational problem with this boundary data at finer and finer scales , @xmath708 may converge to the continuum value @xmath709 , which is hamilton s principal function for the given boundary data .",
    "on the other hand , if we follow the same procedure in spacetimes of higher dimensions , the data on @xmath91 available at scale @xmath265 is not enough to determine solutions inside @xmath31 for models defined at finer scales .",
    "boundary data @xmath468 at scale @xmath265 determines an ensemble of @xmath697 boundary data , @xmath710 .",
    "the obvious draw back of working with corrected actions to achieve compatibility of different scales is the need of solving , or partially solving , the variational problem .",
    "this should not arise as a surprise , since the incompatibility that motivated correction involves two scales related by coarse graining and coarse grained _ solutions _ at the fine scale . on the other hand ,",
    "we had found compatibility at the level of the field equations and the geometric structures ( in the continuum limit ) .    in the quantum theory",
    "one can use coarse graining map to define a continuum limit through an inverse limit .",
    "this continuum limit is related to the continuum limit of solutions described above ; a description of both limits and their relation in the terminology used in this work appears in @xcite .",
    "our formalism provides a classical counterpart to spin foam models , in which spacetime atoms @xmath31 are autonomous minimal regions of spacetime that enjoy a complete version of the formalism . in our framework",
    ", the variation of the action decomposes into bulk and boundary terms @xmath410 = - \\sum_{u -\\partial u } \\tilde{a}^\\ast(\\tilde{v } \\lrcorner \\hat{\\omega}_l )   +   \\sum_{\\partial u }   \\tilde{a}^\\ast(\\tilde{v } \\lrcorner \\theta_l)$ ] giving origin to geometrical structure .",
    "first of all , the form @xmath78 provides a covariant momentum map linking symmetries and conserved quantities , and it generates the multisymplectic form @xmath133 which is conserved in covariant evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the form @xmath85 is responsible for the equations of motion in the interior of spacetime atoms and for the simple gluing conditions that let us find solutions on larger regions of spacetime amalgamating solutions over atoms .",
    "the clean separation between bulk and boundary parts makes gluing transparent : neighboring regions share boundary data and gluing conditions asking for momentum matching appear when regions are fused .",
    "these structures have ( some times implicit ) quantum counterparts in spin foam models .",
    "we hope that our contribution , making available the classical counterparts of such structural properties , makes it possible for some research lines to advance further or enter a new level .",
    "one example is the study of the semiclassical limit of quantum gravity spin foam models , in which most of the research has been carried on at the level of a single atom ; this study may now progress to study larger regions of spacetime aided with compatible the structures of quantum and classical gluing .    in the case of lattice gauge theories",
    ", the transfer matrix for lattice gauge theory can be constructed gluing cellular propagators ( or `` atomic propagators '' in the terminology used here ) ; in this article we wrote the discrete field equations for the classical atomic propagator which is the classical counterpart of the mentioned atomic propagator .",
    "we presented a lagrangian picture and a hamiltonian picture with their respective structures and compatibility with the mentioned classical cellular propagator .",
    "along this line , comparing our formalism with the classical hamiltonian formalism of kogut and susskind @xcite would be interesting .",
    "another line suggested by our framework is investigating the classical counterpart of the heat kernel action , and study the resulting theory because it is the most elegant spin foam model for lattice gauge theory @xcite .    with quantum gravity in mind ,",
    "the first thing to mention is that most of our study of reisenberger s model in subsection [ michaelsmodel ] would carry over to any other model with similar degrees of freedom and gauge symmetries .",
    "the model s action determines a covariant legendre transform bringing the canonical structure of the discrete dual jet bundle to the lagrangian setting . since the boundary variables in each atom are @xmath638 group elements assigned to every boundary link , in the canonical side the atomic phase space boundary data consist of a collection of cotangent bundles @xmath711 ; in the discussion of reisenberger s model we showed how to relate this data to data for twisted geometries @xcite and spinning geometries @xcite . for solutions to the field equations we have the conservation law given by the multisymplectic formula linking the pieces of @xmath672-geometry at the boundary of a region .",
    "the clear question is what is the 4-geometry corresponding to histories ( or at least to solutions ) compatible with a given @xmath672-geometry at the boundary ?    does regge calculus ( written in appropriate variables ) fit as one of the examples of the `` atomic boundary data '' formalism presented in this article ?",
    "we think that this project may not be a difficult one , given that regge calculus is a well - studied subject with many previous and recent results .",
    "we should mention that the work of dittrich and hhn @xcite studies regge calculus from a covariant hamiltonian view point .",
    "their procedure uses a slightly different language , but their results could be described as including an implementation of what we describe in section [ canonical ] mixed with sorkin s method for constructing solutions @xcite .",
    "since our framework includes tools to study coarse graining , this opens another avenue of study .",
    "the study of classical coarse graining may also help us get a sharper understanding of coarse graining of quantum models and the study of a macroscopic limit .",
    "let us also comment on the possibility of using this finite - dimensional discrete framework to investigate a covariant version of geometric quantization .",
    "here we have a family of classical models and a corresponding family of quantum models waiting for the quantization problem to be clearly stated and tackled . in this respect ,",
    "the presence of the general boundary field theory formalism @xcite provides the conceptual framework needed for this enterprise .",
    "we consider that the development of geometric quantization along these lines would provide a more complete understanding of quantum physics within the gbft perspective",
    ".    finally , we comment on the comparison between our framework and previous approaches to discrete multisymplectic field theory . with the objective of comparing those frameworks",
    ", we developed the reduced formalism presented in section [ reduced ] .",
    "we showed that the formalisms are equivalent in the sense of the relation between their spaces of solutions .",
    "the main disadvantage of reduced models as compared to the original models on a structured discretization is that the geometric structure is not simple any more .",
    "recall that in our original framework the geometric structure was independent of the potential .",
    "the conservation laws had the same form as those of a free theory , while complications were secluded to solving the field equations .",
    "in contrast , for the reduced system the expressions for the conservation of the symplectic structure and for noether s theorem may be complicated .",
    "given that the main importance of conservation laws is to give information about the system even when solving the field equations is difficult or impossible , having simple expressions for the conservation laws is a significative advantage of our non - reduced framework .",
    "we hope that the simplicity of our conservation laws is used in future numerical applications .",
