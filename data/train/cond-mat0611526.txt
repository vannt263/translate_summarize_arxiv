    "if the chain length decreases , the chain stiffness becomes an important factor .",
    "many polymer molecules have internal stiffness and can not be modeled by the model of flexible polymers developed by edwards @xcite .",
    "the standard coarse - graining model of a wormlike polymer was proposed by kratky and porod @xcite .",
    "the essential ingredients of this model are the penalty for the bending energy and the local inextensibility .",
    "the latter makes the treatment of the model much more difficult .",
    "there have been a substantial number of studies of the kratky - porod model in the last half century @xcite-@xcite ( and citations therein ) . in recent years",
    "there has been increasing interest in the theoretical description of semiflexible polymers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the reason for this interest is due to potential applications in biology allemand05 ( and citations therein ) and in research on semicrystalline polymers @xcite .",

    "in this paper we study the transverse distribution function @xmath3 of the three dimensional wormlike chain with a fixed orientation @xmath4 of one polymer end using the exact representation of the distribution function in terms of the matrix element of the green s function of the quantum rigid rotator in a homogeneous external field @xcite .",

    "the results show that the distribution function possesses the bimodal shape at intermediate chain lengths within the interval @xmath86 .",
    "we also find that the distribution function becomes gaussian for very short and very long chains . at the onset",
    "there is a tiny maximum at @xmath87 , which we interpret as remnant of the gaussian behavior of short chains .",
    "the maximum at @xmath87 for 3d chain is a rather small effect , which is difficult to be explained in a qualitative way .",
    "we now will discuss qualitatively the origin of the bimodal behavior of the projected distribution function of the free end of the wormlike chain .",
    "the very short wormlike chain behaves similar to a weakly bending stiff rod , so that the distribution function of the free end is gaussian with the maximum at @xmath87 .",
    "the typical conformation of the chain in this regime looks like a bending rod with constant sign of curvature along the chain . for larger contour lengths",
    "the curvature fluctuations are small and are still controlled by the bending energy , however with varying sign of curvatures along the chain .",
    "the typical conformation of the chain can be imagined as undulations along the average conformation of the polymer .",
    "the projected distribution function of the free end in this regime is expected to be roughly uniform within some range of @xmath88 .",
    "we expect that the inhomogeneities of curvature fluctuations in the vicinity of the clamped end are the reason for the maximum at @xmath89 .",
    "the larger curvatures in the vicinity of the fixed end result in larger displacements @xmath88 of the free end , and therefore contribute preferentially to the maximum at @xmath89 . with further increase of @xmath37",
    "the conformations correspond to undulations around the average conformation of the chain , which is now a meandering line .",
    "fluctuations become now less controlled by bending energy , which results in weakening of the bimodality . since the difference between 2d and 3d chain is assumed to be marginal for short chains on the projected distribution function , we will compare the onset of the bimodality in both cases .",
    "because the transversal displacement is measured in both cases in units of the contour length , we have to recompute the number of segments for 3d and 2d chain at the onset according to @xmath90using the dependence of the persistence length on dimensionality benetatos05 , @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 . according to @xcite @xmath93 at the onset ,",
    "hence we obtain @xmath94 , which is not far from our numerical result , @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - doublepeak ] ) .     for chain length @xmath96 .",
    "squares : truncation with @xmath97 matrices ; continuous line : truncation with @xmath84 matrices . ]",
    "we now will address the issues of accuracy of the calculations , which depends on the size of the matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the maximal @xmath23 at which the summation over @xmath23 is stopped . in order to check our computation",
    "we verified that at large @xmath37 ( @xmath98 ) the numerical evaluation of ( gyn ) gives with very high accuracy the gaussian distribution @xmath99 .",
    "the general tendency is such that the sufficient level of matrix truncations and the number of terms in the expansion over the legendre polynomials increase with decreasing @xmath37 . in the limit @xmath24",
    "the whole series over @xmath23 should be taken into account .",
    "the accuracy of the computations is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - n0 - 5 ] showing the computation of the distribution function for @xmath96 .",
    "the squares and the continuous curve correspond to the truncations by @xmath97 matrices and @xmath84 matrices , respectively . in both cases the summation was stopped at @xmath85 .",
    "the corrections due to higher @xmath23-s are negligibly small .",
    "for example , the corrections associated with @xmath100 and @xmath101 contribute only in 3rd and 5th decimal digits , respectively .",
    "thus , the computations depicted in figs . [ fig - doublepeak ] , [ fig - n0 - 5 ] can be considered as exact .    figure [ figure3 ] shows the results of the computation of the 3d distribution functions @xmath102 of the free polymer obtained by performing the inverse laplace - fourier transform of the term @xmath49 in eq .",

    "to conclude , we have studied the transverse distribution function of the free end of the three dimensional wormlike chain with fixed orientation and position of the second end using the exact solution for the green s function of the wormlike chain . within the procedure of truncations of the exact formula with finite order matrices",
    "we find that the distribution function @xmath108 for intermediate chain lengths , belonging to the interval @xmath0 , possesses the bimodal shape with the maxima at a finite value of the transverse displacement , which is consistent with the recent studies @xcite and @xcite for the two dimensional chain .",
    "in contrast to the 2d wormlike chain , the transverse 1d distribution function of the 3d chain shows only a tiny peak at @xmath87 in the vicinity of the onset of bimodality , which however disappears for larger @xmath37 .",
