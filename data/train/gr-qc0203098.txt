    "what is the mass of the galaxy ? we answer this question by computing , in a model metric of the galaxy , the travel time of light beams in a michelson type interferometer located on earth s equator .",
    "we show that the light travel time is proportional to the mass of  the galaxy .",
    "the result suggests that an experiment can measure the mass of the galaxy .            in this section",
    "we calculate the travel time of a beam of light traveling along the @xmath3direction .",
    "the beam is located on earth s equator @xmath4 , a coordinate distance @xmath5 from the field center .",
    "the interferometer orbits about the field center with a constant coordinate speed @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the coordinate angular speed .",
    "the trajectory of light is a null geodesic , furthermore , @xmath8 :      we neglect the difference between a null geodesic and an arc of an equatorial circle ( valid when the coordinate arm length of the interferometer @xmath10",
    "@xmath11 @xmath5 ) .",
    "the world line of the light beam between the two mirrors is :                                                we repeat the calculation for a light beam traveling inward from the beam - splitter at @xmath29 to the end mirror a coordinate distance @xmath10 at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . in this case @xmath32 .",
    "the coordinate length of the interferometer arm is @xmath10 .",
    "the world line of the mirror is              in the example under consideration we can approximate the space trajectory of the light beam as a straight line starting from the origin at @xmath37 and passing through @xmath38",
    ". we can relate @xmath39 with @xmath40                                                                            where the angle @xmath73 is complementary to @xmath74 .",
    "the integral limits are chosen as @xmath75 and @xmath15 instead of @xmath76and @xmath77 because @xmath78 is the angle subtended by the interferometer arms .",
    "the @xmath79 s maintain the values they have at the equator because we approximate the rays as straight lines on a sphere of radius @xmath5 .",
    "the rays have a space trajectory              thus@xmath83the reverse path , calculated with a ( @xmath84 sign outside the radical in ( 1.51 ) , is just the same i.e. , @xmath85 , thus the total time of flight is@xmath86\\end{aligned}\\]]in terms of proper time          it is worth emphasizing that the differences are in proper time ; the result is independent of any coordinate system . indeed a careful calculation using isotropic or harmonic schwarzschild coordinates confirms this assertion as does a calculation using an expansion about a point .",
    "these results are not really new ; they conform to other relativistic time delay phenomena such as the radar - echo experiment of shapiro as well as the clock corrections needed for gps navigation satellites .",
    "why is there a measurable effect proportional to the potential @xmath96 , when one can always define a new set of coordinates to make @xmath97 at @xmath39 ?",
    "the answer lies in the extended reach of the interferometer ; it is not possible , except in flat space , to make the potential zero everywhere over an extended region .",
    "the interferometer measures a potential _ average _ over a @xmath98 space - like region .",
    "this is not zero ; and can not be made zero everywhere within the region using a single transformation .",
    "an alternative explanation is this : two null vectors are transported simultaneously , in closed paths , along two orthogonal axes ; when they return to the origin there is an angle defect between them , which is , as expected , a first order effect in @xmath96 .      as the interferometer rotates with earth the output measures alternately , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the signal appears as alternating bright and dark regions in the combined beam .",
    "the interferometer is located at the equator ( assumed only to simplify the discussion ) , with the two arms aligned west - east and north - south .",
    "as the interferometer rotates with earth , the north - south arm maintains its relative alignment ( this is not strictly true but we make this assumption to simplify the discussion ) with the galactic center while the orientation of west - east arm alternates between the radial and azimuthal directions every 12 hours .",
    "the signal is sinusoidal , modulated with a period of 12 hours ; it can be recovered using a homodyne detector .",
    "this is a null experiment in the sense that the appropriate phase of the dynamic output is zero in the absence of any general relativistic effect , the output measures only deviations from a flat metric .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the computed general relativistic fringe shift is for _ each round - trip _ of the light beam .",
    "the fringe shift is the result of transporting , in a closed loop , a null vector in curved space .",
    "each subsequent round - trip adds to the fringe shift from the previous cycle .",
    "by contrast a fringe shift in flat space is not cumulative ; it is static .",
    "each round - trip , which takes @xmath101seconds , contributes @xmath102 of a fringe shift .",
    "thus the fringe shift is wiped out every 5 round - trips or in @xmath103seconds . in order to observe the fringe shift",
    "one needs to strobe the output signal with a frequency which is the inverse of @xmath104seconds or @xmath105 ghz .",
    "anisotropic lorentz contraction of the interferometer arms ( 1.47 ) will occur with a magnitude @xmath106 .",
    "this is smaller than the expected signal but also @xmath107 out of phase with it , hence distinguishable .",
    "although we have assumed that the length of both interferometer arms is exactly equal , this will not be so in practice , nor is it necessary .",
    "any remnant inequality will show up as a zero - offset in the sinusoidal signal .    a time delay of @xmath108 secs .",
    "corresponds to @xmath109 of a fringe shift .",
    "is this measurable in the presence of noise from sources such as mechanical / thermal noise , photodetector noise ; mechanical distortions such as sag and tilt , seismic noise , laser intensity fluctuations , laser wavelength / frequency fluctuations etc.@xcite ?",
    "the effect we are looking for is independent of wavelength , so neither laser wavelength nor intensity fluctuations nor drift will affect the result if the apparatus is kept in a vacuum environment .",
    "however , the interference condition does depend on wavelength , so the laser wavelength needs to be stable to @xmath110 of a wavelength .    among the noise sources listed ,",
    "the most relevant is thermal stability since we are looking for a change in apparent length .",
    "low - expansion substances such as zerodur or sapphire would be suitable platform materials . with expansion coefficients of @xmath111 a length of 10 cm",
    "can be kept to within @xmath112 by controlling the temperature to within @xmath113k .",
    "this is a modest challenge at room temperatures .",
    "one may ask why this relatively large effect was not detected in experiments going back to that of michelson and morley .",
    "we have studied published accounts @xcite and have concluded , tentatively , that the apparatuses and methods used were neither sensitive to nor designed to measure what we are proposing .",
    "the second would be a challenge ; it may require a cryogenic environment where temperature stabilities of @xmath115k are possible .",
    "this , combined with an expansion coefficient of sapphire at 4k which is estimated to be @xmath116 , may reduce thermal stability to @xmath117@xcite .",
    "the galactic center would provide a strong background for the second experiment .",
    "it may be possible to extract the solar signal by monitoring the interferometer output during months of june and december when the sun , earth and galactic center are aligned , then during march and september when they form a right angle triangle .",
    "the two signals , with different amplitudes , will have a relative phase which will progress from @xmath118 to 90@xmath119 between december and march ."
