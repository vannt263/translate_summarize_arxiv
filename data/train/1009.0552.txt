    "the density of states for the two different spin orientations differ considerably . while one spin - orientation ( spin - down in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_feti ] ) gives rise to a level in the band gap ( feature b in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_feti ] ) , the other one leads to additional states at the top of the valence band ( feature c in fig .  [ fig : spin_feti ] ) . as in the case of copper",
    ", strong hybridization occurs between the impurity atom 3d - orbitals and the o2p levels of the host material .",
    "also , in equivalence to copper fe3d levels do practically not contribute to the conduction band , slightly diminishing the density of states at the bottom of this band .",
    "due to the presence of gap states defect induced holes and electrons can not be unambiguously identified .",
    "in contrast to copper , a simple correlation between the krger - vink notation for defects and the charge states , @xmath15 , is , therefore , not possible .    the potentials for the redox reactions @xmath87 and",
    "@xmath88 have been measured in aqueous solution to be 0.77ev and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "based on these values and using the data for the electron affinity and the band gap cited above , one would expect transition levels at 1.6ev ( @xmath90 , i.e. @xmath91 ) and 2.8ev ( @xmath92 , i.e. @xmath93 ) with respect to the experimental valence band maximum .",
    "in contrast , the present calculations indicate transitions about 0.15ev above the vbm and 0.39ev below the cbm .",
    "the analogy with the behavior of ions in solution , which worked reasonably in the case of copper , thus appears to fail for iron .",

    "the binding energies for fe impurities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bind_extrapol_fe ] are in general smaller than for copper and for fermi levels very close to the valence band the binding energy can even become positive .",
    "nonetheless for most conditions there is a rather strong ( @xmath95 ) driving force for association .",
    "analysis of the spin density shows that for both isolated and associated iron impurities unpaired electrons are localized in the d - electron states at the iron site ( table  [ tab : eform_feti ] ) .",
    "it furthermore reveals that in both cases the spin density pattern is symmetric with respect to fourfold rotations about the tetragonal axis . unlike in the case of copper - vacancy associates",
    "the ( 001 ) plane is , however , not a mirror plane .",
    "the results obtained in this study need to be discussed in the context of degradation phenomena in ferroelectric materials .",
    "two distinct processes have been widely described : ( 1 ) the gradual degradation of ferroelectric properties ( usually over extended periods of time ) in the absence of electric fields is termed `` aging '' .",
    "@xcite this process is commonly attributed to an increasing restriction of domain - wall motion with time @xcite and typically accompanied by a shift of the ferroelectric hysteresis loop along the electric field axis .",
    "@xcite the shift is known as the _ internal bias field _ and it has been proposed to be related to the relaxation of defect dipoles .",
    "@xcite in general , acceptor - doped ferroelectric ceramics with high concentrations of oxygen vacancies are particularly prone to aging .",
    "( 2 ) the degradation of ferroelectric properties in the presence of a ( usually oscillating ) electric field is termed electric `` fatigue '' .",
    "there are various contributions to this phenomenon and possible explanations involve defects of all kinds .",
    "the most widely known model for aging @xcite relates the appearance of internal bias fields to the existence and gradual reorientation of impurity - oxygen vacancy defect dipoles .",
    "similar models have been discussed in the literature @xcite experimentally , an increased internal bias field has been observed for aged lead zirconate - titanate compounds and was attributed to defect dipole alignment leading to a clamping of domain walls.@xcite    the availability of microscopic information on the energy landscape for defect formation and migration is the key ingredient for the these models .",
    "the present work provides a data base for these model and allow to verify their basic assumptions .    the key information regarding the orientation and the magnitude of the defect dipoles as well as their energetic ordering is summarized in fig .  [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "this picture needs to be compared to the energy landscape proposed by arlt and neumann @xcite on the basis of electrostatic arguments ( figs .  4 in refs .   and ) .",
    "the latter analysis was carried out for barium titanate and involved several crucial assumptions with respect to e.g. , the magnitude of the local dipole moment or the dielectric constant in the vicinity of the defect center . in agreement with the conclusions of the arlt - neumann model ,",
    "the quantum - mechanical calculations show that for the energetically most stable configuration ( @xmath71 ) the defect induced dipole is oriented parallel to the overall spontaneous polarization , @xmath96 ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "thus in equilibrium ( i.e. , a state which would be achieved after `` infinite '' aging ) the polarization locally increases due the formation and alignment of local defect dipoles .",
    "in contrast , the defect dipole of the alternative @xmath30-axis configuration ( @xmath73 ) causes a local reduction of the polarization .    in ref .",
    "two estimates for the energy differences between different dipole orientations are derived .",
    "the first one treats the defect as a sphere with a defect induced polarization embedded in a ferroelectric matrix .",
    "it yields values on the order of 0.5 to 1.2ev ( compare equations ( 8a-8c ) in ref .  ) which are of a similar magnitude as the values obtained from the present calculations .",
    "the second estimate is based on the model of an ideal point dipole and yields much smaller energy differences on the order of 0.03 to 0.06ev ( equation ( 9 ) in ref .  ) .",
    "it is important to realize that the modeling of aging carried out in the same paper was actually based on the latter values .",
    "in fact the energy differences obtained in the present work are actually on the order of magnitude of the barriers for the migration of free oxygen vacancies in this system ( 0.8 - 1.0ev , see e.g. ref .  ) . in the vicinity of impurities the energy surface , which describes the barriers for the transformation of different defect dipole configurations into each other ,",
    "is therefore severely distorted.@xcite this effect is important for the behavior of defect dipoles in the presence of oscillating electric fields , which pertains to the fatigue of the material .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] highlights a noteworthy difference between cu and fe .",
    "while for cu - complexes the energy difference between @xmath97^{\\times}$ ] and @xmath98^{\\times}$ ] is as large as @xmath99 , for @xmath100^{{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\bullet}}}$ ] and @xmath101^{{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\bullet}}}$ ] the difference is just 0.45ev .",
    "this difference has implications for the redistribution of the defect dipoles in the presence of an oscillating electric field and thus for the process of fatigue .",
    "a detailed account of these behavior will be published elsewhere.@xcite",
    "this paper presents a comprehensive and detailed investigation of fe and cu dopants / impurities in tetragonal lead titanate .",
    "both metal ions are found to be very effective traps for oxygen vacancies . in the most stable configurations",
    "the oxygen vacancy is located on a @xmath30-site such that the @xmath0 distance is minimal , and the defect dipole is aligned parallel the spontaneous polarization .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with an electrostatic analysis of the defect induced dipole field .",
    "an alternative configuration ( @xmath73 ) in which the dipole is oriented anti - parallel with respect to the spontaneous polarization is somewhat higher energy but is anticipated to be of importance for the fatigue of lead titanate based ferroelectrics .",
    "since all relevant defects considered in this investigation carry unpaired electrons , they are visible for electron spectroscopic methods . in fact , by means of analyzing the spin density patterns for different defects it was possible to interpret recent electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and to resolve an apparent disagreement between experiment and calculations.@xcite the results obtained in this study represent important information on the energy landscape for energy formation and association and provide the basis for the improvement of defect models for the degradation of ferroelectric materials .",
