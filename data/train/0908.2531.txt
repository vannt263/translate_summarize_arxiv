    "diffractive events in high - energy @xmath0 or @xmath1 collisions are characterized by the presence of a leading proton or antiproton , which remains intact , and/or by a rapidity gap , defined as a ( pseudo-)rapidity region devoid of particles .",
    "theoretically , diffractive interactions are described in the framework of regge theory @xcite as the exchange of a trajectory with vacuum quantum numbers , the so - called pomeron ( @xmath2 ) trajectory .",
    "diffractive scattering involving hard processes ( hard diffraction ) such as the production of high-@xmath3 jets has been studied experimentally to investigate the parton content of the pomeron ( or additional lower - lying regge poles ) . in this framework ,",
    "@xmath0 hard diffraction can be expressed as a two - step process , @xmath4 , and similarly diffractive deep - inelastic scattering ( ddis ) as @xmath5 .",
    "the subprocess @xmath6 is interpreted as deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) on the pomeron target for the case that the virtuality of the exchanged photon @xmath7 is sufficiently large . in analogy",
    "to dis on a proton target , @xmath8 , the cross section for dis on a pomeron target is expressed as a convolution of partonic cross section and universal parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the pomeron .",
    "the partonic cross sections are the same as for @xmath9 dis .",
    "the pomeron pdfs are multiplied with vertex functions for the vertex @xmath10 , yielding the diffractive pdfs ( dpdfs ) .",
    "the additional vertex functions depend on the fractional momentum loss @xmath11 and the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath12 of the recoiling proton .",
    "the ddis experiments measure the diffractive structure function of the proton @xmath13 integrated over @xmath12 , where @xmath14 is the momentum fraction of the parton in the pomeron and @xmath7 is the virtuality of the @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath7 evolution of the dpdfs is calculated with the usual dglap @xcite evolution equations known from @xmath8 dis . except for the @xmath7 evolution ,",
    "the dpdfs are not calculable in the framework of perturbative qcd and must be determined from experiment .",
    "such dpdfs have been obtained from the hera inclusive measurements of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a hard scale such as the squared photon virtuality @xmath7 in dis or a large transverse jet energy @xmath17 in hard diffractive processes , as for example in @xmath18 or @xmath19 , allows for the calculation of the corresponding partonic cross sections using perturbative qcd .",
    "the central issue is whether such hard diffractive processes obey qcd factorization , i.e.  can be calculated in terms of parton - level cross sections convolved with universal dpdfs .    for dis processes ,",
    "qcd factorization has been proven to hold @xcite , and dpdfs have been extracted at low and intermediate @xmath7 @xcite from high - precision inclusive measurements of the process @xmath20 using the usual dglap evolution equations .",
    "the proof of the factorization formula also appears to be valid for the direct part of photoproduction ( @xmath21 ) of jets @xcite .",
    "however , factorization does not hold for hard processes in diffractive hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the problem is that soft interactions between the ingoing hadrons and their remnants occur in both the initial and final states .",
    "this was also the result of experimental measurements by the cdf collaboration at the tevatron @xcite , where it was found that the single - diffractive dijet production cross section was suppressed by up to an order of magnitude as compared to the prediction based on dpdfs determined earlier by the h1 collaboration at hera @xcite .",
    "in the cdf experiment @xcite , the suppression factor was determined by comparing single - diffractive ( sd ) and non - diffractive ( nd ) events .",
    "sd events are triggered on a leading antiproton in the roman pot spectrometer and at least one jet , while the nd trigger requires only a jet in the cdf calorimeters .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 of sd to nd dijet production rates @xmath23 is in a first approximation proportional to the ratio of the corresponding structure functions @xmath24 ,",
    "i.e. r(x,,t ) = .",
    "an approximation to the sd structure function @xmath25 , @xmath26 , was obtained by multiplying the above ratio of rates by the known effective f_jj^nd(x ) = x[g(x)+_iq_i(x ) ] after integrating this ratio over @xmath11 and @xmath12 and changing variables from @xmath27 to @xmath28 using @xmath29 .",
    "the result was then compared to the dpdfs from h1 @xcite using the same approximate formula , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , relating the structure function to gluon and quark dpdfs as in the nd case .",
    "the above formula for the ratio @xmath22 is certainly not sufficient for estimating the suppression factor for diffractive dijet production in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "it is based on a leading order ( lo ) calculation of the cross section in the numerator and in the denominator .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that the convolutions of the pdfs in the numerator and the denominator with the partonic cross sections are identical and drop out in the ratio together with the pdfs for the ingoing proton .",
    "these approximations are not valid in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , where , in particular , the cross sections in the numerator and denominator depend on the jet algorithm and on the kinematics of the sd and nd processes .",
    "since 2002 , the two hera collaborations have presented results for diffractive dijet photoproduction in order to establish a possible suppression factor .",
    "the factorization breaking was first investigated on the basis of nlo predictions by us in 2004 @xcite by comparing to preliminary h1 data @xcite . already in 2004",
    "it became clear that in photoproduction the breaking could be shown only by comparing with nlo predictions , which produced by a factor of two larger cross sections than the lo predictions .",
    "concerning factorization breaking , the conclusions were the same based on a preliminary zeus analysis @xcite .",
    "both collaborations , h1 and zeus , have now published their final experimental data @xcite . whereas h1 confirm in @xcite their earlier findings based on the analysis of their preliminary data and preliminary dpdfs , the zeus collaboration @xcite reached somewhat different conclusions from their analysis .",
    "in particular , the h1 collaboration @xcite obtained a global suppression of their measured cross sections as compared to the nlo calculation of approximately @xmath30 .",
    "in addition they concluded that also the direct cross section together with the resolved one does not obey factorization .",
    "the zeus collaboration , however , concluded from their analysis @xcite that , within the large uncertainties of the nlo calculations and the differences in the dpdf input , their data are compatible with the nlo qcd calculation , i.e.  a suppression could not be deduced from their data . in several recent reviews ,",
    "we have shown , however , that the zeus data are compatible with the older h1 @xcite and with even more recent h1 data @xcite , if one adjusts the zeus large rapidity - gap inclusive dis diffractive data to the analogous h1 data , which are the basis of the recent h1 dpdfs @xcite and which are used to predict the diffractive dijet photoproduction cross sections . in these recent reviews",
    "@xcite we also investigated whether the nlo prediction with resolved suppression only , which would be more in line with the findings in @xcite , will also describe the h1 and zeus data in a satisfactory way .",
    "the result is , that this is indeed possible , and the resolved suppression factor is of the order of @xmath31 .",
    "for the global suppression , i.e.  direct and resolved component equally , the suppression factor is larger , and in addition , depends on @xmath32 , which is not the case for the resolved suppression only .    in this work",
    "we want to bring the theoretical analysis of diffractive dijet production in @xmath0 collisions to the same level as has been done for diffractive dijet photoproduction , i.e.  to calculate the cross sections up to nlo and then compare with the cdf data , to establish the suppression factor in the tevatron energy range . for this purpose",
    "we shall calculate the ratio @xmath22 . for this",
    "we need the nlo cross sections for sd and nd with the cuts as in the cdf measurements .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall describe shortly the kinematic restrictions for the cdf analysis based on measurements at run i for @xmath33 gev @xcite and on measurements at @xmath34 gev and @xmath33 gev @xcite obtained for comparison at two different center - of - mass energies . in this section",
    "we shall also specify the various inputs for our calculation .",
    "our results and the comparison with the cdf data are presented in sect .",
    "the first @xmath35 gev data are compared with the calculations in sect .",
    "the comparative study of the 630 and the new 1800 gev cross sections are presented in sect .  3.2",
    ". an interpretation of the observed suppression factor is given in sect .",
    "4 contains a summary and our conclusions .",
    "the data , which we want to compare our nlo calculations with , are published in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .  @xcite . in the first paper @xcite , the cdf collaboration measured non - diffractive and single - diffractive dijet cross sections at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath33 gev using run ic ( 1995 - 1996 ) data . from an inclusive sample of single - diffraction ( sd ) events , @xmath36 ,",
    "triggering on a @xmath37 detected in a forward roman pot spectrometer , a diffractive dijet subsample with transverse energy @xmath38 gev was selected .",
    "in addition to the two leading jets , these events contain other lower-@xmath3 jets .",
    "similarly , a non - diffractive ( nd ) dijet sample was selected . from the @xmath3 and the rapidity @xmath39 of the jets ,",
    "the fraction @xmath40 of the momentum of the antiproton carried by the struck parton was calculated , where @xmath40 is given by x_|p= _",
    "i e_t^i e^-^i .",
    "the jets were detected and their energy measured by calorimeters covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath17 was defined as the sum of the calorimeter @xmath3 s within an @xmath42 cone of radius 0.7 .",
    "the jet energy correction included a subtraction of an average underlying event of @xmath3 of 0.54 ( 1.16 ) gev for diffractive ( non - diffractive ) events .",
    "the recoil antiproton fractional momentum loss @xmath11 and four - momentum transfer squared @xmath12 were in the range @xmath43 and @xmath44 gev@xmath45 , respectively , which was in the final sample restricted to @xmath46 gev@xmath45 . in the second paper @xcite",
    ", the study of diffractive dijet events was extended to @xmath34 gev .",
    "these data were compared to new measurements at @xmath33 gev in order to test regge factorization .",
    "this study is similar to the previous diffractive dijet study in experimental setup and methodology . for the sd sample ,",
    "the @xmath11-region is the same , @xmath47 , but @xmath48 gev@xmath45 .",
    "again in the sd sample events with at least two jets with @xmath38 gev were selected , where again the @xmath17 was defined as the sum of the calorimeter @xmath3 s within a cone of 0.7 in @xmath42 space .",
    "the jet energy correction included a subtraction of an average underlying event of 0.5 ( 0.9 ) gev for sd ( nd ) events .",
    "the calculation of the cross sections for dijet production in non - diffractive and single - diffractive processes has been performed up to nlo . for the comparison we have calculated these cross sections also in lo . for our calculations ,",
    "we rely on our work on dijet production in the reaction @xmath49 @xcite , in which we have calculated the cross sections for inclusive one - jet and two - jet production up to nlo for both the direct and the resolved contribution .",
    "the version for the resolved contribution can be used immediately for two - jet production in @xmath0 collisions by substituting for the photon pdf the antiproton pdf ( for nd ) or the pomeron pdf ( for sd ) .",
    "for the ( anti-)proton pdf we have chosen the version cteq6.6 m @xcite for the nlo calculation with @xmath50 active flavors .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath51 is calculated from the two - loop formula with @xmath52 mev . for the calculation in lo",
    "we have chosen cteq6l1 @xcite with @xmath51 determined from the one - loop formula and @xmath53 mev .",
    "the diffractive pdfs are taken from the recent h1 fits to the inclusive diffractive dis data @xcite .",
    "they are only available at nlo and come in two versions , h1 2006 fit a and h1 2006 fit b. these differ mostly in the gluon density , which is poorly constrained by the inclusive diffractive scattering data , since there is no direct coupling of the photon to gluons , so that the gluon density is constrained only through the evolution .",
    "the h1 2006 fit a has a much larger gluon for larger momentum fractions @xmath28 at the starting scale of @xmath54 gev than fit b , which leads to a larger gluon also for larger scales @xmath55 .",
    "the original fit on the data in @xcite is performed with @xmath56 massless flavors .",
    "the production of charm quarks was treated in the fixed - flavor number scheme ( ffns ) in nlo with non - zero charm - quark mass yielding a diffractive @xmath57 .",
    "this @xmath57 is contained in the h1 fit 2006 a , b parameterizations and is then converted into a charm pdf .",
    "the h1 collaboration constructed a third set of dpdfs , which is called the h1 2007 fit jets and which is obtained through a simultaneous fit to the diffractive dis inclusive and dijet cross sections @xcite .",
    "it is performed under the assumption that there is no factorization breaking in the diffractive dijet cross sections . including the diffractive dis dijet cross section in the analysis leads to additional constraints , mostly on the diffractive gluon distribution . on average ,",
    "the h1 2007 fit jets is similar to the h1 2006 fit b , except for the gluon distribution at large momentum fraction and small factorization scale .",
    "the dpdfs of h1 contain as a factor the vertex function @xmath58 , which describes the coupling of the pomeron to the proton , i.e.  the proton - proton - pomeron vertex .",
    "this vertex function is parameterized by the pomeron trajectory @xmath59 and an additional exponential dependence on @xmath12 .",
    "this function is used also for our calculations , as it has been determined by the h1 collaboration when fitting their data .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath60 of this function is included in the pomeron pdfs .",
    "therefore the h1 dpdfs are products of the pomeron flux factors and the pomeron pdfs .",
    "these h1 dpdfs include also low - mass proton dissociative processes with invariant mass @xmath61 gev , which increases the inclusive diffractive dis cross section as compared to cross sections with a pure ( anti-)proton final state .",
    "we have to keep this in mind , when we compare to the cdf data , which use a forward roman pot spectrometer to trigger on the final antiproton and therefore have no antiproton dissociative contributions .",
    "in this section we present our results and compare them to the experimental data obtained with @xmath62 tev in @xcite and to the more recent data with @xmath63 tev and @xmath62 tev published in @xcite . in this latter publication ,",
    "the kinematic constraints differ in some points from the constraints used in @xcite .",
    "first we compare to the normalized differential cross sections @xmath64 and @xmath65 for non - diffractive and diffractive dijet production .",
    "second , the ratio @xmath66 of the number of sd dijet events to the number of nd dijets is compared to the cdf data .",
    "this function @xmath66 , obtained by integrating the cross sections in the numerator of eq .",
    "( 1 ) over @xmath11 and @xmath12 , is the main result , and from the theoretical and experimental distribution as a function of @xmath40 the suppression factor @xmath67 can be deduced and can be studied for the three h1 dpdfs , h1 2006 fit a , h1 2006 fit b @xcite and h1 2007 fit jets @xcite for the nlo and the lo ( which has been done only for the h1 2006 fit b ) calculations .",
    "first we have calculated the distribution @xmath68 as a function of @xmath69 , where @xmath70 refers to the jet with the largest ( second largest ) @xmath3 for nd and sd dijet production with @xmath33 gev center - of - mass energy , integrated over the rapidities of the jets in the range @xmath71 .",
    "jets are defined with the usual cone algorithm within a chosen @xmath72 cone of radius @xmath73 and a partonic distance @xmath74 to match the experimental analysis @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 is the integrated cross section with the cut @xmath76 gev",
    ". the lower limit of the leading and subleading jet differ slightly in order to avoid infrared sensitivity in the computation of the nlo cross sections , when integrated over @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately in the experimental analysis such an asymmetric choice of @xmath78 and @xmath79 has not been made , since both @xmath78 and @xmath79 are restricted by @xmath80 gev , so that we do not know whether the choice @xmath81 gev is in accord with the experimental analysis .",
    "therefore we have also varied the @xmath79 cut slightly to @xmath82 gev .",
    "the results for @xmath83 are    normalized average transverse - energy distributions of the non - diffractive ( left ) and single - diffractive ( right ) dijet cross section at run i of the tevatron .",
    "the cdf data ( points ) are compared with our predictions at nlo ( full ) and lo ( dotted ) and also with a varied cut on the subleading jet @xmath3 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "the nlo scale uncertainty is shown as a shaded band ( color online).,title=\"fig : \" ] normalized average transverse - energy distributions of the non - diffractive ( left ) and single - diffractive ( right ) dijet cross section at run i of the tevatron .",
    "the cdf data ( points ) are compared with our predictions at nlo ( full ) and lo ( dotted ) and also with a varied cut on the subleading jet @xmath3 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "the nlo scale uncertainty is shown as a shaded band ( color online).,title=\"fig : \" ]    shown in fig .  1 ( left ) for @xmath81 gev ( full histogram ) and @xmath82 gev ( dot - dashed histogram ) , respectively .",
    "together with the nlo cross section , we also show the lo cross section ( dotted histogram ) and the scale variation of the nlo result ( shaded band ) , where the renormalization and factorization scales are varied simultaneously by factors of 0.5 and 2.0 compared to the default scale , which is chosen equal to @xmath78 , i.e.  the largest @xmath3 of both jets . as is often the case , the scale uncertainty is relatively small in the normalized distributions . in fig .  1 ( left ) we have included also the measured cross section from @xcite , which unfortunately is given without the experimental uncertainties . besides the statistical errors , which should be similar to those in the single - diffractive distributions given the similar number of nd and sd events @xcite",
    ", there are also systematic errors , as for example those associated with the jet energy scale .",
    "these would be needed for a fair comparison .",
    "second , the theoretical cross sections should be corrected for hadronization effects when comparing to data .",
    "these are not known to us , but could be calculated through monte carlo models . if we compare the calculations in fig .  1 ( left ) with the data",
    ", we observe that the results with @xmath81 gev agree reasonably well with the data in the large @xmath77 range , @xmath84 gev , but much less for the low and medium @xmath77 range .",
    "conversely , for @xmath82 gev the small and medium @xmath77 range agrees better and the large @xmath77 range less .",
    "the experimental errors will be larger in the large @xmath77 range .",
    "therefore the cross section with the cut @xmath82 gev would be preferred , in particular also because we have perfect agreement in the first , second and third @xmath77 bin , which are the most important ones for the integrated cross section @xmath75 , which determines the normalization .    the equivalent comparison for the sd dijet @xmath77-distribution is shown in fig .  1 ( right ) for @xmath85 gev ( full ) and @xmath86 gev ( dot - dashed ) . here",
    "we have chosen only the h1 2006 fit b as dpdf .",
    "the comparison of data versus theory in fig .",
    "1 ( right ) shows the same pattern as for the nd distributions in fig .  1 ( left ) . in general the agreement with the data",
    "is even somewhat better now , in particular for the @xmath87 gev cut . as for the nd distribution ,",
    "we present also the lo prediction ( dotted ) . from the unnormalized distributions ( not shown ) , we obtain ratios of nlo to the lo cross sections ( @xmath88-factors ) , which increase from relatively small values of 0.5 ( 0.6 ) in the infrared - sensitive region close to the @xmath89 cuts to unity at larger @xmath77 for the nd ( sd ) cross sections , indicating good perturbative stability and no sensitivity to the cut on @xmath79 there .",
    "the nd @xmath90-distribution @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , is plotted in fig .  2 ( left ) , again for the two    same as fig .  1 ,",
    "but for the normalized average rapidity distributions ( color online).,title=\"fig : \" ] same as fig .  1 , but for the normalized average rapidity distributions ( color online).,title=\"fig : \" ]    @xmath79 cuts , and the sd @xmath90-distribution in fig .  2 ( right ) . for nd and sd ,",
    "the two choices for the @xmath79 have little influence on the result .",
    "the cross sections are somewhat smaller ( by about 20% ) at the maximum as compared to the nd experimental data , again given without experimental errors , but are in agreement with the sd data .",
    "the theoretical diffractive @xmath90-distribution is boosted towards positive @xmath90 , as is the experimental one .",
    "we conclude from these comparisons that there is satisfactory agreement between the measured @xmath77 and @xmath93 distributions and our theoretical predictions based on the h1 2006 fit b dpdf .",
    "this motivates us to move on to the calculation of the ratio @xmath66 of sd to nd cross sections . actually ,",
    "if the experimental cross sections above had been known to us in the unnormalized form , we would have been in the position to deduce suppression factors as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath90 .",
    "the ratio @xmath66 of the sd to nd cross sections is evaluated as a function of @xmath40 , the fraction of the momentum of the antiproton transferred to the struck parton .",
    "it is calculated from the @xmath94 and @xmath95 of the jets with the relation in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , where the sum over @xmath96 is taken over the two leading jets plus the next highest @xmath3 jet with @xmath97 gev .",
    "the cross section in the numerator is integrated over @xmath11 in the range @xmath98 and over @xmath99 in the range @xmath46 gev@xmath45 and over the @xmath17 of the highest and second highest @xmath17 with @xmath100 gev for both the sd and nd jet sample .",
    "as already mentioned , the data samples have the constraint @xmath101 gev .",
    "we have checked that the choice @xmath82 gev for the nd and sd cross sections has negligible influence on @xmath66 .",

    "all three are calculated in nlo .",

    "we also show the scale error and the lo prediction .",

    "the result for this ( double ) ratio @xmath107 is seen in fig .",
    "3 ( right ) .",

    "the variation is strongest for the fit a dpdf , where this ratio varies by more than a factor of seven . for the other two dpdfs",
    "this variation is somewhat less , but still appreciable .",
    "actually , we would expect that the ratio plotted in fig .",

    "a comparison of the h1 data @xcite , which are used to obtain the dpdfs applied in our calculation , with a similar measurement , in which the leading proton is directly detected @xcite , yields a ratio of cross sections for @xmath170 gev and @xmath171 of @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "since the cdf measurements are performed by triggering on the leading antiproton , these measurements must be multiplied by this ratio to normalize them to the @xmath61 gev constraint for the h1 dpdfs .",
    "therefore , all suppression factors obtained so far must be multiplied by this ratio .",
    "any model calculation of the suppression factor , which is also sometimes called the rapidity gap survival factor , must try to explain two points , first the amount of suppression , which is @xmath169 at @xmath120 , and second its dependence on the variable @xmath28 ( or @xmath40 ) .",
    "such a calculation has been performed by kaidalov et al .",
    "@xcite . in this calculation , which we call kkmr , the hard scattering cross section for the diffractive production of dijets was supplemented by screening or absorptive corrections on the basis of eikonal corrections in impact parameter ( @xmath173 ) space .",
    "the parameters of the eikonal were obtained from a two - channel description of high - energy inelastic diffraction .",
    "the exponentiation of the eikonal stands for the exchange of multi - pomeron contributions , which violate regge and qcd factorization and modify the predictions based on single pomeron and/or regge exchange .",
    "the obtained suppression factor @xmath174 is not universal , but depends on the details of the hard subprocess as well as on the kinematic configurations .",
    "the first important observation in the kkmr analysis is that in the tevatron dijet analysis the mass squared of the produced dijet system @xmath175 as well as @xmath11 are almost constant , so that small @xmath28 implies large @xmath176 .",
    "the second important ingredient in the kkmr model is the assumption that the absorption cross section of the valence and the sea components , where the latter includes the gluon , of the incoming proton are different , in particular , that the valence and sea components correspond to smaller and larger absorption . for large @xmath176 or small @xmath28",
    ", the valence quark contribution dominates , which produces smaller absorptive cross sections as compared to the sea quark and gluon contributions , which dominate at small @xmath176 . hence the survival probability ( or suppression factor )",
    "increases as @xmath176 increases and @xmath28 decreases . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the convolution of the old h1 dpdfs @xcite and the @xmath28-dependent absorption corrections produced a @xmath177-distribution corrected for the soft rescattering , which was in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental distribution in the cdf publication @xcite ( see fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we have no doubt that using our single - diffractive nlo cross sections based on the more recent dpdfs of h1 @xcite will lead to a very similar result .    an alternative model for the calculation of the suppression factor",
    "was developed by gotsman et al .",
    "however , these authors did not convolve their suppression mechanism with the hard scattering cross section .",
    "therefore a direct comparison to the cdf data is not possible .    at variance with the above discussion of diffractive dijet production in hadron - hadron scattering , the survival probability in diffractive dijet photoproduction",
    "was found to be larger ( @xmath178 for global suppression , @xmath179 for resolved photon suppression only ) and fairly independent of @xmath28 ( or @xmath180 ) @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the hera analyses are restricted to large values of @xmath181 ( as opposed to small and intermediate values of @xmath182 ... @xmath183 ) , where direct photons or their fluctuations into perturbative or vector meson - like valence quarks dominate .",
    "the larger suppression factor in photoproduction corresponds also to the smaller center - of - mass energy available at hera .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed the first next - to - leading order calculation of single - diffractive and non - diffractive cross sections for dijet production in proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron , using recently obtained parton densities in the ( anti-)proton from global fits and in the pomeron from inclusive deep - inelastic scattering and dis dijet production at hera .",
    "the normalized distributions in the average transverse energy and rapidity of the two jets agreed well with those measured by the cdf collaboration at two different center - of - mass energies of @xmath33 and 630 gev .",
    "however , the ratios of single - diffractive and non - diffractive cross sections had two be multiplied by factors of about 0.05 and up to 0.3 , depending on the momentum fraction of the parton in the antiproton , the center - of - mass energy , the order of the calculation , and the dpdf .",
    "assuming regge factorization , the ratios of cross sections were interpreted as ratios of effective diffractive structure functions , exhibiting similar suppression factors .",
    "we found that the ratios of sd over nd @xmath88-factors of 1.35 and 1.6 at @xmath143 and 630 gev , respectively , were partially compensated by the simplification inherent in the definition of the effective structure functions , but that the suppression factors were still smaller at nlo than at lo .",
    "they were also less dependent on the momentum fraction of the parton in the pomeron at nlo than at lo , in particular at the lower center - of - mass energy and to a smaller extent also for the more restricted kinematics at the higher @xmath147 .",
    "the dpdf fit by the h1 collaboration using dis dijet data to better constrain the gluon density in the pomeron showed the most constant behavior .",
    "we pointed out that all suppression factors obtained so far must be corrected by a factor of @xmath172 due to the fact that the dpdfs were obtained from h1 data that includes diffractive dissociation , while the cdf data were triggered on a leading antiproton .",
    "we also recalled that the remaining momentum - fraction dependence can be explained by a two - channel eikonal model that predicts different behaviors for the regions dominated by valence quarks and sea quarks and gluons in the proton .",
    "this is in contrast to the constant behavior observed in photoproduction , which is governed by direct photon or valence - like quark contributions .",
    "we finally confirmed that the single - diffractive data are dominated by a single pomeron exchange , since its momentum fraction dependence in the antiproton is well described in shape by the pomeron flux factors fitted to the h1 dis data .",
    "an additional reggeon exchange would add only two to eight percent to the single - diffractive cross section for smaller and larger values of the reggeon momentum fraction .",

    "<S> in contrast to the observations for photoproduction , the suppression factor in proton - antiproton collisions depends on the momentum fraction of the parton in the pomeron even at next - to - leading order .    </S>",
