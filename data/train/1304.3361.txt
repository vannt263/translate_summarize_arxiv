    "for several decades , low dimensional magnetism has attracted great interest in solid state physics and chemistry .",
    "since the influence of quantum fluctuations becomes especially pronounced for low dimensional spin-1/2 systems , these systems have been investigated extensively , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "quantum fluctuations become even more important in determining the ground state and the nature of the low lying excitations if the system under consideration exhibits strongly frustrated interactions .    whereas pure geometrical frustration , i.e triangular , kagom or pyrochlore lattices , can be realized by special symmetries in two or more dimensions , frustration in one - dimensional systems ( linear chains )",
    "is generally realized by competing interactions .",
    "the simplest frustrated one dimensional model is the @xmath3-@xmath4 model with nearest neighbor ( nn ) exchange @xmath3 and next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) exchange @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is antiferromagnetic .",
    "the phase diagram of this seemingly simple model is very rich .",
    "depending on the frustration ratio @xmath10 , a variety of ground states are observed in corresponding quasi-1d systems : ( i ) ferromagnetically ordered chains in li@xmath11cuo@xmath11 @xcite ( @xmath12 ) ; ( ii ) helical order with different pitch angles in livcuo@xmath13 , licu@xmath11o@xmath11 , and nacu@xmath11o@xmath11 @xcite ( @xmath14 ) ; ( iii ) spin - peierls transition in cugeo@xmath15 @xcite ( @xmath16 ) , i.e.  both exchange couplings are antiferromagnetic .    the possibility of subtle interplay between spin , orbital , charge and lattice degrees of freedom due to the threefold orbital degeneracy of ti@xmath17 in octahedral environments , makes titanium 3 + based oxides an interesting class of materials to study .",
    "exotic features like orbital - liquid state in latio@xmath18 and presence of strong orbital fluctuations in ytio@xmath18 have been reported.@xcite while an abundance of experimental work exists on low dimensional spin-1/2 cuprates ( with cu@xmath19 ) , materials based on spin-1/2 titanates ( with ti@xmath17 ) are rather sparse .",
    "a well known example of low - dimensional titanates is the new class of inorganic spin - peierls materials tio@xmath20 ( @xmath20 = cl , br).@xcite quasi one - dimensional magnetism was observed in tiocl and tiobr along with a first - order transition to a dimerized non - magnetic ground state ( spin - peierls like ) below 67 k and 27 k , respectively .",
    "the main difference between s=1/2 titanates and vanadates as compared to the cuprates ( 3@xmath21 vs. 3@xmath22 ) is that the unpaired electron resides in the @xmath23 complex for the former , while occupying the @xmath24 complex for the latter .",
    "this usually results in narrow bands at the fermi level ( e@xmath25 ) for the titanates and vanadates as compared to the cuprates , which in turn leads to small values for the exchange couplings and brings several experimental conveniences . since the temperature scale for the magnetic contribution to the specific heat is of the order of @xmath26 , separating magnetic and phonon contribution in the specific heat ( @xmath27 ) measurements is thus relatively easy .",
    "for the same reason , magnetization measurements can reach the saturation moment in experimentally attainable fields , thereby providing more information about the exchange parameters and the frustration regime .",
    "thus , in many respects , spin 1/2 compounds with a singly occupied @xmath23 orbital are an ideal object to study the physics of quasi one - dimensional frustrated chains .",
    "kti(so@xmath0)@xmath28h@xmath2o , a new member in the family of titanium alums has recently been synthesized@xcite .",
    "the titanium ions are in the 3 + ( d@xmath29 ) oxidation state in this material .",
    "specific heat and susceptibility measurements indicate that kti(so@xmath0)@xmath28h@xmath2o is a s=1/2 frustrated chain system",
    ". fits to the susceptibility data using exact diagonalization on up to 18 spins resulted in estimates for leading exchanges @xmath7 = 9.46  k and @xmath8 = 2.8  k , both afm with @xmath5 = 0.29 . in the well",
    "studied @xmath7-@xmath8 frustrated chain model with both interactions being afm , the model undergoes a quantum phase transition at @xmath5 = 0.2411 to a two - fold degenerate gapped phase , and for @xmath30 0.2411 the system will exhibit spontaneous dimerization.@xcite in light of this result , kti(so@xmath0)@xmath28h@xmath2o would be expected to occupy the highly interesting region of the phase diagram , with a small gap @xmath31/20.@xcite    here , we report the results of an electronic structure analysis from first principles , carried out to obtain a microscopic picture of the origin of the low dimensional magnetism in kti(so@xmath0)@xmath28h@xmath2o . the magnetically active orbital is identified using band structure calculations followed by subsequent analysis of the exchange couplings .",
    "the calculated @xmath26 s have the same sign as the experiments ( @xmath32 afm ) , but the estimated frustration ratio @xmath5 is considerably larger compared to the experimental findings .",
    "we explore in detail the reasons for this discrepancy and propose an alternative solution that fits the experimental data , as well as being consistent with our band structure calculations . to this end , we have simulated the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility using the transfer - matrix renormalization group ( tmrg ) method to unambiguously identify the exchange couplings that describe the microscopic magnetic model for kti(so@xmath0)@xmath1h@xmath2o .",
    "on the basis of these results , we suggest performing high - field magnetization measurements , which will be a decisive experiment to identify the precise frustration ratio @xmath5 .",
    "the influence of crystal water on the observed ground state is also discussed in detail .",
    "the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows : the crystal structure of kti(so@xmath0)@xmath1h@xmath2o is described in section ii .",
    "the details of the various calculational methods are collected in section iii .",

    "v we demonstrate the effects of the crystal water in this compound by calculating the wannier functions . the outcome of the tmrg simulations is compared to the previous experiment in section vi , which is followed by a discussion and summary in section vii .",
    "throughout our calculations , we have used the recently determined experimental@xcite lattice parameters in the monoclinic space group ( @xmath33 ) of kti(so@xmath0)@xmath1h@xmath2o : @xmath34  =  7.649   , @xmath35  =  5.258   , @xmath36  =  9.049    and @xmath37  =  101.742@xmath38 .",

    "the single chains are displaced with respect to each other both laterally and vertically .",
    "large k@xmath40 ions isolate the double chains along @xmath34 , while along @xmath36 the chains are separated by water molecules that share the oxygen atom with the tio@xmath39 octahedra .",
    "the water molecules are oriented in the @xmath41 plane .",
    "all of the octahedral o - ti - o bond angles deviate slightly away from 90@xmath38 and there are three pairs of ti - o bond lengths of 2.001   , 2.056     ( in the @xmath42 plane ) and 2.043     ( along @xmath36 ) .",

    "consequently , the @xmath23 orbitals in tiocl were thought to split into a lower energy @xmath48 and higher energy @xmath49 orbitals .",
    "electronic structure calculations confirmed this interpretation and revealed the magnetically active orbital for the s=1/2 chains in tiocl was indeed the lower energy @xmath48 orbital,@xcite though a prolonged discussion of possible orbital fluctuations ensued afterwards . therefore , an analysis of kti(so@xmath0)@xmath1h@xmath2o from the structural point of view alone is not sufficient to determine the ground state of the system .",
    "detailed calculations are necessary to understand the correct orbital and magnetic ground state of the system .",
    "the dft calculations were performed using a full potential nonorthogonal local orbital code ( ` fplo ` ) within the local ( spin ) density approximation ( l(s)da ) @xcite .",
    "the energies were converged on a dense @xmath50 mesh with 300 points for the conventional cell in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "the perdew and wang flavor@xciteof the exchange correlation potential was chosen for the scalar relativistic calculations . the strong on - site coulomb repulsion of the ti 3@xmath51 orbital was taken into account using the l(s)da+@xmath52 method , applying the `` atomic limit '' double counting term .",
    "the projector on the correlated orbitals was defined such that the trace of the occupation number matrices represent the 3@xmath51 gross occupation .",
    "the afm parts of the exchange couplings are computed as @xmath53 , by mapping the results of the lda calculations on to a tight binding model ( tbm ) which is then mapped on to a hubbard model , and subsequently to a heisenberg model because the system belongs to the strong correlation limit @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 ( @xmath56 is the leading transfer integral at half filling ) . the full exchange couplings are obtained by mapping the lsda+@xmath57 total energies of various supercells with collinear spin configurations to a classical heisenberg model . the supercells used to calculate @xmath46 and @xmath47 were sampled using 300 and 100 @xmath50 points , respectively .",
    "maximally localized wannier functions ( wf ) were calculated for the ti @xmath23 orbitals , also using ` fplo `  @xcite , to obtain a visual insight of the relevant orbitals and superexchange paths .",
    "the magnetic excitation spectrum of frustrated spin chains was simulated using exact diagonalization code from the alps package.@xcite we used periodic boundary conditions and considered finite lattices comprising up to @xmath58 spins .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of infinite frustrated spin chains was simulated using the transfer - matrix renormalization group ( tmrg ) technique.@xcite for each simulation , we kept 120160 states , the starting inverse temperature was set to 0.05@xmath3 , and the trotter number was varied between 4@xmath5910@xmath60 and 16@xmath5910@xmath60 .",
    "the results were well converged for the whole temperature range of the experimental curve from ref .  .",
    "since there exists no previous report on the electronic structure of kti(so@xmath0)@xmath1h@xmath2o , we begin by analyzing the results from a non - magentic lda calculation . in a simplified , fully ionic model each ti@xmath17 ion is surrounded by a slightly distorted octahedron of o@xmath61 ions .",
    "the pseudo octahedral coordination dictates a set of local axes for the conventional @xmath24 and @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "the local coordinate system is chosen as @xmath62 , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 axes are rotated by 45@xmath38 around @xmath36 with respect to the original @xmath34 and @xmath35 axes .",
    "the non - magnetic total and orbital resolved density of states ( dos ) are collected in fig .  [ dos ] .",
    "the presented part of the valence band is predominantly comprised of ti 3@xmath51 and o 2@xmath65 states belonging to tio@xmath39 octahedra . the states belonging to sulfur ( not shown ) lie below -8 ev and are therefore well separated from the tio@xmath39 states . the weight close to the fermi level ( e@xmath25 ) is mainly from the ti @xmath23 states which contain two electrons ( one for each ti in the unit cell ) and are separated by a ligand field splitting of about 2  ev from the higher lying ( empty ) @xmath24 states . for an octahedral arrangement of oxygen anions around a 3@xmath51 transition metal cation ,",
    "a 2  ev ligand field split is rather typical . for kti(so@xmath0)@xmath1h@xmath2o ,",
    "the band width of the @xmath23 band complex is only 0.65  ev , about one third of the value for tiocl ( @xmath662  ev)@xcite .",
    "this difference arises from the fact that in tiocl , the basic octahedral structural units ticl@xmath2o@xmath0 are arranged such that they are corner - sharing in the @xmath34-direction and edge - sharing along the @xmath35-direction , leading to a larger interaction between the octahedral units and hence a larger @xmath23 band width .",
    "in contrast , the tio@xmath39 octahedral units in kti(so@xmath0)@xmath1h@xmath2o are neither corner- nor edge - sharing and hence the smaller @xmath23 band width .",
    "the degeneracy between the @xmath23 orbitals is lifted due to the monoclinic symmetry of the crystal structure as seen in the non - magnetic band structure ( fig .",
    "[ bands ] ) .",
    "there are 2 ti atoms per formula unit and therefore 6 @xmath23 bands close to e@xmath25 .",
    "the bands are highly dispersive along @xmath67-y , x - m and xz - mz directions , which are along the crystallographic @xmath68-axis and remain rather flat along the other high symmetry directions .",
    "this implies that the main interaction between the ti@xmath17 ions is along the `` double chain '' , while sizably smaller interactions are expected between the adjacent double chains .",
    "the band belonging to the @xmath69 orbital is lower in energy as compared to the @xmath70 and @xmath69 ( nearly empty and larger band width ) orbitals ( also see fig .  [ dos ] ) .",
    "the mixing between the ti 3@xmath51 and the o 2@xmath65 states close to e@xmath25 is less than 10% and similar to other systems where ti occurs in the @xmath71 configuration .",
    "this scenario is different from the cuprates ( d@xmath72 ) where 30% of the contribution to the states at e@xmath25 stems from o 2@xmath65 .",
    "this fundamental difference in the strength of the hybridization between the transition metal ions and the oxygen ligands comes from the relative energies ( @xmath73 ) of the oxygen @xmath65 and the transition metal @xmath51 bands . in cuprates ,",
    "the highest ( half - filled ) @xmath74 orbital and the uppermost ( filled ) oxygen @xmath65-orbitals are rather close in energy ( @xmath75 2  ev ) resulting in a strong @xmath76 hybridization . in titanates , on the contrary , the @xmath23 orbitals lie much higher in energy than the uppermost ( filled ) oxygen @xmath65-orbitals ( @xmath77 3  ev ) and therefore exhibit significantly less @xmath76 hybridization . upon hole doping",
    ", the holes would formally appear in the oxygen @xmath65-orbitals for cuprates and in one of the @xmath23 orbitals for titanates , characterizing them as charge - transfer and mott - hubbard systems , respectively .",
    "experimentally , kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o is an insulator , but a metallic solution is obtained within lda .",
    "such metallic results from lda are well known and understood to arise from the inadequate treatment of the strong coulomb correlation of the 3@xmath51 orbitals .",
    "therefore , the orbital dependence of the coulomb and exchange interactions are taken into account in a mean field like approximation using the lsda+@xmath52 approach ( section iv - c ) . as mentioned previously in sec .",
    "ii , the distorted octahedra in tiocl split the @xmath23 states into a lower lying singlet ( @xmath48 ) and a higher energy doublet ( @xmath49 ) . presuming no further symmetry breaking , adding correlations , the choice of the orbital for occupying the one unpaired electron of the ti@xmath17 ion in tiocl is rather straightforward : the singlet @xmath48 . on the other hand , for kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o the pseudo octahedral ligand field",
    "splits the @xmath23 states and removes the three fold degeneracy .",
    "nevertheless , due to the relatively small energy differences , there is no clear candidate for the choice of the half - filled orbital .",
    "the band center of the @xmath69 orbital is around e@xmath25 and is the lowest lying band of the @xmath23 complex .",
    "the center of gravity of @xmath70 and the comparably broad @xmath48 band are only slightly higher in energy than the @xmath69 at 0.15 ev and 0.25 ev , respectively .",
    "since the three @xmath23 orbitals are quite close in energy , a subtle balance between the orbitals is expected and therefore one should carefully consider the possibility of an orbitally ordered solution . at this juncture ,",
    "it is rather unclear which correlated orbital will be half filled and thereby determine the magnetic model .",
    "even the undoped , low dimensional s=1/2 cuprates that possess an extensive literature , where the magnetic model is generally understood to be governed by the half - filled @xmath74 orbital , can sometimes show surprises . for example , the cuo@xmath39 octahedral environment in the insulating s=1/2 quasi 1d system cusb@xmath2o@xmath39 is less distorted than usual , so that the cubic degeneracy for the @xmath24 ligand - field states are only slightly lifted .",
    "the energy difference between the @xmath74 and @xmath79 related band centers is about 0.3 ev only , compared with about 2 ev for standard cuprates .",
    "inclusion of correlations , changes the order and results in the unpaired electron occupying the @xmath79 orbital instead of the standard @xmath74 in cusb@xmath2o@xmath39.@xcite    we take into account the strong electronic correlations of the ti 3@xmath51 states via two possible ways : ( a ) mapping the results from lda first to a tight - binding model ( tbm ) , which in turn is mapped onto a hubbard model , and subsequently to a heisenberg model . at half filling , when @xmath52 is much larger than the bandwidth @xmath80 , the spin degrees of freedom are well described by an s=1/2 afm heisenberg hamiltonian with an exchange interaction @xmath81 .",

    "the difference between the two parameters used to incorporate the effects of strong correlations , @xmath54 and @xmath57 must be clarified .",
    "the former is applied to lda bands which include the effects of hybridization between the metal atoms and ligands , while the latter is applied to purely atomic @xmath51-orbitals and therefore necessitates using different values for these two parameters .",

    "as mentioned previously , the strong coulomb correlations favor full polarization and a detailed analysis is necessary to identify the ground state for the fully polarized @xmath51-orbital .",

    "[ str ] ) . by fitting ( using exact diagonalization ) the low temperature magnetic susceptibility",
    ", the recent experimental report@xcite suggests that the af - nn interaction @xmath7 is larger than the af - nnn interaction @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , one expects to observe large tails at oxygen sites from the wf s bending towards the nn ti atoms , as this facilitates the ti - o - o - ti superexchange .",
    "the ti @xmath48 wf is composed of contributions from the @xmath48 orbital as well as tails on the oxygen sites in the @xmath115-plane , although these do not point towards the nn ti atom .",
    "the @xmath70 wf , on the otehr hand , has tails on all 6 oxygen sites of the tio@xmath39 octahedra , and all point towards the nn ti atom .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath69 wf not only has tails on the oxygen sites bending towards the nn ti , but also has tails on one of the hydrogen site belonging to the crystal water molecule .",
    "such an effect is arising from the hybridization effect of the o and h orbitals .",
    "the effects of hybridization involving the h - atom in the @xmath70 wf is comparatively less than the @xmath69 , since no extended tails are observed on the h site .",
    "we therefore infer that the orientation of the water molecule plays an important role in deciding the magnetically active orbital for obtaining the ground state in kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o .",
    "more detailed analysis follows in the next section .",
    "it is normally assumed that the presence of crystal water in a compound , leads to only modest changes in the crystal field of the magnetic ion .",
    "however , it might not always be the case .",
    "recent work @xcite on cucl@xmath2 and cucl@xmath12h@xmath2o shows that the former is a quasi 1d - chain compound while the latter is a classical 3d afm , although the magnetic cu - cl units in both compounds are structurally similar . motivated by such reports and the results from our wf analysis , we explore the effects of the orientation of the h@xmath2o molecule in kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o .",
    "crystallographic data that we have used until now orient the h@xmath2o molecule in the @xmath116 plane . from the analysis of the wf s",
    "we infer that the magnetically active orbital ( @xmath69 ) is selected by the hydrogen bonding of the water molecule in the @xmath116-plane with the ti @xmath69 orbital .",
    "we now attempt to rotate the h@xmath2o molecule to the @xmath117 plane and observe the effects on the electronic structure .",
    "the symmetry of the crystal was reduced to accommodate the new orientation , though the experimental o - h distance ( 0.8747  ) as well as the h - o - h bond angle ( 93.33@xmath38 ) were left untouched .",
    "the resulting non - magnetic lda band structure is displayed in fig .",
    "the general shape of the bands as well as the various @xmath50 - point degeneracies are similar for both the @xmath116 and @xmath117 oriented h@xmath2o molecule .",
    "the important changes for the fictitious @xmath117 oriented system are : ( a ) the @xmath69 band is no longer having the lowest band energy and is getting pushed upwards and therefore less occupied , ( b ) the @xmath70 band is pulled downwards and is getting more occupied . ergo , the orientation of the h@xmath2o molecule has a profound effect on the electronic structure and plays an important role in selecting the magnetically active orbital .",
    "in contrast with the lda result , the addition of correlations results in @xmath69 as the lowest energy band , as was the case for h@xmath2o || @xmath116 .",
    "that said , the energy difference between singly occupied @xmath69 and @xmath70 is only 35 mev , 10 times smaller than the original calculation ( cf .",
    "iv - c ) in which the h@xmath2o molecule was oriented along the @xmath116-plane . calculating the @xmath26 s for the fictitious system using the effective tbm resulted in @xmath111 = 0.36 and a much larger @xmath107 = 1.11 .",
    "these results reaffirm the the importance of the water molecule in deciding not only the magnetically active orbital , but also the accordingly derived exchanges and frustration ratio in kti(so@xmath0)@xmath59h@xmath2o .",
    "having observed the sensitivity of the electronic structure to the orientation of the h@xmath2o molecule , our next item of interest was to check the importance of the o - h bond length on the electronic structure and magnetic properties .",
    "recent reports on spin-1/2 kagome lattice systems @xcite show a dramatic impact of the o - h bond length on the exchange .",
    "it is well known that obtaining the correct o - h bond length via x - ray diffraction in a system containing heavy atoms is difficult .",
    "oh@xmath118 impurity in oxides have been shown to have an equilibrium bond length of @xmath105 1  .@xcite for kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o , the reported o - h bond length is 10% smaller and only 0.874   .",
    "one possible reason for the larger frustration ratio @xmath5 in lsda+@xmath57 calculations as compared to experiments might arise from the possibly underestimated o - h bond length.@xcite we have therefore allowed the o - h bond length to relax . keeping the tio@xmath39 octahedra rigid , we relaxed the h position with respect to the total energy and obtained an optimized o - h bond length of about 1   , in accordance with the empirical expectations.@xcite recalculating the exchange constants using the optimized o - h distance",
    ", we obtain for @xmath119 = 4.0  ev , @xmath120 = 10  k , @xmath121 = 14.2  k. the frustration ratio @xmath107 = 1.4 is even larger than the previously calculated value using the experimental o - h bond length .",
    "thus far , all of our calculations have resulted in exchanges that have the correct sign and comparable magnitudes to the previous experimental report , but nonetheless always yielded frustration ratios far greater than previously reported.@xcite . in the following section ,",
    "we make a final attempt to clarify the discrepancy between the experiment and our calculations .",
    "as demonstrated in ref .  , a frustrated heisenberg chain model with @xmath122 can reproduce the experimental magnetic susceptibility curve of kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o .",
    "the small @xmath122 implies that @xmath3 is large , while @xmath4 is small .",
    "this is at odds with our lsda+@xmath119 calculations , where the antiferromagnetic exchange between nnn ti atoms appears to be more efficient than the nn exchange .",
    "thus , in the microscopic model , @xmath5 should be larger than unity .",
    "the question is then , whether the large @xmath5 regime conforms to the experimental behavior .",
    "the small energy scale of the leading couplings leads to sizable error bars for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 values estimated from lsda+@xmath119 calculations . to refine the model parameters",
    ", we use the analytical expressions for the high - temperature part of the magnetic susceptibility of a frustrated heisenberg chain , the high - temperature series expansion ( htse).@xcite typical for a local optimization procedure , the results are dependent on the initial values . if we start from the @xmath123 limit , htse yields @xmath124 k and @xmath125 k , very close to the @xmath122 reported in ref .  .",
    "in contrast , if we proceed from the @xmath126 regime , we obtain @xmath127 k and @xmath128 k ( @xmath5 = 1.5 ) , in accord with our lsda+@xmath119 calculations .",
    "thus , htse yields two ambiguous solutions",
    ".    htse typically diverges at temperatures comparable with the magnetic energy scale ( @xmath129 ) . to verify , whether both solutions agree with the experimental @xmath130 at lower temperatures",
    ", we simulate the temperature dependence of reduced magnetic susceptibility @xmath131 using tmrg , and fit the resulting @xmath132 dependencies to the experimental curve . in this way",
    ", we again find that besides the previously reported @xmath133 solution , the @xmath5=1.5 curve with @xmath3=5.4k , @xmath4=8.1k , @xmath134=1.74 , and @xmath135emu / mol also yields an excellent fit to the experimental magnetic susceptibility ( fig .  [ f - chi ] ) .",
    "the difference curves evidence that both @xmath5=0.29 and @xmath5=1.5 provide equally good description of the experimental @xmath130 data ( fig .",
    "[ f - chi ] , inset ) .",
    "the coexistence of the two solutions actually manifests the inner symmetry of the frustrated chain model . a trivial example : the uniform chain limit can be described with @xmath136 ( @xmath137 , @xmath138 ) as well as @xmath139 ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) .",
    "the @xmath5=0.29 and @xmath5=1.5 solutions are also related , although in a less trivial way . to pinpoint this relation , we revisit the phase diagram of the frustrated chain model .",
    "the @xmath142 limit corresponds to the exactly solvable gapless heisenberg chain model .",
    "this gs is robust against small frustrating @xmath4 , up to the quantum critical point @xmath143 , where a spin gap opens.@xcite for larger @xmath5 values , the spin gap rapidly increases and reaches its maximum value @xmath144@xmath3 at @xmath145 .",
    "further enhancement of @xmath5 reduces the spin gap . in the large @xmath5 limit ( @xmath146 )",
    ", the spin gap exhibits an exponential decay.@xcite    thus , for a certain value of the spin gap @xmath73 , there are two possible @xmath5 values : ( i ) with a dominant @xmath3 , i.e.  from the @xmath5=0.24110.6 range , and ( ii ) with a sizable @xmath4 ( @xmath5=0.6@xmath147 ) . since @xmath73 plays a decisive role for the shape of @xmath130 , both solutions yield similar macroscopic magnetic behavior .",
    "this explains the seemingly unusual fact that the experimental data for kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o can be fitted by both @xmath122 and @xmath148 .    despite the similar spin gaps , the solutions @xmath5=0.29 and @xmath5=1.5 are physically different ( unlike , e.g. @xmath5=0 and @xmath5=@xmath147 , that describe the same physics ) : spiral correlations are present in the latter case , only.@xcite moreover , the two solutions feature substantially different correlation lengths.@xcite thus , the two solutions can be distinguished by measuring a characteristic experimental feature ( `` smoking gun '' ) .    for spin systems ,",
    "a measurement of magnetization isotherms is technically simple , but very informative , especially for systems with weak magnetic couplings .",
    "since the magnetic field linearly couples to the @xmath149 component of the spin , a magnetization curve reflects the energy of the lowest lying state in each @xmath149 sector .",
    "this often suffices to distinguish between ambiguous solutions .",
    "for instance , htse for the @xmath150 square lattice system bacdvo(po@xmath13)@xmath11 yielded , besides the frustrated solution with an afm @xmath4 , also a nonfrustrated solution with afm @xmath4 .",
    "however , the frustrated scenario was clearly underpinned by @xmath151 measurements.@xcite in a recent work , @xmath151 measurements for @xmath152cup@xmath11o@xmath153 ( @xmath154=li , na ) resolved previous controversies concerning the magnetic dimensionality of these compounds.@xcite    we argue that for the frustrated heisenberg chain model , the characteristic behavior of magnetization on the verge of saturation can be used to distinguish between different scenarios .",
    "in particular , the @xmath122 magnetization curve exhibits a well pronounced upward bending , while only a feeble bending is visible in the @xmath155 gs magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ f - mh ] ) .",
    "another relevant quantity is the saturation field : @xmath156,\\ ] ] where @xmath157 corresponds to the fully polarized state .",
    "the energies are estimated using exact diagonalization for finite chains of @xmath158=32 spins .",
    "adopting @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath134 values from the htse fits , we obtain @xmath159 t and @xmath160 t for @xmath122 and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "both values of saturation field lie in the experimentally accessible field range .",
    "a somewhat problematic point could be the low energy scale of kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o , which renders the typical measurement temperature of @xmath661.5k as relatively high , hence the states with different @xmath149 could be substantially mixed . still , the @xmath122 magnetization isotherms will retain fingerprints of the characteristic bending .",
    "therefore , we believe that a high - field ( up to @xmath6620 t ) measurement of a magnetization isotherm will be an instructive and decisive experiment to distinguish between the @xmath122 and @xmath148 scenarios .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the electronic structure of kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o in detail using dft based calculations .",
    "the results of both the tbm and lsda+@xmath57 calculations confirm beyond doubt the low dimensional nature of the material with nn and nnn exchanges @xmath7 and @xmath8 confined to the double - chains running along the @xmath35-axis .",
    "we also confirm the afm nature of the exchanges , consistent with the experimental report , with the ti-3@xmath69 orbital being the magnetically active one , holding the single unpaired electron of the ti@xmath17 ion .",
    "the magnitude of the calculated @xmath26 s are of the right order compared to the experiment , though we observe a strong dependence to the @xmath23 orbital choice . notwithstanding the small energy scale ( @xmath105 10 k ) of the system , we are able to obtain accurate results from our dft calculations . additionally , we observe a surprisingly large spin - lattice coupling with respect to the crystal water related degrees of freedom , which in turn manifests itself by playing an important role in determining the ground state of the system .",
    "this feature is clearly elucidated by calculating the wannier functions , which show the effects of hydrogen bonding to the corresponding @xmath23 orbital which is oriented in the same plane as the crystal water molecule . using the experimental position for hydrogen",
    ", we obtain a frustration ratio @xmath161 1.0 and a value of @xmath161 1.4 upon relaxing the hydrogen position in the crystal lattice .",
    "both these values are larger than the experimental value @xmath162 = 0.29 . in order to understand the origin of this discrepancy between the experiment and our calculations",
    ", we simulated the temperature dependence of the susceptibility using both the small and large values of @xmath5 . due to an intrinsic symmetry of the @xmath163 frustrated chain model ,",
    "we show that both values of @xmath5 provide equally good fits to the experimental curve .",
    "consequently , we calculated magnetization curves as a means to unambiguously distinguish the two solutions and show two features which can be used to identify the appropriate @xmath5 that defines the magnetic ground state of kti(so@xmath78h@xmath2o .",
    "hence , we suggest performing high - field magnetization measurements on this system and as well as a.c . susceptibility experiments ( to obtain the size of the spin - gap ) at very low temperatures .      w.  e.  a.  lorenz , r.  o.  kuzian , s .- l .",
