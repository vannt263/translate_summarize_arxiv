    "glass is a fascinating disordered solid , it is mechanically rigid , like a solid , but has a liquid like structure . when crystallization is avoided by a fast quench , the relaxation time of the supercooled liquid increases dramatically by approaching a critical point for many systems @xcite , which is usually called the glass transition point .",
    "hard sphere system is a simple model system to exhibit the glass transition by increasing density , which has been studied extensively in theory @xcite .",
    "experimentally it can be realized using colloidal particles @xcite or granular materials @xcite .",
    "however , the dramatic increase of the relaxation time is poorly understood .",
    "the relaxation time near the glass transition is too high to measure either in simulations or experiments .",
    "there are a few functional forms @xcite proposed to fit the available data on relaxation time as a function of density .",
    "the fitting functions are formulated such that from its extrapolation to higher densities relaxation time diverges at the glass transition .",
    "this implies that relaxation is impossible at the glass transition point . + a series of attempts @xcite exist in the literature to understand the transport properties near the glass transition from the free volume theory .",
    "the theory gives a relation between diffusivity and the structural variable free volume .",
    "here , we establish a relation between the structural relaxation time and the free volume .",
    "we define a cage such that the free volume of a particle is the cage volume .",
    "the connection between the average cage volume to the structural relaxation time concludes that the relaxation time is too high when the free volume is zero .",
    "this point of zero free volume and very high relaxation time represents here the glass transition point .",
    "then , the relation between the free volume and the density questions the existence of the glass transition in hard sphere systems . + the structural relaxation of a supercooled liquid exhibits particle caging which is absent in the normal liquid .",
    "the rearrangement of a cage of a particle is known to happen by hopping of the particle to a new cage is seen by exhibiting a jump in the squared displacement of the particle .",
    "the rearrangements of cages have been studied both in the experiments @xcite and in the computer simulations @xcite where the information of cages are extracted from a dynamical quantity .",
    "a cage of a particle here is made up with its neighbours specific to enclose its free volume surface .",
    "we show that the cage rearrangements indeed happen when the squared particle displacements exhibit jump . in the same time",
    "there are some cases where the rearrangements happen with almost no change in the particle displacements .",
    "+ a couple of complex scenarios @xcite exist in the relaxation process near the glass transition . at a given time , the particles which have escaped the cage , can be thought as fast moving particles .",
    "there are particles at the same time which did not escape the cage and have small displacements .",
    "hence , there is a coexistence of slow and fast moving particles in space @xcite , known as dynamic heterogeneity . the fast moving particles cluster in space ,",
    "specifically form a string - like cluster @xcite . a recent work @xcite has claimed that the string like clusters are the cooperative rearranging region where more than one particle rearranges cooperatively .",
    "we ensure here that our picture of cage rearrangements also supports these complex scenarios of the relaxation process .",

    "the binary mixture is considered to avoid crystallization .",
    "the starting configuration is prepared by performing the conjugate gradient minimization of randomly initialized configuration with the repulsive harmonic potential @xmath3 for @xmath4 , and zero otherwise .",

    "an easy example is that a particle with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 dimension ) contacts has zero free volume , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap](a ) .",
    "the properties of free volume has been explored for equilibrium liquids extensively @xcite .",
    "a previous work has shown that the free volume of a hard sphere is mostly aspherical @xcite , hence the cage defined here is not necessarily spherical .",
    "note here the cage size is not dependending on a cutoff .",
    "the cage volume is the free volume of a particle .",
    "the relaxation mechanism here will focus on the rearrangement of neighbours of a cage .",

    "the relaxation time @xmath27 and the average cage volume @xmath40 are calculated for a given density and plotted against each other for densities @xmath41 in fig .   [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "we find that the relaxation time and @xmath40 have a well defined relation @xmath42 , such that @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "if we look at the variation of the average cage volume @xmath40 as a function of packing fraction @xmath45 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we find that it has value around @xmath46 .",
    "hence , @xmath47 can be considered as zero .",
    "if we assume at the glass transition density @xmath48 , the relaxation time is as high as @xmath49 , such that the relaxation by simulation is not accessible . then at @xmath50 average free volume @xmath51 is zero .",

    "we tag the neighbours at @xmath56 and find out @xmath57 which is the number of survived neighbours out of tagged neighbours @xmath55 at a given time @xmath21 .",
    "the variation of @xmath58 with time describes the rearrangement of cage neighbours around a particle .",
    "we plot @xmath59 in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) as a function of time in the same panel as the self - intermediate scattering function .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 also exhibits three distinct regimes at higher densities similar as @xmath20 , even the late time behaviour can be fit to the stretched exponential as seen clearly in the figure by being parallel to the corresponding @xmath20 @xmath22-relaxation regime .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) shows that the plateau amplitude of the fraction @xmath37 increases with increasing the density .",
    "so , longer the caging time , higher is @xmath59 which indicates the cage surrounded by higher fraction of initial neighbours take longer time to escape the cage .",
    "the higher value of @xmath37 at plateau by increasing the density means that the cage there is more tightly packed when a particle escapes from it .",
    "intuitively the probability of relaxation by hopping process is high if the cage during the process of escaping is tightly packed .",
    "this implies that mostly particles relax by escaping the cages following jumps at higher densities .",
    "+     is shown below each panel .",
    "we observe @xmath60 behaves according to the displacement , _",
    "i.e. _ when it drops suddenly , it is due to the jump in the squared displacement .",
    "again the backward jump increases the value of @xmath58 as seen in the panel(c ) .",
    "only panel ( d ) shows a particle which has no change in the displacement , but there is a drop from the average value @xmath61 to @xmath62 in @xmath60.,width=216 ]    a line at @xmath36 parallel to the @xmath63-axis is drawn for a given density which intersects the plot of @xmath37 at a point @xmath38 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "the @xmath63-value of @xmath38 will tell us how many neighbours of time @xmath56 a particle looses in order to relax .",
    "surprisingly , the value @xmath64 _ i.e. _ @xmath65 is not constant with the packing fraction @xmath45 , it decreases with increasing packing fraction .",
    "higher the density , higher is the @xmath59 at the plateau but interestingly lower is @xmath66 .",
    "if the relaxation takes place by hopping , then the fraction @xmath58 after relaxation will be smaller than any other way of relaxations .",
    "having lower @xmath66 at higher densities supports our anticipation that particles at higher densities relax mostly by hopping process . as the jump in particle squared displacement",
    "is interpreted as hopping , clearly at higher densities the displacement of the particle should be tightly correlated with the particle cage rearrangement @xmath58 . +      to investigate further the squared displacements of individual particles are considered .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows four cases of squared particle displacements during the time of observation :",
    "( a ) a particle is caged , ( b ) a particle escapes the cage following a single jump , ( c ) a particle escapes the cage following successive jumps , and ( d ) another case of a caged particle . for case(a ) we observe that there is no neighbour rearrangement in the time of observation .",
    "the case(b ) has neighbour rearrangement by dropping @xmath58 to an average value @xmath67 exactly at same time where the jump is observed .",

    "afterwards the particle has a backward jump and at last another forward jump , the corresponding @xmath60 behaves consistently with this . for case(d ) interestingly the particle did not displace much to escape the cage , but there is neighbour rearrangement .",

    "[ fig : fig3](c ) that successive jumps can give @xmath82 , and should have very high squared displacement .",
    "now particles sitting in three regimes are picked up and plot the corresponding distribution @xmath78 in the same panel fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a , b ) . particles with @xmath82 are indeed those which have higher displacements so they are multiple times ` hoppers ' .",
    "` hoppers ' are those which have the squared displacement larger than the value of @xmath84 of first minima , @xmath85 .",
    "+ firstly the particles falling into the regime of ( b ) contributes to the peak at large displacement , and of regime ( c ) has only one peak at small displacement .",
    "this observation confirms that the particles which exhibit jumps(either one or multiple ) in the single particle squared displacement , also exhibits at same time sudden drop in @xmath58 , _",
    "i.e. _ the neighbours rearrangement of particles is tightly bound to the squared particle displacements .",
    "so , along with dynamical heterogeneity there is spatial heterogeneity of local structural rearrangement",
    ". moreover , the number of rearranged particles decreases with increasing density , but the number of ` hoppers ' exhibiting multiple jumps@xmath86 increases by increasing density .",
    "this means that ` hoppers ' with successive jumps are the ones to relax the system at further densities .",
    "interestingly the case of ( b ) where particles have relaxed or rearranged , also have a displacement peak even below @xmath85 , is supporting the scenario of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](d ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that there are some ` slow ' particles surrounded by ` hoppers ' .",
    "this result indicates that not necessarily a particle has to move out of the cage in order to relax .",
    "if there are a few ` hoppers ' , they assist as well their neighbours to rearrange , so there are particles more than number of ` hoppers ' which have relaxed in time @xmath21 . at time",
    "@xmath36 , some of all particles with @xmath87 are ` hoppers ' and some are ` slow ' particles .",
    "so , the possibility of being dynamical heterogeneous at @xmath36 can not be ignored specially at those higher densities where @xmath37 is small .",
    "next fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](c , d ) shows that the ` hoppers ' are mainly particles small in size , and the big particles rearrange due to small neighbours around them .",

    "the inset shows that the ratio between @xmath88 and @xmath89.,width=192 ]      it has been shown that fast and slow moving particles cluster in space @xcite , the work in @xcite shows that fast moving particles have strong radial distribution peaks compared to the radial distribtution function of bulk particles .",

    "the ratio @xmath90 increases with increasing density shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] inset .",
    "the cooperative rearrangement is stronger at higher densities .",
    "one can define the cluster of ` r ' particles as cooperatively rearranging region ` crr ' .",

    "we assume that at the critical density @xmath97 , @xmath98 , then the fitting the data(fig .  [ fig : fig6](b ) ) with @xmath99 inspired from the mode - coupling prediction gives @xmath96 and @xmath95 .",
    "the value of @xmath32 is close to the packing fraction obtained from the fitting of the relaxation time @xmath27 as a function of packing fraction @xmath45 , which supports our assumption .",
    "as discussed before @xmath98 represents multiple jumps in the squared particle displacement , then at @xmath32 mostly ` hoppers ' have multiple jumps .",
    "+ now , we mark the mean squared displacement @xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) . surprisingly , this quantity increases with increasing density shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](a ) and we show the data can be fit with the function @xmath101 where @xmath93 and @xmath92 , again almost the same density as obtained from the fit to the relaxation time .",
    "this implies that @xmath100 diverges at @xmath97 .",
    "the possible explanation is that the ` hoppers ' exhibiting successive jumps are strongly correlated in space , such that the cluster of ` hoppers ' is most probably ` string ' like and it has an infinite length .",
    "the same argument has been given before @xcite by calculating the string length formed by fast moving particles as a function of temperature for the lennard - jones system .",
    "+ in conclusion a single particle picture presented here can explain most of the existing findings of the relaxation process upto the mode coupling critical temperature .",
    "the picture with more than one particle may be required to describe the system above the density @xmath13 and can be extended in future .",
