    "the harmonic - oscillator potential for relativistic spin 1/2 particles has received considerable attention by many groups .",
    "the subject is of broad interest since the relativistic harmonic oscillator plays a role in several areas , namely , in nuclear and particle physics . in particular , it is the central potential of the nuclear shell model , and it has also been used as the binding ( and confining ) two - body potential for quarks , with applications in meson and baryon spectroscopy .",
    "a special type of harmonic - oscillator potential is achieved by replacing the linear momentum operator @xmath8 in the dirac equation by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the usual dirac matrix .",
    "this replacement results in a second order differential equation for the upper and lower components of the dirac spinor containing a quadratic potential in the radial coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "besides the quadratic potential , that second order differential equation contains a constant spin - orbit term , meaning that , in the nonrelativistic limit , in which only the upper component survives , the degeneracy of the energy levels is different from the one found in the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator . as explained in the following section , that potential may arise from a lorentz tensor interaction in spinor space . in ref .",

    "dirac oscillator _ and renewed to a great extent the interest in the topic .",
    "the dirac oscillator has been applied to quark confinement and supersymmetry @xcite and hadron spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "its group symmetries have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , its solutions in @xmath11 dimensions and coupling to magnetic field were worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and finally its wave packets and thermodynamical properties in @xmath12 dimensions were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another possibility to introduce a harmonic potential in the dirac equation is by mixing vector and scalar harmonic potentials with equal magnitude and sign , aiming at obtaining a quadratic potential in the schrdinger - like second order differential equation for each spinor component @xcite .",

    "more recently , there has been a wide interest in relativistic potentials involving mixtures of vector and scalar potentials with opposite signs .",

    "we shall consider a dirac hamiltonian that generalizes the previous ones by simultaneously introducing radial quadratic potentials for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and a linear radial potential for @xmath2 , the tensor potential defined in the following section .",
    "we will study the cases with @xmath18 and @xmath6 , for which analytical bound solutions do exist , including also , as particular cases , the kukulin potential and the original dirac oscillator . the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions are obtained analytically in the general case .",
    "next we shall analyze particular cases and pay a special attention to the nonrelativistic limits and to the case @xmath19 , for which pseudospin symmetry is exact and there are still bound states , as opposed to what happens with nuclear mean fields . from our analysis",
    "we also show that the case @xmath7 is a more natural way to introduce a harmonic oscillator in the dirac equation than the usual way with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the eigenenergies have the usual degeneracy of the nonrelativistic case and the upper component a form similar to the nonrelativistic wave function .",
    "actually , by letting the harmonic - oscillator frequency to become small compared with the mass , we obtain exactly the eigenvalues and wave functions of the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "we also present the node structure of the radial wave functions , motivated by a study carried on in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1 and @xmath0 radial potentials vanishing as @xmath22 . in order to find reasons for the unusual radial node structures in some particular cases ,",

    "the structure of the radial nodes for the dirac spinor has also been presented and compared to the case when the potentials vanish for large distances .",
    "we discussed in detail the case of the harmonic oscillator with @xmath19 for which pseudospin symmetry is exact , i.e. , pseudospin doublets ( states with same @xmath162 ) are degenerate . in this case we can have bound states due to the positive harmonic - oscillator potential @xmath16 .",
    "these states can be regarded as intrinsically relativistic , in the sense that the @xmath16 potential has no analog in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "in fact , they show a very peculiar structure of radial nodes in comparison to the nonrelativistic harmonic - oscillator radial wave function : the states with @xmath350 have at least one node @xmath351 in the upper component and can have zero nodes only in the lower one . as a consequence",
    ", the intruder levels on the nuclear spectra ( isolated levels with @xmath352 and @xmath353 ) do not exist in the harmonic oscillator in the limit of nuclear pseudospin symmetry @xmath354 . in this limit",
    "the states with zero nodes in the upper component have @xmath355 .",
    "moreover , the relativistic harmonic oscillator in the case @xmath19 has a much higher energy degeneracy than the approximate pseudospin symmetry seen in the nuclear spectra ( doublets with same @xmath356 ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the meson exchange theory of nuclear forces produces nuclear potentials that vanish when @xmath357 , a completely different asymptotic behavior from the harmonic - oscillator potential discussed here .",
    "one possible way to break this extra degeneracy of the harmonic oscillator is to add a woods - saxon - like potential as it has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another important conclusion from our work is that a dirac equation with scalar and vector harmonic - oscillator potentials with the same sign and magnitude ( @xmath18 ) , instead of the linear tensor potential @xmath2 , is the most natural way to introduce the harmonic oscillator in relativistic quantum mechanics , since one gets the correct nonrelativistic limit , so that the energy levels and the upper component of the wave functions are very similar to the non - relativistic ones .    finally , our analysis of the relativistic harmonic oscillator shows , in a very simple and analytical way , that the nuclear pseudospin symmetry @xmath358 does not have a nonrelativistic limit , in the sense that the eigenvalues are of second order in a @xmath359 expansion .",
    "so we conclude that the relativistic harmonic oscillator is an excellent example to show explicitly what ginocchio had already emphasized in his pioneering work : the pseudospin symmetry in the dirac hamiltonian ( when @xmath360 ) is indeed a symmetry of relativistic nature .    0.5",
