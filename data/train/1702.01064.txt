    "properties of confined systems have been studied extensively , primarily _ at thermodynamic equilibrium_. in this setting , the possible emergence of collective behaviours , with the associated universality and scaling laws , allows the introduction of simplified minimal models which form the basis of theoretical descriptions applicable to a large class of physical systems , belonging to the same so - called universality class .",

    "some of them have been investigated for film geometries , where time - dependent linear response and correlation functions were studied for a fluctuating medium with purely dissipative dynamics ( the so - called model a @xcite ) in refs .",

    "we study the viscosity of a confined , correlated fluctuating medium , such as a fluid , via linear response theory . in order to highlight the relevant effects of correlated fluctuations , we focus on a simple dynamical model , which is a modified version of the so - called dynamical model h @xcite for binary liquid mixtures .",

    "while the resulting stress and viscosity from this model are cutoff - dependent , i.e. , they depend on microscopic parameters of the fluid , their dependence on the correlation length @xmath4 is to some extent universal .",
