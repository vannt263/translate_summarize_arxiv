    "the qcd sum rules @xcite is one of the most powerful tools in studying the low energy hadron physics on the basis of qcd . in this method ,",
    "physical observables of hadrons are related with qcd vacuum via a few condensates . in the literature ,",
    "a new , widely discussed alternative to traditional sum rules , namely light cone qcd sum rules ( lcqsr ) is a convenient tool for the study of exclusive processes which involve the emission of a light particle .",
    "the lcqsr is based on the operator product expansion on the light cone , which is an expansion over the twist of the operators rather then the dimensions as the traditional qcd sum rules . in this method",
    "all the non perturbative dynamics encoded in the so called wave functions , which represents as the matrix element of the nonlocal operators between vacuum and the corresponding hadron ( more about this method can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the promising ways for obtaining information about wave functions is experimental study of form factors .",
    "the pion electromagnetic form factor was calculated in the framework of lcqsr in @xcite .",
    "recently the electromagnetic form factors of pion and kaon is analyzed in @xcite taking into account the effects of higher twist contributions and the @xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "the aim of this work is the calculation of the electromagnetic form factor of the @xmath0 meson taking into account twist @xmath2 and twist @xmath3 wave functions of the @xmath0 meson as well as the @xmath1 symmetry breaking effects , i.e. the mass of the strange quark and the different value of the strange quark condensate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 , we derive the sum rules for the electromagnetic form factor of the @xmath0 meson which is then analyzed numerically in section 3",
    ". summary of our results and conclusions are presented at the end of sect .",
    "in this section we calculate the e.m . form factor of the @xmath0 meson employing lcqsr . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider the following correlation function : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the @xmath0 meson interpolating current and @xmath6 is the electromagnetic current .    here , we would like to remark that in this work we will follow the usual parametrization of the @xmath7 mixing in octet - singlet basis and due to the smallness of the mixing angles ( see e.g. @xcite ) , they will be neglected .",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) , it is seen that there are four different structures that can be used to extract the form factor . in this work",
    "we will concentrate only on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 structures .",
    "hence one can write @xmath13 where @xmath14 stand for the remaining structures and @xmath15 where @xmath16 . for the invariant amplitudes @xmath17 , one can write a general dispersion relation in @xmath18 in the form : @xmath19 where the spectral functions corresponding to eq .",
