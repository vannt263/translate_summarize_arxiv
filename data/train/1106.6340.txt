    "we have found that for a fixed value of the dilaton coupling parameter @xmath84 , the possibility of obtaining a static stable solution increases as far as the exponent @xmath149 in the equation of state grows , i.e. as the generalized chaplygin gas gets closer to the ordinary one ( with @xmath164 ) .",
    "the same result was previously found for reissner ",
    "nordstrm thin  shell wormholes ( which correspond to @xmath86 ) in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand , as the dilaton coupling @xmath84 increases ,",
    "the values of the parameters for which stable static solutions exist lie in a smaller range , so the dilaton field reduces the presence of stable configurations .",
