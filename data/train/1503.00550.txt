    "the non - abelian nature of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  the theory of strong interaction  gives rise to the expectation that its gauge bosons , the gluons , form composite objects denoted as glueballs @xcite .",
    "these states would have access to various quantum numbers @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the total spin , @xmath2 the parity and @xmath3 the charge conjugation ; the corresponding spectrum in the qcd yang - mills sector has been determined in numerical simulations @xcite but the identification of glueballs in experimental data has proven to be a challenge , particularly in the @xmath4 ( scalar ) channel . +   + there are at least two reasons to study glueball states .",
    "firstly , their masses are generated solely by the strong interaction ; no influence of the higgs mechanism  providing , e.g. , quarks with a current mass  is present in the glueball mass generation .",
    "secondly , due to their structure glueballs must possess integer spin assigning them to mesons ; our understanding of the physical meson spectrum would not be complete without glueballs",
    ". +   + glueball ground state is scalar @xcite ; listings of the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite contain five isospin - zero scalar states in the energy region below 1 gev : @xmath5 or @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "while all of them possess the quantum numbers of the ground state , there are strong reasons to focus on resonances above 1 gev as candidates for the scalar glueball : ( @xmath11 ) simulations in lattice qcd determine the ground - state mass at between approximately 1.65 gev and 1.8 gev @xcite ; ( @xmath12 ) various effective approaches to low - energy qcd arrive at an analogous result for the mass while describing the overall dynamics correctly @xcite .",
    "complication is that @xmath13 resonances will most certainly have contributions not only from the ( pure ) glueball states but also from those containing quarks ( @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite and others ) .",
    "this leads to various issues in both theory and experiment @xcite and represents the main reason why the scalar glueball has still not been clearly identified .",
    "+   + in this article , the question of the scalar glueball is tackled by a holographic approach to non - perturbative qcd .",
    "such approaches are based on the idea of a duality between strongly coupled quantum gauge field theories and weakly coupled supergravity / superstring theories in one dimension higher , pursuing maldacena s groundbreaking conjecture of a complete equivalence between the supergravity limit of type - iib string theory on an @xmath16 space and the large-@xmath17 limit of an @xmath18 @xmath19 supersymmetric and conformal @xmath20 gauge theory on its boundary ( ads / cft correspondence @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , witten proposed an analogous duality in type - iia string theory , with supersymmetry and conformality not present in line with their absence in qcd .",
    "the supersymmetry is broken by compactification on a circle ( @xmath21 ) ; for a vanishing circle radius , the 5-dimensional pure yang - mills theory is reduced to a 4-dimensional one .",
    "however , the supergravity approximation requires finite circle radius ( whose inverse is defined as the kaluza - klein mass @xmath22 ) , and also a large coupling .",
    "thus constructed holographic approaches are referred to as _ top - down _",
    "models @xcite ; there are also more phenomenological _ bottom - up _ constructions ",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "this articles describes the implications of the top - down witten - sakai - sugimoto model @xcite for the glueball spectroscopy ; more details can be found in ref .",
    "while witten s model contained only gauge fields , the novel feature of witten - sakai - sugimoto model is the inclusion of chiral quarks introduced by @xmath23 ( number of flavours ) probe d8 and anti - d8 branes [ inducing @xmath24 chiral symmetry ] that extend along all dimensions of the 10-dimensional space with the exception of a ( kaluza - klein ) circle .",
    "the branes are usually antipodally separated with regard to this @xmath21 . the space geometry , however , is such that the branes and antibranes merge at a certain point  interpreted as realisation of the chiral - symmetry breaking .",
    "+   + up to a chern - simons term , the corresponding action for d8-branes reads    @xmath25    where @xmath26 ( and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the string coupling ) , @xmath29 is the metric of the d - brane world volume , @xmath30 is the dilaton field and @xmath31 a field strength tensor whose components are , upon dimensional reduction , identified as meson fields of interest .",
    "no backreaction of the witten - model background to d8-branes is considered ; consequently @xmath23 is fixed and , as can be argued @xcite , significantly smaller than the number of colours ( large-@xmath32 limit ) .",
    "+   + the above action is expanded up to the second order in fields as @xmath33\\ ] ] where @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath35 is the t hooft coupling ( and @xmath36 the 4-dimensional coupling ) , @xmath37 is the holographic radial coordinate ( and @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 is the flat metric diag@xmath40 . the kaluza - klein mass @xmath22 sets the model scale ; beside the scale , the model contains only one unknown quantity : the coupling @xmath41 .",
    "they are usually determined such that the mass of the rho meson and the pion decay constant correspond to their physical values .",
    "this yields @xmath42 mev and @xmath43 ; alternative methods for their determination do not alter model conclusions @xcite .",
    "+   + once @xmath22 and @xmath41 are known , the model describes various experimental quantities surprisingly well @xcite .",
    "glueballs are of interest in this article ; building on the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the following masses in the scalar channel are obtained : @xmath44 two types of glueball states are present : one , denoted with @xmath45 , is predominantly dilaton while the other , denoted with @xmath46 , involves a graviton polarisation in a fourth spatial dimension , unlike the dilaton , and has therefore been termed _ exotic _",
    "excited states are denoted with an asterisk .",
    "we observe that the exotic ground state is approximately 50% lighter than the expectation from lattice qcd ; the dilaton mode mass is only approximately 15% smaller than the lattice result .",
    "numerical simulations also indicate the mass of the first excited scalar state to be @xmath47 2600 mev with errors amounting to @xmath47 300 mev @xcite ( although mass corrections in the unquenched case may be substantial @xcite ) ; the excited dilaton state is within errors consistent with the lattice result while the excited exotic mode is approximately 15% too light .",
    "hence already from the mass results the indication is that the exotic mode could be discarded while the dilaton mode appears compatible with simulations of the yang - mills sector of qcd .",
    "+   + this is corroborated by the decay ratios of the modes .",
    "the corresponding lagrangians are obtained by inserting 10-dimensional metric fluctuations ( whose explicit forms together with further details are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) into the action for d8 branes and integrating over the bulk coordinates ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; ratios of decay widths @xmath48 and the respective masses @xmath49 read @xmath50 the two main candidates for the scalar glueball are the @xmath9 and @xmath10 resonances ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "experimental data imply @xmath51 @xcite and @xmath52 ",
    "@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the exotic mode is thus too broad , again indicating that its interpretation as a physical state is uncertain ; contrarily , the ratio @xmath54 for the dilaton mode is within the experimental interval for @xmath10 . +",
    "similar is true for the excited states : @xmath55 is larger than @xmath56 and nicely comparable to widths of @xmath13 states near and above 2 gev ; however , the full decay width of @xmath57 having contributions from @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and other channels is unphysically large ( @xmath61 1 gev , see ref .",
    "contrarily , @xmath56 is small but the full decay width of @xmath62 is of the order of 460 mev @xcite and thus significantly closer to the data @xcite whose current uncertainties unfortunately do not allow for a clear identification of an excited scalar glueball .",
    "in this article , a top - down holographic approach to low - energy qcd  witten - sakai - sugimoto model  has been presented and its implications for phenomenology of scalar glueballs have been discussed .",
    "the model offers two sets of glueball states , a dilaton and an _ exotic _",
    "mode that , unlike the dilaton , involves a graviton polarisation in a fourth spatial dimension .",
    "the exotic ground state has a mass approximately 50% smaller than the value expected in lattice qcd ; its @xmath63 decay width is substantially larger than that of the two prime candidates for the scalar glueball , the resonances @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "contrarily , the mass of the dilaton mode (= 1487 mev ) is quite close to masses of both mentioned resonances ; its @xmath63 decay width is within the experimental range for @xmath10 , which therefore appears to be the preferred candidate for the glueball ground state . in the excited channel ,",
    "the exotic state is unphysically broad while the dilaton width @xmath64 mev is close to the ( still ambiguous ) data on @xmath13 states near / above 2 gev .",
    "+ nonetheless , further pursuit of glueball dynamics in holography is called for , particularly in light of expectations from the planned panda experiments at fair @xcite .",
