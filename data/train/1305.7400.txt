    "such a time series will contain an enormous amount of features of great importance for the solar dynamo and the theory of magnetic flux emergence at the solar surface .",
    "a list of existing time series was compiled by lefevre & clette ( 2012 ) .",
    "data of individual spots have not been available for the period before the kodaikanal data starting in 1906 until the analyses of the staudacher drawings by arlt ( 2009 ) covering 17491799 and the zucconi drawings by cristo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) covering 17541760 .",
    "the first paper ( arlt 2011 , paper  i ) focused on the inventory and description of the digitization of the historical sunspot drawings by samuel heinrich schwabe made in the period of 18251867 .",
    "the majority of drawings were made with a high - quality fraunhofer refractor of 3.5  feet focal length .",
    "the full set of 8486  full - disk drawings has now been fully measured .",
    "the method of measurements will be described in section  2 while the resulting spot distribution and the possible sources of errors will be discussed in section  3 .",
    "the analysis aims at the full exploitation of the drawings by providing positional information of each individual sunspot together with its size .",
    "unfortunately , the greenwich data set and its continuation by the usaf / noaa only provides the average group positions and the total areas of the groups .",
    "information like the size distribution of sunspots and the tilt angles and polarity separations of bipolar regions are only preserved if the individual spots are stored in the data set , however .",
    "the schwabe data are also superior to the ones by carrington ( 18531861 ; cf .",
    "lepshokov et al .",
    "2012 for a recent analysis ) and sprer ( 18611894 ; recent analysis by diercke et al .",
    "2012 ) , which only report about sunspot groups at a certain instance when they were near the central meridian .",
    "the schwabe data contain the full evolution of sunspot groups crossing the visible solar disk .",
    "for all images possessing a horizontal reference line , we assumed that the line is parallel to the celestial equator ( cf .",
    "paper  i ) . the position angle and tip angle of the heliographic coordinate system",
    "is obtained from the jpl horizons ephemeris generator .",
    "we used the geographical coordinates of the observing location in the town of dessau , germany , and generated a list of these quantities in six - hour intervals for the entire period of 1825 to 1867 .",
    "the quantities for times in between two output lines were interpolated linearly .",
    "the documentation of the horizons ephemeris service states that the position angle is the `` target s north pole position angle ( ccw with respect to direction of true - of - date celestial north ) '' .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that schwabe used the local sky rotation to adjust his telescope to the north .",
    "he must thus have been arrived nearly at a `` true - of - date '' celestial north .",
    "the actual orientation of the solar - disk drawing comes from the cross - hairs used in the eyepiece .",
    "schwabe did not report on how he adjusted the eyepiece ( rotation may have easily been possible ) . throughout the vast majority of observations",
    "the alignment is amazingly consistent but , as we will see later , there are a few short periods when the eyepiece was apparently misaligned .    for all observing days with drawings ,",
    "the actual solar disk was extracted from the digitized image by four mouse clicks on the left , right , lower and upper limbs of the circle , where the middle of the pencil stroke width was chosen .",
    "this way , also slight ellipticities are allowed thereby , although only in the vertical or horizontal directions and not at an arbitrary angle .",
    "this turned out to be a reasonable choice , since ellipticities mainly come from the fact that the paper may not have been entirely flat when photographed , producing a prolateness of the circles .",
    "if a horizontal line is available in the image , two clicks near the left end and near the right end of the line define the position angle of the celestial equator in the image .",
    "again , the middle of the pencil stroke width was chosen visually .",
    "the position angle of the solar equator is then added to this orientation , and the actual heliographic grid is superimposed to the image",
    ".    in some cases , the main vertical line is not perpendicular to the horizontal one .",
    "we are applying a special transformation to the cartesian coordinates of the measurements , as described in subsect .",
    "[ skew ] below .",
    "the various tools for the measurements were written in the interactive data language ( idl ) .",
    "there is a set of 1168  drawings which do not show a coordinate system , mostly in the period of mid-1826 to 1830 .",
    "since there are often sequences of days for which the drawings have a number of sunspots in common , we can use the rotation of the sun to find the probable position angles of the heliographic coordinate systems .",
    "we assume the sidereal rotation profile obtained from average sunspot group positions by balthasar et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and use the numerical values @xmath0 for the angular velocity @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the heliographic latitude .",
    "we actually need the synodic rotation rate for our purposes which is obtained from solving kepler s equation for the eccentric anomaly of the earth at each instance it is needed , using an eccentricity of @xmath3 , and a rotation period of @xmath4 ( newcomb 1898 ) .",
    "note that the use of the solar rotation profile implies that we can not use the resulting sunspot positions directly for the determination of the differential rotation of the sun later on , since they are not independent of the rotation profile .",
    "a bayesian parameter estimation is employed to obtain the position angles and average sunspot positions .",
    "we start with looking at @xmath5 drawings and associating @xmath6 sunspots with each other , which are visible in all these drawings .",
    "given the two coordinates of each spot , these combinations deliver @xmath7 measurements .",
    "the unknowns are the heliographic coordinates of the spots , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 counts the spots , and the position angles @xmath11 of the drawings where @xmath12 counts the days .",
    "we are thus faced with @xmath13 free parameters . for three days with three common spots , we have @xmath14  measurements and @xmath15  unknowns , for example , while two days with two spots deliver only @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "note that there may be two or three days between two adjacent drawings in a sequence .",
    "formally , there is another parameter which we either have to determine beforehand or keep as a free parameter .",
    "it is the measurement error of schwabe s plots .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that these errors roughly form a gaussian distribution .",
    "deviations from gaussian distributions may only be expected for spots very near the solar limb , but for the majority of spots , gaussian will be a good approximation , and we assume that there is a single standard deviation @xmath18 describing the distribution . allowing @xmath18 to be a free parameter was considered , but turned out to be impractical since the model then obtains excessive freedom to assume that the spots are in the wrong place and yield very odd combinations of latitudes and position angles at high likelihood .",
    "the value of @xmath18 was thus estimated from a number of chains with high @xmath5 and high @xmath6 using the residuals .",
    "these should be identical to the plotting errors only for infinitely large @xmath5 and @xmath6 , an exactly known rotation profile and the assumption of zero proper motion of the spots . as a compromise we chose chains of five drawings having 24  spots in common and kept @xmath18 as a free parameter . from this set of 15  sample chains ( i.e. 75  drawings ) in 1827 and 1828",
    ", we obtained an a average @xmath19 of the solar disc radius .",
    "we used this value of @xmath18 in all actual determinations of position angles of drawings where no coordinate system was given by schwabe .",
    "note also the additional remarks about the accuracy in section  [ accuracy ] .",
    "bayesian inference is based on the distribution of probability density over the entire parameter space .",
    "( we will often use the term ` probability distribution ' , but actually the probability density is meant . )",
    "every combination of parameters , given the model differential rotation , is tested on its likelihood to have created the data .",
    "since this is too expensive computationally , we are employing monte - carlo markov chains which explore the parameter space very efficiently , without wasting computing time in regions of very low probability density but without being limited to local maxima either .",
    "the parameter space for the determination of orientations from one chain is binned into @xmath20 bins for which the number of passages of the markov chains is counted .",
    "after normalisation , these counts give the probability density distribution . the posterior distribution for a given individual parameter",
    "is obtained by marginalisation over all the other parameters .",
    "one often has several options of combining consecutive drawings into a chain that is analyzed by the bayesian estimator .",
    "it is of course not a matter of the residuals to tell which combination is best , since the residuals always improve when the number of free parameters approaches the number of measurements .",
    "we will denote the combinations by @xmath21 in the following .",
    "the suitability of combinations of drawings for the determination of the orientations is not easily quantified .",
    "the bayesian information criterion ( bic , also called schwartz criterion ) is one guess for the trade - off between keeping the residuals as well as the number of free parameters low .",
    "it does not , however , take into account the distribution of the spots over the solar disk which may vary from very suitable to almost degenerate .",
    "we computed a number of about twenty test cases to obtain an idea of good and bad distributions .",
    "based on the bic and on this experience , we start from the combination @xmath22 as the desired one and used a ranking for other combinations to be chosen when @xmath22 is not possible . the ranking with descending `` priority '' is the following : @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( turned out to be equal in suitability ) , @xmath25 .",
    "rare occasion with many common spots are not listed here , but the first three combinations indicate already , that it is better to use three drawings with few spots than a pair of drawings with many spots .",
    "since there is considerably more rotational displacement with three drawings , the third drawing fixes the spot positions very well and always produces highly plausible results .",
    "a subjective quality flag is given to the spots of a given day .",
    "all drawings with a pencil grid obtain a quality flag of @xmath26 .",
    "positions derived from the rotational matching of two or more consecutive drawings , may obtain @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or @xmath28 .",
    "our rules to assign the different quality flags are as follows : if the probability distribution of one of the free parameters has a full confidence interval of more than @xmath29 , but the distributions are not skewed , we assign a quality of @xmath30 .",
    "if the distributions are additionally slightly skewed so that the average parameter is different from the mode value by up to @xmath31 , we use @xmath32 . a subjective estimate of the quality is given with values from 1 ( highest quality ) to 3 ( lowest quality ) .",
    "drawings delivering very skewed or double - peaked distributions are discarded and the quality estimate is set to 4 ( see section  2.7 ) .",
    "we did not derive any sunspot positions for those days .",
    "we store the sunspots of discarded drawings and fill their positions with nan .",
    "yet their sizes are available and useful and are stored in the spot file along with group designations .",
    "it is of great advantage to know the full distribution of the probability density as compared to minimization procedures for , e.g. , @xmath33 .",
    "such searches are not aware of additional minima and may even miss the global minimum entirely .    , scaledwidth=48.0% ]      we used a set of circular mouse cursor shapes with different diameters to estimate the sizes and positions of the sunspots .",
    "for all spots showing a penumbra , only the umbral size was measured .",
    "this is because open circles were often drawn by schwabe to indicate the presence of penumbrae .",
    "while the umbrae pencil dates are clearly drawn with the intention to distinguish different sizes , the penumbrae show less carefulness since they are all of very similar size .",
    "additionally , schwabe s penumbrae show little foreshortening near the solar limb ( see group  68 in fig .",
    "[ penumbrae ] ) .",
    "we leave it to future scrutinization which may or may not show the scientific usefulness of the penumbral sizes drawn by schwabe .",
    "a total of 12  size steps of a circular cursor were used running from an area of 5  square - pixels to 364  square - pixels ( table[sizes ] ) including the borders .",
    "we always used the largest possible circular cursor for which the boundary of the circle was contained _ within _ the umbral area , if the umbra was circular .",
    "noncircular spots can only be approximately matched with these cursor masks , of course .",
    "note that the pencil dots have a certain minimum size which did not require the use of 1  square - pixel areas .",
    "the total area of the solar disk is 708822  pixels .",
    "a single square - pixel corresponds to 1.4  millionths of the disk .",
    "the smallest areas measured here are 7  millionths of the solar disk . an alternative way of estimating the areas was given by cristo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . in their work ,",
    "the umbral areas were derived for zucconi s observations in 17541760 in a semi - automatic black - pixel - finding algorithm which can deal with almost arbitrary sunspot shapes . because of the lower and varying contrast in schwabe s pencil drawings , this algorithm would be more difficult to apply in our case , and was not employed .    before 1831",

    "as already discussed in section  [ bayesian ] , the analyses of 75  drawings _ without _ reference lines delivered a plotting accuracy of 0.05 in units of the solar radius ( @xmath34 in the disk center ) .",
    "we might consider this an upper limit , since the absence of reference lines makes accurate plotting more difficult , but see below .",
    "the plotting accuracy certainly varied on a day - by - day scale , since poor weather may have allowed only little time for a drawing .",
    "this is supported by occasional comments by schwabe that the spot positions are only approximate because of clouds .    for the accuracy of the majority of drawings which do show a coordinate grid , we selected blindly a number of sequences of days during which simple spots of waldmeier class  h and  i were crossing the solar disk .",
    "we determine the deviations of the measured latitudes from the average latitude of such a spot . to avoid problems with the differential rotation",
    ", we only looked at the scatter in the heliographic latitudes and assume the true latitudes have not changed with time .",
    "the periods with the resulting standard deviations @xmath18 of the spots latitudes are given in table  [ sigmas ] .",

    "interestingly , this value is even a bit larger than the one obtained for the drawings without coordinate grids ( @xmath34 ) . note that proper motions in latitude are much smaller and extremely rarely exceed @xmath37d",

    "figure  [ butterfly ] shows the latitude  time distribution ( butterfly diagram ) of all sunspots measured in schwabe s drawings .",
    "the patterns formed by the four cycles observed do not show any peculiarities at first glance .",
    "the separation of the two hemispheres is less distinct than in the butterfly diagram of the rgo / usaf data set .",
    "this is mostly due to the larger positional errors in the schwabe data , and to a lesser extent due to the fact that the rgo / usaf data are average group positions while the schwabe data contain individual spots which introduce an additional intrinsic scatter to the plot .",
    "there were some periods in which the spot latitudes @xmath2 were very high , @xmath38 .",
    "these were in august 1836 , when spot latitudes exceeded @xmath39 , in 1839 , in the middle of cycle  8 , when latitudes exceeded @xmath40 , and in april 1854 when an individual spot was south of @xmath41 at the end of cycle  9 .",
    "when inspecting the apparent motion of the spots across the disk , we noticed that the coordinate system given in the drawings was not properly aligned .",
    "a total of 16  drawings have therefore been analysed using the rotational matching of section  [ bayesian ] .",
    "this method led to much lower latitudes for the first two periods mentioned .",
    "the matching of the last period in 1854 ( a single spot over seven days ) did not deliver sharp probability density distributions and was discarded .",
    "april  24 , 1854 with the exceptional latitude was removed from the data base .",
    "most of these problematic drawings were actually not made by schwabe , but by other persons .",
    "the butterfly diagram also shows unusual latitudes in june 1846 .",
    "inspection of the drawings shows , however , that the spot motion is consistent with the alignment of the drawings .",
    "we have not altered these measurements in the data base .",
    "how likely are extreme latitudes ?",
    "the rgo / usaf data contain minimum and maximum group latitudes of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , according to the data base as of 2013 april  1 .",
    "since these are average spot positions of a given group , the actual maximum and minimum latitudes of individual spots will be another few degrees towards the poles .",

    "the schwabe measurements delivered 46  cases with @xmath44 among about 135,000  lines of data , with extreme cases between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "there are relatively fewer high - latitude spots appearing in the rgo / usaf data than in schwabe s data , but the extrema are comparable .",
    "we provide a set of about 135,000  sunspot positions and sizes measured on drawings by samuel heinrich schwabe in the period of november 5 , 1825 to december 29 , 1867 .",
    "the data base can be obtained from the web site of the corresponding author .",
    "the accuracy of the sunspot positions appears to be between three and four degrees in the heliographic coordinate system near the disk center .",

    "the data also contain an estimate of the individual spot sizes .",
    "they are given in 12  classes and should not be linearly scaled to physical areas .",
    "the positions were obtained using ( i ) the coordinate system drawn by schwabe , if available , ( ii ) a rotational matching with adjacent days if no coordinate system is given , and ( iii ) an assumed alignment of the drawings with the horizontal system , if ( i ) and ( ii ) were not applicable , which was the case predominantly in the beginning of the observing period .",
