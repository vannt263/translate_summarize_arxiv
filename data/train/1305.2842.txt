    "low - scale supersymmetry has been recognized for some time as the most natural solution to the hierarchy problem . in addition , supersymmetry with r - parity imposed can provide a natural dark matter candidate in the form of the lightest supersymmetric partner ( lsp ) , which is typically the lightest neutralino  @xcite . moreover , extending the standard model ( sm ) to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) results in much - improved gauge coupling unification  @xcite .",
    "although the putative superpartners have yet to be observed , the recent discovery of a higgs boson with a mass near @xmath4  gev  @xcite is consistent with the upper bound on the higgs mass in the mssm , @xmath5  gev  @xcite .",
    "naively , one might have expected the superpartners to have already been found based upon naturalness arguments which imply that the masses of the superpartners should be tev - scale or lower .",
    "however direct searches from the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider are pushing the mass limits on squarks and gluons above the tev - scale  @xcite . furthermore , while the higgs mass is below the mssm upper bound , it is still somewhat larger than expected . in order to obtain such a large higgs mass in the mssm",
    "requires large radiative corrections from couplings to the top / stop quark sector , implying muli - tev scale squark masses , and/or large values of tan@xmath6 .",
    "contrary to naive expectations , it is known that it is possible for squarks and other scalars to have heavy multi - tev masses while still solving the hierarchy problem naturally , or at least by only introducing a small amount of fine - tuning .",
    "perhaps the best known such scenario is that of the hyperbolic brand / focus point ( hb / fp ) supersymmetry   @xcite .",
    "fp superpartner spectra usually feature heavy multi - tev scalars with lighter gauginos .",
    "the lightest neutralino in these spectra is typically of mixed bino - higgsino composition , while the gluino is typically the heaviest of the gauginos and can have a mass up to a few tev . in frameworks such as msugra / cmssm  @xcite ,",
    "focus point supersymmetry is realized in regions of the parameter space occur where the universal scalar mass @xmath2 is much larger than the universal gaugino mass , @xmath3 .",
    "it has been pointed out that although spectra which lie on the focus point can solve the hierarchy problem with low fine - tuning of the electroweak scale , this still requires a large amount of high - scale fine - tuning , at least within the context of msugra / cmssm where @xmath7 is unnatural as there is no _ a priori _ correlation of the high - scale parameters  @xcite .",
    "although msugra / cmssm provides a simple and general framework for studying the phenomenology of gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking , ultimately the supersymmetry breaking soft terms should be determined within a specific model which provides a complete description of physics at the planck scale , such as string theory .",
    "for example , in the context of type ii flux compactifications , soft terms of the form @xmath7 and @xmath8 may be induced by fluxes in type iib string theory with d@xmath9-branes  @xcite .",
    "soft terms of this form were studied in  @xcite where it was shown to lead to focus - point regions of the parameter space and where it is possible to obtain a @xmath4  gev higgs , satisfy the wmap9  @xcite and planck  @xcite results on the dark matter relic density as well as all standard experimental constraints while maintaining low electroweak fine - tuning .    in the following , the possible sets of universal supersymmetry breaking soft terms that may arise in an mssm constructed from intersecting / magnetized d - branes in type iia / type iib string theory will be analyzed .",
    "this model satisfies all global consistency conditions and has many attractive features which make it a suitable candidate for study .",

    "it will then be shown that there exist more general sets of universal soft terms in the model , where supersymmetry - breaking is also dominated by the dilaton .",
    "for these sets of soft terms , it will be shown that the universal scalar mass and trilinear coupling are fixed so that @xmath10 and @xmath8 , where @xmath11 is the gravitino mass .",
    "it will then be shown that universal soft terms where the universal scalar mass is much larger than the universal gaugino mass , @xmath7 , may be obtained .",
