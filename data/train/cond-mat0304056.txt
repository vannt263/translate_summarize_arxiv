    "the spin-1/2 ising model @xcite has been a remarkably succesful model of a short - range interacting system to study phase transitions in magnetic , order - disorder , ferroelectric systems , etc . in this model ,",
    "the spin variable @xmath8 is allowed to take values @xmath91 on each lattice site .",
    "the hamiltonian that rules the interaction between the spins has the following form    @xmath10    the phase transition of the system results as a consecuence of the cooperative behavior of the spins determined by the first term of this hamiltonian , where @xmath11 is the exchange energy .",
    "the second term contains the magnetic field @xmath12 , which also influences the ordering of the spins .",
    "the critical exponents of the ising universality class have been extensively investigated for a long time by various methods , high ( ht ) and low temperature ( lt ) expansions , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , field theoretical ( ft ) methods , etc .",
    "in particular , near the critical point @xmath13@xmath14@xmath15 and @xmath12@xmath140 , the susceptibility ( @xmath16 ) exponent ( @xmath17 = @xmath18log@xmath19/@xmath18log@xmath20@xmath21@xmath20 ) , the correlation length ( @xmath22 ) exponent ( @xmath23 = @xmath18log@xmath24/@xmath18log@xmath20@xmath21@xmath20 ) , the pair correlation function [ @xmath25 exponent @xmath26 ( where @xmath27@xmath28 ) , the specific heat exponent ( @xmath29 = @xmath18log@xmath30/@xmath18log@xmath20@xmath21@xmath20 ) , and the spontaneous magnetization exponent ( @xmath31 = @xmath18log@xmath32/@xmath18log@xmath20@xmath21@xmath20 ) have been repeatedly investigated by mc methods , but no direct mc investigations of the critical isotherm exponent ( @xmath7 = @xmath18log@xmath12/@xmath18log@xmath32 ) have been published , as far as we know .",
    "the determination of the critical exponent @xmath7 from monte carlo data at the critical isotherm , @xmath33 at @xmath34 , was made in such a way as to minimize ( 1 ) finite size effects , appearing only at @xmath12 very close to zero , and ( 2 ) saturation effects , appearing at the opposite end of the sets of data , i.e. at @xmath12 away from zero , when the power law @xmath32@xmath35@xmath36 loses its validity .",
    "relatively large lattices ( of the order of @xmath37 spins or more ) with periodic boundary conditions and very closely spaced field intervals ( @xmath38@xmath12@xmath350.0005 ) were used to approach the critical point .    in order to confirm the value of the critical temperature for each dimensionality ,",
    "@xmath39 was first determined by means of a wolff @xcite ( modified swendsen - wang @xcite ) algorithm .",
    "however , @xmath33 was studied with a standard metropolis @xcite algorithm which produces an excellent local and global thermalization of the whole lattice for one single temperature ( in our case always @xmath34 ) . in all cases ,",
    "100,000 monte carlo steps were used in order to insure good thermal equilibrium , and 20,000 states were considered in the partition function at each temperature / field .",
    "it is easy to understand that our metropolis algorithm , modified for studying the evolution of magnetization with magnetic field , is sufficient to investigate @xmath7 .",
    "when we make calculations modifying @xmath12 by very small amounts one would not expect too large changes in the fluctuations , making it unnecessary to use modified clusters algorithms , which get statistically more independent states for the evolution with temperature , as it is well known . in any case , the good quality of the results shown below , obtained with the metropolis algorithm , speak for themselves .",
    "the @xmath33 data allow the direct determination of @xmath1 from log - log plots of @xmath32 vs. @xmath12 at @xmath34 .",
    "the one - dimensional case is the easiest of all to be considered because the critical temperature is exactly zero ( there is no real phase transition ) . in figure 1 , we show that the smallest non - zero value of the magnetic field @xmath12 make the whole lattice turn in the same direction , perfectly ordered , keeping the magnetization at the maximum value ( @xmath32=1 ) all the way .",
    "in 1944 , onsager @xcite performed the calculation of the exact partition function of the two - dimensional ising model in zero field .",
    "however , the same problem in a magnetic field remain unsolved although we can study their behavior numerically . in figure 2",
    ", numerical monte carlo @xmath0 data allow the direct determination of @xmath3=0.0666(2 ) from log - log plots of @xmath32 vs. @xmath12 at @xmath13=@xmath15=2.269185314213 .",
    "the ising criticality for dimension @xmath40=3 has been studied using several theoretical approaches ( including mc simulations ) that have resulted in an ( almost complete ) set of safe estimates of the critical exponents .",
    "some exponents like @xmath17 or @xmath31 have received special attention and their best estimates have been summarized @xcite as @xmath41@xmath41.2372(5 ) and @xmath42@xmath40.3265(3 ) . however , in the case of the critical exponent @xmath43 , there is no direct mc measure of its value and the currently accepted estimate have been determined using the scaling relation @xmath17=@xmath31(@xmath7 - 1 ) resulting in a value of @xmath43=4.789(2 ) .    as it is shown if figure 3 , our monte carlo @xmath0 data allow the determination of @xmath5=0.1997(4 ) from log - log plots of @xmath32 vs. @xmath12 at the currently accepted value @xcite of the critical temperature @xmath13=@xmath15=4.511523785 .",
    "note that this direct value of the critical exponent @xmath43@xmath45 is appreciably different from the actual @xcite estimated value 4.789(2 ) .",
    "it is important to note at this point , that for dimensions @xmath40@xmath444 the exponents of the ising model become the same and take the corresponding mean - field values @xcite .",
    "these exponents suddenly lock into a set of values that become independent of the dimensionality .    in figure 4",
    ", our monte carlo @xmath0 data allow the determination of @xmath6=0.332(5 ) from log - log plots of @xmath32 vs. @xmath12 at the currently accepted value @xcite of the critical temperature @xmath13=@xmath15=6.68029(9 ) .",
    "it must be noted that finite size effects begin to be observable just at @xmath12@xmath450.001 for the particular lattice size used .",
