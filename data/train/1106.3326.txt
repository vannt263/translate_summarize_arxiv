    "five axis machine tools are well known in the industry for their high versatility and productivity by allowing the control of both position and orientation of the cutting tool relative to the workpiece . however , the higher number of axes results in more sources of errors , such as geometric link errors , which represent the relative location error between successive axes of a machine tool .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the uncertainty contributions on the identified errors when using a cartesian closed chain calibration approach and the capball sensing head .",

    "the three sensors have their axes nominally orthogonal and intersecting in one point called @xmath23 .",
    "the machine is programmed to keep the tool center point @xmath23 coincident with the center of the master ball called @xmath24 ( fig .  [",

    "those poses are chosen considering certain constraints :    * maximise the volume inscribed into the identification path to cover the largest part of the machine working envelop to identify more representative parameter estimates ; * provide a relatively good condition number for the identification jacobian to reach a better data noise immunity ; * provide a large number of scalar equations to identify the parameters with a good outlier points robustness .    the trajectory shown in fig .

    "fig : trajectory ] describes the 807 successive positions of the points @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the machine coordinate system .",

    "however , the sensing head measurement frame is not parallel to the machine tool frame .",
    "the capball allows the measurement of the cartesian volumetric errors in the sensing head frame . to be able to express @xmath8 in the machine tool frame",
    ", the orientation of the sensors axes must be calibrated .",

    "the two following homogeneous coordinate matrices can be built to model this process :    @xmath37    @xmath38    those two matrices can be theoretically related by a transform matrix @xmath39 to convert the sensors readings into master ball motion relative to the sensing head expressed in the machine frame :    @xmath40    then , the best transform matrix from sensors frame to machine frame considering a least square criterion is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the moore - penrose pseudo inverse of @xmath43 .    with this method ,",

    "the sensors are ordered so that @xmath44 is a right - handed reference frame . in an hypothetically perfect case , where the sensors directions would be exactly orthogonal , the gains perfectly known , the sensors response exactly linear and the machine movements perfect , then @xmath39 should be written as :    @xmath45    with the norm of each @xmath46 equal to 1 and all the @xmath46 forming together and orthogonal matrix .",
