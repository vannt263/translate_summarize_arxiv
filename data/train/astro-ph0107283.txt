    "the importance of gas flows in bars as a transfer mechanism of material toward the centers of galaxies , thus fuelling central activity ( certainly starburst and possibly agn - related ) and driving galaxy evolution is a well - established fact ( e.g.  combes , dupraz , & gerin 1990 and references therein , sakamoto et al .",
    "gas flowing along the bar loses angular momentum , resulting in a net infall that can be as large as several solar masses per year .",
    "stable , non - intersecting orbits for gas are required ; between corotation and the inner lindblad resonance(s ) ( ilrs ) the gas moves on elongated , bar - sustaining @xmath3-orbits .",
    "material may accumulate close to the ilr(s ) , a ` spray ' of gas may impact gas still on @xmath3-orbits , and characteristic , curved bar shocks , often accompanied by dust lanes , may develop .",
    "thus , it is easy to see how a _ diffuse , unbound _ gas component may form along the bar , by either tidal disruption of bound clouds or cloud collisons ( das & jog 1995 , httemeister et al .",
    "2000 ) . in time , as the bar evolves , the bulk of the gas is funneled from the outer @xmath3-orbits to an inner family of ( slightly anti - bar ) @xmath4-orbits ( e.g.  friedli & benz 1993 ) . strength , shape and existence of the bar shock depend on the central mass concentration ( see e.g.  simulations by athanassoula 1992 ) .",
    "when the gas approaches the central region , part of it may remain diffuse and unbound .",
    "however , it may also pile up and become dense enough to cause ( and then continue to feed ) a nuclear starburst .",
    "clearly , the gas properties within the bar and within the central starburst region should differ .",
    "the gas _ within _ the starburst center is also expected to consist of a number of different phases , e.g.  partly diffuse material flowing in from the bar , dense clouds that may represent both hot , actively star forming cores and a dense component that does not ( at the moment ) form stars and thus cools efficiently , gas exposed to strong shocks and  as the starburst evolves  a component that is strongly affected by the energy released by the young massive stars and thus disrupted .",
    "the balance of these phases will change with the state of the burst ; therefore the gas properties , if they can be derived accurately enough , can be used as an indicator of starburst evolution .    _ line intensity ratios _ , especially of the @xmath0co and @xmath1co isotopomers , which are sensitive to gas densities of a few 100@xmath5 , but also , if available , of high density tracers like hcn , hnc and cn , are powerful diagnostics of the physical properties of the gas they arise from .",
    "this requires observations that are still at the limit of what the current generation of mm - telescopes ( both single dish and interferometers ) can do , since it is essential to observe both higher @xmath6 transitions ( at least the 21 line ) and rare isotopomers .",
    "the data obtained are then analysed by non - lte radiative transfer models .",
    ".summary of the line ratios observed in the four sample galaxies [ cols=\">,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath7 : for ngc7479 , 10  30 is the range encountered in high resolution interferometric observations , while 23 is the average ratio over the central 1kpc radius .",
    "we will now discuss the results of line intensity ratio studies done toward four sample galaxies that show the range of ratios we can expect to encounter . to relate the ratios discussed , a typical value for @xmath2(10 ) in the galactic disk is @xmath8 ( polk et al.1988 ) , ( starburst ) nuclei typically have @xmath2(10 ) of 10  15 ( aalto et al .",
    "1995 ) , and a few luminous infrared mergers show ` abnormally high ' ratios of @xmath9 ( aalto et al .  1991 , casoli , dupraz , & combes 1992 ) .",
    "the line ratios we have obtained for our sample galaxies are summarized in table1 .",
    "* ugc2855 and ugc2866 : * ugc2855 is a sbc spiral at a distance of @xmath10 20mpc , a weak starburst . ugc2866 , its smaller companion , also has a bar morphology and is a strong starburst with warm dust ( iras @xmath11m@xmath12 m ratio @xmath13 ) .",
    "we have observed both galaxies with the ovro interferometer as well as with the oso and hht single dish telescopes ( httemeister , aalto , & wall 1999 ) .",
    "ugc2855 , which we believe to be in a ` pre - starburst ' state without strong bar shocks , still in the process of accumulating gas in the center , is characterized by ` normal ' values for @xmath2(10 ) and @xmath2(21 ) ( see table1 ) .",
    "in contrast , ugc2866 has a very high central @xmath2(10 ) ( @xmath14 ) , a value so far only encountered in a few starburst mergers .",
    "ugc2866 , while a strong starburst , is not a merger , and its fir luminosity is moderate at @xmath15 .",
    "the value for @xmath2(21 ) drops into the normal range ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the high @xmath0co / hcn(10 ) ratio of @xmath17 ( only a limit for the hcn emission could be obtained ) is also noteworthy and interesting in a starburst galaxy that should contain a significant amount of dense gas .",
    "* ngc7479 * is a well - studied sbc starburst spiral at @xmath18mpc ( e.g. httemeister et al .",
    "2000 , laine et al .",
    "1999 ) . globally",
    ", i.e.  avaraged over bar and center , @xmath2(10 ) is very high , interferometric observations of the central starburst region show significant variations between normal and high ratios , with a ` high ' avarage of 23 . within the bar the variation is even more extreme , between extremely high ratios exceeding 40 and disk - like low ratios of @xmath19 .",
    "again , @xmath2(21 ) in the starburst center is within the normal range ( 13 ) ( fig.1 ) .",
    "* ngc4123 * is a fairly inconspicuous sbc starburst galaxy with cool dust ( iras @xmath11m@xmath12 m ratio @xmath20 ) .",
    "still , once more we find a high @xmath2(10 ) value of 26 , accompanied by a normal @xmath2(21 ) of 14 and undetected hcn(10 ) emission ( @xmath0co / hcn(10 ) @xmath21 ) ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the very low ( disk - like ) @xmath2 of @xmath22 at the bar ends is noteworthy .",
    "the observations of the four sample galaxies described above leave us with a somewhat surprising result : there seems to be a class of non - merger barred spiral ( starburst ) galaxies with moderate ir luminosities that have a high @xmath2(10 ) , thought to be the exclusive property of a few extreme starburst mergers . while only a minority among the barred spirals as well as the mergers a ` high - ratio ' galaxies ( as will be further discussed in a forthcoming paper examining a larger sample of starburst galaxies , httemeister & aalto , in prep . )",
    ", it indicates variations of the dominating component of the molecular ism within the same morphological group ( barred galaxies and mergers ) .",
    "thus , we can hope that with more detailed modelling we will be able to link these differences in @xmath2 and other line ratios to the evolutionary processes .",
    "even now , we can examine the standard explanations for high @xmath2 put forward for mergers and see whether they are applicable in a barred starburst environment .",
    "infall of low @xmath1co - abundance gas can be excluded for barred starbursts , since typically @xmath2 drops toward the bar ends ( see the example of ngc4123 ) . in situ",
    "nucleosynthesis effects in the central starburst also seem unlikely , since high ratios are found as well along the bar . the selective in situ",
    "removal of @xmath1co ( e.g.  by selective photodissociation ) is possible in principle and may play a role , especially in diffuse gas .",
    "however , we typically find that @xmath2(21 ) is normal when @xmath2(10 ) is high",
    ". this may also be the case for most starburst mergers ( though the opposite has been claimed by e.g.  taniguchi , ohyama & sanders 1999 ) and will be discussed in our forthcoming paper .",
    "this behaviour leaves _ excitation effects _ as the only reasonable explanation .",
    "a simple one - component non - lte radiative transfer model indicates high temperatures ( @xmath23k ) and moderate densities of a few @xmath24@xmath5 as a possible set of physical properties that cause a combination of high values of @xmath2(10 ) and moderate @xmath2(21 ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in sect.1 , the molecular ism in a starburst nucleus certainly consists of multiple components . in fig.3",
    ", we show a cartoon of different simplified scenarios that may dominate in a starburst nucleus .",
    "panel1 depicts the one - component scenario described above .",
    "panel2 shows a situation that may be realized in many starburst nuclei displaying ` normal ' values of 10  15 in both @xmath2(10 ) and ( 21 ) .",
    "clearly , some hot , dense cores are also needed to make a starburst , but it is possible that the dense component cools so efficiently that a significant fraction of the material remains at temperatures of 15  30k . in this case , most @xmath0co emission arises in the envelopes , while more than half of the @xmath1co emission originates in the cores .",
    "this scenario is probably realized in ngc1808 ( aalto et al .",
    "1994 ) . in panel3",
    ", we display a ` raisin roll ' scenario , with warm cores embedded in a warm , unbound , diffuse intercloud medium . here , almost all @xmath0co emission arises in the diffuse medium , but @xmath1co originates almost exclusively in the cores . a medium like this may be encountered in the high pressure environment of extreme starbursts and can give higher @xmath2(10 ) than ( 21 ) ( aalto et al .",
    "finally , the situation described in panel4 , a purely diffuse medium , is unlikely to be realized in starburst nuclei , but may be encountered along a molecular bar . here ,",
    "both @xmath2(10 ) and ( 21 ) are expected to be high .",
    "clearly , other combinations of the components shown are possible , and in more detailed modelling complementary information , e.g.  on high density tracers and possible positional offsets between the distribution of different species have to be taken into account .",
    "we have shown that the gas properties of the starburst centers of barred galaxies can be analyzed by means of the line ratios of co isotopomers .",
    "detailed modelling of the the significant variations encountered can indicate the evolutionary state of the burst .",
    "high values of @xmath2(10 ) found in three sample galaxies are of special interest , since so far these properties were exclusively linked to probably shortlived , extreme burst phases of ir - luminous mergers containing hot dust .",
    "we have presented simple scenarios that can explain variations in @xmath2 , all based on changes in molecular excitation .",
