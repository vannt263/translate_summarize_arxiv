    "it is now widely accepted that the galactic center ( gc ) hosts a supermassive black hole ( sbh ) @xcite , whose position coincides with that of the radio - source sagittarius a@xmath14 ( sgr a@xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "the sbh has a mass of the order of @xmath15m@xmath16 @xcite and , consequently , a schwarzschild radius @xmath17 au . in its immediate vicinity a number of rapidly orbiting stars @xcite have been detected and tracked in the infrared since 1992 at the 8.2-m very large telescope ( vlt ) on cerro paranal , chile and the 3.58-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) on la silla , chile @xcite , and since 1995 at the keck 10-m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii @xcite .",
    "they are mostly main - sequence stars of spectral class b , and are naturally used as test particles for the gravitational potential in which they move . particularly important is the bright star s2 ( s0 - 2 in the keck nomenclature ) , of spectral type b0 - 2 v , orbiting the sbh in @xmath18 yr along an orbit with ellipticity @xmath5 and semimajor axis @xmath7 au @xcite .",
    "indeed , a complete orbital revolution of it is now covered by the available data records @xcite .",
    "if we look at the smallness of the ratio @xmath19 of the average distance @xmath20 to the schwarzschild radius @xmath21 as an index of the importance of the einstein s general theory of relativity ( gtr ) in several astronomical and astrophysical systems , it can be easily realized that the galactic sbh and its stars is , in principle , an ideal local laboratory to put on the test gtr and other alternative theories of gravity .",
    "indeed , by considering the earth s artificial satellite lageos @xcite , the sun s planet mercury , the extrasolar planet wasp-19b @xcite , the double binary pulsar psr j0737 - 3039a / b @xcite and the star s2 in , we have    lll _ lageos&= & 1.38331910 ^ 9 , +   + _ mercury&= & 2.002310 ^ 7 , +   + _ wasp-19b & = & 8.7410 ^ 5 , +   + _ psr  j0737 - 3039a / b & = & 1.1510 ^ 5 , +   + _ s2 & = & 1.710 ^ 4 .    it can be noted that @xmath19 for s2 is one order of magnitude smaller than that for psr j0737 - 3039a / b . in this respect ,",
    "several authors @xcite worked out with a variety of techniques and approximations the direct effects of gtr on different quantities characterizing the orbital motions about the sbh , mainly some keplerian orbital elements . if , on the one hand , they are useful to give valuable insights about the magnitude of the relativistic effects occurring in such a scenario , on the other hand they are not directly measurable .    concerning the motion of the s stars around the sbh in the gc , the directly observable quantities are the astrometric measurements of their positions in the sky in terms of right ascension @xmath22 and declination @xmath23 , and their radial velocities @xmath1 . concerning the first kind of observations , according to @xcite",
    ", future astrometric measurements of s2 may bring its relativistic perinigricon in the case of a bh . before",
    ", the term was used by the physicist g.a .",
    "@xcite in a science - fiction tale of him . ] precession @xmath24 into the measurability domain .",
    "indeed , the perinigricon rate would be indirectly inferred from the corresponding apparent position shift . to this aim",
    ", it must also be considered that such a shift is not as easily detected as it may seem since it needs to be measured from the same data from which also the orbital elements have to be determined @xcite .",
    "thus , here we will focus on the dynamical effects directly caused by gtr and other competing classical forces on the radial velocity @xmath1 . on the one hand",
    ", it will be possible to straightforwardly work out in an analytical way the net time variations of it averaged over one orbital revolution .",
    "this allows for a more direct and unambiguous confrontation of the theoretical predictions with the observations . on the other hand , from a practical point of view",
    "the radial velocity data are easier to handle with respect to the astrometric observations .",
    "indeed , the inclusion of new data into pre - existent records needs no special care because the radial velocities refer to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) @xcite . instead , for the astrometric data it turns out that only an approximate realization of a reference frame is possible .",
    "it implies that the exact definition of the coordinates is a matter of each data analysis in such a way that simply merging two different sets of astrometric positions would yield incorrect results @xcite .    in our calculation",
    ", we will proceed as follows . for",
    "the sake of generality , let us assume that an explicit , analytical expression is available for a given observable @xmath25 in such a way that it is function of all or some keplerian orbital elements , i.e. @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the true anomaly , and @xmath28 denotes the ensemble of the keplerian orbital elements explicitly entering @xmath25 apart from the mean anomaly @xmath29 .",
    "then , we straightforwardly compute its secular variation as the sum of two parts . the first one is purely keplerian , and it vanishes over one orbital period @xmath30 .",
    "the second one is due to the non - keplerian variations of all the orbital elements induced by the dynamical perturbation considered .",
    "the total result is , thus , = = ( ) _ 0 ^ 2 ( ) df.in it , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the instantaneous variations is the sum of the keplerian mean motion @xmath33 and a non - keplerian term , as we will see later . its keplerian part yields from the keplerian variation of @xmath25 . ] of the keplerian orbital elements computed with , e.g. , the gauss variation equations and evaluated onto the unperturbed keplerian ellipse ,",
    "while @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the usual keplerian expressions for such derivatives : see and below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ accelez ]",
    "we deal with some kinds of both classical and relativistic perturbing accelerations .",
    "the long - term effects caused by them on the radial velocity are analytically worked out in section [ velazza ] . in section [ numerizi ]",
    "we perform numerical calculations by using the s2 star , and confront them with the present - day measurement accuracy .",
    "section [ conclu ] is devoted to the summarizing our findings .",
    "here we deal with a generic perturbing acceleration @xmath36 induced by a given dynamical effect which can be considered as small with respect to the main newtonian monopole @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the newtonian constant of gravitation and @xmath39 is the relative star - sbh distance .",
    "the stars orbiting the sbh are assumed test particles : their masses are about @xmath40 , and relativistic corrections to their internal structures are assumed to be too small to yield noticeable effects on their orbital motions .",
    "first , @xmath36 has to be projected onto the radial , transverse and normal orthogonal unit vectors @xmath41 of the co - moving frame of the test particle orbiting the central body acting as source of the gravitational field .",
    "their components , in cartesian coordinates of a reference frame centered in the primary , are @xcite =(    c u  -u + u + u + u +    ) =(    c -u - u + -u+u + u +    ) =(    c + - +   +    ) . in - , @xmath42 are the longitude of the ascending node plane from the reference @xmath43 direction to the line of the nodes . ] , the argument of pericenter , reckoned from the line of the nodes . ] , and the inclination of the orbital plane to the reference @xmath44 plane , respectively . in general , we will choose the unit vector @xmath45 of the line - of - sight , pointing from the object to the observer , to be directed along the positive @xmath46 axis , so that the @xmath44 plane coincides with the usual plane of the sky .",
    "with such a choice , corresponding to the frame actually used in data reduction @xcite , @xmath47 is the familiar @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is an angle in the plane of the sky counted from the mean vernal point at j2000 epoch along which the reference @xmath43 axis is customarily chosen ; it is such a node which is actually determined from the observations @xcite .",
    "in other cases , in order to compute more easily certain dynamical perturbations , we will orient our frame with the @xmath46 axis aligned with the central body s proper angular momentum @xmath50 , so that the reference @xmath44 plane will coincide with the body s equatorial plane . in this case , @xmath49 will be an angle lying in such a plane , and it is not the one released in literature @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath51 is the argument of latitude .",
    "subsequently , the projected components of @xmath36 have to be evaluated onto the keplerian ellipse r= ,  pa(1-e^2),where @xmath52 is the semilatus rectum and @xmath53 are the semi - major axis and the eccentricity , respectively .",

    "as explained in the introduction , the right - hand - sides of , computed for the perturbing accelerations of the dynamical effect considered , have to be inserted into the analytic expression of the time variation @xmath60 of the observable @xmath25 of interest which , then , must be averaged over one orbital revolution according to by means of @xcite df = ( ) ^2d , and dt = df .      in its slow - motion and weak - field approximation , gtr predicts that a slowly rotating central body of mass @xmath61 and proper angular momentum @xmath50 induces two kinds of small perturbations on the otherwise keplerian orbital motion of a test particle .",
    "the largest one is dubbed gravitoelectric ( ge ) @xcite , and depends only on the mass @xmath61 of the body which acts as source of the gravitational field .",
    "it is responsible of the well - known anomalous secular precession of the perihelion of mercury of @xmath62 arcsec cty@xmath10 in the field of the sun .",
    "there is also a smaller perturbation , known as gravitomagnetic ( gm ) @xcite , which depends on @xmath50 : it causes the lense - thirring @xcite precessions of the node and pericenter of a test particle . in the linearized gravitoelectromagnetic ( gem ) approximation , the general relativistic perturbing acceleration @xmath63 to be added to the newtonian monopole @xmath64 is @xcite a_gtr =- e_g -2()b_g , with    lll e_g & = & - , +   + b_g & = & - ,    where @xmath65 denotes the speed of light in vacuum .",

    ", the existence of the horizon in the @xcite metric , which describes the spacetime outside it , implies a maximum value for its angular momentum @xcite l_^(max)=.if such a limit is actually reached or not by astrophysical bhs depends on their accretion history @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent measurements of the spin of the sbh in obtained in the context of discseismology by means of newly detected quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of radio emission point towards @xcite _ = 0.440.08 . actually , in the case of the s stars orbiting the sbh in , while the weak - field approximation is acceptable since for s2 = = = 410 ^ -5 , the slow - motion approximation may be , in principle , less adequate .",
    "indeed , the speed of , say , s2 at perinigricon is as large as @xmath68 of the speed of light , while at aponigricon it is @xmath69 of @xmath65 .",

    "it has to be pointed out that the total accuracy reachable in the changes in the radial velocities is actually impacted by the uncertainty in lsr itself . indeed , as explained by @xcite , to obtain the radial velocities with respect to the lsr , each observed radial velocity has to be corrected for the earth s rotation , its motion around the sun , and the sun s peculiar motion with respect to the lsr ( nominal value @xmath127 km s@xmath10 , directed radially inwards , @xcite ) .",

    "searches for pulsars orbiting the sbh are currently underway @xcite ; their discovery may yield orbiting probes with a better accuracy in their radial velocity changes .",
    "these considerations show that while the gravitomagnetic and the quadrupole effects are far from being directly detectable in such a way , the gravitoelectric trend lies just at the edge of the measurability capabilities .",
    "the effect of the diffuse dark matter inside the orbit of s2 is one order of magnitude smaller than the general relativistic ge one .",
    "incidentally , such figures indicate that higher - order corrections to the computed effects of - in the linear gem approximation due to the relativistic motion of s2 can be neglected at the moment .",
    "one of the directly measurable quantities of the system constituted by the s stars orbiting the supermassive black hole located at the center of the milky way in the radio source is the radial velocity .",
    "given that s2 has already completed one full orbital revolution , with a period of 15.9 yr , since its discovery , and in view of the possible detection in the near future of other stars and pulsars with shorter orbital periods , we looked at the cumulative , long term time variations of the radial velocity caused by several newtonian and einsteinian dynamical effects .",
    "they are both the general relativistic schwarzschild and kerr - like components of the spacetime metric , the quadrupole mass moment and the diffuse dark mass distribution made by stellar remnants enclosed within the star s orbit .",

    "even if such evaluations will turn out to be not too optimistic , a detection of the kerr and the quadrupole - induced cumulative changes of the radial velocity seems to be unfeasible .",
