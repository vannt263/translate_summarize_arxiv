    "core - holes are created when matter is irradiated with energetic photons .",
    "the net binding energy is obtained from the kinetic energy of the photoelectron upon subtracting the photon energy .",
    "as the target size increases from the isolated atom via molecules and clusters to , ultimately , bulk matter , the shift of the net binding energy contains information about the screening capability of the other electrons in the system and allows to investigate , e.g. , metal - to - nonmetal transitions .",
    "in fact , x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) is well - established and work has been extensively devoted to measure core - level binding energy shifts in solids and at surfaces @xcite .",
    "however , the systematic study of core - level shifts as a function of the target size became possible only recently because of the necessity of having size - selected clusters and tunable , powerful x - ray sources such as free - electron lasers available .    from the theoretical point of view , the calculation of core - level binding energies in many - electron systems is non - trivial both conceptually and computationally @xcite .",
    "the study of atoms , clusters or bulk , in which suddenly a core - electron is removed by single - photon ionization , has a long history , starting probably with slater s transition state theory @xcite and various kinds of self - consistent field methods ( @xmath0scfs ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath0scf - approaches are based on energy balances between electronic configurations , and it is not always clear whether relaxed or unrelaxed configurations should be taken . here , `` relaxed '' means that the other electrons are allowed to assume the new , energetically most favorable configuration  albeit without _ filling _ the core - hole .",
    "`` unrelaxed '' means that the other electrons are kept frozen .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the unrelaxed energy difference between final and initial configuration should be considered if the photoelectron escapes too rapidly to notice the relaxation dynamics of the other electrons @xcite .",
    "methodologically , self - consistent field methods like hartree - fock ( hf ) or density functional theory ( dft ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are usually employed for the calculation of energy differences between final and initial configurations in @xmath0scf approaches . as both methods introduce orbitals and orbital energies ,",
    "the interesting question arises how these orbital energies are related to the ( relaxed or unrelaxed ) binding energies @xcite . clearly , the energy difference depends on initial _ and _ final state while the orbital energies do not , unless fractional occupation numbers , as in slater s transition state theory , are introduced .",
    "we use an extended na - cluster jellium model with an _ all - electron _ na atom in the center in order to have core - levels in the system at all .",
    "this model may be viewed as a hybrid of the pure cluster jellium model @xcite and bulk - models in which atoms are immersed in homogeneous electron gas @xcite .",
    "we employ dft to calculate relaxed and unrelaxed energy differences between the initial ground state and the final configuration with either a valence electron or a 2p - core electron removed .",
    "the results as a function of the cluster size ( up to 58 atoms ) are compared with the prediction of the metal sphere - model .",
    "time - dependent dft ( tddft ) ( see @xcite for a state - of - the - art account ) is used to investigate the screening _ dynamics _ after the sudden removal of a 2p electron .",
