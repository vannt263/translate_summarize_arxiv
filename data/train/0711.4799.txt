    "one of the most striking characteristics of quantum mechanics is represented by the entanglement .",
    "it plays a role in fundamental aspects , like non - locality @xcite , and applicative ones , like quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest the experimental generation and manipulation of entangled systems @xcite and the theoretical study of the entanglement evolution .",
    "it is an important subject the analysis of entanglement decay and its relation with decoherence induced by the unavoidable interaction of the systems of interest with the environment .",
    "the study of the entanglement evolution of two qubits , initially in a bell state and exposed to local zero temperature and markovian noisy environments , has led to the surprising result that it may markedly differ from the single qubit coherence evolution . in particular , in front of an exponential decrease of the single qubit coherence , the entanglement may instead completely disappear at a finite time @xcite , a phenomenon known as `` entanglement sudden death '' ( esd ) which has been proven to occur in a quantum optics experiment @xcite .",
    "esd appears to put a limitation to the time when entanglement could usefully exploited .",
    "its intrinsic and practical interest has led to several investigations in markovian environments at either zero or finite temperature and for initially pure and mixed states @xcite .",
    "the disentanglement phenomenon being linked to the creation of body - environment correlations makes interesting to analyze its behavior in a non - markovian system where memory effects are relevant @xcite .",
    "recently , a procedure has been developed that allows to obtain the complete dynamics of the two - qubit system by knowing the dynamics of each qubit interacting with its environment , which is applicable to any initial condition .",
    "this has permitted to show , for two noninteracting qubits initially described by pure bell - like states and in non - markovian environment at zero temperature , that entanglement may reappear after some period of time of complete disappearance @xcite .",
    "this appears relevant from a fundamental point of view and because also may permit to extend the time of usefulness of entanglement .",
    "the aim of this paper is to generalize the results obtained in ref .  @xcite first giving a formal extension of the procedure described above from two qubits to @xmath0 independent qudits ( @xmath1-level systems ) , each interacting with its own reservoir .",
    "then , we shall apply it to determine the entanglement dynamics of two identical qubits , initially described by a generalization of mixed werner - like states , in non - markovian environment at zero temperature , extending to a wider class of initial conditions the previous study .",
    "this will permit to find how entanglement dynamics and its revivals are related to physical parameters like the purity and the degree of entanglement of the initial states or to the amount of non - markovianity of the system .",
    "then , we shall exploit our procedure to extend in a simple way the previous analysis of two - qubit entanglement in a markovian environment at finite temperature to the initial extended werner - like states .",
    "this will permit to link the occurrence time of esd to the purity or the degree of entanglement of the initial states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ procedure ]",
    "we propose a general procedure to solve the dynamics of @xmath0 independent qudits . in section  [ model ]",
    "we give a standard hamiltonian model describing the dynamics of single qubit - reservoir interaction , and we also determine the two - qubit density matrix evolution . in section  [ istatesandconcurrence ]",
    "we introduce our initial states and recall the definition of concurrence to quantify the two - qubit entanglement . in section  [ non - markoviandynamics ] we study the two - qubit entanglement dynamics in non - markovian environments at zero temperature while in section  [ markoviandynamics ] we analyze the effects of the temperature on the entanglement dynamics in markovian environments . in section  [ concl ]",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider a system formed by @xmath0 non - interacting parts @xmath2 , each part consisting of a @xmath1 level system ( qudit ) @xmath3 , locally interacting respectively with a reservoir @xmath4 .",
    "each qudit @xmath5 and the corresponding reservoir @xmath6 are initially considered independent . the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the single qudit @xmath5 is given by @xmath7 where the trace is over the reservoir @xmath6 degrees of freedom and @xmath8 is the time evolution operator for the part @xmath9 . by using the spectral decomposition of the density matrix @xmath10 of the reservoir",
    "@xmath11 the reduced density matrix @xmath12 can be expressed in the so called operator - sum representation as @xcite @xmath13 where the operators @xmath14 are given by @xmath15    the assumption of independent parts implies that the time evolution operator @xmath16 of the complete system @xmath17 factorizes as @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that the operator - sum representation of the reduced density matrix for the @xmath0-qudit system ( @xmath19 ) reads like @xmath20 given the basis @xmath21 for the qudit @xmath5 , inserting the unity operators @xmath22 between operators and density matrix in eq .",
    "( [ krausrep ] ) , it follows that the dynamics of each qudit has the form @xmath23 adopting the same procedure for the @xmath0-qudit reduced density matrix @xmath24 given in eq .",

    "( [ singleevo ] ) and ( [ totalevo ] ) clearly show that the dynamics of @xmath0-qudit density matrix elements follows by knowing the ones of each single qudit , and that it is applicable to any initial condition of the total system .",
    "we wish to point out that the procedure developed above , which permits to obtain the dynamics of @xmath0 independent qudits each locally interacting with its own reservoir , can be also applied to the case where the reservoir is unique but the qudits are placed at distances larger than the spatial correlation length of the reservoir .",
    "another point we wish to stress is the practical aspect of our procedure .",
    "in fact , it allows to obtain the dynamics of @xmath0 qudits , provided that the dynamics of each qubit is known , by purely algebraic way and independently from the initial conditions .",
    "this considerably simplify the work typically required by writing and solving differential equations for the density matrix elements of the total system @xcite or by using other approaches whose difficulty increases with the number of parts , levels or environmental noise complexity of the total system @xcite .",
    "we now shall apply the above procedure to the case of a system composed by two parts , each one consisting of a two - level system ( qubit ) interacting with a reservoir .",
