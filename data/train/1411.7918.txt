    "the recent measurements of the exclusive quarkonium photoproduction by alice @xcite and lhcb @xcite collaborations at the lhc have imposed serious constraints to the theoretical models for the vector meson production .",
    "the forward and central rapidities regions are mapping the dynamics at very small bjorken-@xmath3 values , @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath0 this means values of @xmath5 at central rapidity in proton - proton collisions at 7 tev ( in lead - lead collisions at 2.76 tev ) .",
    "accordingly , the theoretical uncertainty in these cases is very large as the underlying models basically depend on the gluons distribution squared , which is uncertain at the small-@xmath3 regime .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the nuclear case , where there is the additional problem of determining the nuclear gluon distribution function .",
    "a very promising approach is given by the color dipole framework @xcite , where the inclusive and exclusive processes can be treated simultaneously .",
    "moreover , the dipole framework allows to include in a simple way the corrections associated to the parton saturation phenomenon @xcite and to introduce information on dynamics beyond the leading logarithmic qcd approach .    as a summary on our recent works in the subject , in ref .",
    "@xcite the photoproduction of @xmath6 and @xmath7 states were computed in color dipole formalism and the results are in good agreement with lhcb data @xcite on @xmath8 collisions at 7 tev . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite the same states were analyzed in the lead - lead collisions at 2.76 tev , including the coherent and incoherent contributions .",
    "the predictions are somehow consistent with the alice data @xcite .",
    "it was verified that the theoretical uncertainty is very large compared to the proton case , mostly at central rapidities .",
    "the quarkonium production , i.e. the @xmath0 and @xmath2 states , in proton - lead collisions were investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , it was included predictions for the rapidity distribution in backward and forward regions in the process @xmath9 . in the proton - lead case it is possible to investigate at the same time the dynamics on the photon - proton cross section and on the photon - nucleus cross section .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the photon - proton interaction as the photon flux due to the nucleus is higher compared to that due to the proton .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the photon - nucleus contribution is relevant at large rapidities and increasingly important for the @xmath2 states .",
    "the present work is an extension of ref .",
    "@xcite , where now we consider the process @xmath10 , which has recently been measured by alice collaboration @xcite in 5.02 tev energy .",
    "the focus is on the investigation of the theoretical uncertainties associated to the models for the dipole cross section and meson wavefunction .",
    "furthermore , we provide predictions for the exclusive @xmath2 production in coherent and incoherent lead - lead collisions at the lhc including their theoretical uncertainties .",
    "let us summarize the main expressions from the theoretical approach considered in present study . for proton - nucleus interaction at large impact parameter ( @xmath11 ) and at ultra - relativistic energies",
    "it is expected that the electromagnetic interaction to be dominant . in this case , the exclusive meson photoproduction in hadron - target collisions can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and photon - target production cross section @xcite . the photon energy spectrum for protons and nuclei , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which depend on the photon energy @xmath14 ,",
    "are well understood ( see details for the photon flux on protons or nuclei in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for proton - lead collisions at the lhc energies , where the meson rapidity is positive in the proton beam direction , the quarkonium rapidity distribution reads as @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the corresponding photon flux and @xmath17 , with @xmath14 being the photon energy .",
    "the case for the inverse beam direction is straightforward .",
    "similarly , the rapidity distribution @xmath18 in nucleus - nucleus collisions has the same factorized form , @xmath19 , \\label{dsigdya}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the photon flux in nucleus is denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath20 ( coherent case ) or @xmath21 ( incoherent case ) .      here",
    ", the photon - pomeron interaction will be described within the light - cone dipole frame , where the probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair with transverse separation @xmath22 ( and momentum fraction @xmath23 ) long after the interaction , which then scatters off the hadron .",
    "the cross section for exclusive photoproduction of vector meson off a nucleon target is given by @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the light - cone wavefunction of the photon and of the vector meson , respectively .",

    "we consider the energy dependence of the slope using the regge motivated expression , @xmath30 ( the values of parameters for @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    accordingly ,",
    "the exclusive photoproduction off nuclei for coherent and incoherent processes can be simply computed in high energies where the large coherence length @xmath33 is fairly valid .",

    "the factor @xmath76 incorporates the skewness effect , coming from the fact that the gluons attached to the @xmath77 can carry different light - front fractions @xmath78 of the proton .",
    "the skewedness factor given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) was obtained at nlo level , in the limit that @xmath79 and at small @xmath80 assuming that the diagonal gluon density of target has a power - law form @xcite .",
    "similar corrections have been introduced also for the photonuclear cross section .    as a comment on the reliability of the present calculation ,",
    "the non - forward wavefunction @xcite was not considered as the dipole cross sections used have not explicit impact - parameter or @xmath80-dependence .",
    "there are few phenomenological models in literature considering b - dependence ( ip - saturation model @xcite and cgc impact parameter model ( b - cgc ) @xcite ) and they basically take into account gaussian - like behavior associated to the proton wavefunction ( this is enough to describe the small-@xmath80 region from data on @xmath81 exclusive processes ) .",
    "the same comment applies to the marquet - peschanski - soyez ( mps ) model @xcite , where explicit @xmath80-dependence for dipole cross section is considered . in any case , the iim dipole cross section considered in our calculation is a limit case ( @xmath82 ) for both cgc impact parameter and mps models .",
    "the more complex question of b - dependence coming from the evolution equations for the dipole amplitude is work in progress and it is an open question by now ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "we considered a simpler approach , where the @xmath29 slope is taken from a parameterization for the measured values at hera and we consider only the forward dipole amplitude ( this diminishes the theoretical uncertainty associated to the specific model for the b - dependence in dipole amplitude ) .",
    "it would be opportune to compare our calculation to the results from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the photoproduction of @xmath0 has been considered using both the ip - saturation and the b - cgc models .",
    "concerning the expression for the dipole - nucleus cross section , we are using the glauber - gribov ( smooth nucleus ) approach which has been tested against small-@xmath3 data for nuclear structure functions ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "a more refined treatment of nuclear effects has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the gluons form a lumpy distribution within the nucleus . to account for this correlation among the gluons",
    "those authors generalize the smooth nucleus model .",
    "it was shown that only if the atomic mass number @xmath83 is large and dipole size @xmath22 is small the smooth nucleus formula is recovered .",
    "this is the case for the calculation we are considering : lead nucleus and heavy meson production with typical dipole sizes given by @xmath84 .",
    "we are now ready to obtain the rapidity distribution for @xmath31 production in proton - lead collisions at the energy of 5.02 tev at the lhc ( an analysis for @xmath32 has been done in refs.@xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]-(a ) is presented the results for @xmath0 taking into account the boosted gaussian ( bg ) wavefunction and some samples of phenomenological models for the dipole cross section as discussed before .",
    "the solid curve stands for the iim - old dipole cross section , whereas the dotted - dashed line represents the result using the new fit , iim - new .",
    "the dashed curve stands for the gbw parametrisation .",
    "the behavior at very large rapidities tends to be similar for the distinct models .",
    "however , towards midi - rapidity at mid - rapidities there is an evident model dependence .",
    "the iim - old and gbw parameterization deliver quite similar results , whereas iim - new produces a overall normalization large than the others .",
    "this is mainly due the smaller values of the charm quark mass considered ( @xmath85 gev in contrast to @xmath47 gev for iim - old and gbw ) .",
    "we have introduced also the alice data @xcite for forward rapidities : the wide range @xmath86 ( filled square ) and three sub - bins y:[3.5,4.0],[3.0,4.0 ] and [ 2.5,3.0 ] ( filled circles ) . using the bg wavefunction , gbw seems to be mode consistent considering the error bars . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]-(b ) , the results are now presented for the light cone gaussian ( lcg ) wavefunction and the notation is the same as for the previous plot .",
    "now , the iim - new option does the better job in data description and it is observed a smaller deviation between iim - old and iim - new for the lcg wavefunction .",
    "this is due the difference in the @xmath42 function , which does not depend explicitly on @xmath87 in the lcg case .",
    "the predictions using the lcg wavefunction are in general smaller than the bg wavefunction case .",
    "the alice collaboration has also measured the rapidity cross section for the case @xmath88 in the region @xmath89 , where @xmath90 @xmath91b .",
    "we compute the corresponding cross section using the same rapidity cut and obtain @xmath92 @xmath91b ( for bg wavefuntion ) and @xmath93 @xmath91b ( for lcg wavefuntion ) .",
    "the error is related to the theoretical uncertainty in the dipole cross section .",
    "the origin of this clear discrepancy could for instance be traced back in the expressions for the photon flux for nucleus , @xmath94 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the strong proton - nucleus interaction reduces drastically the photon flux at large rapidities .",
    "let us now investigate the photonuclear production of @xmath2 in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc .",

    "the thick curves correspond to the result using bg wavefunction and the thin curves are for lcg wavefunction ( multiplied by a factor 0.5 for better visualization ) .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty associated to the model for wavefunction is different compared to the pa case and now the results are similar .",
    "the main reason is that we are considering the same mass for the bottom quark , @xmath48 in both parameterizations .",
    "it is verified that the deviation is significant concerning the distinct models for the dipole cross section mostly at large rapidities . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] one presents the results for the incoherent production of @xmath2 , @xmath96 taking into account the bg and lcg wavefunctions .",
    "the notation in figure is the same as for fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . as for the coherent case , the deviation is quite small when comparing the dependence on the meson wavefunction .",
    "we notice that we are not introduced the effect of nuclear break up as we are considering here events with no neutron emitted in any direction ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the strong fields associated with heavy - ions lead to large probabilities for exchanging additional photons when a @xmath2 meson is produced at small impact parameters and they will excite one or both of the nuclei and lead to break up .    finally , we discuss the possible limitations of current approach . here",

    "@xcite that the color dipole model dramatically overestimates the @xmath98 alice data point on coherent @xmath0 photoproduction in pb - pb upcs at 2.76 tev and that the agreement can be achieved only by introducing an _ ad hoc _ the gluon shadowing factor of @xmath99 . at the same time",
