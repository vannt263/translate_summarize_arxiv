    "in recent years , the measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies verified a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation to high precision @xcite .",
    "this observational fact is highly consistent with the predictions from the perturbation theory of inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "therefore , inflation , which originally appeared in early 80 s @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , has become the most prevailing paradigm of describing the very early universe .",
    "furthermore , inflationary cosmology also predicts a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves , of which the magnitude is relatively smaller than that of the primordial curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "if these primordial tensor fluctuations exist , they could lead to the @xmath0-mode polarization signals in the cmb @xcite and hence are expected to be observed in cosmological surveys .",
    "so far there is no observational evidence that indicates existence of the primordial tensor fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "however , as was pointed out in  @xcite , a suppression of power in the @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum at large scales might exist , which implies that a spectrum of primordial gravitational waves could have a blue tilt .",
    "thus , from the perspective of theoretical interpretations , it is interesting to investigate whether a power spectrum of primordial gravitational waves with a blue tilt can be achieved in the framework of inflationary cosmology .",
    "this question has already drawn the attention of cosmologists in the literature , and a couple of different mechanisms were put forward , namely the beyond - slow - roll inflation @xcite , the matter - bounce inflation @xcite , inflation with non - bunch - davis vacuum @xcite , the non - commutative field inflation @xcite , the variable gravity quintessential inflation @xcite , the string gas cosmology @xcite , or the hawking radiation during inflation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a careful characterization of the power spectrum of the primordial @xmath0-mode polarization is very important to falsify the paradigms of very early universe ( see @xcite for the characterization of the primordial gravitational waves within various very early universe models ) .    in the present work",
    "we make a remark on the potential challenge of regular inflation models to generate a blue tilt for the primordial gravitational waves . we restrict ourselves within the standard general relativity and present a potential resolution to this challenge by proposing to extend the parameter space of inflation models by including non - canonical operators . in particular",
    ", we phenomenologically consider a class of inflation models with the horndeski operator being involved .",
    "such models were considered in inflationary cosmology for the purpose of circumventing the paradigm of higgs inflation @xcite , and are dubbed as  g - inflation \" @xcite ( see for example  @xcite for generalized analyses and see @xcite for a counter - claim from the stability viewpoint ) . in our construction , differing from the application of the galilean symmetry , inflation is driven by a scalar field with a horndeski operator which could be achieved either by the kinetic term or the potential energy .",
    "we investigate the dynamics of this cosmological system by performing a detailed phase space analysis .",
    "we find that in general the generation of a blue tilt of the primordial gravitational waves in a viable inflation model is difficult since the expected trajectories are not stable in the phase space .",
    "however , a short period of super - inflationary phase might be possible and thus would circumvent the above theoretical challenges .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : general ] , we briefly review the standard picture of predictions made by regular inflation models on the primordial curvature and tensor perturbations",
    ". we can see that it is forbidden to produce a power spectrum of the primordial tensor modes with a blue tilt in a wide class of inflation models .",
    "then , in section [ sec : model ] we present a class of extended inflation models by including a parameterized horndeski operator . by selecting several typical inflation potentials ,",
    "we perform the dynamical analyses in details and derive their attractor solutions .",
    "we show that the inflationary trajectories with a blue tilt do not correspond to these stable solutions .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section [ sec : conclusions ] . throughout the article",
    "we take the sign of the metric @xmath1 and define the reduced planck mass by @xmath2 .",
    "in the paradigm of inflationary cosmology , both the primordial curvature perturbation and gravitational waves are originated from quantum fluctuations in a nearly exponentially expanding universe at high energy scales . during this expansion ,",
    "the physical wavelengths of the metric fluctuations are stretched out of the hubble radius and then form power spectra as observed in the cmb .",
    "such a convenient causal mechanism of generating primordial perturbations can determine their power spectra by a series of simple relations .",
    "particularly , for a general inflation model with a k - essence lagrangian  @xcite , the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath3 is determined by four parameters , namely the hubble rate @xmath4 , the spectral index @xmath5 , the slow - roll parameter @xmath6 , and the sound speed parameter @xmath7 , through the following relation @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pivot scale .",
    "the subscript @xmath11 denotes that the value of the hubble parameter is taken during the inflationary stage .",
    "the slow roll parameter @xmath6 is defined by @xmath12 where dots denote derivatives with respect to @xmath13 , and thus it is determined by the background dynamics of inflation .",
    "the sound speed parameter @xmath7 characterizes the propagation of primordial scalar fluctuations .",
    "theoretically , its value is constrained between @xmath14 and @xmath15 so that the model is free from the gradient instability and super - luminal propagation ( see however @xcite for a different viewpoint on super - luminal propagation of a k - essence field ) .",
    "moreover , the recent non - detection of the primordial non - gaussianity by the planck data  @xcite implies that @xmath7 can not be too small .",
    "the spectral index @xmath5 can be derived straightforwardly from its definition through @xmath16 where we have introduced two more slow - roll parameters , namely @xmath17 according to the current cmb observations , the spectral index @xmath5 takes a value which is slightly less than unity and hence the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is red - tilted .    for the primordial tensor fluctuations , the associated relations are even simpler if the gravity theory is still general relativity .",
    "the corresponding power spectrum takes the form of @xmath18 and therefore it is easy to see that the amplitude of the primordial tensor fluctuations only depends on the inflationary hubble parameter and the corresponding spectral index @xmath19 , where the latter , by definition , is given by @xmath20 expressions and are generic to any single field inflation model minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "since the hubble rate @xmath4 is monotonically decreasing in regular inflation models ( @xmath21 ) it is implied that @xmath22 , and hence one can conclude that the spectral index of the primordial tensor fluctuations @xmath19 in these models is always negative .",
    "therefore it is red - tilted too , as it is the case of the curvature perturbation .",
    "although the present observations can not determine the tilt of @xmath19 , we shall notice that if one expects a slightly blue power spectrum for the inflationary tensor fluctuations , @xmath6 has to be efficiently negative .",
    "this phenomenon implies a violation of weak / null energy condition during inflation . in the literature",
    "there have been some proposals to give rise to the corresponding energy condition violation in very early universe , namely super - inflation by the nonlocal gravity approach @xcite , super - inflation in loop quantum cosmology @xcite , inflation in ( super-)renormalizable gravity @xcite , as well as from a general viewpoint of effective field approach @xcite .",
    "however , it is not trivial to achieve an inflationary model that can realize @xmath22 in a stable way , without any pathologies , in the framework of einstein gravity . in particular",
    ", one ought to be aware of the following theoretical constraints :    * first of all , the model must be stable against any ghost mode , in order for the perturbation theory describing the primordial perturbations generated from vacuum fluctuations to be reliable .",
    "* the curvature perturbation must be free of the gradient instability , or at least experience this instability within a very short period . in this regard",
    ", there is no harmful growth of the primordial perturbations that might violate the current observational constraints .",
    "* the spacetime symmetry of the universe should recover the lorentz symmetry .",
    "this indicates that the theory of matter fields has to recover the canonical version , with all higher - order operators being suppressed at low energy scales . * after inflation , the universe needs to gracefully exit to the regular thermal expanding phase smoothly .",
    "hence it is implied that the weak energy condition has to be recovered at late times of the inflationary stage or after .",
    "keeping these theoretical requirements in mind , it is interesting to look for a viable inflation model that generates a power spectrum of the primordial tensor fluctuations with a blue tilt and is consistent with latest cosmological observations .",
    "this is exactly the goal of the present work .",
    "the violation of the weak energy condition in a stable way , is of theoretical interest in various models of very early universe physics",
    ". one plausible mechanism of achieving such a scenario is to make use of a ghost condensate field , in which the kinetic term for the inflaton takes a non - vanishing expectation value in the infrared regime @xcite .",
    "however , this type of models often suffers from a gradient instability , when the universe exits from the inflationary phase to the normal thermal expansion .",
    "another approach to realize the weak energy condition violation is to make use of a galileon - type field ( also dubbed as the horndeski field ) @xcite .",
    "the key feature of this type of field is that it contains higher - order derivative terms in the lagrangian , while the equations of motion remain second order and thus do not necessarily lead to the appearance of ghost modes .",
    "these important features have led to many recent studies of galileon models which yield a period of inflationary phase at early times of the universe  @xcite .    in this section , we focus on a class of inflation model with a horndeski operator .",
    "we phenomenologically consider a dimensionless scalar field @xmath23 with a lagrangian of the type @xmath24 in which @xmath25 is a k - essence type operator and @xmath26 is a horndeski operator .",
    "they both are functions of @xmath23 and the kinetic term @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the standard dalembertian operator .",
    "this type of lagrangian , with specifically chosen forms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , was adopted to drive the late - time acceleration of the universe in @xcite , and its dynamical analysis was carried out in @xcite .",
    "additionally , in @xcite it was found that if one combines the ghost condensate and horndeski operators he can obtain a healthy bouncing cosmology , with a smooth transition from a contracting universe to standard expanding radiation and matter dominated phases ( see also @xcite for extended studies ) .    to be specific , we choose the following _ minimal _ ansatz : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a dimensionless function of the inflaton field and @xmath31 is a coefficient as a free model parameter .",
    "note that the expression of @xmath25 in corresponds to the canonical lagrangian for the inflaton field .",
    "moreover , the horndeski operator @xmath26 is expected to stabilize the propagation of the curvature perturbation when the inflationary stage with @xmath32 occurs .",
    "its effect is automatically suppressed at low energy scales if we choose @xmath31 to be positive definite or @xmath30 to decay rapidly .",
    "consequently , the model under consideration could partly satisfy the theoretical limits pointed out at the end of the previous section .",
    "varying the lagrangian with respect to the metric , and focusing on a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry of the form @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the scale factor , leads to the friedmann equations @xmath35 where the energy density and the pressure of the scalar field respectively are written as @xmath36 + v(\\phi ) ~ , \\\\",

    "the coefficient @xmath40 is an effective friction term for the inflaton field .",
    "it is easy to check that the regular klein - gordon equation in a frw background can be recovered if one takes @xmath41 .",
    "finally , for completeness , in appendix [ appa ] we provide the cosmological equations for general @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in order to analyze the background dynamics it proves convenient to introduce various rolling parameters as : @xmath44 which are all dimensionless . note that the first two parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are mainly associated directly with the dynamics of the inflaton field . in traditional inflation models with a canonical kinetic term",
    ", they coincide with the regular slow - roll parameters @xmath6 and @xmath47 as provided in and .",
    "the last two parameters of @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively describe the first and second order variation of the coefficient @xmath50 within each hubble time . in summary , using these parameters one can rewrite the energy density and the pressure of the scalar field as @xmath51 ~ ,   \\\\",

    "however , in the general case the dynamics of @xmath50 can realize @xmath32 , despite the fact that @xmath55 . hence",
    ", the above model can indeed give rise to a blue tilt , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "in the rest of this work we study such a possibility .",
    "a general feature of cosmological scenarios which involve higher - order derivatives is that they can exhibit ghost instabilities at perturbation level , which can be treated in the context of an appropriate field redefinition @xcite .",
    "hence , before using for the description of the inflationary phase , one needs to perform a detail perturbation analysis and extract the necessary conditions for the avoidance of ghosts and gradient instabilities .",
    "following @xcite and applying the ansatzes of and , we deduce that in a frw background the condition for ghost absence writes as @xmath56 where @xmath57 \\ , ,   \\\\   w_3 & = -9{m_{\\rm pl}}^2h^2 + 3x \\left ( k_x + 2x k_{xx }",

    "in addition , the condition for the avoidance of gradient instabilities ( associated with the scalar field propagation speed ) reads @xmath59 note that the above two theoretical constraints can impose the bound of the parameters for inflation models in the literature directly . to be explicit , the condition for ghost absence requires that @xmath60 and the condition for the avoidance of gradient instabilities implies @xmath61 under the assumption of @xmath62 . as a result , the parameter space of inflation models that attempt to generate a blue spectrum of primordial gravitational waves could be strongly constrained by the above two theoretical requirements .",
    "furthermore , we would like to provide several examples of explicit inflation models , in order to demonstrate how these theoretical conditions can constrain the validity of these models .",
    "for instance , for a model of canonical inflation with @xmath41 , these two conditions are satisfied automatically , since @xmath63 exactly , however the spectrum of tensor modes is also red tilted ; moreover , if we consider an explicit model with @xmath64 and @xmath65 and take a positive value for @xmath66 , then the theoretical constrains yield approximately that @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for the latter case , there might exist possible parameter space that allows for a blue tilt for tensor modes , however , as will be shown in the following subsection , this possibility is unstable under the phase space analysis .",
    "we refer to appendix  [ appb ] for a specific instruction of the perturbation analysis for the inflation model under consideration .",
    "let us now apply the powerful method of dynamical analysis @xcite in order to investigate the general features of inflation in the scenario at hand . in order to perform such a stability analysis",
    "we first transform the cosmological equations in their autonomous form @xmath69 , where primes denote derivative with respect to @xmath70 , with @xmath71 a vector constituted by suitable auxiliary variables and @xmath72 the corresponding vector of the autonomous equations .",
    "the critical points @xmath73 of this autonomous system are extracted through the condition @xmath74 .",
    "their stability is examined by expansion around them as @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the vector of the variable perturbations , resulting to the perturbation equations of the form @xmath77 , with the matrix @xmath78 containing all the coefficients of these equations .",
    "therefore , the type and properties of a specific critical point are determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath78 : eigenvalues with positive real parts imply instability , eigenvalues with negative real parts imply stability , while eigenvalues with real parts of different sign correspond to a saddle point . in this way ,",
    "one is able to extract qualitative information for the global dynamics of the examined scenario , independently of the initial conditions and the specific universe evolution .",
    "we are interesting in analyzing the friedmann equations ( [ frw_eqs0 ] ) , along with the scalar field evolution equation ( [ scalarfieldeq ] ) . considering for simplicity the most important case where @xmath64 , we introduce the auxiliary variables @xmath79 in terms of these variables the first friedmann equation takes the form @xmath80 while from the definitions of @xmath81 and @xmath82 we acquire @xmath83 .    in order to proceed the analysis we have to consider ansatzes for the potential @xmath84 and the galileon coupling function @xmath30 . as a simple model we analyze the exponential potential @xmath85 which is widely used in the literature  @xcite , along with an exponential coupling function @xmath86 we comment that the specific forms considered above are very representative and can grasp common features obtained in other cases too .",
    "firstly , the exponential potential is one of the most representative ansatzes used in cosmology . in particular",
    ", this exponential potential possesses a manifest advantage that it can mimic any arbitrary cosmic evolution with a constant equation of state .",
    "additionally , it is well known that an exponential potential can yield an attractor solution .",
    "secondly , from the discussion performed below eq . , one can see that one important theoretical bound for @xmath50 is its positivity .",

    "we end the present paper by clarifying our motivation . in this paper",
    "we pointed out a theoretically severe problem .",
    "that is , given a possible detection of a blue spectrum for primordial tensor fluctuations , single field inflation models under our current knowledge can hardly provide a reasonable interpretation . to demonstrate this theoretical difficulty ,",

    "this issue might be circumvented by more complicated choices of the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but more problems associated with other instabilities / inconsistencies would appear , such as observational constraints of primordial non - gaussianities .",
    "we argue that , if the difficulty of realizing a blue tensor spectrum could eventually become a no - go theorem , then such a possible detection may spoil the picture of single field inflationary cosmology completely ; otherwise , a more delicate model building is required .",
