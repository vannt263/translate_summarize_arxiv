    "the lattice data on magnetic moments shown in figs.[fig : ab]-[fig : g ] have been obtained in the quenched approximation of qcd , i.e. with the ( loop- ) effects of sea quarks effectively suppressed . a fully consistent treatment of the chiral extrapolation",
    "should therefore be adapted to this situation , in the sense that the effects of quenching should also be taken into account appropriately within a chiral effective field theory .",
    "such a framework has been developed in the past decade , called quenched chiral perturbation theory ( qchpt ) @xcite .",
    "when performing chiral extrapolations of quenched lattice data , one does not only have to take into account that the prefactors of pion - mass dependent terms could be different in qchpt  even the chiral singularity structure can be different between `` quenched '' and `` full '' qcd . specifically , for the case of the nucleon magnetic moments @xcite of interest here , this means that there are terms proportional to @xmath19 which do not exist in `` full '' qcd .",
    "the chiral expansion of @xmath20 of eq.([eq : chiral ] ) demonstrates that the leading logarithmic pion - mass dependence is proportional to @xmath21 in `` full '' qcd .",
    "the presence of a new chiral singularity like @xmath19 in `` quenched '' qcd indicates that its low energy properties  not to speak of its chiral limit  can differ qualitatively from what we know in hadron phenomenology .    while `` quenched '' qcd is interesting in its own right , with the comments just made one might arrive at the pessimistic conclusion that not much can be learned about hadron properties in `` full '' qcd via extrapolations of quenched lattice data .",
    "however , the loop - effects of the sea - quarks  which are missing in `` quenched '' qcd get strongly suppressed for large quark masses , leading one to expect that `` quenched '' and `` full '' qcd do not differ much in the `` heavy quark regime '' .",
    "in addition , large quark masses mean that one is `` far away '' from chiral singularities which dominate the chiral limit behavior of the quantities of interest . for the time being we can therefore identify quenched lattice data approximately with `` full '' qcd _ for effective pion masses above 600 mev_. this assumption is further supported by three observations :    * available quenched lattice data on the magnetic moments of the nucleon for pion masses in the range 0.6 gev @xmath22 1.5 gev show a rather moderate curvature ( _ e.g. _ see fig.5 in ref.@xcite ) , suggesting a negligeable effect of the extra chiral singularity in this mass region . *",
    "the difference between the pade extrapolation curve eq.([eq : pade ] ) discussed in section [ pade ] and a similar formula that explicitly includes the leading effects of quenching has been reported to be small @xcite .",
    "for pion masses above 600 mev the two analyses lie within the error bars of the lattice data . *",
    "no significant differences between quenched and fully dynamical simulations for @xmath23 mev have been reported for a variety of nucleon structure properties , see for example the recent study of moments of nucleon quark distributions by the lhpc / sesam collaboration @xcite .",
    "in essence , while `` quenched '' qcd does have a chiral limit different from `` full '' qcd we can accept the given lattice data points for proton and neutron magnetic moments at @xmath23 mev as if they were `` unquenched '' , within their uncertainties . an extrapolation using standard ( rather than quenched ) effective chiral field theory seems therefore justified to provide the correct chiral extrapolation to small quark masses as well as the proper chiral limit , at least for our present purpose .",
    "the present analysis has pointed out the feasibility of systematic chiral extrapolations of nucleon magnetic moments from lattice qcd , down to the range of realistic light quark masses where comparisons with the actual observables can be made . an important element in this discussion",
    "is the treatment of the @xmath24(1232 ) isobar as an _ explicit _ degree of freedom in view of its important role in the magnetic structure of the nucleon . in our approach",
    "it is this feature which produces the important non - analytic quark mass dependencies of the magnetic moments _ beyond _ the well - known caldi - pagels term proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "our resulting extrapolation is remarkably close to the pade approximant parameterization of the adelaide group .",
    "a sign of caution should be added , however .",
    "the existing ( quenched ) data terminate around an effective pion mass of 0.65 gev , corresponding to @xmath25- and @xmath26-quark masses @xmath27 mev and larger .",
    "expanding one - loop chiral effective field theory to such large quark mass scales has its inherent uncertainties which induce a substantial error in the extrapolation down to small quark masses .",
    "in fact , it is rather surprising that our nlo extrapolation curve ends up near the physical value for @xmath20 , given that we only use the input from these rather large mass scales .",
    "certainly the n@xmath28lo corrections in schemes @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( as well as in the relativistic approach discussed in appendix [ b ] ) need to be analyzed systematically to judge the stability of the extrapolation @xcite .",
    "future ( partially ) unquenched lattice simulations aiming for effective pion masses around 300 mev are also expected to reduce the extrapolation uncertainties significantly . according to our results deviations from the nearly linear trend seen so far in the data below 1 gev pion mass",
    "should then become visible in the lattice data .",
    "however , extrapolating the results of such intermediate mass scale simulations down to the `` physical '' pion mass of 138 mev will presumably require precision calculations within ( partially ) quenched chiral effective field theories , in order to get control over the magnitude of the effects of ( partial ) quenching in the simulations .",
    "pioneering studies in this direction have already been performed and look promising @xcite .    as a final remark",
    "we note that future lattice simulations ( and the associated chiral extrapolations ) of magnetic moments and related nucleon properties should preferentially be done in the isovector / isoscalar basis , as the two channels show quite different patterns of quark mass dependence .    *",
