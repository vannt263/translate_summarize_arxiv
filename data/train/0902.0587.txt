    "these spirals are often complex interacting spirals with their trajectories pinned around non - excitable cells or regions .",
    "therefore , fragments are incident repeatedly at certain junctions and eventually only critical amounts of activator ( on the boundary between expansion and annihilation ) can cross these junctions .",
    "these critical excitation waves form as the refractory period of the junction is only fractionally longer than the period of rotation of the original spiral(s ) .",
    "critical excitation waves do not expand rapidly but instead drift across the cell . when they eventually expand they possess high curvature enabling them to curl back to form spirals trapped within excitable cells .",
    "wave curvature increases with excitability  @xcite and the core of a spiral wave decreases  @xcite .",
    "therefore , excitable cells in the network must possess a critical size and excitability in order for these spirals to form . if excitability is too high the initial waves are stable and no spirals form in the network",
    ". if excitability is too low , spirals can not form in excitable cells because wave curvature is too low .",
    "spirals trapped within excitable cells have a shorter period of rotation than the parent spirals . over time a number of these spirals form at various points in the network .",
    "this is because these spirals emit a proliferation of wave fragments meaning that the original mechanism of formation has an increased chance of being repeated .",

    "[ exp ] the junctions are relatively excitable and therefore , when a glider gun forms , gliders are emitted in all possible directions .",
    "so despite the periodic motion of the spiral , a super - critical amount of activator always reaches the junction and stable gliders form .    in experiment , if excitability levels are reduced further then wave transfer is generally unstable because of added heterogeneity ( gel imperfections , light dispersion etc . ) when compared to numerical studies . in numerical studies we were able to map all excitability levels where",
    "glider guns formed .",
    "glider guns that only emit wave fragments in selected directions were observed at lower excitability levels . in some cases glider guns fire intermittently into certain neighboring cells .",
    "this intermittent firing pattern can be explained by the periodic shift in rotation of the spiral ( fig .",
    "[ activator ] ) .",
    "these ` unstable ' glider guns are easier to fit into collision - based computational schemes as stable glider guns completely dominate network dynamics ( see sect .",
