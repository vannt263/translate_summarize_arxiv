    "a graph is determined by two finite sets , one set containing vertices and the other containing edges .",
    "each edge is incident on one or two vertices ; an edge incident on only one vertex is a loop .",
    "we think of an edge as consisting of two distinct half - edges , each of which is incident on precisely one vertex . in this paper",
    "we are especially interested in 4-regular graphs , i.e. , graphs in which each vertex has precisely four incident half - edges .",
    "the special theory of 4-regular graphs was initiated by kotzig and although his definitions and results have been generalized and modified over the years , most of the basic ideas of the theory appear in his seminal paper @xcite .",
    "matroids were introduced by  whitney @xcite , and there are several standard texts about them @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will only encounter binary matroids .",
    "if @xmath2 is a @xmath3-matrix with columns indexed by the elements of a set @xmath4 , then the binary matroid represented by @xmath2 is given by defining the rank of each subset @xmath5 to be equal to the dimension of the @xmath3-space spanned by the corresponding columns of @xmath2 .",
    "matroids can be defined in many other ways .",
    "in particular , the minimal nonempty subsets of @xmath4 that correspond to linearly dependent sets of columns of @xmath2 are the circuits of the matroid represented by @xmath2",
    ". we will not refer to matroid circuits often , to avoid confusion with the following definition .",
    "a circuit in a graph is a sequence @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ... , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 such that for each @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are half - edges of a single edge and @xmath17 and @xmath15 are both incident on @xmath18 .",
    "the half - edges that appear in a  circuit must be pairwise distinct , but vertices may be repeated .",
    "two circuits are considered to be the same if they differ only by a combination of cyclic permutations @xmath19 and reversals @xmath20 .",
    "notice that these definitions seem to be essentially non - matroidal : circuits may be nested , and distinct circuits may involve precisely the same vertices and half - edges , in different orders .",
    "for instance if a graph has one vertex @xmath21 and two edges @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( both loops ) , then it has four different circuits : @xmath21 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath21 ; @xmath21 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath21 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath21 ; @xmath21 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath21 , @xmath27 , @xmath26 , @xmath21 and @xmath21 , @xmath27 , @xmath26 , @xmath21 .",

    "we call such a triple a _ single transition_. kotzig called these triples transitions  @xcite , but we adopt the convention used by other authors ( including ellis - monaghan and sarmiento @xcite , jaeger @xcite and las vergnas @xcite ) that a _ transition _ consists of two disjoint single transitions at the same vertex .    a circuit partition ( or eulerian partition or @xmath31-decomposition ) of a 4-regular graph @xmath0 is a partition of @xmath32 into edge - disjoint circuits .",
    "these partitions were mentioned by kotzig @xcite , and since then it has become clear that they are of fundamental significance in the theory of 4-regular graphs .",
    "expanding on earlier work of martin @xcite , las vergnas @xcite introduced the generating function that records the sizes of circuit partitions of @xmath0 , and also the generating functions that record the sizes of directed circuit partitions of directed versions of @xmath0 ; he called these generating functions the martin polynomials of @xmath0 .",
    "a circuit partition of @xmath0 is determined by choosing one of the three transitions at each vertex , and jaeger @xcite used this fact in defining his transition polynomial , a form of the martin polynomial that incorporates transition labels .",
    "a labeled form of the martin polynomial was independently discovered by kauffman , who used it in his bracket polynomial definition of the jones polynomial of a knot or link @xcite .    for plane graphs , there is an indirect connection between martin polynomials and graphic matroids , introduced by martin @xcite and further elucidated by las vergnas @xcite and jaeger @xcite .",
    "( the corresponding result for the kauffman bracket is due to thistlethwaite @xcite . )",
    "the complementary regions of a 4-regular graph @xmath0 imbedded in the plane can be colored checkerboard fashion , yielding a pair of dual graphs with @xmath0 as medial ; the cycle matroid of either of the two dual graphs yields the martin polynomial of a directed version of @xmath0 .",
    "this indirect connection has been extended to several formulas , each time weakening the connection with matroids : jaeger extended it to include information from the undirected martin polynomial @xcite , las vergnas extended it to medial graphs in the projective plane and the torus @xcite , and ellis - monaghan and moffatt extended it to include medials in surfaces of all genera @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to introduce a more general connection between matroids and martin polynomials , which holds for all 4-regular graphs and does not require surface geometry .",
    "let @xmath0 be a 4-regular graph , and let @xmath33 be the set of transitions of @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath33 is partitioned into triples corresponding to the vertices of @xmath0 ; we call them the _ vertex triples _ of @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the set of transversals of the vertex triples , i.e. , subsets of @xmath33 that contain exactly one transition for each vertex of @xmath0 . then there is a bijection@xmath35 that assigns to a circuit partition @xmath36 the set of transitions involved in @xmath36 .",
    "[ tranmat]let @xmath0 be a 4-regular graph with @xmath37 connected components and @xmath38 vertices .",
    "then there is a rank-@xmath38 matroid @xmath1 defined on @xmath33 whose rank function extends a well - known formula : for each circuit partition @xmath36 of @xmath0 , the rank of @xmath39 in @xmath1 is given by @xmath40 here @xmath41 denotes the size of @xmath36 , i.e. , the number of circuits included in @xmath42    we call @xmath1 the _ transition matroid _ of @xmath0 , and we call the equation displayed in theorem [ tranmat ] the _ circuit - nullity formula_. ( the name may seem more appropriate after the formula is rewritten as @xmath43 : the number of extra  circuits in @xmath36 equals the nullity of @xmath39 . ) the formula has been rediscovered in one form or another many times over the years @xcite .",
    "what is surprising about theorem [ tranmat ] is not the circuit - nullity formula , but the fact that the formula can be extended to give well - defined ranks for arbitrary subsets of @xmath33 , including subsets not associated with circuit partitions in @xmath0 because they contain two transitions at some vertex , or none .",
    "we define @xmath1 in section 2 .",
    "the definition is not concise enough to summarize conveniently here , but we might mention that in the terminology of @xcite , @xmath1 is the isotropic matroid of the interlacement graph of any euler system of @xmath0 .",
    "notice the word any  in the preceding sentence : a typical 4-regular graph has many different euler systems , with nonisomorphic interlacement graphs ; but they all give rise to the same transition matroid .",
    "in section 3 we observe that the transition matroid of @xmath0 is closely related to the @xmath44-matroids and isotropic system associated to @xmath0 by bouchet @xcite .",

    "we discuss a theorem of ghier @xcite , a version of which was subsequently discovered independently by chmutov and lando @xcite .",
    "ghier s theorem implies that there are two fundamental types of interlacement - preserving operations , associated with edge cuts of size two or four .",

    "theorem [ iso ] is the analogue for transition matroids of whitney s famous characterization of graphs with isomorphic cycle matroids ( see chapter 5 of @xcite ) : connected sums are analogous to vertex identifications in disjoint graphs , separations are analogous to cutpoint separations , and balanced mutations are analogous to whitney twists .",
    "corollary [ isom ] is the analogue of a special case of whitney s theorem : 3-connected simple graphs are determined by their cycle matroids .    these analogies",
    "may be explained using an idea that appeared implicitly in jaeger s work @xcite and was later discussed in detail by bouchet @xcite . a circuit partition @xmath36 in a 4-regular graph @xmath0 has an associated touch - graph @xmath63 , which has a vertex for each circuit of @xmath36 and an edge for each vertex of @xmath0 ; the edge of @xmath63 corresponding to @xmath21 is incident on the vertex or vertices of @xmath63 corresponding to circuit(s ) of @xmath36 that pass through @xmath21 . in section 5 we  observe that connected sums , separations and balanced mutations of 4-regular graphs induce vertex identifications , cutpoint separations and whitney twists in touch - graphs .",
    "we also show that theorem [ tranmat ] implies the formula of las vergnas and martin for plane graphs that was mentioned above .    a parametrized tutte polynomial of a matroid @xmath2 on a ground set @xmath4 is a sum of the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the rank function of @xmath2 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 are weight functions mapping @xmath4 into some commutative ring .",
