    "a classic question in graph theory is : if a graph has chromatic number @xmath1 does the graph `` contain '' a complete graph on @xmath1 vertices in some way ?",
    "we know that the containment is not as a subgraph , just consider an odd cycle . in the 1940s hajs",
    "@xcite conjectured that the necessary containment was subdivision .",
    "a graph @xmath17 is a _ subdivision _ of a graph @xmath14 , if @xmath14 contains a subgraph which is isomorphic to a graph that can be obtained from @xmath17 by subdividing some of the edges .",
    "conjecture is true for @xmath18 @xcite , however , catlin  @xcite showed it is not true for @xmath19 by giving a family of counterexamples .",
    "hajs conjecture remains open for @xmath20 .",
    "another property to consider in trying to answer this question is graph minor .",

    "_ minor _ of a graph @xmath14 if a graph isomorphic to @xmath17 can be obtained from a subgraph of @xmath14 by contracting edges .",
    "we will say @xmath14 has a minor of @xmath17 . in 1943 , hadwiger  @xcite conjectured that every loopless @xmath1-chromatic graph has a minor of @xmath2 .",
    "hajs conjecture is true for @xmath18 , so hadwiger s conjecture is true for these values .",
    "wagner  @xcite showed that the @xmath21 case of hadwiger s conjecture is equivalent to the four color theorem , and robertson , seymour , and thomas @xcite proved the case when @xmath22 ; the cases @xmath19 are still open .",
    "given the difficulties in proving ( or disproving ) hadwiger s conjecture , we choose to explore a different type of containment , namely , graph immersion .",
    "the concept of immersion was introduced by nash - williams @xcite , as a weakening of graph subdivision , when he conjectured that for every countable sequence @xmath23 @xmath24 of graphs , there exist @xmath25 such that there is an immersion of @xmath23 in @xmath26 .",
    "this conjecture was proved by robertson and seymour in @xcite .",
    "the well - quasi - ordering of graphs by immersion has also been discussed in @xcite .",
    "immersions in digraphs have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , and immersion in other contexts can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",

    "it follows from the definition that if @xmath17 is immersed in @xmath14 , then the degree of any vertex in @xmath17 is less than or equal to its degree in @xmath14 , so in order for a @xmath1-chromatic graph , @xmath14 , to have an immersion of @xmath2 , @xmath14 must have at least @xmath1 vertices of degree at least @xmath4 . in 2003 ,",
