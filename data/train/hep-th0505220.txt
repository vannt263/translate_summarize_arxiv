    "d3 branes living at conical calabi - yau singularities are a good laboratory for the ads / cft correspondence since its early days .",
    "the world - volume theory on the branes is dual to a type iib background of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the horizon manifold @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between conical singularities and superconformal gauge theories has also given information on non - conformal ones .",
    "one of the few known examples of regular backgrounds dual to confining gauge theories , the klebanov - strassler solution @xcite , is indeed obtained by introducing fractional branes at a conifold singularity . in the conformal case , supersymmetry requires that @xmath3 is a sasaki - einstein metric . until few months ago , the only known sasaki - einstein metrics were the round sphere @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the horizon of the conifold .",
    "recently , an infinite class of new regular sasaki - einstein metrics with @xmath6 isometry was constructed @xcite .",
    "these manifolds are labeled by two integers @xmath7 and @xmath8 and have been named @xmath9 . with the determination of the corresponding dual gauge theory @xcite ,",
    "new checks of the ads / cft correspondence were possible @xcite .",
    "as well known , the central charge of the cft and the dimension of some operators can be compared with the volumes of @xmath3 and of some of its submanifolds . in particular",
    ", the a - maximization technique @xcite now allows for a detailed computation of the relevant quantum field theory quantities .",
    "needless to say , the agreement of the two computations is perfect .",
    "more recently , a generalization of the @xmath9 manifolds with smaller isometry @xmath10 and depending on three integers @xmath11 has been constructed @xcite .",
    "when @xmath12 and @xmath13 satisfy some conditions , these sasaki - einstein manifolds , named @xmath0 , are smooth . in this paper",
    ", we will construct the dual superconformal gauge theory , using a powerful method developed in @xcite .",
    "the precise correspondence between conical calabi - yau singularities and superconformal gauge theories is still unknown .",
    "however , a remarkable progress has been recently made for the class of gorenstein toric singularities .",
    "the brane tiling ( dimers ) construction @xcite , an ingenious generalization of the brane boxes @xcite , introduces a direct relation between an hanany - witten realization @xcite for gauge theory and the toric diagram . in particular , from the quiver associated with a superconformal gauge theory one can determine the dual brane tiling configuration , a dimer lattice .",
    "it is then possible to associate a toric diagram with each of these lattices , identifying the dual calabi - yau .",
    "the inverse process ( to associate a gauge theory with a given singularity ) is more difficult .",
    "hopefully , in the long period , the dimers technology will allow to define a one - to - one correspondence between cfts and toric singularities .",
    "for the moment , we will determine the superconformal gauge theory by using some analogy with the @xmath9 case .    to implement the dimer technology ,",
    "we need the toric description of the cone over the @xmath0 manifolds .",
    "the construction of the toric diagram for all integers @xmath11 and the toric description of the calabi - yau is described in the first part of this paper using results given in @xcite .",
    "we will also present explicit formulae for the volume of @xmath0 and the volumes of special submanifolds . with the knowledge of the toric diagram",
    ", we can engineer a dimer configuration that is general enough to contain all the infinite theories with diagram associated with the numbers @xmath11 .",
    "we are helped by the fact that the toric diagram has only four external vertices . in the second part of the paper ,",
    "we discuss the dual gauge theory .",
    "we compute the central charge and the dimensions of dibaryons using the a - maximization technique @xcite and we compare these results with the ads / cft predictions based on volumes .",
    "we find a complete agreement .",
    "even if expected , the agreement always contains a little bit of magic .",
    "in particular , we have two different algebraic procedures for computing the r - symmetry charges of the fields and the volumes .",
    "the first is based on the maximization of the central charge .",
    "the second one can be efficiently encoded in a geometrical minimization procedure for determining the reeb vector discovered in @xcite .",
    "the two procedures deal with different test quantities ( the r - charges on one side and the components of the reeb vector on the other ) and with different functions to be extremized .",
    "it is remarkable that the two methods give exactly equivalent results . in the case of @xmath0",
    "we are not able to analytically solve the extremization problems .",
    "fortunately , the two procedures can be easily automatized in mathematica .",
    "the numerical coincidence of the results for all @xmath11 is indeed impressive .",
    "notice that the agreement of results in the gauge theory and the supergravity side can be regarded not only as another non - trivial check of the ads / cft correspondence , but also as a check of the brane tiling construction @xcite .",
    "the latter is indeed still at the level of a conjecture .",
    "we are quite confident that the conjecture will become soon an established result and will lead to an important improvement of our knowledge in the field .",
    "we also discuss the inclusion of fractional branes . as usual",
    "this leads to a duality cascade .",
    "unfortunately , as in the @xmath9 case , it is most plausible that the theories associated with smooth @xmath0 have no supersymmetric vacuum .",
    "we briefly discuss the arguments leading to these conclusions @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ geometry ]",
    "we review the formulae for the metric of @xmath0 .",
    "section [ toric ] describes the toric geometry of the cones over @xmath0 determining the toric diagram .",
    "we also discuss the regularity of the metric for all values of @xmath11 using toric geometry .",
    "we set up a minimization problem for the determination of the reeb vector following the results in @xcite and we give closed expressions for the volume of the submanifolds associated with the edges of the toric fan . in section [ pregauge ] we discuss the tiling . in section [ gauge ]",
    "we describe the dual gauge theory and perform the a - maximization . in section",
    "[ fractional ] we discuss the inclusion of fractional branes in the game and the related duality cascade .",
    "finally , in the appendix we give details on the brane construction and provide specific examples .",
    "while finishing this work , a paper with partial overlap appeared @xcite .",
    "it also presents the central charge and the r - charges of fields .",
    "similar results have been obtained also in @xcite .",
    "recently a new infinite class of five - dimensional sasaki - einstein spaces was discovered @xcite .",
    "they were denoted @xmath0 . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review the geometry of these spaces . elaborating on @xcite",
    ", we give explicit formulae for the metric of these spaces and collect expressions that can be useful for the evaluation of volumes .",
    "our starting point is a set of d3-branes probing a cy conical singularity @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the transverse space is a cone with @xmath0 base @xmath14    the smooth @xmath0 spaces are characterized by three coprime positive integers @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the metrics have @xmath19 isometry enlarging to @xmath20 in the special case @xmath21 , which reduces to the previously - known spaces @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the topology of these spaces is @xmath23 .    for sasaki - einstein spaces",
    "one can write the local form of the metric as follows : @xmath24 in the case of the spaces @xmath0 @xmath25 where @xmath26    we can set one of the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 to any non - zero constant by rescaling the other two and @xmath30 .",
    "hence the metrics depend on two non - trivial parameters , which we will take to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the metrics are in general of cohomogeneity 2 , with toric principal orbits @xmath31 . in order to obtain metrics on",
    "complete non - singular manifolds we have to take the following range of variables : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the two lowest roots of @xmath36 .",
    "the ranges of the coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 as well as the toric @xmath40 action are described in the next section . in this range",
    "there are four degeneration surfaces respectively at @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 where , in order , the normalized four killing vectors vanish : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 notice that these quantities satisfy the equation @xmath48 to obtain a non singular manifold , we have to impose a linear relation among the killing vectors @xmath49 with @xmath50 four coprime integers with @xmath51 notice that all triples chosen from @xmath50 also are coprime . in order to have smooth geometry in 5-d the parameters need to obey @xmath52 with @xmath53 , which imply @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    if we set @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath57 @xmath59 it easy to see that the @xmath0 spaces reduce to the @xmath9 spaces with the relations : @xmath60 for reader convenience we exhibit the transformation laws that convert the metric to the one commonly used for the @xmath9 spaces : @xmath61 the @xmath0 metric indeed reduces to @xmath62 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that coincides with the @xmath63 metric with @xmath64 and @xmath65 related to @xmath29 by @xmath66    we can find expressions for @xmath67 , @xmath35 , @xmath68 , @xmath28 , in terms of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath69 . using the equations ( [ aibici ] , [ reldue ] ) and @xmath70 we obtain . ]",
    "@xmath71 with @xmath72 to find @xmath68 , @xmath28 we use the relations @xmath73 . by eliminating @xmath29 from the first relation we obtain @xmath74 and using now equation  ( [ x1 ] ) we find the quartic equation @xmath75 this can be solved to give a long expression for @xmath76 .",
    "if we use @xmath28 , @xmath29 as free parameters in the metric ( [ metrica ] ) we can set @xmath77 and so we have the expressions for @xmath67 , @xmath35 , @xmath68 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 in function of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath69 .",
    "we must verify that the solution of equation  ( [ quartic ] ) gives rise to positive definite metrics .",
    "this implies @xmath78 @xcite . using the metric ( [ metrica ] )",
    "it is easy to find the volume of the @xmath0 spaces @xmath79 each variable in ( [ volume ] ) is known as a function of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , if we like , we can write a ( very long ) closed equation for the volume in function of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 .",
    "in this section we build the toric diagram for the cy singularities with horizon @xmath0 .",
    "the impatient reader can find all the relevant information about the toric diagram in figure 1 .",
    "we also compute the volumes of special submanifolds of @xmath0 , using a method developed in @xcite .",
    "these results will be later compared with those of a - maximization .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review of all the necessary notions of toric geometry used in this section .      in the previous section we reviewed the local form of the metric of the calabi - yau cones over the sasaki - einstein spaces @xmath0 ; the toric action @xmath10 on such cones is locally given by the vectors fields : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite , on ( six dimensional ) symplectic toric cones @xmath83 we can define a moment map @xmath29 : @xmath84 whose image is a three dimensional strictly convex rational polyhedral cone @xmath85 ( the dual fan , in the language of toric geometry @xcite ) .",
    "moreover the original cy cone is reconstructed as a @xmath40 fibration over the polyhedral cone , with one or two cycles of the @xmath40 degenerating over faces or edges respectively of the dual fan . in our case , @xmath0 , we know that the image of the momentum map is a polyhedral cone with four faces , since there are only four subvarieties with a degenerating killing vector field @xcite .",
    "such divisors are the submanifolds at @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , with degenerating vectors given respectively by @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 in formula  ( [ uno ] ) . with the normalizations of the previous section",
    ", the orbits of these vector fields must be closed with period @xmath92 in order to avoid conical singularities when one approaches the faces of the polyhedral cone @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 fibered over the polyhedral cone is described locally by the coordinates ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , but we have not yet given a global description of the @xmath40 action and of the closed orbits .",
    "for example , we expect that in general the orbits of the reeb vector @xmath82 will not be closed except for the regular ( or quasi - regular ) case @xcite .",
    "the toric action can be described giving three identifications in the space ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) along three independent directions , or equivalently giving a basis of killing vectors @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 that describe an effectively acting @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 will be a linear combination of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and we understand that they are normalized such that their orbit is closed with period @xmath96 .",
    "of course any @xmath97 combination of the @xmath98 will also be a good basis ; as usual , the toric diagram is only defined up to @xmath97 transformations @xcite .",
    "notice that we are building the @xmath40 action so as to obtain a regular cy cone at @xmath99 .",
    "the degenerating vectors can be written as linear combinations of the @xmath98 : @xmath100    now notice that the four vectors orthogonal to the faces of the polyhedral cone are just the killing vectors that vanish on such faces @xcite ; the coordinates of such vectors in the basis @xmath98 are just the integers vectors in @xmath101 that describe the toric diagram ( fan ) . therefore in our notation",
    "the fan is simply generated by the four lines of the matrix @xmath102 . to avoid additional singularities the coefficients @xmath102 must be integers and each triple @xmath102 with fixed @xmath103 must be coprime , so that the fan is generated by primitive vectors .",
    "up to now there is only a possible ambiguity in the choice of signs for the vectors of the fan ; conventionally they are all inward pointing .",
    "we now use the fact that for a cy cone we can perform an @xmath97 transformation to set the first coordinate of the vectors of the toric diagram equal to one , that is @xmath104 .",
    "but then the requirement  ( [ reluno ] ) @xmath105 and the equality @xmath106 gives us the choice @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "at this point we can perform another @xmath97 transformation to set the remaining two components of , say , @xmath90 to @xmath109 .",
    "our matrix becomes : @xmath110    in the physics literature , it is common to give , instead of the three - dimensional vectors defining the fan , the toric diagram consisting in the projection of the vectors on the plane where they all live . in this case , the toric diagram is given by ignoring the first coordinate and consists of the points : @xmath109 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "let us study the smoothness of the cy cone .",
    "consider the face @xmath88 where @xmath90 degenerates ; the @xmath40 fibration over this face reduces to a @xmath114 fibration and the corresponding lattice is obtained by the lattice @xmath115 taking the quotient along the direction @xmath90 , which corresponds to @xmath93 .",
    "therefore over this face the @xmath114 lattice is simply the plane @xmath116 , and the projected vectors @xmath117 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 are @xmath112 , @xmath111 , @xmath113 .",
    "the face @xmath88 intersects also the two faces corresponding to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and to avoid conical singularities along the two edges where @xmath88 intersects these faces we must impose @xmath118 and @xmath119 . note that regularity does not require @xmath120 since obviously the divisor @xmath88 does not intersect @xmath89 .    since @xmath121 and @xmath122 are coprime , it is always possible to find an @xmath123 transformation that sends ( r , s ) in ( 1,0 ) . with this choice the two remaining components of equation ( [ linear ] ) read : @xmath124    we have to impose the regularity conditions at the two remaining edges of the the dual fan ; by taking the appropriate quotients along the degenerating directions in the lattice @xmath115 it is easy to derive the conditions @xmath125 and @xmath126 , together with the old one @xmath119 .",
    "indeed we have rederived the well known result in toric geometry that regularity is assured iff the four sides of the toric diagram @xmath109 , @xmath127 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 do not pass through integers points @xcite .",
    "let s choose @xmath50 coprime : we can always divide the defining equation ( [ linear ] ) by a possible common factor ; from @xmath106 it follows that every sub - triple of @xmath50 is coprime .",
    "then equation ( [ eq2 ] ) says that @xmath128 otherwise a common factor should also divide @xmath13 , and therefore also @xmath129 .",
    "but if @xmath16 and @xmath69 are coprime the general solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) is @xmath130 and @xmath131 with @xmath132 an arbitrary integer @xmath133 .",
    "let us concentrate on the `` minimal '' regular case @xmath134 : @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "the regularity condition @xmath119 is satisfied iff @xmath137 : suppose that there is an integer @xmath138 that divides @xmath16 and @xmath13 ; then by ( [ eq2 ] ) it divides also the product @xmath139 , but since it can not divide @xmath69 , it must divide @xmath140 .",
    "so @xmath138 would divide @xmath140 and @xmath136 .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "analogously it is straightforward to show , using ( [ eq2 ] ) , that the other regularity conditions are satisfied iff @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "we have to determine the two remaining parameters @xmath140 and @xmath143 in order to complete the description of the toric diagram . equation ( @xmath144 )",
    "has infinite solutions .",
    "in fact it is a well known result in linear diophantine equations that when @xmath128 equation ( [ eq2 ] ) always admits solutions , with the most general of the form : @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are particular solutions .",
    "there is not an explicit formula for @xmath146 and @xmath147 in terms of @xmath148 , but of course there is an algorithm to determine the solution given the inputs @xmath148 .",
    "the important point is that all the solutions ( [ diophantine ] ) describe the same toric geometry , since there is an @xmath149 transformation that sends a given solution @xmath109 , @xmath127 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 into any other of the family : @xmath152    to summarize , all the smooth @xmath0 are characterized by four coprime positive integers @xmath50 such that @xmath106 and @xmath153 ; remember also from the previous section that a positive definite and well defined metric requires @xmath154 .",
    "for this reason , in the following we will also denote these spaces with @xmath155 . under these conditions",
    "we can define periodicities to get a smooth cy cone with the `` minimal '' choice @xmath134 ; the toric diagram is given by the points @xmath156    ` ` + @xmath157 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi } & ( 1,0)\\\\[2em ] -l_2 & ( p , s)\\\\[2em ] \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\psi } & ( f , q ) \\end{array } \\nonumber\\ ] ]       .",
    "@xmath140 is typically negative and it will be renamed @xmath158 in the following .",
    "the toric diagram is given by the points @xmath159 .",
    "the explicit example in the figure is @xmath160 . ]    where @xmath140 and @xmath143 correspond to any solution of ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "in figure [ toricdia ] we present the case @xmath161 with @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "notice that in the case @xmath164 , when one gets the known case @xmath165 , ( [ eq2 ] ) has always the solution @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and the toric diagram @xmath109 , @xmath127 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , after a translation of @xmath170 and the @xmath149 transformation @xmath171 , can always be reduced to the standard form : @xmath109 , @xmath127 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",
    "we have made arbitrary choices in the previous analysis : for example one could have set the vectors corresponding to @xmath80 and @xmath117 equal to @xmath109 and @xmath127 respectively , obtaining the result in figure [ to2 ] .    ` ` + @xmath174 -l_2 & ( 1,0)\\\\[2em ] \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\psi } & ( a , p)\\\\[2em ] -l_1 & ( x , s ) \\end{array } \\nonumber\\ ] ]       .",
    "the explicit example is still @xmath160 .",
    "@xmath175 and @xmath176 satisfy the linear diophantine equation @xmath177    again in the figure we present the case @xmath160 ; obviously the toric diagram is equivalent to the previous one .",
    "there are other non `` minimal '' smooth cy cones over the spaces @xmath155 , that correspond to @xmath178 .",
    "notice that all these smooth cases can be obtained by the `` minimal '' ones by multiplying the ordinates of the vertices of the toric diagram by a factor @xmath132 : @xmath179 , @xmath180 .",
    "but now the request that the couples of integers @xmath12 and @xmath181 are pairwise coprime is no more sufficient to get a smooth manifold for a fixed @xmath132 : one should check that the sides of the toric diagram do not pass through integers points . for example multiplying by @xmath178 the toric diagram in figure 2 one never gets a smooth manifold .",
    "instead if we multiply the diagram in figure 1 by @xmath182 or @xmath183 @xmath184 we find a smooth manifold ( but not if n is divisible by 3 ) .",
    "notice also that starting from @xmath185 equivalent toric diagram and multiplying by @xmath132 one can get inequivalent diagrams , as in our example ( see also equation ( [ class ] ) ) .",
    "these non `` minimal '' cones are @xmath186 quotients of the `` minimal '' ones .",
    "we can also abandon the request that @xmath187 are coprime and rescale them by @xmath132 in the case of @xmath186 quotients , so that we can continue to use the equations @xmath136 and @xmath135 in any case .",
    "this will be understood in the following .",
    "to finish this discussion , we notice that in describing the gauge theory we can always choose @xmath188 , at least in smooth cases .",
    "if not so , we can exchange @xmath13 with @xmath69 : this does not change the geometry and therefore does not change the gauge theory .",
    "in fact it is easy to check that the toric diagrams for @xmath155 and @xmath189 are the same up to an @xmath185 transformation : start with the points @xmath109 , @xmath127 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 with @xmath143 and @xmath140 satisfying @xmath192 .",
    "then apply the transformation : @xmath193 where we can choose the integers @xmath194 and @xmath30 to be solutions of @xmath195 ( note in fact that @xmath196 in smooth cases ) .",
    "the resulting toric diagram is @xmath109 , @xmath127 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 with @xmath199 and @xmath194 satisfying : @xmath200 .",
    "we have therefore exchanged the role of @xmath13 and @xmath69 .",
    "analogously , when @xmath201 , it is easy to show that it is possible to exchange the pair @xmath202 with the pair @xmath203 : we have to add @xmath170 to the points of the toric diagram @xmath109 , @xmath127 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 and then apply the transformation @xmath206 .",
    "one gets the diagram : @xmath109 , @xmath127 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , where now @xmath207 and @xmath208 satisfy the relation : @xmath209 , thus exchanging the role of @xmath202 and @xmath203 . note that we have used transformations with determinant @xmath210 ; moreover we expect the changes of coordinates realizing these symmetries to be non trivial .    in conclusion we can choose @xmath211 without loss of generality .",
    "this ordering will always be understood in the following .",
    "recall that the sasaki - einstein metrics are associated with a specific vector field , the reeb vector . using the local form of the metric  ( [ metrica ] )",
    ", it can be identified with @xmath212 . in @xcite",

    "one is able to compute the reeb vector and the volume of a sasaki - einstein metric on the base of a toric cy cone using only the data of the toric diagram , without knowing the explicit form of the metric .",
    "we can expand the reeb vector of a sasakian manifold in the basis of vectors @xmath98 that generate the @xmath40 effective action @xmath213 since in @xcite it was shown that we can always set @xmath214 , we can regard @xmath215 as the vector @xmath216 .",

    "the important result of @xcite is that one can find the value of @xmath220 by extremizing the volume function : @xmath230 it is possible to show that there is always only one critical point of @xmath231 in the dual cone @xmath232 .",
    "we can write the function @xmath231 in the case of the @xmath0 spaces .",
    "the four vectors @xmath217 for the case of @xmath0 have been determined in the previous subsection : @xmath233 where @xmath138 and @xmath143 are determined by the diophantine equation @xmath234 for a better comparison with the gauge theory section we have renamed @xmath235 . with these values",
    "we obtain @xmath236    the minimization of this function gives algebraic equations for the determination of @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
