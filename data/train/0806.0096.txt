    "quantum mechanics is inherently nonlocal , clearly demonstrated by the fact that measurements on quantum states may violate the so - called bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "this has been verified experimentally as well , up to some technical loopholes @xcite . on the other hand , when a quantum state can not be prepared using only local operations and classical communication , it possesses quantum correlations and we say that the state is entangled .",
    "it was werner who asked firstly what the relation is between quantum nonlocality and quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "it is actually known that any pure entangled state of two or more subsystems may violate a generalized bell inequality @xcite , thus here nonlocality and entanglement coincide . for mixed states , however , the relation between entanglement and nonlocality is much complicated . in 1989",
    "werner @xcite constructed a family of bipartite mixed states ( became known as werner states ) , which , while being entangled , yield outcomes that admit a local hidden variables ( lhv ) model .",
    "this conclusively proved that entanglement and nonlocality are different resources .    however",
    ", if we want to describe quantitatively the difference , the picture turns out to be quite subtle even in the case of two - qubit werner states , which are mixtures of the singlet @xmath3 with white noise of the form @xmath4 werner showed @xcite that these states are separable if and only if @xmath5 . with respect to the locality properties , on one hand ,",
    "werner states admit a lhv model for all measurements for @xmath6 @xcite and admit a lhv model for projective measurements for @xmath7 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "werner states violate the chsh inequality for @xmath8 , in which case lhv model clearly can not be constructed .",
    "it is not known whether werner states admit an lhv model in the region @xmath9 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath10 where the state ceases to be nonlocal , designated @xmath11 , is particularly relevant from the viewpoint of experiments since this value specifies the amount of noise the singlet tolerates before losing its nonlocal properties .",
    "this issue was addressed by gisin some time ago @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who posed the question to find bell inequalities which are more efficient than the chsh one for werner states . in this paper",
    "we intend to give a definite answer to this question by providing bell inequalities which can be violated slightly stronger than the chsh one , resulting in the bound @xmath12 for the nonlocality visibility threshold ( instead of the bound @xmath13 owing to the chsh inequality ) .",
    "note , how powerful the chsh inequality is , which is the simplest bell inequality , consisting of two settings on each side , while a stronger bell inequality presented in this work has at least 465 settings on each side .",
    "we also would like to point out that while in certain cases using sequence of measurements may extend the range of locality @xcite , the nonlocality threshold @xmath11 for werner states could not be decreased even on this way @xcite .",
    "there is also an interesting line of research , which explores the parameter region of bell violation for werner states by restricting the class of possible lhv models @xcite .",
    "actually , ref .",
    "@xcite could achieve violation of certain bell inequalities , assuming the above limitations for @xmath14 , i.e. , for the entire range of the nonseparability region .",
    "an other way of generalization to obtain the range of locality is the extension of the werner states to e.g. , more parties @xcite or higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , let us mention , that a gap also remained in these cases between the best known local model @xcite and the proven nonlocality threshold @xcite .",
    "the outline of the present work is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ bellgroth ] we briefly summarize the relation between bell inequalities for two - qubit werner states and grothendieck constant of order 3 , denoted by @xmath15 . in sec .",
    "[ cons ] a family of bell inequalities is constructed and in sec .",
    "[ lower1 ] with the aid of these inequalities a lower bound , bigger than @xmath16 , is given for @xmath15 , implying that werner states ( [ werner ] ) with @xmath17 can still violate these inequalities . in sec .",
    "[ lower2 ] we give a better lower bound for @xmath15 and for higher orders ( @xmath18 with @xmath19 ) , as well . in sec .",
    "[ other ] a bell inequality is provided with a number of settings 11 and 14 , proving @xmath20 , and in sec .",
    "[ tight ] the relevance property of the constructed family of bell inequalities is demonstrated .",
    "[ disc ] summarizes and poses some open questions .",
    "define the expression @xmath21 where @xmath22 is any @xmath23 matrix with real entries and @xmath24 .",
    "now let us define @xmath25 where the unit vectors @xmath26 are in @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the dot product of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "grothendieck constant plays a prominent role in the theorem of linear operators on banach spaces @xcite .",
    "grothendieck constant of order @xmath31 , designated @xmath18 , for any integer @xmath32 , can be defined as @xcite @xmath33 for all unit vectors @xmath26 in @xmath27 and for all @xmath34 matrix @xmath22 .",
    "the constant @xmath18 is taken to be the smallest possible one .",
    "now let us discuss briefly the connection with bell inequalities . in the bell scenario we consider two parties , alice and bob , each chooses from @xmath35 @xmath36-valued observables , specified by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the joint correlation of alice and bob s measurement outcomes , designated @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the density matrix of the bipartite state .",
    "a correlation bell inequality can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 signifies the bound which can be achieved by local models and @xmath22 is a @xmath34 matrix with real coefficients defining a bell inequality .",
    "the local bound can always be achieved by a deterministic local model , i.e. , for all real numbers @xmath45 we have @xmath46 in this way the expression @xmath47 defined by ( [ lhv ] ) is linked to a correlation bell inequality with matrix @xmath22 and local bound @xmath48 .    on the other hand , for the singlet state @xmath49 we have @xmath50 , where the observables @xmath51 and @xmath52 corresponding to alice and bob s projective measurements are specified by the unit vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath53 . then substituting into ( [ bell ] ) one obtains the expression @xmath54 in ( [ quantum ] ) .",
    "furthermore , tsirelson @xcite proved that correlations which are dot products of unit vectors @xmath55 can always be realized by performing projective measurements on maximally entangled states in some higher dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "thus the value @xmath56 can always be achieved by means of quantum mechanics .",
    "since joint correlations vanish for the maximally mixed state , it follows that the critical point at which werner states in ( [ werner ] ) cease to violate any bell inequality is @xmath57 .",
    "this key correspondence has been established in ref .",
    "though , the exact value of @xmath15 is not known , but known bounds establish that @xmath58 . in this paper",
    "we show that @xmath59 implying the slightly smaller gap @xmath60 .",
    "let us mention , that the fishburn - reeds bell inequality @xcite provides an explicit example with 20 settings on each side showing that @xmath61 .",
    "also toner has shown that @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "but , as far as we know , the question has remained open whether @xmath15 is bigger than @xmath16 implying @xmath62 .",
    "for bell diagonal states , such as for werner states , under projective measurements alice and bob s local marginals ( defined by @xmath63 for alice and likewise for bob ) are zero , thus it is sufficient to deal with generic correlation bell inequalities defined by ( [ bell ] ) to obtain maximal bell violation for werner states .",
    "moreover , in this respect , the tight correlation bell inequalities , which can be considered as facets of the correlation polytope @xcite , specified by the number of two - outcome measurements @xmath35 on each side , are the most efficient ones . for",
    "@xmath64 one obtains as the only nontrivial correlation inequality the chsh one @xcite . for @xmath65",
    "one needs to resort to numerical programs for computing the inequalities corresponding to the inequivalent facets of the correlation polytope . up to @xmath66 all the correlation inequalities",
    "have been computed @xcite , and the two inequivalent inequalities obtained are in fact less efficient than the chsh one for werner states",
    ". however , the complexity of the computation exponentially grows with @xmath35 ( in fact , this is an np - complete problem @xcite ) , therefore there is no hope to completely characterize all the facets of the correlation polytope for any given @xmath35 .",
    "thus in general one needs to look for alternative methods .",
    "for instance gisin explored special form of families of tight correlation inequalities , the so - called @xmath67-inequalities in ref .",
    "avis et al .",
    "@xcite applied triangular elimination to the list of known facet inequalities of the cut polytope to construct many new tight correlation inequalities .",
    "alternatively , one can construct ( possibly not tight ) correlation inequalities which however can be easily generalized to arbitrary number of settings , such as in the cases @xcite . in the present work we have chosen this latter direction by modifying the correlation inequalities @xmath68 introduced in @xcite .",
    "let us specify the form of @xmath22 in ( [ lhv ] ) through the following formula , @xmath69 entailing a bell inequality with @xmath70 and @xmath71 measurement settings on alice and bob s respective side .",
    "first we calculate the maximum achievable value ( local bound ) for it . for this sake , we can write for the maximum @xmath72 generally , the local bound can be obtained by finding the maximum over all possible values @xmath45 . however , in this particular case one can exploit the symmetry with respect to change of indices within the sets @xmath73 and @xmath74 . thus one needs to check altogether @xmath75 cases where @xmath76 occurs @xmath77 times in the set @xmath73 and @xmath76 occurs @xmath78 times in the set @xmath79 ( the rest being @xmath80 ) . for any @xmath81 pair we have @xmath82",
    "this expression is maximal by @xmath83 resulting in the local bound @xmath84    in this paper we focus on two particular cases @xmath85 and @xmath86 , but first let us restrict our attention to the latter , symmetric case @xmath87 .",
    "the lhv bound gives @xmath88 by inserting @xmath87 in ( [ localmax ] ) . on the other hand , the expression @xmath89 , symmetric in the two parties ,",
    "reads @xmath90 for the maximum , similarly to the lhv case , the two - indices terms can be omitted : @xmath91 where the maximization is over all @xmath92 and the last inequality comes from the relation between the geometric and quadratic mean .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath93 and @xmath94 do not depend on each other , one can maximize the two sets independently resulting in @xmath95 with the constraints @xmath96 , where the equality sign is due to the fact that at the maximum one can take @xmath97 for all @xmath98 , which saturates the inequality in ( [ maxidnn ] ) .",
    "this expression shows some similarity with the one appearing in @xcite , in which case one had to maximize only the last term , i.e. , the sum of distances of @xmath99 unit vectors . this is a problem occurring in discrete mathematics , and there exist optimal solutions for various instances of the values @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the present case , the quadratic term makes things complicated to get the true optimum value .",
    "however , due to formula  ( [ groth ] ) one can give the lower bound @xmath101 for the grothendieck constant of order d , without knowing the true maximum value @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , in the particular case @xmath103 one can obtain the exact maximum , @xmath104 .",
    "this result ( noticing that for large @xmath99 the violation tends to @xmath105 ) would indicate that there may be some hope to get a lower bound @xmath106 .",
    "below we show that the maximum above can indeed be attained .",
    "first let us observe that in ( [ maxidnn2 ] ) only @xmath99 vectors occur , thus we have @xmath107 with @xmath108 , where @xmath35 is the number of measurement settings on each side .",
    "now we take the unit vectors @xmath109 in such a way that @xmath110 for all @xmath111 .",
    "this can be achieved , by noting that the @xmath112 gram matrix @xmath113 , defined by elements @xmath114 is positive definite , and every positive definite matrix is a gram matrix for some set of vectors . thus it is enough to show that the gram matrix @xmath113 , defined as above ( @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) , is positive definite . however , using the sylvester criterion @xcite one can establish that @xmath113 defined above is positive definite iff @xmath117 for any @xmath99 .",
    "one may obtain by induction the closed formula @xmath118 for the determinant of any @xmath112 matrix @xmath119 having in the diagonals the value @xmath120 and in all off - diagonals the value @xmath121 . by choosing particularly @xmath122 and @xmath123 one",
    "gets @xmath117 for any dimension @xmath99 , which proves our assertion .    beside , all the elements in ( [ maxidnn2 ] ) can be obtained as the only function of @xmath124 , since @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "thus by substitution we obtain @xmath127 .",
    "then it follows using ( [ localmax ] ) , that @xmath128 .",
    "it is also possible to verify that this is in fact the maximum value .",
    "the verification , which is not detailed here , goes the same line as discussed by wehner in @xcite for the chained bell inequality @xcite through the dual solution of a semi - definite optimization problem @xcite .",
    "note that this optimization problem is just the first step in the hierarchy introduced by navascues et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we wish to obtain a lower bound @xmath129 bigger than @xmath16 for the grothendieck constant of order 3 , @xmath15 . since owing to ( [ localmax ] ) , @xmath88 , we are left with the calculation of @xmath130 which though might be not maximal , but large enough to supply a good lower bound for @xmath15 .",
    "this is achieved by substituting in ( [ maxidnn2 ] ) in the place of @xmath109 explicit values on the following way .",
    "since @xmath109 are unit vectors in @xmath53 , the first two components @xmath131 of @xmath109 , which can be considered as points in the @xmath132-plane , completely specify the vector itself .",
    "let @xmath133 and distribute these points on three co - centric circles centered at the origin @xmath134 with radii @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "then let @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 . the other @xmath141 vectors are constructed from the above vectors by rotating them with angles @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , respectively , such as to form regular polygons with vertices 4 , 10 and 16 ( as it is shown in the figure ) . by inserting the explicit values of the corresponding set @xmath145 into the expression to be maximized in ( [ maxidnn2 ] ) one obtains @xmath146 with @xmath133 .",
    "this implies that @xmath15 is indeed bigger than @xmath147 .",
    "the specific values of @xmath109 have been found by performing optimization with respect to the radii of the three circles by choosing regular polygons with various number of vertices .     on the @xmath132-plane .",
    "they are equally distributed on three co - centric circles with radii @xmath148 centered at the origin .",
    "the outer circle represents the grand circle projected on the @xmath132-plane , thus having radius 1 .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "in this section a general method is discussed to obtain local maximum on @xmath149 for any @xmath100 , which for many instances are presumably the global or close to the global maximum .",
    "then , recalling @xmath150 and @xmath151 , this method yields lower bounds for @xmath18 .",
    "in particular we present results for @xmath152 , calculated by the value @xmath153 .",
    "let us consider the following iteration scheme , which is a simplified version of the see - saw iteration method , already used in the literature to solve optimization problems in similar context entering many optimization parameters @xcite .",
    "note , that the matrix @xmath22 of @xmath154 defined through ( [ inanb ] ) is symmetric , thus we may write @xmath155 with @xmath108 and @xmath156 are unit vectors in @xmath27 . in this notation",
    "we contracted the double indices @xmath157 appearing in ( [ idnn ] ) , so that @xmath158 stands for the set @xmath159 and similarly for the vectors @xmath30 .    considering ( [ seesaw ] ) one can maximize the expression @xmath149 for given @xmath158 by setting @xmath160 parallel to @xmath161 for all @xmath98",
    ". then one can continue with setting @xmath109 parallel to @xmath162 for all @xmath98 . however , due to the fact that @xmath22 is symmetric , one can get rid of the vectors @xmath30 and obtain the iteration rule @xmath163 for all @xmath98 , provided @xmath164 .",
    "here the notation @xmath165 refers to the euclidean norm of a vector @xmath166 .",
    "thus our task is to give initial values for the unit vectors @xmath167 , which we choose in the following way .",
    "the surface of the unit sphere in @xmath27 can be parameterized by @xmath168 angles , @xmath169 @xmath170 .",
    "we define the starting vectors @xmath158 with angles @xmath171,\\ ; 1\\le k\\le d-1 $ ] .",
    "then we perform the above iteration scheme for a given time , practically till the vectors @xmath109 in two successive iteration steps differ less than an infinitesimal threshold value .",
    "in particular , for @xmath153 we found that @xmath172 iteration steps were sufficient for our purposes . also , we checked for each case @xmath152 , that the value @xmath173 in the denominator of the iterated expression was nonzero ( actually , it was no less than @xmath174 for all @xmath98 in each case of @xmath31 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the iteration was performed with machine precision @xmath175 in the mathematica package , and we checked that @xmath176 for all @xmath177 after the @xmath172 iteration steps completed .    for @xmath153 , we obtained the following numbers , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 .",
    "these numbers are lower bounds for the grothendieck constants @xmath15 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively .",
    "we mention that for @xmath153 the dimension of the respective matrix @xmath22 is @xmath183 .",
    "note that the best lower bound for @xmath182 presented so far in the literature @xmath184 comes from the fishburn - reeds inequality @xcite .",
    "our result for @xmath15 provides us with the better lower bound @xmath185 for the critical value @xmath11 owing to the formula @xmath186 .",
    "one may also ask , what is the smallest number of settings on alice and bob s side , where @xmath18 can exceed @xmath16 for some @xmath187 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "so far it has been provided by the fishburn - reeds inequalities @xcite .",
    "their construction , giving @xmath184 can be obtained by 20 measurement settings on each side .",
    "now we choose @xmath188 in expression @xmath189 of ( [ inanb ] ) , giving the number of settings 11 and 14 on alice and bob s side , respectively .",
    "thus the matrix @xmath22 in this particular instance has dimensions @xmath190 .",
    "we show that this expression @xmath191 provides us with an example where @xmath20 .",
    "substituting values @xmath192 and @xmath193 into the formula ( [ localmax ] ) for odd @xmath194 one obtains the value 20 for the local bound . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum value corresponding to the vectorial case @xmath195 , can be obtained by the mean of semidefinite techniques @xcite as a first step of the hierarchy in @xcite , where we used the sedumi package @xcite for matlab by the explicit numerical computation .",
    "this algorithm solves both the primal and the dual optimization problem at the same time and thus yields bounds on the accuracy of the obtained solution as well .",
    "actually , we obtained the same optimal value @xmath196 for both cases .",
    "this yields the ratio @xmath197 for the violation of the bell inequality @xmath198 clearly beating the @xmath16 limit with 11 and 14 settings on alice and bob s side , respectively .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether the family of correlation inequalities defined by ( [ inanb ] ) is tight , i.e. , whether it is a facet or not of the local bell polytope @xcite consisting of local marginals as well .",
    "this can be done by computing the dimension of the subspace spanned by all deterministic strategies saturating the inequality .",
    "if this subspace is found to be a hyperplane with dimension @xmath199 , then the inequality is tight .",
    "numerically , we treated the @xmath85 and @xmath87 cases in the expression @xmath189 .",
    "computationally we found that in the former case the inequality is tight up to @xmath200 . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter symmetric inequality proved to be not tight , but by the addition of some local terms @xmath45 as follows , @xmath201 we checked computationally its tightness up to @xmath202 .",
    "note , that here the terms @xmath203 refer to alice and bob s local marginals in the corresponding bell inequalities .",
    "recalling from sec .",
    "[ cons ] , that for @xmath86 we have @xmath204 , by adding the marginals @xmath205 , thus the local bound does not change .",
    "let us notice , that @xmath206 specified by @xmath207 in ( [ symmod ] ) is just the @xmath208 bell inequality @xcite , which is known to be tight @xcite . in both cases , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , we suspect that these bell inequalities are tight for any higher values of @xmath211 , as well .",
    "let us discuss the concept of relevant bell inequalities , whose definition we quote from @xcite , sec .",
    "a.1 : `` an inequality is relevant with respect to a given set of inequalities if there is a quantum state violating it , but not violating any of the inequalities in the set . '' collins and gisin @xcite showed that the @xmath208 inequality is relevant to the famous chsh inequality @xcite .",
    "interestingly , they also found that given @xmath208 the chsh inequality is no longer relevant .",
    "furthermore , ito , imai and avis @xcite have recently conjectured supported by numerical optimization , that there exist bell inequalities relevant for the @xmath208 inequality for 3-level isotropic states .",
    "however , limiting the hilbert space dimension to a qubit pair , they did not find a bell inequality which would be relevant with respect to @xmath208 .",
    "our new inequalities , @xmath154 and @xmath210 with @xmath153 , however , are examples to this latter case , demonstrating that in the parameter range @xmath212 two - qubit werner states do not violate the @xmath208 inequalities but violate @xmath154 or @xmath210 for @xmath213 ( note that for the werner states the local marginals become identically zero , thus in this respect @xmath154 and @xmath210 are equivalent ) .",
    "moreover , one can demonstrate , that there is an inclusion relation , a notion introduced in @xcite , between @xmath210 and @xmath214 , meaning that one can obtain the inequality @xmath214 by measuring the identity for some settings in the inequality @xmath210 ( i.e. , performing degenerate measurements ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath210 for any @xmath215 is relevant with respect to @xmath216 .",
    "the proof is simple , actually by setting @xmath217 and @xmath218 for @xmath219 in @xmath210 one obtains @xmath214 , and then by induction one arrives at @xmath206 .",
    "altogether , one can say that if one limits the hilbert space dimension to two qubits ( @xcite , sec .",
    "a.2 ) the @xmath210 inequality for @xmath220 is the only relevant one with respect to all presently known bell inequalities .",
    "we provided a new family of bell inequalities which proves that werner states in ( [ werner ] ) are nonlocal for the parameter range @xmath221 , the best earlier result @xmath222 is given by the chsh inequalities .",
    "some of these bell inequalities are shown to be relevant with respect to any other known bell inequality .",
    "our results have been obtained by proving that the grothendieck constant of order 3 , @xmath15 , is bigger than @xmath16 , in particular , @xmath59 .",
    "though our result for the wider visibility range of nonlocal werner states has been obtained for a number of settings ( at least 465 for each party ) which are not particularly suited for experiments , we believe that they are interesting from a conceptual point of view .",
    "entangled states in many quantum information protocols ( for instance in quantum communication complexity @xcite and device - independent quantum key distribution problems @xcite ) give advantage over there classical counterparts only if they exhibit nonlocal correlations . thus , in this paper we have shown that this nonlocal correlation can in principle be exploited in a wider range of werner states .",
    "we leave it as an open question how to construct even better inequalities which would allow to beat the @xmath16 limit of @xmath15 stronger . the possibility for such inequalities",
    "is suggested by the fact that an upper bound for @xmath223 is @xmath224 which is suspected to be tight @xcite .",
    "but the inequality @xmath154 for @xmath220 gives the lower bound @xmath105 for @xmath225 , which is even smaller than the lower bound 1.6770 for @xmath225 presented in ref .",
    "thus it is not impossible that there exist inequalities providing bigger values for @xmath15 entailing even better bell inequalities than the present ones for werner states .",
