    "the study of the survival probability @xmath0 of large rapidity gaps ( lrg ) is currently a subject of intense theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "its importance lies in the fact that systematic analyses of lrg open the possibility of extracting new physics from hard diffractive processes . on the theoretical side ,",
    "its significance is due to the reliance of the @xmath0 calculation on subtle qcd methods .",
    "rapidity gaps are defined as regions of angular phase space devoid of particles @xcite , and at high - energy hadron - hadron collisions it has been suggested that their observation may serve as a signature for production of higgs bosons and other colour - singlet systems via fusion of electroweak bosons @xcite . however , as pointed out by bjorken @xcite , we are not able to distinguish between the theoretically calculated rate of a large rapidity gap , @xmath5 , and the actual measured rate , @xmath6 .",
    "these rates are related by the proportionality relation @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the so called `` survival probability '' of a large rapidity gap : it gives the probability of survival of lrg and not the probability for the production _ and _ survival of lrg , which is the quantity actually measured .",
    "more specifically , the survival factor @xmath0 gives the probability of a large rapidity gap not to be filled by debris originated from the rescattering of spectator partons ( @xmath8 ) , or from the emission of bremsstrahlung gluons from partons ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "hence we can write @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the rapidities of the jets ( produced with large transverse momenta ) , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the square of the total center - of - mass ( cm ) energy .",
    "the factor @xmath15 , which depends on the value of the lrg as well as on the kinematics of each specific process , can be calculated using perturbative qcd @xcite . on the other hand , the survival factor @xmath8",
    "can not be calculated perturbatively : it takes account of soft rescatterings in both the initial and final state interactions . to calculate",
    "@xmath8 we need to obtain the probability of the two incoming hadrons do not interact inelastically , i.e. the probability of large rapidity gaps do not be populated by additional hadrons produced from the rescattering of spectator degrees of freedom .",
    "as discussed by gotsman , levin and maor some time ago , this task is a difficult one since partons at long distances contribute to such a calculation @xcite . however , the survival probability can be properly defined in the impact parameter space @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the impact parameter , @xmath18 is a factor related to the overlap of the parton densities in the colliding hadrons in the transverse impact plane , and @xmath19 is the probability that the two incoming hadrons have not undergone a inelastic scattering at the parton level .",
    "the above definition sets up the stage for carrying out a systematic computation of @xmath8 , since the probability @xmath19 can be easily obtained , for example , from the qcd - inspired eikonal approach @xcite . in this picture the probability that neither hadron is broken up in a collision at impact parameter @xmath17 is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the imaginary part of the eikonal function . in qcd - inspired eikonal models",
    "the increase of the total cross sections is associated with semihard scatterings of partons in the hadrons , and the high energy dependence of the cross sections is driven mainly by gluon - gluon scattering processes . nevertheless , the gluon - gluon subprocess cross section is potentially divergent at small transferred momenta , and the usual procedure to regulate this behaviour is the introduction of a purely _ ad hoc _ parameter separating the perturbative from the non - perturbative qcd region , like an infrared mass scale @xcite , or a cut - off at low transverse momentum @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "recently we introduced a qcd - based eikonal model where the _ ad hoc _ infrared mass scale was substituted by a dynamical gluon mass one @xcite .",
    "one of the central advantages of the model is that it gives a precise physical meaning for the quoted infrared scale .",
    "furthermore , since the behaviour of the running coupling constant is constrained by the value of dynamical gluon mass @xcite , the model also has a smaller number of parameters than similar qcd models .    in this letter",
    "we perform a detailed computation of the survival probability in @xmath23 and @xmath24 channels in the framework of the qcd eikonal model with a gluon dynamical mass . we are concerned with the calculation of @xmath25 , the probability that lrg survive the soft rescattering of spectator partons , which we shall denote henceforth simply as @xmath0 . in the next section",
    "we introduce the qcd eikonal model and address the question of calculating the survival factor @xmath0 from processes of higgs boson production through @xmath26 fusion .",
    "the results are presented in the sec .",
    "iii , where we provide a systematic study of @xmath0 and its sensitivity to the infrared mass scale .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "it has been suggested that in hadron - hadron collisions the production of higgs bosons can occur by means of the fusion of gluons or electroweak bosons @xcite .",
    "the two main higgs production mechanisms are the gluon fusion @xmath27 and the @xmath26 fusion @xmath1 . in the gluon fusion process",
    "each hadron emits a gluon ( a colour octet ) , and the higgs boson is coupled to each one through a fermion loop . since the higgs boson couples to fermions according to their masses , its production cross section via gluon fusion is dominated by top quark loops . in gluon fusion",
    "the hadrons remnants must exchange colour with each other in order to become singlet states again .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath26 fusion process has a different colour flow structure : since the incoming hadrons ( as well as the @xmath26 bosons ) are colour singlets , when they emit a @xmath26 boson they remain as singlet states .",
    "thus no colour is exchanged between the scattered partons , and the two outgoing hadron remnant states are expected to be separated by a central rapidity gap .",
    "as indicated in the previous section , the survival probability of these rapidity gaps can be naturally defined in the impact parameter representation . in this formalism the inclusive differential higgs boson production cross section via @xmath26 fusion is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the overlap function at impact parameter space of the @xmath26 bosons .",
    "this function represents the effective density of the overlapping @xmath26 boson distributions in the colliding hadrons . the cross section for producing the higgs boson and having a large rapidity gap is given by @xmath30 where @xmath19 is the probability that the two initial hadrons have not undergone a inelastic scattering at the parton level . in qcd - inspired eikonal models",
    "this probability is given by @xmath20 , where the imaginary part @xmath21 of the eikonal function receives contributions of parton - parton interactions .",
    "therefore , the factor @xmath19 suppresses the contribution to the higgs boson cross section where the two initial hadrons overlap and there is soft rescatterings of the spectator partons . from the expressions ( [ definit01 ] ) , ( [ eqnarrat01 ] ) and",
    "( [ eqnarrat02 ] ) we can write down the survival factor @xmath0 for higgs production via @xmath26 fusion : @xmath31 where we have used the normalization condition @xmath32 . in this letter",
    "we shall compute the probability factor @xmath20 using a recently developed qcd eikonal model , where the onset of the dominance of gluons in the interaction of high - energy hadrons is managed by the dynamical gluon mass scale @xcite .",
    "the model , henceforth referred to as dgm model , satisfies analyticity and unitarity constraints .",
    "the latter is automatically satisfied in the eikonal representation , where the total cross section , the ratio @xmath33 of the real to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude , and the differential elastic scattering cross section are given by @xmath34 , \\label{degt1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath35   \\}}{\\textnormal{im } \\ { i \\int b\\ , db\\ , [ 1-e^{i\\chi ( b , s ) } ]   \\ } } , \\label{degthyj1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath36\\ , j_{0}(qb ) \\right|^2 , \\label{degthyj3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath14 is the square of the total cm energy , @xmath37 is the bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath38 is the ( complex ) eikonal function . in the dgm model",
    "the eikonal function is written as a combination of an even and odd eikonal terms related by crossing symmetry . in terms of the proton - proton ( @xmath23 ) and antiproton - proton ( @xmath24 ) scatterings , this combination reads @xmath39 .",
    "the even eikonal is written as the sum of gluon - gluon , quark - gluon , and quark - quark contributions : @xmath40 , \\label{final4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the overlap function at impact parameter space and @xmath42 are the elementary subprocess cross sections of colliding quarks and gluons ( @xmath43 ) . the overlap function , normalized so that @xmath44 , is associated with the fourier transform of a dipole form factor , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the modified bessel function of second kind .",
    "the odd eikonal @xmath47 , that accounts for the difference between @xmath23 and @xmath24 channels , is parametrized as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the dynamical gluon mass and the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants to be fitted .",
    "the factor @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 with the dynamical coupling constant @xmath54 set at its frozen infrared value .",
    "the origin of the dynamical gluon mass and the frozen coupling constant can be traced back to the early work of cornwall @xcite , and the formal expressions of these quantities can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the eikonal functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , needed to describe the lower - energy forward data , are simply parametrized with terms dictated by the regge phenomenology : @xmath57 @xmath58 \\ , w(b;\\sqrt{\\mu_{qq}\\mu_{gg } } ) , \\label{mdg2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are fitting parameters . the gluon - gluon eikonal contribution , that dominates at high energy and determines the asymptotic behaviour of the total cross sections , is written as @xmath64 , where @xmath65    here @xmath66 is the convoluted structure function for pair @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the subprocess cross section and @xmath69 is a fitting parameter . in the above expression",
    "it is introduced the energy threshold @xmath70 for the final state gluons , assuming that these are screened gluons @xcite . the structure function @xmath66 is given by @xmath71(\\tau)=\\int_{\\tau}^{1 } \\frac{dx}{x}\\ , g(x)\\ , g\\left ( \\frac{\\tau}{x}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the gluon distribution function , adopted as @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the correct analyticity properties of the model amplitudes is ensured by substituting @xmath76 throughout eqs .",
    "( [ mdg1 ] ) , ( [ mdg2 ] ) and ( [ sloh1 ] ) .    in the expression ( [ sloh1 ] ) the gluon - gluon subprocess cross section @xmath68 is calculated using a procedure dictated by the dynamical perturbation theory ( dpt ) @xcite : amplitudes that do not vanish to all orders of perturbation theory are given by their free - field values , whereas amplitudes that vanish in all orders in perturbation theory as @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the coupling constant ) are retained at lowest order . in our case",
    "this means that the effects of the dynamical gluon mass in the propagators and vertices are retained , and the sum of polarizations is performed for massless ( free - field ) gluons .",
    "as a result , since the dynamical masses go to zero at large momenta , the elementary cross sections of perturbative qcd in the high - energy limit are recovered .",
    "other details of the calculation can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .    according to the expression ( [ eqnarrat03 ] ) , the final step in order to calculate @xmath0 is to determine the overlap function @xmath29 of the electroweak bosons .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the survival factor @xmath0 depends on the nature of the colour - singlet exchange which generates the gap as well as on the distributions of partons inside the proton in impact parameter space @xcite .",
    "we simply assume that the distribution of @xmath26 bosons in impact parameter space in the hadron is the same as for the quarks . in this way , we can finally write down a phenomenologically useful expression to the survival factor @xmath0 : @xmath79    in the above expression the inverse size ( in impact parameter ) @xmath62 is the same as in the expression ( [ mdg1 ] ) .",
    "its value , as well as the value of the remaining fitting parameters , is determined from global fits to @xmath23 and @xmath24 forward scattering data , as discussed in the next section .",
    "in order to determine the exponential damping factor @xmath80 of eq .",
    "( [ eqnarrat09 ] ) and produce a consistent estimate of @xmath0 , we carry out global fits to the elastic differential scattering cross section for @xmath24 at @xmath81 tev and to all high - energy forward @xmath23 and @xmath24 scattering data above @xmath82 gev .",
    "this energy threshold is the same one used in the estimate of @xmath0 through the analysis of @xmath23 and @xmath24 scattering carried out by block and halzen using a previous qcd - inspired model @xcite .",
    "the forward data sets include the total cross section ( @xmath83 ) and the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we use the data sets compiled and analyzed by the particle data group @xcite , with the statistic and systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "the input values of the @xmath49 have been chosen to lie in the interval @xmath84 $ ] mev , as suggested by the value @xmath85 mev obtained in a previous analysis of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 channels via the dgm model @xcite .",
    "this input dynamical gluon mass range is also supported by recent studies on the @xmath86 photoproduction and the hadronic @xmath87 total cross sections @xcite , and on the behaviour of the gluon distribution function at small @xmath88 @xcite . in all the fits",
    "performed in this letter we use a @xmath89 fitting procedure , assuming an interval @xmath90 corresponding , in the case of normal errors , to the projection of the @xmath89 hypersurface containing 90% of probability . in the case of the dgm model ( 8 fitting parameters ) this corresponds to the interval @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92 values obtained in the global fits are relatively low , as show in table i. these results ( for 168 degrees of freedom ) indicate the excellence of the fits and show that the dgm model naturally accommodates all the data sets used in the fitting procedure . in table",
    "i we have included the values of the @xmath93 parameter , which determines the spatial distribution of the @xmath26 bosons at the impact parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we can observe a small dependence of their values on the dynamical gluon mass : the greater the input scale @xmath49 , the smaller the inverse size @xmath94 .",
    "the sensitivity of the survival probability @xmath0 ( for @xmath23 collisions ) to the gluon dynamical mass is shown in figure 1 for some cm energies .",
    "we note a slow increase of their values with the dynamical gluon mass and a fast decrease with the cm energies .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , where we have also plotted the exponential damping factor , this behaviour is related to the energy dependence of the imaginary part of the eikonal : @xmath21 grows with the energy and hence suppresses the integral ( [ eqnarrat09 ] ) . in table ii we list our results for the survival factor @xmath0 for some values of the proton - proton energy , and compare with other calculations in the literature , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 denote the results obtained by setting the mass infrared scale at @xmath4 and 600 mev , respectively .",
    "the last value is the same one adopted by block and halzen with respect to the _ ad hoc _ mass scale @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "we see that the dgm results are systematically larger than the block - halzen ones ( denoted by @xmath98 ) , but the large statistical errors resulting from our choice for the confidence region of the parameters ( cl=90 % ) indicate a reasonable compatibility between the @xmath95 and @xmath98 results at higher energies .",
    "the @xmath96 results at @xmath81 and 16 tev are in line with the @xmath99 ones , obtained by gotsman and collaborators using a regge pole model @xcite . in their approach",
    "they use an eikonalized version of the donnachie - landshoff model in order to satisfy unitarity @xcite .",
    "the authors argue that their relatively large values for @xmath0 can be reduced by an appropriate change in some parameters included in their gaussian approximation for @xmath18 and @xmath19 factors .",
    "we hasten to emphasise that the @xmath95 results have been obtained using the preferred statistical value of the dynamical gluon mass for @xmath23 and @xmath24 scattering , namely @xmath4 gev @xcite . in this case",
    "we believe that an eventual change in the parameters of the glm1 model may reduce their results in such a way to be compatible with the dgm1 ones .",
    "the @xmath100 results have been obtained by khoze and collaborators using a two - channel eikonal model which embodies pion - loop insertions in the pomeron trajectory , diffractive dissociation , and rescattering effects @xcite .",
    "the authors have calculated the survival probability @xmath0 in single , central and double diffractive processes at several energies , assuming that the spatial distribution in the parameter space is controlled by the slope @xmath17 of the pomeron - proton vertex .",
    "we show the @xmath100 results for double diffractive processes with @xmath101 gev@xmath102 , which corresponds to the slope of the electromagnetic proton form factor .",
    "these results are compatible with the dgm ones , in particular with the results taking into account @xmath4 mev , the optimum value for the dynamical gluon mass in @xmath23 and @xmath24 diffractive scattering @xcite .",
    "in this letter we have calculated the survival probability @xmath0 of large rapidity gaps by means of an eikonal qcd model with a dynamical gluon mass .",
    "since rapidity gaps can occur from production of higgs boson via fusion of electroweak bosons , we have focused on @xmath1 fusion processes .",
    "the eikonal function have been determined by fitting @xmath23 and @xmath24 accelerator scattering data .",
    "owing to the quality of the global fits , the dgm model allows us to describe successfully the @xmath24 differential cross section at @xmath81 tev , as well as the forward scattering quantities @xmath103 and @xmath104 , in excellent agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "these results show that the dgm model is well suited for the prediction of the survival probability of lrg at higher energies , in particular for @xmath0 one at the cern - lhc energy .    in table",
    "ii we list our results for @xmath0 and notice that their values decrease with the increase of the energy of the incoming protons .",
    "this behaviour , in line with results for lrg dijet production at the tevatron @xcite , is a direct consequence of the energy dependence of the imaginary part of the eikonal , that grows with the energy .",
    "a strong dependence of @xmath105 on the dynamical gluon mass @xmath49 emerges from our calculations , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this scale dependence arises as follows : the dynamical gluon mass affects strongly the behaviour of the gluon - gluon subprocess cross section @xmath68 , which dominates at high energy and determines the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 total cross section .",
    "hence the procedure consisting of global fits to diffractive @xmath23 and @xmath24 data in order to determine @xmath49 is well justified , and the value @xmath85 mev obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite via the dgm model is a suitable one .",
    "our estimates for the survival probability of large rapidity gaps using a qcd based eikonal model with a dynamical gluon mass are , within the errors , compatible with estimates obtained using other eikonal models .",
    "in particular , our estimates are close to the ones obtained by khoze _",
    "_ using a two - channel model , and to the ones obtained by block and halzen using a similar qcd - inspired approach . owing to the interval [ 300,750 ] mev inferred from the optimal value of @xmath49 discussed above ,",
    "there is room for smaller values of the survival factor in dgm model .",
    "for example , a mass scale @xmath106 mev gives a survival factor @xmath107 % at lhc , very close to the central value obtained via the kmr model .",
    "however , we call attention to the fact that all these estimates are model dependent , despite their apparent agreement . for example , the @xmath100 results for other values of @xmath108 and for central and single diffractive processes do not agree with ours @xcite . the same is expected in the @xmath98 results for other choices of the mass scale @xmath97 .    in summary , there is a strong dependence in the size of the survival probabilities and in their energy dependence on specific models for the rise of total hadronic cross section .",
    "more specifically , the survival factor @xmath0 depends on the dynamics of the whole diffractive part of the scattering matrix as well as the nature of the colour - singlet exchange which generates the gap . from the experimental viewpoint",
    ", it is known that the survival factor @xmath0 in the case of higgs production via @xmath1 fusion processes can be monitored by observing the closely related central production of a @xmath109 boson with the same jet and rapidity gap configuration @xcite .",
    "more recently , this idea has been developed further by considering the decays of both higgs and @xmath109 bosons into @xmath110 pairs @xcite .",
    "this allows to gauge higgs weak boson fusion production at the lhc and permits to observe a light higgs boson via its dominant @xmath111 decay mode in addiction to the usually discussed @xmath112 and @xmath113 channels .",
    "this option would permit to reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the rate of higgs central production events with rapidity gaps .",
    "the success of the qcd - based eikonal model with a dynamical gluon mass in reproducing diffractive scattering data , over a large energy range , shows that such a model provides a reliable estimate of the survival probability @xmath0 as a function of energy in the case of @xmath23 and @xmath24 channels .",
    "the study of the survival factor @xmath0 is interesting in its own right since they enables us to increase our understanding of some features of hadronic interactions , and may provide an useful tool to probe physics beyond the standard model .",
