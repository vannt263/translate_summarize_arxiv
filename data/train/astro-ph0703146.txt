    "there is strong evidence for relativistic motions in jets that emanate from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "in particular , apparent superluminal speeds @xmath9 ( in units of the speed of light  @xmath10 ) as high as @xmath11 have been measured for radio components on ( projected ) scales of @xmath12pc in the blazar class of sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used a method based on a comparison between the time scale of flux density decline and the light - travel time across the imaged emission region to relate @xmath9 to the bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 of the outflow ; they inferred that the lorentz factors of blazar jets lie in the range @xmath14 , with the majority of quasar components having @xmath15 and with bl lac objects possessing a more uniform @xmath13 distribution .",
    "@xcite recently reached a similar conclusion on the basis of probability arguments , inferring that roughly half the sources in a flux density - limited , beamed sample have a value of @xmath13 close to the measured @xmath9 .",
    "they further deduced that the maximum lorentz factor in their sample of 119 agn jets is @xmath16 , close to the value of @xmath11 inferred for the jets observed by @xcite .",
    "the presence of relativistic bulk motions in blazar jets has been independently indicated by measurements of rapid variations in the total and polarized fluxes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is also evidence that the relativistic speeds persist to large scales .",
    "for example , apparent superluminal component motions have been measured in the 3c 120 jet out to projected distances from the source of at least @xmath17pc @xcite , and it has been argued that the spectral properties of the heads of extended ( up to several hundred kiloparsecs ) jets can be explained in the context of a relativistic flow that is decelerated to subrelativistic speeds at the termination shock that advances into the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "the main source of power of agn jets is the rotational energy of the central supermassive black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or its accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the naturally occurring low mass density and hence high magnetization of black - hole magnetospheres suggests that the relativistic jets originate directly from the black - hole ergosphere , whereas the disk surface launches a slower , possibly nonrelativistic wind that surrounds and confines the highly relativistic flow .",
    "this picture finds support in recent numerical simulations ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this issue is far from settled and one can not rule out the inner part of accretion disk as a base of a relativistic outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the theory of relativistic , magnetically driven jets from black holes ( and neutron stars ) predicts highly magnetized flows , with the poynting flux dominating the total energy output . at the jet emission site this energy has to be transferred to particles",
    "this transfer may have the form of magnetic dissipation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but the still commonly held view is that the poynting energy is first converted into bulk kinetic energy and only subsequently channeled into radiation through shocks and other dissipative waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the jet radiative efficiency is still one of the key debatable issues in the theory of poynting - dominated outflows . in principle ,",
    "slow magnetic dissipation in an expanding jet may also facilitate the gradual conversion of poynting flux into bulk kinetic energy @xcite .    when the inertia of the plasma is negligibly small its dynamics is well described by the approximation of force - free electrodynamics ( or magnetodynamics ;",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the equations of magnetodynamics are much simpler than those of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , which is what prompted their application to the study of the magnetic acceleration of relativistic jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the solutions of these equations describe trans - alfvnic flows whose drift velocity approaches the speed of light at infinity , the location of the fast critical point in these models .",
    "however , within this framework it is impossible to account for the conversion of poynting flux into plasma kinetic energy and to study the issue of the acceleration efficiency efficiency .    the next simplest approximation that can be used to address",
    "the issue of poynting - to - kinetic energy conversion is ideal mhd . in this case one can obtain exact semi - analytic solutions ,",
    "although , because of the complexity of the problem , this can only be done when the system possesses a high degree of symmetry .",
    "this approach was pioneered by @xcite , who constructed nonrelativistic semi - analytic solutions for steady - state , cold , self - similar ( in the spherical radial coordinate ) disk outflows .",
    "these solutions were generalized to the ( special ) relativistic mhd regime by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "they were further investigated by @xcite , who also considered the effect of thermal forces during the early phases of the acceleration .",
    "solutions with similar properties were derived in @xcite by linearizing about a force - free solution for a paraboloidal field geometry .",
    "a key property of the relativistic solutions derived in the aforementioned studies is the extended nature of the acceleration region : the bulk of the ( poloidal ) acceleration is effected by magnetic pressure gradients ( associated with the azimuthal magnetic field component ) and takes place beyond the classical fast - magnetosonic point ( a singular point of the bernoulli equation ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted this behaviour ( which was dubbed the `` magnetic nozzle '' effect by @xcite ; see also @xcite ) in terms of the distinction between the classical and the modified fast - magnetosonic surfaces ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they pointed out that the latter surface , which is the locus of the fast - magnetosonic singular points of the combined bernoulli and trans - field ( or grad - shafranov ) equations , is the true causality surface ( or `` event horizon '' ) for the propagation of fast waves when the shape of the field lines is obtained from the solution of the trans - field equation ( with the classical surface playing this role only when the shape of the flux surfaces is predetermined ) .",
    "they argued that , in this case , the acceleration continues all the way to ( and possibly even past ) the modified fast - magnetosonic surface , which can lie well beyond the classical one .",
    "another general property of the cold mhd solutions is that , in the current - carrying regime ( where the poloidal components of the current density and the magnetic field are antiparallel ) they collimate ( asymptotically ) to cylinders .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic lorentz factor corresponds to a rough equipartition between the poynting and kinetic energy fluxes .",
    "the continuation of the acceleration process beyond the classical fast - magnetosonic surface is evidently a general characteristic of steady - state mhd solutions that applies also to nonrelativistic jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this behaviour should , however , be more clearly discerned in observations of relativistic flows , where the proper speed @xmath18 can increase by a large factor between the classical and the modified singular surfaces .",
    "in contrast , the magnetic acceleration of non - relativistic flows is almost complete at the classical fast point .",
    "this striking difference has a very simple origin . for nonrelativistic flows",
    "the criticality condition at the classical fast - magnetosonic point implies equipartition between the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy of poloidal motion .",
    "the kinetic energy can therefore increase by at most a factor of 2 beyond this point .",
    "however , relativistic flows remain magnetically dominated at the fast - magnetosonic point , which means that there is an ample remaining supply of magnetic energy that can be used for flow acceleration downstream of this point ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the case of agns",
    "there have indeed been indications from a growing body of data that the associated relativistic jets undergo the bulk of their acceleration on scales that are of the order of those probed by very - long - baseline radio interferometry . in one line of reasoning , the absence of bulk - comptonization spectral signatures in blazars has been used to infer that jet lorentz factors @xmath19 are only attained on scales @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "there have also been explicit inferences of component acceleration based on radio proper motion and x - ray emission measurements for the jets in the quasars 3c 345 @xcite and 3c 279 @xcite .",
    "extended acceleration in the 3c 345 jet has been independently indicated by the higher apparent speeds of jet components located further away from the nucleus @xcite and by the observed luminosity variations of the moving components @xcite .",
    "similar effects in other blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that parsec - scale acceleration to relativistic speeds may be a common feature of agn jets .",
    "@xcite argued that these observations are most naturally interpreted in terms of magnetic driving and employed self - similar relativistic jet solutions to generate model fits to the 3c 345 data in support of this conclusion .    while the semi - analytic solutions have been useful in indicating basic properties of the magnetic acceleration process and in providing valuable clues to the interpretation of the observational data , more general solutions are needed to confirm these results and to gain a fuller understanding of the generation of relativistic jets in agns .",
    "in particular , numerical simulations are needed to find out whether the self - similar model captures the essential properties of outflows that obey realistic boundary conditions and that are not required to be in a steady state . among the questions that such simulations could answer",
    "are : ( 1 ) do disk outflows in fact approach a steady state , and , if they do , is that state stable ? ( 2 ) is the acceleration indeed generally extended , and to what extent does the asymptotic state of the self - similar solutions approximate the far - field behaviour of more realistic outflows ? ( 3 ) do any new traits emerge when the restrictions imposed by the self - similarity assumption are removed ?",
    "of particular interest is the question of the ability of the magnetic driving mechanism to accelerate outflows to high lorentz factors with high efficiency over astrophysically relevant distance scales .",
    "another important question is whether highly relativistic flows can be strongly collimated by purely magnetic stresses .",
    "there have been lingering doubts over these issues in the literature ( see section  [ theory ] ) , and although they have already received tentative answers , a full numerical study could help to settle them once and for all .",
    "although there have already been several reported simulations of the formation of jets in black - hole accretion flows using relativistic ( in fact , _",
    "general_-relativistic ) mhd codes , so far they have provided only partial answers to the above questions .",
    "the existing calculations indicate that magnetic acceleration indeed operates over several decades in radius and can accelerate jets to relativistic speeds . however , the extended nature of the acceleration typically results in the bulk lorentz factor reaching only a small fraction of its potential asymptotic value by the time the simulation is terminated .",
    "for example , in the longest jet simulated to date , which extended to @xmath21 times the gravitational radius @xmath22 of the central black hole @xcite , the lorentz factor on the largest computed scale was @xmath23 , which is just @xmath24 of the estimated asymptotic value .",
    "this impressive simulation deals with an extremely complex system of which the jet is only one component , the other being the black hole , the accretion disk , the disk corona , the low - speed `` wall jet , '' and their surroundings .",
    "ultimately , this is the kind of simulation one wants to carry out in order to fully understand the dynamics of agn outflows .",
    "however , they are also very challenging from the computational point of view .",
    "one major concern ins that , in view of the extended nature of its acceleration , the jet is particularly vulnerable to numerical diffusion and dissipation .",
    "these numerical effects may partly explain why the quantity @xmath25 in the above - cited paper , which is the same as our @xmath26 ( equation  [ kap - def ] ) and should be a field - line constant , in fact decreases by about one order of magnitude along a mid - level field line in the simulated jet ( see fig .",
    "7 in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we address the above questions through numerical simulations specifically designed for investigating the key aspects of ideal - mhd acceleration of relativistic jets . in the first place",
    ", we use a numerical scheme based on a linear riemann solver @xcite that does not need a large artificial diffusion for numerical stability .",
    "this distinguishes it from most other schemes for relativistic mhd , including those that are based on hll , kt and similar flux prescriptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simple one - dimensional tests suggest that this should lead to a noticeably greater accuracy in two - dimensional problems that involve stationary flows that are aligned with the computational grid @xcite .",
    "secondly , instead of studying jet propagation through some ambient medium , we consider the case of a flow in a funnel with solid walls .",
    "this allows us to avoid the errors that would otherwise be caused by numerical mass diffusion and dissipation at the interface .",
    "finally , we employ elliptical ( or spherical ) coordinates adapted to the chosen paraboloidal ( or conical ) shape of the funnel .",
    "this allows us to have the jet well resolved everywhere ( using a fixed number of grid points across the funnel ) and to benefit from the close alignment of the flow with the computational grid .",
    "these careful measures in conjunction with a grid - extension method enable us , for the first time , to track the acceleration and collimation processes to their completion .",
    "we describe the basic equations in section  [ equations ] and the numerical calculations in section  [ simulations ] .",
    "the simulation results are presented in section  [ results ] and discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we summarize in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "since most of the acceleration takes place far away from the source , we assume that the space - time is flat .",
    "moreover , the flow is described in an inertial frame at rest relative to the source . in this case",
    "we can write the system of ideal relativistic mhd as follows . the _ continuity equation _",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rest mass density of matter , @xmath29 is its 4-velocity , and @xmath30 is the determinant of the metric tensor ; the _ energy - momentum equations _",

    "@xmath39    the total stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath32 , is a sum of the stress - energy momentum tensor of matter @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the thermodynamic pressure and @xmath42 is the enthalpy per unit volume , and the stress - energy momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field @xmath43\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the maxwell tensor of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the electric and magnetic field are defined as measured by an observer stationary relative to the spatial grid , which gives @xmath45 and @xmath46    in the limit of ideal mhd @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the usual 3-velocity of the plasma .",
    "we use an isentropic equation of state @xmath49 where @xmath50const and @xmath51 .",
    "since we are interested in the magnetic acceleration of cold flows , we make @xmath52 very small , so the gas pressure is never a dynamical factor .",
    "this relation enables us to exclude the energy equation from the integrated system . however , the momentum equation remains intact , including the nonlinear advection term .",
    "therefore , if the conditions for shock formation were to arise , our calculation would capture that shock .      the poloidal magnetic field is fully described by the azimuthal component of the vector potential , @xmath53    for axisymmetric solutions @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , the so - called magnetic flux function , is the total magnetic flux enclosed by the circle @xmath56const ( @xmath57 being the coordinates of the meridional plane ) .",
    "stationary and axisymmetric ideal mhd flows have 5 quantities that propagate unchanged along the magnetic field lines and thus are functions of @xmath58 alone . these are @xmath59 , the rest - mass energy flux per unit magnetic flux ; @xmath60 , the angular velocity of magnetic field lines ; @xmath61 , the the total angular momentum flux per unit rest - mass energy flux ; @xmath26 , the total energy flux per unit rest - mass energy flux ; and @xmath52 , the entropy per particle . for cold flows ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 )",
    "we have @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the magnitude of the poloidal component of the 4-velocity , @xmath69 is the magnitude of the poloidal component of the magnetic field , @xmath70 is the cylindrical radius , @xmath71 is the total electric current flowing through a loop of radius @xmath70 , @xmath72 is the ratio of the poynting flux to the matter ( kinetic plus rest - mass ) energy flux , and @xmath73 is the poynting flux per unit rest - mass energy flux .",
    "( here and in the rest of the paper we use a hat symbol over vector indices to indicate their components in a normalized coordinate basis . ) from equation  ( [ kap - def ] ) it follows that the lorentz factor @xmath13 can not exceed @xmath26 .",
    "to maintain a firm control over the jet s confinement and to prevent complications related to numerical diffusion of the dense nonrelativistic plasma from the jet s surroundings , we study outflows that propagate inside a solid funnel of a prescribed shape .. ] specifically , we consider axisymmetric paraboloidal funnels @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath70 are the cylindrical coordinates of the funnel wall .",
    "this suggests the utilization of a system of coordinates in which the funnel wall is a coordinate surface . for a conical jet ( @xmath76 )",
    "we use spherical coordinates , whereas for jets with @xmath77 we employ elliptical coordinates @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( see appendix  [ appendix_1 ] for details ) .",

    "we use a godunov - type numerical code based on the scheme described in @xcite . to reduce numerical diffusion we applied parabolic reconstruction instead of the linear one of the original code .",
    "our procedure , in brief , was to calculate minmod - averaged first and second derivatives and use the first three terms of the taylor expansion for spatial reconstruction .",
    "this simple procedure has resulted in a noticeable improvement in the solution accuracy even though the new scheme is still not 3rd - order accurate because of the non - uniformity of the grid .",
    "the grid is uniform in the @xmath91 direction ( the polar angle direction when we use spherical coordinates ) , where in most runs it has a total of 60 cells . to check the convergence ,",
    "some runs were repeated with a doubled resolution .",
    "the cells are elongated in the @xmath86 direction ( the radial direction when we use spherical coordinates ) , reflecting the elongation of the funnel .",
    "for very elongated cells we observed numerical instability , so we imposed an upper limit of 40 on the length / width ratio .    to speed up the simulations",
    ", we implemented a sectioning of the computational grid as described in @xcite . in each section , which is shaped as a ring ,",
    "the numerical solution is advanced using a time step based on the local courant condition .",
    "it is twice as large as the time step of the adjacent inner ring and twice as small as the time step of the adjacent outer ring .",
    "this approach is particularly effective for conical flows but less so for highly collimated , almost cylindrical configurations .",
    "we treat the inlet boundary , @xmath92 , as a surface of a perfectly conducting rotator and consider two rotation laws , @xmath93 and @xmath94\\ , , \\label{omega}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 marks the jet boundary .",
    "the angular velocity profile is directly related to the distribution of the return electric current in the jet ( see equation  [ i - bp ] below ) .",
    "in fact , the current is driven by the electric field associated with the rotating poloidal field , and charge conservation requires the circuit to eventually close . in the case of constant @xmath60 the return current flows over the jet boundary .",
    "for the rotation law ( [ omega ] ) it is distributed over the jet body as a volume current , the current changing sign at @xmath96 .",
    "thus , we cover the two generic types of electric current distribution .",
    "the solid - body rotation law provides a very good description of the behaviour of magnetic field lines that thread the horizon of a black hole .",
    "this choice is therefore entirely appropriate for the black - hole theory of relativistic agn jets .",
    "the differential rotation law is more suitable to the accretion - disk theory , although it admittedly does not correspond to a realistic velocity field ( which is hard to model given the limitations of our numerical technique ) .",
    "the condition of perfect conductivity allows us to fix the azimuthal component of the electric field and the @xmath86 component of the magnetic field : @xmath97 from the first of these conditions we derive @xmath98 and ( using equation [ omega - def ] ) @xmath99 we have also experimented with non - uniform distributions of the magnetic field , in particular with @xmath87 decreasing with @xmath91 .",
    "the results were not significantly different as the field distribution downstream of the inlet underwent a rapid rearrangement that restored the transverse force balance .    on the assumption of a cold ( i.e. zero thermal energy ) jet ,",
    "the flow at the inlet boundary is necessarily super  slow - magnetosonic .",
    "this means that both the density and the radial component of the velocity can be prescribed some fixed values : @xmath100 in the simulations we used @xmath101 , which was a choice of convenience . on the one hand , this value is sufficiently small to insure that the flow at @xmath102 is sub - alfvnic and hence that the alfvn and fast - magnetosonic critical surfaces are located downstream of the inlet boundary . on the other hand , it is large enough to promote a rapid settlement to a steady state ( keeping in mind that the speed of a steady - state flow remains constant along the symmetry axis ) .",
    "because of the sub - alfvenic nature of the inlet flow , we can not fix the other components of the magnetic field and the velocity  they are to be found as part of the global solution .",
    "following the standard approach we extrapolate @xmath103 and @xmath104 from the domain into the inlet boundary cells .",
    "we then compute @xmath105 and @xmath106 from equations  ( [ v_xi_b ] ) and  ( [ v_phi_b ] ) .",
    "in the case of differential rotation the magnitude of the angular velocity is chosen in such a way that the alfvn surface of the jet is near the jet origin , its closest point being located at a distance of @xmath107 times the initial jet radius from the inlet surface . in the case of solid - body rotation",
    "the alfvn surface almost coincides with the light cylinder , whose radius @xmath108 is only @xmath109 larger than the initial jet radius .",
    "the inlet density is chosen so that all jets have very similar values of @xmath26 and @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , for the models with uniform @xmath60 we have @xmath110 , and for the models with non - uniform @xmath60 we have @xmath111 .      the computational domain is always chosen to be long enough for the jet to be super  fast - magnetosonic when it approaches the outlet boundary @xmath112 .",
    "this justifies the use of radiative boundary conditions at this boundary ( i.e. we determine the state variables of the boundary cells via extrapolation of the domain solution ) .    at the polar axis , @xmath113 , we impose symmetry boundary conditions for the dependent variables that are expected to pass through zero there , @xmath114 these variables include @xmath104 , @xmath103 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . for other variables",
    "we impose a `` zero second derivative '' condition , @xmath117 which means that we use linear interpolation to calculate the values of these variables in the boundary cells .",
    "we do this in order to improve the numerical representation of a narrow core that develops in all cases as a result of the magnetic hoop stress . within this core",
    "the gradients in the @xmath91 direction are very large and the usual zero - gradient condition , @xmath118 , results in increased numerical diffusion in this region .",
    "we have checked that this has a noticeable effect only on the axial region and that the global solution does not depend on which of these two conditions is used .    at the wall boundary , @xmath119 , we use a reflection condition , @xmath120 for @xmath104 and @xmath115 and a zero - gradient condition for all other variables .",
    "the initial configuration corresponds to a non - rotating , purely poloidal magnetic field with approximately constant magnetic pressure across the funnel .",
    "the plasma density within the funnel is set to a small value so that the outflow generated at the inlet boundary can easily sweep it away . in order to speed this process up the @xmath86 component of velocity inside the funnel",
    "is set equal to @xmath121 , whereas the @xmath91 component is set equal to zero .",
    "the inner rings of the grid , where the grid cells are small and so is the time step , are the computationally most intensive regions of the simulation domain .",
    "if we kept computing these inner rings during the whole run then we would not be able to advance very far from the jet origin .",
    "fortunately , the trans - sonic nature of the jet flow allows us to cease computations in the inner region once the solution there settles to a steady state . to be more precise",
    ", we cut the funnel along the @xmath91-coordinate surfaces into overlapping sectors with the intention of computing only within one sector at any given time , starting with the sector closest to the inlet boundary .",
    "once the solution in the `` active '' sector settles to a steady state we switch to the subsequent sector , located further away from the inlet . during the switch the solution in the outermost cells of the active sector is copied into the corresponding inner boundary cells of the subsequent sector . during the computation within the latter sector",
    "these inner boundary cells are not updated .",
    "surely , this procedure is justified only when the flow in a given sector can not communicate with the flow in the preceding sector through hyperbolic waves , and thus we need to ensure that the mach cone of the fast - magnetosonic waves points outward at the sector interfaces .",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath122 where @xmath123 ( see equation  [ eos ] ) and @xmath124 is the magnetic field magnitude in the fluid frame ( see appendix  [ appendix_2 ] for details ) . in the cold limit",
    "this reduces to @xmath125^{1/2 } c_f \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is the isotropic fast speed in the fluid frame .",
    "thus , the jet has to be super - fast in the @xmath86 direction at the sector interfaces . in figs .",

    "one can see that the transition to the super - fast regime occurs well inside the first sector .",
    "( note that when @xmath128 the inequality [ criterion_cold ] is satisfied . )    in these simulations we normally used 4 or 5 sectors , with each additional sector being ten times longer than the preceding one .",
    "this technique has enabled us to reduce the computational time by up to three orders of magnitude , depending on the funnel geometry .",
    "although the grid extension can in principle be continued indefinitely , there are other factors that limit how far along the jet one can advance in practice .",
    "firstly , once the paraboloidal jets become highly collimated the required number of grid cells along the jet axis increases , and each successive sector becomes more expensive than the previous one .",
    "secondly , computational errors due to numerical diffusion gradually accumulate in the downstream region of the flow and the solution becomes progressively less accurate ( see fig .",
    "[ constants ] ) .",
    "models a , b , c and d have geometrical power indices @xmath129 and @xmath130 , respectively . further classification is based on the rotation law : models a1d1 have non - uniform rotation , whereas models a2d2 have uniform rotation .",
    "models with different power indices but the same rotation law show remarkably similar properties .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to show only one of them in greater detail . for this purpose we selected models c1 , c2 and a2 .",
    "[ c1 - 2d ] shows the distribution of the lorentz factor , the lab - frame rest - mass density , the poloidal magnetic field , and the poloidal electric current for model c1 .",
    "the top panel presents the solution in the innermost grid sector whereas the bottom panels show the solution in the second and third sectors `` glued '' together .",
    "the density distribution as well as the magnetic field lines clearly indicate that the jet develops a core where the magnetic surfaces become almost cylindrical .",
    "the core is produced by the hoop stress of the toroidal magnetic field that is wound up in the main body of the jet due by the rotation at its base .",
    "the ratio of the core radius to the jet radius decreases monotonically with increasing distance from the source until the core eventually becomes unresolved on the grid .",
    "the solution then develops what looks like an axial line current .",
    "( such behaviour is also observed in models a2d2 ; see fig .",
    "[ ahu - b ] ) .    near the jet boundary",
    ", where the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines in model c1 vanishes , the azimuthal magnetic field component is weak and the equilibrium is supported in part by the poloidal field .",
    "if the flow were self - similar , one would have @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and the pressure of the azimuthal field in the main body of the jet would eventually become much larger than the pressure of the poloidal field in the boundary sheath , leading to a loss of force balance .",
    "in reality , the flow adjusts through a progressive compression of the sheath .",
    "consequently a thin layer of surface current gradually develops as the distance from the source increases .",
    "this is why some current lines in the bottom - right panel of fig .  [ c1 - 2d ] appear to terminate at the jet surface .",

    "the reason why the model d curve is significantly shorter than the other is that the strong collimation of the jet rapidly renders the computation prohibitively expensive in this case .",
    "since more rapidly collimated jets reach the same cylindrical radius at a larger distance from the source , the similar growth rates of the lorentz factor with cylindrical radius imply a faster growth with spherical radius for less collimated jets .",

    "the behaviour of our unconfined jet model is consistent with the results of @xcite , who showed ( for both the nonrelativistic and modestly relativistic regimes ) that a collimated axial jet can form from an initially spherical mhd wind .",
    "those results were , however , derived on the assumption that the magnetic field is purely azimuthal and the velocity field purely poloidal from the start .",
    "the good collimation exhibited by all our jet models in the vicinity of the axis can be attributed to the action of magnetic hoop stresses associated with a poloidal current flow , as discussed in   [ theory ] .",
    "over the years there have been persistent doubts in the literature regarding the ability of magnetic forces to accelerate flows to relativistic speeds . in particular ,",
    "several published studies have concluded that mhd acceleration of relativistic flows is inherently inefficient .",
    "this conclusion , however , is erroneous and can be attributed to the adoption of a conical ( split - monopole ) flow geometry in these studies . for example , in the work of @xcite a simplified conical geometry was used in which the full system of relativistic mhd equations was not satisfied , whereas the results of @xcite were based on a perturbative analysis around a quasi - conical flow .",

    "the component of the lorentz force along the poloidal magnetic field lines , @xmath133 , simply vanishes .",
    "more general treatments of the problem , based on exact semi - analytic solutions for axisymmetric , highly magnetized , steady outflows under the assumption of radial self - similarity @xcite , have demonstrated that magnetic acceleration in non - conical geometries can be quite efficient , typically resulting in a rough asymptotic equipartition between the poynting and matter energy fluxes .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached on the basis of a perturbative analysis around a _",

    "these results have indicated that the correct paradigm should , in fact , be that magnetic acceleration is generally a rather efficient mechanism for producing relativistic flows .    in this paper",

    "we have focused on the parameter regime that is most relevant to agn jets . in a future paper ( komissarov et al .",

    "one of the interesting outcomes of this study is the highly effective acceleration even in the case where the shape of the outer boundary is conical .",
    "although the acceleration efficiency in conical steady flows is  as explained above ",

    "the direct relationship between the function @xmath163 and the acceleration efficiency can be readily shown by combining equations  ( [ sigma - def ] ) and  ( [ i - bp ] ) to obtain @xmath164    since @xmath163 depends on the shape of the flow , the latter relation brings out the importance of the trans - field force balance and the connection between acceleration and collimation .",
    "if the poloidal magnetic field is almost uniformly distributed across the jet then @xmath165 ; this is the case near the inlet boundary .",
    "however , due to the collimation , the poloidal magnetic flux becomes concentrated near the rotation axis , forming a cylindrical core and causing @xmath163 to decrease with increasing @xmath70 ( see fig .  [ neck1 ] ) .",
    "our jet solutions are characterized by a high magnetic - to - kinetic energy conversion efficiency , but in the final states that we obtain the kinetic and poynting energy fluxes are still of comparable magnitude , as previously found in the self - similar solutions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note in this connection that @xcite conjectured on the basis of their asymptotic analysis that relativistic mhd outflows with a finite total magnetic flux will tend to convert their entire magnetic energy into kinetic energy at large distances from the origin .",
    "although our solutions are terminated at a finite distance and thus we can not exclude the possibility that eventually nearly all the magnetic energy will be extracted , it appears that this is unlikely to occur on astrophysically realistic scales .",
    "furthermore , our discussion above suggests that the reason given by @xcite for the limited conversion efficiency of self - similar flows , namely , that it may be hard to meaningfully decrease the quantity @xmath166 in a medium that contains an infinite magnetic flux @xmath58 , is not correct , since the relevant quantity is @xmath167 ( equation  [ s ] ) , which remains finite even in the self - similar case .",
    "our results show efficient self - collimation , contrary to some claims in the literature and certain seemingly similar investigations that reached the opposite conclusion . as the term `` self collimation '' is sometimes misunderstood and confused with `` self confinement '' , we start by clarifying its meaning . in general , a hydromagnetic jet can not be `` self confined '' for the simple reason that the `` outward '' effect of magnetic pressure always overcomes the `` inward '' effect of magnetic tension in mhd equilibria ( see e.g. section 5.3 in * ? ? ?",
    "there must always be an external medium that confines the system at its boundaries .",

    "self - collimation in the super - alfvnic regime of magnetized outflows is the result of the @xmath133 force in the trans - field direction . in relativistic flows ,",
    "the effect of this force is almost completely countered by the electric force , resulting in slower collimation compared to the nonrelativistic case ( where the electric force is negligible ) .",

    "in fact , it remains possible in flows with even higher asymptotic lorentz factors @xcite .",
    "although for @xmath171 the collimation is indeed slow , it is more efficient near the source , where the flow is not yet highly relativistic .",

    "as explained above , a high lorentz factor leads to a large @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "another difference between the two works is that we are able to follow the flow to larger distances and hence to a smaller-@xmath72 regime : in fact , in some cases ( a2 and b2 ) our solutions extend all the way to the asymptotic regime , where the acceleration ceases and the lorentz factor saturates to a constant value .",

    "agn jets could be confined by a variety of forces , including , for example , the thermal pressure of an ambient gas distribution , the ram pressure of a wind from the outer regions of the nuclear disk , and the stress of a magnetic field anchored in the disk ( and possibly embedded in a disk outflow ) .",
    "[ p_ext ] shows the effective pressure deduced in this way ( @xmath225 ) as a function of spherical radius for models a2d2 .",
    "although none of the curves is an exact power law of the form @xmath226 , it is nevertheless informative to calculate mean power - law indices .",
    "we find @xmath227 , 2 , 1.6 and 1.1 for models a2 , b2 , c2 and d2 , respectively .",
    "the models are thus seen to cover a wide range of behaviours . as expected , the more highly collimated funnel geometries correspond to the less steeply declining effective pressure distributions .",
    "the largest indices might correspond to confinement by a wind .",
    "for example , in a spherical wind of polytropic index 5/3 , the thermal pressure scales as @xmath228 and the ram pressure as @xmath229 .",
    "thus , a disk wind that assumes a nearly spherical geometry as it propagates away from the disk surface could effectively confine a relativistic jet with a nearly conical outer boundary .",
    "we note in this connection that @xcite suggested that collimated jets necessarily correspond to confining pressure distributions with @xmath230 .",
    "our results indicate that higher values of the effective power - law index are also possible .",
    "although we have focused in this paper on agn jets , it is interesting to note that relativistic outflows with terminal lorentz factors as high as @xmath23 have also been inferred in galactic x - ray binary sources , which comprise both black holes and neutron stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that arguments have been advanced in support of the possibility that the mean lorentz factors in these sources are comparable to those estimated in agns @xcite .",
    "the magnetic acceleration mechanism discussed in this paper is also a likely candidate for the driving of x - ray binary jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , even if these jets are similar to those in agns , as of now the latter remain the best targets for observations that could test and constrain the model .",
    "this paper presents the results of special - relativistic , ideal - mhd numerical simulations of agn jets .",
    "the numerical code employed in these simulations was specifically designed for this task .",
    "in contrast to most previous numerical schemes that modeled relativistic mhd jets , our code does not require a large artificial viscosity for numerical stability and is well suited for studies of two - dimensional stationary flows that are aligned with the computational grid . to avoid numerical dissipation induced at the interface with an ambient medium ,",
    "we have simplified the calculation by taking the flow to be confined by a solid wall .",
    "we took the shape of the wall to be either a paraboloid of revolution or a cone and used corresponding elliptical or spherical coordinates to optimize the resolution as well as the alignment of the flow with the computational grid .",
    "in addition , we implemented a grid - extension method that allowed us to follow the flow out to scales @xmath231 times that of the inlet boundary , which was crucial to our ability to study the inherently extended nature of mhd acceleration to high lorentz factors . to ensure the self - consistency of this procedure",
    ", we derived the condition for the mach cone of the fast - magnetosonic waves to point outward at the boundary between a given grid sector and the successive one , and we verified that this condition is satisfied at each of the relevant sector interfaces .",
    "our carefully designed numerical scheme has enabled us to simulate , for the first time , the magnetic acceleration and collimation of relativistic jets to completion . in particular , we have found that initially poynting flux - dominated jets can be effectively accelerated to high bulk lorentz factors with an efficiency ( defined as the ratio of the final kinetic energy flux to the total energy flux ) @xmath232 . as expected from previous semi - analytic ( radially self - similar ) solutions for steady - state flows , the acceleration process is spatially extended .",
    "we have found that our simulated jets invariably settle to a steady state , which suggests ( although we did not explore this issue explicitly ) that the resulting flow configurations are not inherently unstable ( at least not to axisymmetric perturbations  although it is conceivable that the imposed rigid wall has a stabilizing influence in this regard  and excluding by design any effects of a direct interaction with an ambient medium ) .",
    "the properties of the derived final configurations were found to be qualitatively very similar to those of the self - similar agn jet solutions of @xcite and to not depend sensitively on either the imposed shape of the outer boundary or on the distribution of the injected poloidal current at the inlet boundary .",
    "( we explored boundaries with scalings , in cylindrical coordinates , ranging from @xmath233 to @xmath234 , and current distributions that either closed within the volume of the jet or on its outer boundary . )",
    "we provided a physical explanation of the basic acceleration process and of the variations in the detailed behaviour among the different flow configurations that we simulated .",
    "we argued that the robustness of the acceleration process can be attributed to the fact that the bulk of the outflow initially follows paraboloidal trajectories , including the case of a conical outer boundary .",
    "we highlighted the connection between the collimation of the flow , which is manifested in the curved streamlines , and the acceleration process .",
    "the collimation in the current - carrying regime is essentially due to magnetic hoop stress associated with the azimuthal magnetic - field component @xmath235 .",
    "the collimation induces a reduction in the magnitude of @xmath236 ( where @xmath69 is the poloidal field component ) along the poloidal streamlines , which corresponds to a decrease in the poynting flux along the flow and therefore results in acceleration ( driven by the gradient of the magnetic pressure associated with @xmath235 ) .",
    "previous claims in the literature that magnetic acceleration of relativistic flows is inefficient were all based on the assumption that the streamlines have a split - monopole geometry ( or very nearly so ) , which is a singular case in which by fiat @xmath237 remains constant ( or close to a constant ) along the flow .",
    "our solutions also revealed that the collimation efficiency of relativistic jets can be high if they are accelerated from an initial lorentz factor @xmath5 .",
    "we argued that published results in the literature that claimed otherwise in fact had a significantly higher @xmath238 .",
    "once the flow attains a high lorentz factor the collimation process slows down on account of the increased inertia and of the growth of the electric force , which almost completely balances the transverse magnetic force .",
    "nevertheless , the current - carrying central region of our simulated jets collimates much faster than the imposed boundaries and attains a cylindrical shape by the time the terminal lorentz factor is attained , again in full agreement with the semi - analytic self - similar solutions ( which also assumed @xmath5 ) . in simulated outflows",
    "where the current returns through the jet we found that the flow is effectively collimated also in the outer , return - current region ( in this case by the electric force , which dominates the transverse magnetic force that acts to decollimate the flow in this regime ) .",
    "the efficient electromagnetic collimation in all of our computed jet models is evidently the reason why the presence of a rigid outer boundary does not induce recollimation shocks in the outflow even for the most rapidly converging wall shape ( @xmath239 ) .    in validating the basic features of the simplified semi - analytic solutions ,",
    "our numerical results go a long way toward establishing an `` mhd acceleration and collimation paradigm '' for relativistic astrophysical jets . in this contribution",
    "we applied this model to agn jets , for which there is already significant observational evidence of extended , @xmath240-scale acceleration ( possibly continuing to @xmath241 ) to lorentz factors @xmath19 .",
    "we demonstrated that , for plausible physical parameters , our simulated jets can reproduce these observations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we noted that these results could potentially apply also to the jets observed in galactic x - ray binary sources . in a future publication we will present simulation results for even higher initial magnetizations that could be used to model the ultrarelativistic jets in gamma - ray burst sources .",
    "future investigations will need to examine some of the complicating factors left out of the present study .",
    "in particular , the simplifying wall boundary condition will have to be replaced by the interaction of the outflow with its environment .",
    "furthermore , the questions of stability and energy dissipation will have to be addressed .",
    "in fact , given the potentially destructive role of the kink mode , fully 3d relativistic simulations will ultimately need to be carried out .",
    "in addition , the response of the jet to nonsteady conditions at the source  a potential cause of observed variability  will be an interesting topic for study .",
