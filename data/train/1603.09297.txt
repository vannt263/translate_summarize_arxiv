    "the power grid is designed to operate optimally at a nominal frequency and in a balanced fashion @xcite .",
    "large deviations from the nominal frequency , which typically occur as a result of mismatch between power generation and consumption , have adverse effects on the performance of different components of the grid , such as compensators and loads @xcite ; thus , making frequency stability as one of the most important factors in power quality @xcite .",
    "therefore , accurate frequency estimation is a prerequisite to establishing frequency stability in the grid and ensuring power quality .",
    "the need for accurate frequency estimation in power grids is even more profound when considering current trends in smart grid technology that incorporate distributed power generation based on renewable energy sources . in this setting",
    ", the wide - area grid is divided into a number of self contained sections called micro - grids , with some micro - grids becoming independent in power generation and disconnecting from the wide - area grid for prolonged lengths of time referred to as islanding .",
    "perfect synchrony is required to connect micro - grids and manage islanding ; consequently , many smart grid control and management techniques are dependent on accurate estimation of frequency under both balanced and unbalanced operating conditions @xcite .",
    "the importance of frequency estimation in power grids has motivated the introduction of a variety of algorithms for this purpose , including phase - locked loops ( pll ) @xcite-@xcite , recursive newton - type frequency estimation algorithms @xcite , fourier transform - based methods @xcite , state space frequency estimation algorithms established on the kalman and extended kalman filters @xcite-@xcite , and adaptive notch filter for direct estimation of frequency and its rate of change @xcite . however",
    ", these techniques are either based on using the information of a single phase and can not fully characterize three - phase systems @xcite , especially during crucial moments where one or two of the phases encounter a sudden drop in voltage or short circuit referred to as voltage sags @xcite-@xcite , or are based on standard complex linear models that are shown to experience large oscillatory errors at twice the frequency of the system when the three - phase system is unbalanced @xcite,@xcite .    in order to introduce a robust frequency estimator for both balanced an unbalanced power systems , the clarke transform and widely linear modeling of complex - valued signals",
    "have been used in @xcite , where an algorithm based on the augmented least mean square ( aclms ) adaptive filter has been presented .",
    "the clarke transform and widely linear modeling have also been used in @xcite to present a frequency estimator based on the augmented complex kalman filter ( ackf ) that outperforms aclms based methods .    an important development in smart grid technology is the recent introduction communication standards that allow measurement units to exchange information with their neighboring units over the power grid without the need for a dedicated communication infrastructure @xcite .",
    "although frequency should be estimated locally , the ability to share information with neighboring nodes can be explored to enhance the performance of frequency estimators specially in small networks , such as micro - grids . a number of distributed signal processing strategies based on the lms @xcite-@xcite , aclms @xcite , and kalman @xcite filtering algorithms have been introduced ; furthermore , a frequency estimator for three - phase power distribution networks based on the diffusion - aclms that employs single - hop communication has been presented in @xcite . however , these distributed estimation algorithms do not account for the low average number of connections per node in power distribution networks and consider all nodes of the network to be suffering from the same voltage sag .",
    "a robust frequency estimator for three - phase power systems has been developed based on the complex valued widely linear adaptive filtering by the author and his colleges in  @xcite . in this work",
    ", the frame work has been expanded to the distributed setting to address the implementation of such a frequency estimator in power distribution networks tacking into account practical considerations raised in this section . for rigor , the contribution of the distributed estimation strategy to the mean and mean - squared error performance of the developed algorithm is analyzed .",
