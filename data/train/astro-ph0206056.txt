    "photometric redshift estimation is a powerful tool in extragalactic astronomy , and significant effort has been expended in recent years developing robust redshift estimation techniques .",

    "we focus on x - ray luminous objects , asking whether a self - consistent technique can be devised to obtain photometric redshifts for x - ray selected samples .",
    "recent work on deep _ chandra _ fields indicates that the resolved x - ray background is comprised of a variety of objects , including early - type ellipticals , starburst galaxies , obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , narrow- and broad - line agn , and quasars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "given the disparate nature of these sources , the effectiveness of photometric redshifts is _ a priori _ unclear .",
    "recent spectroscopic observations in the _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - n ) highlight this concern .",
    "@xcite find that , out of a sample of 182 hard sources ( 2 - 8 kev detections ) with spectroscopic follow - up , approximately half show signatures of agn activity in their spectra .",
    "as argued by @xcite , one can reasonably expect that traditional galaxy spectral template fitting should be reliable for the 50% of sources that lack",
    "an agn spectral signature .",
    "similarly , it is likely that quasar spectral templates can be utilized for agn - dominated sources ( although this expectation has not yet been verified ) .",
    "it is unclear though whether either approach is robust for the intermediate sources in which both the agn and the galaxy stellar population contribute significantly to the optical spectrum .",
    "do photometric redshifts based upon galaxy spectral template fitting gradually degrade with increasing fractional luminosity contribution from the agn , or do they remain robust until the agn contribution reaches some critical level ?",
    "the _ hubble _ deep field , which is the canonical field for testing photometric redshifts , offers little insight .",
    "there are only six x - ray luminous sources with spectroscopic redshifts in the hdf  the majority of which are low - luminosity .",
    "photometric redshift comparisons in the hdf , such as the blind check of @xcite , thus can not test the reliability of photometric redshift estimators in the interesting regime of properties.1 ms _ chandra _ catalogs of @xcite . ]",
    "there are strong practical motivations for using an expanded sample of x - ray selected sources to assess the reliability of photometric redshifts for these objects .",
    "foremost , an efficient means of redshift estimation is required to maximize the return from large area _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys , such as the lockman hole survey ( _ chandra _ , pi : barger ) , the _ chandra _ multiwavelength project ( champ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the _ xmm-_lss survey @xcite , and the upcoming _ chandra _ survey in the noao deep - wide field ( 9 sq .",
    "degrees , pis : jones & murray ) .",
    "a number of the issues that these surveys aim to address , such as evolution in the agn x - ray luminosity    function and evolution in the correlation function of faint x - ray sources , are statistical in nature and do not require the accuracy of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "for example , the survey in the noao deep wide field aims to study the x - ray spatial correlation function using an expected @xmath32200 sources ( c. jones 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "this project has no associated large spectroscopic program and will depend upon the use of photometric redshifts to achieve its key scientific goal .",
    "if one can attain a level of accuracy for these photometric redshifts comparable to what is achieved for `` normal '' galaxies , photometric redshifts will be a valuable tool .",
    "if not , then the limitations of photometric redshift techniques must be established .    in this paper",
    "we assess the validity of photometric redshifts in the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey field ( cfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the @xcite catalog of x - ray sources in the cdf - n .",
    "we first compare the scatter in photometric redshift estimates for x - ray selected sources with a control sample of quiescent galaxies , and quantify the fraction of x - ray sources with bright optical counterparts for which traditional galaxy spectral template fitting is valid .",
    "next , we search for trends between the redshift residuals and other physical quantities , testing whether there is a range in x - ray luminosity ( @xmath11 ) or flux ratio ( @xmath2 ) over which photometric redshifts degrade . finally , we ask whether the objects for which photometric redshifts are likely to fail ( e.g. quasars ) can be easily identified using the optical photometry .",
    "the data are described in  [ sec : data ] and the results are presented in  [ sec : photoz ] . in  [ sec : summary ] we summarize our work and discuss prospects for future studies with larger and fainter samples .",
    "we assume @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "we focus on the cfgrs field due to the multiwavelength observations and extensive spectroscopy available for this region . we include in our sample x - ray sources detected by @xcite that lie within the cfgrs , have published spectroscopic redshifts , and have unambiguous optical counterparts .",
    "the @xcite source list is derived from the 975.3 ks _",
    "image of the _ chandra _ deep field north ( cdf - n ) , with minimum detectable fluxes near the aim point corresponding to @xmath15 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath5 in the hard band ( 2 - 8 kev ) and @xmath16 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath5 in the soft band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts @xcite and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 photometry @xcite exist for 66 of these sources , which are listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "for the majority of these objects the spectra are also published in figure 6 of @xcite .    of the 66 sources , only four are in the hdf proper and",
    "have previous published photometric redshifts using 7-color _ hst _ photometry . for one galaxy ,",
    "hdf 36569_1302 , @xcite dispute the spectroscopic redshift , arguing that the published value is attributable to the halo of a nearby , brighter galaxy .",
    "due to this uncertainty , we exclude hdf 36569_1302 from our analysis , yielding a final sample of 65 sources .",
    "figure [ fig : scatter ] shows the distribution of optical and x - ray properties in our subsample , compared to properties of the rest of the extragalactic sources from @xcite that lie within the cfgrs region .",
    "our subsample includes 80% of the extragalactic sources with optical counterparts brighter than @xmath21 ( 90% with counterparts brighter than @xmath22 ) . since spectroscopic redshifts are lacking for sources with @xmath23 we are unable to study this subset of the population , which includes the majority of faint x - ray sources with high @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize that the results presented in this paper are not necessarily applicable to these sources .",
    "we utilize the bayesian photometric redshift code of @xcite , bpz , to derive photometric redshifts for our sample .",
    "this code employs spectral template fitting , but also takes into account the @xmath24band magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "specifically , the code utilizes the f814 magnitude distribution of the hubble field as a bayesian prior probability distribution , which enables superior discrimination when color degeneracies exist between low- and high - redshift galaxies . for the current analysis",
    "we have only four filters , so the bayesian magnitude prior is necessary to break these color degeneracies and minimize the number of spurious outliers .",
    "our results should be valid for any code that utilizes spectral template fitting though , and to verify this expectation we also derive photometric redshifts using another publicly available code , hyperz @xcite . while bpz is more robust to outliers for our data set ,",
    "we confirm with hyperz that our results are insensitive to which photometric code is used .",
    "the standard six spectral templates described in @xcite are used for this analysis .",
    "four are based upon spectral energy distributions ( sed s ) in @xcite ( e / s0 , sbc , scd , and irr ) , and two are derived from spectra for starburst galaxies in @xcite .",
    "one challenge for the current analysis is that we lack @xmath25-band data for comparison with the hdf magnitude priors .",
    "fortunately , the code is not strongly sensitive to errors in the @xmath25-band magnitude used for the prior , so we make the coarse assumption that @xmath26 ( comparable to an elliptical galaxy at @xmath27 ) for all galaxies in the sample .",
    "we also test the code with @xmath28 , finding that the choice of fiducial color yields a negligible difference in estimated redshifts .",
    "we employ a two - part approach in deriving photometric redshifts .",
    "a necessary first step is to identify objects with quasar - dominated spectra at optical wavelengths , since photometric redshifts based upon galaxy spectral templates are likely to fail for these sources .",
    "if these objects can be identified , then photometric redshifts can potentially be derived for them by other means ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to this end , we construct a quasar template using the optical sdss composite spectrum of @xcite , coupled with infrared spectra of pds 456 from @xcite . for the sdss composite",
    ", we apply a correction for stellar contamination , assuming that the contamination increases linearly from 10% at 6000@xmath29 to 30% at 8500@xmath29 , which is based upon estimates in @xcite .",
    "the resulting template is shown in figure [ fig : qsotemplate ] .",
    "we initially include this quasar spectral template in the sed library and run the photometric redshift code without the bayesian prior .",
    "six of the 65 sources in our sample , including the two highest redshift sources , is not a quasar , then it will be optically faint and likely not have been targeted for spectroscopy . ] are best fit by the quasar spectrum .",
    "one of these sources has previously been identified as a quasar @xcite ; a second was identified by @xcite as a bl agn .",
    "we exclude these six sources from the subsequent analysis , but record the photometric redshift estimates and include them in subsequent figures . for the remaining 59 x - ray sources , all of which are at @xmath30",
    ", we perform a second iteration of the redshift estimation in which we exclude the quasar spectrum and include the bayesian magnitude priors .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : zphot]@xmath31 .",
    "we derive a scatter @xmath32 for these sources .",
    "@xcite provide spectroscopic redshifts for a total of 529 galaxies in the @xcite photometric catalog , enabling construction of an x - ray quiet comparison sample . excluding the _ chandra _ sources and galaxies at @xmath33 , the redshift dispersion for this catalog is @xmath34 .",
    "this scatter is dominated by a handful of outliers  if we employ @xmath35-clipping with rejection of outliers beyond 3.5@xmath35 , then 11 out of 461 galaxies are rejected and the dispersion reduces to @xmath36 .",
    "this value is larger than the scatter for the hdf ( @xmath37 for 7 filters ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but not unreasonable given the larger photometric uncertainties and smaller number of passbands in this analysis .",
    "comparing with the x - ray subsample , we conclude that , with the exception of clearly quasar - dominated sources , the dispersion in photometric redshifts is no greater for x - ray sources than for the field galaxy population .",
    "to verify these results , we also derive photometric redshifts using hyperz .",
    "the hyperz code was utilized by @xcite , who concluded that the lack of priors coupled with their lack of @xmath38band data significantly hindered the reliability of their photo-@xmath39 s .",
    "our comparison of bpz and hyperz confirms that the inclusion of a magnitude prior significantly improves the robustness , particularly with a limited number of passbands . with hyperz , 12% of the sources in the quiescent sample  and a comparable fraction of the x - ray luminous sources  are outliers with @xmath40 .",
    "in contrast , only 2% of sources in the quiescent sample are outliers with bpz .",
    "nonetheless , if these outliers are excluded , then hyperz and bpz typically yield consistent photometric redshifts for individual x - ray selected sources ( figure [ fig : hyperz ] ) .",
    "though . ] furthermore , hyperz yields dispersions comparable to bpz , with values @xmath36 for the full field sample and @xmath41 for the x - ray sources",
    ". both codes thus    indicate that the dispersion is comparable for the x - ray luminous and quiescent samples .",
    "the results of the preceding sections indicate that photometric redshifts are robust for @xmath390% of x - ray sources with @xmath42 down to @xmath43 erg s@xmath1 @xmath5 , including some sources with a moderate agn contribution .",
    "one naively expects increased scatter in the photometric redshifts with increasing optical contribution from the agn .",
    "a direct test of this expectation would require fitting a linear superposition of normal galaxy and quasar spectral templates to obtain the fractional contribution , which is beyond the scope of the current analysis .",
    "instead , we ask whether the probability of failure is correlated with the x - ray properties of the source  specifically the x - ray luminosity and the ratio of x - ray to optical flux ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the latter quantity is the best analog measure of the relative agn and starlight contributions , but with the caveat that there exists a factor of ten range in @xmath2 within which sources can be either agn or starlight dominated .    in figure",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] we plot @xmath44 against @xmath11 , where @xmath45 , to assess whether the redshift estimates degrade above some threshold luminosity . aside from objects that are best fit by the quasar spectral template",
    ", there is no indication of degradation up to @xmath46 erg s@xmath1 , the luminosity of the brightest non - quasar - dominated sources in our sample .",
    "we also find no statistically significant trend with @xmath2 ( figure [ fig : fxfr ] ) ; however , the probability of identifying a source as quasar - dominated increases significantly for sources with @xmath47 .",
    "nearly 30% of sources above this threshold ( 5 of 18 ) are best fit by the quasar template , as opposed to only one of 47 at lower @xmath2 .",
    "these results imply , somewhat surprisingly that the photometric redshift estimates are fairly insensitive to the presence of an agn unless the agn dominates the optical spectrum .",
    "we use a sample of x - ray sources detected by _",
    "chandra _ in the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey region to test the robustness of photometric redshifts for these objects .",
    "for the 59 out of 65 sources with colors that are not best fit by a quasar spectral template , we find no degradation in the accuracy of photometric redshifts as compared to the field galaxy population .",
    "we also find that the redshift residuals exhibit no trend as a function of x - ray luminosity or @xmath2 for these sources .",
    "we demonstrate that it is feasible to quickly identify objects whose spectra are quasar - dominated at optical wavelengths and derive robust photometric redshifts for the other @xmath48% of sources that have optical counterparts brighter that @xmath49 , which includes roughly two thirds of all sources with @xmath50 erg s@xmath1 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "consequently , photometric redshift estimation should be a valuable tool for upcoming large samples of optically bright , x - ray selected objects .",
    "this paper is a first step towards quantifying the robustness of photometric redshifts for systems in the transition regime between quiescent galaxies and quasars .",
    "the next required step is extension to fainter optical magnitudes . given that the majority of fainter sources have high @xmath2 , it is unclear whether photometric redshifts will be as effective for this population , but the motivation for testing their robustness is strong .",
    "there is speculation that these optically faint , high @xmath2 sources possibly include obscured agn at @xmath51 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and photometric redshifts may be the only viable approach for studying this population .",
