    "the recent detection of @xmath0-rays from several broad - line radio galaxies ( blrgs : 3c  120 , 3c  111 , and pictor  a ) by _ fermi_/lat telescope ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) constituted this sub - class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as high energy emitters . together with radio galaxies such as m87 @xcite or cen  a @xcite seen by _",
    "fermi_/lat earlier they form an interesting group of agn where high energy radiation is observed despite the absence of strong doppler boosting as we observe in typical blazars",
    ". these non - blazar agn ( dubbed `` misaligned blazars '' ) , although much fainter due to geometrical effects , are very interesting objects as they reveal both accretion disk radiation ( at least in case of blrgs ) and jet emission in their broadband spectra",
    ".    from infrared to hard x - rays blrgs show typical thermal emission related to accretion disk around super - massive black hole , which can be further divided into direct accretion disk radiation peaking in optical wavelengths , dusty torus infrared emission and power law non - thermal x - ray component most probably originating from disk corona ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "non - thermal radio and @xmath0-ray emission is thought to originate from relativistic jet and is being only weakly doppler boosted due to large viewing angles @xmath2 .",
    "3c  120 is a nearby ( @xmath3 ) blrg with fanaroff - riley type i radio morphology @xcite .",
    "the source has been actively monitored in all wavebands from radio up to x - rays and recent detection by _",
    "@xcite made it possible to study accretion disk and jet interaction by modelling its broadband spectra .    in this article",
    "we present detailed data analysis of high energy data for the whole _",
    "fermi_/lat dataset ( @xmath1  years ) and we especially focus our attention on two major outbursts that happened in september 2014 and april 2015 .",
    "we study both temporal and spectral properties of these flares .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] we present the details and results of _",
    "fermi_/lat data analysis . in section  [ sec : dis ] we present discussion concerning the location of the @xmath0-ray emission region ( the `` blazar zone '' ) , the adopted `` spine - layer '' jet model as well as details on spectral modelling . summary and",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "the 3c  120 @xmath0-ray spectra and light curves within  100  mev to 100  gev energy range were obtained by analysing about  @xmath4  years of _",
    "fermi_/lat data from august  4th , 2008 to may  26th , 2015 ( hereafter : all _ fermi_/lat data ) .",
    "we reduced the data using _ fermi _ science tools package version ` v9r33p0 ` selecting only ` source ` class 2 events and using ` p7rep_source_v15 ` instrument response function . given a rather soft spectrum of 3c  120 and a large instrument point spread function ( @xmath5 at @xmath6  mev ) we selected events within @xmath7 ( roi ) from nominal source radio position ( r.a.=@xmath8 , dec.=@xmath9 ) to properly model the contribution of other sources .",
    "to avoid contamination form earth s limb photons we also applied a zenith angle  @xmath10 cut .",
    "we used the standard ` gtlike ` tool to model the roi using maximum likelihood method @xcite .",
    "model includes 69 point sources from lat 4-year point source catalog ( 3fgl , @xcite ) as well as galactic and isotropic diffusion emission templates .",
    "we model both flux normalisation and power law spectral index for sources within a radius of @xmath11 from the roi centre .",
    "other sources within the roi are fixed to their 3fgl values .",
    "after initial fit , all sources with test statistics ( ts ) lower than  @xmath12 were excluded from the model and the procedure was repeated until convergence .",
    "two sources in the 3fgl are located fairly close to 3c  120  i.e.  3fgl j0432.5 + 0539 and 3fgl j0426.6 + 0459 .",
    "the latter is @xmath13 away yet the former is only @xmath14 away from the source of interest having photon index of @xmath15 which makes distinction between the two sources unclear .",
    "however , by fitting @xmath0-ray 3c  120 position @xcite found that it lies @xmath16 from its radio position . also , 3fgl",
    "j0432.5 + 0539 lat position was determined with a @xmath17 error of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we include all three sources in the model treating them as separate .    for the whole dataset ( all data ) we used binned likelihood method .",
    "3c  120 was detected with @xmath19 , a @xmath20 flux of @xmath21 and a power law photon index @xmath22 .",
    "we calculated light curve and spectra by dividing the data into time bins ( 30-days , 83 bins ) or energy bins ( 6 equal bins in logarithmic scale covering the chosen energy range ) , and by applying previous procedure to model the roi with both flux normalisation and power law index as free parameters . in case",
    "the ts value was lower than 9 ( corresponding to significance @xmath23 ) @xmath17 upper limits were calculated assuming power law index of @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ fig : base_spectra ] presents source @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : base_lc ] presents 3c  120 light curve . source was observed with significance larger that @xmath24 several times in recent years .",
    "we focus our attention on two recent outbursts : in september 2014 ( hereafter : flare 1 ; reported by @xcite ) and in april 2015 ( hereafter : flare 2 ; reported by @xcite ) . to analyse _",
    "fermi_/lat data during flare 1 and 2 periods we used unbinned likelihood analysis method to properly account for low photon count numbers . during flare 1 in september 2014 ( 30-days of data ) 3c  120 was observed with @xmath25 , power law photon index @xmath26 and its @xmath17 flux upper limit was estimated as @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ fig : flare14_lc ] ( left panel ) presents light curve for september 2014 with clear flux increase on 24th september .",
    "right panel of the same figure presents light curve for that day with 2-hour time bins . on 24th september 3c",
    "120 was detected with @xmath28 with photon flux @xmath29 and power law index of @xmath30 .",
    "even for the 2-hour highest flux time bin @xmath31 indicating detection above @xmath32 significance level .",
    "we applied the same procedure to investigate flare 2 . figure  [ fig : flare15_lc ] presents monthly ( 1-day time bin ) and daily ( 30-minutes time bin ) light curves for april 2015 and 24th april 2015 , respectively .",
    "monthly averaged flux is @xmath33 with power law index @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and daily averaged flux for 24th april is @xmath36 with power law index @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "source was also detected within 30-minutes time bin with large @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ fig : flare_spectra ] presents flares 1  and  2 @xmath0-ray spectra averaged over outburst day and shortest time bin with detection above @xmath40 i.e. 2 hours for flare 1 and 30 minutes for flare 2 .        for flaring periods we additionally checked whether they could be associated with nearby sources 3fgl j0432.5 + 0539 and 3fgl j0426.6 + 0459 .",
    "light curve analysis for these sources indicated no correlation between their flux increase and presented 3c  120 outbursts .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] summarises _ fermi_/lat data analysis results .    [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : param ]",
    "_ fermi_/lat data analysis suggests that although it is a rather faint @xmath0-ray source it is worth monitoring especially as it occasionally shows very luminous flares .",
    "detailed data analysis of two recently reported outbursts ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : base_lc ] ) proved not only extraordinary @xmath0-ray flux increase ( by a factor of @xmath41 for flare 1 and @xmath42 in case of flare 2 ) but also very short timescales of this phenomenon .",
    "as we argue in section 3.2 it is rather impossible to explain these factors with a one - zone emission model .",
    "we demonstrated that an introduction of the fast , narrow and wiggling spine component is a model which meets all the required properties .",
    "such model proves to be very robust in explaining 3c  120 flaring behaviour as it can account for powerful @xmath0-ray flux increases without significant flux changes in other wavelengths while keeping the emission region small .",
    "model robustness is also strengthened by the fact that the introduction of second jet component does not lead to doubling of model parameters .",
    "indeed , the spine - layer scenario introduces only two additional model parameters : the spine lorentz factor @xmath43 and its opening angle @xmath44 .",
    "however , these parameters are merely just spine flux normalisation constants and there is a need for a viable theoretical model that could put constraints on their values and relations towards other jet properties",
    ".    positive detection for time bins as short as one hour ( or even less in case of flare 2 ) must lead to extremely small emitting zone if interpreted as coherent emission from localised active region in a horizontally uniform jet .",
    "this observation inevitably localises the @xmath0-ray active region very close to the central bh unless the jet is very fast and pointing towards the observer which leads to high doppler factors and , therefore , emission region in the jet co moving frame is much larger .    we model the 3c  120 sed assuming its total radiation consists of the accretion - related and jet - related components .",
    "in case of all data , averaged _ fermi_/lat spectrum can be explained as having pure ssc origin @xcite or as being dominated by erc radiation making use of strong blr and hdr radiation in the jet environment .",
    "note that neither of these models is favoured as the choice between the dominant @xmath0-ray production mechanism is very dependent on the doppler factor and observations indicate that this value is highly variable .",
    "@xcite claims that the observed @xmath0-ray flux depends not only on the energetics of emission region but also on the changing jet orientation with respect to the observer .",
    "this observation supports the idea of the `` wiggling '' jet .",
    "we note that , although such conclusion has been made by analysing vlbi radio data , the same conclusion may be true in the case of the fast , narrow spine . in general , both the layer and the spine may change their directions , but due to large difference in their lorentz factors observational effects are much more prominent in the case of the spine .",
    "we model 3c  120 flares 1  and  2 by varying spine s lorentz factor and by changing its direction towards the observer .",
    "the increase of @xmath45 factor in spine by four times , in case of flare 1 , and by eight times , in the case of flare 2 , with respect to the average value of @xmath46 are enough to properly reproduce the observed @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "we note that this applies not only to flux normalisation but also reproduces the @xmath0-ray spectral shape . during flares",
    "3c  120 @xmath0-ray spectrum was much harder ( @xmath47 ) that the averaged value ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the characteristic energy of blr photons ( @xmath49 ) and hdr photons ( @xmath50 ) together with calculated electron distribution spectral brake @xmath51 and shift towards higher energies by larger @xmath43 localises the erc(blr+hdr ) spectral peak in the right position matching the observations .",
    "we also point out that both in all data spectra and during flares 3c  120 is visible by _ fermi_/lat only up to energies of about several gevs .",
    "this may indicate that a part of the high energy radiation is absorbed via @xmath52 pair production on dense blr photon field .",
    "the calculated powers carried by spine and layer in the form of kinetic energy of cold protons and poynting flux indicate that majority of the total jet energy is contained in the layer .",
    "this is in contrast to models proposed by @xcite where most of the total jet power was carried by the spine exceeding layer s power by at least several times .",
    "spine lorentz factors proposed by our modelling are much different from average value of @xmath46 so they are different from each other .",
    "we point out that the proposed model which assumes different @xmath43 factors for flares 1  and  2 is not unique  i.e.  it is possible to get similar results with different set of input parameters .",
    "it is especially important to notice that the observed radiation is very sensitive to assumed doppler factors , hence , the direction of the fast spine towards the observer .",
    "it is very plausible that both flares could be modelled with identical spine lorentz factor with different direction towards the observer as the main reason for different observed @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
    "another way of having such extreme values in a single source is that the spine - layer model might be just a coarse simplification and yet an indication of a much more complex jet structure . instead of a sharp division into fast and slow components one may think of a smooth transition from slower , outer parts of the jet towards faster , inner regions  e.g.  described by a gaussian profile @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the distance from the jet axis .",
    "depending on the broadness of such gaussian @xmath45 factors distribution observed radiation could be characterised by different @xmath55 ratio .",
    "also the variability of this ratio would be very sensitive on the jet @xmath53 profile  i.e.  small short - term @xmath0-ray variability would indicate rather broad profile while rapid , powerful high energy flares could be explained with peaked , narrow distribution similar to model proposed in this work . however , detailed and quantitative model of such proposition is required to assess its validity .",
    "this research has made use of the maxi data provided by riken , jaxa and the maxi team .",
