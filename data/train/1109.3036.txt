    "vy canis majoris ( ) is one of most massive and luminous red hypergiant stars in our galaxy . at",
    "its `` traditional '' estimated distance of 1.5 kpc , based on the angular proximity to the cluster ngc 2362  @xcite ,  would be near the empirical upper luminosity boundary in the hertzsprung - russel ( h - r ) diagram  @xcite , associated with high mass - loss and ejection phenomena . because the red hypergiant phase represents a very short - lived evolutionary stage , with a timescale of only @xmath5 years , the physical properties and evolutional state of this object have been investigated extensively from optical and infrared to radio wavelengths .",
    "displays oh ,  and sio maser emission in its circumstellar envelope ( cse ) . very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of sio masers from oxygen - rich asymptotic giant branch stars ( e.g. , mira variables ) have shown that the masers are situated only a few radii from the stellar surface , giving us insight into the properties of the inner cse , which is important for the study of the evolution of late type stars  @xcite .",
    "investigations of the distributions of the sio masers show that the masers typically form ring - like structures  @xcite , possibly with a rotational component  @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations of sio maser emission from  in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 transitions showed them to be approximately spatially coincident , with extents of approximately 80  mas on the sky and the strongest spots concentrated toward the east  @xcite .",
    "vlbi maps of the @xmath7 , @xmath9 maser emission extend over about 100 @xmath10 80 mas in right ascension and declination , respectively , estimated at about 2@xmath44 stellar radii  @xcite .",
    "knowledge of distance is very important to determine the physical properties of a star .",
    "inferred stellar radii depend directly on distance and luminosities scale as the square of distance ; moreover , distances indirectly affect modeled stellar properties , such as effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "recently , @xcite measured a trigonometric parallax for  of @xmath11 mas , corresponding to a distance of @xmath12 kpc , based on observations of  masers with the japanese vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) array . at this distance",
    ",  more comfortably falls below the theoretical maximum luminosity on the hr diagram .",
    "our parallax measurements presented here are made with a different telescope , the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , observing a different maser species ( sio ) and thus give an independent measurement of the distance and proper motion of .    while stellar positions for red giant stars have been measured with the hipparcos satellite , these are generally far less accurate than for dwarf stars , since red giant stars are large , variable , often surrounded by copious dust and far away .",
    "another way to locate a red giant star is to observe circumstellar masers with radio interferometry  @xcite .",
    "because masers usually surround the red giant star , the radio position of the central star can be estimated from the observed distribution and kinematics of the sio masers , which can be linked to the positions of extragalactic quasars by vlbi phase - referencing  @xcite . more directly",
    ", however , radio continuum emission from the stellar photosphere can be imaged by , for example , the very large array ( vla ) using  or sio masers as a phase - reference  @xcite , which provides a direct and accurate measurement of the maser distribution relative to the star .    in this paper , we present the results from our multi - epoch radio interferometer observations of the sio maser emission and radio continuum toward . in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we describe the vlba phase - referencing observations of sio masers and the vla observations of weak radio photospheric continuum and maser emission at 43 ghz made on the day after the second epoch of our vlba observations . in  [ sec : int_mot ] , we compare the spatial distribution of sio masers at different epochs and estimate their internal motions . in ",
    "[ sec : para ] , we use the time variation of the positions of maser spots relative to a background source to determine a trigonometric parallax and absolute proper motion . in  [ sec : abs_pos ] , we describe the procedures to determine the absolute position of the central star based on the quasi - ring - like structure of maser distributions from the vlba observations and the vla observations of radio photospheric emission using strong maser emission as phase - reference . in ",
    "[ sec : kin_mod ] , after modeling the kinematics of masers , we derive an absolute proper motion of the star . in  [ sec : disc ] , we compare the positions and proper motions with values measured by the hipparcos satellite and vera , and discuss the reasons for the difference and the origin of .",
    "our vlbi observations were conducted with the vlba operated by the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) under program br106 .",
    "we observed the @xmath7 , @xmath13 sio maser transition at a rest frequency of 43.12208 ghz toward  with 8-hour tracks on 2005 october 20 , 2006 april 16 and september 29 , and 2007 april 14 .",
    "this time sampling provides nearly maximum sensitivity for parallax detection and ensures that we can separate the secular proper motion from the sinusoidal parallax effect .",
    "we scheduled the observations so as to maximize the right ascension ( and not declination ) parallax offsets for two reasons .",
    "first , for  the amplitude of the parallax signature in right ascension is greater than in declination .",
    "second , since  is observed at low elevation angles , the uncertainty of declination measurements would be expected to be considerably larger than for right ascension @xcite .",
    "we observed several extragalactic radio sources as potential background references for parallax solutions .",
    "the observing sequence was , , , , , , ,  for the first epoch .",
    "from the first epoch observations , we found  and  too weak to be detected , and we dropped these sources from the remaining observations .",
    "we switched between the maser target and background sources every 40  s , typically achieving 30  s of on - source data .",
    "we used an sio maser spot as the phase - reference source because it is considerable stronger than the background source and could be detected on individual baselines in the available on - source time .",

    "we have measured the trigonometric parallax and proper motion of from vlba observations of the variations of relative positions between 43 ghz sio masers and the background source .",
    "the parallax of 0.83 @xmath0 0.08 mas provides a distance of @xmath16 kpc , which is consistent with that measured with 22 ghz  maser using the vera by @xcite .",
    "there can be little doubt that  is nearer than the value of 1.5 kpc generally used in the literature .    using the vla detection of the radio photosphere , using the sio masers as a phase reference , we determined the position of the central star relative to the sio masers .",
    "this position is consistent with that estimated from the distribution of maser spots with an uncertainty better than 10 mas .",
    "we found there are several spoke - like maser features ; most of these could be modeled by ballistic orbits , suggesting that most spoke - like maser features are on the far side of the star , are decelerating , pointing back to the central star .",
    "the kinematics of sio maser spots show a slow expansion . after removing the effects of expansion , we derived an absolute proper motion of the central star . a large discrepancy of tens of mas between the positions of  determined by optical and radio measurements is found , and we suggest that optical position determinations are affected by the scattering from circumstellar dust and can not be used to locate the star or its motion .",
