    "in contrast in the @xmath46=130 mass region , the centroid energies of the @xmath100 and @xmath101 components are close to each other .",
    "in such a situation , the experimental strength might not show the typical double hump pattern usually associated with a deformed nucleus .",
    "let us notice that similar @xmath23 hierarchy has also been obtained for quadrupole resonances @xcite .",

    "[ sec_mod ] , this shift already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is expected since our qrpa calculations do not account for the effects related to @xmath2 configurations involving more than 2-@xmath2 states or to the phonon coupling .",
    "nevertheless , the mass dependence of the centroid energy follows particularly well the experimental trend , a feature particularly striking in the rare earth region .",
    "this systematic overestimation can be removed by a global ( @xmath32 mev ) shift of the states involved in the response .",
    "furthermore a systematic @xmath32 mev downward energy shift should reduce the d1 m ewsrs ( around @xmath31.5 trk units ) to reach the experimental values which rarely exceed 1.3 trk units .",
    "the qrpa provides a rather satisfactory description of the gdr centroid and the fraction of the ewsr exhausted by the @xmath0 mode .",
    "however the gdr is known experimentally to have a relatively large width and therefore a finite lifetime and for a proper description of experimental data , it is necessary to go beyond the qrpa scheme .",
    "different microscopic theories ( such as second rpa and particle - phonon coupling ) explain the location and width of the gdr . for the sake of simplicity and applicability to a large number of nuclei of astrophysical interest , we restrict ourselves to the semi - empirical broadening of the gdr already introduced in sec .

    "the latter correction therefore varies with the excitation energy @xmath109 and obviously depends on the nucleus considered .",

    "[ fig_fe1_d1m_sn]-[fig_fe1_sn ] between the various @xmath1-ray strength predictions for nuclei far from the valley of stability may also have a significant impact on the predicted neutron - capture cross section of astrophysical interest . in order to investigate this point ,",
    "the maxwellian - averaged neutron capture rate are calculated with the talys code @xcite using the @xmath1-ray strength obtained with the three prescribed d1m+qrpa models as well as with the glo @xcite and skyrme - hfb+qrpa modelsl @xcite .",
    "note that , for consistency , in the present calculation of the radiative neutron capture rates , the d1 m masses @xcite and the hfb plus combinatorial nuclear level densities based on the d1 m single - particle and pairing properties @xcite are adopted .",
    "figure [ fig_ng_sn ] shows the maxwellian - averaged neutron capture rate of the sn isotopes for models 1 and 2 ( left panel ) and glo and skyrme - hfb+qrpa ( right panel ) with respect to the model 0 predictions used as a reference . as can be seen on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_ng_sn ] , the three prescriptions used to fold the original d1m+qrpa strength predict radiative neutron capture rates within a factor of 2 , even for the most exotic nuclei . similarly , the reaction rates obtained using the d1m+qrpa strengths agree rather well with those based on the skyrme - hfb plus qrpa along the whole isotopic chain .",
    "this similarity can be explained by the rather same strength predicted at low energies below the gdr , although the gogny calculation predicts a strength spread on a much wider energy range .",
    "however , for exotic neutron - rich sn isotopes our present qrpa @xmath1-ray strength is seen to give rise to reaction rates that can be about 30 times larger than those obtained with the glo model .",
    "k ) for the sn isotopes obtained with the three present d1m+qrpa models ; right panel : same where the neutron capture rate with model 0 of the d1m+qrpa strength is compared with the one obtained with the glo model ( squares ) @xcite and to the one predicted with the skyrme - hfb+qrpa model based on the bsk7 force ( circles ) @xcite . ]",
    "large scale calculations of @xmath0 @xmath1-ray strength functions for even - even nuclei have been undertaken within the axially - symmetric - deformed hfb+qrpa approach in a fully consistent way using the finite - range gogny interaction .",
    "the convergence of the numerical calculation has been analyzed with respect to the size of the basis ( number of ho shells ) and the 2-@xmath2 excitation energy .",
    "this analysis allowed to establish practical choices for large scale calculations optimizing both the minimization of the computational cost and the convergence .",
    "predictions obtained for two parameter sets of the gogny interaction , namely d1s and d1 m , have been compared and shown to give rise to a similar global behaviour .",
    "nevertheless , the d1 m @xmath0 strength is found to be systematically shifted , leading to lower centroid energy and a smaller ewsr in comparison with d1s .",
    "the role of the intrinsic deformation has been systematically investigated .",
    "the split between @xmath23=0 and @xmath128=1 total angular momentum projections for deformed nuclei as well as their opposite hierarchy for prolate and oblate shapes has been confirmed in the whole nuclear chart .",
    "large deformations give rise to a double peak structure while small deformations lead to a split too small to be disentangled .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath0 @xmath1-ray strength for all even - even nuclei for which photoabsorption data exist .",
    "the comparison between qrpa and measured cross sections revealed a systematic energy shift of about @xmath32 mev of the gogny - qrpa strength with respect to experimental data . this energy shift ( of @xmath32 mev )",
    "induces that the theoretical values of the ewsr obtained for all the nuclei studied in the present work are systematically larger than the experimental ones .",
    "three prescriptions have been proposed to cure this discrepancy .",
    "they correspond to a folding procedure of the @xmath9 discrete distribution on the basis of a lorentzian function , which not only shifts the @xmath0 strength down by more or less 2  mev but also widen the distribution , as experimentally observed in photoabsorption cross sections .",
    "such a folding is also needed to produce @xmath119 strength functions as inputs in reaction models ( _ e.g. _ talys code ) .",
    "two of these prescriptions fit the experimental photoabsorption data by adjusting the width and energy shift parameters of the lorentzian , taking into account the density of dipole 4-@xmath2 excitations .",
    "this microscopic ingredient allows us to investigate effects beyond the standard qrpa description involving only 2-@xmath2 excitations .",
    "the three prescriptions are found to give a satisfactory description of experimental data and are shown to provide globally similar @xmath0 strength .",
    "in particular the neutron capture rates of astrophysical interest do not differ by more than a factor of 2 for the three prescriptions , even far away from the valley of @xmath6-stability .",
    "further improvements of the present approach can be envisioned .",
    "first , the interpolation procedure for odd nuclei can be replaced by a fully microscopic qrpa calculation of odd systems .",
    "second , the folding procedure can be improved by including microscopically the particle - phonon coupling .",
    "third , dynamic deformations can be considered when differing from the hfb one ( see _ e.g. _ fig .",
    "@xcite ) . the present encouraging results , in parallel to those obtained for nuclear masses @xcite and nuclear level densities @xcite , will allow us to include such microscopic ingredients ( obtained on the basis of one unique gogny interaction ) into cross sections calculations . we believe that working along such a path is a way , in the future , to improve cross section evaluations and predictions on the basis of reliable and accurate microscopic inputs .",
