    "the experimentally observed spectra of mesons and baryons should provide detailed information on quark confinement and other interquark forces , which are believed to result from qcd at low energies .",
    "thus , over the past four decades work on quark models has attempted to reproduce these spectra by employing confining potentials , which are usually of a coulomb - plus - linear or `` funnel '' type , on the basis of short - distance perturbative qcd and long - distance qcd speculations .",
    "a typical and often cited example is the relativised quark model of godfrey and isgur @xcite . in such approaches",
    ", it is generally assumed that hadronic decay can be treated _ a posteriori _ and perturbatively , with no appreciable influence on the spectrum itself . _ _",
    "however , very recent unquenched lattice calculations have shown the sizable effects of accouting for dynamical quarks and allowing hadrons to decay strongly .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite a lattice computation of @xmath0-wave @xmath1 phase shifts and the lowest strange vector - meson resonances was carried out , confirming @xmath2 and tentatively also @xmath3 , though the latter resonance came out about 80  mev below the experimental @xcite mass .",
    "more surprisingly , an equally unquenched calculation by the same lattice collaboration @xcite , yet without two - meson correlators and so no hadronic decay , predicted a ( bound ) @xmath3 state roughly 300  mev higher in mass . despite possible inaccuracies due to problems in dealing with inelastic resonances and very light quarks / pions on the lattice ,",
    "this enormous difference confirms the importance of including strong decay for reliable predictions in meson spectroscopy .",
    "moreover , in another study by still the same lattice group , the low mass of the charmed - strange @xmath4 meson was reproduced by including two - meson correlators corresponding to the subthreshold @xmath5-wave @xmath6 channel @xcite , in agreement with an unquenched quark - model description a decade earlier @xcite ( also see below ) .",
    "as already said , lattice qcd still faces considerable problems in dealing with resonances that have multiple decay modes and in extrapolating predictions towards the physical pion mass , besides serious difficulties in dealing with heavy quarkonia and excited states .",
    "therefore , in the foreseeable future qcd - inspired quark models will still be of a crucial importance in interpreting and advising on experiments in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "clearly , such models should go beyond the quenched approximation of the confinement - only approaches mentioned above .",
    "one attempt to do this in a `` cheap '' way amounted to estimating hadron - loop mass corrections in charmonium @xcite , and suggesting that to a large extent it might suffice to adjust the charm quark mass .",
    "however , this is most likely a too simplistic assessment , since the size of hadronic loop corrections will depend on the wave function of a specific state , in particular its nodal structure , in view of the peaked shape of the string - breaking interaction leading to decay , as confirmed on the lattice @xcite .",
    "furthermore , above the lowest decay threshold the effects will be governed by @xmath5-matrix unitarity and analyticity , which are generally non - perturbative and non - linear ( see the examples below ) , except for unphysically small couplings @xcite .",
    "another approach to mimicking unquenching in quark models is by screening the confining potential at larger interquark separations , making it in fact non - confining and so allowing for decay .",
    "however , such decays are pathological , as they lead to free quarks and not hadrons in the final state .",
    "of course , one can adjust the model parameters such that the thresholds for decay into free quarks lie above all experimentally observed states .",
    "however , then one would purport to describe physical resonances by treating them as stable hadrons , ignoring effects due to @xmath5-matrix analyticity and genuine decay thresholds .",
    "moreover , the usually employed screened potentials in quark models are , for short distances , similar to the funnel potential @xcite , as e.g.  in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which on top of that has interquark meson exchanges .",
    "thus , these models share some of the shortcomings @xcite of the godfrey - isgur model @xcite , such as much too large radial separations for the lowest states in the light - quark sector .    in this talk , we shall make the case for an @xmath5-matrix approach to meson spectroscopy , as the only reliable phenomenological way to unquench the quark model , describing both mesonic bound states and resonances in a unique analytic formalism , with meson - loop effects included to all orders .",
    "for that purpose published work on several enigmatic meson resonances will be briefly reviewed .",
    "the organisation is as follows : sec .  2 deals with the original model and the vector charmonium spectrum , sec .  3 with the light scalar mesons",
    "sec .  4 with the charmed scalars @xmath4 and @xmath7 , sec .  5 with the axial - vector charmonium state @xmath8 , and sec .  6 with the @xmath9 open - charm mesons",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "a few conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "r3 cm    the first three vector charmonium levels , discovered almost four decades ago , seem to suggest a confining potential with decreasing splittings for increasing radial quantum number .",
    "such a pattern can result from a power - law potential @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the simplest case is a linear potential , but also a funnel - type potential , which includes a coulombic piece , will do , as e.g.  in the model by godfrey and isgur @xcite .",
    "however , the coupled - channel model of ref .",
    "@xcite , employing an ho potential with constant frequency and a transition potential mimicking string breaking at a certain distance to describe ozi - allowed strong decay , leads to a similar result .",
    "figure  [ hovector ] shows schematically how the equidistant ho spectrum , with degenerate @xmath5 and @xmath16 states , is transformed into the physical charmonium spectrum by unquenching .",
    "moreover , even the first few bottomomium states are automatically reproduced @xcite .",
    "r6 cm    an extended version of the above unquenched ho model @xcite , with a smeared - out transition potential and relativistic kinematics in the open decay channels , was applied to heavy and light vector and pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .",
    "this very same model was then used , with unchanged parameters , to study scalar mesons made of light quarks @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath5-matrices revealed resonance poles not only in the expected 1.31.5 gev energy region , but also well below 1 gev .",
    "it comprised a complete extra scalar nonet , including the then still very controversial @xmath17 ( `` @xmath18 '' ) and @xmath19 ( `` @xmath20 '' ) mesons , with pole positions @xcite close to present - day world averages @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ pipis ] the model s parameter - free prediction of @xmath5-wave @xmath21 phase shifts is shown with old data .",
    "a momentum - space version @xcite of the above model @xcite was applied @xcite to the @xmath4 and @xmath7 @xcite charmed scalar mesons , in a very simple approximation for the lowest states , but with quark masses and ho frequency fixed at the values determined in ref .",
    "this very same model , with identical values for the overall coupling @xmath22 and the string - breaking distance @xmath23 , had been used before in an excellent fit @xcite to the @xmath5-wave @xmath1 phase shifts up to 1.5 gev , while simultaneusly reproducing the @xmath19 and @xmath24 @xcite resonances .",
    "the resulting @xcite pole trajectories as a function of @xmath22 are shown in fig .",
    "[ charmscalars ] , with an excellent prediction for @xmath4 .",
    "r5 cm    the @xmath25 charmonium state @xmath8 @xcite is a perfect laboratory for quark and effective models , as it is bound by only 0.11  mev with respect to its lowest ozi - allowed decay channel , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "this system was studied recently in a multichannel momentum - space model and also in a two - component coordinate - space model .",
    "the former @xcite demonstrated that an @xmath8 resonance pole with a realistic imaginary part ( see fig .",
    "[ x3872 ] ) can result from unquenching a bare @xmath27 @xmath28 state about 100 mev higher in mass via several two - meson channels , including the ozi - forbidden @xmath29 and @xmath30 channels , and accounting for the @xmath31 , @xmath32 widths . on the other hand",
    ", the latter paper @xcite showed that @xmath8 has a sizable @xmath28 component and thus can not be considered a @xmath26 molecule ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite and talk by m.  cardoso @xcite ) .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the charmed - strange and charmed - light mesons with @xmath9 reveal @xcite a very irregular pattern of masses and widths , impossible to understand with the ususal perturbative spin - orbit interactions and decay amplitudes , or heavy - quark effective theory .",
    "however , a multichannel    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     unquenched quark - model calculation with bare @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 or @xmath36 seeds does an excellent job in reproducing the data @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ axialcharm ] some pole trajectories are shown .",
    "meson spectroscopy is truly different from atomic spectroscopy , in that line widths can be of the same order as level spacings .",
    "analyticity then implies that real level shifts may be of similar or even greater magnitude .",
    "the proper , non - perturbative way to deal with this is by describing mesons as resonances or bound states in a scattering process of the dominant real or virtual decay products , yet while dealing with quark confinement at the same time and on an equal footing .",
    "the above examples from various sectors of the meson spectrum should provide support for such an approach .",
    "+ in conclusion , meson spectroscopy is even more involved because of natural , non - resonant threshold enhancements ( see talk by e.  van beveren @xcite ) .",
