    "neutrinos offer a unique opportunity to explore the universe in depth over a wide energy range  @xcite . however , since neutrino fluxes at high energy ( e@xmath1  tev ) are expected to be very low  @xcite , a very large detector volume is required .",
    "a detector immersed in the sea provides a cheap and efficient method of observing high energy muon neutrinos by detecting the muon produced from a charged current interaction in the matter surrounding the detector .",
    "the muon emits erenkov light as it passes through the water , and this light can be detected by a three - dimensional array of optical sensors called optical modules ( om ) .",
    "the measurement of the arrival time of the erenkov light at each om allows the reconstruction of the muon direction , and the amount of light collected can be used to estimate the muon energy .",
    "the antares collaboration has started the construction of a 0.1  km@xmath0  detector to be immersed at 2400  m depth in the mediterranean sea  40  km off the french coast ( 42@xmath2 50 n , 6@xmath2 10 e ) .",
    "this detector will be equipped with about 1000 oms and has been designed to be competitive with other such detectors ( dumand  @xcite , baikal  @xcite , amanda  @xcite and nestor  @xcite ) , notably in terms of angular resolution . to reach this goal ,",
    "extensive r&d studies have been carried out during the past years in order to optimize the design of each element of the telescope , particularly its most fundamental component , the optical module .",
    "this optimization work has involved a variety of measurements , both in the laboratory and _ in situ _ , as well as monte carlo simulations .",
    "this paper gives the results of these studies and describes in detail the final design of the antares optical module .",
    "in section  [ sec : omspecif ] , the constraints inherent to the operation of a deep sea neutrino detector are reviewed and the specifications for the optical modules are listed .",
    "section  [ sec : omassembly ] describes the main features of the different components of the om as well as the assembly procedure .",
    "the test set - ups and the main results of the tests performed by the collaboration during the past years are presented in section  [ sec : omtest ] . finally , section  [ sec : massprod ] deals with mass production and quality control aspects .",
    "the detection of high energy cosmic neutrinos together with the expected background sources impose particular constraints on the design of a deep undersea detector and on its basic element , the optical module .",
    "atmospheric muons , originating from mesons which are copiously produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the earth s atmosphere , are the dominant source of background for a neutrino telescope based on the detection of the muons produced in neutrino interactions .",
    "atmospheric muons are about 10 orders of magnitude more numerous at sea level than muons produced by neutrinos .",
    "shielding the telescope against atmospheric muons is thus one of the most important considerations of the telescope design .",
    "a straightforward way of reducing the down - going atmospheric muon flux is to immerse the telescope as deep as possible in the sea . at 2400  m ,",
    "the depth chosen for the antares detector , the atmospheric muon flux is already reduced by more than 4 orders of magnitude . though significant , this is still insufficient for the measurement of down - going neutrino interactions and a more radical method is to observe only up - going muons , using the earth itself as a natural shield . since the material of the earth stops all up - going atmospheric muons , the telescope is only sensitive to muons produced in neutrino interactions .",
    "important sources of background light come from natural radioactivity of sea water ( @xmath3k decays ) and from the presence of bioluminescent organisms .",
    "this optical background has both continuous and burst components which have been studied in detail at the antares site  @xcite .",
    "though it has no significant impact on the om design itself , it does constrain the trigger scheme as well as the data acquisition system .",
    "the expected signal fluxes are very low , so the surface area of the detector must be as large as possible , preferably or more .",
    "the 0.1  km@xmath0 telescope foreseen as the first phase of the antares project , despite its limited size , should provide some initial results on high energy neutrino sources .",
    "the antares detector , shown in figure [ fig : detecteur ] , consists of a three - dimensional array of optical modules supported by flexible vertical strings anchored to the sea bottom  @xcite .",
    "each om ( figure  [ fig : photoom ] ) contains a large area photosensor ( photomultiplier ) protected from the outside pressure .",
    "the detector is connected to the shore by an electro - optical cable for data transmission and power supply .",
    "these strings are about 400  m long and separated from each other by at least 60  m. each string is equipped with 90 oms , grouped together in triplets at 30 storeys ( figure [ fig : omf ] ) and connected to a local control module which holds the electronics for the trigger , signal digitization , slow - control and data transmission .",
    "the storeys on a given string are spaced 12  m vertically along an interconnecting elctro - opto - mechanical cable .",
    "oms at each storey are positioned with the axis of the photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) pointing outwards and inclined at 45@xmath4 below the horizontal .",
    "the strings must be flexible for deployment .",
    "deep sea currents may modify the shape of the strings , so an accurate positioning system is required to monitor their deformation during and after deployment and to measure the position of each element with a precision better than 20  cm .",
    "several additional instruments are needed to monitor the environmental conditions and to calibrate the detector in time and in energy .",
    "the scientific goals and the environmental constraints on the antares detector described in the previous sections lead to the following global requirements for the om :    * light detection must be optimized .",
    "a hemispherical photomultiplier with a large photocathode surface must be used . for maximum detection efficiency",
    ", special care must be taken to ensure the best possible optical coupling between the water and the photocathode , and the influence of the earth s magnetic field must be minimized . * due to the pressure at a depth of 2400  m , the photomultiplier and its associated electronics must be housed in a pressure - resistant glass sphere .",
    "the om must withstand conditions likely to occur during sea operations ( shocks , corrosion , vibrations , exposure to sunlight , etc . ) .",
    "* the om life - time should be greater than 10 years . due to the deep - sea environment",
    ", it will be difficult and expensive to repair the detector .",
    "therefore , the reliability of all components should be high .",
    "the layout of the om is shown in figure  [ fig : om_layout ] .",
    "its main component is a large area hemispherical photomultiplier ( pmt ) glued in a pressure resistant glass sphere with optical gel .",
    "a @xmath5-metal cage is used to shield the pmt against the earth s magnetic field .",
    "electronics inside the om are reduced to a minimum , namely : the pmt high voltage power supply and a led system used for internal calibration .",
    "the specifications for all the components are described in this section as well as the main technical solutions adopted .",
    "the reconstruction of the neutrino direction is based on the measurement of the arrival time of the erenkov light at each om .",
    "optimization studies based on computer simulations have shown that , to achieve the desired detector performance , the photomultiplier must have a large photocathode surface ( @xmath6  500  cm@xmath0 ) , timing resolution better than 3.0  ns ( fwhm ) , gain @xmath8 greater than 5@xmath910@xmath10 and good energy response : peak - to - valley ratio p / v @xmath62 and single photo - electron resolution @xmath11% .",
    "seven types of photomultipliers with various photocathode diameters from three different manufacturers have been evaluated : 8@xmath12 ( r5912 - 02 ) , 10@xmath12 ( r7081 - 20 ) and 13@xmath12 ( r8055 ) from hamamatsu , 9@xmath12 ( xp1802 ) and 10.6@xmath12 ( xp1804/d2 ) from photonis , 8@xmath12 ( etl9353 ) and 11@xmath12 ( d694 ) from electron tubes ltd .",
    "a figure of merit was evaluated for each of these products .",
    "the photomultiplier selected is the 14-stage 10@xmath12 hamamatsu photomultiplier r7081 - 20 ( figure  [ fig : pmt ] ) .",
    "its main characteristics are summarized in table  [ tab : pmt ] .",
    "details of the pmt measurements will be reported separately  @xcite .",
    ".average properties of the 10@xmath12 hamamatsu photomultiplier r7081 - 20 .",
    "the transit time spread ( tts ) , the peak - to - valley ratio ( p / v ) , and the resolution @xmath13 are measured from the single photo - electron spectrum .",
    "the dark count ( dc ) rate is measured at room temperature and at 0.25 photo - electron level .",
    "quoted values are for a nominal gain of 5@xmath14 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ tab : testenviron ]      since the beginning of the antares project , more than 30 oms have been built and used for deep - sea measurements for the site evaluation campaign .",
    "these oms have been immersed for periods ranging from a few hours to more than one year  @xcite without a single failure .",
    "this indicates that the om fabrication is under control and is adequate for the intended purpose .    in november 1999",
    ", a prototype line connected to the shore via an electro - optical cable was deployed 40  km of the coast of marseilles at a depth of 1200  m. this line was equipped with 8 oms very similar to the final om design .",
    "the oms were stored for nearly 2 years before immersion , part of the time outdoors with minimum protection .",
    "the line was operated for about 6 months and recovered in june 2000 .",
    "all 8 oms were tested after recovery and were found to work as expected .",
    "tests were also performed in situ to quantify the destructive effect of the implosion of one om in a storey at various depths .",
    "storeys equipped with three empty spheres , one of which had been artificially weakened , were used .",
    "the implosion pressure could be varied by grinding out a variable flat section on the outer surface , the tests showed that the damage depended on the depth , as expected . at 1900  m , the weakened sphere imploded without damaging the other two spheres or the mechanical structure of the storey .",
    "but at 2600  m , the implosion of the weakened sphere triggered the implosion of the two other spheres and significantly distorted the mechanical structure . at this depth , the amount of energy released by the implosion is estimated to be in excess of 10@xmath15 joules .",
    "nonetheless , even when the three spheres of a storey are destroyed ( the worst case ) , the integrity of the string itself is not affected .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the failure of a sphere is most likely to result from inappropriate handling during deployment and transportation , a risk that can be minimized by using special procedures at these stages .",
    "for mass production , each element of the om is supplied fully tested and characterized by the different suppliers .",
    "nevertheless , several measurements are foreseen at differents stages of the assembly chain to ensure the quality and reliability of the production .",
    "some systematic checks applied to all oms allow the condition and basic functioning of each element to be assessed in a quick and easy way :    * the inside pressure of the glass sphere is read from its internal manometer upon reception and should be less than 900 mbars before opening ; * the photomultiplier , which has already undergone a detailed acceptance check , is tested with its final base just before gluing simply by switching the hv on and recording the signal shape at nominal gain on a digital scope ; * the elasticity of the optical glue is measured 24 hours after polymerization and should be in a predefined range ( samples of each optical glue preparation are stored for future measurements ) ; * the photomultiplier signal shape is recorded again just after closure of the om and should be identical to the signal shape before gluing ; * the inside pressure of the om is measured again before storage and should be the same as that obtained after closing .",
    "if the om fails to pass one of these tests during assembly , it is simply left out of the production chain .",
    "more detailed checks are made by sampling only .",
    "they will be performed on about 5% of all oms , chosen randomly .",
    "they consist of :    * a measurement of the refractive index of the optical glue on samples of the preparation taken after polymerization ; * a high pressure test at 307 bars ; * a measurement of the om response to short light pulses in a dedicated black box .",
    "the optical module is a key component of the antares detector . in view of its importance",
    ", extensive r&d studies have been carried out by the collaboration to ensure that it would not only be optimized in terms of performance , but would also be robust enough to withstand sea - operation stresses and be highly reliable so as to guarantee proper operation during the entire lifetime of the detector .",
    "the general design and the choice of components have been finalized , so that mass production of the oms can begin .",
