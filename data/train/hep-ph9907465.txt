    "many new or improved measurements of the spin asymmetry @xmath0},\\ ] ] @xmath1 , in longitudinally polarized dis off various different targets @xmath2 have become available in the past two years : e142 , e143 , and smc have presented their final data sets @xcite , and new results from hermes , e154 , and e155 have been reported recently @xcite . since none of these measurements were included in our original nlo qcd analysis @xcite , it seems to be appropriate to reanalyse these data within the framework of @xcite .    in nlo the polarized structure function @xmath3 in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) reads ( suppressing all @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependence ) @xmath6\\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 are the spin - dependent wilson coefficients and the symbol @xmath8 denotes the usual convolution in @xmath4 space . from ( [ eq : g1 ] ) it is obvious that inclusive dis data @xcite can reveal only information on @xmath9 but neither on @xmath10 _ and _ @xmath11 nor on @xmath12 , which enters ( [ eq : g1 ] ) only as an @xmath13 correction .",
    "thus one can either stick to a comprehensive analysis of polarized dis @xcite or one has to impose certain _ assumptions _ about the flavor decomposition in order to be able to estimate processes other than dis for upcoming experiments like rhic .",
    "as in @xcite , and other more recent qcd analyses @xcite , we follow the latter option .",
    "due to the lack of space we shall be rather brief and concentrate only on the most important changes since @xcite .",
    "the limited amount of data demands a reasonably simple , but flexible enough ansatz for the polarized densities such as @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "note that in @xcite we actually used @xmath16 in ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) instead of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , however the positivity constraint @xmath19 which we want to exploit in our analysis , does not necessarily hold for the valence densities .",
    "of course , the bound ( [ eq : pos ] ) is strictly valid only in lo and is subject to nlo corrections @xcite because the @xmath20 become unphysical , scheme - dependent objects in nlo .",
    "however the corrections are not very pronounced , in particular at large @xmath4 @xcite , the only region where ( [ eq : pos ] ) imposes some restrictions in practice .",
    "we therefore use ( [ eq : pos ] ) also in nlo .    to further simplify ( [ eq : ansatz ] )",
    "we _ assume _ that @xmath21 , fix @xmath22 by the relations between the first moments of the non - singlet combinations @xmath23 and the @xmath24 and @xmath25 values ( using the updated value for @xmath26 @xcite ) , and take @xmath27 .",
    "in the latter relation we _ choose _ @xmath28 ( @xmath29 symmetric sea ) , but similarly agreeable fits are obtained , e.g. , for @xmath30 ( see also @xcite ) , as well as by using an independent @xmath4 shape for @xmath31 , reflecting the above mentioned uncertainty in the flavor separation .    for the unpolarized distributions @xmath32 in ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) and ( [ eq : pos ] )",
    "we use the updated grv densities @xcite and also adopt their values for the input scale @xmath33 ( @xmath34 in nlo ) and @xmath35 .",
    "note that in @xcite the rg equation for @xmath36 is now solved exactly instead of using the approximative nlo formula ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which is more appropriate at low @xmath5 where many of the polarized data lie .    to fix the remaining parameters in ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) we perform fits to the directly measured spin asymmetry ( [ eq : a1 ] ) in lo _ and _ nlo , which is mandatory if one wants to adopt these distributions in a consistent analysis of the perturbative stability of polarized processes .",
    "also most mc programs only contain lo matrix elements , and hence lo densities are more appropriate . apart from the above outlined ` standard scenario ' fit , equally good fits can be performed in a ` valence scenario ' ( see @xcite ) which is based on the assumption @xcite that the @xmath37 values fix only the valence parts of @xmath23 .",
    "the main feature of such a model is the possibility to describe the data with a vanishing strange sea . due to the lack of space we do not pursue this scenario here and restrict ourselves in what follows to the results obtained in the nlo @xmath38 ` standard scenario ' framework .",
    "a comparison of our new nlo fit with the available @xmath39 data @xcite and with our previous analysis @xcite is presented in fig .  1",
    ". the total @xmath40 values of the new and old fits are 147.4 and 183 , respectively , for 185 data points and adding statistical and systematical errors in quadrature .",
    "as can be seen , sizeable differences appear only in case of the neutron asymmetry , which leaves its footprint also in the individual parton densities @xmath20 shown in fig .  2 . since the neutron data mainly probe @xmath41 , the most prominent changes are observed here .",
    "the differences in the sea and in @xmath12 only reflect the fact that they are constrained to a much lesser extent by the data than @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in particular @xmath12 remains to be hardly constrained at all , which is not surprising due to the lack of any direct information on @xmath12 so far .",
    "therefore we show in fig .  2 also the results of two other fits , which are based on additional constraints on @xmath12 .",
    "for the ` @xmath42 ' fit we start from a vanishing gluon input in ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , and the ` static @xmath12 ' is chosen in such a way that its first moment becomes independent of @xmath5 .",
    "this can be achieved by setting @xmath43 and yields in lo @xmath44 ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath45 is the total helicity carried by quarks ( the relation is only subject to a small nlo correction ) .",
    "both gluons give also excellent fits to the available data and do not affect the results for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "in fact we can obtain fits without any significant change in @xmath40 for @xmath46 in the range -0.3  0.6 ( our best fit has 0.28 , corresponding to @xmath47 ) . the uncertainty in @xmath12",
    "is compatible to the one found in @xcite , although our gluons extend also to slightly negative first moments .",
    "it is interesting to observe that for our best fit gluon the spin of the nucleon @xmath48 is dominantly carried by quarks and gluons at our input scale @xmath33 , and only during the @xmath5 evolution a large negative @xmath49 is being built up in order to compensate for the strong rise of @xmath50 , see fig .  5 in @xcite .",
    "for the ` static @xmath12 ' the situation is completely different : by construction the quark and gluon contributions to ( [ eq : spinsum ] ) cancel each other implying that for _ all _ values of @xmath5 the spin is entirely of angular momentum origin , contrary to what is intuitively expected .",
    "inevitably the large uncertainty in @xmath12 implies that the small @xmath4 behaviour of @xmath3 is completely uncertain and not predictable ( see fig .  3 in @xcite ) , which translates also into a large theoretical error from the @xmath51 extrapolation when calculating first moments of @xmath3 .",
    "taking our best fit we obtain @xmath52 and @xmath53 at @xmath54 in agreement with a recent smc qcd analysis @xcite .",
    "the two challenging questions concerning polarized parton densities are still @xmath12 and the flavor decomposition .",
    "recent semi - inclusive dis results @xcite may help to unravel the latter , but major progress , in particular on @xmath12 , can be only expected from rhic .",
    "a realization of the optional upgrade of hera to a polarized collider would be also very helpful to gain more insight into the spin structure of the nucleon _ and _ the photon , with the latter being completely unmeasured so far .",
