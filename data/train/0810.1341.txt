    "advection - dominated accretion flows ( hereafter adafs ) have been studied extensively ( e.g , narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; see narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 and kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 for reviews ) .",
    "it is now rather well established that this accretion mode exists in the quiescent and hard states of black hole x - ray binaries and low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( see narayan 2005 , yuan 2007 , ho 2008 , and narayan & mcclintock 2008 for recent reviews ) .",
    "adafs only exist below a critical mass accretion rate . below this accretion rate ,",
    "the rate of radiative cooling is so weak that the viscous heating is balanced by the advection . with the increase of accretion rate ,",
    "radiation becomes more and more important until it becomes equal to the viscous heating at this critical rate .",
    "in this case , the energy advection is equal to zero ( narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ) . above this critical accretion rate ,",
    "up to another limit close to the eddington accretion rate , another hot accretion solution  luminous hot accretion flows ( lhafs)was found which is a natural extension of adafs ( yuan 2001 , 2003 ) . in this solution ,",
    "the flow is able to remain hot because the radiative cooling rate , although it is strong , is still lower than the sum of compression work and viscous heating .",
    "note that the cool thin solution  standard thin disk  always exists in the whole range of accretion rates of adafs and lhafs . in the present work we only focus on the hot accretion flows  adafs , but",
    "our discussion should hold for lhafs . in the early version of adafs",
    ", the accretion rate is assumed to be a constant , i.e. , there is no outflow throughout the region .",
    "the magnetic field is included , but only its stochastic component , while the large - scale ordered field is not considered .",
    "great developments have been achieved since the discovery of adafs .",
    "one is the realization of the existence of outflows in adafs , i.e , only some fraction of the accretion material available at the outer boundary is actually accreted into the central black hole ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; stone , begelman , pringle 1999 ; igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 ; stone & pringle 2001 ) .",
    "the physical reason for the origin of the outflow is believed to be that the bernoulli parameter of the flow is positive ( narayan & yi 1994 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "another possible mechanism of the outflow origin is associated with large - scale ordered magnetic fields , e.g. , through the magnetocentrifugal force ( blandford & payne 1982 ; henriksen & valls - gabaud 1994 ; fiege & henriksen 1996 ) .",
    "observations in the center of our galaxy supply strong evidence for the existence of outflows . from @xmath0 observations combined with bondi accretion theory",
    ", we can predict the accretion rate at the bondi radius .",
    "polarization observations at radio wavebands , however , indicate that the accretion rate at the innermost region must be significantly smaller than the bondi value ( yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , a large amount of material must be lost into outflows .",
    "another interesting result of numerical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the hot accretion flow is that a large - scale ordered magnetic field exists in the inner regions of adafs .",
    "independent of the initial configuration of the magnetic field * ( toroidal or poloidal ) * in the main body of the accretion flow the field is primarily toroidal , with weak radial and vertical components .",
    "this large - scale structure is imposed on the stochastic component of the magnetic field on small scales ( machida , hayashi & matsumoto 2000 ; hirose et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "both outflows and large - scale magnetic fields can affect the dynamics of adafs significantly .",
    "for example , both of them can effectively transfer angular momentum .",
    "these are alternative mechanisms in addition to the turbulence mechanism associated with the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) proposed by balbus & hawley ( 1991 ; 1998 ) .",
    "stone & norman ( 1994 ; see also mouschovias & paleologou 1980 ) investigate the angular momentum transfer by magnetic braking effects associated with a large - scale magnetic field . if the specific internal energy of the outflow is different from that of the inflow where the outflow originates , the outflow acts as an extra cooling or heating term in the accretion flow , as discussed phenomenologically by blandford & begelman ( 1999 ) .",
    "xie & yuan ( 2008 ) parameterize the outflow properties and systematically investigate the effects of the outflow on the dynamics of the inflow , in absence of the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "it is thus necessary to investigate the dynamics of adafs with coexistent outflows and large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "several works have been done recently under the self - similar approximation ( akizuki & fukue 2006 ; abbassi , ghanbari & najjar 2008 ; zhang & dai 2008 ) or global solution ( oda et al .",
    "all these works consider the dynamical effects of the outflow by adopting the form @xmath1 ( e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ mdot ] ) ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) to describe the accretion rate while all other effects such as the probable angular momentum transfer by outflows are neglected . in akizuki & fukue ( 2006 ) ,",
    "oda et al . ( 2007 ) , and abbassi , ghanbari & najjar ( 2008 ) , only the toroidal component of the large - scale magnetic field is considered ; thus , the large - scale magnetic field in their model only supplies an additional force in the radial direction , while it is unable to transfer angular momentum . in zhang & dai ( 2008 ) , although all the three components of the large - scale magnetic field are included explicitly , their solutions unfortunately violate the magnetic divergence - free condition when @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the self - similar solutions of adafs with coexistent outflows and large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "we assume the large - scale magnetic field has both @xmath3 and @xmath4 components , hence , the large - scale magnetic field does not only affect the radial force balance of the accretion flow , but also helps to remove angular momentum . following xie & yuan ( 2008 ) ,",
    "we take into account the dynamical effects of outflows by considering the differences of specific angular momentum and specific internal energy between inflow and outflow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in @xmath5",
    "we present the basic mhd equations , which include ordered magnetic fields and outflows .",
    "we address in @xmath6 further assumptions , and achieve a set of self - similar equations .",
    "numerical results are presented in @xmath7 .",
    "we summarize the paper in @xmath8 .",
    "in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath9 ) , we investigate the steady - state , axisymmetric ( @xmath10 ) magnetized advection - dominated accretion flows with outflows .",
    "the general mhd equations in gaussian units read ( e.g. , lovelace , romanova , & newman 1994 ) , @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 the induction equation of the magnetic field reads , @xmath15 the final equation is the energy equation , @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the gravitational potential ; @xmath18 is the viscous force per unit volume ; @xmath19 is the magnetic field ; @xmath20 is the magnetic diffusivity ; @xmath21 is the current density ; @xmath22 is the specific internal energy of the accretion flow ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the viscous heating and radiative cooling rates ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 have their usual meanings . for simplicity",
    ", we use the newtonian potential and neglect the self - gravity of the accreting gas .",
    "the advection factor , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , describes the fraction of the viscous dissipation energy which is stored in the accretion flow and advected into the central black hole rather than radiated away .    from the numerical mhd simulations ( e.g. , machida , hayashi & matsumoto 2000 ;",
    "hirose et al .",
    "2004 ) , it is reasonable to decompose the magnetic field into one large - scale component and one fluctuating or turbulent component .",
    "the general picture that emerged from the simulations is that the main body of the accretion flow is governed by a toroidal magnetic field , especially in its inner region , while regions near the poles are primarily governed by a poloidal magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "6 in hirose et al . 2004 ) , which is mainly in the vertical direction .",
    "thus , we only consider the @xmath4 and @xmath3 components ( @xmath30 ) of the large - scale magnetic field and neglect the radial component ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we describe the effects of the fluctuating component of the magnetic field in transferring the angular momentum and in dissipating the energy through the usual @xmath32 description . specifically , the viscous heating rate @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is associated with the turbulent component instead of the large - scale ordered component of the magnetic field .",
    "this is because numerical simulations show that the dissipation mainly comes from the thermalization of the magnetic energy via magnetic reconnection ( hirose et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is obviously associated with the turbulent component .",
    "following lovelace , romanova & newman ( 1994 ) , we assume @xmath33 is an even function of @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the vertical gradient of @xmath33 in the disc .",
    "we take @xmath34 to be an odd function of @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore have , @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the half - height of the accretion disc defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath41 is the keplerian velocity and @xmath42 is defined below in eq . (",
    ". it will reduce to its traditional form of @xmath43 in absence of the toroidal component ( @xmath34 ) of the ordered magnetic field ( eq . ( [ zmon2 ] ) ) . under the above assumptions , the divergence - free condition of the magnetic field ( eq .",
    "( [ diver ] ) ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "the specific angular momentum and specific internal energy of the outflow are in general different from those of the inflow where the outflow originates .",
    "a two - dimensional calculation is ideal but complicated and out of the scope of our current work .",
    "instead , we follow the method illustrated in xie & yuan ( 2008 ) and use several parameters ( @xmath44 ; see below for definitions ) to characterize the properties of the outflow . in this way",
    ", we integrate the above mhd equations in the vertical direction and get the following 1.5-dimensional equations to describe the inflow dynamics ( xie & yuan 2008 ) .",
    "the equations of the conservation of mass and momentum are , @xmath45 @xmath46,\\label{rmon2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath47 the static equilibrium in the vertical direction is achieved between the @xmath3-component of the gravitational force and the ( gas and magnetic ) pressure gradient force , @xmath48 the tension term associated with @xmath33 is @xmath49 .",
    "it is neglected since we have assumed @xmath50 .",
    "the energy equation is @xmath51 here @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the @xmath55 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 components of the velocity of the outflow when it is just launched from the accretion flow ( xie & yuan 2008 ) , and @xmath56 and @xmath22 correspond to the specific internal energy of the outflow and that of the inflow , respectively . following xie & yuan ( 2008 ) , we assume @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "parameter @xmath59 is the ratio of the specific heats , which goes from the relativistic value @xmath60 to the typical monatomic gas value @xmath61 . in our calculations we set @xmath62 .",
    "we find our results are not sensitive to the value of @xmath59 .",
    "the second terms on the left - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ rmon2 ] ) & ( [ phimon2 ] ) are the momenta ( radial and angular ) taken away from or deposited into the inflow by the outflow ( xie & yuan 2008 ) , and the third term on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ energy2 ] ) is the internal energy taken away from or deposited into the inflow by the outflow .",
    "if all these @xmath63s are equal to unity , our model will reduce to those neglecting the discrepancies of specific momenta and internal energy between the inflow and the outflow ( e.g. , akizuki & fukue 2006 ; abbassi , ghanbari & najjar 2008 ; zhang & dai 2008 ) .",
    "now we discuss the induction equation ( eq .",
    "( [ induc ] ) ) .",
    "this equation describes the growth or escape rate of the magnetic field by dynamo and diffusion .",
    "we define the advection rates of the two components of the magnetic flux as , @xmath64 @xmath65 for a steady - state accretion system considered here , if the dynamo and the diffusion effects are neglected , the above two quantities will be constant .",
    "however , in a realistic accretion disc , the above two quantities can vary with radius due to the presence of the dynamo and the diffusion effects .",
    "we seek self - similar solutions in the following forms ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1995 ) , @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 we assume the surface density ( @xmath69 ) to have the form , @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are two constants , so the accretion rate takes the form , @xmath73 note that @xmath74 will lead to solutions without outflows .",
    "we assume the magnetic pressure on the surface of the accretion flow to be proportional to the gas pressure in the following way , @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath42 and @xmath77 are two parameters .",
    "the induction equations will be satisfied if the dynamo and the diffusion of the magnetic field satisfy the self - similar conditions required by the advection rate ( eqs .",
    "( [ induc1 ] ) & ( [ induc2 ] ) ) .",
    "typical values of @xmath42 and @xmath77 lie in the range @xmath78 in hot accretion flows ( e.g. , de villiers , hawley & krolik 2003 ; beckwith et al .",
    "2008 ) , but here we also consider the magnetically - dominated case ( @xmath79 ) . on one hand , the mhd numerical simulation by machida , nakamura & matsumoto ( 2006 ) shows that when thermal instability happens in an adaf , the thermal pressure rapidly decreases while the magnetic pressure increases due to the conservation of magnetic flux",
    ". this will result in large @xmath42 and @xmath77 and forms a magnetically - dominated accretion flow .",
    "in addition , an initially weak large - scale field at the outer region can be amplified due to the compression of the flow as it is accreted inward .",
    "this can also result in large @xmath42 and @xmath77 .",
    "of course , in this case , the mri will be suppressed , but we still keep @xmath32 in equations for simplicity and this treatment will not affect our results significantly for our purpose",
    ".      +      the momentum conservation and the vertical equilibrium equations ( eqs .",
    "( [ rmon2 ]  [ zmon2 ] ) ) now reduce to , @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 the energy equation becomes , @xmath83 = \\frac{9}{4}f c_2 ^ 2.\\label{energy3}\\ ] ] obviously for given values of @xmath84 and @xmath77 , eqs .",
    "( [ rmon3 ] ) , ( [ phimon3 ] ) and ( [ energy3 ] ) form a closed set of equations of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which will determine the dynamics of the accretion flow .",
    "+      the first and the second terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ phimon3 ] ) are angular momentum transfer due to turbulent - viscosity ( mri ) and the large - scale magnetic field , respectively .",
    "we define a new parameter @xmath87 to account for the ratio of angular momentum transport due to these two mechanisms , @xmath88 the large - scale magnetic field will be the dominant mechanism in angular momentum transport when @xmath87 is below unity .",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the effects of the large - scale magnetic field on the accretion flow .",
    "we set @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( no outflows ) .",
    "the solid , dotted and long - dashed lines correspond to @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "we can see from the figure that as @xmath34 ( @xmath42 ) increases , the radial ( @xmath93 ) and angular ( @xmath94 ) velocities increase , while the temperature ( @xmath86 ) and the turbulent - viscosity contribution to angular momentum transport ( @xmath87 ) decrease .",
    "the decrease of @xmath87 is obvious and easy to understand , since the large - scale magnetic field should be more important in transporting angular momentum as its strength increases .",
    "we find that the magnetic pressure gradient force ( the fourth and fifth terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rmon3 ] ) ) is a centrifugal force , while the magnetic stress force ( the sixth term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rmon3 ] ) ) is a centripetal force . for the wide range of @xmath42 and @xmath77 considered here , the gradient of the total pressure ( gas plus magnetic pressure ) serves as a centrifugal force , and it exceeds the magnetic centripetal force .",
    "all these terms are proportional to the sound speed ( or , equivalently , the temperature @xmath86 ) . the solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ rmon3])-([energy3 ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , indicate that an increase in @xmath34 ( @xmath42 ) results in a decrease in temperature ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this in turn leads to a decrease of the effective centrifugal force , and subsequently an increase of the infalling velocity @xmath95 , as shown in the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . combined with the energy equation ( eq .",
    "( [ energy3 ] ) ) , the angular velocity will increase correspondingly .",
    "the change of the @xmath3 component of the ordered magnetic field has similar effects .",
    "it is evident from figure [ f1 ] that an increase in the @xmath3 component of the magnetic field @xmath33 ( @xmath77 ) will lead to a decrease in temperature ( @xmath86 ) . due to the decrease of temperature , the effective centrifugal force decreases , so the infalling velocity increases . from the energy equation ( eq .",
    "( [ energy3 ] ) ) , the angular velocity will increase correspondingly .",
    "we thus come to a general conclusion that , the stronger the magnetic field is , the faster the accretion flow rotates and falls into the central object , and the lower the temperature will be ( see figs .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) & ( [ f3 ] ) for situations with outflows ) .",
    "the decrease of temperature of adafs after taking into account the large - scale magnetic field may have an important observational implication .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the hard state of black hole x - ray binaries and some agns ( such as type 1 seyfert galaxies ) are well described by a power - law form with a high - energy cutoff .",
    "this kind of spectrum is widely accepted as originating from the thermal comptonization process in a hot plasma which is likely to be the region of a hot accretion flow where most of the radiation originates ( see review by zdziarski & gierliski 2004 ) .",
    "the value of the cutoff energy is determined by the temperature of the accretion flow , while the slope of the power - law distribution is determined by the product of temperature and optical depth . from fitting the observed x - ray spectrum",
    ", we can well constrain these two parameters , namely the optical depth and temperature . on the other hand",
    ", we can also calculate their values from the hot accretion flow model .",
    "yuan & zdziarski ( 2004 ) find that while the theoretical prediction is roughly consistent with observational results , for some sources the temperature obtained from observation , @xmath96 kev , is significantly lower than that the lowest value predicted by the hot accretion flow models , @xmath97 kev ( see fig . 1 in yuan & zdziarski 2004 ) .",
    "our current work indicates that this discrepancy may be solved by including the large - scale magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) and the outflow ( figs .",
    "[ f2]&[f3 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to give a quantitative estimation of how strong the magnetic field is required to be to solve the discrepancy .",
    "this is because our current work is based on the self - similar assumption which does not hold in the innermost transonic region of the accretion flow where most of the radiation originates .    before examining in detail the effects of the outflow on the dynamics of the inflow",
    ", we first check the effects of the discrepancy of the radial velocity between the outflow and the inflow ( indicated by @xmath98 ) .",
    "consistent with xie & yuan ( 2008 ) , we find that for relatively weak outflows ( e.g. , @xmath99 ) and reasonable values of @xmath98 , the effects are of minor importance .",
    "thus for the discussions below , we set @xmath100 .",
    "+      we present in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the effects of angular momentum discrepancy between the inflow and the outflow .",
    "we set @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "parameter @xmath103 means @xmath104 , which corresponds to a relatively strong outflow ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "the dotted , solid and long - dashed lines correspond to @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "parameter @xmath107 means that the outflow helps to remove angular momentum from the inflow .",
    "the accretion flow has distinctive properties between @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "when @xmath42 is below unity , the effects of the large - scale magnetic field can be neglected . as @xmath110 increases from @xmath111 to @xmath106",
    ", we can see from fig .",
    "[ f2 ] that the radial and angular velocities increase while the temperature decreases .",
    "we can understand these results in the following way . from eq .",
    "( [ energy3 ] ) , we see that @xmath93 and @xmath94 will increase or decrease together ( note the magnetic terms are negligible ) .",
    "if both of them would decrease , from eq .",
    "( 24 ) we know that @xmath86 must increase ; while this is in conflict with what eq .",
    "( 25 ) implies if @xmath110 increases .",
    "thus both @xmath93 and @xmath94 , i.e. , the radial and angular velocities , must increase when @xmath110 increases , and the temperature decreases .",
    "physically , the increase of the radial velocity is explained by the decrease in the gas pressure gradient force with the decreasing temperature .",
    "we note that these self - similar results are consistent with the global solutions of xie & yuan ( 2008 ) .",
    "we can understand the results for @xmath109 in a similar way , except that in this case the magnetic force ( magnetic pressure and stress forces ) exceeds the gas pressure gradient force .",
    "the critical value of @xmath42 corresponds to the balance between the forces of gas pressure and magnetic pressure , and the value is related to the strength of the outflow . for cases considered here ( @xmath112 ) , this critical value is @xmath113 .    from the upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , we see that the accretion flow will be super - keplerian when the toroidal magnetic field is very strong ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) . this is because the strong magnetic stress force serves as a centripetal force .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the case when the specific internal energy of the outflow is different from that of the inflow .",
    "we take parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 , as before . unlike the case shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , here we set @xmath116 .",
    "the dotted , solid and long - dashed lines correspond to @xmath117 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "the outflow then plays an extra cooling role for the inflow if its specific internal energy is higher than that of the inflow ( @xmath118 ) , or a heating role otherwise .",
    "we can see from the figure that for the case of a weak magnetic field ( @xmath119 ) , when @xmath120 increases from @xmath111 to @xmath106 , the temperature ( @xmath86 ) and radial velocity of the inflow decrease while the angular velocity increases .",
    "the reason is as follows . from eq .",
    "( [ phimon3 ] ) we know @xmath93 and @xmath86 must increase or decrease together . if both would increase with increasing @xmath120 , from eq .",
    "( [ rmon3 ] ) we know that @xmath94 must decrease , which is in conflict with eq .",
    "( [ energy3 ] ) .",
    "the results of a strong magnetic field ( @xmath121 ) can be understood in a similar way .    unlike the case without outflows ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , we find from figs .",
    "[ f2 ] & [ f3 ] that , when the toroidal component of the large - scale magnetic field is strong ( e.g. , @xmath122 ) , the accretion flow is super - keplerian .",
    "this is because , for the cases of strong outflows ( @xmath123 ) considered in figs .",
    "[ f2 ] & [ f3 ] , the `` centrifugal force '' ( gradient of the gas plus magnetic pressure ) is much weaker than in the case without outflows ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) ; while the `` centripetal force '' ( magnetic stress force ) does not vary too much .",
    "finally , we note that in the limits of @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , i.e. , the accretion flow is radiatively efficient , and is devoid of outflows and magnetic fields , our equations will lead to the solution with @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which corresponds to a standard thin disc , as expected .",
    "numerical mhd simulations show that both large - scale ordered magnetic fields and outflows exist in the inner regions of an adaf . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated their influences on the dynamics of the accretion flow in a self - similar approach .",
    "we assume that in addition to the stochastic component , the magnetic field has a strong large - scale ordered component .",
    "the magnetic pressure and stress forces associated with the large - scale field thus will affect the dynamics of the accretion flow .",
    "we adopt the conventional @xmath32 description to mimic the angular momentum and heating effects associated with the tangled magnetic field .",
    "we find that when the large - scale magnetic field gets stronger , the radial and angular velocities of the accretion flow increase , while the temperature decreases . the large - scale field will be more important than the turbulent - viscosity in transferring angular momentum even when the field is moderately strong ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) .",
    "we have obtained the self - similar solutions with both large - scale magnetic fields and outflows . the outflow does not only change the radial profile of the mass accretion rate , but is also able to take away angular momentum and energy from the inflow .",
    "we parameterize the physical properties of the outflow , namely its radial velocity , specific angular momentum and specific internal energy .",
    "we find that when the specific angular momentum of the outflow increases , the temperature of the inflow decreases , while the radial and angular velocities increase ( decrease ) when the magnetic field is weak ( strong ) ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . when the specific internal energy of the outflow increases , the temperature and radial velocity of the inflow decrease , while the angular velocity increases ( decreases ) when the large - scale magnetic field is weak ( strong ) ( fig . [ f3 ] ) . when both outflows and large - scale magnetic fields are present , we find that the inflow could be super - keplerian if the field is very strong .",
    "the decrease in temperature of the inflow in presence of large - scale magnetic fields and/or outflows could explain a puzzle that the predicted temperature of hot accretion flows is higher than that obtained from fitting the observational data .",

    "<S> observations and numerical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations indicate the existence of outflows and ordered large - scale magnetic fields in the inner region of hot accretion flows . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the self - similar solutions for advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) with outflows and ordered magnetic fields . stimulated by numerical simulations , we assume that the magnetic field has a strong toroidal component and a vertical component in addition to a stochastic component . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the self - similar solutions to the equations describing the magnetized adafs , taking into account the dynamical effects of the outflow . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results with the canonical adafs and find that the dynamical properties of adafs such as radial velocity , angular velocity and temperature can be significantly changed in the presence of ordered magnetic fields and outflows . </S>",
    "<S> the stronger the magnetic field is , the lower the temperature of the accretion flow will be , and the faster the flow rotates . </S>",
