    "the entanglement entropy , being a measure of the correlations between two subsystems , depends on the geometry of the separating surface , becoming for this reason a quantity with a strong geometric character .",
    "this has inspired a holographic interpretation within the ads - cft correspondence framework @xcite , which provides a purely geometric way of calculating the entropy of conformal field theories .",
    "there are several results in the literature where the geometrical properties for different sets , dimensions and theories are explored both , from the quantum field theory and holographic approaches . among these , the coefficient @xmath1 of the logarithmically divergent term in the entanglement entropy @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ultraviolet cut - off , for general conformal field theories in four dimensions has been found to be proportional to the type @xmath4 and @xmath0 conformal anomaly coefficients @xcite    @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the euler number of the surface , @xmath7 is the second fundamental form , @xmath8 with @xmath9 are a pair of unit vectors orthogonal to @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the induced metric on the surface . from ( [ general ] ) , it can be seen that the sphere and the cylinder are sensitive only to one type of anomaly coefficient , @xmath4 or @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "this is @xcite @xmath12 for the sphere , while for a cylinder of length @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 it is @xmath15 for spherical sets , this result was later recalculated , numerically and analytically @xcite , using different technics , and recently extended to any theory @xcite . instead , the validity of the result ( [ coefs ] ) for the cylinder is more subtle .",
    "it has been also studied from the holographic point of view in @xcite where @xmath1 is found to be proportional to the @xmath0 conformal anomaly in four dimensions as in ( [ coefs ] ) , but it can not be generalized to higher dimensions where other conformally invariant terms can be added to ( [ general ] ) .    in this paper , we study numerically the logarithmic contributions to the entropy for a cylinder in @xmath16 dimensions for free massless scalar and dirac fields .",
    "the method we use consists first , in dimensionally reducing the problem of the three dimensional cylinder to the one of an infinite set of massive fields living in a two dimensional spatial disk .",
    "the entanglement entropy is then calculated numerically by the real time approach @xcite where the reduced density matrix is written in terms of free correlators .",
    "this is based , on one hand , on the method developed by sredniki for calculating the entropy for scalars in spherical sets @xcite where the field is discretized in the radial direction in polar coordinates , and on the other , on the work by peschel , whereby the reduced density matrix can be written in terms of correlators for both , bosonic and fermionic , solvable lattice systems @xcite .",
    "thus , for the numerical evaluation of the entropy of a dirac field in the disk , we extend the method described in @xcite , originally applicable only to scalar fields .",
    "then , from the expansion of the entropy in powers of @xmath17 valid in the large @xmath18 limit , we find the coefficient @xmath1 for the cylinder ( [ coefs ] ) .",
    "this is directly related to the coefficient of the term @xmath19 . in the same expansion",
    ", we also identify the coefficient of the linear term @xmath18 .",
    "this last , has been recently calculated analytically in @xcite , where the same type of expansion is considered for general smooth geometries and massive scalar theories . from the holographic point of view",
    ", new contributions to the entanglement entropy were also found when considering theories deformed by a relevant operator @xcite , consistently to that reported in @xcite .",
    "we find , for the cylinder , within a porcentual error @xmath20 for scalars and @xmath21 for dirac fields , @xmath22 and for the disk , within a porcentual error @xmath23 , @xmath24 in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "coming from the same expansion , each coefficient is cross checked by the other testing both at the same time",
    ". this concordance sums support to the general validity of the method used in @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail , later in the discussion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the second section , we discuss the dimensional reduction procedure and show the problem of massless fields in the cylinder can be reduced to the one of massive fields in a disk . in the third section , we discuss the approach we use for the numerical evaluation of the entanglement entropy in the disk , for both , scalar and dirac massive fields . in section 4",
    "we present our results and finally , its interpretation in the discussion .",
    "for free fields , some universal terms in the entanglement entropy in high dimensions can be obtained via dimensional reduction technics from results calculated in lower dimensions @xcite .",
    "let us consider a set in three spatial dimensions of the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a line on the first coordinate @xmath27 , of length @xmath13 , and @xmath28 is a sphere in two dimensions ( disk ) .",
    "we are interested in the entropy of @xmath29 in the limit of large @xmath13 .",
    "the direction @xmath27 can be compactified by imposing periodic boundary conditions @xmath30 , without changing the result of the leading extensive term . for a free massless field",
    "we fourier decompose it into the corresponding field modes in the compact direction @xmath31    the problem then reduces to a two dimensional one with an infinite tower of massive fields .",
    "for example , for a free scalar we obtain the tower of fields @xmath32 , @xmath33 from the point of view of the non compact @xmath34 directions , these fields have masses given by @xmath35 summing over the contributions of all the decoupled @xmath36 dimensional fields we have @xmath37 in the limit of large @xmath13 we can convert this sum into integral @xmath38 the universal terms in @xmath39 will then come from the ones of @xmath40 after integrating over the mass . for a dirac field , the spin multiplicity factor @xmath41}$ ]",
    "has to be incorporated . in the present case ,",
    "it is    @xmath42    expanding the entanglement entropy @xmath43 in powers of @xmath18 for large @xmath18 @xmath44 and inserting ( [ expansion ] ) in ( [ ala ] ) and ( [ ala1 ] ) for scalar and dirac fields respectively , we obtain for the @xmath16 dimensional theory that the logarithmic coefficient @xmath1 in @xmath39 is directly related to @xmath45 by @xmath46 on the other hand , for the dimensionally reduced theory , the contribution in the entropy proportional to the mass is given by the term proportional to the coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "this contribution was calculated in @xcite for massive scalar fields in any dimension for a waveguide geometry with specified boundary conditions using heat kernel methods .",

    "the general grounds the result for the cylinder is based on , rely first on the application of the replication method , then on demanding conformal invariance of the logarithmic contribution in the entropy derived from the effective action of the replicated manifold , and finally on calibrating a free parameter by using the holographic correspondence @xcite .",
    "the replica trick is a standard approach to calculate the entanglement entropy @xcite . in this construction",
    ", the trace of the integers powers of the reduced density matrix corresponds to the partition function of @xmath64 copies of the system connected consistently through the cuts along the boundary .",

    "taking into account this is not possible in general , then , the identification of the logarithmic coefficient with linear combinations of the stress tensor anomalies is not fully justified @xcite . in the case of spherical sets ,",
    "the objections to the applicability of the replication method disappear since there is an extra rotational symmetry in the transverse space about the entangling surface .",
    "in fact , the result for the sphere in four dimensions can be extended to any dimensions and any field theory @xcite .",
    "these results complete a solid proof for the term proportional to the type @xmath4 anomaly in ( [ general ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the cylinder , the situation is more obscure .",
    "very recently , it was found in @xcite for holographic models , that in four dimensions the logarithmic coefficient is proportional to the anomaly as expected , but that the same is not true for higher dimensions , where new conformally invariant terms could be added to ( [ general ] ) . in this scenario ,",
