    "we observed three transits of tres-1 on ut 2007",
    "september 12 , 15 , and 18 , corresponding to epochs @xmath0 , 153 , and 154 of the ephemeris given by ( * ? ? ? * winn  ( 2007 ) ) : @xmath1    and one transit of wasp-2 on ut 2007 september 13 , corresponding to epoch @xmath2 of the ephemeris given by ( * ? ? ? * charbonneau ( 2007 ) ) : @xmath3    we used ag2 , a frame - transfer ccd mounted at the folded cassegrain focus of the william herschel telescope of the isaac newton group , la palma , spain .",
    "ag2 is an ing - designed autoguider head with e2v ccd having a field of view ( fov ) @xmath4 and a pixel scale of @xmath5 .",
    "we used a kitt peak r filter in order to minimize the effect of color - dependent atmospheric extinction on the differential photometry and the effect of limb - darkening on the transit light curve .",
    "we observed under nearly perfect conditions on the nights of ut",
    "september 12 , 13 , and 18 . on the night of ut",
    "september 15 , we observed under scattered clouds in the second half of the night . on all nights , autoguiding ensured the positions of all stars on the ccd varied by no more than 3 pixels over the course of each night .",
    "we strongly defocused the telescope in order to minimize the effect of the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations , and also to enhance the duty cycle .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of stellar images was 7 pixels for wasp-2 and ranged from 8 to 13 pixels for tres-1 .",
    "for tres-1 for the three nights , we acquired 5 , 10 and 10 second exposures , while for wasp-2 we used 7 second exposures .",
    "we used standard iraf procedures for the overscan correction , bias subtraction and performing the differential photometry .",
    "we did not use flat - fields to minimise the impact of position - angle dependent scattered light entering the aperture .",
    "different aperture sizes were tried in order to find out the one that produced the minimum noise in the out - of - transit data . for tres-1 for the three nights ,",
    "the optimum aperture radii were 31 , 31 , and 34 pixels , while for wasp-2 it was 30 pixels .",
    "the sky background was subtracted , using an estimate of its brightness determined within an annulus centered on each star .",
    "because of the strong defocusing and other field stars , we set an inner radius of the annulus equal to the aperture radius and used the width of 10 pixels .",
    "the comparison stars used were 2mass : j19041058 + 3638409 , j19040934 + 3639195 , and j19040792 + 3640116 for tres-1 , and 2mass : j20304846 + 0627355 , and j20305168 + 0628008 for wasp-2 .",
    "for each night , differential photometry was obtained by taking the ratio of the signal of the variable to the mean of the comparisons , both normalized by a smooth function of time .    to estimate appropriate error bars for our data",

    "we rescaled the error bars to satisfy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of the measurements in each light curve .",
    "for the three nights of tres-1 we found that the true errors are higher by factors of 2.2 , 1.6 and 1.9 respectively than the errors including only the poisson noise , and for the one night of wasp-2 by a factor of 2.2 .",
