    "nanomagnetism has become an important area for both basic and applied research in the last years .",
    "such an importance is greatly due to recent advances in the synthesis and characterization of magnetic samples of very small sizes , comprising micro and sub - micrometer scales .",
    "nanomagnets of several shapes and sizes have appeared and have been intensively investigated , namely for potential applications in logic memory , data storage and highly sensitive sensors @xcite .",
    "such an interest has been renewed and reinforced by virtue of a very recent proposal of using biofunctionalized magnetic - vortex microdiscs for triggering cancer therapy @xcite .",
    "often , such applications are based upon new magneto - electronic mechanisms which preclude on demand control of the magnetization stable configurations , like single - domains , domain - walls , vortices , etc . among other",
    ", cylindrical and rectangular - type shape samples appear to be the most studied ones , once their relatively simple geometries make easier the fabrication and eventually the comparison between experimental and theoretical findings .",
    "for instance , in a thin enough sub - micron sized disc of soft material , like co or permalloy ( feni ) , the remanent ( at zero applied field ) ground - state is observed to be a single - vortex of rotating dipoles with a central core where they revolve against the disc plane for regularizing exchange cost @xcite . as the disc thickness",
    "is raised the vortex is progressively distorted being eventually substituted by a single - domain configuration @xcite . in turn , thin rectangular - like samples generally present landau patterns as their remanent ground - states @xcite .",
    "+ it is widely recognized that the total energy of a magnet with an arbitrary magnetization pattern is not easy to be computed , even assuming simple geometries and negligible anisotropies . with these simplifications , exchange and magnetostatic contributions",
    "remain to be evaluated @xcite .",
    "the latter one is generally much more complicated once it comes from long - range dipole - dipole interactions . for special configurations , like vortices and",
    "some aligned states , and/or simple geometries , like those curvatureless , say , planar - type and cylinder , its evaluation is greatly simplified and may be sometimes exactly computed . for more general situations , the available tools for doing that often relies on approximate methods , e.g. , assuming the nanomagnet as a continuum sample ( analytical treatments ) and/or performing numerical evaluation of the energy @xcite . for the specific cases of the square - type and cylindrical shapes , considerable amount of information are available with relatively good agreement between experimental and theoretical studies @xcite . for other geometries",
    ", a detailed knowledge is still lacking , although some works have dealt with nanosized magnetic spheres @xcite , wires @xcite , tubes @xcite and rings @xcite .",
    "+ whenever designing novel magneto - electronic mechanisms based upon vortex - like states , namely those for logic memory and/or data storage , an issue of prime importance concerns miniaturization of each nanomagnet and consequently of the whole array comprising a large number of them .",
    "since current transistor - based memory elements have reached below @xmath6 per element , the departure to nanomagnetic vortex - based mechanisms should offer real potentiality of supporting such stable states at much smaller scales , say , at least around @xmath7 , or less .",
    "there lies a trouble with soft material nanodiscs , where vortex stability is lost if the disc radius gets lower than @xmath8 ( value for permalloy disks with thickness @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "to partially remedy the situation , one may introduce a ( centralized ) hole into the disc , obtaining a nanoring , where a vortex - state may be stabilized at smaller radius ( @xmath10 , for internal radius and thickness about @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "physically , the presence of the hole becomes the core formation no longer necessary , diminishing exchange cost considerably and giving extra stability to vortex configuration even at smaller scales , see refs .",
    "however , disappearing with the core , we immediately loose the vortex polarization , remaining only its chirality ( sense of dipole rotating , clock or counter - clockwise ) as bit storage media",
    ". additionally , dipole dynamics at the edge borders may still jeopardize vortex stability due to large fluctuations of surface magnetic charges , @xmath11 , once at these places the normal vector @xmath12 is not well - defined ( in other words , curvature blows up at disc and hole edge borders ) . such fluctuations may be somewhat bypassed and their effects minimized if the centralized hole is large so that the nanoring width is sufficiently small , less than a domain - wall size , say , around a couple of exchange length ( @xmath13 , for permalloy ) . doing that we also ensure that no vortex core can be formed in the ring @xcite . + here",
    ", we would like to consider a number of magnetization patterns lying in the toroidal manifold .",
    "specifically , we compute the net energy ( exchange + magnetostatic ) of ferromagnetic ( single - domain , sd ) , vortex and onion - like states .",
    "our main results may be divided according nanotori internal radius , @xmath14 : for small values , @xmath15 , sd appears to be the ground - state if @xmath16 , being substituted by a vortex configuration whenever @xmath17 .",
    "thus , even in a very small torus , say , with @xmath18 , we may have a stable vortex if @xmath19 . on the other hand , if @xmath20 only the vortex pattern appears to minimize the net energy , despite the aspect ratio .",
    "such a vortex stability , even at very small scales , should be attributed to the toroidal geometry , where curvature varies smoothly , preventing large fluctuations of surface charges at the edges , as may occur in nanorings .",
    "a direct consequence concerns the possibility of great improvement in miniaturization using stable vortices lying in tori as media for binary storage and logic .",
    "note that such vortices are coreless , leaving only their chirality at our disposal .",
    "however , the vortex core absence is an important property when we consider applications where non - interacting magnetic elements concern .",
    "for example , the reduced dipole - dipole interaction may , in this situation , increases the vortex - state stability for small intertori separation distances , whenever compared to its interdiscs counterpart .",
    "such a feature may be important for fabricating arrays with higher density , using nanotori as the basic elements .",
    "for applications in cancer therapy , the vanishing magnetization in remanence is significant because this reduces the long - range magnetostatic forces responsible for particle agglomeration .",
    "+ to our best knowledge , there is so far no work reporting the fabrication of magnetic nanotori . the best we have found in the literature concerns some possibilities of producing such structures using their carbon - made analogues as a sort of substrate where a suitable magnetic material could be formed either by capping the surface with a thin layer or by injecting the material inside to form a nanotorus encapsulated by the layer @xcite . by means of this latter technique , it has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite permalloy - made nanowires with ( internal ) radius around @xmath9 ( other possibilities for nanowires fabrication may be found in refs .",
    "once experimental techniques in nanomagnetism have developed rapidly it is expected that , among other , magnetic nanotori may appear in the near future .",
    "+ at some extent , this work represents a further step from that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we have studied solitons and vortices in the toroidal geometry considering only the exchange energy . here , for dealing with nanostructures their magnetostatic contribution must be also taken into account .",
    "we outline our article as follows : in section 2 , we describe the theoretical model , the torus geometry and the magnetization states under consideration .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analytical results concerning the energy of these magnetic states . in section 4 , we evaluate numerically the previous findings , followed by a suitable discussion about them .",
    "finally , we conclude our work and present a number of prospects for future investigation .",
    "in our approach , a magnetic nanotorus is assumed to be a continuum material where the magnetization vector has the same magnitude throughout it , but can vary in direction from point to point .",
    "its energy comes from short - range exchange ( @xmath21 ) plus long - range dipole - dipole ( magnetostatic , @xmath22 ) interactions , once we assume vanishing anisotropies , i.e. , we are explicitly dealing with isotropic materials , like permalloy ( feni ) and co. therefore , the ground - state will be the configuration which minimizes @xmath23 , which generally depends upon the torus geometry .",
    "explicitly , we have that the exchange term is given by the continuum version of the heisenberg model over the whole volume @xcite : @xmath24dv,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 accounts for the interaction strength among nearest - neighbor spins ( dipoles ) . once we are considering a ferromagnetic sample , @xmath26 ,",
    "so that @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the normalized magnetization and @xmath29 is its satured value . for permalloy",
    ", one has @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so that , @xmath32 .",
    "such a length accounts for the relative importance of each contribution , in such a way that exchange dominates at small distances , @xmath33 , whereas magnetostatic takes over at larger ones , @xmath34 .",
    "this latter energy comes from the interaction experienced by a given dipole due to the remaining ones throughout the magnet . with the additional assumption that no electric current is present , @xmath35",
    ", we formally obtain : @xmath36 with the magnetotatic potential given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the volumetric and superficial densities of effective magnetic charges , respectively . + since our interest concerns ferromagnetic tori , it is instructive to give a survey of its shape with the main features . topologically , an ordinary torus is the simplest two - dimensional closed manifold having genus-1 , a single hole , like depicted in fig .",

    "first , let us recall that the ferromagnetic state is reached when all the dipoles align along the same direction , leading to magnetization saturation . by virtue of the parallelism between neighbor dipoles",
    ", their exchange energy vanishes identically .",
    "in addition , no volumetric magnetic charges take place for this pattern , @xmath47 , so that , only surface charges , @xmath48 , contributes to its magnetostatic energy .",
    "therefore , the results concerning a toroidal surface may be straightforward applied to a volumetric torus . in section 3",
    ", we shall compute the total energy for such a pattern lying along @xmath49 and @xmath50-plane , given respectively by , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( any other direction along @xmath50 is energetically equivalent ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", we shall see that in any torus the @xmath53-state is energetically favorable than its @xmath49 counterpart . +",
    "another relevant state to be considered is that which minimizes magnetostatic term , which is achieved by vanishing both @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to a curly pattern around the torus genus such that its spatial distribution ensures @xmath56 , besides being perpendicular to the surface at every point , so that @xmath57 .",
    "such a vortex - state may be described by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the unit vector along the azimuthal angle , whereas @xmath60 is associated to the vortex chirality , counter- or clockwise , respectively .",
