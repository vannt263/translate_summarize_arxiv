    "a surge of renewed interest in ferromagnetic nanowires has occurred very recently triggered by their interesting properties with respect to spintronic devices and more specifically to non - volatile memory ( mram ) and logic devices  @xcite .    from a fundamental point of view",
    ", they represent a quasi - one dimensional system displaying magnetic properties in sharp contrast to the mermin - wagner  @xcite theorem forbidding ( heisenberg - type ) magnetism in systems of dimension ( @xmath0 ) with short - range interactions .",
    "they are simpler than nanotubes since their physical properties do not depend on chirality and they can be grown in a variety of methods : molecular beam epitaxy , electrochemical methods ( template synthesis , anodic alumina filters ) , chemical solution techniques ( self - assembly , sol - gel , emulsions ... ) etc ...    template synthesis is an electrochemical method used in the manufacturing of nanostructured materials , in particular , nanowires can be obtained by filling a porous polycarbonate membrane , wich contains a large number of cylindical holes that are track - etched and possessing a narrow size distribution .",
    "individual nanowires as well as arrays of nanowires are important .",
    "characterization and understanding of the magnetic properties of nanowire arrays are challenging since we have dipolar interactions between wires in addition to anisotropy , magnetostatic and exchange effects within individual wires .",
    "many questions remain open regarding the detailed mechanisms responsible for the magnetization reversal .",
    "the intrinsic properties of nanowire arrays are directly related to the properties of the nanoporous template such as the relative pore orientations in the assembly , pore size and its distribution , as well as interpore distance .",
    "two reversal modes have been suggested as being important : curling and the coherent rotation depending on the value of the radius @xmath1 with respect a cutoff value also called `` coherence '' radius @xmath2 .    for wire radius @xmath3",
    ", the reversal occurs by curling . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the coherent rotation is expected as predicted by the stoner - wohlfarth model  @xcite .",
    "the remanent magnetization distribution within a nanowire depends on its radius as well as on the balance between different contributions ( anisotropy , magnetostatic / shape and exchange ) to the magnetic energy .",
    "exchange energy dominates at small wire radius and favors a uniform magnetization distribution or non - uniform flower , s , landau , leaf ... states . on the other hand",
    ", this almost collinear spin alignment leads to large demagnetizing fields due to magnetic surface charges and correspondingly increase of the magnetostatic energy which increases gradually with radius .",
    "when the radius increases beyond the single domain limit ( @xmath5 ) , the competition between these two energies and anisotropy energy leads to non - uniform magnetic states such as multi - domain states ( if the anisotropy constant is greater than the magnetostatic energy ) .",
    "it might lead to magnetic vortices , if the anisotropy energy is small in comparison with magnetostatic energy .    in this work",
    ", we set out to study the geometric signature of reversal modes in nanowires depending on the different magnetic properties inherent to the wire belonging to any of the anisotropy , magnetostatic and exchange classes .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section ii , the geometric signature is discussed in the case of an infinite cylinder with a uniaxial anisotropy . in section iii ,",
    "the resulting parametric curve is considered for a general ellipsoid with arbitrary uniaxial anisotropy and finally section iv bears our conclusions .",
    "the geometric signature of a reversal mode is a parametric curve derived from the nanowire magnetization configuration that can be determined from the brown equation by minimizing the total free energy  @xcite .    in bulk ferromagnetic materials ,",
    "the energy of the system can be minimized by forming multiple magnetic domains within which the magnetic moments are aligned .",
    "however , there is a critical size @xmath6 below which a particle remains in a single - domain state during switching ; it is given by the implicit form :    @xmath7}\\ ] ]    derived by frei  @xcite after approximating the nanowire by an ellipsoid of revolution with major axis @xmath8 and minor axis , @xmath9 and comparing the exchange energy averaged over the ellipsoid volume to the average magnetostatic energy ( see fig .  [ nanowire ] ) .     and",
    "long axis @xmath8 .",
    "the nanowire is considered as a single domain with uniaxial anisotropy and in presence of applied field * h*. the long axis of the ellipsoid taken along the @xmath10 direction is also the anisotropy axis .",
    "the @xmath11 frame is such that the equilibrium magnetization @xmath12 direction defines the @xmath13 axis .",
    "@xmath12 lies in the @xmath14 plane as well as the @xmath15 basis obtained from it through rotation by the equilibrium angle @xmath16 ( see appendix).,height=288 ]    for nickel , the following parameters might be used : @xmath17 emu/@xmath18 , @xmath19 nm @xcite .",
    "the curling reversal mode is the dominant magnetization reversal process in magnetic nanowires .",
    "the magnetization curling mode was defined by frei  @xcite and after it has used for different structure to investigate the magnetic switching of films , spherical particles , prolate ellipsoid and cylinders  @xcite .",
    "the coherence radius @xmath2 separating uniform rotation and curling is given by :    @xmath20    @xmath21 is the exchange stiffness ( @xmath22 erg / cm for bulk nickel and cobalt ) , @xmath23 is the saturation magnetization and @xmath24 is the demagnetization coefficient along the nanowire radius ( see fig .  [ nanowire ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 , is the smallest positive zero of the first kind bessel function @xmath26 derivative @xmath27  @xcite ( i.e. smallest positive maximum ) and the smallest of the derivative of all ellipsoidal harmonics",
    ". it has been evaluated by aharoni @xcite to a @xmath28 accuracy .",
    "he also found an accurate interpolation formula for any aspect ratio @xmath29 : @xmath30    with coefficients : @xmath31 , that are accurate to @xmath32 .    for particle size larger than @xmath2 yet smaller than @xmath6 ,",
    "magnetization reversal proceeds through curling . in this mode ,",
    "magnetization switching is an abrupt process , and the switching field is very close to the nucleation field for all angles .    in the case of an infinite cylinder with a uniaxial anisotropy along the axis @xmath33 , two distinct calculations were made independently by chung and muller  @xcite and ishii  @xcite 20 years apart .",
    "the curling equations ( see appendix ) to be solved are :    ( - ) & = & - 2 + ( - ) & = & ^2 --    it is remarkable that the constant @xmath34 that appears in @xmath35 is a rational approximation to the first zero of the bessel function derivative @xmath27 .",
    "this originates from the way ishii  @xcite used the bessel function in the average energy calculation ( see appendix and next section ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is the reduced radius defined as @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the exchange length  @xcite considered as an intrinsic length scale of the nanowire ( e.g. @xmath38=20.6 nm for nickel ) .",

    "let us consider the general case of an ellipsoid with fourth - order uniaxial anisotropy characterized by two constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "following aharoni  @xcite , wegrowe  @xcite performed a detailed study of template synthesised nickel nanowires and concluded that the anisotropy of their nanowires is positive and large ( recall that for bulk nickel , the lowest order _ cubic _ anisotropy constants  @xcite are @xmath50 erg/@xmath18 and @xmath51 erg/@xmath18 at room temperature ) arguing that a large strain acting on the nanowires may induce such a large anisotropy change .",
    "the curling equations to be solved in presence of fourth - order uniaxial anisotropy are :    ( - ) & = & f ( ) + ( - ) & = & g ( )    with the definitions :    f ( ) & = & ( n_a -n_c + + ^2 ) 2 + g ( ) & = & 2(n_a ^2 + n_c ^2 ) - - ( 3 ^2 -1 ) -2 ( 5 ^2 -1 ) ^2 + [ curl ]    the parameter @xmath52 with @xmath53 according to aharoni s  @xcite work , is a monotonically decreasing function of the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid like the parameter @xmath25 ( see introduction ) . as an example , when @xmath54 the nickel nanowire radius is about 41.2 nm ( see figs .",

    "in conclusion , by means of theoretical studies and experimental measurements , we have investigated the reversal processes in ferromagnetic nanowires .",
    "our systematic studies of the effect of the nanowire radius show that the magnetization reversal mechanism is strongly influenced by its value .",
