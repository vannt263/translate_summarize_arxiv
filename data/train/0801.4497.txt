    ", this line of research has been extended to quantum systems .",
    "the novel aspect of these developments is the possibility to study the interplay of complex dynamics and quantum phenomena .",
    "thus the interaction with a composite environment with extra degrees of freedom , and the entanglement of the quantum system with the latter , has for instance be shown to lead to power - law decay @xcite .",
    "the relaxation of a quantum two - level system subjected to stationary and nonstationary power - law noise has been respectively examined in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . in the latter work",
    ", the presence of aging dephasing has been demonstrated .",
    "additionally , anomalous fast decoherence induced by spatial lvy noise , stemming from a chaotic random - matrix environment , has been investigated in ref .",

    "our approach in the present work has been to use the quantum kicked rotator as a powerful tool to explore decoherence and its interplay with complex quantum dynamics , in particular , nonstationarity .",

    "taking advantage of the unique degree of tunability of the atom - optical realization of the kicked rotator , we have put forward a way to engineer a complex reservoir , providing full control over the stationarity of the environment or the absence thereof .",

    "can actually be regarded as corresponding to a ctrw with power - law waiting time , but with a renormalized diffusion range given by the localization length of the kicked rotator .    at this point , it is appropriate to mention that anomalous diffusion has been shown before to occur in quantum kicked rotators subjected to _ deterministic _",
    "aperiodic kicking .",
    "more precisely , subballistic wave packet spreading induced by quasiperiodic fibonacci kick sequences has been established both away and at resonance @xcite .",
    "the effect of lvy noise at resonance has also been the subject of a recent study @xcite . an important difference to",
    "the present study is the fact that these studies do not consider the simultaneous presence of the periodic kicks in the intervals between the noise events . as a consequence ,",
    "the classical momentum dynamics for the quasiperiodically kicked systems is subdiffusive , and hence does not differ qualitatively from the quantum dynamics .",
    "the protocol proposed in the present paper stipulates the presence of such periodic kicks , which induce diffusive classical momentum dynamics , while quantum mechanically they drive the system towards localization .",
    "the ensuing qualitative difference between the noiseless quantum and classical dynamics indeed provides the terrain in which we explore the consequences of decoherence .",
    "the theory of decoherence that we have developed in this paper combines the properties of lvy noise , encoded in the generating function of the number of noisy events ( [ eq : mdef ] ) , and a random - phase approximation , which exploits the complex quantum dynamics of the rotator appearing in the quasienergy transition amplitudes ( [ eq : transition ] ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that it is nonperturbative ( with respect to time ) and applies both to stationary and nonstationary noise .",
    "one of the central results of our paper , contained in eq.([eq : mlp ] ) , is the demonstration of a regime of nonexponential loss of phase coherence when the noise is nonstationary ( lvy exponent @xmath43 ) . this regime is characterized by an infinite coherence time , indicating that classical behavior can never be attained , even though the amplitude of the noise is dramatically increased by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this remarkable property finds its origin in the divergence of the mean waiting time between random kicks and hence in the absence of a characteristic time scale in the engineered reservoir .",
    "the existence of a regime of slow decoherence has direct consequence for experimentally accessible physical quantities of the kicked rotator .",
    "we have first shown that the momentum spreading ( [ eq : subdiff ] ) is subdiffusive and that the momentum profile retains a double - sided exponential shape , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "these asymptotic features are in stark contrast to those in the usual decoherence regime , here realized for lvy exponent @xmath53 , which is characterized by normal diffusion and a gaussian profile .",

    "the variance of the momentum is accessible up to times of the order of ten break times @xmath131 , indicating that the subdiffusive dynamics depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] is measurable with current setups .",
    "two other important quantities that we have considered are the fidelity and the purity ( or average fidelity ) , which are more traditional quantities for the characterization of decoherence . here",
    "again we have found clear signatures of the nonexponential decoherence regime . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : purity ] ) we have established a direct connection between the purity on the one hand and the decoherence factor and the inverse participation on the other . as a consequence",

    "[ fig:8 ] ) .",
    "the fidelity can be directly measured in echo experiments , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , however to our knowledge such a measurement has not yet been performed in kicked rotator experiments .",
    "we also mention that we have found a direct relationship ( [ eq : ff1 ] ) between the averaged logarithm of the fidelity and the sprinkling distribution of the renewal process .    our concluding message is that reservoir engineering can be extended to mimic the coupling to complex nonstationary environments , allowing to control in a precise manner the loss of phase coherence and reveal hitherto unexplored decoherence scenarios .",

    "<S> we develop a theory describing the dynamics of quantum kicked rotators ( modelling cold atoms in a pulsed optical field ) which are subjected to combined amplitude and timing noise generated by a renewal process ( acting as an engineered reservoir ) . for waiting - time distributions of variable exponent ( lvy noise ) , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the existence of a regime of nonexponential loss of phase coherence . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the momentum dynamics is subdiffusive , which also manifests itself in a non - gaussian limiting distribution and a fractional power - law decay of the inverse participation ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the purity initially decays with a stretched exponential which is followed by two regimes of power - law decay with different exponents . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged logarithm of the fidelity probes the sprinkling distribution of the renewal process . </S>",
    "<S> these analytical results are confirmed by numerical computations on quantum kicked rotators subjected to noise events generated by a yule - simon distribution . </S>"
