    "reaction - diffusion equations of the same type as , with or without additional noise , arise , for example , in models for the motion of molecular motors .",
    "actually , one of the possible ways to model brownian motors / ratchets is to describe them as particles traveling along a designated track , and the designated track along which the molecule / particle is traveling can be viewed as a tubular domain with many _ wings _ added to it . to this purpose , see e.g. @xcite .    in this paper , we are interested in the limiting behavior of the solution @xmath16 of equation , as @xmath17 . for this purpose , suppose for a moment that the noisy term @xmath18 is replaced by a regular enough function @xmath19 and , for the sake of brevity , assume @xmath20 . if @xmath21 is the diffusion process in @xmath22 governed by the operator @xmath23 inside @xmath0 and undergoing instantaneous reflections at @xmath2 , with respect to the co - normal associated with @xmath23 , then , as is well known ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the solution of can be written in the form @xmath24 where , for any @xmath25 , @xmath26    the process @xmath21 has a slow component @xmath27 and a fast component @xmath28 , if @xmath29 .",
    "this means that , before @xmath27 changes a little , the @xmath30-component of the process hits the boundary many times .",
    "this leads to an additional drift in the limit of the @xmath31-component of the process , due to the changing width of the domain and to the averaging of the function @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , for a given @xmath31 , the intersection of the domain @xmath0 with the vertical line containing @xmath33 can consist of several connected components ( see e.g. the intervals @xmath34 and @xmath35 in figure 1 ) .",
    "this leads to the fact that the slow component of the process @xmath21 lives on the graph @xmath36 ( see again figure 1 ) .",

    "the process @xmath37 , up to a time change , is our non perturbed system .",
    "thus , the slow component of the perturbed system ( the process @xmath21 on @xmath22 ) is the projection @xmath40 of @xmath21 on the simplex of normalized invariant measures of the original system .",

    "concerning limit , it follows from an averaging argument , but its proof requires a suitable localization in time in the same spirit of khasminski s paper @xcite . here",
