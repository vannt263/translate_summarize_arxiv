    "relaxation oscillators have become a base for constituting coupled systems that generate a variety of self - sustained rhythms .",
    "these types of oscillators are used to model heart beats @xcite , cellular membrane dynamics @xcite , electrical and mechanical systems @xcite , harmful algae bloom @xcite , regulatory genetic networks @xcite , and the population dynamics of pest cycles of forests @xcite .",
    "simple relaxation oscillations are formed by two essential variables : one _ activity variable _ assumes active and inactive states , and one _ recovery variable _ regulates and completes the activity cycle by destabilizing the activity states , and thus leading to recurrent switching .",
    "the activity variable exhibits dynamic hysteresis in which the state of activity is bi - stable if the recovery variable is held constant .",
    "for example in neuronal dynamics , the cell membrane voltage determines the state of neuronal activity .",
    "the state becomes active as the voltage depolarizes .",
    "this depolarization occurs when the potassium - ion conductance , i.e.  the recovery variable , falls below a threshold . in return , the depolarized , active membrane voltage opens voltage - dependent k@xmath0-gates causing the k@xmath0-conductance to increase .",
    "such increases beyond another threshold cause the active state of the membrane voltage to destabilize , and thereby to complete the cycle .",
    "while more detailed models can exhibit other complex types of neuronal activity , such as sub - threshold oscillations and bursting @xcite , this mechanism of hysteresis , which guides the relaxation oscillations , is retained .",
    "coupling among relaxation oscillators is introduced through interactions of their activity variables .",
    "prominent biological examples of coupled systems include neuronal populations connected by chemical synapses and gap junctions @xcite , as well as single - cell organisms communicating via signaling molecules @xcite .",
    "we distinguish two types of connections : _ excitatory _ connections promote and support the active state , and _ inhibitory _ connections repress the active state and hold the inactive state of the oscillator . note that neuronal gap junctions and other types of diffusive coupling do not fall into either of these categories .",
    "networked oscillators typically show a degree of coordination among their individual cycles .",
    "reciprocal excitation between two oscillators leads to their synchrony , whereas inhibition forces them to oscillate in anti - phase @xcite .",

    "our continuing goal is to develop the theory of rhythmogenesis to predict changes in rhythm stability , and to determine the robustness of rhythms in an oscillatory network given its circuitry .    in this paper , we generalize previous results to three - node circuits constituted of generic relaxation oscillators with relevance outside of computational neuroscience .",
    "we adopt and counterpose a variety analysis techniques for polyrythmic circuits and highlight their individual strengths .",
    "our complimentary techniques of phase reduction , bifurcation theory , perturbation theory , and stochastic dynamics lets us describe a near - maximal range of dynamical regimes including different separations of time scale between activity and recovery variables , bifurcations in individual nodes , and a range of coupling strengths from weak to strong .",
    "we find that stability and robustness of circuit rhythms strongly depend on the parameters of oscillators in the circuit . in the vicinity of their individual bifurcations , abrupt changes in the circuit dynamics",

    "furthermore , we demonstrate that qualitative and quantitative stability of polyrhythms do not align completely , thereby leading us to new hypotheses concerning polyrhythmic circuits .",

    "generally , robust pacemaker rhythms can be achieved at larger values of @xmath10 , where the wave rhythms are less stable . at @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath23 , for example ,",
    "all five rhythms coexist , but the wave rhythm is close to its stability boundary ( cf .",
    "[ fig : bifdiag](a ) ) . here",
    ", pacemaker rhythms were commonly observed in randomly perturbed traces of circuit dynamics , as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : d](e ) .",
    "one might expect to enhance stability of pacemaker rhythms by further reducing @xmath8 below the stability boundary of the wave rhythms .",
    "however , the circuit dynamics closer to the release case turns out to be highly vulnerable , especially below the hard - lock transition ( dashed - dotted [ pink ] line ) . in this region ,",
    "switching caused by noise among the three coexisting pacemaker rhythms becomes very frequent ( cf .",
    "[ fig : d](f ) ) .",
    "the increased intensity of switching is analogous to the observations in three - cell motifs of the hodgkin - huxley type bursters in ref .",
    "@xcite , that demonstrated even weak noise can disrupt the pacemaker rhythms subjected to the hard - lock inhibition occurring in the release case .    .",
    "]    the closer the circuit is set to the release case ( lower @xmath8 ) , the higher the diffusion rate , @xmath95 , becomes in the two - dimensional plane of phase differences .",
    "we used several methods to carry out the qualitative and quantitative stability analysis of the circuit polyrhythms .",
    "the qualitative stability was assessed by standard phase reduction , phase mappings , phase - basin analysis , and direct bifurcation continuation .",
    "the quantitative stability was assessed by local methods of stability analysis derived from standard phase reduction , and the floquet exponents of continued periodic orbits .",
    "it was also counterposed to random perturbation analysis in its effect on phase diffusion . +",
    "* qualitative methods . * geometric and symmetry arguments in an all - to - all coupled circuit of oscillators grants the existence of periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "however , these arguments can not be applied to show whether the corresponding rhythms ( orbits ) are stable or not .",
    "methods of automatic bifurcation analysis can answer this question successfully as demonstrated in this study ( cf .",
    "[ fig : bifdiag ] ) .",
    "the approach fails , however , if circuit rhythms bifurcate . in the example of the wave rhythm",
    ", a torus bifurcation leaves the associated periodic orbit unstable ; disregarding the resulting low - amplitude jiggle , the wave rhythm is still intact . in the example , the torus - bifurcation line ( green dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifdiag](a ) ) still coincides well with the border of wave instability , but only by the coincidence that the torus is stable for a small range of parameters . in such cases ,",
    "the methods of phase description , such as return maps , are able to qualify that the torus orbit is still _ close _ to the wave rhythm ( cf .",
    "[ fig : waverhythm_bif](c ) ) .",
    "the phase approach is applied with three different methods in this work . in the weak coupling approximation ,",
    "the standard method of phase reduction describes phase perturbations of individual periodic orbits by the phase resetting curve ( prc ) to linear order .",
    "the method has many numerical advantages .",
    "the prc is obtained by only regarding an individual oscillator ; subsequently it can be used to explore the phase dynamics of arbitrarily large networks .",
    "moreover , a high precision can be reached because the method does not require forward integration of the full circuit dynamics .",
    "one can therefore compute fixed points , as well as their eigenvalues of the phase flow , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : prcbifdiag ] .",
    "as coupling is strengthened , the standard phase reduction fails to produce correct results because the individual periodic orbits become increasingly distorted by the inhibitory coupling .",
    "however , in principle , the phase dynamics remain slow compared to that for the amplitudes .",
    "therefore , one can still compute the return maps from first return times of individual oscillations to reconstruct the phase flow . the distance between consecutive phase lags in the mapping",
    "will increase with stronger coupling because the phase dynamics become fast compared to the oscillation period . eventually , phase trajectories are not discernible anymore and the phase - mappings method will fail .",
    "nevertheless , when phases jump erratically , it is still possible to re - construct some practical aspects of the phase dynamics , for example , the basins of attraction and their boundaries . in the brute - force scheme",
    ", the initial conditions can only form a topological equivalent of the individual periodic orbit .",
    "therefore , the geometry of the basins is strongly distorted .",
    "for example , the basins of the pacemaker rhythms may not appear equally sized , even though they are in this symmetric circuit ( cf .",
    "[ fig : torus](d ) ) .",
    "+ * quantitative methods . * harder than the stability or instability of a circuit rhythm is the evaluation how stable a rhythm is .",
    "we used two approaches , in this work , to quantify stability depending on the assumed disturbances to the circuit dynamics : approaches of linear stability measure the effect of infinitesimal perturbations , whereas approaches with finite perturbations such as noise investigate the full polyrhythmic stability , or robustness .",
    "infinitesimal perturbations can not excite the circuit to switch from a stable rhythm to another .",
    "the wave and pacemaker rhythms have to be regarded separately . from such an element - wise description of polyrhythmicity",
    ", it is hard to predict the outcome of the switching behavior through kramer s rates , for example .",
    "this would only be possible if one were able to quantify a height of an assumed potential barrier separating stable circuit rhythms .",
    "phase diffusion coefficients of noise - perturbed circuit dynamics , on the other hand , quantify random transitions between stable circuit rhythms .",
    "this measure is typically dominated by the most stable circuit rhythms , as highlighted in the examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] .",
    "the least stable rhythms take the role of unstable saddles at finite noise strengths , but may also serve as facilitating intermediates .",
    "small circuits of inhibitory relaxation oscillators appear in many natural systems in order to flexibly generate rhythmic patterns of activity phases . in this article",
    ", we applied several computational methods to gain global understanding of the dynamical transitions in a circuit of three mutually inhibitory relaxation oscillators .",
    "we find that the two wave and three pacemaker rhythms , predicted to coexist in the circuit due to permutation symmetry , strongly depend on quantitative and qualitative features of the node dynamics and inhibitory coupling .    as a generic model of relaxation oscillations",
    ", we adopted a fitzhugh - nagumo - like system that exhibits two saddle - node bifurcations , beyond which oscillations stall .",
    "one bifurcation inactivates the oscillators , while the other stabilizes its active state .",
    "these dynamical regimes are non - generic for oscillators , but occur often in natural systems to facilitate flexible control of frequency and rhythmicity .",
    "comparison of our results using the generic model and those of @xcite and @xcite highlight to what extent the generic model can approximate hodgkin - huxley type bursting models . while the release case is well represented @xcite , the two models differ in the escape case where spikes play an active role in rhythmogenesis @xcite .    in our investigations , we find that closeness to bifurcations of individual oscillators has a profound effect on the dynamics of the whole circuit : a generic inhibitory circuit produces the wave rhythms , but close to the inactivating bifurcation , we find that the wave rhythms can become unstable to give room for pacemaker rhythms .",
    "we find the same dynamical instabilities in the case of strong inhibition .",
    "past the hard - lock transition , all active phases of mutually inhibitory neurons need to be non - overlapping .",
    "this is possible in our three - node circuit where , conversely , wave rhythms may still be observed .",
    "however , for circuits consisting of more nodes , waves can become unstable due to such a crowding effect .",
    "the method of phase basins described in this article gives a natural extension to the return maps of @xcite , that allows for the treatment of strong coupling in polyrhythmic circuits .",
    "tracking phase basins across coupling strengths allows us to identify bifurcations that can be utilized for the control of rhythms in the circuit .",
    "such coupling control may be of particular experimental relevance in neuroscience , because inhibitory synaptic strengths are easily modifiable by chemical agents .",
    "quantitative stability of polyrhythmicity is particularly hard to explore because transitions can occur at any phase of a stable periodic orbit to another .",
    "we add noise to the dynamics to excite this potentially large number of switching paths . for weak noise ,",
    "only the most probable paths are excited , thus , revealing a skeleton of vulnerability in the full polyrhythmic dynamics .",
    "the adoption of phase diffusion to quantify such stability features has advantages over other possible methods , such as deviants of recurrences @xcite , or coarse - grained markov chain descriptions @xcite .",
    "the main advantage is the intrinsic invariance of the phase diffusion constant @xcite , that allows for a reliable estimation of complex features of the circuit dynamics . to understand the unfolding complexity of polyrhtymic switching",
    ", more refined techniques of stochastic analysis will be necessary .",
