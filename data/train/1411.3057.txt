    "understanding properties of nucleon - nucleon interactions under extreme conditions of spin , isospin , and density is one of the forefronts of both nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "it is well known that bare nucleon - nucleon interactions are spin - isospin dependent . as a result ,",
    "nucleon mean - field potentials in nuclear medium are also spin - isospin dependent as shown by various many - body approaches in the literature . on one hand ,",
    "much progress has been made in recent years in studying effects of the isospin dependence of nuclear interactions on properties of nuclei , nuclear reactions , neutron stars and gravitational waves  @xcite , and many interesting questions remain to be addressed  @xcite . on the other hand , there are also many interesting questions regarding the spin dependence of nuclear interactions to be answered .",
    "it is well known that the spin - orbit coupling is one of the most important spin - dependent nuclear interactions and it has many significant effects on the structure of nuclei  @xcite . however , detailed properties of the spin - orbit potential , such as its strength , isospin dependence  @xcite , and density dependence  @xcite , are still poorly known and are current topics of intensive investigations .",
    "these studies are relevant for our understanding of the structures of rare isotopes and their impacts on astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spin and isospin dependence of nuclear interactions are often intertwined .",
    "thus , the study of spin - isospin correlation is an interesting topic in its own right .    in nuclear reactions , while the spin - dependent interaction has been shown to be critical in understanding some features of few - body reactions within various models , its effects in heavy - ion collisions are less known .",
    "usually only spin - averaged nucleon interactions are used in transport model studies of heavy - ion collisions mostly due to the difficulties in measuring spin - dependent observables . nevertheless , encouraged by the recent progress in developing spin polarized beams and measuring the analyzing power used to quantify the spin - asymmetry in nuclear reactions ,",
    "we are optimistic that experimental studies of spin physics with heavy ions will be possible in the near future . for example",
    ", spin polarized beams can now be produced with nucleon removal or pickup reactions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , an analyzing power as large as 100@xmath0 can be achieved in pp or pa scattering at certain energies and scattering angles  @xcite , providing a possible way to disentangle nucleons with different spins in the final state of the reaction .",
    "heavy - ion collisions create nuclear medium of varying density and isospin asymmetry .",
    "they may thus be used as a testing ground of in - medium properties of nuclear spin - orbit interactions .    to provide a theoretical tool for studying spin physics with heavy - ion reactions , by incorporating the nuclear spin - orbit interaction and the nucleon spin degree of freedom explicitly into an earlier version of nuclear transport model",
    ", we have developed the spin- and isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehing - uhlenbeck transport model ( sibuu12 ) , and studied the spin splitting of transverse flows in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar approach based on the quantum molecular dynamics model was developed more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work , by incorporating the quantum description of spin dynamics derived in ref .",
    "@xcite into the sibuu12 transport model , we investigate in detail the spin - dependent collective flows of both single nucleons and light clusters in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "we found that the spin up - down splittings of the directed flow and elliptic flow are largest in peripheral au+au collisions at beam energies of about 100 - 200 mev / nucleon , and a larger spin splitting effect is observed in the present work with a quantum description of spin dynamics compared to earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we outline the framework and give the major ingredients of the sibuu12 transport model using a quantum description of spin dynamics  @xcite , where the nuclear spin - orbit coupling and the explicit spin states of nucleons have been incorporated .",

    "the time - even and time - odd potentials should be included .",
    "it is also worth noting that the spin - dependent potential from the shf calculation is quadratic in momentum @xmath30 , so is that from the lowest - order non - relativistic expansion of the dirac equation based on the relativistic mean - field approach  @xcite .",
    "it can be of great interest to study effects of the momentum dependence of the spin - orbit coupling on the spin dynamics .    in the quantum description of spin dynamics ,",
    "since the total angular momentum in non - central heavy - ion collisions is in the @xmath31 direction perpendicular to the reaction plane , we define the nucleons with spin in @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) direction as the spin - up ( spin - down ) nucleons . by generalizing the test - particle method  @xcite for both spin - up and spin - down particles ,",
    "the spin - dependent bv equation can be solved numerically , and the equations of motion ( eoms ) for the test particles can be written as  @xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 for spin - up nucleons and @xmath36 for spin - down ones .",

    "( [ epsilon ] ) in deriving the above eoms , where @xmath39 is assumed to be momentum independent and reproduces the empirical saturation properties of nuclear matter .",
    "correspondingly , the number , spin , momentum , and spin - current densities can be calculated from the test - particle method via @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the number of test particles per nucleon .",
    "the initial density distributions of the projectile and target nuclei are obtained from hartree - fock calculations using a modified skyrme interaction  @xcite .",
    "the spins of initial nucleons are assumed to be randomly distributed , i.e. , half spin - up and half spin - down , by neglecting the shell effect and the spin of a nucleus . since the spin of a nucleon may flip after nucleon - nucleon scatterings but its dependence on the energy and isospins of the colliding nucleons is poorly known , to focus on effects from the spin - dependent nuclear mean - field potential we randomize the spin state of nucleons after their successful scatterings .",
    "we notice that the spin- and isospin - dependent pauli blocking is also consistently implemented .",
    "similar to the stern - gerlach experiment , nucleons with different spins are expected to have different dynamics according to the spin - dependent eoms , and this will lead to the spin splitting of the final observables to be discussed in the following .",
    "in this section , we examine effects of the spin - orbit interaction on the dynamics of spin transport and several experimental observables . to ease the following discussions , we first illustrate the density evolution in au+au collisions at a beam energy of 100 mev / nucleon and an impact parameter of @xmath42 fm in fig .",
    "[ den ] . in the present setup of projectile and target ,",
    "a local polarization is observed and the participant ( spectator ) matter is slightly spin polarized in the @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) direction .",
    "however , one can estimate that this spin polarization leads to a negligible contribution to the time - even and time - odd spin - dependent mean - field potentials , compared to the contributions from the @xmath43 and @xmath44 expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ h3 ] ) , with the latter displayed respectively in the third and fourth row in fig .  [ den ] .",

    "we investigate the collective flows of single nucleons that freeze out from the rest of the system at a local density less than @xmath58 .",
    "the directed flow characterizes the collective motion in the reaction plane .",
    "figure  [ v1 ] shows the directed flows of all nucleons as well as those for spin - up and spin - down nucleons in au+au collisions at different beam energies and impact parameters , and the statistical errors are negligibly small if not shown . because of different initializations of the projectile and the target in the momentum - coordinate space in simulations , the slope of the directed flow in our simulations might be opposite in sign compared to results obtained using other conventions of initializing nuclei . due to the competition between the attractive mean - field potential in the energy range considered and the repulsive nucleon - nucleon scattering , the directed flow increases with increasing beam energy , and",
    "the slope is largest at @xmath59 fm and changes sign at @xmath60 fm .",
    "interestingly , one can observe clearly the flow splitting of spin - up and spin - down nucleons .",
    "the flow difference is mainly due to the residue potential from the cancellation of the time - even and the time - odd potential as discussed above , with spin - up ( spin - down ) nucleons affected by a more attractive ( repulsive ) potential and thus leading to a smaller ( larger ) or more ( less ) negative directed flow .        in order to quantify the spin splitting of the directed flow ,",
    "we defined the spin up - down differential directed flow as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of nucleons with rapidity @xmath52 , and @xmath63 is @xmath64 for spin - up ( spin - down ) nucleons .",
    "the above differential directed flow largely cancels the effect from spin - independent potentials while highlights the spin splitting of the flow as a result of spin - dependent potentials .",
    "results for the spin up - down differential directed flow in au+au collisions at different beam energies and different impact parameters are shown in fig .",
    "one sees from figs .",
    "[ v1 ] and [ v1ud ] that the magnitude of the differential directed flow can be as large as @xmath65 of the total directed flow in some cases . on the other hand ,",
    "the differential directed flow is generally stronger with increasing impact parameter , different from the total directed flow as show in fig .",
    "this is because the spin - dependent potentials are mostly related to the gradient of density or current , and it is thus a surface effect which is more important at larger impact parameters due to the diffusive density distribution of finite nuclei .",
    "in addition , as the angular momentum of heavy - ion collisions increases with increasing beam energy , the differential directed flow as a result of the nucleon spin - orbit coupling increases with increasing beam energy . on the other hand , the violent nucleon - nucleon scatterings , which play a more important role at higher collision energies , randomize the nucleon spin and thus wash out some of the effects from the spin - related potential .",
    "therefore , the spin up - down differential directed flow becomes weaker at higher energies ( not shown here ) .",
    "the competition between the above two effects leads to a maximum of the differential directed flow at beam energies around 100 - 200 mev / nucleon in mid - central and peripheral au+au collisions simulated using a spin - orbit coupling quadratic in momentum from the shf approach .",
    "the energy range for the maximum spin up - down differential flow can be different if a different momentum dependence of the spin - orbit coupling is used .",
    "au + @xmath66au and @xmath67sn + @xmath67sn collisions at beam energies of 50 , 100 , and 200 mev / nucleon at the same centrality . the density profiles for @xmath66au and @xmath67sn are shown in the inset . ]",
    "we have also studied the system - size dependence of both the total directed flow and the spin up - down differential directed flow at different beam energies , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ massdp ] . here",
    "we choose an impact parameter of @xmath42 fm for @xmath66au + @xmath66au collisions and @xmath68 fm for @xmath67sn + @xmath67sn collisions so that the two colliding systems have the same @xmath69 and can be compared at the same centrality .",
    "it is seen that the directed flow is larger for @xmath66au + @xmath66au collisions than for @xmath67sn + @xmath67sn collisions at different beam energies due to the higher density reached in the heavier system and thus a higher pressure which leads to a larger directed flow . on the other hand , the spin up - down differential directed flow for @xmath66au + @xmath66au collisions is slightly larger at the beam energies of 50 and 100 mev / nucleon and slightly smaller at the beam energy of 200 mev / nucleon than that for @xmath67sn + @xmath67sn collisions .",
    "the similar spin up - down differential directed flow is due to the similar density gradient near the nucleus surface for @xmath66au and @xmath67sn as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ massdp ] , which leads to a similar strength of the spin - dependent potentials .",
    "it is thus seen that the spin splitting of the directed flow is a robust phenomena even in smaller systems .",
    "the elliptic flow is a measure of the expansion of the almond - shaped medium formed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is a result of the competition between the squeeze - out flow perpendicular to the reaction plane and the in - plane flow .",
    "its dynamics is thus more complicated than the directed flow itself .",
    "more quantitatively , the in - plane hydrodynamical flow and the out - of - plane squeeze - out flow contributes positively and negatively to the elliptic flow , respectively .",
    "figure  [ v2 ] displays respectively the elliptic flows of all free nucleons , spin - up nucleons , and spin - down nucleons in au + au collisions at different beam energies and impact parameters .",
    "one sees that the sign of the elliptic flow changes from positive at lower energies to negative at higher energies . this is a result of blocking effects from the spectator on the expansion of the participant  @xcite",
    "moreover , it is seen that the energy at which the elliptic flow changes sign depends on the impact parameter .",
    "similar to the case for the directed flow , the spin splitting of the elliptic flow is observed and the effect is more appreciable in peripheral collisions at beam energies of about 100 - 200 mev / nucleon , from the shf spin - orbit coupling .",
    "however , the dynamics is more complicated as the magnitude of the elliptic flow depends on the nucleon potential as well as the shadowing from the spectator . in this case",
    ", a more attractive ( repulsive ) potential for spin - up ( spin - down ) nucleons somehow leads to a larger @xmath70 .",
    "we have also observed that in this collision situation neutrons with more repulsive potential than protons have a smaller @xmath70 when the coulomb potential is turned off , confirming the validity of our argument on the relative @xmath70 splitting and the potential difference .        to quantify the spin splitting of the elliptic flow",
    ", we can similarly define the spin up - down differential elliptic flow @xmath71 and the rapidity dependence of @xmath72 is shown in fig .",
    "consistent with fig .",
    "[ v2 ] , it is seen that the differential elliptic flow increases with increasing impact parameter and collision energy , and its magnitude can be as large as @xmath65 of the total elliptic flow in peripheral collisions at beam energies of 100 - 200 mev / nucleon .",
    "we have also studied the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow for mid - rapidity spin - up and spin - down nucleons , and the results in peripheral au+au collisions at beam energies of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 mev / nucleon are shown in fig .",
    "the elliptic flow for spin - up nucleons are larger than that for spin - down nucleons , and the difference is larger at higher nucleon transverse momenta .",
    "this is understandable since the strength of the spin - related potentials increases with increasing nucleon momentum as one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ h3 ] ) .",
    "the spin up - down differential flows defined above can be good probes of the nuclear spin - dependent interaction . as an illustration , the differential directed flows and elliptic flows from using different values of the nuclear spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath13",
    "are compared in fig .",
    "it is seen that when the value of @xmath13 decreases from 150 mev@xmath15 to 80 mev@xmath15 , the slope of the differential directed flow and the magnitude of the differential elliptic flow are also reduced by approximately a factor of five and two , respectively .",
    "it thus confirms that the spin - related mean - field potentials induced by the nuclear spin - dependent interaction are responsible for the spin dynamics of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "both the spin up - down differential directed flow and elliptic flow are sensitive probes of the in - medium nuclear spin - orbit interaction and the dynamics of spin transport in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the present model can also be used to study spin - relevant observables of light clusters in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions . how to treat consistently the formation and dissociation of clusters especially the heavy ones dynamically in transport model simulations",
    "is still a challenging question .",
    "the phase - space coalescence model  @xcite is widely used as an afterburner of transport simulations to model cluster formation at the freeze - out stage of the reaction .",
    "the deexcitations of large and hot clusters is generally described by various statistical sequential decays or simultaneous multifragmentation models , such as the gemini model  @xcite or the statistical multifragmentation model  @xcite ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these hybrid models have been shown to be effective and reasonable in describing observables of light clusters , such as their multiplicities  @xcite and collective flows  @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we adopt a dynamical coalescence model which evaluates the probability of producing a cluster by the overlap of its wigner phase - space density with daughter nucleons  @xcite .",
    "this model is specially useful for studying light clusters which are loosely bound .    in previous studies",
    ", only a spin - independent wigner function is used to calculate the wigner phase - space density  @xcite by using a statistical factor @xmath76 to take into account the spin - isospin degeneracy of light clusters .",
    "for example , the spin degeneracy factor for a proton and a neutron to form a deuteron is @xmath77 . in our current model",
    "we can improve the dynamical coalescence with the explicit knowledge of the nucleon spin and isospin .",
    "the total wave function of light clusters is the direct product of spin , isospin , and coordinate space wave functions , and it must satisfy the antisymmetrization condition as a fermion system . if we assume that light clusters are in their ground states ( @xmath78-wave with zero total angular momentum )  , the product of spin and isospin wave function should be asymmetric .",

    "taking @xmath83 nuclei as an example , there are totally @xmath84 combinations for two protons and one neutron . considering the antisymmetrization of the wave function and the values of its spin and isospin",
    ", we finally find two wave functions satisfying all the conditions , i.e. , @xmath85 thus , the statistical factor is @xmath86 without knowing the information of nucleon spin .",

    "this is understandable since deuteron is a spin-1 particle and a deuteron with @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) is formed by a neutron and a proton with both @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , while a spin - up ( spin - down ) triton or @xmath83 nucleus is formed by two spin - up ( spin - down ) nucleons and one spin - down ( spin - up ) one .",

    "the nuclear spin - orbit coupling plays the similar role of an external magnetic field as that in the stern - gerlach experiments . in this sense , the present method describes properly the correlation between the spin and trajectory , while the previous method takes the nucleon spin evolution in the mean field into consideration .",

    "<S> the spin up - down splitting of collective flows in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions as a result of the nuclear spin - orbit interaction is investigated within a spin- and isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehing - uhlenbeck transport model sibuu12 . using a skyrme - type spin - orbit coupling quadratic in momentum </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the spin splittings of the directed flow and elliptic flow are largest in peripheral au+au collisions at beam energies of about 100 - 200 mev / nucleon , and the effect is considerable even in smaller systems especially for nucleons with high transverse momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the collective flows of light clusters of different spin states are also investigated using an improved dynamical coalescence model with spin . </S>",
    "<S> our study can be important in understanding the properties of in - medium nuclear spin - orbit interactions once the spin - dependent observables proposed in this work can be measured . </S>"
