    "the field of opinion dynamics is concerned with how human agents influence one another in forming opinions , say on social and political issues ( though in principle on anything ) .",
    "mathematical modelling in this area has increased rapidly in recent years , as technology has improved the prospects for running computer simulations .",
    "rigorous results remain rare , however , and mainly confined to the simplest properties of the simplest models .",
    "one such simple model which has proven immensely popular is the so - called _ hegselmann - krause bounded confidence model _",
    "( hk - model for brevity ) .",
    "it was introduced in @xcite , though the paper usually cited is @xcite , which at the time of writing has 935 citations on google scholar , mostly from non - mathematicians .",
    "the model works as follows .",
    "we have a finite number @xmath1 of agents , indexed by the integers @xmath6 .",
    "time is measured discretely and the opinion of agent @xmath7 at time @xmath8 is represented by a real number @xmath9 .",
    "there is a fixed parameter @xmath10 such that the dynamics are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "thus each agent is only willing to compromise at any time with those whose opinions lie within his so - called _ confidence interval _ , and he updates to the average of these opinions , including his own .",
    "moreover , the width of this interval , @xmath13 , is the same for all agents .",
    "since the dynamics are obviously unaffected by rescaling all opinions and the confidence bound @xmath14 by a common factor , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath15 .",
    "two important qualitative features of the hk - model are that agents act synchronously and in a completely deterministic manner .",
    "this is in contrast to some other famous opinion dynamics models such as voter modelsmodel ] or the deffuant - weisbuch model @xcite .",
    "its popularity is probably due to the simplicity of its formulation , which nevertheless seems `` natural '' .",
    "mathematically , it is very tantalising .",
    "the update rule ( [ eq : update ] ) is linear , but clearly the transition matrix is in general time - dependent , which is the key point .",
    "the hk - model has many elegant features which are still either partly understood or have only been observed in simulations . for a more comprehensive survey of the theoretical challenges , see for example the introduction to @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on one particular question which has been the subject of much attention , namely how long it takes for opinions obeying the hk - dynamics to stabilise .",
    "first , some notation and terminology .",
    "let @xmath16 be a configuration of opinions .",
    "we say that agents @xmath7 and @xmath17 _ agree _ if @xmath18 . a maximal set of agents that agree",
    "is called a _ cluster _ , and the number of agents in a cluster is called its _",
    "size_. the configuration is said to be _ _ frozen _ _ if @xmath19 whenever @xmath20 . clearly , if the configuration is frozen then @xmath21 for all @xmath7 , and it is easy to see that the converse also holds .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental result about the hk - dynamics is that any configuration of opinions will freeze in a finite number of time steps , which moreover is universally bounded by a function of the number @xmath1 of agents only .",
    "indeed , the same is true of a wide class of models including hk as a simple prototype , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the maximum number of time steps taken to freeze by a configuration of @xmath1 agents obeying ( [ eq : update ] ) . for the hk - model ,",
    "the bound given in @xcite is @xmath23 .",
    "however , it is known that @xmath22 is bounded by a polynomial function of @xmath1 .",
    "the first such bound of @xmath24 was established in @xcite and the current record is @xmath25 , due to @xcite .",
    "lower bounds for @xmath22 have received less attention , perhaps due to the difficulty in finding explicit examples of configurations which take a long time to freeze . a natural example to look at",
    "is the configuration @xmath26 , in which opinions are equally spaced with gaps equal to the confidence bound .",
    "thus , agents are placed as far apart as possible to begin with , without being split into two isolated groups .",
    "it is not hard to see that , as this configuration updates , if @xmath27 then the opinions of agents @xmath7 and @xmath28 will remain constant as long as @xmath29 , while both will change at @xmath30 . hence , the time taken for the configuration @xmath31 to freeze is at least @xmath32 . in fact",
    ", this configuration freezes in time @xmath33 , see @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath34 , an observation that was already made in @xcite . in this paper , we will prove that @xmath4 by exhibiting an explicit sequence @xmath35 of configurations which take this long to freeze .",
    "in fact , we shall abuse notation slightly . though we could define a suitable configuration for any number @xmath1 of agents , in order to simplify the appearance of certain formulas",
    "we will assume that @xmath1 is even and let @xmath35 denote a certain configuration on @xmath36 agents .",
    "our construction basically combines the chain @xmath31 with an example of kurz @xcite , and is defined as follows :    [ def : config ] let @xmath1 be a positive , even integer .",
    "the configuration @xmath35 consists of @xmath37 agents whose opinions are given by @xmath38    the configuration is represented pictorially in figure [ fig : dumbbell ] .",
    "[ fig : dumbbell ]    it has the shape of a dumbbell .",
    "indeed , someone familiar with the theory of markov chains might consider this a natural candidate for maximising the freezing time .",
    "there is a subtlety , however .",
    "along the `` bar '' of the dumbbell , opinions are equally spaced at distance one , whereas the two dumbbell clusters themselves are positioned much closer , at distance @xmath39 , to the ends of the bar .",
    "the latter is what raises the freezing time from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , as will become evident from the proof below .",
    "in fact , this is just one of at least three ways of considering our construction as a modification of others previously known which all freeze in linear time .",
    "a second way would be to think of it as starting from @xmath31 , which freezes in time @xmath42 , and then adding the dumbbells .",
    "a third would be to start from the configuration in @xcite , which consists of the two dumbbells placed at distance @xmath39 from their respective solitary agents , but then without the long intermediate chain .",
    "kurz showed that his configuration took time @xmath43 to freeze and as a by - product of our method , it can be easily shown to freeze in time @xmath42 .",
    "let us now formally state our result .",
    "[ thm : main ] the configuration @xmath35 freezes after time @xmath44 .    the proof will be given in the next section . one important feature of our result is that it matches the best - known lower bound for the freezing time of the multi - dimensional hk - model .",
    "the latter refers to the fact that rule ( [ eq : update ] ) makes sense if opinions @xmath45 are considered as vectors in @xmath46 for any fixed @xmath2 and neighborhoods @xmath47 are defined with respect to euclidean distance .",
    "the sociological interpretation would be that there are @xmath2 `` issues '' , and that agents will compromise if and only if their opinions are sufficiently close on _ all _ issues .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the maximum number of time steps taken to freeze by a configuration of @xmath1 agents with opinions in @xmath46 and obeying ( [ eq : update ] ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0 is bounded by a universal polynomial function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this was also established in @xcite , who gave the bound @xmath48 .",
    "note , though , that this is much worse than the best bound @xmath25 in one dimension .",
    "indeed , the proof of the latter in @xcite uses a different argument which does not seem to generalise to higher dimensions , consider three agents @xmath49 initially placed at @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively . at @xmath52 , only @xmath53 and @xmath54 will interact , but this first interaction will bring them both to @xmath55 where they are close enough to @xmath56 to interact at @xmath57 . ] .    already in two dimensions ,",
    "however , a quadratic lower bound was also proven in @xcite .",
    "their example , which we denote @xmath58 , places the @xmath1 agents at the vertices of a regular @xmath1-gon of side - length one , and they show that the system requires at least @xmath59 steps to freeze .",
    "the configuration @xmath58 seems , at least in hindsight , like a natural `` two - dimensional version '' of @xmath31 .",
    "it is not really clear how far one can push this idea , however , as the upper bound of @xmath60 for all dimensions makes immediately clear . indeed , there is no example known in dimensions @xmath61 which takes longer to freeze than @xmath58 , now considered as a configuration on a plane in @xmath46 .",
    "the configurations @xmath35 discussed in this paper are also quite different from the @xmath58 .",
    "+    we finish this section by giving some more fairly standard terminology to be used below .",
    "let @xmath16 be a configuration of one - dimensional opinions , obeying the convention that @xmath62 whenever @xmath63 .",
    "we can define a _",
    "receptivity graph _ @xmath64 , whose nodes are the @xmath1 agents and where an edge is placed between agents @xmath7 and @xmath17 whenever @xmath65 .",
    "we say that agents @xmath7 and @xmath17 are _ connected _ if they are in the same connected component of the receptivity graph .",
    "observe that every connected component of @xmath64 is an interval of agents and that @xmath7 is disconnected from @xmath66 if and only if @xmath67 .",
    "[ lem : walk ] let @xmath68 and let @xmath69 denote the path on @xmath1 vertices , indexed from left - to - right by the integers @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath71 be a random walk on @xmath69 with transition probabilities @xmath72 given by @xmath73 for any @xmath74 and @xmath75 , let @xmath76 denote the expected number of times a walk started at @xmath7 will hit @xmath17 up to and including time @xmath77 , i.e. : @xmath78.\\ ] ] then @xmath79 for all @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is an absolute constant , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this result surely follows from standard textbook facts about random walks on graphs , but since we can not point to a reference for the precise result , we shall outline a proof in any case .",
    "let us consider instead a cycle @xmath82 of length @xmath83 , with vertices indexed clockwise by @xmath84 , and a random walk on the cycle for which the transition probabilities are @xmath85 if @xmath86 and @xmath87 otherwise .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the expected number of times a walk on @xmath82 started at node @xmath7 hits node @xmath17 up to and including time @xmath77 .",
    "+   + claim 1 : ( i ) @xmath89 .",
    "+ ( ii ) @xmath90 .",
    "+   + to prove ( i ) first note that , by the symmetry of the transition rules on the cycle , the function @xmath91 is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath92 be the random time at which a walk started at @xmath93 first hits @xmath83 .",
    "then @xmath94 where we have used the obvious fact that the functions @xmath88 are all non - decreasing in @xmath77 .    the right - hand inequality in ( ii ) follows from ( i ) . for the left - hand equality ,",
    "we identify the nodes of @xmath82 in pairs as @xmath95 a random walk on @xmath82 can be identified with a random walk on the path @xmath69 whose vertices from left - to - right are @xmath96 , where any step in the former which remains inside the same subset @xmath97 is considered as standing still at the same vertex in the latter .",
    "it is also easy to see that if the transition probabilities on the cycle are @xmath98 , then on the path they become @xmath99 .",
    "the equality in ( ii ) follows immediately from these observations .",
    "+    by claim 1 , it suffices to prove that @xmath100 for all @xmath80 .",
    "we go one step further .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the probability that the walk on @xmath82 , started at node @xmath93 , is also at node @xmath93 at time @xmath77 .",
    "by linearity of expectation , it suffices to prove that @xmath102 for all @xmath80 .",
    "so fix a time @xmath103 .",
    "any walk consists of steps of three types : clockwise , anticlockwise and standing still .",
    "the walk will be back at node @xmath93 at time @xmath77 if and only if the numbers of clockwise and anticlockwise steps among the first @xmath77 steps are congruent modulo @xmath83 .",
    "the expected number of standing still steps is @xmath104 and , up to an error of order @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is an absolute constant , we can ignore all walks where the number of standing still steps is greater than @xmath107 say .",
    "conditioned on the number @xmath108 of such steps and their timings , there are @xmath109 possible walks .",
    "the number of these which have @xmath56 clockwise steps is @xmath110 , which is less than @xmath111 for any @xmath56 and maximised at @xmath112 .",
    "since we re assuming @xmath113 , it follows that every binomial coefficient is less than @xmath114 . the ones that contribute to @xmath101 are those such that @xmath115 .",
    "the gap between any two such values of @xmath56 is at least @xmath1 which , since @xmath116 , is at least @xmath117 .",
    "+   + claim 2 : there is a real number @xmath118 such that , for all integers @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath121 once again , we will prove this directly , rather than appealing to some textbook fact . for @xmath122 , let @xmath123 .",

    "this proves claim 2 .",
    "+    claim 2 implies that , conditioned on @xmath108 , the contributions to @xmath101 from different values of @xmath56 decrease exponentially as one moves away from @xmath132 , and hence the total contribution is bounded by an absolute constant times the largest one which , as previously stated , is at most @xmath133 . unwinding our argument",
    ", what we have shown is that , provided @xmath80 and conditioning on the number and timing of all standing still steps up to time @xmath77 , the probability of the walk being back at node @xmath93 is @xmath134 .",
    "hence , @xmath102 , as desired .",
    "[ lem : recurrence ] let @xmath135 , @xmath136 and , for @xmath75 , let @xmath137 be a sequence of vectors in @xmath138 defined recursively as follows : @xmath139 then there is an absolute constant @xmath140 such that @xmath141 for all @xmath7 and all @xmath116 .    for any @xmath77 ,",

    "it thus suffices to prove that @xmath144 for all @xmath116 .",
    "the recursion can be written in matrix form as @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 is the transition matrix of ( [ eq : transition ] ) .",

    "in particular , agent @xmath178 will not be visible to the cluster on the left before time @xmath179 , which proves that the configuration will take at least this long to freeze .",
    "one can prove that the configuration does indeed freeze in time @xmath41 .",
    "first , we can turn the above argument around somewhat and deduce instead from the above relations that @xmath180 for all @xmath148 and hence , instead of ( [ eq : recurdeltaone ] ) , that @xmath181 the argument in lemma [ lem : recurrence ] can then be turned on its head to deduce that @xmath182 , while it is almost trivial that @xmath183 .",
    "what all of this implies is that agent @xmath178 will indeed become visible to the cluster on the left at time @xmath184 , and it will then immediately disconnect from agent @xmath185 .",
    "we then just need to consider the subsequent evolution of the chain @xmath186 of agents @xmath187 .",
    "since @xmath188 for every @xmath7 , it follows from ( [ eq : ydeltazero ] ) and ( [ eq : ydeltarest ] ) that the gaps between consecutive agents in @xmath186 are all greater than @xmath189 .",
    "hence the chain will freeze in time @xmath33 .",
    "this last deduction follows from unpublished results in @xcite , more precisely from theorem 1.1 and remarks at the outset of section 3 in that paper .",
    "given that the configuration @xmath35 freezes in time @xmath41 , one can try to compute the constant factor accurately .",
    "we have not done so , but a combination of simulations and the ockham s razor principle lead us to believe that the freezing time for @xmath35 is @xmath190 .",
    "the factor of @xmath191 comes from the fact that the numbers @xmath192 in ( [ eq : ydeltarest ] ) seem to grow like @xmath193 .",
    "note that , if our hypothesis is correct , then the freezing time of the configuration @xmath35 still grows more slowly , at least for @xmath194 , than that of the two - dimensional configuration @xmath195 .",
    "these are also two quite different types of configurations .",
    "it remains unclear what the right estimate for the function @xmath0 might be in higher dimensions .",
