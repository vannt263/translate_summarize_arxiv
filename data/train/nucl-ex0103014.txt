    "recent studies of particle  -  @xmath0 coincidences using large @xmath0-ray detector arrays in conjunction with 4@xmath10 solid state particle - detector balls have shown that the particle trigger can be a decisive tool in identifying the final nucleus for a detailed nuclear spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the enhanced emission of charged particles from the compound nucleus ( cn ) has also been discussed as a possible trigger for more strongly deformed shapes of the compound nucleus @xcite . for lighter cn ,",
    "in particular for n = z @xmath1-cluster nuclei , the emission of heavier fragments has been observed , and the process of the emission of @xmath2be and @xmath11c nuclei is expected to be strongly enhanced if the cn is well deformed @xcite .",
    "the emission of these `` light '' fragments ( also called intermediate mass fragments ) is actually viewed in close relation to asymmetric fission , which may proceed through strongly deformed shapes @xcite .",
    "we have started a study of the population of highly deformed bands in @xmath1-cluster nuclei by using binary reaction triggers  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen reactions between light @xmath1-cluster nuclei populating cn in the a=40 - 56 range , for which very deformed shapes are predicted @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report results on the emission of @xmath2be in the @xmath3s  +  @xmath4 mg reaction , which can be viewed as a binary process , at @xmath12 , the @xmath13ni cn being populated at an excitation energy of e@xmath14 = 70  mev .",
    "the @xmath13ni nucleus is of special interest in the sense that it can be populated by the mass - symmetric reaction @xmath15si+@xmath15si , which is known to be one of the most favorable nuclear systems for the observation of resonant behavior  @xcite .",
    "futhermore , the @xmath15si+@xmath15si scattering has revealed triaxial quasi - molecular states  @xcite populated by the conjectured @xmath16 resonance  @xcite .",
    "the symmetric and near - symmetric fission processes induced by the @xmath3s  +  @xmath4 mg reaction have been already studied extensively in the recent past @xcite .",
    "previous @xmath0-ray spectroscopy studies of this reaction , using the @xmath0-spectrometer gasp ( with an photopeak efficiency @xmath17 ) with the light - charged - particle ball isis , have furnished detailed information on the structure of @xmath7cr and other neighbouring nuclei , which were selected by gating on @xmath1-particles and protons @xcite .",
    "we have used the same original data @xcite to search for @xmath0-coincidences with @xmath2be .",
    "the @xmath2be nucleus is identified by selecting the corresponding events ( as explained in sect .",
    "[ sect : exp_proc ] ) from the @xmath6e - e matrix shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dee ] .    e - e signals from the isis telescopes as obtained from the experiment with @xmath3s  +  @xmath4 mg at e@xmath18 = 130  mev . events for the hydrogen isotopes p , d and t as well as for @xmath1-particles can be identified .",
    "the @xmath2be events are seen at twice the amplitudes of the @xmath1-particles .",
    "the inlet shows the breakup of @xmath19 into 2  @xmath1-particles and their detection in the same detector ( see text ) . ]",
    "the decay of @xmath2be in its ground state , which is unbound by 0.0919  mev , gives rise to 2  @xmath1-particles emitted in the laboratory system in a narrow cone of less than 5 - 7  degrees , which are registered simultaneously in one of the 40  @xmath6e - e telescopes of the isis multidetector array .",
    "the telescopes have an angular opening of @xmath20 , each with an insensitive gap of 6 - 7  degrees between two single detectors due to the width of the detector frames and cover 64% of @xmath21 , whereas for the beam entrance and exit each one detector telescope has been taken out leading to an angular range from @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath2be events are thus easily registered as `` pile up '' events of 2  @xmath1-particles .",
    "the li - isotopes could not be detected due to absorbers ( @xmath23 al foil ) placed in front of the isis detectors , which modify also the @xmath6e - e curves of the detected particles .",
    "the detection efficiency for @xmath1-particles at the forward rings , which carries almost all of the statistics , is not affected by this absorbers .",
    "the first excited state of @xmath2be at an excitation energy of 3.04  mev , having a width of 1.5  mev , will produce an emission cone of more than 30  degrees .",
    "this means that only a small fraction of the @xmath24-pairs are registered in one isis telescope ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "a possibility to select such events is the selection of two  @xmath1-particles in two adjacent telescopes , a procedure , which has also been pursued .",
    "these events show no difference in the @xmath0-spectrum to the randomly distributed @xmath1-particle triggers , in contrast to those obtained with @xmath26be - trigger as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : single_gamma ] .",
    "however , due to the high fraction of chance coincidences in the case of using two adjacent telescopes ( see discussion below ) , it is necessary to ask e.g. for the sum of the kinetic energies of both registered @xmath1-particles in order to reduce the background of chance coincidences , but the two - dimensional ( @xmath27 ) distribution shows no distinct structure for @xmath26be@xmath28 or @xmath26be@xmath29 states , and the energy resolution of the detectors ( due to the large opening angle of the single telescopes , resulting in the coverage of a wide range of angles and @xmath1-energies ) did not allow to make a selection of @xmath26be states .",
    "therefore these events of 2  @xmath1-particles in two adjacent detectors were not included in the data analysis . in the later analysis of",
    "the @xmath0-spectra triggered with @xmath26be a @xmath26be@xmath29 contribution can not be excluded , but it is not considered in the compound nucleus calculations in sect .",
    "[ sect : ehfm ] .",
    "an important aspect of the identification of @xmath26be is the determination of the background of chance coincidences resulting from 2  @xmath1-particles recorded in the same event in one of the n=40 isis telescopes in the @xmath6e - e branch for @xmath26be .",
    "these 2  @xmath1-particles can either be emitted , ( i ) from the same event or , ( ii ) if emitted from two subsequent different events each emitting one @xmath1-particle , they must fall into the rise time of the electronics of the detection system of @xmath30 ( `` pile up '' events ) .",
    "the rate of chance coincidences of the latter type can be estimated by the expression @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the total rate for detection of single @xmath1-particle . from the total isis rates @xmath33 ( counts / sec ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( integrated over all n=40 telescopes ) we obtain the small average background value @xmath36 , where @xmath37 was not corrected for the background events included .",
    "for the most forward isis telescope ring , showing the highest counting rate ( 96% for the @xmath24 case ) , the @xmath1 and @xmath26be rates and the background percentage can be given as a average value for a single detector by @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the chance coincidence background due to two sequentially emitted @xmath1-particles from the same event hitting the same detector can be estimated from the multiplicity distribution , the solid angle @xmath41 , and the efficiency @xmath42 of the individual telescopes .",
    "we choose the experimentally observed @xmath43 coincidences in two different telescopes as a reference point , which fixes the multiplicity of the events to @xmath44 , with some very small contributions from higher multiplicities .",
    "the original average multiplicity is close to @xmath45 . as a first estimate we assume isotropic emission of both @xmath1-particles in the laboratory frame ( thus neglecting e.g. kinematics ) .",
    "the total rate to observe a second @xmath1 in coincidence with the first is given by the half of the total matrix of @xmath46 combinations minus the diagonal part , which corresponds to the background in the true @xmath26be events ( @xmath47 is the number of telescopes ) .",
    "this part of the matrix has @xmath48 elements ; the corresponding total number of events measured in the experiment is @xmath49 ( @xmath24 ) coincidences in 30.7  hours .",
    "the total background consisting of 40 diagonal elements ( counters ) in the matrix is determined by the ratio 40/780 and must be scaled with the number of all observed @xmath50 counts for @xmath26be .",
    "we thus obtain a value of 14 % of @xmath24 coincidences as background , a result , which is independent of the total efficiency to observe one @xmath1-particle .",
    "however , due to the kinematically inverted reaction , @xmath3s  @xmath51  @xmath4 mg , and due to the low energies in the center of mass system of the @xmath1-emitting nuclei , @xmath1-particle emission is strongly focused into the forward direction by kinematics . another effect to be considered is the fact that for isotropic emission of the first @xmath1-particle in the c.m .",
    "system , the emission of the second @xmath1-particle is expected to be to some degree correlated in the plane of the emission of the first @xmath1-particle . this is reflected in the observation that @xmath24 coincidences are stronger in telescopes with opposite directions to the beam for the most forward isis ring , enhanced by kinematical focusing towards @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the enhanced counting rates at @xmath52 and @xmath53 could not be analyzed quantitatively , because of the beam exit hole in the isis ball and due to the low energies of the backwards emitted @xmath1-particles in the laboratory system , which fall below the detection threshold .",
    "we observe 96% of the hits within the first ring of isis telescopes and 30% of the second @xmath1-particles are detected by isis telescopes on the opposite side in the ball within the same ring . from this fact the chance coincidence rate of 2  @xmath1-particles in one detector given above with 14%",
    "is estimated to be reduced by a factor of @xmath54 .",
    "this factor results from the comparison of the theoretically estimated probability within the first ring of 6  detectors with a fixed detector for the first @xmath1 , to find the second @xmath1 in the same detector , and the measured value for the probability to find the second @xmath1 in the neighbouring detector .",
    "the latter should be very close to the probability to find it in the same detector ( which is not directly measurable ) .",
    "the most intense @xmath43 coincidence rate for a given detector has been found not in the neighboring detector , but in the opposite side ( reduction by typically a factor  2 ) .",
    "the resulting value of 7% of the chance coincidence contribution of 2  @xmath1-particles in one detector is close to the measured value of finding the second @xmath1 in other neighbouring detectors using the data of all adjacent detectors ( i.e. also of the second ring ) , which is found to be 6%",

    "it can be observed that for the maximum spin values for the formation of the @xmath13ni cn , @xmath133 , adopted from ref.@xcite ( consistent with the available measured complete fusion cross sections  @xcite ) , the @xmath26be emission is not favoured relative to the @xmath24 emission for more deformed states ( at @xmath134 ) .",

    "actually @xmath26be carries more angular momentum and fig .",
    "[ fig : ehf]a shows that its emission will be favored at higher angular momenta ( @xmath135 ) for larger deformations , as also predicted in ref .",
    "it is interesting to note that the limiting angular momentum for @xmath13ni is experimentally found to be close to 42@xmath70  @xcite in agreement with the predictions of a modified version of the rotating liquid drop model ( ldm ) , which includes finite - range corrections of the nuclear interaction by means of a yukawa - plus - exponential attractive potential and diffuse - surface effects  @xcite .",
    "we consider in addition then a second effect , which is also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the increased phase space for the more strongly deformed daughter nuclei , i.e. for a softer yrast line due to a larger moment of inertia . in the present formulation",
    "this can be achieved by an increase of the radius parameter @xmath121 of the heavy fragment @xmath103 .",
    "the result for different values of @xmath121 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ehf]b , again as function of @xmath104 , the neck parameter .",
    "the figure shows appreciable effects for changes of @xmath121 .",
    "we can read from this graphs also the effect produced by the larger moment of inertia alone by choosing @xmath136 .",
    "thus the constant values of @xmath101 for ( @xmath137 ) , for ( @xmath138 ) and for ( @xmath139 ) must be considered ( they are marked as square symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : ehf]b ) and we deduce an enhancement of the @xmath140 ratio by a factor @xmath141 for an increase of @xmath142 by the factor @xmath143 , which implies that for the present situation an increase of the moment of inertia of 10% of the daughter nucleus is reflected in a noticeable enhancement of the @xmath26be yield by a factor 1.7 . from these calculations we conclude that the changed ratio of the emission of @xmath2be relative to that of two consecutive @xmath1-particles can be related to an increase of the deformation parameter @xmath144 of the heavier fragment , for which a discussion is given in the following section .",
    "the structure of the @xmath7cr nucleus is described quite well by the consideration of the half filled f@xmath69 shell , which allows various nucleon excitations into higher orbitals .",
    "the ground state band is suggested to have a deformation of @xmath145  @xcite near the ground state and the deformation parameter reaches @xmath146 , as the band termination at @xmath147 is approached .",
    "this decrease is explained by the fact that because of the relatively small number of nucleons in the 1f@xmath69 shell , it is not possible to obtain collectivity at high spins . in the case of the negative parity band , collectivity remains stronger also at higher spins due to the mixing with the g@xmath76 shell .",
    "even though the deformation at low spins is almost equal for the gs - band and the side band , the deformation at higher spins is larger for the side band .",
    "this is the crucial point when comparing the feeding into @xmath7cr , because it occurs not nearby the ground state but at higher spins .    .",
    "note the small distance of the @xmath74k=7/2 ^ -$ ] and the @xmath75k=1/2^+$ ] orbitals as the deformation parameter @xmath144 ( @xmath148 ) tends to 0.35 , and the rising energy of the @xmath72k=3/2 ^ -$ ] orbit approaching the f@xmath69 shell , which is only half filled for @xmath7cr . ]",
    "the result of the enhanced @xmath0-ray yields for the @xmath2be trigger for the side - band with negative parity ( @xmath64 ) can be related to higher deformations at high spins for this band .",
    "particle - hole excitations from the d@xmath149 to the f@xmath69 orbit and also into the g@xmath76 orbit of the next shell will be favored for larger deformations and higher spins . with these configurations",
    "a band head of @xmath64 is obtained .",
    "other side - bands with positive parity can be expected for the 2-particle2-hole excitations to the [ 310]1/2 nilsson orbital , which gives a band head with @xmath150 , but higher excitation energy than for @xmath64 .",
    "these features can be read qualitatively from the nilsson diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : nilsson ] .",
    "the experimental observation of an enhanced emission of @xmath2be into a more deformed side - band in @xmath7cr has been observed by the use of particle  -  @xmath0 coincidences using a large @xmath0-ray detector array . using the _ extended - hauser - feshbach method _ ( ehfm )",
    "it has been shown that cluster emission will be enhanced at high angular momenta for the decay into deformed residual nuclei .",
    "the result is related to previous theoretical and experimental studies of cluster emission from compound nuclei . in the work of blann and komoto  @xcite on cluster emission amplification , actually",
    "the case of the compound nucleus @xmath13ni at an excitation energy of 94  mev , somewhat higher than ours ( 70  mev ) , has been treated . in their work deformation",
    "is introduced at various stages of the decay ( mainly at the same places as in the present work ) , and the emission of clusters up to the mass @xmath11c is considered .",
    "they find that the fractional decay probability for @xmath1-particles varies only moderately with the introduction of deformation ( at the maximum spin values of @xmath151 ) ; at these angular momenta an increase of the emission probability for @xmath2be and @xmath11c by factors @xmath152 is observed if the proper deformation values from ldm are introduced .",
    "the comparison of our result with ref .",
    "@xcite has to be seen with the constraint that in the previous work finite - range corrections , which produce for each angular momentum a lowering of the fission barrier due to the attractive forces between surfaces of the two nascent fragments at the saddle point  @xcite , have not been taken into account .",
    "we can state that the present result and their work  @xcite are in agreement with the observation that the emission of heavier fragments at higher angular momenta is enhanced from and to deformed configurations .",
    "our calculations have shown that this phenomenon depends on the maximum spin in the primary population , an effect which is also documented in  @xcite .    the main origin of the enhancement in the population of more deformed shapes after the emission of @xmath26be and @xmath11c might be linked to structural effects @xcite , like specific population of the states close to the yrast line .",
    "this feature will be pursued in a future investigation , where the population of large deformations of fragments from a binary process will be searched for in particle  -  @xmath0 coincidences with euroball  @xcite and at higher incident energies .",
