    "since the early days of quantum theory it was realized that quantum systems can possess correlations that do not have a classical counterpart schroedinger , epr , bell . for a long time",
    "this phenomenon , called entanglement , has been of interest mostly in the context of foundations of quantum mechanics . with the advent of quantum information science nielsen - chuang",
    "it has been realized that entanglement is an essential resource for efficient computation and communication .",
    "this initiated a more systematic study of its properties .",
    "while entanglement in small systems is by now well understood , many particle entanglement is still a widely open field .",
    "it is well known that quantum correlations and entanglement naturally occur in interacting many - particle systems but we only begin to understand their role in the systems @xcite .",
    "recently the entanglement properties of quantum systems near the critical points of quantum phase transitions @xcite have attracted much attention .",
    "two - particle entanglement has been studied in terms of the concurrence @xcite e.g. in one dimensional spin chains oconnor2001,arnesen2001,osborne2002,osterloh2002,vidal2003 .",
    "the concurrence contains however only limited information about the global distribution of entanglement , and other measures such as the bi - partite entanglement between blocks of spins may be of larger interest .",
    "bi - partite entanglement has been analyzed e.g. in one dimensional quantum spin chains in @xcite , where it was shown that it scales logarithmically with the system size at the critical point with a prefactor determined by the universality class and saturates in the noncritical regime .",
    "we here study the bi - partite entanglement in a system of spins with a collective coupling described by a generalization of the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) hamiltonian @xcite . since this hamiltonian is symmetric under the exchange of particles the hilbert space separates into subspaces whose dimensions grow only linearly with the number of particles , which makes them numerically accessible .",
    "in particular we consider the case of an _ even _ number of spins and an _ anti - ferromagnetic _ coupling .",
    "furthermore we concentrate on the case where the hamiltonian can be factorized in a product of two terms each being linear in the total spin operators . under these conditions , which includes the special case of a super - symmetry ( susy ) @xcite , cooper1995 ,",
    "the ground state can be constructed explicitly unanyan2003 .",
    "this ground state undergoes a smooth transition from a separable to a maximally entangled state as a function of a parameter @xmath1 , which characterizes the asymmetry between the collective spin coupling in @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions .",
    "the two - particle concurrence in this system , which due to symmetry is the same for all pair of spins , has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "very recently also bi - partite entanglement has been studied in @xcite and @xcite , however for the _ ferromagnetic _ version of the lmg model , where there is a quantum phase transition .",
    "although in the anti - ferromagnetic case , considered here , there is no quantum phase transition , we find a discontinuuous behavior of the entanglement when @xmath1 is changed .    after discussing the lmg model and its ground state under the condition of super - symmetry in sec.ii ,",
    "we analyze the bi - partite entanglement of this state in terms of the von neumann entropy @xcite in sec.iii .",
    "we show that for an isotropic interaction ( @xmath3 ) and in the thermodynamic limit the entropy grows logarithmically with the spin of the subsystem with no upper bound . on the other hand for any non vanishing",
    "@xmath1 the entropy has an upper limit determined solely by @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore it becomes a function of the ratio of the subsystem spin to the total spin rather than a function of the subsystem spin alone . in a finite system",
    "the transition between isotropic and anisotropic behavior occurs at @xmath9 . to understand the saturation of the entanglement quantitatively , we give in sec .",
    "iv an analytic estimate for the global entanglement by determining the geometric measure of entanglement .",
    "let us consider an even number @xmath0 of spin 1/2 particles interacting through a nonlinear coupling of the collective spin @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the @xmath12 s component of the single - particle spin .",
    "the interaction is assumed to be of second order in the total spin and is thus a generalization of the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) hamiltonian @xcite @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive real numbers and thus the coupling is of the anti - ferromagnetic type .",
    "@xmath16 commutes with the total spin @xmath17 and thus the total hilbert space separates in sub spaces determined by the spin quantum number @xmath18 .",
    "we here restrict ourselves to the case of maximum spin , i.e. @xmath5 . as has been shown in @xcite , ( hamiltonian ) can be written as a product of two terms linear in the collective spin operators if @xmath19 : @xmath20@xmath21 is positive definite , and if @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , @xmath5 being the total angular momentum , it possesses a non degenerate ground state with @xmath24 obeying @xmath25since this equation is linear the ground state can be easily constructed , which yields @xmath26|m_{y}=m\\rangle   \\label{psi0}\\]]where we have introduced the real anisotropy parameter @xmath1 through @xmath27 .",
    "it is interesting to note that an anisotropy in the spin coupling is reflected here in the non - unitary term @xmath28 . in the fully isotropic limit @xmath3 ,",
    "the ground state is the state @xmath29 which is entangled for all @xmath30 . in the maximally anisotropic case @xmath2",
    ", the ground state is @xmath31 , which is a product state .",
    "the loss of entanglement in this case is due to the non - unitary term @xmath32 .",
    "changing @xmath1 , e.g. as function of time , from @xmath33 to @xmath34 causes a smooth transition from a factorized to an entangled many - body state .    due to the symmetry of the coupling all matrix elements of the hamiltonian between states corresponding to different total spin @xmath18",
    "vanish exactly even for time - dependent parameter . thus even though the ground state of ( hamiltonian ) becomes degenerate for @xmath35 with respect to the total spin @xmath18 @xcite ,",
    "the system can not undergo a first order quantum phase transition upon changing @xmath36 .",
    "in fact the degeneracy in @xmath18 at @xmath35 can easily be lifted by adding a term @xmath37 to ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , which has no effect on @xmath38 .    in the following we will restrict ourselves to the most interesting special case @xmath39 . as has been shown in @xcite and @xcite the collective state @xmath40 has the largest global entanglement and should thus be considered as the state with maximum @xmath0-particle entanglement .",
    "a generalization to arbitrary @xmath41 values is rather straight forward but less instructive .",
    "an additional feature of the @xmath39 case is the presence of a super - symmetry of the lmg hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "as a consequence in every spin sector @xmath18 the spectrum of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has for all values of @xmath1 a nondegenerate ground state and all excited states are pairwise degenerate @xcite .",
    "as shown in unanyan2003 the energy gap between the ground state and the pair of first excited states does not close .",
    "for @xmath39 the ground state ( [ psi0 ] ) reads explicitly @xmath42 being legendre polynomials .",
    "in the following section we discuss the entanglement between two arbitrary partitions of the @xmath0 particle system in the susy ground state of the lmg model .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction it is not important here how the partitioning is done . due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian",
    "only the number of particles in each partition is of relevance .      a generally accepted quantitative measure for the entanglement between two subsystems @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "if the total system is in a pure state @xmath45 is the von neumann entropy of either of the two subsystems ( entropy of entanglement ) @xmath46where @xmath47 is essentially a measure for the information loss due to division of the system and ignoring one of the subsystems . if there is entanglement between @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the original pure state @xmath48 of the total system , the entropy is nonzero . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath48 factorizes there is no information loss if we ignore one subsystem and the entropy vanishes .",
    "the von neumann entropy for pure states @xmath49 is identical to the minimum relative entropy of entanglement @xmath50 @xcitewith respect to all bi - partite separable states @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53and @xmath54    calculating the von neumann entropy of a many - particle system is in general a very nontrivial task due to the exponential growth of the relevant hilbert space .",
    "we will show now that the von neumann entropy can be related to the variance of the distribution of schmidt coefficients , arranged in an appropriate order , in the limit of a large number of particles .",
    "for the symmetric spin states considered here this variance can easily be calculated , which will be done in the following subsection .",
    "let @xmath55  denote a pure state of a quantum system consisting of two parts labeled @xmath43 and @xmath56 in the case of finite dimensional spaces , schmidt s theorem @xcite asserts that any state @xmath55 in the hilbert space @xmath57 can be written in the form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 being the dimensions of the corresponding hilbert spaces .",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 are sets of orthonormal states for the subsystems @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , and @xmath64 are the positive schmidt coefficients obeying the sum rule @xmath65 it is easy to see that the entropy of entanglement is related to the schmidt coefficients via @xmath66 the schmidt rank , i.e. the number of schmidt coefficients @xmath67 provides a simple upper bound for the entropy of entanglement @xmath68 . if @xmath69 , i.e. if it scales exponentially with the number of particles , @xmath70 is a polynomial function of the number of particles in the smaller of the two subsystems . for the symmetric coupling considered here , the dimension of the relevant hilbert space @xmath71 increases only linear in the number of particles implying a logarithmic scaling of @xmath70 with the system size .",
    "thus also the von neumann entropy @xmath72 is expected to scale logarithmically , however with a yet unknown coefficient . in order to calculate this coefficient",
    "it is obviously not sufficient to use @xmath70 as an estimate for @xmath73 .",
    "it is possible , however , to find a better estimate for @xmath49 in terms of the variance of the distribution of appropriately ordered schmidt coefficients . to show this we first note",
    "that , as shown in @xcite , the following inequality holds @xmath74where @xmath75 is the variance of a probability distribution @xmath76 .",
    "this inequality becomes an equality if @xmath76 is a gaussian function .    for large values of @xmath77",
    "the sum in eq.([entropy1 ] ) can be written as an integral with @xmath78 , representing a continuous , smooth probability distribution .",
    "the functional form of this distribution depends on the ordering of the schmidt coefficients @xmath79 . for symmetric states",
    "this ordering can be chosen in such a way , that @xmath80 becomes to a good approximation a gaussian function @xcite . in this case",
    "the entropy of entanglement is given by @xmath81where @xmath82 is the variance of the schmidt coefficients .",
    "we will now calculate the entropy of entanglement using eq.(entropyequal ) by finding a suitable bipartite decomposition of the ground state ( [ susy - state ] ) .",
    "the scaling of @xmath73 with the system size will be studied in detail and in particular the prefactor of the logarithm determined . in the limit of a totally isotropic spin coupling @xmath35 an explicit analytic expression for the variance of the schmidt coefficients and",
    "the entanglement can be given .",
    "for nonzero values of @xmath36 numerical results will be presented .",
    "we start from equation ( [ susy - state ] ) and make use of the clebsch - gordan decomposition of total angular momentum @xmath5 into @xmath83 and @xmath84 with @xmath85 : @xmath86 here @xmath87 are the clebsch - gordan ( wigner ) coefficients and @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 are the rotation matrices defined as @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 are jacobi polynomials .",
    "since we are considering the special decomposition for @xmath92 , the wigner coefficients have the binomial distribution : @xmath93 this relation combined with ( [ rotmat ] ) gives the following decomposition for the wave function @xmath55 : @xmath94 with @xmath95 ( [ state-2 ] ) is separable if all coefficients @xmath96 factorize .",
    "this is the case in the limit @xmath97 , where the @xmath98 term in ( [ schmidt - final ] ) approaches unity and the jacobi polynomials factorize in @xmath99 and @xmath100 .      making use of the results of subsection a the summation in ( [ psicg ] )",
    "can be carried out explicitly for the limit of isotropic spin coupling . in this case",
    "one sees from ( [ schmidt - final ] ) that only coefficients @xmath102 with @xmath103 survive .",
    "thus one has the following decomposition @xmath104where @xmath105 was assumed without loss of generality .",
    "the schmidt coefficients are , therefore , the clebsch - gordan coefficients . in the limit @xmath106",
    ", they have a gaussian form @xcite @xmath107 } { \\sqrt{j_{1}\\pi } } .\\]]where @xmath108 .",
    "the gaussian form of the coefficients allows to make use of relation ( [ entropyequal ] ) to calculate the von neumann entropy for @xmath109 : @xmath110 in fig.[bipartite - entangle-1 ] we have plotted the von neumann entropy for @xmath3 as a function of the subsystem spin @xmath111 for different values of the total spin @xmath5 . for @xmath109 a logarithmic scaling with prefactor 1/2 is evident .",
    "when @xmath112 approaches @xmath113 the entropy saturates since @xmath72 is symmetric with respect to the replacement @xmath114 .",
    "it is important to note that for @xmath109 the von neumann entropy @xmath72 does not depend on @xmath18 .      if the spin coupling is anisotropic , i.e. if @xmath4 , the double sum in eqs .",
    "( [ psicg ] ) or ( [ state-2 ] ) remains .",
    "thus in order to discuss the influence of a finite @xmath1 it is necessary to explicitly evaluate the sum in ( [ entropy1 ] ) .",
    "we have done this numerically for a total particle number up to 200 and subsystems up to 100 particles .",
    "the results are shown in figs.[bipartite - entangle-2 ] and [ bipartite - entangle-3 ] . as can be seen from fig.[bipartite - entangle-2 ] in contrast to the isotropic case @xmath3 , the entropy is no longer independent on the total spin if @xmath116 in the thermodynamic limit the critical point is @xmath3 .    as can be seen from fig.[bipartite - entangle-3 ] for any @xmath117",
    "the entropy becomes a function of the logarithm of the fraction of particles @xmath118 .",
    "our numerical calculations suggest for @xmath109 and @xmath119 a functional dependence of the form @xmath120    the reduction of entanglement with increasing @xmath1 is expected .",
    "the state @xmath121 is maximally entangled for @xmath3 and the prefactor @xmath122 corresponds to a local non - unitary operation which always decreases the amount of entanglement . for large values of @xmath1 the state",
    "becomes eventually separable .",
    "the most peculiar feature of the von neumann entropy is the change of the scaling behavior with @xmath83 from @xmath123 for @xmath124 to @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "the role of @xmath127 and the change of the scaling behavior is also reflected in the distribution of ordered schmidt numbers .",
    "as can be seen from fig.[bipartite - entangle-4 ] the fall - off of the schmidt numbers @xmath128 becomes exponential when @xmath129 exceeds unity .",
    "there is no obvious distinction of the point @xmath130 in the properties of the system .",
    "the system does not undergo a phase transition at this point .",
    "due to the susy the qualitative structure of the spectrum is the same for all values of @xmath1 and there is alwas an energy gap between the ground and first excited state .",
    "thus the question remains whether there are any physical signatures for the change of the scaling behavior of the entanglement at @xmath131 .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the bi - partite entanglement of two partitions of the @xmath0 spin @xmath132 system . we have seen ( cf .",
    "figbipartite - entangle-3 ) that for @xmath133 the von neumann entropy has a maximum value independent on @xmath18 . in this section",
    "we will quantitatively analyze this maximum by determining the @xmath0-partite or global entanglement @xmath134 of the susy ground state ( [ susy - state ] ) which is an upper bound to the bipartite entanglement @xmath135 .",
    "although it is not possible to obtain an analytic expression for @xmath134 , we can determine a very good estimate for it given by the geometric measure of entanglement .",
    "a many - particle state is called @xmath0-partite separable , if it can be written as a product of states of all @xmath0 sub - systems .",
    "obviously a bi - partite entangled state is always @xmath0-partite entangled but not vice versa .",
    "a quantitative measure of many - particle or _ global _ entanglement of a state @xmath136 is the minimum relative entropy which determines the minimum distance between @xmath136 and the set @xmath137 of @xmath0-partite product states @xmath138 @xcite @xmath139where @xmath140@xmath141 being an @xmath0-partite separable state @xmath142with @xmath143 and @xmath144 . for the bi - partite case",
    "@xmath134 is equivalent to the entanglement of formation @xcite , which in the case of pure states is identical to the von neumann entropy .",
    "since the set @xmath137 is smaller than @xmath145 for any partioning , @xmath146 , it follows immediately @xmath147i.e .",
    "the global entanglement represents an upper bound to the bi - partite entanglement .    in order to compute @xmath134 for any state @xmath136",
    ", one has to find its closest product state @xmath138 .",
    "this is in general a quite difficult task and can be done only in very special cases .",
