    "the group of about @xmath8 so - called central compact objects ( ccos ) in supernova remnants ( snrs ) are distinguished by their steady surface thermal x - ray flux , lack of surrounding pulsar wind nebula , and non - detection at any other wavelength @xcite .",
    "three ccos are known pulsars , with periods in the range @xmath9  s , and spin - down rates that provide an estimate of their surface dipole magnetic field strength , which falls in the range @xmath10  g @xcite , smaller than that of any other young neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "this weak magnetic field is evidently the physical basis of the cco class .",
    "the homogeneous properties of the approximately seven remaining ccos that have not yet been seen to pulse suggest that they have similar or even weaker @xmath7-fields than the known cco pulsars , and a more uniform surface temperature . that ccos are found in snrs ( of ages",
    "@xmath11  yr ) in comparable numbers to other classes of nss implies that they must represent a significant fraction of ns births , probably greater than that of magnetars , for example , as only 45 galactic snrs are known to host magnetars @xcite .",
    "the subsequent evolution of ccos is a glaring unknown , their immediate descendants not being evident in any existing survey .",
    "ccos should persist as cooling nss , detectable in thermal x - rays , for @xmath12  years according to ns cooling curves @xcite . if some are also radio pulsars , that phase could last for @xmath13  years . while there are not yet enough ccos to know whether they are intrinsically radio - quiet , it is very unlikely that the huge expected population of cco descendants are _ all _ hiding simply due to unfavorable radio beaming .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to understand why the region of ( @xmath14 ) space in which ccos are found , between the bulk of the ordinary radio pulsars and the recycled `` millisecond''pulsars in binary systems , is relatively empty .    most of the pulsars in this sparse region ( see figure  [ fig : ppdot ] ) are thought to be `` mildly recycled , '' having been spun up by accretion from a high - mass companion for a relatively short time before a second sn occurred .",
    "defined as having @xmath0  ms and @xmath1  g , mildly recycled pulsars include double ns systems , and single ones thought to be the disrupted recycled pulsars ( drps , @xcite ) ejected when the binary is unbound after the second sn .",
    "( these are in contrast to the millisecond pulsars , which have low - mass companions . )",
    "the drps have characteristic ages @xmath15 of @xmath16  yr .",
    "historically , it was thought that hardly any pulsars are born with @xmath17  g , so that all such pulsars must be recycled .",
    "but the discovery of young ccos in this region of parameter space invalidates that assumption . just as the @xmath18  yr characteristic age of a cco is meaningless",
    ", the possibility that _ any _ low @xmath7-field radio pulsar is much younger than its characteristic age may now be considered .",

    "the meaning of these x - ray non - detections of drps for the evolution of ccos depends on the volume sampled by the surveys that discovered both populations , and their relative completeness .",
    "both are difficult to evaluate ; however , the volumes appear to be at least comparable .",
    "the @xmath2 ccos are found in snrs up to a maximum distance of @xmath137  kpc , and the drps appear to have a similar distribution of distance and galactic coordinates .",
    "therefore , the absence of radio pulsar counterparts of orphaned ccos appears to be real , at least in the range of magnetic field strengths which define the drps .",
    "@xcite noted that roughly four of the drps so defined could actually be interlopers from the population of normal pulsars , as extrapolated from the statistics of studies such as @xcite .",
    "however , as we argued previously , it may not be possible to make such a distinction . in any case",
    ", it would not change our conclusions regarding the fate of ccos , that there are no known radio pulsars with @xmath1  g that are their immediate , @xmath138  yr old , descendants , where we would expect to find @xmath139 orphans .",
    "another clue to the age of drps should be their distribution of heights @xmath140 above the galactic plane as listed in table  [ tab : drps ] .",
    "however , as discussed by @xcite , these heights are smaller than one would expect for the average ns kick velocity of @xmath141  km  s@xmath112 @xcite , which makes it difficult to use @xmath140 as an indicator of age for drps . at this velocity",
    "a ns would travel only 270  pc in @xmath142  yr , implying that x - ray detected orphaned ccos could have a similar @xmath140 height as the drps , which are thought to be much older .",
    "since they are old , the small scale height of the drps still requires an explanation .",
    "@xcite propose that the first sn in the parent binary was of a different type that would give little or no kick to the system , perhaps an electron - capture sn .",
    "a priori , one might not have expected dprs to be orphaned ccos .",
    "as it is , there are not enough drps compared to double ns systems according to standard evolutionary models that link them @xcite .",
    "any drp that is reassigned to a different population would only exacerbate this shortage .",
    "still , the evolutionary fate of ccos remains unknown after this survey .",
    "one possible solution is that radio luminosity is a declining function of spin - down power .",
    "if so , radio surveys could be grossly incomplete in detecting such low @xmath129 pulsars even though they are on the active side of the radio pulsar death line .",
    "there is good evidence that ordinary radio pulsars behave this way , with @xmath143 @xcite , because there is no pileup in the number of pulsars near the death line .",
    "however , it is not clear that this effect alone could explain the absence of orphaned ccos , because there are in fact many radio pulsars with lower @xmath129 than the cco pulsars .",
    "such an effect may also apply to the seven  discovered , radio - quiet isolated neutron stars ( inss , * ? ? ? * ) which , however , have strong magnetic fields @xcite , but are close to the radio pulsar death line . the inss ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppdot ] ) are a good analogy to our problem in that they _ are _ plausibly the descendants of the magnetars , following a fast epoch of magnetic field decay around @xmath144  yr @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the inss are kept hot for longer than ccos by their continuing magnetic field decay for up to @xmath64  yr @xcite , which could account for their abundance relative to the elusive orphaned ccos",
    ".    it may be difficult to detect and/or recognize orphaned ccos if they cool faster than ordinary nss .",
    "one effect that can accelerate cooling is an accreted light - element envelope , which has higher heat conductivity than an iron surface @xcite .",
    "however , this effect actually makes ccos hotter than bare nss for their first @xmath145  yr , after which their temperatures plummet .",
    "therefore , the prediction that cco descendants should be detectable in soft x - rays remains robust .",
    "another plausible home for orphaned ccos would be among the radio pulsars with magnetic fields comparable to or higher than those of the cco pulsars .",
    "one theory for ccos postulates that they are born with a canonical ns magnetic field of @xmath146  g that was largely buried by fall - back of a small amount of supernova ejecta , @xmath147 , during the hours and days after the explosion .",
    "the buried field will diffuse back to the surface on a time scale that is highly dependent on the amount of mass accreted @xcite , after which the ccos will join the bulk of the population of ordinary pulsars . for accretion of @xmath148 ,",
    "the regrowth of the surface field is largely complete after @xmath149  yr , but if @xmath150 is accreted , then the diffusion time could be millions of years .",
    "such a scenario addresses the absence of ccos descendants ; they turn into ordinary pulsars",
    ". it also has the advantage of not requiring yet another class of ns to exist that would only exacerbate the apparent excess of pulsars with respect to the galactic core - collapse supernova rate , a problem emphasized by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , magnetic field growth has long been considered a reason why measured pulsar braking indices are all less than the dipole value of 3 . in this picture ,",
    "ccos represent one extreme in the evolution of surface magnetic field , and almost any radio pulsar _",
    "might _ be a former cco .",
    "finally , an intrinsically strong crustal magnetic field appears to be necessary to explain the existence of the thermal hot spots that enable us to detect pulsations from ccos in the first place ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "for the first @xmath67  yr , rapid field growth can only move a cco vertically upward in the @xmath151 diagram .",
    "such movement is difficult to detect directly using ccos , because it would require measuring the braking index or observing the change of the dipole magnetic field spectroscopically , neither of which is likely to be possible if the relevant time scale is @xmath152  yr .",
    "however , during their first @xmath145  yr , orphaned ccos in this scenario should still have periods of @xmath153  s and could have magnetic fields in the range @xmath154  g. a search of all 159 isolated radio pulsars in this range for thermal x - ray emission from such `` old '' pulsars would provide a promising avenue for finding orphaned ccos . of these ,",
    "two are known x - ray sources , the faint ( @xmath155  erg  s@xmath112 ) nearby radio pulsars psr b1451@xmath2668 and psr b0950 + 08 .",
    "x - rays from these sources are attributed to a combination of heated polar caps and non - thermal ( magnetospheric ) emission @xcite .",
    "if further x - ray surveys of radio pulsars fail to find any orphaned ccos , then it will be difficult to escape the conclusion that they are intrinsically radio quiet .",
    "following the discovery that ccos have weaker magnetic fields than any other young pulsar , it became apparent that their descendants were not obviously present in radio or x - ray surveys .",
    "if their magnetic fields at birth are intrinsic , and do not change with time , then the region around the ccos in the @xmath156 diagram of radio pulsars should be densely populated with all of their descendants , unless they are radio quiet .",
    "the fact that this area is quite sparsely populated led us to survey a large fraction of the available radio candidates in x - rays , those which were previously understood to be mildly recycled pulsars . the `` smoking pulsar '' evidence of an orphaned cco should be an x - ray hot ns that could be detected , in a short observation , at an age up to @xmath145  yr , which is much younger than the characteristic ages of the targeted drps but much older than the known ccos . only upper limits on their thermal x - ray luminosities were found , in the range log @xmath3=31.8 - 32.8 $ ] , which implies cooling ages @xmath4  yr .",
    "up to the age limits implied by the x - ray non - detections , there should be @xmath157 cco descendants in the volume sampled by radio pulsar surveys .",
    "since none have been found among radio pulsars with @xmath1  g , the next step should be to search for young , cooling nss among the radio pulsars with larger @xmath7-fields , comparable to or even larger than that of the cco , with @xmath158  g. an especially interesting possibility is that ccos have intrinsically strong @xmath7-fields that were promptly buried by a small amount of supernova debris , but will grow back to `` normal '' strength in @xmath144  yr .",
    "if such descendants of ccos are found in thermal x - rays among the ordinary radio pulsar population , it would help solve problems about their surface thermal patterns in addition to their evolution . otherwise ,",
    "if the orphaned ccos are truly radio silent for some unknown reason , they could still be found in more sensitive all - sky surveys in soft x - rays , by analog with the ( evidently more luminous ) inss that were discovered this way .",
