    "bead - spring models for linear polymers , wherein the polymer is modelled as a sequence of beads connected by springs , play a central role in the theory of polymer dynamics . for a linear bead - spring polymer chain , with position @xmath0 of the @xmath1-th bead , @xmath2 , the potential energy is given by @xmath3 ,",
    "in which @xmath4 is the spring constant . within the scope of bead - spring models , the rouse model @xcite holds a special status , as it provides a framework for linear polymers by which virtually any static and dynamical quantity of interest can be calculated analytically @xcite . in the rouse model",
    "the dynamics of the beads is formulated in the overdamped limit . for solving the rouse model",
    "one considers the so - called rouse modes ( rather than the equations of motion for the individual beads ) . using the mode amplitude correlation functions ,",
    "the quantities of interest for a phantom chain can be analytically tracked by reconstructing them from the modes @xcite .",
    "the rouse model has been shown useful for self - avoiding linear polymers @xcite , and to show that the dynamics of a tagged bead in a linear bead - spring model is described by the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a natural question to ask if the analytical solution of the rouse model can be generalized to higher dimensions , e.g. , making it useful for the dynamics of polymerized membranes .",
    "there is a considerable amount interest in the properties of polymerized membranes @xcite .",
    "the interest stems not only from the point of view of a fundamental understanding , but also because of their importance in biology and chemistry .",
    "instances of polymerized membranes with a fixed connectivity can be found in 2d - cytoskeletons of cells @xcite and graphite oxide sheets @xcite .",
    "static properties of polymerized membranes as a two - dimensional extension of ( one - dimensional ) linear polymers came into fashion in the late 80s . at that time",
    "the driving question centered on the equilibrium properties of polymerized membranes , in particular , the scaling of the radius of gyration of a polymerized membrane with its lateral size , while the corresponding scaling behavior for phantom and self - avoiding linear polymers were already well - known .",
    "sophisticated renormalized group approaches were developed to this end @xcite , accompanied by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "a notable outcome of these studies is that the radius of gyration @xmath5 of a membrane scales with its lateral size @xmath6 as @xmath7 for phantom , and as @xmath8 for self - avoiding membranes .",
    "in contrast to the equilibrium properties , the dynamical properties of membranes have been studied with less intensity .",
    "apart from scaling analyses @xcite , the bulk of the research on the dynamics of polymerized membranes are heavily dominated by computer simulations @xcite , leaving exact analytical results on the dynamics of membranes a relatively open area . in this paper",
    "we attempt to fill this void  we consider two - dimensional square - polymerized phantom membranes embedded in a three - dimensional space , both in the absence and the presence of tensile forces  and perform a rouse mode analysis .",
    "we show that the rouse modes are the _ exact _ eigenmodes of the membrane dynamics .",
    "akin to the rouse model for bead - spring linear polymers , our exercise allows us to exactly solve for the static and dynamic properties of phantom membranes ; in this process also deriving the exact expression for the scaling of @xmath5 as a function of the membrane s lateral size @xmath6 ( which confirms the @xmath7 scaling ) , as well as show increased fluctuations at the edge of the membrane @xcite .",
    "in particular , we draw the reader s attention to the exact solution under tensile forces , for which forces the membrane essentially encounters a flat geometry . unlike a phantom membrane in equilibrium , in such a situation the membrane becomes essentially flat , does not get the opportunity to intersect itself , and therefore provides a highly useful and exactly soluble approach to the dynamics for a realistic model flat membrane .",
    "we also note that the methods are generalizable to arbitrary internal and spatial dimensions .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe the dynamical equations without forces , and their diagonalization by the rouse modes . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we derive the scaling of the radius of gyration , the mean - square displacement of a tagged bead and the autocorrelation function of a vector connecting two beads . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we incorporate tensile forces in the dynamical equations and derive the new rouse modes that diagonalize them .",
    "we finally end the paper with a discussion in sec .",
    "we consider a rectangular polymerized membrane , for which @xmath9 beads are connected in a perpendicular toplogy , with @xmath10 denoting the spacial position at time @xmath11 of the bead internally labeled as @xmath12 .",
    "naturally for a membrane it is convenient to take two numbers @xmath13 for labeling the beads with @xmath14 .",

    "limit the dynamics of each bead of the membrane is described by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the friction coefficient of the solvent and @xmath18 is the thermal force on the @xmath12-th bead .",

    "first we define @xmath27 and @xmath28   , \\quad f_{{\\bf p}}({\\bf n } ) = f_{p_1}(n_1)f_{p_2}(n_2 ) \\label{eq : fdef}\\ ] ] the orthogonality relation at the basis of the proof for the rouse modes for a linear polymer chain can then be generalized for the membrane @xmath29 where the summation is taken over all allowed values of @xmath12 .",
    "the rouse modes amplitudes and the corresponding inverse are then given by @xmath30 @xmath31 the position of the center - of - mass @xmath32 at time @xmath11 simply equals @xmath33 .",
    "next , we note that when the equations of motion from eq .",
