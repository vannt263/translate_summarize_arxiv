    ", the time lags between the variations in the continuum flux and the emission - lines fluxes are used to estimate the broad line region s ( blr ) size and map its geometry .",
    "twenty low - luminosity agn ( seyfert  1 galaxies ) were spectrophotometrically monitored and their blr sizes were measured using this method .",

    "( 2000 , apj , 533 , 631 ) measured blr sizes for 17 high - luminosity agn ( quasars ) which increased the luminosity range of objects with known blr size by two orders of magnitude .",

    "used all those blr size measurements to determine for the first time the size  mass ",
    "luminosity relations over a luminosity range of 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "the above sample is luminosity and redshift limited because of the small telescopes used . in order to increase the luminosity beyond 10@xmath0",

    "-0.2 cm for the past 8 yr we have been monitoring photometrically a sample of 11 high - redshift ( 2.1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 3.2 ) , high - luminosity ( 10@xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath5 @xmath2 10@xmath6 ergs@xmath1 ) quasars .",
    "the choice of the objects in this sample is purely observational ( limits on redshift , declination , observed flux , etc . ) .",
    "the observations are carried out every month at the _ wise observatory _ using broad - band filters ( @xmath7 & @xmath8 ) ; thus we have good coverage of continuum variability .",

    "our typical upper limit for the line variability is @xmath11% .",
    "this is not surprising since these high - luminosity quasars are expected to have blr sizes of order 3 light years which correspond , in our frame , to about a decade .",
    "in addition , significant continuum variation are needed to produce a detectable line response .",
    "comparison with low - luminosity agn shows that the continua of the high - luminosity quasars have smaller variability amplitudes and longer variability timescales .",
    "we expect that , when this long - term project is concluded , reverberation measurements of the blr size will cover the luminosity range of 10@xmath1210@xmath6 ergss@xmath1 ."
