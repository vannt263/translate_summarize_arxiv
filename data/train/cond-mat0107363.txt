    "body systems are effectively governed by one and two  body forces .",
    "this fact led to work on the two  body random ensembles for fermions  @xcite and to the introduction of the @xmath0body embedded ensembles by mon and french  @xcite . in the embedded ensembles , many  body states are constructed by distributing @xmath3 particles over @xmath2 degenerate single  particle levels .",

    "recently , three of the present authors introduced a novel analytical approach to the fermionic embedded ensembles in the limit of infinite matrix dimension ( @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "the main results of this approach are : ( i )  for @xmath7 , the average spectrum has semicircle shape , and the spectral fluctuation properties coincide with those of rmt ; ( ii )  the spectral density changes shape at or near @xmath8 and becomes gaussian ; ( iii )  in the dilute limit ( @xmath9 ) the spectral fluctuations are completely uncorrelated ( poissonian ) ; ( iv )  the spectral fluctuations change gradually from wigner ",

    "this limit is realized either by letting @xmath10 ( the same limit as for fermions ) , or by letting @xmath1 with @xmath0 and @xmath2 fixed .",
    "this second case , the dense limit , is novel and has no analogue in the fermionic case . in the following ,",
    "we focus attention exclusively on the dense limit .",
    "we prove analytically that in this limit , the ensemble is not ergodic .",
    "numerical results for the spectral correlations are obtained by both ensemble unfolding and by spectral unfolding . in the latter case",

    "we are led to the important conclusion that the bosonic ensembles are not ergodic in the dense limit @xmath1 with @xmath0 and @xmath2 fixed .",

    "we have also plotted a gaussian density whose width is given by the theoretical prediction  @xcite and which agrees with the shape of the ensemble  averaged density .",
    "the striking differences between each of the two spectral densities and between these and the ensemble  averaged spectral density illustrate the non  ergodic character of begoe(2 ) for @xmath85 .",
    "the gaussian form of the ensemble  averaged spectrum arises as a consequence of the central limit theorem .",
    "it has no bearing on individual spectral shapes .",
    "the evaluation of measures of spectral fluctuations requires the spectra to be unfolded .",
    "unfolding can be done either individually for each spectrum ( spectral unfolding ) or by a single transformation which is applied to all spectra of the ensemble ( ensemble unfolding ) .",
    "we employed both types of unfolding in our statistical analysis . for spectral unfolding",
    ", a polynomial was fitted to the staircase function of each realization of a spectrum .",
    "starting from the value unity , we changed the degree of the polynomial for each realization until the first minimum of the associated @xmath94 distribution was reached .",
    "the maximum degree considered was 20 .",
    "the first minimum was typically found around degree 11 .",
    "ensemble unfolding was carried out by first averaging the staircase functions over the ensemble .",
    "the averaged staircase function was fitted by a polynomial of degree 11 .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath92 realizations for @xmath93 .",
    "after fitting the polynomials by including all levels of each spectrum for both spectral and ensemble unfolding , we only considered @xmath95 of all levels , i.e. , @xmath96 levels for each realization located in the centre part of each spectrum .    in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we show the nearest  neighbour spacing distribution @xmath97 and the @xmath98statistics obtained for @xmath99 by ensemble unfolding and by spectral unfolding . in both cases",
    "the distribution @xmath97 corresponds neither to the wigner surmise nor to a poisson distribution . in the case of ensemble",
    "unfolding the level repulsion characteristic of the goe is clearly lost . for spectral unfolding the distribution @xmath97",
    "is dominated by a prominent peak centered at @xmath100 suggesting that individual spectra have an almost constant level spacing .",
    "the @xmath98statistics obtained by ensemble unfolding deviates rapidly from goe behaviour and increases almost linearly . in the case of spectral unfolding",
    ", @xmath101 is almost constant up to @xmath102 .",
    "this result again suggests a tendency of individual spectra towards a picket  fence  like behaviour . beyond this range",
    ", @xmath101 grows albeit less rapidly than for ensemble unfolding .",
    "we turn to the detailed structure of individual spectra .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the staircase function @xmath103 for a typical member of the ensemble ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by levels with almost constant spacing .",
    "the staircase function typically displays one or more points where an abrupt change in the density of states takes place . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the spectrum has ( almost ) constant spacing up to the level @xmath107 . from level @xmath108 on",
    ", the spacing between neighbouring levels is no longer constant .",
    "however , the spacing between next  to  nearest  neighbours does have this property and is almost the same as the nearest  neighbour spacing before level @xmath108 .",
    "this is illustrated by the vertical lines plotted above and below the staircase function .",
    "these observations imply non  stationary properties of the spectra .",
    "in addition , our result suggests that the spectrum of an individual member of the ensemble consists of pieces of overlapping segments of spectra with almost constant level spacings .",
    "the kink at level @xmath108 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] marks the left edge of the overlap region .",
    "the overlap of two segments of almost equidistant levels also influences the structure of the eigenfunctions .",

    "the eigenvectors with @xmath118 620 , 622 , 624 are much more localized in fock space .",
    "they differ in the number of intensity oscillations .",
    "as @xmath115 increases , so does this number , and the levels on this second segment become more and more delocalized . at some point",
    "the spread of the eigenfunctions in the second segment is indistinguishable from that in the first one .",
    "we have studied the spectral behaviour of the bosonic embedded ensembles in the dense limit attained by letting @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath0 fixed .",
    "we have shown that in this limit , both the begoe(@xmath0 ) and the begue(@xmath0 ) are non  ergodic . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first case of a random  matrix model for which such non  ergodic behaviour has been established in the limit of infinite matrix dimension .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the spectral fluctuations deviate strongly from rmt results .",
    "this result disagrees with the conclusions based on numerical simulations of refs .",
    "we ascribe this disagreement to the fact that the ratios @xmath119 considered in refs .",
    "@xcite were too small to produce deviations from wigner ",
