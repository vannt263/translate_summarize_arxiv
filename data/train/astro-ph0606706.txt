    "the nature of the extragalactic gamma ray background emission has been a topic of great interest since egret collaboration evaluated its spectrum in the range from 30 mev to 100 gev @xcite .",
    "the diffuse emission coming from beyond the galaxy was determined by subtracting the contributions of resolved point sources , the diffuse galactic emission , and the instrumental background from the gamma - ray intensities observed by egret .",
    "the emission is found to be a power law in energy @xmath0 and is highly isotropic on the sky .",
    "@xcite suggested that blazars can explain up to 25 per cent of the extragalactic emission .",
    "the hypothesis that the flux is predominantly due to blazars seems to be reinforced by a new evaluation of the extragalactic emission @xcite which is slightly lower and steeper than that found by @xcite .",
    "the result is not consistent with a power law and shows some positive curvature which the authors relate to an origin in blazars emission .",
    "@xcite recently suggested that up to 85 per cent of the extragalactic emission could arise from blazars . according to @xcite blazars",
    "can account for the entire extragalactic @xmath1-ray background observed by egret .",
    "above 100 mev normal galaxies contribute from 3 to 10 per cent of the observed diffuse extragalactic flux .",
    "however from the analysis of @xcite the spectrum of normal galaxies seems to differ from the extragalactic diffuse emission spectrum .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the extragalactic diffuse arises from cosmic rays interacting with intergalactic gas .",
    "this contribution seems to disagree with the diffuse gamma ray spectrum according to @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested fossil radiation from shock accelerated cosmic rays during structure formation as possible contribution . @xcite",
    "have estimated that inverse compton scattering of starlight photon fields by the ultrarelativistic electrons in kiloparsec - scale jets in fr i radio galaxies contributes about one percent to the egret extragalactic flux . @xcite and @xcite have shown that upscattering of cmb to @xmath1-ray energies by cosmic ray electrons and protons does not provide a sinificant contribution to the diffuse extragalactic emission .",
    "however , the question about the origin of the extragalactic emission is still open and can possibly be solved by admitting that different sources contribute to it .",
    "in fact all unresolved discrete sources outside the galaxy contribute to the extragalactic background emission ; the problem is clearly to understand how big the different contributions are .",
    "as already pointed out by @xcite , who considered grbs as a source for the diffuse gamma - ray emission at mev energies , prompt and delayed emissions from grbs should also contribute to the diffuse extragalactic emission , especially if some grbs emit photons in the gev - tev energy .",
    "in fact , outside the grb source , due to interactions with cosmic infra - red background photons , most of the high energy grb photons produce high - energy electron - positron pairs .",
    "the pairs inverse compton scatter off cmb photons and produce secondary photons , which in turn interact with ir photons and generate other pairs .",
    "multiple inverse compton scatterings occur until the energy of the secondary photons is no longer large enough to trigger pair production with the ir photons . when the energy of the scattered photons is not sufficient to produce a subsequent pair , the photons travel to the earth without undergoing further absorption .",
    "after multiple pair - production and inverse compton processes , the initial energy of the tev photons escaping the grbs will have been shifted to mev - gev energies @xcite .",
    "the data on extragalactic diffuse emission in the mev - gev energy range are thus useful to put constraints on high energy emission from gamma ray bursts at gev - tev energy .    in the following",

    "the huge energy released by grbs is almost certainly produced by ultra - relativistic flows , whose bulk lorentz factors @xmath7 may vary in the range of 100 and 1000 , with a typical value of 300 @xcite .",
    "the widely accepted fireball internal - external shock model for grbs envisages that high energy protons and electrons are accelerated in shocks by interaction with magnetic fields .",
    "the process of fermi acceleration leads to electron and proton power - law spectra of index between -2 and -3 .",
    "electrons and protons cool through synchrotron emission .",
    "since the electron cooling time is shorter than the proton cooling time , as a first approximation , the grb prompt spectrum is believed to be dominated by electron synchrotron emission only .",
    "the observed prompt spectrum arising from electron synchrotron emission is a band function @xcite , proportional to @xmath8 below the synchrotron peak energy , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 about -1 and to @xmath11 above the peak energy , with @xmath12 usually between -2 and -3 . below the synchrotron self absorption energy , @xmath13 ,",

    "can be produced in both internal @xcite and external @xcite shocks , either through electron inverse compton or proton synchrotron emission .",
    "@xcite proposed that the cross inverse compton scattering between the photons and electrons in forward and reverse shocks can also produce tev photons .",
    "tev photons can be also generated through inverse compton scattering of shock accelerated particles in external shocks off a bath of photon that overlaps the shocked region .",
    "the photon bath could be either the prompt gamma - ray emission itself @xcite or the late - time x - ray flares @xcite .",
    "for such distant sources as grbs , tev photons are mostly absorbed through pair production with cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) , but some indications of tev gamma rays from grbs at low redshift were provided by experiments like milagro @xcite , hegra @xcite and tibet @xcite . in our calculation",
    "tev prompt energy photons are taken into account in the prompt spectrum without investigating the details of the way they are created .",
    "we model the grb prompt tev emission as an additional broken power law with low energy spectral index @xmath15 and high energy spectral index @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath19 is about 300 - 1000 .",
    "since most high energy emission components are related to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering , we design our high energy component to mimic the ic in the internal shocks .",
    "the typical separation between the synchrotron typical frequency and the ic typical frequency is @xmath20 , which varies between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
