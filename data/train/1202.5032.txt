    "<S> this problem is circumvented by encoding the qubit in the low - lying singlet - triplet subspace of a two - electron double quantum dot@xcite . fast electrical control of the exchange coupling , @xmath2 , via the tilt of the effective double - well potential allows sub - ns rotations about the @xmath3-axis of the bloch sphere .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to perform arbitrary rotations of such a qubit , though , one must introduce a difference , @xmath4 , between the local magnetic fields at each dot , resulting in rotation about the @xmath0-axis of the bloch sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done either by pumping a nuclear spin polarization gradient@xcite or by depositing a micromagnet nearby@xcite . however , </S>",
    "<S> a problem remains : the local magnetic field typically fluctuates slowly due to second - order nuclear spin flip - flops mediated by the hyperfine coupling to the electron spin@xcite and due to charge - noise - induced shifts of the double dot position in the inhomogeneous field . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting uncertainty in @xmath4 introduces a quasi - static random component to the rotation about the @xmath0-axis which , in the course of ensemble averaging , leads to rapid decoherence of the qubit on the free induction decay timescale of @xmath5 . in the case of quantum memory , </S>",
    "<S> dynamical decoupling techniques@xcite can be employed to preserve qubit information long beyond @xmath5 , up to a time @xmath6 at which this information is ultimately lost due to dynamical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> however , such echo techniques can not be performed simultaneously with arbitrary single - qubit rotations , so gate errors are still dominated by statistical fluctuations and depend on the ratio of the gate time to @xmath5 rather than to @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> the qubit is manipulated via the electrically controlled exchange coupling , @xmath12 , which is constrained to be positive ( except in very high magnetic fields , when it is always negative ) and is restricted in magnitude by the fact that as it is increased by tilting the double dot potential , the qubit information starts to transfer from the spin state into the charge state of the double dot and is hence subject to rapid decoherence due to electrical noise , so that one must impose a limit , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the constraint to positive rotations is also relevant to exchange - only coded qubits@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to design a pulse in @xmath12 that respects these constraints and performs a given rotation in a way that is insensitive to @xmath11 . </S>",

    "<S> this set of figures shows the average error per gate ( defined in the main text ) as functions of @xmath26 , for rotations by @xmath27 about the ( a )  @xmath0-axis and ( b )  @xmath3-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the corrected pulses cancel the leading order error . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : finiteh],title=\"fig : \" ]    for @xmath16 , the noncommutation of the hamiltonian at different times even for @xmath40 makes the previous approach algebraically forbidding . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case we have the possibility to perform rotations about axes @xmath41 other than @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of this freedom in order to construct supcode pulses in a simple way : we first take an uncorrected ( i.e. , designed as if @xmath40 ) rotation @xmath42 and then construct an uncorrected identity operation @xmath43 designed such that the error in its implementation exactly cancels the leading order error in the original rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we represent the uncorrected rotations @xmath42 in terms of ideal rotations @xmath44 as @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the first order corrections . for the corrected pulse @xmath49 , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that we want to make @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> because there are infinitely many ways to realize the identity operation , there is sufficient freedom to engineer such a cancelation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we consider a product of parameterized forms of the identity such as @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are parameters satisfying @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a positive integer .    as an explicit demonstration of supcode </S>",
    "<S> , we show rotations around the @xmath0- and @xmath3-axes by arbitrary angles @xmath58 for the particular case @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> ( combinations of these are sufficient for universal one - qubit gates . ) about @xmath60 , the uncorrected rotation is performed by holding @xmath61 for a time @xmath62 , and this is preceded by the identity @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are chosen such that errors cancel ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> about @xmath21 , the uncorrected rotation is performed by a three - part pulse@xcite @xmath66 , and this is preceded by the identity @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are chosen such that errors cancel ( see supplementary information ) . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : finiteh ] for @xmath71 , supcode does indeed lead to a higher - order scaling of the error in @xmath26 ( and hence in @xmath72 ) , and a reduction of error when @xmath26 is less than a few percent . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , when @xmath73 , errors are typically reduced by an order of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> the tradeoff here is that supcode rotations are typically over an order of magnitude longer than uncorrected rotations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that for a given experimental set of parameters one should try optimizing the pulse sequence , which we have not done for the arbitrarily - chosen example above , as both the length and error of the corrected pulses could certainly be reduced by a significant constant factor by searching over different constructions of the identity , @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , for experiments in gaas systems with pumped nuclear spins@xcite ( @xmath75ev , @xmath76nev ) or micromagnets@xcite ( @xmath77nev , @xmath78nev ) the sequences shown here could already deliver substantial improvement over the uncorrected ones .    </S>",
    "<S> realistic deviations from the ideal pulses assumed above would include charge noise , which adds a random quasi - static contribution to the exchange , and finite rise times . </S>",
    "<S> the former could be reduced by using a multi - electron variant of the singlet - triplet qubit@xcite and , in principle , it may even be possible to dynamically correct by adding more degrees of freedom to the pulses . the latter could be compensated for by adjusting pulse parameters given the actual turn - on / off profiles of the pulse for a specific experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even in nonideal conditions supcode could enable precise spin qubit rotations independent of shot - to - shot variation in the nuclear overhauser field , also easing tasks such as ensemble - averaged measurements of singlet probability oscillations versus time by reducing hyperfine - induced decay . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , this work allows satisfaction of the quantum error correction threshold within a substantially larger region of the physical parameter space than would otherwise be possible . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath6 has now reached tens of microseconds in gaas quantum dots@xcite , and milliseconds@xcite or even seconds in the presence of isotopic purification@xcite in si - based structures implies that gate errors are currently dominated not by dynamical fluctuations in the nuclear spin bath , but by the statistical distribution of the magnetic field gradient , and these errors may be efficiently suppressed by supcode .    _ </S>",
