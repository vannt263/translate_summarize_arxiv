    "nearly all calculations for the determination of mixing angles between different spin - components of baryon wavefunctions are based on spectroscopic models . beside their advantages",
    "these models also contain some problems which are not dissolved yet .",
    "+ the goal of the presented work is an independent way of the determination of mixing angles and range parameters in the harmonic oscillator description of nucleonic resonances within the nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "although the approach in a first step is applied to the spin1/23/2mixing angle @xmath2 in the negative parity resonance @xmath3 ( the underlying nature of this resonance is at the moment object to various speculations ) , the approach also can be applied to many other resonances .",
    "+ the idea of the presented method is as follows : in a first step one has to calculate the total cross section of a process which is dominated by the resonance under consideration in such a way that the only remaining free parameters of the calculation are the mixing angles and the range parameters of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions of the resonance and the involved ground state nucleons . in a second step",
    "the parameters are obtained by adjusting the calculated to the experimentally measured cross section .",
    "+ one process dominated mainly by the @xmath3 is the reaction @xmath1 at threshold . in order to determine the",
    "desired mixing parameters one first has to get a _",
    "quantitative _ understanding not only of the _ short range dynamics _ of the process , but also of the _ initial and final state interactions _ ( isi and fsi ) between the in- and outgoing particles .",
    "main investigations along this line have been performed in @xmath4@xcite and references therein .",
    "the reaction @xmath1 at threshold is described within a relativistic meson - exchange model .",
    "the virtual @xmath3 is excited / deexited by the exchange of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10mesons , while it is deexcited / excited by the produced @xmath8 .",
    "using relativistic normalisations for spinors , creation and annihilation operators it is straight forward to write down the expression for the total cross section of @xmath1 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) : @xmath15 the combinatorial factor of @xmath16 is due to the two outgoing identical protons . for the relativistic description of @xmath1 the following 5 independent invariants are chosen : @xmath17      in order to get a _",
    "quantitative _ understanding of the isi and fsi it is crucial to recall the steps which lead to that what the people nowadays callwatson - migdal approximation \" and what is wrongly implemented in nearly all threshold meson production calculations by now : the system of colliding and produced particles is described by an overall hamilton operator @xmath18 , while @xmath19 is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath20 is the particle number nonconserving short range interaction potential and @xmath21 is the particle number conserving interaction potential of long range . for convenience",
    "additionally one can define the long range hamilton operator @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates to the operators @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath19 fulfil the following schrdinger equations : @xmath25 the corresponding lippmann ",

    "consider now the case , when the only two particles taking part in the isi and fsi are the two in and outgoing protons . in this case",
    "the subsystem of the two protons interacting via the long range potental @xmath21 with phaseshifts @xmath39 ( @xmath40 = orbital angular momentum ) can be treated within the framework of standard nonrelativistic scattering theory . by application of the on - shell approximation of eq .",

    "it is worth to mention that the isi and fsi  factors of eq .",
    "( 8) have the correct limit for vanishing isi or fsi .",
    "if there is no isi or fsi , the phaseshifts will vanish and the corresponding factors will go to 1 . the effect of the watson - migdal approach is a factorization of @xmath28 into a short ranged t - matrix @xmath46 and isi- and fsi - factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the the factor @xmath47 is only a function of @xmath49 , while the short ranged t - matrix @xmath46 close to threshold shows up to be a slowly varying function of the phasespace integration variables and therefore can be set to its threshold value @xmath50 . using this observation",
    "both factors can be drawn in front of the phasespace integral in eq .",
