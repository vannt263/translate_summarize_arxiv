    "as a consequence , the observed anomalies in the physical properties studied become more and more blurred with increasing @xmath6 , and @xmath12 represent a mean ordering temperature of the particular alloys . since the size of the clusters remains finite far below the percolation threshold , a characteristic tail in the magnetic phase diagrams",
    "is visible ( figure [ phase_diagram ] ) . the latter hypothesis need to be verified by further experiments , e.g. ac magnetic susceptibility , neutron diffraction etc .",
    "the collected experimental data revealed that the dilution of the magnetic sublattices of cenige@xmath0 ( @xmath1  =  5.5  k ) and unisi@xmath2 ( @xmath3  =  95  k ) leads to rapid decrease of their ordering temperatures down to about 1.35  k in ce@xmath7y@xmath8nige@xmath9 and 29  k in u@xmath10th@xmath11nisi@xmath2 . further decrease of the ce / u content results in the loss of the long - range character of the magnetic order at finite temperature and in formation of a characteristic tail in the magnetic phase diagrams .",
