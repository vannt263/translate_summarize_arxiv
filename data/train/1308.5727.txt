    "in two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum systems , uncorrelated potential disorder has been shown to lead to complete ( anderson ) localisation of single particle states @xcite .",
    "this statement has been supported by a wealth of experimental , numerical and theoretical results , including the celebrated scaling hypothesis  @xcite and seminal works based on the nonlinear @xmath3 model  @xcite .",
    "states in a 2d system are marginally localised even for small disorder and @xmath4 is the lower critical dimension of the anderson transition in time - reversal invariant systems .",
    "however , while this statement is true in general , it has also been shown that the situation is more complex when correlations in the disorder  @xcite or many - body interactions  @xcite have to be taken into account . even without these additional factors ,",
    "the 2d situation remains challenging since the extent of the localised states for weak disorder can become much larger than the available system sizes , which might lead to results of a feigned extended behaviour .    in graphene , as prototypical 2d material  @xcite , one naturally expects disorder to lead to localisation as well",
    ". however , due to its linear dispersion relation around the dirac point at energy @xmath5 and non - zero momentum , the resulting absence of backscattering in clean samples  @xcite , might lead to a somewhat unusual behaviour .",
    "the localisation properties of graphene in the vicinity of the dirac point have been studied intensively .",
    "it was found that strong disorder leads to localisation at @xmath5  @xcite , while disorder that does not lead to inter - valley mixing does not  @xcite .",
    "the direction of transport along graphene  @xcite and graphene nanoribbons  @xcite was shown to modify the quantitative strengths of the localisation effects .",
    "on the other hand , many , mainly numerical , results have indicated the existence of localisation that is unusually weak at @xmath5  @xcite or close to @xmath5  @xcite . some results supporting mobility edges  @xcite , critical states  @xcite and a metallic - like to insulating transition  @xcite have been put forward .",
    "recent discussions of results at @xmath5  @xcite or for strong disorder at @xmath6  @xcite indicate complete localisation for disorder with inter - valley mixing , in agreement with the earlier studies @xcite and a true metal - insulator transition has only been observed in hydrogenated graphene  @xcite .",

    "[ fig - lambdam_e_w1.5 ] we show this behaviour for 2d graphene flakes with @xmath7 lattice sites .",
    "clearly , increasing the size @xmath8 of the graphene samples leads to increasing localisation lengths around @xmath9 , with energy in units of the hopping energy between carbon atoms , while around @xmath10 the trend seems to have reversed . in this paper",

    "hence our results explain why there is such a diversity of results for the localisation properties of graphene at and close to @xmath5 , i.e.  we find that one needs very large system sizes , larger than @xmath15 lattice sites , to reach the asymptotic regime .     as a function of energy for the zz graphene lattice at disorder @xmath16 and sizes ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",

    "the same procedure leads to two branches , the first one denoting the localised regime and the second one indicating the extended regime with increasing @xmath14 values as @xmath45 increases .",
    "this two - branch behaviour is the signature of the transition from localised to extended states  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can try to assume an analytical form for @xmath53 and test whether this form fits the data with the required accuracy  @xcite .",

    "we will use both fss approaches below .",

    "we first note that at weak disorder ( @xmath64 ) the half of the bandwidth reflects the number of nearest neighbours and hence tends to @xmath65 for the square lattice and tends to @xmath66 for ac and zz graphene  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is the usual approximate symmetry between positive and negative energies . when the strength of the disorder increases the @xmath67 values decrease for all lattices as the wavefunctions become more localised .",
    "for very strong disorder , the localisation lengths are much smaller than the system sizes @xmath45 and @xmath68 and the states are exponentially localised with @xmath67 representing the decay length . on the other hand , for weaker disorder",
    ", the localisation lengths are comparable or larger than the system sizes , and we can no longer assume that the exponential decay implicit in the use of @xmath67 is still justified . then @xmath67 is simply a convenient measure of the spatial extent of the wave functions , but not necessarily linearly related to a localisation length .",
    "still , a larger such extend will imply larger @xmath67 values . with this in mind , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig - ene - sqzzac ] that , for @xmath69 , the localisation lengths increase rapidly as we decrease @xmath34 for the square lattice .",
    "however , for the case of ac and zz graphene lattices , we observe that in the vicinity of @xmath5 , the @xmath67 values again decrease , leading to values of @xmath70 which seem very similar for @xmath71 and @xmath72 . clearly , the drop in @xmath52 in the graphene lattices at @xmath5 is a signature of the dirac point with reduced density of states  @xcite .    in standard quasi-1d tmm , an increasing value of @xmath14 for weak disorder as @xmath73 signals the start of the extended regime .",
    "even with @xmath74 , @xmath52 can still be interpreted as a localisation length since we have @xmath40 and the localisation in the @xmath27 direction is well - defined . as discussed before , the situation might be different for our modified tmm .",

    "however , for energies @xmath79 , increasing @xmath45 gives _ increasing _ @xmath14 values .",
    "such a behaviour for @xmath73 would indicate extended states .",
    "quite similar findings have been reported previously in the same energy range for smaller systems up to @xmath80  @xcite .    clearly , the existence of extended states in the vicinity of the dirac point in weakly disordered ( but with inter - valley mixing ) graphene would be surprising",

    "furthermore ,  ( ii ) increasing the system size does not lead to a clearer crossing , and we can also not identify a simple , monotonic in @xmath45 ( irrelevant ) shift of such a crossing point .",

    "[ fig - ene - sqzzac ] are already reasonably large for tmm  @xcite .",

    "[ fig - ene-01 ] was simply due to finite - size effects , then we should see the increase in @xmath14 vanish for large enough @xmath45 .",

    ", we find the reconstruction of a well - defined fss curve becomes numerically difficult .",
    "nevertheless , the estimated scaling parameter @xmath89 agrees very well with a previous high - precision fss from a quasi-1d tmm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath89 behavior for squares and zz graphene shows a single branch only , consistent with complete localisation .",
    "the situation is rather different for @xmath83 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sqzz - rllvsksis ] .",

    "it is intriguing to see that even for a square lattice , for the range of available system sizes and disorder  determined by the longest tmm runs available to us  we find an apparent transition - like behavior .",
    "obviously , this would be in disagreement with the scaling theory and of course also to the body of numerical results based , among others , on quasi-1d tmm  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we observe transition - like behavior also for zz graphene at @xmath83 . as in the square lattice case",
    ", the onset of the extended branch is around @xmath93 .",
    "we have found similar results also for ac graphene .",
    "@xcite we have also tried to apply fss assuming the expansions of the power - law behaviour  @xcite .",
    "however , we never find an acceptable fit to the data , although we vary not only the expansion coefficients , but also the initial values used in the non - linear fits for @xmath94 , @xmath55 , etc . upon closer inspection",
    ", we find that most such attempts to fit the data lead to @xmath95 and large values of @xmath96 .",
    "but even with these large @xmath55 values , the @xmath14 values rise much faster for small disorder .",
    "this suggests that the true behaviour is not a power - law but rather an exponential as in the well - known square lattice  @xcite .",
    "the fss results of fig .",
    "[ fig - sqzz - rllvsksis ] for @xmath83 and @xmath93 do not show a very clear formation of extended branches , particularly for the square case . in order to test the stability of these branches in fss",
    ", we would need even larger system sizes for _ all _ disorder @xmath93 .",
    "this is , however , numerically prohibitive .",

    "such behaviour , if it were to continue for @xmath73 , would be indicative of critical states .",
    "finally , at @xmath106 , we find a drop in @xmath14 .",
    "the drop is present both in the unweighted mean as well as , and even stronger , in the weighted means .",
    "this indicates that the observed increase in @xmath14 with increasing @xmath45 up to @xmath110 is simply a finite - size effect .",
    "going to larger system sizes recovers the expected behaviour for localised states with decreasing @xmath14 for increasing @xmath45 . the hypothetical `` extended '' fss curves in fig .",
    "[ fig - sqzz - rllvsksis ] should hence be interpreted as an intermediate regime in which the localisation lengths become very large .",
    "indeed , with @xmath111 , this is beyond what has been observed in most previous tmm studies .",
    "a qualitative argument can be put forward to motivate our results . without disorder",
    "the density of states ( dos ) at @xmath5 for a square lattice diverges whereas it is zero for graphene ( zz or ac ) . upon increasing the disorder , the dos for the square lattice decreases as well as the localisation length . for graphene",
    ", the same happens for the van - hove singularities at @xmath112  @xcite . on the other hand , at @xmath5 the dos _ increases _",
    "@xcite , which is well - known to correlate with large localisation lengths .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes should be expected around @xmath113 which is similar to what we observe . for larger disorder @xmath114 or , equivalently ,",
    "larger system sizes @xmath115 , we recover the expected localised regime .    once the modified tmm has reached convergence , the wave functions @xmath116 are true eigenfunctions of the global @xmath117 forward - backward transfer matrix @xmath118 for a given sample .",

    "results for ac graphene are similarly consistent with the literature , i.e.  we find an absence of edge states for the chosen ac graphene lattice sizes consistent with semiconducting behaviour on finite width samples  @xcite .",
    "as expected for square lattices , we do not observe those strong edge states .",
    "our results show that up to lengths scales of @xmath124 times the c - c distance in graphene , i.e.  up to @xmath125 nm , onsite disordered graphene , even with inter - valley scattering , exhibits surprisingly delocalised states in the vicinity of the dirac point .",
    "this corroborates the trend towards similar such delocalisation - like behaviour found previously  @xcite , while also reaffirming that the true infinite system limit obeys the localisation predictions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the tendency for large localisation lengths is so strong that even fss can mislead to construct seemingly extended branches , although a very large system size analysis shows that only the localised behaviour corresponds to the true thermodynamic behaviour  @xcite .",
