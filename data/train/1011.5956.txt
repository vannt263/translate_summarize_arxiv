    "it has long been discussed both observationally and theoretically why some of the galactic gcs show star - to - star inhomogeneity among the light elements of stars and what physical mechanisms are responsible for the inhomogeneity ( e.g. , cottrell & da costa 1981 ; sneden et al .",

    "although such star - to - star inhomogeneity was discovered in 70 s and 80 s ( e.g. , cohen 1978 ; peterson 1980 ; norris et al . 1981 ; leep et al .",
    "1986 ) , recent statistical studies for a larger number of the galactic gcs have established that the presence of multiple stellar populations is an universal phenomena seen across most of the galactic gcs ( e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "2010 ) . the latest observational results by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have revealed that the galactic metal - rich gc tarzan 5 has two different stellar populations with different abundances of heavy elements .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) has also suggested a significant fraction of the galactic gcs have two different populations with different abundances in heavy elements based on color - magnitude diagrams of the gc stars in @xmath8-bands .",
    "now large star - to - star abundance variations have been confirmed in almost unevolved stars in some of the galactic gcs ( e.g. , gratton et al 2001 ; ramirez & cohen 2002 ; bedin et al .",

    "2010a ) , which strongly suggests that after the first generation ( fg ) of stars formed within forming gcs , gas chemically mixed with gaseous ejecta of fg stars was converted into to the second generation ( sg ) of stars ( and even third and fourth generations ) .",
    "observations have now being extensively investigating how chemical properties of sg stars ( e.g. fractions of sg stars ) correlate with their global internal properties ( e.g. , magnitudes and ellipticities ) and with locations and 3d motions with respect to the galactic center to understand the origin of sg stars and physical relationships between formation of fg and sg stars ( e.g. , carretta 2006 , carretta et al .",
    "2010 ) .    following these observational developments ,",
    "theoretical studies have considered that sg stars can form from gaseous ejecta either by agb stars ( `` agb scenario '' ; dantona & caloi 2004 ; karakas et al .",
    "2006 ) or by fast rotating massive stars ( `` frms '' scenario ; prantzos & charbonnel 2006 ; decressin et al . 2007 ) and thereby investigated whether the observed physical properties of the galactic gcs can be explained by their models .",
    "although it has not been determined which of the two can explain observations in a self - consistent manner , a number of authors suggested that the agb scenario is a more physically viable because agb ejecta is more likely to be converted into new stars owing to low ejection velocities ( e.g. , renzini 2008 ) .",
    "recent observations have provided the following two key results which can give strong constraints on any theory for gc formation : ( i ) the large fraction ( typically @xmath9 ) of sg stars in each individual galactic gcs and ( ii ) the observed na - o and mg - al anti - correlations between cluster stars ( e.g. , carreta et al .",
    "2010 for a comprehensive study for these two ) .",
    "the first key result suggests that the original stellar systems ( i.e. , fg stars ) need to be much more massive than the present gcs unless we adopt very unusual and unrealistic imfs ( e.g. , smith & norris 1982 ; dantona & caloi 2004 ) : the original systems are either very massive star clusters or dwarf galaxies hosting gcs ( e.g. , bekki & norris 2006 ) .",
    "if the original systems are really massive ones , then the fg stars need to be preferentially lost while sg ones remain the same so that the observed typical fraction ( @xmath10 ) of sg stars can be explained .    although a number of theoretical works based on the agb scenario tried to explain the second key observational result in a self - consistent manner ( e.g. , fenner et al .",
    "2004 ; bekki et al .",
    "2007 ; dantona et al . 2005 ; dantona & ventura 2007 ; ventura & dantona 2006 , 2008 ; dercole et al .",
    "2010 ) , their models appear to have not yet explained all of the relevant observations on chemical abundances of the galactic gcs in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "chemical evolution models based on the frms scenario have not yet been fully explored so that the validity of the frms scenario can not be currently assessed .    in these previous models , it is assumed that agb ejecta can be converted into new stars ( i.e. , formation of sg stars ) within already existing clusters .",
    "however it would not be so obvious that such secondary star formation can occur within clusters , given the shallow gravitational potential wells of clusters and the small mass fraction of agb ejecta .",
    "therefore , secondary star formation processes within clusters should be investigated by numerical simulations that can include various physical processes within clusters ( e.g. , retention of agb ejecta ) .",
    "dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) first investigated whether sg stars can be formed from the gaseous ejecta of agb stars of fg with @xmath11 .",
    "however , their models are based on one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and have limitations in predicting 3d structures and kinematics of final stellar systems .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) stellar and gas dynamical numerical simulations with a plausible model for star formation are ideal to investigate secondary star formation within clusters and can furthermore provide theoretical predictions that can be compared with the observed differences in 3d structures and kinematics between fg and sg stars ( e.g. , norris et al . 1997 ; ferraro et al .",

    "the purpose of this paper is thus to investigate extensively star formation from gaseous ejecta from agb stars within mscs based on self - consistent hydrodynamical simulations with a reasonable model for star formation .",
    "we adopt a scenario in which ( i ) mscs can be formed in their host galactic building blocks embedded in dark matter halos at high redshifts and ( ii ) new stars formed from agb ejecta can finally become the observed sg stars in the present gcs . based on this scenario , we investigate ( i ) how agb ejecta can be retained within mscs , ( ii ) whether and how secondary star formation from agb ejecta proceeds within mscs , and ( iii ) how mscs evolve if they are located in nuclei of their hosts .",
    "we also investigate how mscs lose their stars during tidal interaction with their hosts in order to discuss the observed smaller fractions of fg stars in the galactic gcs .",
    "a number of previous works discussed a scenario in which gcs were originally stellar galactic nuclei or nuclear star clusters in nucleated galaxies and their host galaxies had been already destroyed by strong tidal fields of much larger galaxies to disappear completely ( e.g. , zinnecker et al .",
    "1988 ; freeman 1993 ; bekki & freeman 2003 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2008 ; bker 2008 ) . following this scenario , bekki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) investigated chemical abundances of fg and sg stars in gcs formed within the central regions of their host galaxies .",
    "the evolution of mscs initially nuclear regions of their hosts in the present study therefore can provide some implications on the validity of the above scenario in explaining observational properties of gcs .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we describe the details of the proposed scenario for gc formation . in  3 , we describe the numerical models for evolution of gaseous ejecta of agb stars within mscs . in  4 , we present the numerical results mainly on physical properties of sg stars . in  5 ,",
    "we discuss how long mscs can retain most of their stars when they are influenced by strong tidal fields of their hosts . in ",
    "6 , we discuss a number of key issues related to the origin of multiple stellar populations in gcs .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  7 .",
    "although we describe the scenario in the context of the galaxy formation , the formation processes of gcs within galaxies in general would be similar to those described below .",
    "the scenario is based on the results from our present and previous theoretical studies on gc formation ( e.g. , bekki et al .",
    "2002 ; bekki et al .",
    "2004 ; bekki & chiba 2007 ; bekki 2006 ; bekki et al .",
    "2007 ; hurley & bekki 2008 ; bekki et al .",
    "2008 ) . since the scenario is based partly on results of cosmological simulations ( e.g. , bekki et al .",
    "2008 ) , the scenario has some implications on the observed correlations between abundance properties of gcs and 3d motion and kinematics of gcs ( e.g. , carretta 2006 ; lee et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the present paper , the masses of the present gcs",
    "are represented by @xmath12 so that @xmath0 ( original masses of the gcs ) and @xmath12 can be discriminated with each other .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        fg stars of mscs form from high - density gmcs with masses ( @xmath13 ) as large as or larger than @xmath14 within the galactic building blocks which are later destroyed owing to the strong tidal field of the galaxy when they merge with the galaxy .",
    "most of the hosts form as massive dwarf galaxies with masses ( @xmath15 ) larger than @xmath16 before reionization ( @xmath17 ) , and thus their star formation and chemical enrichment histories can be different from those of the present dwarfs within the galaxy ( bekki et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the formation places of mscs are highly likely to their hosts central regions where mass fractions of gmcs can be much higher ( i.e , not necessarily in the nuclei of the hosts ) .",
    "the mscs formed in the very centers of their hosts start their lives as nuclear mscs so that their evolution can be different significantly from that for mscs formed outside the very centers owing to much deeper gravitational potentials of hosts central regions .",
    "the host gmcs of mscs may well initially have numerous substructures ( smaller gmcs ) owing to their large masses ( e.g. , efremov 1995 ; bonatto & bica 2010 ) so that mscs at their birth can be composed of a number of smaller clusters ( i.e. , not single entities ) .",
    "these smaller sub - units can finally merge with one other to form single massive clusters within the merging timescale depending on @xmath0 and their sizes ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "massive stars and type ii supernova can strongly influence later evolution of molecular gas left behind from the formation of fg stars .",
    "if most of the energy from massive stars and type ii supernova are converted into kinetic energy of gas surrounding the stars , then gaseous ejecta from the stars can not be mixed well with the residual molecular gas ( bekki & chiba 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , sg formation from gaseous ejecta from the above energetic stars and the mass fraction of sg stars formed from the mixed gas is very small ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "however , if massive stars are frmss with very slow ejection _ radial _ velocities ( @xmath20 km s@xmath21 ) , then the gaseous ejecta could be well mixed with the residual gas to form sg stars before supernova explosion expels a significant fraction of gas .",
    "although type ii supernova can heat up and expel a significant fraction of gas from massive gmcs , some fraction of gas can be immune from the effects of supernova owing to the clumpy nature of the massive gmcs .",
    "the smaller residual clouds may well be later accreted onto the forming clusters to dilute agb ejecta .",
    "while supernova explosion is influencing significantly gmcs , star formation rates within the gmcs can drop significantly .",
    "gaseous ejecta from massive agb stars start to be accreted onto the central regions of mscs after all supernova events finish .",
    "however star formation does not resume until an enough amount of gas can be accumulated within the central regions : there should be a threshold gas mass fraction ( @xmath22 ) above which star formation can start within mscs",
    ". therefore there can be significant time - delay ( @xmath23 yr ) between fg and sg formation in this scenario .",
    "sg stars in a msc start to form efficiently in the central region of the msc when the mass fraction of the accumulated agb ejecta to @xmath0 ( @xmath24 ) exceeds @xmath22 .",
    "this efficient secondary star formation _ from agb ejecta _ can occur only if @xmath0 exceeds a threshold cluster mass ( @xmath1 ) , because agb ejecta can not be efficiently retained in mscs with smaller @xmath0 . during this secondary star formation",
    ", the residual molecular gas can be mixed with agb ejecta to form new stars .",
    "owing to the presence of deeper gravitational potential wells of mscs , star formation efficiencies ( @xmath25 ) can be much higher ( @xmath26 ) for this secondary star formation so that very compact clusters can be formed .",
    "mscs thus can initially show `` nested structures '' with more diffuse distributions of fg stars and more compact ones of sg stars .",
    "although mscs with @xmath0 below @xmath1 can hardly form new stars from agb ejecta , such less massive clusters can still capture residual molecular gas and smaller nearby gmcs ( not chemically contaminated by ejecta from fg stars ) .",
    "cold molecular gas with _ initially very high - densities _ obtained by mscs themselves can be converted into new stars within the central regions of mscs ( bekki & mackey 2009 ) .",
    "very low - mass mscs can be destroyed by interaction with gmcs so that secondary star formation can not happen in their central regions .",
    "therefore , there should be a threshold cluster mass below which mscs show differences neither in ages nor in light elements among their stellar populations .",
    "secondary star formation processes within nuclear mscs can be significantly different from those described above owing to much deeper potential wells of their hosts ( as described in the present study ) .",
    "secondary star formation can continue until mscs lose most of their fg stars , though massive stars and type ii supernova of sg stars can also suppress or even truncate further star formation .",
    "strong tidal fields of hosts can efficiently strip stars preferentially from fg stars owing to initially diffuse spatial distributions . this preferential stripping _ by the galaxy _ has been already proposed by dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and discussed in the context of origin of the galactic stellar halo ( vesperini et al .",
    "the present scenario suggests that not the tidal field of the galaxy but those of hosts of mscs are responsible for the tidal stripping of most fg stars in mscs .",
    "the timescale of a msc to lose most of their fg stars due to tidal stripping by its host depends on its position , with respect to its host ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath0 , and @xmath18 . therefore , more massive and denser mscs can continue secondary star formation longer so that agb stars with lower masses can possibly contribute to further star formation .",
    "hosts of mscs are strongly influenced by the tidal field of the forming galaxy during their merging with the galaxy so that they can be completely destroyed by the galaxy .",
    "the stripped stars from hosts , which include fg stars from mscs , can be some parts of the galactic stellar halo .",
    "mscs are stripped during disintegration of their hosts to finally become halo gcs .",
    "strong ram pressure of the galactic halo gas ( e.g. , frank & gisler 1976 ; bekki 2006 ) and no cold gas available in the halo prevent almost completely star formation of the mscs since they become the galactic halo gcs .",
    "thus , multiple stellar populations can be formed within mscs only when they are within their hosts .",
    "gas can be efficiently transferred to the nuclear regions of hosts to be converted into new stars while they are being destroyed by the galaxy ( e.g. , bekki & freeman 2003 ) .",
    "these new stars can have chemical abundances in heavy elements different from those of original nuclear mscs , because they are from the outer regions , where chemical enrichment histories are quite different from those of nuclei .",
    "nuclear mscs can show star - to - star abundance variations not only in light elements but also in heavy ones .",
    "a number of authors have already suggested that if the standard imf is applied for fg stars and if @xmath25 ( star formation efficiency for sg formation ) is 1.0 , then original total masses of fg stars ( @xmath0 ) are required to be at least ten times larger than the present masses of sg stars in the galactic gcs with multiple stellar populations ( e.g. , bekki & norris 2006 ) . given that @xmath25 is not like 100%",
    "as observed in star - forming regions in the galaxy , the required @xmath0 should be even higher than the above .",
    "recent chemical evolution models have shown that the total mass of pristine gas that can mix with agb ejecta to form sg stars needs to be comparable to that of agb ejecta in order to explain the observed levels of star - to - star abundance variations and the o - na anti - correlation in the galactic gcs ( e.g. , dercole et al .",
    "2010 ) : agb ejecta should not be too much diluted by external gas captured / accreted by mscs . thus the required @xmath0",
    "estimated in previous studies can not change significantly even if contribution from external pristine gas to sg formation is considered .    in the present scenario , gaseous ejecta from agb stars with masses ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29",
    "can contribute to the formation of sg stars within a timescale of @xmath30 ( which determines @xmath31 ) .",
    "we here estimate the mass fraction of agb ejecta to the initial mass of a msc ( @xmath24 ) ( i ) for a given @xmath28 and ( ii ) for a given @xmath30 by assuming @xmath32 and power - law initial mass functions with the slopes of @xmath33 .",
    "the adopted imf in number defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the initial mass of each individual star and the slope @xmath36 corresponds to the salpeter imf .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath37 is a function of @xmath0 , @xmath38 ( lower mass cut - off ) , and @xmath39 ( upper mass cut - off ) : @xmath40 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are set to be @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the total mass of agb ejecta within a msc ( @xmath43 ) is accordingly described as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 describes the total gas mass ejected from an agb star with initial mass @xmath35 and final mass ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we derive an analytic form of @xmath45 ( @xmath47 ) from the observational data by weidemann ( 2000 ) by using the least - square fitting method , and find : @xmath48    in order to calculate the main - sequence turn - off mass ( @xmath49 ) we use the following formula ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) : @xmath50 where @xmath49 is in solar units and time @xmath30 in years .",
    "1 shows that @xmath24 is larger for smaller @xmath31 both for the standard imf ( @xmath51 ) and the top - heavy one ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "although the top - heavy model shows larger @xmath24 than the standard one for @xmath53 , the derived @xmath24 is small : only @xmath54 for @xmath55 and 0.079 @xmath56 .",
    "ventura & dantona ( 2008 ) showed that the observed o - na anti - correlations can be well reproduced only if agb stars with masses larger @xmath57 can contribute to secondary star formation within gcs .",
    "thus , it is highly likely that progenitor clusters for the present gcs . needs to be at least @xmath58 times more massive than the present gcs .    as shown in fig . 1",
    ", @xmath24 can be larger than 0.1 for @xmath59 gyr ( or @xmath60 ) for the two imf models .",
    "it should be here stressed that mscs with larger @xmath30 can end up with a large age difference ( @xmath61 gyr ) between fg and sg stars .",
    "original mscs can lose most of their fg stars due to tidal stripping of their hosts within well less than @xmath62 gyr , as shown later in the present study .",
    "therefore gaseous ejecta only from massive agb stars can participate secondary star formation within mscs .",
    "it would be reasonable to consider that @xmath28 is @xmath63 that corresponds to @xmath64 yr .",
    "we investigate star formation of gaseous ejecta from fg agb stars in mscs with @xmath0 ranging from @xmath65 to @xmath66 by using the latest version of grape ( gravity pipe , grape-7 ) which is the special - purpose computer for gravitational dynamics ( sugimoto et al .",
    "we have revised our original grape - sph code ( bekki 2009 ) so that we can investigate star formation processes within the above - mentioned massive stellar system .",
    "mscs with very large ( @xmath67 ) are still referred to as `` clusters '' just for convenience in the present study , though their stellar masses are as massive as those of dwarf galaxies    we focus mainly on _ secondary star formation _ from agb ejecta of fg stars within original mscs and describe the results of numerical simulations on the star formation .",
    "we have numerically investigated ram pressure stripping of agb ejecta by ism of their hosts and its strength dependent on @xmath0 and physical parameters of ism .",
    "we however describe the results in our forthcoming papers ( bekki et al .",
    "2010 ) , because ram pressure stripping of agb ejecta of mscs by typical ism of hosts is only effective for low - mass mscs with @xmath68 , ( which can not become ordinary gcs in the present study ) and thus not so important .",
    "we have numerically investigated accretion of warm ism onto mscs by bondi accretion and found that bondi accretion with the accretion rate of @xmath69 yr@xmath21 is possible only if @xmath0 is larger than @xmath70 for typical ism with @xmath71 atom @xmath72 , relative velocity of @xmath73 km s@xmath21 , and gas temperature of 10000 k. although this accretion rate is too small for mscs to obtain fresh gas for the formation of sg stars within @xmath23 yr , this bondi accretion can be an important mechanism for obtaining fresh gas in massive gcs with abundance variations in heavy elements like @xmath74 cen , as briefly discussed later in this paper .",
    "we will describe the details of the numerical results on bondi accretion of ism in our forthcoming papers ( bekki et al .",
    "2010 ) , mainly because this paper becomes too long if the results are included in this paper .",
    "the original mscs are assumed to have a plummer density profile ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) with luminosities ( @xmath75 ) and central velocity dispersions ( @xmath76 ) consistent with the relation observed for gcs ( djorgovski et al .",

    "( 2005 ) revealed that massive stellar systems with masses larger than @xmath87 appear to have scaling regions different from those of the present gcs .",

    "although we adopt this @xmath123 for most models , we investigate models with different @xmath105 so that we can find a threshold @xmath105 for a given msc above which secondary star formation can occur in the msc .",
    "it is found that if @xmath105 is larger than 0.008 , secondary star formation is possible in some models , though the star formation efficiency is low .",
    "this means that secondary star formation within a msc can not be possible until a certain amount of gas is accumulated within the msc and thus that there should be a time - delay between the formation of fg stars and that of sg ones .",
    "we investigate whether the gas accumulated in the central regions of mscs can be sufficient to form new stars by adopting a simple prescription for star formation . in the models with `` star formation '' ,",
    "a gas particle is converted into a collision - less new stellar one if the gas particle meets the following three conditions : ( i ) the dynamical time scale of the sph gas particle is shorter than the sound crossing time , ( ii ) the gas is converging ( i.e. , @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the velocity vector of the gas particle ) , and ( iii ) the local gas density exceeds a threshold gas density ( @xmath126 ) which corresponds to the densities of dense cores of molecular clouds ( @xmath127 atoms @xmath72 ) , where individual star formation is ongoing .",
    "the first two conditions mimic the jeans gravitational instability for gaseous collapse .",

    "we assume that @xmath147 for most models except those for investigating how agb ejecta can be retained within mscs .",

    "we describe in detail only the results of some representative models showing key parameter - dependences in retention processes of agb ejecta and secondary star formation processes within clusters among the investigated models .",
    "secondary star formation processes can continue only for @xmath130 yr so that they can not be strongly influenced by gravitational fields of their hosts unless mscs are located in the very centers of their hosts .",
    "we thus show mainly the results for models without gravitational fields of hosts in order to much more clearly show the importance of the four key parameters @xmath0 , @xmath18 , @xmath93 , and @xmath126 in secondary star formation processes .",
    "as described in  3.2 , we do not consider that different agb stars with different masses eject gas at different @xmath151 owing to different lifetimes of the stars .",
    "therefore all of the gaseous ejecta can be converted into new stars within @xmath152 myr .",
    "this rapid consumption of the agb ejecta is not so realistic , given that there should be at least several tens millions years time delay between the epochs when agb stars with masses of @xmath153 and @xmath57 start to eject their gas .",
    "if we consider the different epochs of gas ejection from agb stars with different masses , then the star formation period would become significantly longer",

    "dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) already showed that the cumulative effect of numerous sn ia is important for the star formation processes within massive clusters , because it can drastically alter gas dynamics within the clusters .",
    "therefore the present model that does not include such sn ia effect possibly overestimates the star formation rates in the accumulated agb ejecta in the central regions of mscs .",
    "our future more sophisticated models with sn ia effect will discuss how sn ia can influence gas dynamics and star formation in mscs .",
    "fig . 2 show that time evolution of spatial distributions of agb ejecta is very different between models with @xmath154 and @xmath155 in which model parameters except @xmath0 are exactly the same .",
    "gaseous particles with @xmath156 ejected from an agb star locating in the very center of a msc can expand quickly ( @xmath157myr ) and finally escape from the cluster and never return back in the model with @xmath154 ( @xmath158myr ) .",
    "on the other hand , gaseous ejecta from an agb star in the model with @xmath155 can return back to the initial location within a timescale of a few myr after the ejection owing to the deeper gravitational potential for this more massive cluster .",
    "this clear difference suggests that @xmath0 is an important parameter for determining whether agb ejecta can be retained in mscs during their early formation phases .",
    "3 shows how the mass fractions of agb ejecta retained within mscs ( @xmath159 ) depend on @xmath0 .",
    "3 shows that mscs with @xmath160 can retain a significant fraction of agb ejecta if a scaling - relation similar to the observed one is applied for all mscs .",
    "this result implies that there can be a threshold mass above which agb ejecta can be efficiently retained .",
    "for mscs with @xmath161 , agb ejecta initially in the outer part of the msc can escape from the msc whereas that initially in the inner part can be retained within the msc . as a result of this , a `` core - halo '' structure of agb ejecta can be formed within 13.6 myr . a very compact gas sphere can be formed where star formation would be able to proceed rapidly if star formation is included in the model with @xmath162",
    ". a larger fraction of agb ejecta can be retained in mscs with larger @xmath0 .",
    "gaseous spheres composed of agb ejecta can interact with one another within a msc when numerous stars enter into agb phase almost simultaneously .",
    "the present 3d numerical simulations enable us to investigate whether and how hydrodynamical interaction between the gaseous spheres increase or decrease the total gas mass accumulated within the central region of the msc .",
    "4 shows that if two agb stars with each having @xmath156 are included in the model with @xmath163 ( where no gas accumulation is seen in fig .",
    "2 ) , the gas can lose kinetic energy owing to energy dissipation during hydrodynamical interaction of the gaseous spheres so that a non - negligible amount of gas can be accumulated within the cluster .",
    "about 3.6% of the initial agb ejecta can be accumulated within the central 50pc of the cluster within 13.6 myr .",
    "5 shows how @xmath164 , where @xmath103 are the total numbers of agb stars , depends on @xmath103 : this normalized @xmath165 can measure the efficiency of retaining agb ejecta within mscs .",
    "it is clear from this figure that agb ejecta can be more efficiently retained within clusters for models with larger @xmath103 .",
    "this is mainly because as the larger number of gaseous spheres ( of agb stars ) hydrodynamically interact with one another , the larger amount of the gas can lose their kinetic energy to be accreted onto the central regions of mscs .",
    "the results in figs . 4 and 5 therefore demonstrate that hydrodynamical interaction of agb ejecta can cause efficient gaseous dissipation and thus play a great role in retaining agb ejecta within mscs .",
    "6 shows that ( i ) there is a threshold @xmath0 ( @xmath166 in this parameter study ) above which agb ejecta can be retained effectively and ( ii ) @xmath167 is larger for larger @xmath0 .",
    "the reason of these dependences is that mscs with larger @xmath0 have deeper gravitational potentials so that they can retain agb ejecta more effectively .",
    "differences in @xmath165 between @xmath168pc and @xmath169pc are small for models with @xmath170 , which means that most the accumulated gas can form very compact gaseous regions within the central regions of mscs . thus mscs with larger @xmath0 can obtain a larger amount of agb ejecta for further star formation : @xmath0 is a key for determining whether mscs can have sg stars .",
    "7 shows how gas ejected from agb stars is accumulated within the central region of a msc and consequently converted into new stars ( i.e. , sg ones ) there within 13.6 myr in the standard model with @xmath143 , @xmath144pc , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 atoms @xmath72 .",
    "the gaseous ejecta from agb stars initially located in the central region of the msc can be accumulated there within @xmath62myr so that star formation can start efficiently .",
    "the star formation from agb ejecta can proceed like a `` starburst '' with most gas being consumed rapidly within the first 3 myr evolution of the msc .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) reaches its maximum value ( @xmath171 yr@xmath21 ) at @xmath172 myr and then rapidly declines to be @xmath173 yr@xmath21 ) at @xmath174 myr .",
    "about 86% of the gas can be converted into new stars within 13.6 myr in this model .",
    "this very high star formation efficiency ( @xmath25 ) results from the fact that almost all of the agb ejecta can be accumulated very quickly ( in less than a few @xmath175 yr ) within the central region of the msc owing to the deep gravitational potential and consequently converted into new stars there .",
    "the accumulated gas is strongly self - gravitating ( i.e. , gas mass comparable to stellar mass there ) in the central region of the cluster so that the gas can continue to collapse to form new stars .",
    "this result clearly suggests that _ secondary star formation within mscs _ is responsible for the origin of the observed high stellar densities of the present gcs : a gmc can not be converted into a gc just by one star - formation event .",
    "a new compact star cluster embedded in low - density residual gas can be formed in the central regions of the msc within 13.6 myr in this model .",
    "owing to the high star formation efficiency ( @xmath176 ) , the new cluster is highly likely to survive from gas removal by energetic winds of massive stars and supernova explosion . as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the new cluster is much more compact than the original msc and has a half - mass radius ( @xmath177pc ) significantly smaller than that of the original msc ( @xmath178pc ) . owing to its compactness",
    ", the new cluster is much less susceptible to tidal destruction by its host galaxy .",
    "thus a `` nested stellar system '' composed of a diffuse original cluster ( fg stars ) and a compact new one ( sg ones ) can be formed as a result of secondary star formation from agb ejecta within the msc in this model .",
    "this nested structure is one of common features of the simulated mscs in the present study .",
    "fig.9 shows how the fractions ( @xmath179 ) of the total mass of new stars ( @xmath180 ) to the initial total mass of the msc ( @xmath0 ) depend on @xmath0 for @xmath168pc and @xmath169pc in the models with @xmath146 atoms @xmath72 .",
    "clearly there is a threshold cluster mass ( @xmath1 ) above which secondary star formation is possible : @xmath181 and does not depend on @xmath126 in the present study .",
    "furthermore , @xmath179 is higher in mscs with larger @xmath0 , which implies that @xmath25 is also higher in mscs with larger @xmath0 .",
    "almost all stars can be formed within half - mass radii ( @xmath152pc ) of mscs with @xmath182 so that there can be no differences between @xmath179 for @xmath168pc and @xmath169pc .",
    "although @xmath25 is rather high ( 0.86 ) in the model shown in figs . 7 and 8 , the total mass of new stars can be at most @xmath183 owing to the adopted @xmath123 that is reasonable for the standard imf .",
    "this means that mscs with @xmath184 can become low - mass gcs with multiple stellar populations .",
    "furthermore , @xmath25 is 0.3 for the model with @xmath185 , which suggests that the new cluster can significantly expand after gas expulsion due to energetic winds of massive stars and supernova .",
    "the cluster is likely to become a low - mass , low - density gc with a smaller fraction of sg stars ( like pal 5 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath0 implies that more massive gcs have larger fractions of sg stars .",
    "the details of star formation histories depend weakly on @xmath93 and @xmath126 such that gas can be more rapidly converted into new stars in mscs with smaller @xmath93 and @xmath126 .",
    "10 shows that overall star formation rate is higher in the model with @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) than in that with @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "this is mainly because initial angular momentum of the msc in the model with @xmath188 can suppress the formation of a very compact gaseous region in the center of the msc .",
    "the secondary peak of the star formation rate in the model with @xmath188 at @xmath190 myr is due to later infall of gas onto the msc s center where a compact gas disk is formed .",
    "the formation of nested structures with very compact new clusters and initially more diffuse old ones is one of essential ingredients of the present simulations .",
    "11 , which shows a typical example of the nested structures , describes how the total stellar mass within @xmath94 depend on @xmath94 for old and new stars in the standard model .",
    "clearly the final cluster is dominated by new stars ( sg ) within @xmath191pc , and the faction ( @xmath192 ) of the total mass of new stars ( @xmath193 ) to the total mass of old stars ( @xmath194 ) and new ones is more than 0.5 for @xmath191pc . fig .",

    "@xmath0 should be at least @xmath196 to explain gcs with @xmath197 ( for @xmath123 ) .",
    "given that @xmath25 is not 1 ( @xmath4 for most models ) and later dynamical evolution can reduce the total masses of mscs , stellar structures and kinematics of the simulated mscs with rather large @xmath0 ( @xmath198 ) can correspond to those of the observed ones of gcs with masses larger than @xmath142 .",

    "this significantly flattened shape can be seen in new stars for most models in which @xmath93 is not 0 ( i.e. , even the models with @xmath200 show such flattened shapes ) .    the total mass of new stars ( @xmath193 ) is larger than @xmath201 and the effective radius ( @xmath202 ) of the stars is 5.2pc , which is about a factor of 5 smaller than that of the old ones ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "the half - mass ratios ( @xmath204 ) are very similar ( @xmath205 ) in the present models with different model parameters . as shown in fig .",

    "it is confirmed that more massive models with @xmath207 with different @xmath93 and @xmath126 also show distinct nested structures .",
    "15 shows clear differences in stellar kinematics between old and new stars ( thus fg and sg ones , respectively ) in the final msc for the model .",
    "new stars clearly have rotational kinematics with the maximum rotational velocity ( @xmath208 ) of 12.0 km s@xmath21 and the smaller central velocity dispersion ( @xmath209 ) of 9.5 km s@xmath21 , which means @xmath210 .",
    "this rotational kinematics can not be seen in old stars , which have @xmath211 in this model .",
    "the models with larger @xmath93 show larger @xmath212 in new stars , which has already been discussed by bekki ( 2010 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the present gcs originate from mscs composed of two stellar populations with significantly different kinematics .",
    "16 shows the time evolution of the projected spatial distribution of agb ejecta for a nuclear msc in the model without star formation yet with the external gravitational field of its host galaxy dominated by dark matter halo ( @xmath136 ) . in this model ,",

    "17 shows that @xmath165 in the models with external gravitational fields of hosts do not depend so strongly on @xmath0 as those without the fields do : irrespective of @xmath0 , most of agb ejecta can be retained within the central 50pc of mscs in the models with external gravitational fields of their host owing to their much deeper gravitational potential wells .",

    "this results indicates that inner gas densities ( @xmath168pc ) can not be so high in nuclear mscs with lower @xmath0 so that star formation can not occur efficiently in the mscs .",
    "it is actually confirmed that star formation can not occur efficiently in the low - mass models with @xmath216 , even if external gravitational fields are included .",
    "thus the original masses of nuclear mscs are still important for secondary star formation processes even if they are located in nuclear regions of their host galaxies",

    "star formation can start earlier and proceed more efficiently in the model with the external gravitational field ( @xmath219 ) than in the model without ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "these differences between two models with and without external gravitational fields are less remarkable for high - mass and high - density mscs , where star formation can proceed efficiently even in isolation .",
    "in the present scenario , original mscs need to keep substantial masses at least for @xmath23 yr after they form within gmcs so that gaseous ejecta from more massive agb stars can be retained in mscs and finally converted into new stars ( = sg ones ) .",
    "the hosts ( = massive dwarfs ) can strip stars from mscs owing to their tidal fields , even if the fields are not so strong as that of the galaxy .",
    "therefore we here investigate how long mscs can keep their substantial fractions of stars when they are under strong gravitational influences of their hosts .",
    "we consider how a msc dynamically evolves after most of residual gas left behind from the formation of fg stars are expelled from the cluster through supernova events .",
    "accordingly we adopt an assumption that ( i ) the msc is assumed to consists purely of stellar particles and ( ii ) it is not necessarily in virial equilibrium owing to loss of the original mass of the gmc . the cluster with a mass @xmath0 and a size @xmath18 has a plummer density profile with the scale length @xmath79 ( @xmath86 ) .",

    "mscs with @xmath11 can not lose more than 50% of their original stellar masses within @xmath62 gyr so that agb ejecta can be retained within the mscs and converted into new stars .",
    "these results imply that original masses of the present gcs with multiple stellar populations should be rather large to keep substantial fractions of their original stellar masses to be immune from tidal destruction by their host within @xmath253 gyr .",
    "initial densities of mscs and @xmath224 also can determine @xmath254 for a given set of parameters @xmath0 , @xmath222 , @xmath15 , @xmath134 , and @xmath238 .",
    "mscs with lower densities and smaller @xmath224 are more susceptible to tidal destruction of their hosts so that they can lose more stars within 1 gyr ( i.e. , larger @xmath254 ) .",
    "thus the time evolution of stellar masses of mscs depends strongly on a number of parameters ( e.g. , @xmath0 and @xmath222 ) so that the time scale within which gaseous ejecta from agb stars can be retained and converted into new stars can also depend on the parameters .",
    "the present parameter study , however , indicates that original mscs are unlikely to be destroyed completely within a timescale of @xmath23 yr for most models : most mscs can slowly ( @xmath61 gyr ) disintegrate owing to the strong tidal fields of their hosts .",
    "we thus suggest that secondary star formation from agb ejecta within mscs is highly likely for most mscs with @xmath255 and can last at least @xmath23 yr .",
    "we have shown that @xmath0 can determine whether agb ejecta from fg stars of mscs can be retained within the mscs and consequently converted into new stars efficiently .",
    "22 briefly summarizes the present key results on how @xmath0 controles @xmath25 for the secondary star formation . mscs with larger @xmath0 can have higher @xmath25 and we have confirmed that his dependence does not depend on @xmath93 and @xmath126 .",
    "mscs with more rotation in fg stars are more likely to show smaller @xmath25 .",
    "secondary star formation is possible if @xmath0 is larger than @xmath256 , though @xmath25 is not so high . as long as @xmath257 , @xmath25 can be larger than 0.5 so that new compact clusters , which would not disintegrate even after gas expulsion , can form within old clusters .",
    "thus our results have shown that there can be a threshold cluster mass ( @xmath258 \\times 10 ^ 5 { \\rm m}_{\\odot}$ ] ) above which secondary star formation with high @xmath25 can occur within original clusters .",
    "this @xmath259 can be as low as @xmath260 , if the original clusters are @xmath152 times more compact than the scaling - relations described by the equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) imply .",
    "however @xmath25 is at most 0.1 even for such compact clusters with lower masses . on the other hand ,",
    "even if mscs with @xmath261 are @xmath262 times more diffuse than the scaling - relations described by the equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) imply , their @xmath25 can be as large as 0.1 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to claim that @xmath1 is @xmath263 .",
    "dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that secondary star formation within original clusters is possible for @xmath11 but not for @xmath143 .",
    "this implies that @xmath1 can be somewhere between @xmath264 and @xmath14 and is significantly larger than the derived @xmath1 in the present study .",
    "this is mainly because modeling of star formation and treatment of agb ejecta are different between these two works . both models in dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and the present study have advantages and disadvantages in describing evolution of agb ejecta within clusters .",
    "for example , the present model enables us to investigate self - consistently 3d hydrodynamical interaction of numerous gaseous spheres from agb stars whereas the model by dercole investigated cooling of initially warm agb ejecta self - consistently .",
    "more sophisticated models in our future papers need to investigate @xmath1 in a fully self - consistent manner by including physical effects that are treated by the present model in a simple way .",
    "we here discuss how @xmath0 determines nature of multiple stellar populations in gcs owing to existence of @xmath1 .",
    "we propose that @xmath0 is one of key parameters which can determine differences in ages and various chemical abundances of light and heavy ones between multiple stellar populations .",
    "based on the present numerical results , we divide mscs into the following categories according to their @xmath0 .",
    "it should be stressed here that @xmath0 for a cluster is not the present mass ( @xmath12 ) but its original one .",
    "these low - mass clusters can neither retain agb ejecta nor convert gas into new stars owing to their shallow gravitational potential wells .",
    "therefore these clusters are highly unlikely to show abundance spread even in light elements .",
    "observations showed that the galactic open cluster ( ocs ) show unimodal distributions of cn band strength ( martell & smith 2009 ) and do not have abundance spread in light elements ( e.g. , carretta et al . 2007 ) and o - na anti - correlation ( de silva et al .",
    "these low - mass clusters can be easily destroyed by interaction with gmcs ( e.g. , gieles et al .",
    "2006 ) so that they can not obtain fresh cold gas for further star formation .",
    "the observed low - mass ocs in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds belong to this class .",
    "these clusters can not retain agb ejecta efficiently within their central regions so that secondary star formation can not occur .",
    "however , they can obtain fresh cold gas for further star formation by capture and accretion of cold molecular gas that are either those left behind from previous star formation events or those located close to them ( e.g. , bekki & mackey 2009 ) .",
    "therefore , if secondary star formation occurs within these clusters , they can only show multiple stellar populations with age differences yet no / little abundance spread even in light elements .",
    "the intermediate - age clusters in the lmc and the smc belong to this class .      clusters with this mass range can retain most of their agb ejecta within the central regions but can not convert the stars so efficiently ( @xmath268 ) into new stars within a short time scale ( @xmath269 ) yr . although dynamical fate of the accumulated agb ejecta for the cluster remains unclear , `` triggering mechanisms '' such as cluster mergers ( or initially very high - density clusters ) would be necessary to convert the gas so efficiently into new stars .",
    "strong ram pressure stripping of the gas by ism of their host galaxies could remove the gas from the clusters .",
    "the ordinary galactic gcs with abundance spread in light elements can originate from clusters with this mass range , because agb ejecta can be retained in the clusters and converted into new stars very efficiently ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "the mass fraction of sg stars in a present gc depends mainly on @xmath0 and dynamical evolution of its original cluster ( i.e. , destruction by its host and long - term evolution driven by two - body relaxation ) .",
    "if these massive clusters are initially stellar nuclei of massive dwarf galaxies , then agb ejecta from sg stars can be converted into new stars ( i.e. , the formation of third generation of stars ) .",
    "this sequential formation of stars in the nuclear regions of hosts can continue until the hosts are destroyed by much larger galaxies .",
    "very massive clusters with this mass range are progenitors of the present massive gcs with masses larger than @xmath264 .",
    "stellar systems with @xmath273 would be dwarf galaxies themselves rather than clusters , and therefore at least some fraction of massive gcs ( e.g. , @xmath74 cen and g1 ) may well the remnants of nucleated dwarf galaxies .",
    "owing to much deeper gravitational potential wells of nucleated dwarfs , not only agb ejecta but also gas from more energetic massive stars and supernova would be able to be retained and finally converted into new stars .",
    "thus such massive gcs can show abundance spread in both light and heavy elements .        using analytical models , pflamm - altenburg & kroupa ( 2009 )",
    "recently have shown that if the mass of a cluster exceeds a threshold mass ( @xmath274 ) , then the cluster can obtain a significant amount of warm ism from outside the cluster by bondi accretion within a reasonable time scale ( i.e. , a few gyr ) .",
    "we have confirmed their results using 3d hydrodynamical simulations , though the threshold mass for gas accretion is larger ( @xmath275 ) in our estimation ( bekki et al .",
    "we suggest that although secondary formation from mixed gas of agb ejecta and the accumulated ism by bondi accretion would be reasonable for massive gcs with possible age differences ( like @xmath74 cen ) , such star formation has the following potentially serious problems in explaining chemical abundances of _ ordinary _ galactic gc .",
    "firstly , if original clusters are within galaxies , then they can obtain gas initially located in different regions with possible different chemical abundances ( owing to radial and azimuthal abundance gradients with the galaxies ) thus are highly likely to have gas and new stars with different [ fe / h ] .",
    "therefore , only a minor fraction of the galactic gcs may well have sg stars formed from mixed gas of agb ejecta and ism obtained by bondi accretion .",
    "secondly , the bondi accretion rate is too small ( @xmath276 yr@xmath21 for @xmath277 ) for typical ism so that an enough amount of sg stars can not form from gas chemically polluted only by massive agb stars ( @xmath278 ) within an order of @xmath90 yr .",
    "it is possible that if densities of warm ism are as large as @xmath279 atoms @xmath72 , then clusters would be able to obtain an enough amount of gas within a timescale of less than @xmath90 yr ( but if this is the case , then such high - density gas may well be cold molecular clouds rather than warm ism ) .",
    "thirdly , even if warm ism with initial temperature of @xmath280k can be accreted by clusters , further efficient radiative cooling ( to 10 - 100k ) within a short timescale ( @xmath269 yr ) is required for further star formation .",
    "our previous and present study have not yet investigated how warm ism and agb ejecta mixed with and consequently convert into cold molecular gas for further star formation using a sophisticated model , and accordingly we can not currently discuss the possibility of secondary star formation from the accumulated warm ism .",
    "our future more sophisticated models will investigate whether these three are really serious problems .",
    "it is possible that the original mscs would have a plenty of cold molecular gas left behind from the formation of fg stars , because the star formation efficiencies are highly likely to be well less than 100% . given that gmcs which are progenitors of fg stars should be very massive ( @xmath281 ) in the present scenario , then the host gmcs would have numerous substructures ( i.e. , smaller molecular clouds ) that remains intact even after the formation of fg stars .",
    "these molecular clouds can be captured by or accreted onto mscs , as a previous simulation demonstrated already ( bekki & mackey 2009 ) . owing to initially low temperatures of the captured cold gas , star formation from gas mixed between agb ejecta and the captured gas",
    "would proceed efficiently .",
    "a potential problem of this process is that it remain unclear whether cold molecular clouds left behind the formation of fg stars can really keep the same abundances as those of fg stars ( i.e. , remain `` pristine '' ) without being chemically polluted by massive stars and supernova of fg stars .",
    "a significant fraction of the residual cold gas would be heated up to become high - temperature and low - density warm and hot gas so that they can not be captured later by mscs owing to their high - temperature and low - density .",
    "owing to clumpy structures of the original massive gmcs , a significant amount of energy from massive stars and supernova can be expelled from low - density inter - substructure regions of the gmcs toward the halos of their hosts .",
    "some smaller cold molecular clouds that can survive from thermal and kinetic feedback effects of energetic stars would be able to be captured later by mscs and consequently mixed with agb ejecta .",
    "the above processes of mixing of cold molecular gas and agb ejecta have not been investigated in detail by any previous 3d hydrodynamical simulations of star - forming gmcs .",
    "bekki & chiba ( 2007 ) investigated ( i ) how massive stars and type ii supernova influence gas dynamics within star - forming gmcs and ( ii ) chemical abundances of gas left behind from star formation .",
    "they however did not include ejection of gas so that they could not investigate how agb ejecta mixed with the residual gas to form new stars .",
    "it is thus doubtlessly worthwhile for our future more sophisticated models to investigate whether and what fraction of residual molecular cloud left behind from the formation of fg stars can be converted into new stars without being chemically polluted by massive fg stars .",
    "a number of recent observational studies have found that a significant fraction of intermediate - age cluster in the lmc and the smc show double main sequence turnoffs ( hereafter referred to as dmstos for convenience ) on their color magnitude diagrams ( mackey & broby nielsen 2007 ; mackey et al .",
    "2008 ; glatt et al .",
    "2008 ; goudfrooij et al .",
    "2009 ; milone et al .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the observed dmstos in each of these clusters represent two distinct stellar populations with differences in age of @xmath282 myr .",
    "recently bastian & de mink ( 2009 ) have proposed that stellar rotation in stars with masses between 1.2 and 1.7@xmath283 can mimic the effects of dmstos without resorting to age differences between stellar populations within clusters of the magellanic clouds .",
    "however , the presence of a dual red clump of giant stars in the color magnitude diagram of ngc 419 in the smc is suggested to be inconsistent with the claim by bastian & de mink ( 2009 ) but be explained naturally by the presence of multiple star - formation episodes ( rubele et al .",

    "however , mucciarelli et al . ( 2009 ) revealed significant abundance inhomogeneities in [ na / fe ] , [ al / fe ] , [ o / fe ] , and [ mg / fe ] and o - na and mg - al anti - correlations in old gcs ( @xmath284 gyr ) .",
    "these observations imply that intermediate - age clusters have ( at least ) two generations of stars with different ages yet similar chemical abundances whereas old ones are like the galactic gcs with abundance spread in light elements . therefore",
    ", any theory of gc formation need to explain why the lmc appears to have two different types of gcs with multiple stellar populations .",

    "the results by bekki & mackey ( 2009 ) and the present study therefore combine to suggest that if the observed dmstos in clusters of the lmc are due to age differences of stellar populations , then the two populations are highly unlikely to show abundance spread in light elements owing to their low masses ( @xmath286 ) .",

    "( 2008 , 2009 ) strongly suggest that the threshold cluster mass ( @xmath1 ) for secondary star formation from agb ejecta mixed with pristine gas would be much more than @xmath201 .",

    "given the possible substructures within host gmcs for fg stars , the original stellar systems can be still clusters of smaller clusters when fg agb stars to eject their gaseous winds",

    "stellar nuclei are dominated by sg stars that can be formed more quickly from agb ejecta of fg ones owing to much deeper gravitational potentials of their host with dark matter halos .",

    "future observations on chemical abundances of stars in nuclei of the sagittarius dwarf and ngc 205 will enable us to discuss whether this scenario is physically viable .        the present simulations have shown that secondary star formation from agb ejecta can occur at the central regions of original clusters , where mean stellar number densities exceed @xmath293 stars pc@xmath294 ( for @xmath143 ) .",
    "recently krumholz et al .",
    "( 2009 ) investigated formation of massive stars by gaseous accretion within a gas cloud with a mass of @xmath295 and a size of 0.1 pc and found that two ( binary ) stars with masses of @xmath296 and @xmath297 can be formed within @xmath298 years . therefore the present simulations imply that gas clouds for massive stars ( as those investigated by krumholz et al .",
    "2009 above ) can interact frequently with stars within the central regions of a dense stellar system owing to the small mean separation of stars ( @xmath205 pc ) and the short dynamical time scale ( @xmath299 yr ) .",
    "it would be accordingly possible that massive star formation is severely suppressed owing to this star - cloud interaction which can prevent gas accretion onto clouds forming massive stars : imfs for the formation of sg stars within mscs would be bottom - heavy . if formation of binary star - forming gas clouds , which are progenitors of binary stars , can be also prevented owing to star - cloud interaction , then the observed small binary fractions among sg stars in gcs ( dorazi et al .",
    "2010b ) can be naturally explained .",
    "if only sg stars have a bottom - heavy imf with the power - law slope of @xmath300 with fg ones with @xmath301 , then the number fraction of low - mass stars with masses lower than @xmath302 for sg stars to that for fg ones is 1.7 for @xmath303 .",
    "this number fraction can become as large as 2 by assuming unrealistically low @xmath39 ( @xmath304 ) and steeper @xmath33 ( @xmath305 ) .",
    "therefore , if imfs can be bottom - heavy only for sg stars , then the required original masses of clusters that finally become the present gcs can be up to by a factor of 2 smaller than those derived in the present work with the standard imf both for fg and sg stars .",
    "thus , the possible bottom - heavy imf can not change the present main conclusion that the progenitor clusters of the present gcs are much more massive than the present gcs .",
    "previous works discussed the origin of shapes and rotation ( e.g. , frenk & fall 1982 ; einsel & spurzem 1999 ) , sizes and luminosities ( e.g. , murray 2009 ) , scaling - relations ( e.g. , djorgovski 1993 ; bekki et al .",

    "they accordingly did not discuss the origin of gc properties in the context of initially nested structures and ignored the importance of gas dynamics in the formation of gc properties .",
    "if most gcs really originate from nested stellar systems , then conclusions of the above previous works based on models with `` non - nested '' stellar structures must be dramatically modified .",
    "thus it would be reasonable to say that the above conclusions can apply only for low - mass clusters with single stellar population and no nested structures .",
    "bekki ( 2010 ) recently has shown that the origin of the observed rotation in gcs ( e.g. , meylan & mayor 1986 ; meylan & heggie 1997 ; anderson & king 2003 ) can be closely associated with dissipative gas dynamics of agb ejecta from fg stars within forming gcs . given the observed large mass fractions of sg stars in the present gcs ( e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "2010 ) , gas dynamics of agb ejecta within original clusters composed only of fg stars may well be a key determinant for structure and kinematics of the present gcs .",
    "although recent numerical simulations have investigated long - term dynamical evolution of gcs with initially nested stellar structures ( e.g. , decressin et al .",
    "2008 ; dercole et al .",

    "our future long - term ( @xmath284 gyr ) dynamical simulations of gcs based on structures and kinematics of gcs with nested stellar structures , flattened 3d distributions , and rotation simulated in the present study will enable us to discuss structure and kinematics in a consistent manner .",
    "recently vink et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have found two stellar populations with younger and older ones with ages of @xmath306 myr and @xmath307 myr , respectively , in the young , massive stellar cluster sandage-96 in a spiral arm of ngc 2403 .",
    "given the observed possible large age difference ( up to @xmath7 myr ) , this type of young massive clusters can be the candidates that are now forming or have just formed sg stars from agb ejecta from fg ones .",
    "vink et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also have found that the younger population are located closer to the center of the cluster in comparison with the older one .",
    "if the cluster has a mass as large as @xmath264 , the observation would be consistent with the present results on the nested structure of mscs , though quantitative comparison ( i.e. , the mass - ratio and the half - mass - radius - ratio of the two populations ) with the present results is not currently possible .",
    "the present study suggests that if the total mass of the cluster is as large as @xmath264 , the redder colors in the younger population of the cluster can be due to gas and dust that now surrounds the younger population and were previous ejected from the older one .",
    "if future observations find young clusters with large masses ( @xmath308 ) and two populations with the age differences as large as @xmath90 yr in actively star - forming galaxies , they can be forming gcs with nested structures and thus provide strong constraints on the formation models of gcs like the present one .",
    "as suggested above , new compact clusters can be shrouded by gas and dust left behind from the formation of sg stars until supernova events expel the gas and dust : the dust - shrouded new clusters would have very red color for their young ages and possibly they can not be even seen in optical bands if dust extinction is so heavy . if fg stars can not be clearly identified as compact clusters owing to their initially more diffuse distributions , then dust - shrouded new clusters within the fg stars might well be identified as giant hii regions with no optical counterparts .",
    "however it is not clear whether the observed giant hii regions with no near - infrared cluster counterparts in starbursting luminous infrared galaxies with numerous super - star clusters ( e.g. , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2002 ) can be dust - obscured very young compact clusters ( sg ) embedded in older ones ( fg ) .",
    "massive stellar systems with masses of @xmath291 were discovered in ultra - luminous infrared - galaxies with dust - shrouded strong starbursts ( e.g. , monreal - ibero et al .",

    "the present sutdy has shown that mscs with @xmath11 and ages of less than 1 gyr ( before destruction of the old clusters ) can have nested steller structurs .",
    "these results combine to imply that young gcs with nested structures are highly likely to exist in e+a galaxies .",
    "it is thus worthwhile for future observational studies to search for massive young clusters in e+a galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 5102 ) to provide a clue to the origin of multiple stellar populations of gcs .",
    "we have performed 3d numerical simulations of star formation from agb ejecta in mscs formed from gmcs within their host galactic building blocks . we have considered that stars initially in mscs and those newly formed from agb ejecta corresponds to fg and sg stars , respectively , in the present gcs and thus discussed the origin of multiple stellar populations of gcs .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) gaseous ejecta from agb stars can be retained within mscs with @xmath0 larger than @xmath310 , if mscs are isolated ( i.e. , not being influenced by ram pressure of ism ) .",
    "the mass fraction of gas retained in a msc to @xmath0 ( @xmath165 ) depends on @xmath0 such that @xmath165 is larger in larger @xmath0 .",
    "the multiple hydrodynamical interaction of gaseous ejecta from numerous agb stars can significantly increase gas mass accumulated within the central regions of mscs , which was first found by the present study .",
    "\\(2 ) if @xmath0 of mscs exceed a threshold cluster mass @xmath1 , gaseous ejecta of agb stars can sink into the central regions and then form high - density gaseous regions so that new stars ( i.e. , sg stars ) can be formed there with high star formation efficiencies ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xmath1 is demonstrated to be @xmath263 in the present study .",
    "deep gravitational potentials of mscs play a great role both in retaining the accreting agb ejecta onto the central regions and in forming high - density gaseous regions there .",
    "therefore secondary star formation within clusters is inevitable in mscs with @xmath0 larger than @xmath1 .",
    "owing to the existence of @xmath1 , young open clusters and super star clusters with @xmath311 can not evolve into stellar systems with abundance spread in light elements .",
    "\\(3 ) owing to the high star formation efficiencies ( @xmath312 ) , very compact stellar systems can be formed from agb ejecta within a time scale of @xmath130 yr ( after massive agb stars start to eject their winds ) .",
    "the half - mass radius of a new compact cluster is by a factor of 5 smaller than that of the old one for most models in the present study .",
    "the nested clusters ( or `` cluster within cluster '' ) with more diffuse old cluster and very compact new one are characteristic for the present numerical models .",
    "\\(4 ) at most @xmath6% of all stars can be from new stars formed from agb ejecta for the canonical imfs in the present study .",
    "therefore , in order to explain the present total mass of sg stars with masses of @xmath142 in a gc , @xmath0 is required to be as large as @xmath313 .",
    "the required mass for the progenitor msc for @xmath74 cen can be as large as @xmath66 owing to its larger present mass . given that @xmath314 for secondary star formation , the original masses of progenitors ( @xmath0 ) for the present gcs with masses of @xmath12 need to be larger than @xmath315 .",
    "\\(5 ) structural and kinematical properties of new compact clusters formed within original old ones depend on @xmath93 such that new clusters can be more flattened and more strongly supported by rotation in mscs with larger @xmath93 .",
    "the new clusters are much more compact and more strongly supported by rotation than the old ones in all models with initial rotation in old clusters .",
    "these structural and kinematical differences between old and new clusters do not depend on model parameters such as @xmath0 , @xmath18 , and @xmath126 .",
    "given that the present gcs are dominated by sg stars , the result implies that the physical origins of flattened shapes and internal rotation of gcs are closely associated with formation processes of sg stars through gas dynamics within mscs .",
    "\\(6 ) evolution of mscs initially in the very centers of their hosts can be significantly different from that of mscs outside the centers , mainly because agb ejecta can be more effectively retained within nuclear mscs owing to much deeper gravitational potentials of their hosts .",
    "irrespective of @xmath0 , most agb ejecta can be retained in these nuclear mscs .",
    "star formation , however , can proceed within nuclear mscs , only if @xmath0 exceeds a threshold value that is almost the same as @xmath1 described above .",
    "strong gravitational fields of hosts can enhance secondary star formation of nuclear mscs .",
    "multiple episodes of star formation ( i.e. , third and fourth generations of stars ) are possible in nuclear mscs with @xmath3 until their hosts are destroyed during accretion of the hosts on larger galaxies .",
    "the origin of multiple generations of stars observed in @xmath74 cen and ngc 2808 can be closely associated with evolution of nuclear mscs .",
    "\\(7 ) mscs can lose gradually ( @xmath316 gyr ) significant fractions of their stars during dynamical evolution within their hosts owing to tidal stripping by their hosts .",
    "the stripping processes and the timescale depend strongly on @xmath0 , orbits , and initial locations of mscs within hosts . if stars in a msc enter into their agb phases after the msc has lost most of their stars because of tidal stripping , then the agb ejecta can not be efficiently retained in the msc owing to its much shallower gravitational potential .",
    "therefore gaseous ejecta from agb stars with lower masses are less likely to contribute to secondary star formation owing to the destruction of the msc by its host .",
    "thus the destruction of mscs due to their hosts can provide a mechanism by which star formation can be truncated in mscs .",
    "\\(8 ) direct capture and accretion of cold molecular clouds by mscs themselves can be much more efficient ways to dilute the agb ejecta of mscs ( i.e. , mixing of these gaseous components ) in secondary star formation within mscs .",
    "the molecular clouds need to have chemical abundances very similar to those of mscs , and thus they are either ( i ) those that are located very close to mscs or ( ii ) those left behind from the formation of fg stars . the observed hierarchical structures of gmcs are suggested to be responsible for the dilution processes during formation of sg stars .",
    "\\(9 ) low - mass mscs with @xmath317 in the lmc can obtain cold molecular gas by capture of the gas but can not retain agb ejecta owing to much shallower gravitational potentials of mscs .",
    "therefore the intermediate - age clusters with dmstos recently discovered in the magellanic clouds can have multiple stellar populations with age differences yet no abundance spread in light elements owing to their low masses .",
    "the initial masses of the old gcs in the lmc were significantly larger than their present masses of @xmath318 so that they could retain agb ejecta to form sg stars with chemical abundances different from those of fg ones .",
    "\\(10 ) it is suggested that formation of massive stars can be severely suppressed in very dense central regions of mscs ( i.e. , a bottom - heavy imf ) , because dynamical interaction between stars and forming molecular cores ( where individual stars can form ) can prevent the growth of the cores .",
    "if dense stellar systems are really environments within which only low - mass stars can form ( owing to a bottom - heavy imf ) , then the original masses of the present gcs can be to some extent lower than the proposed one ( @xmath319 ) in the present scenario .",
    "+ thus gcs with the observed high central stellar densities ( @xmath280 stars pc@xmath294 ) can not be formed directly from gmcs with single star formation events within gmcs in a scenario explored in the present study .",
    "the origin of the observed high stellar densities of gcs can be associated with unique star formation processes within central regions of already compact stellar systems ( composed of fg stars ) .",
    "the deep gravitational potential wells of original clusters with much lower stellar densities ( @xmath320 stars pc@xmath294 at half - mass radii ) can play a role in enhancing dramatically star formation efficiencies and consequently forming new compact clusters .",
    "the progenitor stellar systems for the present gcs with multiple stellar populations need to be very massive ( @xmath321 ) to retain effectively agb ejecta from fg stars , dilute the gas with cold molecular gas , form new stars from the gas , and finally have the total stellar masses of sg stars similar to the observed ones in the galactic gcs .",
    "the present scenario explains why open clusters in the galaxy and intermediate - age gcs in the lmc do not show clear abundance spread in light elements .",
    "if gcs really originate from mscs with large @xmath0 , then the host gmcs for such mscs should be even more massive ( @xmath322 ) .",
    "we plan to investigate how very massive gmcs can form and evolve into mscs due to efficient star formation within massive dwarf galaxies at high @xmath229 .",
