    "codes @xcite , which have been proven to achieve the symmetric capacity of binary - input discrete memoryless channels under the successive cancellation ( sc ) decoding , is of great interest recently .",

    "simulation results of 8-ary pulse amplitude modulation ( pam ) under sc decoding over additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels show that , the pcm scheme with optimal labeling provides an improvement of about @xmath1db over the bipcm scheme . by utilizing the improved sc decoding techniques @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the proposed pcm scheme can be further improved and outperforms the bit - interleaved turbo coded modulation ( bitcm ) scheme used in wcdma system @xcite by up to 1.5db .",
    "in this paper , we use calligraphic characters , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , to denote sets .",
    "we write the cartesian product of @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xmath4 and the @xmath5-th cartesian power of @xmath2 as @xmath6 .",
    "we use notation @xmath7 to denote an @xmath8-dimensional vector @xmath9 and @xmath10 to denote a subvector @xmath11 of @xmath7 , @xmath12 .",
    "we write to denote a @xmath0-ary input memoryless channel with input alphabet @xmath2 , output alphabet @xmath3 , and transition probabilities @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the number of elements in @xmath2 is @xmath16 .",
    "when the channel @xmath17 is a binary - input memoryless channel ( bmc ) , i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . in @xmath0-ary modulation system , every @xmath20 bits form a vector @xmath21 , and are modulated into a modulation symbol @xmath14 under a one - to - one mapping called _ constellation labeling _ @xmath22 under a certain labeling rule @xmath23 , we abuse notation slightly and use to denote the channel with transition probabilities @xmath24    a pcm transmission scheme under the multi - level coding framework is constructed by a two - step channel transform .",
    "the first step is to transform the @xmath0-ary input channel @xmath17 into @xmath20 synthesized bmcs @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the transition probabilities of @xmath27 are @xmath28 the second step is performing a conventional @xmath8-dimensional channel polarization transform @xmath29 @xcite on each of these @xmath20 bmcs @xmath27 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting bmcs are denoted by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "the bmc @xmath34 with superscript @xmath35 is derived from @xmath27 with @xmath36 , where ceiling function @xmath37 is the smallest integer not less than @xmath38 . after calculating the reliabilities of all the @xmath39 bmcs ,",
    "the @xmath40 most reliable ones are selected to carry the information bits , and others are fixed to frozen bits which is known both to the encoder and the decoder .",
    "the second step of the channel transform can be viewed as constructing a set of polar codes on each of the @xmath20 bmcs in set @xmath41 with a total rate @xmath42 .",
    "a diagram of the channel transform under the pcm scheme is shown in .",
    "given a @xmath0-ary input memoryless channel @xmath17 and a labeling rule @xmath23 , let @xmath43 denote the symmetric capacity , i.e. , the mutual information between the input and output of @xmath17 when the channel input letters are used with equal probability .",
    "the symmetric capacities of @xmath27 can be calculated as @xmath44 after adding up the symmetric capacities @xmath45 for all @xmath46 , a total capacity is obtained @xmath47    equation ( [ equ_sum ] ) is in fact the chain rule of mutual information which reveals the following two facts :    \\1 .",
    "the channel transform from the @xmath0-ary channel @xmath17 to the @xmath20 synthesized bmcs @xmath41 will not bring any ( symmetric ) capacity loss ;    \\2 .",
    "the total capacity is always @xmath43 and not affected by the selection of labeling rules .",
    "however , for the finite - length polar coding , the practical code rate can not achieve the symmetric capacity .",
    "[ fig_iwvsr ] shows the maximum code rate @xmath48 of polar code over binary - input awgn channel when the symmetric capacity @xmath49 takes value in @xmath50 and the block error rate ( bler ) is less than @xmath51 . when the code length takes a practical value and is finite , the gap between the capacity and the maximum achievable code rate @xmath52 differs as @xmath49 changes .",
    "according to ( [ equ_iwj ] ) , although the total capacity is fixed , the distribution of @xmath53 can be adjusted by changing the labeling rule .",
    "therefore , the performance of a practical pcm transmission system can be improved by optimizing the constellation labeling rule .",
    "given a specific labeling rule , the bler performance of a @xmath0-ary pcm scheme over awgn channel can be evaluated using density evolution @xcite .",
    "obviously , a brute - force search for the optimal labeling rule needs @xmath54 tentative constructions of pcm .",
    "the labeling problem can be described in a recursive manner as follows . for a @xmath0-ary labeling problem with @xmath55 , half of the @xmath0 modulation symbols",
    "are selected from @xmath2 and these symbols are corresponding to vectors @xmath56 with @xmath57 , and the others with @xmath58 .",
    "the number of possible selections is @xmath59 .",
    "then , the problem is degraded to labeling two component constellations .",
    "the component constellations are usually non - uniform and with a dc ( direct current ) bias .",
    "each of the two sub - problems are further decomposed into two problems of @xmath60-ary labeling .",
    "this procedure continues until the number of sub - problems increases to @xmath61 , each of the component constellations has only one symbol .",
    "[ fig_example ] shows an example of an 8-pam labeling .",
    "note that the symmetric capacity of a binary - input channel @xmath27 will not be changed by swapping the labeling rule of the input letters @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( see ( [ equ_iwj ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the search space of each component constellation can be halved .",
    "therefore , the number of candidate labeling rules for a @xmath0-ary pcm system is @xmath64    in this way , the number of trials to find the optimal labeling rule is reduced by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "for example , the search space for the optimal 8-ary pcm labeling is reduced from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "fig.[fig_perform ] gives the bler performance over 8-pam with optimal labeling of the proposed pcm .",
    "the information blocks consist of @xmath68 bits and the number of transmitted symbols is set at @xmath69 .",
    "the code length is defined as the number of the bits which are mapped to symbols , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "thus , code rate is @xmath71 and the transmission rate is @xmath72 bit / dim . the sc decoding algorithm and its two improved decoding schemes ,",
    "namely , the successive cancellation list ( scl ) decoding @xcite , @xcite , and the crc(cyclic redundant check)-aided scl ( ca - scl ) decoding are used to decode the polar codes , where the search width is set at @xmath73 . in comparison ,",
    "the performance of the bipcm scheme @xcite , the bitcm scheme used in the wcdma systems @xcite , and the pcm scheme with gray labeling are also provided .",
    "the simulation results show that the performance of pcm scheme relies significantly on the labeling rules . under the sc decoding ,",
    "the optimal labeled pcm provides about 1.5db improvement over the bipcm scheme . under the ca - scl decoding ,",
    "the proposed pcm scheme can be further improved and outperforms the bitcm scheme by up to @xmath1db .",
    "the figure also shows that the pcm has no sign of error floor down to the blers of @xmath74 .",
