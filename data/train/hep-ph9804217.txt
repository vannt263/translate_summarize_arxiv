    "the perturbative calculability of parton densities advertised previously emerges in a very simple and intuitive way .",
    "it is the result of the limited transverse size of the relevant @xmath1 fluctuations of the virtual photon . for an ordinary hadronic target , leading twist contributions to deep inelastic scattering come from both small and large size @xmath1 configurations . for larger targets ,",
    "the @xmath1 pair has to penetrate an extended colour field and the geometric limit of the cross section is already reached for small size pairs .",
    "accordingly , non - perturbative large size @xmath1 configurations do not contribute significantly to the total photon hadron cross section .",
    "we then go on to compare the semiclassical approach with the mclerran - venugopalan approach in greater detail .",
    "it is shown that they can be mapped onto each other once the non - abelian eikonal factors characteristic of the target colour field are recognised as the basic building blocks of both methods .",
    "we confront the different perspectives inherent to the rest frame and infinite momentum frame calculation .    performing an average over different colour field configurations ,",

    "although the above results are only valid in the limit of very large targets , we believe they are useful in a much wider sense .",
    "they provide a theoretical laboratory in which , starting from a non - perturbative yet technically manageable description of the target , different small-@xmath0 processes can be investigated .",
