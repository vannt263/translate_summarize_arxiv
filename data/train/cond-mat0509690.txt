    "ostwald ripening ( or ) is a generic coarsening process which occurs in a late stage of phase separation , when the domains ( or clusters ) of the minority phase compete for monomers . as a result ,",
    "the larger clusters grow at the expense of the smaller ones . following the pioneering work of lifshitz and slyozov @xcite and wagner @xcite , experimental and theoretical investigations of or",
    "have focused on the dynamic scaling properties of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of cluster sizes , and of its moments .",
    "these properties are determined by the kinetics of the monomer transport .",
    "simple limits of this kinetics are observed when the monomer transport is controlled either by diffusion of the monomers in the bulk , or by the processes of attachment and detachment of the monomers at cluster interfaces .",
    "the latter limit is called interface - controlled . in each of the two limits",
    "continuum mean - field theories have been formulated : for diffusion - controlled or by lifshitz and slyozov ( ls ) @xcite , and for interface - controlled or by wagner @xcite .",
    "the two models are often united under the name of the lsw model .",
    "the lsw model admits a family of self - similar solutions for the pdf of cluster sizes .",
    "however , the problem of selection of the correct self - similar solution is non - trivial .",
    "all of the lsw scaling functions have compact support and can be parameterized by the value , @xmath0 , of the logarithmic derivative at the edge of the support ; @xmath1 .",
    "ls @xcite argued that the selected pdf for the case of initial conditions with a long tail is the limiting pdf , corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "the scaled pdf should approach this function as @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial data for the pdf has compact support the selected self - similar pdf is determined by the behavior of the initial data near the edge of its support @xcite .",
    "if the initial pdf has logarithmic derivative @xmath4 at the edge of support , the selected self - similar solution is the one with the same value of the logarithmic derivative at the edge of its support : @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if the logarithmic derivative of the pdf at the edge of support at @xmath6 does not exist , the pdf does not approach any self - similar solution @xcite .",
    "these results are in apparent contradiction to experimental results which appear to show strong selection , _",
    "i.e. _ selection insensitive to initial conditions . to find strong selection we must consider dynamics beyond that of the classical lsw model .",
    "one possibility is to account for discreteness of atoms in any real system .",
    "this direction was explored by velzquez @xcite and meerson @xcite , who employed the becker - dring ( bd ) equations @xcite , properly modified to account for conservation of the total number of atoms @xcite . in the limit of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the average number of atoms in a cluster , the bd - equations reduce to the lsw model @xcite .",
    "taking into account the next order term in @xmath9 , one arrives at a fokker - planck ( fp ) equation for the cluster size pdf @xcite , see below .",
    "the drift term of the fp - equation coincides with that of the lsw model , while the small diffusion term comes from discrete - particle noise .",
    "the diffusion term produces a tail in the pdf , even if the initial data has compact support at @xmath6 . according to refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this tail drives the system towards the limiting self - similar solution corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "these arguments assume , however , that the fp - equation is a faithful long - time description of the bd - equations . though natural , this assumption is not obviously correct .",
    "there are many examples when the fp equation misses important aspects of discrete systems @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the role of discrete - particle noise by dealing directly with the bd equations , without making the fp approximation .",
    "we focus on interface - controlled kinetics .",
    "this choice is motivated by experimental findings which showed the importance of this ( sometimes overlooked ) limit in a variety of environments , such as the coarsening of two - dimensional islands on si(001 ) @xcite , coarsening of granular clusters in electrostatically driven granular powders @xcite , etc .",
    "there is an important additional motivation . both the lsw model and the bd - equations neglect spatial correlations . as a result , the quantitative validity of the lsw model is limited , in the case of the diffusion - controlled or , to extremely small area fractions @xcite . by contrast ,",
    "spatial correlations in interface - controlled or are much weaker @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the same value of area fraction , the bd - equations are more accurate in describing interface - controlled or , than diffusion - controlled or @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 be the number of atoms in a cluster , and @xmath12 be the number of clusters of size @xmath11 .",
    "the bd - equations @xcite are master equations for the populations of clusters , @xmath13 : @xmath14and monomers : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the rate of attachment of monomers to the cluster of size @xmath11 , and @xmath17 is the inverse rate of detachment of monomers from the cluster of size @xmath11 .",
    "one can always choose @xmath18 : this corresponds to a rescaled time @xmath19 ( the tilde will be omitted in the following ) , and a rescaled attachment rate coefficient @xmath20 .",
    "equations ( [ bd1 ] ) and ( [ bdmon ] ) preserve the total number of atoms @xmath21 : @xmath22    to set the stage for our analysis , let us briefly review the predictions of the underlying continuum theories . when the dynamics ( [ bd1 ] ) and ( [ bdmon ] ) reach the stage of or , one can proceed to the limit of @xmath23 and treat @xmath11 as a continuum variable ( except for the monomers , @xmath24 , which should be taken care of separately ) . then , by a truncated taylor expansion , one obtains the fp - equation @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the drift velocity and the diffusion coefficient in @xmath11-space , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "we repeatedly choose a cluster at random and let it either grow , by absorbing monomers with rate @xmath49 , or shrink by emitting monomers with unit rate .",
