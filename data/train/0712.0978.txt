    "there is a striking similarity in the patterns we observe in a crumpled ball of paper , a crushed aluminium can or , for that matter , the creases that develop on the back of one s shirt when one s back has been up against the wall a little too long .",
    "this is not an accident .    the relevant property that these materials share is that they offer resistance to tangential strain .",
    "this is captured geometrically in the statement that the metric , which determines distances between points on the surface ( and thus is a quantity intrinsic to it ) , does not change under deformation : the only permissible deformations are isometries @xcite .",
    "not only must the surface area remain fixed , right angles must remain right on the surface .    in general ,",
    "the number of ways that a surface can bend without stretching is limited .",
    "in particular , if a flat sheet is bent in more than one direction it must stretch somewhere .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the geometrical fact ",
    "gauss s inspired insight  that the product of the curvatures at any point on the surface depends only on the metric there @xcite : two quantities that are defined extrinsically are constrained by the intrinsic geometry .",
    "in particular , if the surface is flat to start with , so that one or both of its curvatures vanishes , it must remain flat .",
    "however , the number of ways a surface can be flat is itself limited .",
    "it is either part of a cylinder , a cone or , more generally , a tangent developable surface ( think frank gehry @xcite ) , ruled by straight lines @xcite .",
    "any deformation of the surface is constrained locally by the fact that it must coincide with one of them .",
    "the physically deformed surface is , of course , rarely any single one of these elementary flat surfaces .",
    "this is because the forces applied to the surface usually oblige it to fold along more than one direction somewhere .",
    "it turns out , however , that the most energy effective way to adjust to such forces is by confining the regions where stretching occurs within a series of sharp peaks and ridges @xcite .",
    "a tangent plane can not be drawn at these singular points ; the curvatures will generally diverge .",
    "the complete deformed surface will form a quilt of irregularly shaped flat patches meeting along the boundaries that these points provide .",
    "as described by cerda and mahadevan they provide the hinges about which the flat patches may flap @xcite .",
    "once such singular points are established , however , irreversible damage will be done to the surface : iron out the creases we may but the paper will remain scored , the can scarred and , perhaps this is stretching the analogy , shirts do become threadbare .    a theory which describes the detailed internal structure of this network of peaks and ridges will be complicated and it will depend on the detailed material properties of paper .",
    "an approximation , reliable for small strains , is provided by the fppl - von karman equations @xcite .",
    "the length scale of these regions is on the order of the thickness of the sheet ; viewed from outside , however , this internal structure is irrelevant : peaks become points and ridges can be treated as curves along which boundary conditions are set on the flat surface ; the only surviving material parameter in the physical description of the sheet is a modulus characterizing its stiffness .",
    "the important point is that on these longer length scales the only relevant degrees of freedom are the geometrical ones ; how the surface bends becomes an essentially geometrical problem , a fact that tends to get lost when it is treated from a continuum mechanical point of view . in this paper we would like to explore this geometrical approach to the problem .",
    "the bending energy of a surface is deceptively simple ; modulo a topological energy there is a single quadratic in curvature associated with a surface @xcite .",
    "however , determining the bending patterns of a surface when bending alone is penalized provides a subtle non - linear problem in itself and there are few useful analytical results .",
    "the problem we are interested in addressing has an added complication : there are local geometrical constraints on the surface ; the metric is fixed .    when the constraints are global it is straightforward to enforce them in the minimization of the energy by introducing lagrange multipliers .",
    "if the enclosed volume and the area are prescribed , these multipliers are identified with the equilibrium pressure and tension : they are global .",
    "this is a situation that is familiar ( in the context of fluid membranes see , for example , @xcite ) . with local constraints these multipliers",
    "get replaced by local fields with their own conservation laws reflecting the constraint .",
    "in this paper we will set up a variational framework to describe the equilibrium shapes assumed by a surface subject to local constraints . in equilibrium , we will show that the multipliers are identified with a conserved tangential surface stress .",
    "the constraints fixing the metric thus set up tangential stresses within the sheet .",
    "these add to the stresses associated with bending .",
    "they couple linearly to the extrinsic curvature in the shape equation describing the equilibrium configuration .",
    "we will illustrate the framework by examining the deformation of a flat sheet into a generalized cone @xcite .",
    "this is the simplest flat deformation of a plane exhibiting a localized distribution of energy",
    ". our focus will be on the stresses set up in the cone rather than the geometrical details of the configuration itself .",
    "we will examine in detail how the different contributions to the stress conspire to transmit force and torque along closed curves on the cone .",
    "in particular , we will show how our framework can be applied to two physically interesting setups that have been discussed in the literature .",
    "the first of these considers the depression of a circular sheet into a circular frame by application of a point force to its center @xcite .",
    "neither the sheet nor the frame needs to be circular .",
    "we will show that the consistent coupling to curvature is enough to completely determine the radial behavior of the stress tangent to a sphere centered on the apex of the cone .",
    "the radial behavior of the remaining projections of the stress tensor is then completely determined by the conservation law .",
    "we will show that additional off - diagonal stresses , that have not been studied previously , are consistent with the conical geometry .",
    "the second example considers the ` draping ' patterns assumed by a sheet supported at a point that falls under the influence of gravity @xcite .",
    "additional stress fields are now needed to counteract the effects of gravity which would tend to _ unflatten _ the disc .",
    "we show , however , that they are also completely determined by the consistent coupling to curvature .",
    "remarkably , the shape equation we obtain assumes a universal form , with or without gravity ; the physical details of the problem enter the equation only through the stress tangent to the sphere associated with the constraint .",
    "in particular , with gravity , this equation differs from its ( technically inaccurate ) counterpart obtained by pre - averaging over the radial direction .",
    "we are interested in determining the configurations that minimize the bending energy of an initially flat unstretchable surface under the influence of some set of external forces or constraints .",
    "this might be gravity , forces that act locally or the confinement of the surface within a fixed volume .",
    "we will first examine the problem without the complications introduced by gravity .",
    "the bending energy associated with the configuration @xmath3 is given by @xmath4   = \\frac{1}{2}\\int da\\ , k^2 \\ , , \\label{eq : hb}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the sum of the principal curvatures ( twice the mean curvature ) , and @xmath6 is the area element induced on the surface ( our notation is summarized in @xcite ) .",
    "we have set the rigidity modulus to be one .",
    "bending must be an isometry : not only does the geometry of the sheet remain flat almost everywhere when it is bent , it also resists shear and stretching .",
    "thus it is not sufficient to demand that the gaussian curvature vanishes ; one needs to fix the metric itself .",
    "the bending energy @xmath7 $ ] defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hb ] ) needs to be minimized subject to this constraint",
    ". the framework will also need to accommodate discontinuities and singularities which arise due to global obstructions on this requirement .",
    "distances on the surface are described by the metric , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , are the two tangent vectors adopted to the particular parametrization of the surface . in a sheet of paper the metric",
    "is fixed , @xmath11 say .",
    "we thus construct a functional to reflect this constraint @xmath12= h[{\\bf x } ] - \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\int da\\ , t^{ab}(u^a ) \\ , ( g_{ab}- g_{ab}^{(0 ) } ) \\ , .",

    "@xmath13 is a set of local lagrange multipliers implementing the constraint on the metric .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath11 as well as the multipliers @xmath15 form tensors , so that the trace appearing in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : hcdef ] ) is a scalar .",
    "thus , by construction , the functional @xmath16 is independent of the parametrization .    with the constraint in place ,",
    "it is possible to introduce a deformation @xmath17 in the shape without needing to worry if the metric is behaving . in the absence of external sources of stress ,",

    "it involves a natural extension of an approach to the equilibrium of fluid membranes using a set of auxiliary variables introduced by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "the constraint adds a tangential stress proportional to the multiplier @xmath15 ; tension will be introduced in the surface whenever its action is antagonistic to bending .",
    "this tension will generally be inhomogeneous and anisotropic .",
    "the ` shape equation ' is given by the normal projection of the conservation law  ( [ eq : fcons ] ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the laplacian on the surface constructed with the induced metric .",
    "the stress @xmath15 couples linearly to the extrinsic curvature in eq .",
    "( [ eq : elch ] ) .    the tangential component of the conservation law ( [ eq : fcons ] ) is the statement that @xmath15 itself is conserved , @xmath25 the bending energy does not enter this equation .",

    "we note that @xmath15 involves three degrees of freedom ; this is the correct number of components to pin - down the three components of the metric . from a field",

    "( [ eq : stressdef0 ] ) , unlike @xmath15 , is not conserved .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this variational approach to bending with a local constraint is more direct than its continuum mechanical counterpart . one does not need to invoke any adapted system of coordinates .",
    "one also sidesteps the need to introduce constitutive relations ; once the energy function is given , the relationship between stress and strain follows .",
    "one now needs to solve the coupled system of equations ( [ eq : elch ] ) and ( [ eq : tcons0 ] ) subject to appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "( [ eq : elch ] ) will pick up a source if external forces are operating on the sheet .",
    "in addition , the geometry will typically display geometrical singularities where eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcons0 ] ) will pick up a distributional source .",
    "we will apply this framework to the conical geometry in the next section .",
    "it is also instructive to examine how this setup would be different had we fixed only the gaussian curvature .",
    "this is addressed in appendix  [ app : gaussiancurvature ] .",
    "the relevant extension of our framework to handle the situation in which the initial surface is not flat is a straightforward generalization .",

    "a cone possesses a natural parametric representation in terms of a closed curve @xmath27 on the unit sphere .",

    "the image of the mapping @xmath31 describes a cone .",
    "we will suppose that this cone is the result of an isometric deformation of a planar disc ( not necessarily circular ) of radius @xmath32 .",
    "the length of @xmath33 is then fixed at @xmath34 .",
    "this means that the closed curve which represents the cone lives always within a single hemisphere . a flat planar disc is represented by a great circle .",
    "these are the only circular configurations consistent with the constraint on the length .",

    "thus @xmath47 should not be mistaken for the frenet curvature , @xmath50 .",
    "it is simple , however , to show that the two are related by @xmath51 .",
    "we have seen that cones can be identified with curves on a unit sphere .",
    "as described in appendix  [ app : auxvariables ] , by integrating over the radial direction @xmath52 becomes a functional of curves on this sphere .",
    "as such , one could vary the hamiltonian with respect to these curves to obtain an euler - lagrange equation which is satisfied by the curves which minimize the energy .",
    "this curve is then identified with the equilibrium shape of the conical surface .",
    "while this approach yields the correct shape equation in this case , it does not always provide the correct answer .",
    "as we will see , variation of the hamiltonian and restriction of the geometry ( integrating out the radial dependence in the conical geometry ) do _ not _ commute in general even when the disc is circular . even in this case , however , it does not possess the scope to provide a complete analysis of the problem .",
    "we will instead apply our general framework to study the conical equilibrium .",

    "let us examine the consequences of fixing the gaussian curvature instead of the metric .",
    "we thus construct the constrained functional @xmath134= h[{\\bf x } ] + \\int da\\ , w(u^a)\\ , k_{{{\\operatorname{g } } } } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is the gaussian curvature @xcite . here",
    "@xmath136 is a local lagrange multiplier constraining @xmath135 to vanish .",
    "analogous functionals can be defined for a constraint on any other geometrical scalar .",
    "the constrained equilibrium may again be expressed as a conservation law of the form ( [ eq : fcons ] ) .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath137 is again given by an expression of the form ( [ eq : stressdef ] ) with an additional tangential stress @xmath15 .",
    "however , this stress is now determined completely by the multiplier @xmath138 , @xmath139 the constraint again introduces tension in the surface but , this time , with a single degree of freedom .",
    "it is appropriate to point out that there is an ambiguity inherent in the definition of the stress tensor @xmath19 .",
    "this ambiguity is due , in part , to the gauss - codazzi integrability condition which connects the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry @xcite .",
    "if the variations are treated intrinsically , one obtains the expression we have written down for the stress ; if , however , they are treated extrinsically an apparently very different answer is obtained .",
    "the two are entirely consistent ; they differ only by a conserved null stress that does not transmit forces .",
    "the relevant calculations have appeared in a different context ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    whereas the conservation of @xmath15 is an important constraint when we fix the metric ,",
    "here it is simple to confirm that @xmath15 is automatically conserved if the geometry is flat .",
    "this is a consequence of the definition of @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdef ] ) in terms of a potential . in analogy with elasticity theory , it is appropriate to think of @xmath138 as an airy potential for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "note that the constraints break the invariance of the two dimensional bending energy with respect to conformal transformations of three - dimensional space .",
    "in general , the gaussian curvature is not preserved .",
    "it is simple to show that under inversion in the origin @xmath140 , one has @xcite @xmath141 remarkably , the only geometries which remain flat are the cones we considered with apex at the origin , and which thus satisfy @xmath142",
    ". given one cone , its inversion in the origin is another @xcite .",
    "note , however , that curves on the unit sphere are invariant under inversion in the origin .",
    "thus , while the physics might be different , the cone remains the same .",
    "if we introduce the cutoff @xmath143 at the apex and integrate over the radial direction , the bending energy of a cone formed by a circular disc with its apex at the centre is given by @xmath144   = \\frac{1}{2}\\ , a \\ , \\oint_{\\gamma }",
    ", \\kappa ^2\\ , , \\label{eq : hs2}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 is given by @xmath146 the dimensional dependence is contained completely within this logarithm .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the scale invariance of @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath52 is a functional of curves on the unit sphere .",
    "we have already pointed out in section  [ subsec : coneconstrained ] that if the boundary conditions are not symmetrical , the identification with euler elastica breaks down .",
    "it is , however , useful to see how the shape equation emerges from a variational principle which exploits the mapping from cones into trajectories on a sphere .",
    "our task then is to identify the trajectories on a sphere minimizing the hamiltonian @xmath52 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hs2 ] ) .",
    "although the euler - lagrange equation itself is simple , its derivation is quite subtle .",
    "as we have found elsewhere , it is useful to introduce an appropriate set of auxiliary variables associated with local geometrical constraints @xcite .",
    "consider the functional @xmath147 = \\oint_{\\gamma } ds \\ ; \\left [ \\frac{a}{2 } ( { \\bf u } \\cdot { \\bf t } \\times { \\bf t } ' ) ^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2 } ( { \\bf u}^2 - 1 ) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2 } ( { \\bf t}^2 - 1 ) + { \\bf f } \\cdot ( { \\bf t } - { \\bf u } ' ) \\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : hc}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are two local lagrange multipliers enforcing the constraints that @xmath36 is a unit vector and that the parameter @xmath28 is arc - length on the sphere . the area constraint is thus implemented by fixing the range of integration on @xmath28 to the interval @xmath150 $ ]",
    ".    variation of @xmath151 with respect to @xmath36 gives @xmath152 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp1 ] ) has been simplified by using the structure equations  ( [ eq : tp ] ) for the curve .",
    "note , in particular , that @xmath153 is not constant as it would be for a translationally invariant hamiltonian . in the functional @xmath151 translational invariance",
    "is broken both in the energy itself and in the constraint on @xmath36 .",
    "variation with respect to @xmath57 identifies the vector @xmath153 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp1 ] ) as @xmath154 later , we will provide a physical interpretation of @xmath153 as an effective force per unit length along a ray of fixed @xmath28 .    by substituting the expression for @xmath153 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftn1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp1 ] ) we obtain three equations describing the equilibrium .",
    "the projections along @xmath155 and along @xmath57 determine the multipliers @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the remaining equation along @xmath49 is the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "let us first examine the component of the conservation law along @xmath57 .",
    "we note that @xmath159 this equation fixes the function @xmath157 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftn1 ] ) up to a constant .",
    "we have @xmath160 where @xmath161 is a constant .",
    "we thus identify @xmath162 comparing the two stress tensor projections ( [ eq : f|| ] ) and ( [ eq : fperp ] ) from sec .",
    "[ subsec : coneconstrained ] with the lagrange multiplier @xmath163 yields the remarkably simple relation @xmath164 if @xmath70 .",
    "this confirms that , when this approximation is valid , @xmath163 is the tangent stress along a ray of fixed @xmath28 .    to determine @xmath156 , note that @xmath165 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fc ] ) , it follows that @xmath166 note that this variable does not appear in the final shape equation which involves normal projections . for the record , we have @xmath167 its normal projection together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fc ] ) provides the euler - lagrange equation @xmath168 the constant @xmath161 is a tension associated with the fixed area constraint which is implied by fixing the arc - length .",
    "if this constraint is relaxed , @xmath169 ; however , there persists a ` tension ' proportional to @xmath145 associated with constraining the curve trajectory to a sphere .",
    "earlier we identified the origin of this term in the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath170 on the cone ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : coneconstrained ] ) .",
    "we reproduce the shape equation ( [ eq : elk ] ) obtained earlier if we identify @xmath71 with the ratio of the constants ( @xmath171 ) ( when @xmath71 is constant ) .",
    "generally , however , it appears to be beyond the scope of the variational analysis based on the reduced hamiltonian to provide a consistent description of the cone .",
    "in particular , it does not appear to be possible to accommodate @xmath172 .",
    "even when @xmath173 , there is no obvious way , within this simplified framework , to analyze the @xmath29 dependent stresses set up in the cone as they , for instance , show up in the presence of gravity ( see section  [ sec : gravity ] ) .",
    "we note that there is an integrability condition associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpp ] ) .",
