    "intense single - cycle light pulses are very important tools for attosecond science and high - field physics , and are also enabling a new generation of compact khz laser - plasma accelerators @xcite .",
    "these pulses can be generated using several post - compression techniques @xcite and precise temporal characterization is crucial for optimizing their compression and for establishing the pulse duration in an experiment .",
    "for example , a chirp change of merely 4fs@xmath0 in the driving pulse in @xcite resulted in a 20% change in the accelerated electron energy .",
    "sub - cycle 0.975fs optical pulses have been measured with attosecond streaking @xcite , and a petahertz optical oscilloscope was demonstrated with two - cycle pulses @xcite , but these strong - field techniques require high pulse energies , vacuum beamlines , isolated attosecond pulses , and electron or extreme ultraviolet spectral detection . accessing the single - cycle regime using purely optical techniques",
    "usually requires nonlinear media with low dispersion and large phase - matching bandwidths , due to the over octave - spanning spectra and extremely short durations of the pulses . in the case of frequency - resolved optical gating ( frog )",
    "@xcite , these characteristics also translate into an overlap between fundamental and second - harmonic spectra in collinear shg frog setups , which limits the measurement bandwidth to less than one optical octave .",
    "this can be overcome with noncollinear frog , but the resulting geometrical time smearing limits the temporal resolution and gives overestimated pulse lengths .",
    "addressing these problems has required precise knowledge of the total spectral response function affecting the measured frog signal , which includes effects due to the noncollinear geometry , nonlinear crystal thickness and phase matching bandwidth ( all carefully chosen for a particular pulse ) , dispersion of the nonlinearity and detector sensitivity .",
    "this approach enabled frog measurement of 1.7-cycle pulses at 790 nm ( 4.5fs ) @xcite .",
    "noncollinear cross - correlation frog ( xfrog ) provides added control over phase - matching and was used to measure 0.9-cycle pulses at 4.2 m ( 12.4fs ) @xcite , although this required a fully characterized short reference pulse and the geometric time smearing is no longer negligible if one wishes to measure few femtosecond single - cycle pulses . on the other hand ,",
    "a variant of spectral phase interferometry for direct electric - field reconstruction ( spider ) @xcite , known as spatially encoded arrangement ( sea)-spider @xcite , is free of time smearing and enabled measuring 0.9-cycle pulses at 1.6 m ( 4.5fs ) @xcite .",
    "another spider variant , two - dimensional spectral shearing - interferometry ( 2dsi ) @xcite , was used to measure 1.1-cycle , 1 m pulses ( 3.7fs ) @xcite . very recently , time - domain ptychography was applied to 3.7fs , 1.5-cycle pulses at 800 nm @xcite .",
    "the single - cycle - capable optical techniques described above can be powerful but involve operations such as temporal overlap of short pulses , beam splitting and recombination , which all add to increased experimental complexity and difficulty .",
    "the dispersion - scan ( d - scan ) technique @xcite is a recent approach for the simultaneous measurement and compression of femtosecond laser pulses and was originally proposed as a way to simplify such stpdf , by coupling the compressor with a simple single - beam , non - interferometric , nonlinear measurement stage , resulting in a straightforward pulse measurement setup while still providing robust and precise pulse retrieval .",
    "experimentally , it involves only the measurement of the spectrum of a nonlinear signal for different dispersions applied to the pulse .",
    "this can be performed with standard pulse compression setups , such as prism , grating , grism or chirped mirror compressors .",
    "the nonlinear signal is measured as a function of compressor position around the point of maximum compression ( the reference position ) and the dispersion introduced by each displacement step is either well - known @xcite or is self - calibrated from the measurement @xcite . in shg",
    "d - scan , this gives a two - dimensional trace of the shg spectrum vs. position , from which the electric field of the pulse can be extracted with a numerical algorithm .",
    "if we consider a pulse in the frequency domain , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the pulse electric field and @xmath3 is its spectral phase , the measured d - scan trace , @xmath4 , can be written as the product of a spectral response function , @xmath5 , and an ideal trace , @xmath6 @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the dispersion - dependent nonlinear signal , which for shg d - scan is the square of the time - domain field , @xmath9 , after the compressor , i.e. @xmath10 with @xmath11 the frequency - dependent phase per unit displacement introduced by the compressor and @xmath12 the compressor position .",
    "an optimization algorithm is then used to retrieve _ both _ the spectral phase of the pulse , @xmath13 , and the unknown response function , @xmath5 , from the d - scan trace and calibrated linear spectrum @xcite . a recent approach to fast d - scan retrieval can also be used to obtain the pulse amplitude and phase from the d - scan trace alone , but in this case the trace itself must be calibrated @xcite .",
    "although shg d - scan has been successfully demonstrated with few - cycle pulses since its inception @xcite and is nowadays an established technique in the demanding sub-4-fs regime ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , a common misconception is the assumption that shg d - scan is limited to pulses with less than one octave , because it uses collinear @xcite or near - collinear @xcite shg . on the contrary , over octave - spanning single - cycle pulses have been measured directly with shg d - scan , both in scanning @xcite and single - shot @xcite variants .",
    "the fact that broadband shg corresponds to sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) between all the frequencies in the spectrum translates into intrinsic redundancy in the d - scan trace : phase information of a particular region of the pulse spectrum is found not only at its shg frequency , but convoluted across the trace .",
    "this relaxes phase - matching and measurement bandwidth requirements , as a partial measurement of the shg / sfg trace is sufficient for phase retrieval over the whole spectrum @xcite .",
    "few - cycle capable third - harmonic generation ( thg ) d - scan variants have also been devised @xcite . nonetheless , both shg and thg are limited by transparency and phase - matching conditions .",
    "this is particularly problematic for ultraviolet pulses , where choice of adequate shg crystals is very limited .",
    "also , the shg or thg signal can easily extend into the deep- and vacuum - ultraviolet range , which complicates its detection . on the other hand",
    ", degenerate third - order processes such as cross - polarized wave ( xpw ) generation and self - diffraction ( sd ) can offer greater flexibility , since they facilitate phase - matching over wide bandwidths , are practically wavelength independent over the transparency zone of the nonlinear medium and the nonlinear signal lies in the same spectral region as the pulse being measured .",
    "sd has been applied to frog @xcite and very recently to spider @xcite .",
    "xpw d - scan was recently demonstrated with sub - octave 6.5 fs pulses @xcite , which required increasing the degree of linear polarization of the pulses with brewster reflections prior to measurement .    in this work",
    "we introduce a new inline d - scan scheme based on self - diffraction in thin transparent media ( sd d - scan ) and demonstrate it with over octave - spanning sub-4-fs pulses , further illustrating its potential for pulse measurement over nearly 3 octaves .",
    "the nature of the sd process also enables applying this technique to pulses with arbitrary polarization .",
    "the experimental setup for sd d - scan ( fig . [ fig : setup]a ) is analogous to shg d - scan @xcite and only requires replacing the shg crystal ( 5 m bbo ) with a thin ( 30 m ) fused silica slide , whose dispersive pulse broadening is negligible even for single - cycle pulses .",
    "the pulses are generated by the hollow - core fiber ( hcf ) compressor detailed in @xcite , which delivers sub-4-fs 800 nm pulses with energy up to 200j at 1khz , and includes the glass wedges and chirped mirror ( cm ) compressor shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the beam ( @xmath14 mm diameter ) is sent through a mask with two vertical slits ( 2 mm width and separation ) , placed so that the spectrum transmitted by each slit is identical ( and also identical to the full - beam spectrum , although this is not necessary for retrieval ) .",
    "the two pulses ( < 1j ) are focused in the slide ( or in the bbo crystal ) with a spherical mirror ( focal length of 25 cm ) at a crossing angle of 1.4@xmath15 and a movable slit is then used to select the off - axis sd beam ( or the on - axis shg beam ) prior to measurement with a fiber - coupled spectrometer .    the mathematical expression for the sd d - scan trace is also given by , but now the nonlinear signal , @xmath16 , is given by@xmath17    the phase change introduced by the compressor , @xmath18 , is only that of the moving wedges , given by @xmath19l$ ] , with @xmath20 the refractive index of the    speed of light and @xmath21 the ( relative ) thickness of glass crossed by the pulse .",
    "the measured shg and sd d - scan traces , each composed of 103 individual spectra ( step size of 29 m ) are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : traces ] , where a good agreement with the corresponding retrievals is observed .",
    "the tilt in the shg d - scan trace reveals some residual negative third - order dispersion ( tod ) that was left uncompensated for ( unlike in @xcite , where a thin water cell was used for compensation ) .",
    "this enabled testing the sd d - scan with an over octave - spanning spectrum similar to @xcite but with a more interesting temporal pulse structure due to tod .",
    "considering that sd is a third - order degenerate process , i.e. @xmath22 , one could at first expect the sd signal to cover the whole spectral range of the input pulse ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_plots ] ) .",
    "instead , the sd d - scan trace is mostly contained between @xmath23 and @xmath24 nm ( fig . [ fig : traces ] ) , since the efficiency of this process is wavelength- and angle - dependent , as shown in appendix a. this is not detrimental for retrieval over the full spectral range of the pulses , provided that their phase does not change during propagation in the nonlinear medium ( due to dispersion , nonlinear effects like self - phase modulation , or both ) , as required by , , , otherwise a full propagation approach may be necessary .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra_plots ] shows the measured spectrum and the retrieved spectral phase ( average of 10 retrievals with random seed phases ) for sd and shg d - scan .",
    "the phases show a good agreement over the main portion of the spectrum , hence no significant phase alterations are taking place in the 30 m slide .",
    "the reduction in the sd signal at longer wavelengths , possibly due to chromatic coupling of the sd signal into the spectrometer , results in an increased phase error in that region .",
    "the fast phase variation seen below @xmath25 nm is due to the known divergence in the dispersion of the cms .",
    "this makes retrieval harder for shg and sd d - scan , which together with their different sensitivity to the incident pulse phase can result in the observed discrepancy for shorter wavelengths .    in the time domain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity_plots ] ) , the pulse intensities retrieved by both methods are also very similar , especially the main pulse and the pre - pulse structure due to negative tod .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) pulse duration was found to be @xmath26fs for sd and @xmath27fs for shg d - scan .",
    "this compares well with the value of @xmath27fs reported in @xcite for the same hcf compressor before residual tod compensation .",
    "propagation of these pulses through an adequate transparent medium , e.g. water @xcite or z - cut kdp @xcite , directly results in near - transform - limited , high - quality single - cycle 3fs pulses .    as mentioned previously",
    ", an advantage of the d - scan method is that no a priori knowledge of the spectral response function @xmath5 is necessary for pulse retrieval , since the d - scan algorithm also retrieves it .",
    "nonetheless , we derived a theoretical expression for @xmath5 , both for comparing with the retrieved response and to numerically explore the measurement of even broader bandwidth pulses using sd d - scan .",
    "the complete derivation is given in appendix a , where we obtain the following spectral response , or efficiency , of the sd process @xmath28^{8}\\mathrm{sinc}^{2}\\left[\\frac{\\delta k_{z}(\\omega ) l}{2}\\right ] , \\label{eq : response_function}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 the phase - mismatch along the propagation direction and @xmath30 the medium thickness .",
    "the phase - mismatch can be approximated by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the internal crossing angle in the medium and @xmath33 the external angle .",
    "since the sd d - scan trace was measured with the same intensity - calibrated spectrometer used for the linear spectrum , the retrieved response can be directly compared with that of the sd process alone .",
    "figure [ fig : theoretical curves]a shows the retrieved sd d - scan response and the theoretical efficiency of the sd process in fused silica , calculated from for @xmath34 m and @xmath35 .",
    "we see that the general trend of the experimental response roughly follows the theoretical prediction .",
    "the observed deviation is compatible with the mentioned chromatic coupling into the spectrometer .    to illustrate the possibility of multi octave - spanning pulse measurement with sd d - scan , we simulated a sech2 spectrum centered at 800 nm with a fourier - limit of 2.7fs and a phase consisting of tod and some ringing ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : theoretical curves]b ) .",
    "the corresponding sd d - scan trace was calculated from with the signal of and the response function of [ eq : response_function ] , assuming a 30 m fused silica slide and a crossing angle @xmath35 .",
    "the spectral response was further clipped to zero after 1000 nm to model the limited sensitivity of a silicon - based spectrometer . in these conditions ,",
    "the d - scan algorithm successfully retrieved the spectral phase ( treated as a fourier polynomial with 64 coefficients ) and the response function from 500 to 1900 nm , i.e. , over nearly 3 octaves .",
    "these results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : theoretical curves]b .",
    "in conclusion , we developed a new d - scan technique for temporal pulse characterization based on self - diffraction ( sd d - scan ) and demonstrated it with over octave - spanning sub-4-fs pulses .",
    "the frequency - dependent efficiency of the sd process was derived theoretically and compared with the spectral response retrieved by the d - scan algorithm .",
    "sd d - scan has a simple inline implementation , is single - cycle and multi - octave capable , and enables measuring ultra - broadband pulses with arbitrary polarization and in difficult spectral ranges like the ultraviolet .",
