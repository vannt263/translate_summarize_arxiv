    "the riccati  pad method ( rpm ) yields accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of separable quantum  mechanical models@xcite .",
    "the approach is based on a rational approximation to a modified logarithmic derivative of the eigenfunction and the best fit occurs when the eigenvalue is a root of a hankel determinant@xcite .",
    "the roots of the hankel determinant approach the energies of bound states and resonances as the determinant dimension increases .",
    "the rpm does not require explicit specification of the boundary condition , the approach commonly selects the physical one automatically for each problem .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues always correspond to the correct asymptotic behaviour at infinity@xcite .",
    "as far as we know the rpm is the only approach that applies exactly in the same form to both bound states and resonances .",
    "if the potential  energy function has poles at two points , then the roots of the hankel determinant approach the eigenvalues of the problem with dirichlet boundary conditions at such coordinate values@xcite .",
    "we call these boundary conditions `` natural '' .    in some cases",
    "one is interested in that the eigenvalue equation satisfies `` artificial '' bounday conditions .",
    "for that reason , in this paper we propose a modification of the rpm to treat dirichlet boundary conditions at arbitrary coordinate locations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we introduce the rpm for one  dimensional models and suggest how to force the desired boundary conditions .",
    "in particular we concentrate on a linear potential that has proved useful for the treatment of some physical problems . in sec . [",
    "sec : results ] we show results for the chosen eigenvalue equation , and in sec . [ sec : discussion ] we summarize the main features of the rpm and draw some conclusions .",
    "we introduce the rpm by means of a simple one  dimensional problem of the form @xmath0 that depends on an adjustable parameter that is necessary to satisfy the other boundary condition which we will specify below .",
    "for example , in the case of a dimensionless schrdinger  like equation @xmath1 , where the energy @xmath2 is the adjustable parameter .",
    "for concreteness we restrict to this case from now on .    in order to apply the rpm we define the modified logarithmic derivative @xmath3 where the function @xmath4 is chosen so that @xmath5 is analytic at @xmath6 and therefore can be expanded in a taylor series @xmath7 notice that the coefficients @xmath8 depend on @xmath2 .",
    "the rpm is based on the transformation of the power series ( [ eq : f_series ] ) into a rational function or pad approximant that satisfies @xmath9(x)=\\frac{\\sum_{j=0}^{m}a_{j}x^{j}}{\\sum_{j=0}^{n}b_{j}x^{j}}=\\sum_{j=0}^{m+n+1}f_{j}x^{j}+o(x^{m+n+2 } )   \\label{eq:[m / n]}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "notice that the rational ansatz has just @xmath12 adjustable parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 to fit the first @xmath15 coefficients of the taylor series ( [ eq : f_series ] ) .",
    "the additional requirement determines the value of @xmath2 as a root of the hankel determinant : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dimension of the hankel matrix .",
    "each hankel determinant is a polynomial function of @xmath2 and we expect that there is a sequence of roots @xmath18}$ ] , @xmath19 that converges towards the value of @xmath2 consistent with the second boundary condition .    commonly , the hankel quantization condition ( [ eq : hankel ] ) provides the eigenvalues consistent with the bound states ( @xmath20 ) or the resonances embeded in the continuum ( outgoing or incoming waves ) .",
    "the rpm automatically selects the eigenvalues that are consistent with such `` natural '' boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "if the potential  energy function exhibits poles , then the rpm automatically selects dirichlet boundary conditions at the corresponding coordinate points .",
    "for example , when @xmath21 the rpm selects the boundary conditions @xmath22@xcite , and @xmath23 when @xmath24@xcite .    in some cases one wants to force boundary conditions that are not related to singular points in the potential  energy function .",
    "suppose that we are interested in the differential equation ( [ eq : dif_y(x ) ] ) with the boundary conditions @xmath25 .",
    "we can force such `` artificial '' boundary conditions by means of a properly chosen function @xmath4 in equation ( [ eq : f(x ) ] ) .",
    "in fact , the function @xmath26 introduces poles at @xmath6 and @xmath27 into the differential equation for @xmath5 that we can rewrite as @xmath28 in this way we expect to obtain the eigenvalues consistent with those boundary conditions .    for simplicity",
    "we consider @xmath29 a motivation for this choice is that the resulting differential equation and boundary conditions are related to a simple model for the study of electrons in a crystal under the effect of an electric field@xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath30 provides the states and energy levels of an electron of mass @xmath31 and charge @xmath32 in a box of impenetrable walls at @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( that mimics the finite size of the crystal ) under de effect of an electric field of strength @xmath35@xcite .",
    "this extremely simple model has also been useful in the study of the tail of the density of states of a disordered system in the presence of an electric field@xcite . by means of the change of variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 one obtains the differential equation ( [ eq : dif_y(x ) ] ) with the coefficient ( [ eq : q(x)_lin ] ) where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "another reason for the choice of such example is that one can write its solutions exactly in terms of the airy functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42   \\label{eq : y(x)_exact}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a normalization factor , and the dimensionless eigenvalues @xmath44 , @xmath45 are given by the quantization condition @xmath46",
    "the application of the rpm is straightforward : we obtain as many coefficients @xmath47 as necessary from the differential equation for @xmath5 , construct the hankel determinants @xmath48 @xmath19 and calculate their roots .",
    "we expect these roots to converge towards the eigenvalues of the differential equation with the boundary conditions mentioned above .",
    "table [ tab : eig_bound ] shows sequences of roots of the hankel determinants that already converge towards the exact eigenvalues given by equation ( [ eq : exact_eigenval ] ) when @xmath49 . as in previous applications of the rpm",
    "we appreciate that the rate of convergence of the hankel sequences decreases as the energy increases because the denominator of the rational approximation ( [ eq:[m / n ] ] ) requires greater values of @xmath43 to accomodate the increasing number of zeros of the solution @xmath50 .",
    "we clearly see that this modification of the rpm enables one to solve eigenvalue equations with `` artificial '' dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the hankel determinants are polynomial functions of the eigenvalues and display many more roots than those that we choose to build the sequences that converge towards the actual eigenvalues of the given problem .",
    "one of the features of the rpm is that an increasing number of roots cluster around the eigenvalues as @xmath51 increases . for the simple example chosen here",
    "there are only two roots that approach a given eigenvalue as @xmath51 increases ( at least for @xmath52 ) .",
    "[ fig : seq_bound ] shows latexmath:[$\\log    sequences .    in the present case the hankel determinants exhibit other roots than those mentioned above .",
    "they correspond to the `` natural '' boundary condition @xmath20 with eigenvalues given exactly by the quantization condition @xmath54 .",
    "the choice of @xmath4 suggests that we are looking for a solution of the form @xmath55 but the rpm also selects a solution of the form @xmath56 with the `` natural '' boundary condition at infinity . the rational approximation to @xmath57 absorbs and removes the pole at @xmath27 and produces sequences of roots that converge towards the solutions of the unbounded problem ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "table [ tab : eig_unbound ] shows some of these eigenvalues for @xmath49 .",
    "curiously , more roots cluster around a given eigenvalue of the unbounded model than of the bounded one .",
    "[ fig : seq_unbound ] shows latexmath:[$\\log    sequences that appear when @xmath52 .",
    "the function @xmath60 is more convenient for the `` natural '' boundary conditions and , consequently , the sequences of roots of the hankel determinants exhibit greater convergence rate . fig .",
    "[ fig : seq_unbound2 ] shows @xmath61 for the optimal sequences for both choices of @xmath4 . when @xmath26 the rational approximation to @xmath62 has to remove the wrong zero at @xmath63 and , for this reason , the rate of convergence of the rpm is slightly smaller .",
    "notice that the solution @xmath50 that satisfies @xmath64 does not have a cero at @xmath27 .",
    "simple models of bounded quantum  mechanical systems have proved useful for the study of several physical phenomena@xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the modification to the rpm proposed here is suitable for bounding a system between impenetrable walls that force dirichlet boundary conditions at their locations .",
    "the numerical results of the preceding section show that the convergence rate of the modified rpm is as remarkable as in the case of the unbounded and naturally bounded systems@xcite .",
    "a curious feature of present application of the rpm to a bounded model is that the approach also provides the eigenvalues of the unbounded one .",
    "this outcome is a consequence of the fact that the rpm automatically selects the correct asymptotic behaviour at infinity of the solution to the differential equation . in all the cases",
    "studied that asymptotic behaviour coincided with the one required by physical reasons ( vanishing at infinity , incoming or outcoming waves , etc)@xcite .",
    "the transformation of the schrdinger equation into a riccati one has proved suitable for the application of the quasilinearization method ( qlm ) to quantum mechanics@xcite . regarding the calculation of the resonances of a quartic anharmonic oscillator the rpm@xcite proves to be more accurate than the qlm@xcite .",
    "the main ideas behind the rpm have recently proved useful for the treatment of two  point nonlinear equations@xcite of interest in some fields of physics@xcite . the resulting approach called hankel ",
