    "the development of transformation optics @xcite and metamaterials @xcite had lead to the theoretical prediction of invisible dipoles @xcite and invisibility cloaks @xcite . since then the principles behind invisibility have been demonstrated in a number of experiments that feature cloaking in some reduced form .",
    "electromagnetic cloaking was first realised for microwaves of one frequency and polarisation @xcite .",
    "numerous subsequent electromagnetic experiments achieved `` carpet cloaking '' @xcite .",
    "a carpet cloak does not make things invisible , but makes them appear to be flat .",
    "approximate cloaking has also been realised through tapered waveguides @xcite .",
    "invisibility by plasmonic covering @xcite was demonstrated as well @xcite .",
    "furthermore , non - electromagnetic forms of cloaking have been demonstrated for acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "+ however , the realisation of electromagnetic cloaking suffers from a practical and a fundamental problem @xcite .",
    "the practical problem is that the material requirements for electromagnetic cloaking are very difficult to meet , whereas the fundamental problem is that perfect invisibility @xcite requires that light should propagate in certain cloaking regions with a superluminal phase velocity that tends to infinity . in principle , this can be achieved by metamaterials , but only for discrete frequencies that correspond to the resonant frequencies of the cloaking material @xcite .",
    "in contrast , acoustic cloaking @xcite is much easier to achieve , since acoustic waves are not effected by relativistic causality and thus they are not restricted by their velocity in air .",
    "+ broadband cloaking based on non - euclidean geometries has been proposed in @xcite to avoid the requirement for infinite light velocities for electromagnetic cloaking . in this proposal",
    "the speed of light is finite in the entire cloaking region and , therefore , this cloak has the potential of working for a broad range of frequencies .",
    "however a fundamental problem still remains .",
    "since space has to be expanded to make room for the invisible region within the cloak , the implementation of this device will still demand superluminal propagation ( i.e. propagation with a velocity that exceeds the speed of light in vacuum ) .",
    "the same is true for `` carpet cloaking '' @xcite where the velocity of light in the cloaking device must exceed the speed of light in the host material , i.e. vacuum if such devices were to find practical applications .",
    "+ in this paper we give an example of a device that achieves complete electromagnetic cloaking  not just `` carpet cloaking''while all light velocities within the cloak are finite and less than the speed of light . through this example",
    "we demonstrate that invisibility cloaking is possible without superluminal propagation and anomalous material requirements .",
    "since transformation optics establishes a one - to - one correspondence between spatial geometries and dielectric media , invisibility can be visualised in terms of virtual geometries .",
    "therefore , we explain the main ideas of this paper in terms of pictures . the complete calculations behind these pictures can be found in the appendix .",
    "+ first , let us contrast our method to conventional cloaking based on coordinate transformation .",
    "figure  1 explains the conventional cloaking method described in @xcite . a single point in virtual space",
    " also called electromagnetic or optical space  is expanded into a finite region in physical space . the expansion is effected by the curved transformation of the straight virtual coordinate lines . consequently , a light ray that traces out a curved trajectory in physical space ( fig .",
    "1b ) appears to propagate along a straight line in virtual space ( red line in fig .",
    "this creates the illusion that light has propagated through empty space , making the central region in physical space ( region bounded by the blue circle in fig .",
    "1b ) invisible .",
    "+ however , there is a fundamental problem with this device",
    ". light crosses the central point in virtual space ( blue dot in fig .",
    "1a ) in an infinitely short time .",
    "this point turns into an extended region in physical space , which still has to be traversed in an infinitely short instant .",
    "therefore , the phase velocity of light will tend to infinity along the outer boundary of the invisible region in physical space .",
    "infinite light velocities can be achieved by metamaterials , but only for discrete resonant frequencies of the material @xcite , fundamentally restricting the applicability of this cloak .",
    "+ in contrast , the broadband non - euclidean invisibility device proposed in @xcite achieves full cloaking without the need for infinite light speeds .",
    "it makes use of the rich structure of non - euclidean geometries to avoid infinite expansions and singularities .",
    "+ the background geometry of this cloak is established through the expansion of space , which is similar to optical conformal mapping @xcite ( see appendix [ ap : branches ] ) . a finite region in physical space ( red eye - shaped region in fig .",
    "2a ) is turned `` inside out '' to produce a hidden infinite virtual plane ( red lower plane in fig .",
    "the blue outer region in physical space ( fig .",
    "2a ) is stretched to make the upper sheet complete without the red region ( fig .",
    "+     the two sheets remain connected by the yellow branchcut ( fig .",
    "2b ) , through which light can pass from one sheet to another .",
    "the two virtual sheets provide the background geometry of the device . by the appropriate modification of the lower sheet ,",
    "objects placed there can be hidden from sight . for the time being",
    "we will focus our attention on the blue region of the upper sheet , which we shall call the `` stretched region '' of the cloak .",
    "+ it is clear from fig .  2 that the blue region was stretched everywhere by merely finite factors .",
    "therefore , establishing this geometry will not require infinite light speeds in contrast to the previous cloaking example ( fig .  1 )",
    "however , a problem still remains . a light ray that propagates along the straight yellow branchcut in virtual space ( fig .",
    "2b ) will have to trace out a slightly longer curved path along the physical branchcut ( fig .",
    "2a ) in the same amount of time .",
    "since light travels in virtual space with the speed of light in vacuum @xcite , the phase velocity in physical space will have to be faster than @xmath8 .",
    "this can be achieved only for certain frequency bands that are around the resonant frequencies of the material @xcite , which restricts the applicability of the cloak .",
    "in the previous section we saw that the non - euclidean cloak requires that light should propagate faster than the speed of light in vacuum . in order to avoid such anomalous light velocities",
    ", we construct a device that makes use of the same space expansion as the non - euclidean cloak ( fig .",
    "2 ) , but is built up from different constituents .",
    "+ to slow the light rays down in the stretched region of the cloak ( blue region in fig .",
    "3a ) , we place an optically dense medium ( that is , a medium with high refractive index ) on the upper sheet of virtual space ( fig .  3b ) . this medium must itself be invisible to avoid revealing the presence of the invisibility device . therefore , we use the partially transmuted invisible sphere as the background profile for the upper sheet of virtual space ( purple circle in fig",
    "all rays entering this sphere perform a complete loop in it and emerge with their original direction restored ( fig .",
    "therefore , the entire sphere appears invisible . at the same time , if a light ray crosses the yellow branchcut while propagating through the sphere , it will pass onto the lower virtual sheet of the geometry ( fig .",
    "we place maxwell s fish eye lens on the lower virtual sheet and surround it by a circular mirror ( dark cyan circle in fig .",
    "3b ) to guide all light rays that enter the lower sheet back to the yellow branchcut .",
    "the light ray reemerges from the branchcut on the upper sheet and finishes its trajectory in the invisible sphere ( fig .",
    "since the original direction of the ray is restored when it emerges from the device , it appears to have propagated through empty space .",
    "note that there is a region outside the mirror on the lower sheet that is inaccessible to light .",
    "any object placed in that region is undetectable to light and thus becomes invisible .",
    "+     fig .",
    "3a shows the light trajectory in physical space .",
    "the light ray ( red ) completes a loop that is characteristic of the invisible sphere , bounces off the spindle - shaped mirror ( dark cyan ) twice and leaves the device with its original direction restored . note that the infinite region outside the circular mirror on the lower virtual plane ( fig .",
    "3b ) transforms into a finite spindle - shaped region in physical space ( white region in fig .",
    "this region is inaccessible to light and any object placed in there remains hidden from sight .",
    "since the stretched region of the cloak now sits in the optically dense invisible sphere , all light rays within it are propagating slower than the speed of light .",
    "+      in this section we explain the partially transmuted invisible sphere and maxwell s fish eye lens with the mirror , which serve as the two fundamental building blocks of our virtual geometry .",
    "+ the invisible sphere is an optical lens that is invisible in the limit of geometrical optics @xcite .",
    "each incident ray completes a loop in the sphere and emerges in the direction of its entry ( fig .",
    "4a ) , creating the illusion that space is empty .",
    "+        this device has a spherically symmetric refractive index profile given by @xcite    @xmath9    where    @xmath10{-\\frac{1}{r}+\\sqrt[2]{\\frac{1}{r^2}+\\frac{1}{27}}}\\text{.}\\ ] ]    in the expression above we assume that the device has unit radius .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath11 tends to infinity as @xmath12 .",
    "this means that the speed of light goes to zero as it gets close to the geometric centre of the device .",
    "this is extremely difficult to achieve in practice .",
    "+ therefore , we make use of partial transmutation @xcite  a modification of the method presented in @xcite  to expand space with a non - constant factor in the immediate vicinity of the singularity within a given radius of the device ( dashed circle in fig",
    ".  4b ) . by this expansion",
    "we give more space for the propagation of light and thus ensure that the refractive index is finite everywhere ( i.e. light propagates with a non - zero velocity ) within the entire device @xcite ( see appendix [ ap : invisiblesphere ] ) .",
    "+ maxwell s fish eye lens @xcite is an optical device in which all light trajectories trace out perfect circles ( fig .",

    "+        here @xmath15 is the value of the refractive index at the equator .",
    "it can assume any values that are greater than or equal to unity .",
    "a choice of large @xmath15 slows the light rays down , but it does not affect the trajectories overall , since the form of the trajectories in the device are dependent only on the relative distribution of the refractive indices .",
    "it is precisely this feature of the lens that we can exploit to avoid superluminal propagation in the inner branch of the cloak ( see appendix [ ap : fisheye ] ) .",
    "now we turn to calculating the material properties of the cloak in physical space .",
    "we make use of the method described in @xcite . we utilise the ideas of transformation optics @xcite , which establish a connection between spatial geometries and dielectric media .",
    "we calculate the permittivity and permeability tensors in bipolar coordinates ( see appendix [ ap : materialproperties ] ) . the tensors obtained have the following form : @xmath16    these two tensors completely describe the electromagnetic response of a dielectric material and their eigenvalues ( i.e. @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) can be engineered into metamaterials to implement the cloak .",
    "the tensor eigenvalues and the refractive index values are related as @xcite    @xmath20    it is clear from the expressions above that the refractive index values could be greater than one even if not all of the individual tensor eigenvalues are greater than unity .",
    "however , in order to avoid anomalous dispersion and absorption at all frequencies , it is important that the individual tensor eigenvalues are also greater than unity .",
    "+ through the appropriate positioning of the building blocks of our electromagnetic geometry and the adjustment of their parameters , all tensor eigenvalues can be brought above unity .",
    "we calculated the distribution of the tensor eigenvalues @xmath21 , and @xmath19 for the geometry shown in  fig .",

    "+ we note that some of these values are quite extreme and might be very difficult to achieve in practice . however , this cloak is just an example , which demonstrates that full invisibility cloaking is possible without superluminal velocities .",
    "the range of material parameters could be optimized by changing the topology of the cloak slightly ( see appendix [ ap : optimization ] ) or by introducing further coordinate transformations to eliminate regions with high permittivity and permeability values ( see @xcite for an example ) .",
    "+ figure  6 shows that the profile of the cloak is highly anisotropic within the inner branch of the cloak ( demarcated by black lines ) and isotropic outside it . in fig .",
    "7 we depict a light trajectory against the values of the @xmath17 component in the presence of the mirror .",
    "the light ray performs a loop within the transmuted centre of the invisible sphere , bounces off the mirror twice and leaves the device with its original direction restored .",
    "objects placed in the white region behind the mirror are invisible .",

    ", total internal reflection will depend solely on the values that the invisible sphere and maxwell s fish eye assume on the two sides of the branchcut .",
    "the fish eye profile changes between 5 and 10 and reaches a value of about 8 at the midpoint of the branchcut .",
    "calculations show that total internal reflection is avoided and the size of the branchcut is maximised when the branchcut is oriented as shown and is placed within the blue annulus in fig .  9 , where the red circle seals off the region where @xmath133 .",
    "assuming that the invisible sphere has unit radius , we obtain @xmath134 and @xmath135 for the radii of the red and green circles respectively .",
    "this yields @xmath136 for the length of the branchcut ( i.e. @xmath137 in equations ( [ eq : bipolars ] , [ eq : complexbipolars ] , [ eq : inversecomplexbipolars ] , [ eq : physicalbipolars ] and [ eq : physicalbipolars2 ] ) . +",
    "part of the stretched region ( black circle in fig .  9 ) will now lie outside the blue annulus .",
    "however , calculations show that @xmath17 goes sufficiently quickly to unity towards the boundary of the stretched region to ensure that the combined index values do not dip below one",
    ". + finally , we have to choose a sufficiently small radius for the transmutation of the invisible sphere to raise the combined eigenvalues within the transmuted region above one .",
    "we found that @xmath138 is the greatest and thus optimal transmutation radius that achieves this .",
    "+ note that refraction will occur at the branchcut when light crosses from the outer to the inner branch due to the differing values of the invisible sphere and the fish eye profile on the two sides of the branchcut .",
    "however , due to the particular symmetry of the device , when the light ray crosses the branchcut for the second time , the effect of the refraction is exactly reversed and thus the trajectory is not distorted overall .",
    "+ we note that , for the purposes of optimization , the refractive index of the inner cloak of our device can be replaced by an index profile that is identical to that of the inner cloak of the non - euclidean cloak described in @xcite and @xcite except for an overall multiplicative constant of 5.274 .",
    "this constant has to be introduced to ensure that all index values in the inner cloak are above unity .",
    "following optimization , we find that the eigenvalues for this construction are @xmath139 $ ] , @xmath140 $ ] , and @xmath141 $ ] , which shows that the range of the parameters is already a factor two smaller than the range for the cloak with the fish eye profile .",
    "however , the size of the invisible region also becomes smaller for this cloak .",
    "it is generally true that the greater the invisible region , the higher tensor eigenvalues are needed ."
