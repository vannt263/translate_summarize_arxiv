    "the knowledge of the solid angle ( @xmath2 ) subtended by a right , finite , circular cylinder at a point isotropic source is required in numerous problems in nuclear and radiation physics .",

    "we give some examples of such works .",
    "@xcite outlined a general procedure based on stokes theorem to reduce the double integral @xmath5 to a contour integral in a single variable ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) .",
    "the method was used to express @xmath4 and @xmath3 as single integrals which were numerically integrated .",
    "extensive tables describing these results both for the disc and the entire cylinder were reported in a separate work @xcite .",
    "an approximation to the solid angle defined by two parallel plane surfaces was described by @xcite and applied in the cases of two equal rectangles and two equal circles in a face - to - face geometry .  with this method each surface is subdivided into small finite areas and the two double integrals are then replaced by a double summation .",
    "the calculation of @xmath4 was treated by @xcite by replacing the disc with a regular n - side polygon of equal area , for which an analytical expression was given . in a similar way ,",
    "@xmath3 was approximated by the analytical expression for an n - side regular polyhedral surface @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the monte carlo method to calculate the cylinder solid angle for two height - to - radius ratios ( 1:1 , 2:1 ) , considering distances from source to cylinder center up to 12 cylinder radii and angular positions of the source ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9 from the cylinder axis .",
    "an analytical expression for @xmath4 in terms of elliptic integrals due to philip a. macklin @xcite appears included as a footnote in @xcite . in the present work",
    "we show that also @xmath3 can be reduced to elliptic integrals and give , without derivation , expressions for @xmath4 which can be deduced in a akin way and are different from that due to p.a .",

    "on the other hand , the calculation has been put under the sound roof of the subject of elliptic integrals and functions .    in a recent work",
    "@xcite we describe the analytical calculation of the solid angle subtended by a cylinder at a point cosine source . combining these results with those presented here , the case of an axially symmetric point source with an angular distribution given by @xmath11 can be treated analitically when the source axis ( @xmath12 ) is orthogonal to that of the cylinder .",
