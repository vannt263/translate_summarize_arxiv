    "when a bias voltage is applied perpendicularly to a sheet of bilayer graphene or rhombohedrally ( abc ) stacked trilayer gaphene , it opens an energy gap and regulates the gap s size  @xcite .",
    "this remarkable effect allows the realization of digital logic based on graphene - based switchable devices such as field effect transistors ( fets ) . turning on the graphene fet s bias voltage creates a band gap which in turn halts electronic conduction and switches the fet from the on ( conducting ) state to the off ( insulating ) state .",
    "such devices first were studied theoretically  @xcite and later were demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "et al _ fabricated a dual - gated fet with a transport gap of @xmath0 mev , which compares favorably to room temperature ( @xmath1 mev )  @xcite .",
    "they achieved an on / off current ratio of @xmath2 at room temperature and @xmath3 at @xmath4k .",
    "more recent experiments used doping to create a mobility gap in single - gated bilayers @xcite , adjusted the fermi level via doping @xcite , and demonstrated a @xmath5 mev transport gap via ionic gating @xcite .",
    "san - jose @xcite proposed a concept of pseudospin valve in bilayer graphene based on the electron transport controlled by the external gate .",
    "some initial studies of transport in dual gated graphene trilayers also have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the principal motivation for these studies is the promise of graphene - based digital devices .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternate architecture for graphene transistors which does not require a band gap .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic_diagram]a illustrates the graphene devices which we propose : graphene bilayers ( or trilayers ) supported by a disordered substrate , with strong disorder in the lower graphene layer and much weaker disorder in the upper layers .",
    "current flows longitudinally through the graphene , and a perpendicular bias voltage switches between the on ( conducting ) state and the off state .",
    "the key physics of our fet architecture lies in the density of states , whose value at the fermi level @xmath6 determines the carrier density and the conductance .",
    "we will show that in bilayer and trilayer graphene a bias voltage can cause the electrons at the fermi level to concentrate on one or the other of the graphene layers , so that conduction favors one layer over the other . if the conduction electrons concentrate on the strongly disordered lower graphene layer , the conductance will be strongly attenuated by the disorder .",
    "reversing the bias voltage will shift the density of states to concentrate on the upper graphene layer which is only weakly affected by disorder and therefore has a much larger conductance .     and lowers the voltage of the upper layer by @xmath7 . in pane ( c )",
    "the bias voltage is reversed . ]    in this paper we will focus on computing and understanding the conductance ratio @xmath8 , where the longitudinal conductances @xmath9 are measured between two edges of the graphene sheet .",
    "the numerator in this ratio - the positive - biased conductance - is illustrated in figure  [ fig : schematic_diagram]b where a positive bias voltage elevates the energy of the lower layer .",
    "the denominator is shown in figure  [ fig : schematic_diagram]c where the bias voltage is reversed and depresses the lower layer s energy .",
    "a large value of @xmath8 indicates good switching between on and off states .",
    "the main contributions of our paper are that ( 1 ) disorder which is concentrated on the lower graphene layer can dramatically increase the conductance ratio , and ( 2 ) a large conductance ratio can be obtained even when there is no bulk band gap .",
    "our proposed disorder - based fet converts disorder from a liability to a resource and allows greater flexibility in fet design .",
    "in particular , it allows use of multilayers which do not develop a band gap when a bias voltage is applied .",
    "trilayer graphene has two stable allotropes which are distinguished by their stackings .",
    "the more naturally abundant allotrope follows the bernal ( aba ) stacking order which possesses both inversion and mirror symmetry , and these symmetries prevent creation of a band gap .",
    "previous work on gap - based trilayer graphene fets has avoided the aba stacked allotrope and concentrated on the less abundant rhombohedrally ( abc ) stacked allotrope which permits creation of a band gap  @xcite .",
    "we will show that a disorder - based fet can be realized with both trilayer allotropes .",
    "furthermore , our disorder - based fet gives new possibilities for engineering the width of the off state and the fermi level where it occurs . in gap - based fets",
    "the fermi level must be tuned to coincide with the gap , which occurs at graphene s dirac point and has a width that is controlled by the multilayer s band structure .",
    "a small gap or improper tuning of the fermi level would restrict the working temperature to small values and decrease the conductance ratio .",
    "in contrast , in our architecture the off fermi level is controlled by the bias voltage ; the bias voltage can be changed to tune the off state to coincide with the fermi level .",
    "we will show that properly engineered disorder - based fets can have off state widths of order @xmath10 mev , which is competitive with gap - based fets . in effect , compared to gap - based fets which are completely determined by band structure , disorder - based fets are much more flexible and controllable .",
    "they are sensitive to design of a suitable substrate and of its bonding with graphene , to engineering of the disorder type and strength , and to choice of fermi level and bias voltage .",
    "our fet proposal occurs in the context of an already rich theoretical literature about conduction in disordered bilayer and multilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "various previous works examined many different types of disorder , calculated the density of states and the scattering length , included screening effects , and paid careful attention to the conductance s dependence on the electron density at both high and low densities .",
    "in general the focus has been on very small defect densities , because disorder has been understood as detrimental to device performance and experimentalists have had considerable success in avoiding defects and increasing the mobility .",
    "in contrast to gap - based graphene fets , our fet architecture requires disorder to affect the lower graphene layer more than the upper layer , breaking their symmetry .",
    "this disorder profile is physically plausible if the lower layer is supported by a substrate or is subjected to a disordering treatment , but has been studied very little @xcite .",
    "zhong and collaborators @xcite showed that if disorder is confined to one layer then some portions of the spectrum remain in the conducting phase even at very large disorder .",
    "mobility edges separate the insulating and conducting phases . here",
    "we explore the possibility of using this disorder profile in conjunction with a gate induced bias voltage to realize an fet .",
    "we have studied fet performance as the disorder strength is varied by an order of magnitude .",
    "although we found some weak fet - like behavior at smaller disorder strengths , we found acceptable conductance ratios only when the off state lies near the anderson localization regime ; strong disorder is required .",
    "each scatterer must be quite strong , placing it near the unitary scattering limit , similarly to vacancies and resonant scatterers .",
    "a variety of strong nonlinear effects including charge redistribution between layers may occur in this strong disorder regime .",
    "in the lower graphene layer there must be a high density of scatterers , which again contrasts with previous studies .    because our target disorder regime has not been thoroughly studied in multilayer graphene , and because there is ample room for tailoring the disorder and the substrate to suit the fet , in this paper we have adopted a simplified - even phenomenological - approach which is appropriate for exploring this architecture s possibilities .",
    "we have not made a detailed analysis of the many possible types of disorder , examined charge equilibration , incorporated the details of the gate potential or the leads , or the like . the present paper is a proof of concept which focuses on two key mechanisms which can cooperate to produce an fet ; we show ( a ) that gating can shift the carriers to one layer or another , and ( b ) that the conductance is reduced when the carriers are shifted to the more disordered graphene layer .",
    "our proof of ( a ) is quite simple , based on @xmath11 model calculations of pristine graphene s band structure .",
    "these results are supported by our tight - binding calculations which incorporate disorder .",
    "our proof of ( b ) is based on the same tight - binding calculations .",

    "we use well known tight - binding hamiltonians  @xcite for bernal ( ab ) stacked bilayer graphene and for aba ( bernal ) and abc ( rhombohedral ) stacked trilayers : @xmath13@xmath14 @xmath15 in each hamiltonian the first term describes intralayer hopping , the second term describes the bias potential , and the third term describes interlayer hopping .",
    "the @xmath16 index selects the graphene layer , and has values ` b ' , ` m ' , and ` t ' for the lower , middle and upper layers respectively . each graphene layer is composed of two sublattices ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the annihilation operators of the two sublattices .",
    "intralayer hopping occurs only between nearest neighbors , as signaled by the @xmath19 notation .",
    "we choose the parameters of pristine graphene as follows : @xmath20 , the intralayer hopping strength , is a constant @xmath21 ev . throughout this paper",
    "all energies will be quoted in units of @xmath20 .",

    "the on - site potential of trilayer graphene s middle layer is always zero .",
    "we model the two leads as being semi - infinite and connected at opposite ends of the fet .",
    "their structure , fermi level , and bias voltage are identical to those of the fet itself ; the only difference is that leads are clean while the fet is disordered .",
    "there is no lattice mismatch between the leads and the fet .",
    "we evaluate the longitudinal conductance using the nonequilibrium green s function formalism  @xcite . for our calculation of the conductance without interactions",
    "this formalism is equivalent to the caroli formula @xcite @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are the advanced and retarded green s functions connecting the left and right leads and @xmath32 are the self - energies of the leads .",
    "the green s functions and the lead self - energies are evaluated recursively @xcite , decreasing the computational burden .",
    "all of our calculations set the fet width and length at about @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 nm is the distance between nearest neighbors in graphene .",
    "we add non - magnetic disorder to the tight binding hamiltonians which we have just discussed .",
    "a fundamental requirement of our fet architecture is that the disorder must break the symmetry between the lower layer and the upper layers . in our simplified model",
    "the disorder affects only the lower graphene layer .",
    "we consider two types of disorder .",
    "the first is on - site anderson disorder , a random local potential acting on individual atoms ; we add random numbers to the lower layer s on - site potential @xmath29 .",
    "the second type is intralayer bond disorder , which changes the bonds within the lower graphene layer ; we add random numbers to the lower layer s intralayer hopping strength @xmath36 .",
    "as is conventional , the disorder is randomly distributed in the interval @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 is the disorder strength .",
    "it is also short - range , with no correlation between neighboring sites .",
    "all of our conductance calculations are averaged over two hundred random disorder realizations for each value of the disorder strength , fermi level , and bias voltage .",
    "the sample to sample variation in the conductance is never larger than one conductance quantum @xmath39 .    for small disorder strengths the bond disorder",
    "can be understood as modeling variations in the lower graphene layer s covalent carbon bonds , which may be caused by a lattice mismatch between the graphene and its substrate  @xcite , or by variations in the chemical bonding between the two  @xcite .",
    "we will find the best fet performance at large disorder strengths @xmath38 which are of the same order of magnitude as the intralayer hopping @xmath20 .",
    "these very large variations in the bond strength demonstrate the disruption of the carbon bonds by large densities of carbon vacancies , resonant scatterers , missing bonds , adsorbed molecules , etc . at large disorder strength both on - site",
    "anderson disorder and bond disorder are close to the unitary limit of strong short - range scatterers .",
    "they belong to the same universality class , and we will find that they have the same effect on the conductance .",

    "the conductance is reduced close to the localized regime , which is characterized by @xmath46 .",

    "a trend towards @xmath51 is visible for large fermi levels @xmath52 . at large disorder",
    "the conductance ratio peaks are located near @xmath53 .",
    "if the fermi level lies near these peaks , then inverting the bias voltage will cause a substantial decrease in the conductance .",
    "these results at small bias voltage @xmath54 show that bilayer graphene s conductance is sensitive to a bias voltage .",
    "however conductance ratios higher than three are achieved only with strong @xmath45 bond disorder . in this",
    "case panes ( d ) and ( e ) indicate that both the on state and the off state lie near the localized regime , and that the on conductance is small @xmath55 .",
    "this scenario is not suitable for producing standardized and reproducible fets , because the sample - to - sample variation in the conductance is generally about one conductance unit .",
    "on conductances exceeding ten conductance units are desirable .",

    "our results show that similar conductance ratios can be obtained independently of the band gap by exploiting disorder and a mobility gap .    the vertical lines in mark the left edge of the peak in the conductance ratio , which occurs when the fermi level coincides with the bias voltage : @xmath62 .",
    "our results for the conductance show that at @xmath62 there is a very sharp rise in the on conductance @xmath26 ; at this fermi level the effects of disorder are suddenly and strongly reduced .",
    "an opposite effect - a dip - becomes visible in the off conductance when the bias voltage is increased to @xmath79 . inside the conductance ratio peak the off state moves toward the localized regime , and at the @xmath80 bias it is clearly localized .",
    "these two opposite effects on the on and off conductance both contribute to the peak . in the next section we will find their origin in the band structure s dependence on the bias voltage .     of bilayer graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges , at three different disorder strengths .",

    "larger bias voltages @xmath97 do produce larger on conductances and reduce the sample - to - sample fluctuations to acceptable levels .",
    "more exactly , we find that when the bond disorder strength is @xmath92 the on conductance exceeds ten .",
    "the disorder strength @xmath92 , like the disorder @xmath45 which we examined in zigzag edged bilayers , puts the on biased system in the conducting regime @xmath98 while forcing the off biased system into the localized regime @xmath99 .",
    "this is an optimal disorder strength .",
    "the stronger disorder @xmath67 shown in localizes the bilayer both in the on and the off state , and therefore reduces the on conductance to small values that do not ensure sample to sample reproducibility .",

    "we studied the effect of disorder on the conductance ratio of bilayer graphene under a bias voltage .",
    "we found that good fets with large condutance ratios and small sample - to - sample variation could be obtained when the disorder strength is optimized to moderate values and the bias voltage is not too small  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is independent of the disorder type and the edge type , but it does depend on the fermi level .",
    "in particular , the left edge of the conductance ratio peak is controlled by the bias voltage ; it always appears at @xmath62 . in the next section",
    "we will show that this behavior originates in graphene s band structure .",

    "the conductance is further reduced when disorder is increased .",
    "in contrast when conduction electrons are concentrated on the upper graphene layer they feel a disorder potential that is diminished by the second power of the interlayer hopping @xmath125 , and therefore both the scattering length and the conductance are larger",
    ". in the interval of energies above @xmath62 a positive bias voltage shifts conduction electrons to the upper layer and increases the conductance , while a negative bias voltage shifts them to the lower layer and decreases the conductance .",
    "this effect produces the peak in the conductance ratio which we have observed in figures  [ fig : bilayer ] and  [ fig : armchirebd ] , and explains why its left edge is at @xmath126 .",
    "the effect is reversed at bias voltages between the band gap and @xmath62 : here a positive bias voltage concentrates conduction electrons on the lower layer and produces the dip in the conduction ratio .",
    "moreover this effect is absent at large fermi levels : the led converges toward @xmath127 which implies that it is insensitive to bias voltages . as a result",
    "the conductance ratio is near unity at large fermi levels .",
    "further examination of the led explains why the conductance ratio is improved by increasing the bias voltage to large values .",
    "panes ( e)-(h ) of figure  [ fig : distributionbilayer ] show that the led converges toward one ( or zero depending on the bias sign ) when the bias is increased ; the conduction electrons concentrate more strongly on a single layer , magnifying the disorder s effects .",
    "it is remarkable that the band structure of pristine bilayer graphene can do such a good job of explaining the conductance ratio peaks and the position of their edges even though the disorder is quite large .",
    "thorough explanation of the width and shape of the peaks may require additional consideration , as may also explanation of the conductance ratio at small fermi levels .",
    "in particular , disorder may renormalize the fermi level  @xcite , and therefore shift both the led and the conductance ratio .",
    "moreover , our conductance calculations were performed on finite size nanoribbons , and the interplay between the localization length scale and the sample size is surely important .",
    "for all upper panes and @xmath128 for all lower panes . the left - most panes (",
    "a ) and ( c ) show the aba ( bernal ) stacking s bands .",
    "the adjacent panes ( b ) and ( d ) show the rhombohedral ( abc ) stacking s bands and bias - induced band gap .",
    "the right four panes ( e)-(h ) plot the local electron distribution - the average expectation value of the layer - resolved projection operator .",
    "the right - most panes were obtained with abc stacking , and the adjacent panes were obtained with aba stacking .",
    "the solid red lines give the lower graphene layer s led , while the dotted blue lines give the upper layer s led . a lower level led near one signals that the conduction electrons are concentrated on the lowest layer .",
    "the black dashed lines ( horizontal lines in the left four panes and vertical lines in the right four panes ) signal fermi levels where a positive bias voltage concentrates the led on the lowest layer and a negative bias voltage moves the distribution to the upper layers . ]    in the previous sections we have seen that fets can be fabricated from disordered bilayer graphene .",
    "trilayer graphene is also an attractive material .",
    "as mentioned earlier , its two stable allotropes show quite different responses to a bias voltage .",
    "the relatively less common rhombohedral ( abc ) allotrope exhibits a gap when a perpendicular bias voltage is applied , but the more naturally abundant bernal ( aba ) stacked allotrope does not show any gap .",
    "research aiming towards fets and digital logic has focused on the abc stacking order .",
    "because the disorder - based fet proposed here does not require a band gap , its application to aba trilayers is particularly interesting .",
    "we begin by calculating the band structure of both allotropes .",
    "we adopt @xmath11 models which are similar to one that we used for bilayer graphene .",
    "they focus on the low energy physics near the @xmath101 point , and therefore employ only six bands - two for each layer .",
    "the @xmath11 hamiltonians  @xcite for trilayer graphene with aba and abc stacking are : @xmath129    @xmath130    the fermi velocity and interlayer hopping parameters in these trilayer hamiltonians are the same as the ones that we employed for bilayer graphene .    panes ( a)-(d ) of display the energy dispersions of these hamiltonians at two values of the bias voltage .",
    "our energy dispersions are similar to those obtained in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "when the bias voltage is zeroed both the aba stacking and the abc stacking possess discrete symmetries that guarantee that there is no gap .",
    "the aba zero - bias dispersion is a combination of linear and quadratic terms , while the abc dispersion is cubic .",
    "when a bias voltage is imposed the abc stacking s discrete symmetry is broken , the bands hybridize , and a gap is clearly visible in panes ( b ) and ( d ) . in contrast a bias voltage",
    "does not entirely break the aba stacking s discrete symmetry ; the level crossing at the @xmath101 point is preserved , and panes ( a ) and ( c ) show that no gap is opened .",
    "the bias does however cause hybridization of the linear and parabolic low - energy bands by breaking the mirror reflection symmetry with respect to the central layer .",
    "although the spectrum and led of trilayer graphene are significantly more complicated than those of bilayer graphene , the band structure exhibits similar features that allow a bias voltage to shift the led between the lower and upper layers .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines in panes ( a)-(d ) highlight intervals in the spectrum where there is only one band . when a positive bias voltage is applied , that band s led is concentrated outside of the lower layer .",
    "the led on the lower layer nears zero in the interval between the horizontal dashed lines .",
    "panes ( e)-(h ) show the leds of the upper and lower graphene layers .",
    "the vertical dashed lines match the horizontal lines in panes ( a)-(d ) , and confirm that in these intervals a positive bias pushes the lower layer s led near to zero and the upper layer s led near to one .",
    "we conclude that in these intervals the bias shifts conduction electrons between the upper and lower graphene layers , and therefore we expect that the conductance is sensitive to the bias voltage .    , and the lower panes with @xmath72 .",
    "zigzag edges were used in all panes .",
    "the vertical dashed lines are the same as in , which illustrates the band structure of trilayer graphene .",
    "these lines signal intervals in which a positive bias voltage concentrates the led on the disordered lowest layer . ]",
    "presents the conductance ratio of trilayer graphene with zigzag edges and both stacking orders .",
    "we obtained these results using the tight binding hamiltonians of equations [ abatightbinding ] and [ abctightbinding ] and the same numerical procedure which we outlined earlier for bilayer graphene .",
    "the dashed vertical lines highlight the intervals where our @xmath11 hamiltonians indicate that the led should be very sensitive to the sign of bias potential .",
    "as expected , we find conductance ratio peaks inside these intervals .",
    "the peak width for @xmath131 is @xmath132 mev in aba - stacked graphene and @xmath133 mev in abc - stacked graphene .",
    "we see again that the conductance ratio increases when the disorder strength and/or the bias voltage is increased .",
    "moreover , even at strong bond disorder @xmath67 the on conductance s sample - to - sample reproducibility is good in each pane - in the conductance ratio peaks @xmath26 ranges from @xmath134 to @xmath135 . in trilayer",
    "graphene the on state is less affected by substrate disorder than in bilayer graphene , so the on state conducts even at disorder larger than @xmath67 .",
    "what impresses us most is that the conductance ratio reaches similar levels in both aba and abc stacked trilayers even though no band gap exists in aba stacked graphene .",
    "previous research aimed at graphene - based fets has required a band gap  @xcite . in this present study of both gapped and ungapped materials we have established that the conductance ratio does not depend on the presence of a bulk band gap .",
    "our proposed disorder - based fet requires the band structure be sensitive to a bias voltage , so that in the off state the fermi level coincides with a mobility gap ( localized states ) , while in the on state it coincides with conducting states .",
    "a bias - sensitive mobility gap is all that is necessary .",
    "our new fet architecture offers considerably more design flexibility and control than gap - based fets while still delivering large conductance ratios and off state widths . in this present paper",
    "we have used simple models to analyze the key physical mechanisms .",
    "engineering an optimal fet will require more detailed and realistic study concerning the choice of a suitable substrate , of a preferred disorder type and defect density , and of a method for introducing disorder to the lower graphene layer .",
    "the effects of the substrate and of disorder on the lower layer s structure and chemistry could be better understood , as could the bonding between the graphene layers .",
    "lastly , the influence of the fet s size and aspect ratio on the conductance ratio deserves some attention .    in summary",
    ", we have proposed a new graphene fet architecture which is based on disorder rather than on a band gap .",
    "we showed that when the bias voltage is large enough and the disorder strength is tuned properly the on/off conductance ratio can reach @xmath2 .",
    "the on conductance is large enough to be observed experimentally , and sample - to - sample variations are small enough to ensure reproducible behavior .",
    "we showed that the fet s sensitivity to a bias voltage is caused by a shift of the conduction electrons from one layer to the other , and that this shifting effect originates in the band structure of pristine multilayer graphene .",
    "we studied bilayer graphene , both natural allotropes of trilayer graphene , and both zigzag and armchair edges , and showed the fet architecture is independent of these details .",
    "in particular , our fet architecture does not require a band gap , and requires disorder concentrated on the bottom layer as an essential element of its design .",
