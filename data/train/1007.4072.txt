    "the line width of a rotationally - supported galaxy is a measure of the difference between the maximum rotation velocities of the approaching and receding sides .",
    "a galaxy s luminosity is related to the mass of its luminous component ( and the evolutionary state of the stellar populations ) .",
    "the observed correlation between global line widths and luminosities is therefore a manifestation of a more general connection between galaxy masses and rotational velocities .",
    "a correlation is of course expected for gravitationally bound systems in which the mass distribution is dominated by luminous matter .",
    "empirically , the correlation is tight enough to allow the tfr to be inverted and used to determine distances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is therefore clear that investigating variations of the local tfr with galaxy luminosity , size , type and other parameters should provide valuable insight into the growth of luminous structures in the universe .",

    "the difference is much smaller in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "this has been taken as evidence that the discrepancy at optical wavelengths is at least partially due to the effects of recent star formation on the luminosity , which is reduced in the near - infrared .",

    "particular attention has been paid to s0 galaxies , which are the earliest galaxies with rotationally - supported stellar discs .",
    "the fact that they are more common in the centres of clusters , rarer on the outskirts , and rarest of all in the field , the opposite of the trend observed for spirals , suggests that environmental processes transform spirals into s0s @xcite .",
    "processes such as ram - pressure stripping @xcite , strangulation @xcite and harassment @xcite may have removed the gas from the disks of spiral galaxies and left them unable to form stars .",
    "s0s do however exist in the field , where such processes should be insignificant .",
    "passive evolution or the effects of active galactic nuclei in spirals have been suggested as possible formation mechanisms outside dense environments @xcite .",
    "problems remain with the disk fading picture , however : the bar fractions of spirals and s0s are discrepant @xcite , in a given environment s0s are at least as bright as spirals @xcite , and the bulge - to - disc ratios of s0s are difficult to reconcile with those of their presumed progenitors @xcite",
    ". see @xcite for a modern review of this issue .",
    "unless they are violent , these processes should make only a slight change to the kinematics and dynamical masses of s0s , but a significant change to their luminosities .",
    "assuming they do not have systematically different dark matter fractions , this change in stellar population should cause s0s to have fainter luminosities for a given rotational velocity and lie offset from the tfr of spirals .",
    "the size of any offset and the difference between the scatters of the s0 and spiral tfrs can therefore be used to constrain models of s0 formation and evolution ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bam06 ) .",
    "a well - constrained s0 tfr also raises the possibility of extending the tully - fisher distance determination technique to earlier galaxy types , and of probing variations of mass - to - light ratio with redshift .",
    "measuring the tfr of s0s is difficult because they do not usually have extended gaseous discs . instead of using a gaseous emission line width as a measure of maximum rotation ,",
    "several groups have used resolved rotation curves derived from stellar absorption lines .",
    "these raw observations must then be corrected for asymmetric drift ( i.e. pressure support ) before they can be presumed to trace the circular velocity ( and therefore the potential of the galaxy ) .",
    "a number of groups have done just this and found that s0s are indeed fainter than spirals for a given rotational velocity .",
    "@xcite found that s0s lie on a tfr offset by 0.5mag at @xmath9-band from the spiral tfr ( with 0.7mag intrinsic scatter ) . @xcite and @xcite found an offset of 0.2mag at @xmath9 and @xmath10-band ( with 0.51.0mag intrinsic scatter ) . combined these data with new observations of galaxies in the fornax cluster and found that the combined sample of 60 s0s lies around 1.5mag below the spiral tfr at @xmath11-band ( 0.9mag scatter ) and 1.2mag below the spiral tfr at @xmath1-band ( 1.0mag scatter ) .",

    "an alternative approach to measuring and correcting the rotational velocities of the earliest type galaxies is to construct dynamical models that , in principle , directly probe the circular velocity of a system . at the expense of model - dependent assumptions",
    ", this approach removes the uncertainties associated with the asymmetric drift correction , which may be both significant and systematic .",
    "@xcite did this for a sample of six edge - on s0s and found that they lie 1.8mag below an @xmath9-band spiral tfr ( with 0.3mag intrinsic scatter ) .",
    "modelling also allows the tfr to be extended to elliptical galaxies with little or no rotational support . as with s0s ,",
    "previous dynamical modelling studies of ellipticals have found that they are fainter than spirals for a given rotational velocity : @xcite , 0.7mag at @xmath12-band ; @xcite , 0.8mag at @xmath9-band ; @xcite , 0.6mag at @xmath12- and 1.0mag at @xmath11-band ; @xcite , 1.5mag at @xmath11- , 1.2mag at @xmath1-band .",
    "however , all previous studies comparing the tfrs of s0s and ellipticals to those of spirals have used independently determined reference tfrs for spiral galaxies ( taken from , e.g. , @xcite ; tp00 ) .",
    "these reference tfrs are derived in the traditional way , using global line widths from observations . in section  [ sec : rotation ] we discuss the technical and observational issues involved in characterizing the enclosed mass of a disc galaxy in an unbiased way .",
    "we argue that comparisons between tfrs derived from different measures of rotation are not a priori justified and are likely to introduce artificial and uncertain offsets in practice .",
    "the main astrophysical goal of the present work is thus to compare the tfrs of spiral and s0 galaxies in a way that is not vulnerable to these uncertain systematics , by using measures of luminosities and rotational velocities determined identically for both s0s and spirals .",
    "readers who are more interested in the results of this comparison and its implication for the evolution of s0s , may wish to skip ahead to section  [ sec : data ] , where we present our sample . in section  [ sec : fitting ] we describe the numerical method used to simultaneously determine the tfrs of spirals and s0s .",
    "we then present tfrs for the two samples in terms of near - infrared and optical luminosities , stellar mass and dynamical mass . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results in the context of models of s0 formation and evolution and previous analyses of s0 tfrs .",
    "we conclude briefly in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to construct a tully - fisher relation one needs a measure of rotation .",
    "this can be derived from , for example , the global line width , spatially - resolved , h@xmath13 or stellar rotation curves or velocity fields , sparse tracers ( e.g. globular clusters and planetary nebulae ) , or the circular velocity of dynamical models at some fiducial location . in principle , all these measures are related to the rotation of the galaxy , but the relationship of these single numbers to the enclosed mass is complicated by the fact that observed rotation curves ( and indeed modelled circular velocity curves ) do not always flatten .",
    "moreover , it not obvious that these observational measures directly and accurately comparable to each other . both the nature of the observations and the corrections applied for different techniques could conceivably introduce systematics that vary with galaxy properties such as type , mass or size .    for example , the transformation of a global line width to a measure of rotation involves corrections for instrumental broadening and turbulent motion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the extent to which these corrections are able to recover the intrinsic motion of the tracer or the true circular velocity of the galaxy potential has recently been questioned @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", stellar kinematics must be corrected for asymmetric drift , which typically involves making approximations which are difficult to justify prima facie ( see section  [ sec : defined ] ) .",
    "finally , the construction of dynamical models often involves simplified modelling of the full distribution function ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or assumptions about intrinsic morphology , anisotropy and the role of dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wbc09 ) .",
    "these considerations place the direct comparisons of tfrs derived using different measures of rotation on shaky ground .",
    "offsets which are ascribed to fading or brightening could in fact be due to systematic biases that differ between the measures of rotation used . for typical slopes of the tfr ,",
    "a relatively small systematic difference in velocity of @xmath14dex introduces an offset in the tfr that is indistinguishable from a @xmath15mag difference in luminosity .",
    "this is of the order of the typical zero - point offsets claimed for s0 tfrs @xcite , so it is crucial that we eliminate ( or at least quantify ) the systematics introduced by such comparisons . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we examine the differences between the results of three different measures of rotation when applied to the same 28 early - type disc galaxies , and discuss the implications for comparisons of the zero - point of the tfr .",
    "we aim to compare measures of rotation derived from global line widths ( which we denote @xmath16 ) , resolved gas rotation curves ( @xmath17 ) , stellar kinematics ( @xmath18 ) and dynamical models ( @xmath19 ) for the 28 galaxies in the present work .",
    "this sample , which consists of 14 spirals and 14 s0s , is described in section  [ sec : data ] .    for @xmath16 , the rotational velocity derived from global line widths , we adopt the quantity ` vrot ` from hyperleda @xcite .",
    "this is the inclination - corrected maximum gas rotation velocity , based on an average of independent line width determinations taken from the literature .",
    "strictly speaking , hyperleda also uses spatially - resolved h@xmath13 rotation curves to calculate ` vrot ` , but these observations were only present in hyperleda for four of the galaxies in our sample , and there was no evidence that they systematically disagreed with the line width values at any more than the 0.01dex level .    for @xmath17 , we fit gaussians to the position - velocity diagrams ( pvds ) presented in @xcite . these are derived from [ nii ] emission lines .",
    "we only use the region of the pvd where the rotation curve is flat .",
    "this restriction means that it is not possible to measure @xmath17 for many of the galaxies in our sample , either because emission was not detected , or because it was not sufficiently extended .        .",
    "we calculate the asymmetric drift - corrected stellar velocity , @xmath18 , using the observed stellar kinematics presented in @xcite . in order to more accurately measure the local circular velocity we attempt to correct these observations for the effects of line - of - sight integration and asymmetric drift using the same recipe as used in , which we describe briefly below .",
    "we make no attempt to improve this recipe , since one of our goals is to assess the biases in previous determinations of the tfr based on stellar kinematics . the raw observations and their corrected values",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "@xmath27 is an exponential disc of scale length @xmath29 , which we measure from the major - axis surface brightness profiles of our @xmath1-band images at radii outside the bulge @xcite .",
    "we then apply a correction for asymmetric drift to @xmath20 to derive @xmath30 , an estimate of the true local circular velocity : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the azimuthal stellar velocity dispersion .",

    ", we assume that it is equal to an exponential fit to the observed stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath34 .",
    "this assumption is of course flawed , since the observed dispersion includes a contribution from the changing component of the azimuthal velocity along the line - of - sight .",
    "this effect will bias the asymmetric drift correction to be too high .",
    "however , the error is small in practice , and , crucially for the present work , it is not a strong function of galaxy type in the range s0sb . under the assumptions described above , for disks with typical levels of pressure support ( @xmath35 at the relevant radii @xmath36@xmath37 ) , numerical integration shows that the error introduced by wrongly assuming @xmath38 causes @xmath39 to overestimate the true circular velocity by @xmath40dex .",
    "this error is almost independent of @xmath41 in the range @xmath42 , a quantity which is in any case independent of morphological type for our sample .",

    "we modelled the mass distribution of each galaxy by assuming it is composed of an axisymmetric stellar component with a constant mass - to - light ratio and a spherical nfw dark halo @xcite .",
    "the axisymmetric stellar component is based on an analytic fit to the observed near - infrared photometry of the composite bulge and disk .",
    "the absence of a triaxial bar component in our models does not significantly affect either the global properties of the models or the local kinematics at the large radii relevant to the tfr ( see section 5.5.3 of for a more extensive discussion of this issue ) .",

    "the upper panel demonstrates that @xmath49 @xmath50dex with an rms scatter of 0.019dex for both spirals and s0s .",
    "this small difference , which is on average less than 4 per cent , is probably due to the additional approximations and assumptions introduced in the asymmetric drift correction compared to the jeans models .",
    "we note in particular that it is consistent with the error due to assuming @xmath51 , as discussed in section  [ sec : defined ] .",
    "the absolute offset between these measures is not significant in the context of the tfr and , crucially , there is no evidence of any systematic difference between s0s and spirals .",
    "the scatter is also extremely small .",
    "since both @xmath18 and @xmath47 are derived from the observed stellar kinematics , their close agreement is not of itself independent proof of the accuracy with which they trace the true circular velocity .",
    "the agreement of @xmath18 with the results of detailed and robust jeans modelling does suggest , however , that the approximations inherent in eqns .",
    "( 12 ) yield an approximately valid solution of the jeans equations .",
    "the middle panel demonstrates fairly good agreement between the two measures based on gas , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "there is some evidence that @xmath16  systematically exceeds @xmath17  by 510 per cent .",
    "statistics are poorer because gas is rare in s0s by definition , but there is no evidence of any systematic difference between @xmath53 in s0s and spirals .",
    "however , the bottom panel of fig .  [ fig : vall ] shows that @xmath19 ( and therefore @xmath18 ) does not in general agree @xmath16 ( and thus @xmath17 ) : @xmath54dex with a rms scatter of 0.115dex ( or @xmath55dex with a rms scatter of 0.243dex if the galaxies are included ) .",
    "some of this difference and scatter is caused by pathological cases of @xmath16  derived from single dish measurements , i.e. spatially unresolved measurements of 21 cm signal from galaxies with a warped gas disc , polar rings or gas - rich nearby companions that fall within the telescope beam ( e.g. this is almost certainly the case for the s0 galaxy ngc  1596 , see @xcite ) .",
    "but even when possible pathological cases are avoided , for example by ignoring s0 galaxies , which are more likely to be problematic , there remains a clear systematic offset : @xmath56dex ( 15 per cent ) with 0.02dex rms scatter for the spirals in our sample .",
    "for these galaxies , the rotational velocity derived from the global line width is significantly and systematically smaller than that derived from stellar kinematics or dynamical modelling . because @xmath16  is derived from spatially unresolved data , this could be explained by the global  line width probing the local gas velocity out to different radii than our typical stellar kinematic data @xcite .",
    "we find a similar systematic difference between @xmath47  ( or @xmath18 ) and @xmath17 : @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath17  is derived from a spatially resolved pvd taken from the same long - slit optical spectrum with which we derive the stellar kinematics .",

    "[ fig : gaspvds ] for the five sample galaxies with optical emission that extends to the disk .",
    "it is clear that the stars and gas are associated with the same galaxy and are observed at similar radii .",
    "therefore , unless light - emitting gas is absent from the tangent point along the line - of - sight in these edge - on galaxies ( a possibility we can not rule out ) , the emission line gas kinematics and absorption line stellar kinematics should imply the same local circular velocity and the same single characteristic measure of rotation , ( @xmath17 , @xmath18  or @xmath47 ) .",
    "but in these five galaxies galaxies , the stars and gas rotate with essentially the same velocity as a function of position in the outer , flat parts of the observed rotation curve .",

    "it is not surprising that @xmath17  is significantly less than @xmath47 .    in summary ,",
    "while agreement between @xmath17  and @xmath16  is fairly good , and from this we conclude that @xmath47 and @xmath18 ( based on stars seen in absorption ) do not imply the same circular velocity as @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( based on gas seen in emission ) .",

    "we see no evidence of this in our data , for any of the four measures explored .",

    "however , we believe that this correction was in error , since the absolute locations of the tp00 tfrs were set by independent cepheid distances , which imply rather than assume a particular value of @xmath141 .",
    "we also show an extrapolation to high mass systems of the baryonic tfr presented in @xcite , which was calibrated using gas - dominated dwarf galaxies ( hence minimizing uncertainties associated with the stellar mass - to - light ratio ) .",
    "neither of our mass estimates @xmath133 or @xmath135 are designed to reproduce the baryonic mass @xmath146 used by @xcite . in practice , however , one expects @xmath147 to within a few per cent for gas - poor s0s and to within perhaps ten per cent for giant sa  sb spirals , while @xmath148 to within a factor of 2 for both s0s and spirals ( dark matter is no more than 50 per cent of the mass within the optical radius of disk galaxies , e.g. @xcite , ) .",
    "the comparison of our stellar and dynamical mass tfrs to the baryonic tfr is therefore meaningful , and we note that the @xcite tfr is broadly consistent with our spirals . the good agreement gives us confidence in our mass models .",
    "it is crucial to emphasize that at no point in our analysis do we do anything that might systematically affect the s0s in the sample differently to the spirals .",
    "one slight but unavoidable observational bias may be introduced by the presence of dust along the major axes .",
    "if the slit is placed exactly on the major axis , then absorption by dust may make it impossible to recover the full line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) . depending on the optical thickness",
    ", this may truncate the low velocity wing or , in very dusty discs , the high velocity peak of the losvds .",
    "when gaussians are fitted to these distribution @xcite , this could therefore increase or , perhaps more likely , decrease the derived line - of - sight velocities .",
    "this effect would propagate into the rotation curves from which @xmath47 and @xmath18 are derived , and also into the mass - to - light ratios inferred in , from which @xmath133 and @xmath135 are derived .",
    "however , in cases where the dust absorption was strong , the slit was simply shifted from the major axis by @xmath36 arcsec to ensure the full losvd was sampled , and the objects with strong dust lanes were selected to be very slightly away from perfectly edge - on @xcite .",
    "if the rotational velocity is a strong function of @xmath149 , the height above the equatorial plane in the cylindrical coordinate system of the galaxy @xmath21 , this intentional shift could itself bias the velocities and inferred masses in dustier galaxies ( i.e. spirals ) . in a future work ( williams et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , we will present pseudo - integral - field data ( i.e. a sparse velocity fields constructed from multiple long - slit positions ) for six of the galaxies in the present sample . in these data",

    "this is broadly consistent with observations of planetary nebulae in the edge - on spiral ngc  891 @xcite and of extraplanar gas ( e.g. ngc  891 , @xcite , @xcite ; ngc  4302 and ngc  5775 , @xcite ; the milky way , @xcite ) , which find a typical falloff in rotation @xmath152kms@xmath5kpc@xmath5 in the worst case scenario , in which all our spirals ( and none of the s0s ) suffered from absorption strong enough to require shifting the slit , the spiral velocities would typically be biased by @xmath153dex .",
    "we estimate that the overall effect on our sample of spirals , most of which did not require this slit shift , may be to bias their velocities by up to @xmath154dex . in practice ,",
    "the slit was 1.8 arcsec wide and rather difficult to align precisely for both spirals and s0s .",
    "this imprecision , which introduces velocity scatter in both samples , likely overwhelms any systematic velocity falloff in the spirals due to intentionally shifting the slit .",

    "observationally , this possibility appears to be ruled out by high - redshift observations : while @xcite show that the s0 fraction has risen at the expense of spirals since @xmath246 ( 5gyr ago ) , @xcite find that the present relative fraction of s0s and spirals was largely already in place in clusters at @xmath247 ( 2.5gyr ago ) and there was no shortage of s0s in groups at @xmath248 ( 4gyr ago , @xcite ) . in the absence of strong environmental processes , we naively expect the transformation of field spirals to s0s to be gradual , and therefore that present day field s0s would need to have begun their transformation even earlier .",
    "we therefore conclude that a simple scenario of passive fading of spirals into s0s is inconsistent with the tfrs of our sample and the evolution of the s0/spiral fraction with redshift .",
    "this interpretation of the offset of the s0 tfr is consistent with that of @xcite . with limited data they measured a very similar s0 tfr offset to us , but with much larger uncertainties , and with respect to a line width - based tfr (",
    "a comparison we argue is flawed in section  [ sec : rotation ] ) .",
    "we now discuss the possibility that the zero - point of the tfr was fainter at earlier times .",
    "if the @xmath140-band spiral tfr has evolved with redshift and was , for example , 0.66mag fainter at @xmath238 than the local relation ( as found by @xcite ) , then present - day s0s are approximately as luminous at a given rotational velocity as spirals were 6gyr ago , i.e. there is no evidence for any evolution in the velocity  luminosity plane between local s0s and their presumed high redshift progenitors .",
    "a simple star formation truncation scenario is then even harder to reconcile with our results .",

    "we have gone on to consider in isolation the evolution of a single broadband colour .",
    "the parameter space of possible star formation histories is , however , highly degenerate and this is far from the ideal way to constrain star formation histories .",
    "it is nevertheless clear from our sample that something other than simple fading beginning at the redshifts at which s0s are first observed ( and without subsequent star formation ) , is transforming spirals to s0s .",
    "the evidence for recent ( and even ongoing ) star formation in local s0s from uv @xcite and mid - infrared @xcite observations is in fact strong .",
    "we also detect a significant difference between the zero points of the s0 and spiral stellar mass tfrs .",
    "the s0s have around 0.2dex less stellar mass for a given rotational velocity than the spirals .",
    "because of the relative gas richness of spirals , the offset in the baryonic relation ( i.e. stellar mass @xmath249 gas mass , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is likely larger and certainly no smaller . assuming that @xmath47 traces the enclosed dynamical mass equally well for s0s and spirals",
    ", this might naively suggest that s0s have less stellar mass per dynamical mass within 23 ( the extent of our kinematic data ) , and therefore contain fractionally more dark matter than spirals .",
    "this is generally consistent with the idea that s0s are older systems that are found in denser environments at the bottom of deeper potential wells .",
    "if this is indeed the case , using dynamical rather than stellar mass should eliminate the offset .",
    "the dynamical mass tfr is essentially a plot of a one measure of dynamical mass ( from a mass model ) against another ( the observed rotational velocity ) , and since gravity applies equally to spirals and s0s there should be no difference .",
    "having said that , the difference between the spiral and s0 zero points persists almost unchanged in the dynamical mass tfr ( see table  [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "our dynamical modelling approach does necessarily make approximations and assumptions , but it is unlikely that the models could be systematically biased by morphological type .",
    "our stellar and dynamical mass spiral tfrs are also consistent with the reliably calibrated baryonic tfr of @xcite .",
    "this raises the possibility that s0s are systematically smaller or more concentrated than spirals .",
    "recall that @xmath250 , where @xmath12 is some characteristic radius .",
    "if @xmath12 is systematically smaller in s0s at a given rotational velocity , or if the dynamical mass is more concentrated such that more mass is enclosed within a given characteristic radius , then that could explain the offset in the dynamical mass tfr .",
    "in other words , spirals and s0s do not form a homologous family . in this scenario ,",
    "the offset of the s0 dynamical mass tfr should not be thought of as a -0.18dex offset in mass ( as presented in table  [ tab : params ] ) , but , because of the slope of the tfr , a + 0.05dex offset in velocity .",
    "this could be due either to s0s being approximately 80% of the size of spirals of the same rotational velocity , or their dynamical mass being distributed more compactly such that the characteristic radius probed by measures like @xmath47 and @xmath18 contains approximately 25% more dynamical mass .",
    "again , since s0s are thought to be older , more evolved systems with bulge - to - disc ratios that are larger on average than those of spirals , this is perhaps consistent with naive expectations , but is it true for our sample ? in the spirit of @xcite and @xcite , the possibility that the luminous component of the dynamical mass is smaller or more concentrated in s0s at a given velocity can be tested directly by measuring the size of our galaxies .",
    "we define @xmath29 as described in section  [ sec : defined ] ( where it is used as a parameter of the asymmetric drift correction ) and as the semi - major axis of the ellipse containing half the light at @xmath1-band ( see section 4.2 of for a discussion of alternative definitions ) . in an edge - on galaxy with a boxy bulge , such as those in our sample ,",

    ", we find that s0s are on average @xmath253dex smaller than spirals at a given @xmath47 .",
    "this result is of weak statistical significance , but is consistent with our interpretation .",
    "we see no significant difference between the mean compactness of the light distribution , @xmath254 , of the s0s and spirals .",
    "@xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the semi - major axis of the ellipse containing 80% of the light .",
    "the large sample of @xcite does not include s0s , but extends from sa to sc and is made up of galaxies that are more favourably inclined for measurements of size .",
    "recalling that @xmath1-band luminosity is a good proxy for stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is a reasonable proxy for dynamical mass in the optical parts of disc galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite find a morphological trend in the sense required to explain our result : earlier - type spirals are smaller for a given @xmath1-band luminosity than later - types ( see their table 3 and figure 11 ) .",
    "at a characteristic @xmath1-band luminosity of @xmath257 , they find that sas are around 80% the size of sbs , which are in turn around 80% the size of scs .",
    "if this trend extends to s0s , then its sense and magnitude are consistent with the offset we see in our dynamical mass tfr .",
    "there is also the possibility that the dark halos ( rather than the baryonic mass distribution ) of s0s are smaller or more concentrated than those of spirals .",
    "unfortunately we are unable to quantify this with our kinematic data , which are not radially extended enough to break the well known degeneracy between halo mass and concentration @xcite",
    ". however , the inability of the dynamical models presented in to quantify the amount of halo contraction has no effect on the results presented here .",
    "this is because , even if one assumes different dark halo shapes , the parameters of the best fitting models always conspire to produce an almost unchanging @xmath258 profile in the region constrained by the data .",
    "this is ultimately the reason why the degeneracy exists in the first place .",
    "a quantitative illustration of the robustness of the circular velocity profiles recovered from dynamical models to the degeneracy in the halo concentration is given in , e.g. , fig .",
    "9 of @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the systematic offset of the s0 tfr to higher velocities due to a more concentrated mass distribution or smaller size than spirals is consistent with the discussion of the shapes of very extended gas rotation curves in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their kinematic data extend well beyond the optical discs of the galaxies , and allow them to study the asymptotic behaviour of the rotation curves .",
    "they find that the earlier galaxies in their sample of s0sab galaxies have rotation curves that reach a maximum that is greater than their asymptotic velocity and occurs at smaller radii .",
    "they argue that this behaviour can be understood in terms of the larger bulge - to - disc ratios of the earlier - type galaxies in their sample .",
    "the scatter of their earlier - type galaxies away from the tfr of the late type galaxies is reduced by using the asymptotic velocity , which again suggests the tully - fisher relation is a manifestation of a close connection between galaxy luminosity ( or mass ) and halo mass .    if the size / concentration argument discussed above",
    "is indeed the explanation for the difference between the zero points of the s0 and spiral tfrs as a function of dynamical mass , then the offsets we observe as a function of luminosity ( and discuss extensively in section  [ sec : lumdisc ] in the context of fading relative to the high - redshift spiral tfr ) are in fact due to differences in the distributions of dynamical mass in spirals and s0s .",
    "the offset between spirals and s0s in the tully - fisher ( luminosity  velocity ) relation may therefore not be a property of their stellar populations as argued in , but rather the result of more fundamental offset between spirals and s0s in the mass  size ( or luminosity  size ) projections of the luminosity  size  velocity plane occupied by disc galaxies .",
    "models of s0 formation in which s0s are end points of spiral evolution should consider this possibility .",
    "the @xmath11-band luminosities we use , which are drawn from hyperleda , are less accurate than our @xmath1-band magnitudes , which are based on a relatively recent , homogeneous set of observations .",
    "the extinction corrections at @xmath11-band are also particularly large and uncertain for edge - on galaxies like ours .",
    "these uncertainties are probably not reflected properly in our error estimates , and this may contribute to the fact that the scatter of the tfr at @xmath11-band ( @xmath259mag , of which @xmath260mag is intrinsic rather than observational ) is larger than that at @xmath1-band ( @xmath261mag , of which @xmath262mag is intrinsic ) .",
    "these scatters are broadly consistent with dedicated studies of the spiral tfr scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is perhaps somewhat surprising given the expected poor quality of our distance estimates and the importance and uncertainty of internal extinction in edge - on spirals .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that such studies fit a single line to a range of morphological types , while we separately fit two lines to two sub - samples , which reduces the measured total and intrinsic scatters .",
    "if a single line is fitted to the composite sample of spirals and s0s then the scatter increases to 0.50mag , of which 0.41mag is intrinsic .    because our sample is drawn from a wide range of environments , the s0s may have been transformed from spirals via multiple channels ( or one channel which began at different times in different galaxies ) .",
    "if so , then the extent to which s0s have left the spiral tfr should vary , and their scatter about the tfr should be larger than that of spirals .",
    "our fitting method implicitly assumes that spirals and s0s have the same intrinsic scatter .",
    "however , our analysis also shows that there is no evidence of any difference between the intrinsic or total scatter of spiral galaxies about their line of best fit and that of s0s about theirs .",
    "the absence of increased scatter in the s0 tfr is problematic for all explanations of the offset ( passive fading , environmental stripping , minor mergers and the possible non - homology described in section  [ sec : massdisc ] ) .",
    "there is no significant difference between the total scatters of the stellar mass tfrs ( 0.13dex , i.e. 35 per cent ) and the scatter at @xmath1-band ( 0.32mag , i.e 34 per cent in luminosity ) .",
    "this is probably due to the relative constancy of mass - to - light ratios in the near - infrared , from which the masses are derived .",
    "the difficulty of assigning errors to the total masses of the dynamical models makes drawing strong conclusions from the intrinsic scatter of the stellar mass or dynamical mass tfrs difficult .",
    "the ability to reproducibly and correctly distinguish between spiral and s0 galaxies is crucial for this work .",
    "although spirals arms are not visible in edge - on disc galaxies , the classification of edge - on galaxies as spirals or s0s is clearly specified by the presence of extended dust ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear , therefore , that the classification of edge - on galaxies is objective and reproducible .",
    "although the classification of edge - on disc galaxies is reproducible , would a galaxy be classified as the same type if viewed face - on ? to answer this concern , we note that if the effects of dust are visible in a face - on spiral then , due to line - of - sight projection , they would be even clearer if the same galaxy were viewed edge - on . for the simple distinction between spiral and s0 galaxies ( rather than more detailed division into the sa  sd classes based on bulge size and the tightness of spiral arms ) , edge - on orientation is thus arguably the optimal viewing angle .",
    "this is also true of the distinction between s0s and ellipticals , where a face - on orientation makes it extremely difficult to detect the featureless stellar disc of an s0 .",
    "having said that , it is clear that if an edge - on galaxy has just enough dust to be classified as a spiral , it would probably ( but perhaps wrongly ) be classified as an s0 if viewed face - on .",

    "s0 division based on the presence of dust is dynamically significant . to test this , we randomly divided the complete sample of 28 galaxies into two sub - samples of 14 galaxies each and then measured the offset @xmath159 between the zero points of the tfrs of the two random sub - samples .",
    "we repeated this procedure 50,000 times to build up an idea of how the offset between randomly selected sub - samples is distributed , and how exceptional the adopted morphological classification is .",
    "this idea is a simplification of the non - parametric test presented in the context of comparing local and high - redshift tfrs by @xcite .",
    "our results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : randsample ] .",
    "it is clear that the offsets observed between our s0s and spirals can not to be due to chance . in all cases ( @xmath263 , @xmath62 , @xmath133 or @xmath135 , and for both forward and inverse regressions ) ,",
    "the observed offset is at least three standard deviations away from the mean of the offsets between randomly selected sub - samples .",
    "this result clearly demonstrates that a purely morphological classification of edge - on early - type disc galaxies , based only on the presence of dust , divides them into two truly kinematically distinct classes .",
    "the absolute location of our s0 tfr is almost identical to that measured in at both @xmath1 and @xmath11-band .",
    "they used @xmath18 rather than @xmath47 , so this is a reflection of the consistency of these two measures of rotation .",
    "if could have used our spiral tfr as a reference zero point , they would have measured the same offset as us .",
    "however , they used the tfrs of tp00 . as a result ,",
    "our offsets are in the same sense ( s0s are fainter than spirals ) but significantly smaller in size than those measured in ( 1.0@xmath1860.4mag at @xmath1 , 1.6@xmath1860.4mag at @xmath11-band , where we have removed their correction of the tp00 zero point ) . because the zero - point offsets we measure are smaller than those in , the timescale for a simple synthetic stellar population with a plausible star formation history to fade is shorter too .",
    "there are at least two reasons for the larger offsets measured in , which could combine to account for the entirety of the difference , making our results consistent .",
    "the first is the possible intrinsic difference between the zero point of the spiral tfr we compare our s0s to in the present work , and the spiral tfr used in .",
    "our spiral tfr is constructed using sa and sb galaxies , while that of tp00 , which is used by , is calibrated using later types ( mostly sbc and later ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite , in the velocity domain of the present work ( @xmath264kms@xmath5 ) , sa spirals are @xmath7mag fainter than sb and sc spirals of the same rotational velocity . on the other hand , @xcite estimate that sas are just 0.1mag fainter than sbs",
    "indeed , with our much smaller statistics , we see no evidence of a zero point variation between the sa and sb galaxies in our sample .    the second possible effect is the systematic bias introduced by comparing an s0 tfr derived from stellar kinematics to a spiral tfr derived from global line widths .",
    "comparing the methods shows that sa  sb galaxies are measured to be rotating @xmath265dex slower in than in their stellar kinematics ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vall ] ) . at a typical @xmath1-band tfr slope of @xmath266",
    ", this corresponds to a magnitude shift of @xmath267mag .",
    "however , as we emphasized in section  [ sec : rotation ] , applying a constant shift to correct for the difference between stellar and rotation measures is dubious because of the large scatter in this difference ( admittedly less so for spirals ) .",
    "it is easy to see how morphological differences between galaxies in the reference spiral samples could combine with the systematic bias introduced by the use of different measures of rotation to account for the discrepancy between the fiducial offset presented here ( @xmath0mag ) and that in ( @xmath268mag ) .",
    "another possible source of bias in the offset measured in is the fact that the tp00 spiral tfr is constrained by observations of a sample of relatively low mass spirals with @xmath4kms@xmath5 , while s s0s have a mean @xmath8kms@xmath5 . if the slope of the tfr changes with mass , as has been suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the fact that the s0s and spirals in our sample lie in the same velocity domain is a crucial advantage .    in any case , because the rotation measure bias is unphysical and unrelated to the formation and evolution of s0s , we argue that the method we have employed here should be preferred if the goal is to determine how much fainter local s0s are than local spirals .",
    "finally , we note that found a much larger scatter in their s0 tfr than we do here , @xmath269mag at @xmath1-band .",
    "this may be explained by the relatively homogeneous nature of our data compared to the multiple sources from which drew theirs , and perhaps to the larger velocity and luminosity ranges their data probe .",
    "we have demonstrated that the comparison of tully - fisher relations derived from line widths , ionized gas pvds , stellar kinematics corrected for asymmetric drift or the circular velocity profiles of dynamical models is influenced by systematic and uncertain biases introduced by the different measures of rotation used .",
    "we therefore argue that to constrain the relative locations of the spiral and s0 tfrs , the same tracer and methods must be used for both samples . in practice , because of the paucity of extended , undisturbed and ionised gas in s0s , this means one must use stellar kinematics or dynamical models .    in this work we used the circular velocity profiles of mass models to construct tfrs for 14 sa ",
    "sb spirals and 14 s0s , eliminating the biases introduced by mixing measures of rotation .",
    "the circular velocity curves are those of models derived by solving the jeans equations for mass models comprising an axisymmetric stellar component and a spherical nfw halo .",
    "the parameters of the models are constrained by observed long - slit major - axis stellar kinematics @xcite .",
    "we characterized the circular velocity profile for each galaxy by single numbers , @xmath47 , by taking the average in the flat part of the observed rotation curve .    by simultaneously fitting two offset relations with a common slope to this",

    "sb spirals of the same rotational velocity .",
    "this measurement is almost identical if we use estimates of the rotational velocity derived from ionized gas pvds or stellar kinematics corrected for asymmetric drift .",
    "if the high - redshift spiral tfr has the same zero point as the local spiral tfr , this is inconsistent with the observed evolution of the spiral / s0 fraction with redshift and a simple scenario in which star formation in the spiral progenitors of s0s was truncated at some time in the past .",
    "more complex star formation histories or even ongoing star formation in s0s may be the explanation .",
    "an alternative interpretation is revealed by the stellar mass and dynamical mass tfrs .",
    "the tfr offset persists as a function of both stellar and dynamical mass , and we show that this may be evidence of a small ( 1020% ) but systematic contraction of spirals as they transform to s0s .",
    "this is consistent with the trend with morphological type of the size ",
    "luminosity relation in the local universe @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , the zero point of the tfr has dimmed from the present day to high redshift by @xmath270mag , then the putative transformation from spirals to s0s involves essentially no movement in the velocity  luminosity plane .",
    "it seems clear that s0s are not primeval objects , but are an end point of spiral evolution .",

    "the variation of the zero point of the tfr with galaxy type and other parameters is just one approach among a number available that will allow us to constrain s0 formation and evolution .",

    "the first is to multiply the @xmath1-band luminosity @xmath271 by the dynamical mass - to - light ratio @xmath136 ( taken from for our galaxies ) .",
    "as we noted , this method is relatively straightforward , and we adopt it as our fiducial method in the main body of this paper ( denoting it @xmath135 ) .",
    "this quantity does not have a precise physical meaning , but here we show it is equal , to a good approximation , to @xmath272 , where @xmath138 is the dynamical mass contained within the three - dimensional half - light volume .",

    "the behaviour of the @xcite profile is shown in solid purple .",
    "the other lines are srsic profiles of order @xmath279 ( exponential ) , 2.5 ( typical classical bulge  pseudobulge transition ) , 4 ( de vaucouleurs ) and 10 . the de vaucouleurs and hernquist lines are well described by the fitting formula @xmath280.,width=317 ]    disc galaxies are not spherically symmetric , so a more useful definition in these cases is the dynamical mass within an oblate spheroid of semi - major axis @xmath273 , which we denote @xmath281 . for a given circular velocity , @xmath282",
    "this is because the mass that must be spherically distributed to maintain a given circular velocity is larger than that necessary to achieve the same circular velocity in the midplane of a flattened system .",
    "the ratio @xmath283 is simultaneously a function of the radial profile of the mass distribution and @xmath278 . for a full analytic discussion",
    "see , for example , the comparison between the circular velocities of oblate spheroids as a function of @xmath278 and mass profile in section 2.5.2 of @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "an approximate estimate of @xmath283 is sufficient . using a range of analytic potentials , we examine the behaviour of the ratio @xmath283 as a function of @xmath278 in fig .",

    "the circular velocity of each flattened model is conveniently calculated numerically by flattening a multi - gaussian fit to the mass distribution and using standard integrals to determine the circular velocity of the arbitrarily flattened distribution @xcite .",

    "so from equation  ( [ eqn : mhalf ] ) @xmath288 furthermore , @xmath289 , where in non - spherical systems the observable is defined as the semi - major axis of the projected half - light ellipse . for disc galaxies we can therefore write @xmath290    the circular velocity at 1.33 can easily be estimated to an accuracy consistent with the derivation of this formula from dynamical modelling , stellar kinematics corrected for asymmetric drift or resolved gas kinematic observations . for typical values of @xmath278 and the analytic potentials explored here , this expression is accurate to about 15 per cent .",
    "of course in real disc galaxies , the flattening @xmath278 is a function of radius , the potential is not described by a single srsic or hernquist profile and even is not simple to measure , so equation  ( [ eqn : newmhalf ] ) is probably a little less reliable in practice .     as defined in equation  ( [ eqn : newmhalf ] ) , incorporating an approximate correction for flattening .",

    "the excellent agreement between @xmath294 and @xmath295 may be a coincidence .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the comparison of tully - fisher relations ( tfrs ) derived from global line widths to tfrs derived from the circular velocity profiles of dynamical models ( or stellar kinematic observations corrected for asymmetric drift ) is vulnerable to systematic and uncertain biases introduced by the different measures of rotation used . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore argue that to constrain the relative locations of the tfrs of spiral and s0 galaxies , the same tracer and measure must be used for both samples . using detailed near - infrared imaging and the circular velocities of axisymmetric jeans models of 14 nearby edge - on sa  sb spirals and 14 nearby edge - on s0s drawn from a range of environments , we find that s0s lie on a tfr with the same slope as the spirals , but are on average @xmath0mag fainter at @xmath1-band at a given rotational velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this is a significantly smaller offset than that measured in earlier studies of the s0 tfr , which we attribute to our elimination of the bias associated with using different rotation measures and our use of earlier type spirals as a reference . </S>",
    "<S> since our measurement of the offset avoids systematic biases , it should be preferred to previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> a spiral stellar population in which star formation is truncated would take @xmath2gyr to fade by 0.53mag at @xmath1-band . </S>",
    "<S> if s0s are the products of a simple truncation of star formation in spirals , then this finding is difficult to reconcile with the observed evolution of the spiral / s0 fraction with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> recent star formation could explain the observed lack of fading in s0s , but the offset of the s0 tfr persists as a function of both stellar and dynamical mass . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the offset of the s0 tfr could therefore be explained by a systematic difference between the total mass distributions of s0s and spirals , in the sense that s0s need to be smaller or more concentrated than spirals .    </S>",
