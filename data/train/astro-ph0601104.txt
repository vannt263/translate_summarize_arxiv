    "the nature of the x - ray source rx j1914 + 24 has been the subject of much debate in recent years .",
    "only one modulation period ( 569 sec ) has been seen in both its x - ray and optical light curves ( ramsay et al 2000 ) . for this , and other reasons , the period of 569 sec has been taken to be the binary orbital period , which would make it the second most compact binary system known .",
    "the models which have been put forward to explain the observational characteristics of rx j1914 + 24 fall into two broad categories : accretion and non - accretion driven models .",
    "the fact that the optical spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 ( also known as v407 vul ) shows no emission lines , puts a question mark over the accretion driven models .",
    "the non - accreting model is the unipolar - inductor ( ui ) model of wu et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "while this model has been able to explain many of the observed characteristics of this source , it appears that its x - ray luminosity implies an induction torque which is much greater than the amount generated by gravitational radiation .",
    "there is some evidence that the observed spin - up rate of rx j1914 + 24 ( strohmayer 2002 , 2004b , ramsay et al 2005a ) is therefore much smaller than that predicted by the ui model ( marsh & nelemans 2005 ) .",
    "this conclusion is based on the x - ray luminosity determined using _ rosat _ ( cropper et al 1998 ) and _ xmm - newton _ observations ( ramsay et al 2005a )",
    ". the _ rosat _",
    "data were well fitted using an absorbed blackbody model while the higher signal to noise data of _ xmm - newton _ found a poor fit using this model .",
    "ramsay et al ( 2005a ) found the best fit to the data could be achieved using an absorbed blackbody plus gaussian model , although they did not expect that this model was physically realistic .    since those first _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations were made in nov 2003 , a further two sets of observations made in sept / oct 2004 have become publically available .",
    "these observations were longer than the initial _ xmm - newton _ observations and the particle background was lower .",
    "in addition , a further set of x - ray observations of rx j1914 + 24 made using _",
    "chandra _ has become publically available .",
    "we have therefore extracted these data from the archive and use them to make a more detailed investigation of its x - ray spectrum , to determine if the 569 sec is continuing to spin - up at the same rate and to search for evidence for periods other than the 569 sec period .",
    "rx j1914 + 24 was observed twice using _ xmm - newton _ in nov 2003 .",
    "the details of these observations has been reported by ramsay et al ( 2005a ) .",
    "it was observed again late in 2004 and we show in table [ log ] the start time , duration and mean x - ray count rate of the second epoch _",

    "we discuss the data collected using the epic x - ray detectors ( pn and mos ) which are sensitive over the energy band 0.15 - 10kev .",

    "chandra _ on 5 occasions were reported by strohmayer ( 2004b ) . since then",
    "another 3 observations have entered the archive .",
    "all of these observations were made in continuous clocking mode : in this mode a one - dimensional image of the sky is produced .",
    "we have extracted all of the available data from the archive and corrected and analysed them in a similar manner to that carried out by strohmayer ( 2004b ) .",
    "ramsay et al ( 2005a ) folded all available x - ray data ( _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) on the best fit initial period of strohmayer ( 2004b ) ( ie without the period derivative ) and found that the sharp rise of the x - ray flux arrives earlier in phase over time .",
    "a best fit to the data showed that rx j1914 + 24 is spinning up at a rate of 3.2@xmath3 s / s , which was similar to that reported by strohmayer ( 2002 , 2004b ) .",
    "we did the same analysis as done in ramsay et al ( 2005a ) and show the phase of the rise in x - ray flux for the _ chandra _ data taken in april 2004 and the new _ xmm - newton _ data in figure [ rise ] .",
    "we find a best fit of @xmath4 s / s ( the error being determined using a bootstrap method ) , which is consistent with the value we determined previously .",
    "( 6,5.5 ) ( -2.8,-7 )",
    "strohmayer ( 2004b ) detected sideband structure in the power spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 in observations made using _",
    "chandra _ but concluded that this was likely to have been caused by the dithering pattern of those observations .",
    "on the other hand , longer term variations have been seen in x - ray data ( ramsay et al 2000 , strohmayer 2004b ) .",
    "( 7,13 ) ( -1.,-0.4 )    we have searched for evidence of periods other than the 569 sec period in these new x - ray data .",
    "we performed a discrete fourier transform ( dft ) on the combined data taken in _ xmm - newton _ orbits 0718 and 0721 and also orbits 0880 and 0882 as well as each of the _ chandra _ observations . as expected , the 569 sec period and its harmonics were seen strongly in all the amplitude spectra .",
    "to pre - whiten the data we used two methods : we pre - whitened in the usual manner using a sinusoid at predicted period at the observation epoch ( based on the initial period of strohmayer ( 2004b ) and the spin - up rate reported here ) .",
    "we also pre - whitened the data by subtracting the mean x - ray pulse profile appropriate to each individual observation .",
    "the latter is more appropriate since the x - ray pulse profile is non - sinusoidal . as expected most of the peaks",
    "are removed after this procedure . however , in the second epoch set of _ xmm - newton _ data ( 0880 and 0882 ) , side - band structure is clearly present at 584.1 sec and 552.8 sec in the pre - whitened spectrum ( figure [ prewhite ] ) .",
    "they are located in the wings of the main peak in the original amplitude spectrum and have an amplitude of @xmath51/10 of the main peak . in the earlier _ xmm - newton _ data ( 0718 and 0721 )",
    "there is only weak evidence of these periods . in the _ chandra _ dataset of 2004 june 13",
    "we also find strong evidence for periods very similar to those seen in the _ xmm - newton _ data ( figure [ prewhite ] ) . in two others , ( 2004 jan 31 and 2004 sept 5 ) there are peaks in the amplitude spectra which correspond to these periods , although they are only marginally significant compared to other peaks in the spectra .",
    "there is no evidence for these periods in the longest _ chandra _ dataset which lasted 35 ksec .",
    "we also determined how the x - ray pulse profile changed over the individual observation duration .",
    "we find that the mean profile brightens over the duration of both the 0880 and the 0882 observations .",
    "we believe that 553 and 584 sec periods could result when a modulation signal ( ie the 569 sec period ) is mixed with another longer term variation ( either a periodic or non - periodic modulation ) .",
    "_ if _ it was a periodic modulation , then its period would be the difference between the 569 sec period and the 553 and 584 sec periods : just over 6 hrs .",
    "alternatively if a modulation signal is mixed with either a 553 sec or 584 sec period then this would give rise to the longer term trend in the data .",
    "the question remains if this longer term trend is periodic or due to the secular variability that have already been observed in this system : we discuss this further in  [ discussion ] .",
    "ramsay et al ( 2005a ) showed the x - ray spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 was poorly modelled using an absorbed blackbody model .",
    "their best fit was obtained using an absorbed blackbody plus a broad gaussian line near 0.6kev .",
    "this fit was still poor ( = 1.63 ) and the model was unlikely to be physically realistic .    with the better quality data afforded by the new _ xmm - newton _ data we have re - visited the x - ray spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 .",
    "we fitted the epic - pn data from _ xmm - newton _ orbits 0880 and 0882 separately . given the unphysical nature of the previous fits and working from the satisfactory fits to our x - ray observations of other compact binaries ( the am cvn stars , ramsay et al 2005b ) we tried fitting the spectra with an absorbed thermal plasma model with variable elemental abundance ( vmekal in xspec ) .",
    "this model still gave a poor fit to the data ( = 4.6 for the 0880 data ) .",
    "however , when we added an edge to the model we obtained a good fit to the 0880 data ( = 0.97 , 122 dof ; figure [ spec_fit ] ) .",
    "the fit to the 0882 data using the same model was slightly poorer ( = 1.21 , 141 dof ) .",
    "elements which were required in the fit include n , o , ne , ca , fe for the 0880 data , with some evidence for na in the 0882 data . the edge is located at 0.83kev which is consistent with it being due to oviii .",
    "the absorption derived from the fits is @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "we note we can not obtain a good fit with this model when we fix the absorption at 8.3@xmath8 @xmath7 , the larger value determined from optical interstellar absorption features ( steeghs et al 2006 ) .",
    "the observed flux in the 0.1 - 10kev energy band ( 1.30@xmath3 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath7for the orbit 0880 data and 1.48@xmath3 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath7for the orbit 0882 data ) is very similar to that found using the blackbody plus gaussian line of ramsay et al ( 2005a ) .",
    "however , the unabsorbed bolometric flux in the fit presented here ( 1.14@xmath9 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath7 ; 0880 and 1.24@xmath9 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath7 ; 0882 ) is substantially reduced compared to the earlier results ( 3.2@xmath10 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath7 ) where a blackbody spectrum was used .    ( 6,6 ) ( -2,-0.8 )",
    "until now there has been no convincing evidence for any other periods in rx j1914 + 24 apart from the 569 sec period . in the case of 5 x - ray observations we have found evidence for power at 552 and 584 sec .",
    "this changes our perception of rx j1914 + 24 .",
    "the data are clear - the x - ray flux clearly increases in the _ xmm - newton _ data taken in both orbit 0880 and in orbit 0882 .",
    "this could be considered to be the result of an underlying @xmath56 hour period , or it could be the result of secular variability known already in this system at longer timescales ( ramsay et al 2000 , strohmayer 2004b ) . both could produce the observed amplitude spectrum .    to explore this question ,",
    "we have obtained the mean x - ray flux in each of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations . since the _ chandra _ acis - i detector has a low effective area at energies less than @xmath50.4kev , we determined the observed mean flux in the 0.4 - 1.0kev energy band .",
    "we show how the flux in this band varies over time in figure [ long_term ] .",
    "we also show those epochs at which we detected the 552 sec and 584 sec periods which could be signatures of a longer period trend in the observation .",
    "although not conclusive , it appears that at the higher flux levels there is no ( or weak ) evidence of these other periods , so that shorter ( @xmath111 day ) timescale variations may take place only when the system is emitting at intermediate or low levels .",
    "the detection of power at 552 and 584 sec does not appear to be related to the observation length since the longest observation ( the _ chandra _ observation of feb 2003 which lasted 35 ksec ) did not show obvious power at these periods .    at this stage",
    ", we can not distinguish between the x - ray long term behaviour being due to random changes in either the accretion rate ( in the case of the accreting models ) or the electrical current dissipation ( in the case of the unipolar - inductor model ) .",
    "we urge the search for radial velocity variations on a timescale of less than 1 day , or dedicated x - ray and/or optical observations of this system to search for variations on this period .    _ if _ the longer term variation in the x - ray flux is periodic , then we showed earlier that its period would approximately be 6 hrs .",
    "smith & dhillon ( 1998 ) show that for a binary system with this orbital period then its spectral type would be expected to be a mid k - type , although the range is up to 5 sub - classes .",
    "we note with interest the discovery of steeghs et al ( 2006 ) of features in the optical spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 which appear to resemble a g9/k0 spectral type .",
    "therefore , an orbital period of 6 hrs would be marginally consistent with this .",
    "( 6,6 ) ( -2,-0.3 )      we have shown that the derived luminosity of rx j1914 + 24 is highly model dependent .",
    "further , the distance to rx j1914 + 24 is still rather uncertain , but steeghs et al ( 2006 ) suggest a distance of 1kpc based on its optical spectrum . for a distance of 1kpc the mean bolometric luminosity from the _",
    "xmm - newton _ orbits 0880 and 0882 data is therefore 1.4@xmath12 ergs s@xmath1- an order of magnitude lower than the previous luminosity of 3.8@xmath13 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "ramsay et al ( 2005a ) went further and applied a correction to account for projection affects giving a luminosity of @xmath14 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "since the new model is an optically thin plasma , a correction effect for projection is now no longer applicable .",
    "moreover , absorption derived from the x - ray fits is @xmath515% of that derived from the optical data of steeghs et al ( 2006 ) based on a g9 spectral type .",
    "if the g star is not the secondary , then we can reduce the distance by a similar factor and the luminosity is therefore 3@xmath15 ergs s@xmath1 . in this case ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity of rx j1914 + 24 is more than @xmath53 orders of magnitude less than that found by ramsay et al ( 2005a ) .    in the unipolar - inductor model of wu",
    "et al ( 2002 ) the amount of power which is emitted is determined by various factors , with the degree of asynchronisity being one of the key determinants ( along with component masses and magnetic field strength ) .",
    "however , to produce the observed luminosity , the asynchronisity would have to be 0.001 or less ( wu et al 2002 ) .",
    "this reduces the objections to the ui model on energetic grounds raised by marsh & nelemans ( 2005 ) to a significant degree .",
    "the abundances are clearly non - solar , which is consistent for an evolved secondary as is seen in the fits to spectra of am cvn systems ( eg marsh , horne & rosen 1991 , strohmayer 2004a , ramsay et al 2005b ) .",
    "if this model reflects the properties of the material leaving the secondary star then it rules out the g9/k0 star seen in the optical spectrum being the secondary star .",
    "this is work based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data were extracted from the archive at vilspa and the _ chandra _ data from the heasarc archive at goddard space flight center .",
