    "the knowledge of nuclear reactions is crucial to model the evolution of stars and to determine the amounts of produced nuclei . from the abundance patterns of the elements we can learn something about how they were created and consequently it is possible to study the conditions in supposed astrophysical sites and , finally , to attempt to trace the origin and history of the universe .",
    "an in - depth knowledge of the sub - atomic processes is required in order to understand many large - scale effects .",
    "the demands of astrophysics challenge our ability to describe and predict nuclear properties and nuclear reactions . due to high temperatures and densities in the stellar plasma , a large number of unstable nuclides",
    "are involved in the nucleosynthetic processes . some of their radioactive decay lines can be observed by modern satellite observatories and provide an important tool to test the hydrodynamics of stellar models by comparison .",
    "however , this task can only be performed if the producing nuclear reactions are sufficiently well known . in this respect ,",
    "not only reactions involving unstable targets are important but also such along the line of stability . despite of temperatures in the range of millions to billions of kelvin , the respective energies of the interacting particles are quite low by nuclear physics standards , from thermal energies up to a few mev . due to the size of the reaction networks (",
    "the nucleosynthesis calculations for massive stars , which are described below , include about 2400 nuclides in more than 15000 reactions ) , theoretical predictions will always remain important",
    ". however , the relevance of the low - energy region poses problems to both experimental and theoretical approaches . for neutron - induced reactions , to resolve the transition between and interplay of different reaction mechanisms  from direct to resonant interactions and finally to the hauser - feshbach regime  remains a challenge .",
    "except for activation experiments , standard techniques only measure the resonant part of the cross section . on the other hand , energy and strength of resonances are difficult to predict with the required accuracy",
    "the situation is somewhat improved whenever the statistical model of nuclear reactions ( hauser - feshbach theory ) can be applied , which uses resonance averages . fortunately , the majority of reactions in astrophysics involving the strong interaction can be described in this approach  @xcite . when predicting cross sections for astrophysical applications in such a way , slightly different points are emphasized than in pure nuclear physics investigations .",
    "since most of the ingredients for the calculations are experimentally undetermined ( in some cases even for nuclides at or close to stability ) , one has to develop reliable phenomenological or microscopic models to predict these properties with an acceptable accuracy across the nuclear chart .",
    "therein one has to be satisfied with a more limited accuracy as compared to usual nuclear physics standards .",
    "considering the substantially larger uncertainties in many astrophysical scenarios , this seems to be adequate . for certain selected reactions , however , the sensitivity of the astrophysical results is so high that an accuracy of 10% or better is necessary .",
    "examples of this are the reactions @xmath2c(@xmath1,@xmath3)@xmath4o and ( @xmath1,n ) and ( @xmath1,@xmath3 ) on @xmath5ne , as discussed below . when studying details in s - process branchings , cross sections have to be determined to 1% .",
    "this is currently only possible with experiments or by a combination of experiment and theory , e.g. when supplementing resonance measurements with direct capture calculations .    in this review",
    "i first present new calculations of the evolution and nucleosynthesis of massive stars , involving reaction networks of unprecedented size .",
    "a non - exhaustive selection of important nuclear reactions is then given and their importance is shown by the impact on the results . in the second part of the paper , the current standard approach to predict nuclear cross sections and reaction rates is outlined and the remaining uncertainties and challenges are illustrated by a few examples .",
    "stars above @xmath6 @xmath7 are responsible for producing most of the oxygen and heavier elements found in nature .",
    "numerous studies have been devoted to the evolution of such stars and their nucleosynthetic yields .",
    "however , our knowledge of both the input data and the physical processes affecting the evolution of these stars has improved dramatically in recent years .",
    "thus , it became worthwhile to improve on and considerably extend the previous investigations of pre and post  collapse evolution and nucleosynthesis . the first calculation to determine , self - consistently",
    ", the complete synthesis of all stable nuclides in any model for a massive star @xcite is discussed here .",
    "the calculations were performed using the stellar evolution code kepler @xcite with several modifications relative to @xcite ( mass loss due to stellar winds , improved adaptive network ) and updates ( opal95 opacity tables , neutrino loss rates ) . according to the topic of this report",
    ", the focus is on giving an outline of the updates concerning the nuclear reactions involving the strong interaction . for further details of the calculations and results the reader is referred to the full paper @xcite .    as in @xcite ,",
    "two reaction networks are used . a small network directly coupled to the stellar model calculation",
    "provides nuclear energy generation , i.e.  it is solved implicitly for each time - step in each zone .",
    "this smaller network is essentially the same as in @xcite , but with updated nuclear rates as described in the following .",
    "one of the major improvements over @xcite and other stellar models is that , for the first time , the synthesis of all nuclides of any appreciable abundance is followed simultaneously in an _ adaptive network _ of unprecedented size .",
    "using a library containing rate information for 4,679 isotopes from hydrogen to astatine , the `` adaptive '' network automatically adjusts its size to accommodate the current nuclear flows .",
    "this saves cpu time and thus allows to perform the calculations within reasonable time .",

    "however , a few reactions were chosen subjectively for discussion here .",
    "it is well known that the leading nuclear uncertainty afflicting modern studies of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis continues to be the reaction rate of @xmath2c(@xmath1,@xmath3)@xmath4o .",

    "it is not straightforward to bridge the region of thermal energies to the region of overlapping resonances where the hauser - feshbach formalism can be used .",
    "single resonances and direct reactions become important .",
    "this is also an issue for neutron - rich nuclei in the @xmath31-process path with low neutron - separation energies .    with the reaction @xmath32ni(n,@xmath3)@xmath33ni it was previously attempted to extrapolate thermal data to s - process energies of up to a few hundred kev .",

    "a calculation of the direct capture component using dwba found a considerable p - wave contribution which enhances the cross section at 30 kev  @xcite .",
    "thus , even when including the subthreshold resonance , the 30 kev value is coincidentally similar to the value in the older compilation ( fig .",

    "a recently published large - scale reaction rate library includes neutron- , proton- , and @xmath36-induced reactions on all target nuclei from ne up to bi from proton - dripline to neutron - dripline  @xcite . due to the fact that many very short - lived nuclides can be produced in astrophysical sites ,",
    "it is necessary to provide cross sections and rates for about 4600 targets and 32000 reactions .",
    "these numbers show that theory will always play a major role in providing cross sections , despite the potential of future rare isotope accelerators .",

    "ready for direct astrophysical application  as well as tables of cross sections , reaction rates , and nuclear inputs for all possible reactions with light projectiles can also be downloaded from _ http://nucastro.org/reaclib.html _ .",
    "the calculations for the above library were performed with the hauser - feshbach code non - smoker  @xcite which is especially tuned to such large - scale predictions .",
    "the theoretical determination of nuclear properties in this code is based on microscopic or macroscopic - microscopic approaches suitable for an application far off stability .",
    "as mentioned before , due to the large number of unstable nuclei to be implemented in nuclear reaction networks for astrophysics , nuclear properties needed for the calculation of reaction rates have to be predicted .",
    "necessarily , there is a trade - off with accuracy because one can not expect to predict those properties with similar accuracy as measured data .",
    "however , whenever measured properties can be used , this will , of course , lead to an improvement in the calculated rates .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible for the vast majority of reactions off the line of stability ( and sometimes not even at stability ) .",
    "occasionally , a misconception about the best models for nuclear properties seems to arise .",
    "the question is not merely one of microscopic versus phenomenological approaches , it should rather be `` _ what can we learn from the different models and how do we implement the findings in a simple way , suited for large - scale computations ? _ '' . on one hand ,",
    "first - principles microscopic models can be more satisfying from a philosophical point of view .",
    "such a model will of course be most preferrable as soon as the perfect one has been identified .",
    "unfortunately , the current state - of - art sees competition of many different microscopic approaches , each with its own advantages and drawbacks , but we are still far from a complete , unified picture .",
    "thus , one has to be careful when using the term `` microscopic '' in the sense of a general remedy .",
    "on the other hand , the problem inherent in all microscopic approches is that they are cpu expensive .",
    "although further progress regarding cpu speed and perhaps algorithmical effectiveness can be expected , this will hamper large - scale studies for some time to come .",
    "a more effective approach is to _ understand _ the important effects found in microscopic calculations or based on _ fundamental properties _ of nuclei and to derive a simple , even if phenomenological or parametrized , way to implement them in the reaction rate calculations .",
    "a good example for using microscopic ( in this case , shell model monte carlo ) calculations in this way is the treatment of the parity distribution in nuclei at low excitation energies , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ secratio ] .",
    "an example of using fundamental properties of nuclei is the approach to calculate nuclear level densities ( sec .",
    "[ seclevden ] ) .    in the non - smoker code",
    "it was tried to implement reliable predictions of nuclear properties following the above philosophy .",
    "for instance , the nucleon optical potentials are calculated in a fast microscopic model @xcite .",
    "the photon transmission coefficients are derived using a global parametrization of gdr properties @xcite , based on the hydrodynamic droplet model and including an energy - dependent gdr width @xcite .",
    "further included are width fluctuation corrections and isospin effects @xcite .",
    "the nuclear level density will be discussed in the following section .",
    "details of all nuclear properties used are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the nuclear level density is an important ingredient in the prediction of nuclear reaction rates in astrophysics .",
    "the applicability of the statistical model of nuclear reactions ( hauser - feshbach formalism ) can be derived from the average level spacing and lower limits of energy and temperature for the application to calculate cross sections and reaction rates , respectively , can be given @xcite .",
    "the current version of the non - smoker code uses a level density description based on _ fundamental properties _ of nuclei , as introduced above .",
    "the macroscopic properties can be derived from the fermi - gas formalism @xcite .",
    "obviously , these will hold as long as the nucleons can be described by a fermi - gas , regardless of whether they are close to or far from stability .",
    "pairing is usually accounted for by introducing a backshift , leading to the well - known expressions of the shifted fermi - gas @xcite : @xmath37 with @xmath38 the spin and parity dependence @xmath39 is determined by the spin cut - off parameter @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the level density is dependent on only two parameters : the level density parameter @xmath41 and the backshift @xmath42 , which determines the energy of the first excited state .",
    "the divergence for @xmath43 can be avoided by either introducing an additional term depending on the nuclear temperature @xcite or by matching it to the constant temperature formula at low energies @xcite .    within this framework ,",
    "the quality of level density predictions depends on the reliability of systematic estimates of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "all current ( microscopic ) calculations prove that the backshifted fermi - gas can account for the nuclear level density as long as @xmath44 and @xmath45 are chosen properly , e.g.  shell model monte carlo @xcite , combinatorial approaches @xcite , and recurrence relations for exact level densities @xcite .",
    "thus , while the overall shape of the energy dependence is given by the globally valid fermi - gas , the microscopic corrections enter via @xmath45 and mainly via @xmath44 : @xmath46 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 therefore , the parameter @xmath44 contains all effects _ beyond _ a spherical droplet . here , the microscopic correction @xmath49 is thermally damped away at high excitation energies as suggested by @xcite after inspection of hydrodynamic models .",
    "three free parameters @xmath1 , @xmath50 , @xmath3 have to be fitted to nuclear data .",
    "the strength of the above approach lies in the fact that these _ microscopic properties _ can easily be extracted from other ( microscopic or semi - microscopic ) calculations which are available across the whole nuclear chart : nuclear mass models .",
    "many different inputs can easily be implemented and compared .",
    "this is explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "obviously , the resulting level density inherits the deficiencies of the underlying model concerning the microscopic properties .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : levden1 ] for two cases .",
    "nevertheless , for the majority of nuclei deviations of less than a factor of two can be obtained when using , for instance the frdm input @xcite , which translates into a much lower uncertainty ( about 30% ) in the reaction rates .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the accuracy of this purely theoretical approach is still unsurpassed , despite recent attempts for improvement with other approaches , e.g.  @xcite ( it should be noted that the average deviation quoted in @xcite includes results which were renormalized to experiment and therefore is not a measure of predictive power ) .    ratio of predicted to experimental level densities at the neutron separation energy with microscopic inputs taken from @xcite ( left ) and from @xcite ( right ) .",

    "so far , all theoretical , global calculations of astrophysical rates assume an equal distribution of the state parities at all energies .",
    "it is obvious that this assumption is not valid at low excitation energies of a nucleus .",
    "however , a globally applicable recipe was lacking .",
    "we combine a formula for the energy - dependent parity distribution @xcite with the microscopic - macroscopic nuclear level density described above @xcite .",

    "obviously , potentials fitted to single reactions can describe those  but only those  even better",
    ".    results for four different reactions using the new energy - independent potential from @xcite ( see text ) .",
    "the dashed lines are the statistical model calculation .",
    "note that the @xmath79sm(n,@xmath57 ) result is renormalized by a factor 1/1.4.,width=491 ]    closer examination of fig .",
    "[ figcarla3 ] seems to suggest that an additional energy - dependence has to be introduced at very low @xmath36-energies .",
    "this can be seen mainly from the @xmath10sm(@xmath1,@xmath3 ) comparison . however , since so far comparisons to other reactions were successful and the potentials only failed for this one case , it could also be that this is just a peculiar reaction .",
    "one peculiarity is the @xmath1-decay of the final nucleus @xmath87gd .",
    "in fact , in the considered reactions , also @xmath10nd is an @xmath1-emitter . as can also be seen from figs.[figcarla1][figcarla3 ]",
    ", the description of @xmath88sm(@xmath1,n)@xmath10nd is always less good than of those reactions without @xmath1-unstable final nucleus .",
    "this is supported by the fact that non - statistical effects have been found in this reaction @xcite .",
    "it seems that an additional effect has to be included for @xmath1-unstable nuclides , either by a modified phenomenological potential or by explicitly accounting for the correction . in the case of @xmath10sm(@xmath1,@xmath3 ) , the effect seems to start acting at around 12 mev , perhaps similar to an additional barrier .",
    "stellar models have now reached a stage where the often quoted astrophysical accuracy of `` a factor of two '' is not sufficient anymore in many cases .",
    "this poses a special challenge for the experimentalist as well as the theoretician .",
    "global nuclear models have already been quite successful in predicting nuclear rates , especially for neutron- and proton - induced reactions . despite these considerable successes close to and far off stability",
    ", the description of certain nuclear inputs , such as optical @xmath36-potentials , still needs to be improved .",
    "it is also still unclear whether nuclear properties far off stability can be predicted with sufficiently high accuracy .",
    "although future advances in microscopic theories may alleviate that problem , experimental data is clearly needed .",
    "rare isotope accelerators will make it possible to study highly unstable nuclides but also `` classical '' nuclear physics experiments with stable or long - lived nuclei are indispensable .",
    "they are not only required to study specific crucial reactions in stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis but can also provide the systematics for global descriptions and shed light on the interaction of different reaction mechanisms .",
