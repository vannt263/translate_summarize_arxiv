    "<S> the high transition temperature and low surface resistance of mgb@xmath0 attracts interest in its potential application in superconducting radio frequency ( srf ) accelerating cavities . </S>",
    "<S> however , compared to traditional nb cavities , the viability of mgb@xmath0 at high rf fields is still open to question . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to study the nonlinear electrodynamics of the material under localized rf magnetic fields . due to the presence of the small superconducting gap in the @xmath1 band , </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear response of mgb@xmath0 at low temperature is potentially complicated compared to a single gap s - wave superconductor ( sc ) such as nb . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the mechanisms of nonlinearity coming from the two - band structure of mgb@xmath2 , as well as extrinsic sources of nonlinearity , is an urgent requirement . </S>",
    "<S> a localized and strong rf magnetic field , created by a magnetic write head , is integrated into our nonlinear - meissner - effect scanning microwave microscope @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mgb@xmath2 films with thickness 50 nm , fabricated by a hybrid physical - chemical vapor deposition technique on dielectric substrates , are measured at a fixed location and show a strongly temperature - dependent third harmonic response . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that several possible mechanisms are responsible for this nonlinear response . </S>"
