    "in the last 25 years theoretical and experimental studies have established several methodologies that provide active control of the quantum dynamics of a system via manipulation of the frequency , phase and temporal character of an applied optical field @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanisms of all the methods rely on coherence and interference effects embedded in the quantum dynamics ; they vary in efficiency , generality of application , and sensitivity to perturbations .",
    "the perturbations referred to can arise from interactions between a system and its surroundings and/or from dynamical effects associated with neglected terms in a simplified hamiltonian used to characterize a system .",
    "in general , it is not possible to calculate the exact control field driving a process in an @xmath2-level system , and it is likely that if calculated that field is too complicated to be realized experimentally . for those reasons , often a control methodology is developed with respect to field - generated manipulation of population within a subset of states , without regard for the influence of the remaining background states on the quantum dynamics . in this paper",
    "we address this issue . specifically , we examine the influence of a dense manifold of background states on population transfer within a subset of embedded states , and on how that influence can be suppressed . the vehicle for our study is a particular active control protocol , namely , driving selective vibrational energy transfer in a polyatomic molecule by an assisted adiabatic process .",
    "demirplak and rice developed the counter - diabatic control protocol while studying control methods that efficiently transfer population between a selected initial state and a selected target state of an isolated molecule @xcite .",
    "the protocol has been studied for manipulation of atomic and molecular states @xcite and spin chain systems @xcite .",
    "experiments with the counter - diabatic protocol have been demonstrated for control of bose - einstein condensates @xcite and the electron spin of a single nitrogen - vacancy center in diamond @xcite .",
    "we describe how the addition of a so - called counter - diabatic field ( cdf ) to stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite fields improves the efficiency of selective vibrational energy transfer between members of an embedded subset of states of the thiophosgene ( sccl@xmath0 ) molecule and in the hcn@xmath1hnc isomerization reaction .    in a system with time - dependent hamiltonian ,",
    "an adiabatic process is one in which the populations in the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian are constant .",
    "that feature is very useful when external field generated variation of the hamiltonian is used to manipulate the system s evolution .",
    "however , an adiabatic process must be carried out very slowly , at a rate much smaller than the frequencies of transitions between states of the hamiltonian , and with a driving field intensity that does not induce transitions that compete with the desired population transfer .",
    "recognition of this restriction has led to the development of control protocols which we call assisted adiabatic transformations ; these transformations typically use an auxiliary field to produce , with overall weaker driving fields and/or in a shorter time , and without excitation of competing processes , the desired target state population . in its simplest form stirap",
    "is used to transfer population between states @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a three state manifold in which transitions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are allowed but @xmath7 is forbidden ( e.g. see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the driving optical field consists of two suitably timed and overlapping laser pulses with the ( stokes ) pulse driving the @xmath6 transition preceding the ( pump ) pulse driving the @xmath5 transition .",
    "the field dressed states of this system are combinations of the bare states @xmath3 and @xmath4 with coefficients that depend on the rabi frequencies of the pump ( @xmath8 ) and stokes ( @xmath9 ) fields .",
    "consequently , as those fields vary in time there is an adiabatic transfer of population from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "various extended stirap methods , involving more than three states , also have been proposed @xcite . in the three state system the efficiency of stirap is relatively insensitive to the details of the pulse profile and the pulse separation @xcite , but complete population transfer requires the product of the pulse overlap @xmath10 and pulse rabi frequencies be sufficiently large , @xmath11 , to suppress nonadiabatic transitions that involve @xmath12 and degrade the efficiency of the population transfer .",
    "moreover , in real situations , say vibrational energy transfer in a polyatomic molecule , the selected subset of states used for a stirap process is embedded in the complete manifold of molecular states .",
    "when the transition dipole moments between the selected states and the other states are not negligible , it is necessary to account for the influence of the background states on the efficiency of the population transfer .",
    "previous studies of stirap generated population transfer in laser - assisted hcn @xmath1 hnc isomerization @xcite have revealed that background states coupled to a subset of states used for a stirap process degrade the population transfer efficiency . and ,",
    "given that the subset of states of interest is embedded in the complete manifold of states , pulsed fields with large amplitude and/or long duration can generate unwanted processes , such as multiphoton ionization , that compete with the wanted population transfer .",
    "in this paper we report studies of state - to - state vibrational energy transfer in an isolated sccl@xmath0 molecule and in the hcn @xmath1 hnc isomerization reaction driven by stirap + cdf control . in the sccl@xmath0 study the efficiency of the controlled and selective population transfer within a subset of states embedded in a dense manifold of states is examined for both the case that the transition dipole moments between the initial and target states are much smaller than the transition dipole moments between background states and the case when they are comparable to the transition dipole moments between background states .",
    "we show that a combination of stirap and cdfs that do not individually generate competitive processes can generate greater population transfer efficiency in a subset of states that is coupled to background states than can ordinary stirap with field strength and/or pulse duration restricted to avoid excitation of competitive processes . in the hcn @xmath1 hnc isomerization reaction study",
    "we examine the case that the intermediate state of the sequential stirap process ( see section iv ) has large transition dipole moments to the background states . we show that the cdf both averts unwanted non - adiabatic population transfer due to failure of the adiabatic condition and enhances the robustness of suppression of the interference with background states .",
    "these calculations are based on the use of an approximation to the cdf , since the exact cdf is too complex to calculate .",
    "we show that the exact cdf for an isolated three level system is a useful approximation to the exact cdf for three and five state systems embedded in background states , and we report a study of the stability of the stirap + approximate cdf control protocol to variation of the cdf .",
    "the sccl@xmath0 molecule has three stretching ( @xmath13 ) and three bending ( @xmath14 ) vibrational degrees of freedom ; the energies and transition dipole moments for all levels in the manifold of vibrational states up to 21,000 @xmath15 have been reported @xcite ; see tables a1 to a3 in the appendix and [ levels_fig ] .",
    "the spectrum of states is sufficiently dense , and the distribution of dipole transition moments sufficiently irregular , that complicated dynamics arising from interference with population transfer within a subset of states from the remaining background states is to be expected .",
    "we will focus attention on the efficiency with which population transfer can be selectively directed to one of a pair of nearly degenerate states in the presence of background states .",
    "first we consider a stirap process within a subset of three states ( @xmath16 ) decoupled from the full manifold of states .",
    "hereafter we refer to these three states as @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the stirap process is intended to generate 100@xmath19 population transfer from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "we note , from [ levels_fig ] and table a1 , that @xmath22 , hereafter called @xmath23 , with energy 5658.1828 @xmath15 , is nearly degenerate with @xmath18 , with energy 5651.5617 @xmath15 . since the transition moment coupling states @xmath3 and @xmath18 is one order of magnitude smaller than those coupling states @xmath3 and @xmath23 and @xmath17 and @xmath23 selective population of @xmath18 poses a problem to be solved .    recalling that the stirap process transfers population in a system in which the initial and target states are not directly connected by a non - vanishing transition moment , using the interaction representation and the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , the hamiltonian of the three - state system with resonant pump @xmath24 and stokes @xmath25 fields can be represented in the form @xmath26 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 the rabi frequencies defined by @xmath27{0.80\\linewidth } \\begin{eqnarray } \\omega_{p}(t ) & = & \\frac{\\mu_{15^a}e_{p}^{(e)}(t)}{2\\hbar},\\nonumber\\\\ \\omega_{s}(t ) & = & \\frac{\\mu_{5^a6}e_{s}^{(e)}(t)}{2\\hbar},\\nonumber \\end{eqnarray } \\end{minipage } \\label{eq_omegas}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the envelope of the amplitude of the pump ( stokes ) field and @xmath29 the transition dipole moment between states @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "note that , by assumption , @xmath32 .",
    "the time - dependent field - dressed eigenstates of this system are linear combinations of the field - free states with coefficients that depend on the stokes and pump field magnitudes and the transition dipole moments .",
    "the field - dressed state of interest to us is @xmath33 because the stokes pulse precedes but overlaps the pump pulse , initially @xmath34 and all of the population is initially in field - free state @xmath3 . at the final time",
    "@xmath35 so all of the population in @xmath36 projects onto the target state @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath36 has no projection on the intermediate field - free state @xmath17 .",
    "suppose now that either the pulsed field duration or the field strength must be restricted to avoid exciting unwanted process that compete with the desired population transfer , with the consequence that the condition @xmath37 can not be met .",
    "this situation prompts us to seek a cdf that restores the adiabatic population transfer .",
    "the counter - diabatic hamiltonian for the stirap process can be represented as @xcite @xmath38 by inversion of the rwa the counter - diabatic field is found to be @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the energy of @xmath30 .",
    "this cdf , when added to the original stirap fields , will generate the desired @xmath42 adiabatic population transfer in the three - state system .",
    "however , as noted earlier , when there are background states coupled to the three - state subsystem , strong counter - diabatic and stirap fields can also generate processes that compete with population transfer .",
    "we now show that the combined stirap and cdfs that do not individually generate competitive processes can generate greater @xmath42 population transfer efficiency in a subset of states that is coupled to background states than can ordinary stirap with field strength and/or pulse duration that are restricted to avoid excitation of competitive processes . because the exact cdf for the full system involving the subset states embedded in the background states is very complex we use [ ecd1 ] as an approximation to the exact cdf for the system being discussed .",
    "then it is also useful to examine the stability of the driven population transfer to variation of the approximate cdf .",
    "we choose the envelopes of the amplitude of the pump and stokes fields to be @xmath43 } , \\label{eq_laser1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , and fwhm is the full width at half maximum of the gaussian pulse with maximum intensity @xmath45 that is centered at @xmath46 . using [ eq_omegas , theta1 ] @xmath47 takes the form @xmath48}}{\\tilde e_{p}^2\\mu_{p}^2\\exp\\big { [ } -\\frac{2(t - t_{p})^2}{(\\delta\\tau)^2}\\big { ] } +   \\tilde e_{s}^2\\mu_{s}^2\\exp\\big { [ } -\\frac{2(t - t_{s})^2}{(\\delta\\tau)^2}\\big { ] } } .\\nonumber \\label{thetadot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath49 from [ ecd1 ] we see that the intensity of the cdf is proportional to @xmath47 . for given @xmath45",
    "the peak intensity of the cdf is proportional to @xmath50 , because the final factor in [ dtheta ] does not affect the peak value of @xmath47 . in the numerical calculations we solved the time - dependent schr@xmath51dinger equation with a fourth order runge - kutta integrator in a basis of bare matter eigenstates with @xmath52 and the intensities and widths shown in [ table_laser1 ] .",
