    "the totem ( total cross section , elastic scattering and diffraction dissociation measurement at the lhc ) experiment has been designed to measure the total proton - proton ( pp ) cross - section , elastic scattering and diffractive processes at the lhc  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ elasticscatteringsummary ] .",
    "the experimental apparatus of totem is composed of three subdetectors : the roman pots ( rp ) , the t1 and t2 inelastic forward telescopes .",
    "the detectors are placed symmetrically on both sides of the interaction point 5 ( ip5 ) , which is shared with the cms experiment .",
    "the rps are moveable beam - pipe insertions , hosting edgeless silicon detectors to detect leading protons scattered at very small angles . in order to maximize the acceptance of the experiment for elastically scattered protons ,",
    "the rps are able to approach the beam center to a transverse distance as small as 1 mm .",
    "the alignment of the rps is optimized by reconstructing common tracks going through the overlap between the vertical and horizontal rps  @xcite .",
    "before the lhc long shutdown one ( ls1 ) the rps , used for measurements , were located at distances of 215220 m from ip5  @xcite .",
    "the actual layout , i.e. , after the lhc ls1 , is different in rp location and quantity .",
    "the rp stations previously installed at @xmath6147  m , from ip5 , have been relocated to @xmath6210  m. moreover , two newly designed horizontal rps have been installed between the two units of the @xmath7  m station  @xcite .",
    "for each tagged elastic event the four - momentum transfer squared  @xmath8 is reconstructed using the lhc optical functions , characterized with the so - called betatron amplitude at ip5  @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the totem experiment developed a novel experimental method to estimate the optical functions at the rp locations , using the measured elastically scattered protons  @xcite , see fig .",
