    "such hybrid systems show a convergence between quantum optics and nano ( micro ) -mechanical systems . in this context",
    ", a fabry - perot cavity is applied to form an approximate standing light wave while one of the mirrors at the end of the cavity is allowed to oscillate .",
    "furthermore , the novel quantum natures are discovered in this composite system by placing an atomic ensemble confined in a gas chamber inside the cavity . with the helps of the atomic ensemble",
    ", theoretical explorations have been made to show the possibilities to create not only the entanglement of the cavity field and a macroscopical object vitali , mancini , penrose , knight2 , i.e. , a mirror , but also the entanglement of atom - light - mirror @xcite . in this paper , we will consider this atom assisted optomechanical ( aaopm ) system with the strong coupling of a single atom to the photon field inside the cavity , which is modified by the moving end mirror of the cavity ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we find that a three body coupling term of photon , phonon and atom will play the crucial role in the quantum dynamics of the triple system .",
    "the triple system we will refer to contains a two - level system interacting with a single mode electromagnetic field inside the cavity with an oscillating mirror . due to the vibration of the cavity length , which is conventionally thought to induce the light pressure term mancini2,mancini , ian2,meystre2 , we illustrate that the vibrating length can also result in the triple coupling term of photon - atom - mirror . under a certain condition concerning the frequencies and the coupling strength in the so - called parametric resonance",
    ", we can exactly diagonalize the hamiltonian to obtain the eigenstates and the eigenvalues . here",
    ", the eigenstate is the direct product of the mirror s state and the state of a two body hybrid system , which consists of the photon and the atom , and can be described by the jaynes - cummings ( j - c ) model .",
    "we consider how the mirror s oscillation affects the cavity qed subsystem , by studying the quantum decoherence @xcite of this subsystem . to this end",
    ", we calculate the time evolution of the total system with the mirror initially prepared in a coherent state .",
    "we use the decoherence factor ( or the loschmidt echo ( le ) , the absolute square of the decoherence factor quan ) , to characterize the influence of the mirror s motion , which is the overlap of two wavefunctions of the mirror driven respectively by two conditional hamiltonians derived from two dressed states .",
    "we find that , though the decoherence factor depends on the initial state of the mirror , the le has nothing to do with this initial coherent state .",
    "this means the mirror s initial position only affect the decoherence factor in the form of a phase factor .",
    "the above condition for exact solution seems too special to be realized , thus we consider a more general case with the rotating - wave approximation , which only requires a set of matching frequencies rather than the coupling strength , among the atom , the cavity field and the mirror . in this case , our model is reduced to the generalized spin - orbit coupling model where the spin is referred to as the internal energy level of the atom , while the orbit is depicted by the quasi - orbital angular momentum defined by two bosonic modes ( the mirror oscillation and the single - mode photon of the cavity ) through the jordan - schwinger representation .",
    "it is well known that the quantum system with a large angular momentum @xmath0 can be regarded as a classical rotor when the angular momentum approaches infinity in the classical limit @xcite .",
    "this is because the component variations @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 become vanishingly small in comparison with the large angular momentum @xmath0 . when the angular momentum is large enough , but not infinite",
    ", the ladder operators of any large angular momentum can behave as the creation and annihilation operators of a single - mode boson @xcite .",
    "this point can be seen from the holstein - primakoff transformation straightforwardly .",
    "this case is named the quasi - classical limit and its significance in many - body physics can be understood as the low - energy excitation above the ordered ground states .",
    "this quasi - classical reduction of large angular momentum has been extensively studied and applied in quantum storage @xcite . here , we study this quasi - classical reduction by referring to the experimentally accessible parameters in triple hybrid system . in this triple system , when the frequency of the electromagnetic field almost matches the eigenfrequency of the energy level spacing of the atom plus the mirror oscillation , the photon and the mirror oscillation are coupled to form a composite object , which exactly behaves as an angular momentum .",
    "then our triple system is modeled by the generalized spin - orbit coupling similar to the hamiltonian for the paschen - back effect without the radial - dependence @xcite .",
    "this observation means that the triple coupling system will be reduced to a two - part coupling system described by the j - c model in cavity qed . at last",
    ", we show this quasi - classical reduction indeed works well when the hybrid excitation of the mirror plus photon is large enough .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we model the aaopm coupling and reduce it to the generalized spin - orbit coupling under the frequency matching condition . in sec .",
    "iii , we exactly solve the aaopm model under the parametric resonance condition and show the decoherence in sec .",

    "vi , we study the dynamics of the generalized spin - orbit coupling model to demonstrate the similarities and differences to that of the j - c model . in sec .",
    "vii , we summarize our results .",
    "in this section , we study an experimentally accessible aaopm system , as illustrated in fig .",
    "this system consists of three parts : an atom , the photons inside a cavity , and a movable end mirror .",
    "we show that such a hybrid system can be modeled by a spin - orbit coupling system , where the orbital angular momenta are realized by the phonon of the mirror dressed by the photon of the light field inside the cavity .",
    "the single mode electric field inside the cavity along the @xmath4-axis is quantized as@xmath5where @xmath6 is the position of the atomic center of mass , and @xmath7 .",
    "the frequency of the cavity field is dependent of the cavity length , @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the dielectric constant in vacuum ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the length and the volume of the cavity , respectively . here , we omit the polarization of the field , but this will not affect our final conclusion for a practical system . when the length of the cavity slightly changes from @xmath10 to @xmath12 due to the mirror s displacement @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the electric field becomes@xmath13where @xmath14    then , the total hamiltonian reads@xmath15 \\text{. } \\label{a}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath16 @xmath17 is the creation operator of the oscillating mode of the cavity field ( mirror ) ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the spin operators , which represent the transitions among the atomic inner states .",
    "@xmath21 is the atomic - position - dependent coupling strength between the cavity field and the atom , where @xmath22 is the electric - dipole transition matrix element .",
    "@xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the frequency of the mirror s oscillation and @xmath25 is the mass of the mirror , describes the light pressure , while @xmath26 denotes the coupling strength of three body  due to the vibration of the mirror . with some experimentally feasible parameters",
    ", there exists the situation where @xmath27 is on the same order of magnitude of @xmath28 , for which the strong coupling region @xcite is reached ( e.g. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then @xmath31 ) . in this case , the triple coupling term@xmath32should not be neglected . in the following discussion , we will focus on this strong coupling case .",
    "it follows from the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) that , when @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 , the j - c type interaction @xmath35 vanishes , but the three - body interaction remains .",
    "near the photon - phonon resonance case where the frequencies satisfy @xmath36 , the rotating - wave approximation reduces the hamiltonian to@xmath37 in the following discussions , we invoke the jordan - schwinger representation of the so(3 ) group @xcite@xmath38where the commutation relations of the angular momenta@xmath39 = 2l_{z},\\left [ l_{z},l_{+}\\right ] = l_{+},\\left [ l_{z},l_{-}\\right ] = -l_{-}\\]]are satisfied due to the generic commutation relations between the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bosons .",
    "then , the hamiltonian can be rewritten as@xmath42where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we remark that the three body interaction in the aaopm system can be approximately modeled with the x - y coupling@xmath46this is a kind of spin - orbit couplingreferred to as paschen - back effect @xcite .",
    "the orbital  angular momentum defined by @xmath47 and @xmath48 essentially results from the joint excitation of photon and phonon .",
    "physically , this excitation can be understood as a kind of effective mechanical oscillation of the mirror , which is dressed by the single mode photon .",
    "such kinds of dressed bosons just satisfy the angular momentum algebra .",
    "from eq . ( [ a ] ) , obviously the particle number operator @xmath49 is conserved , i.e. , @xmath50=0 $ ] . then , in the subspace @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes that the photon is prepared in a fock state @xmath53 while the atom in the ground ( excited ) state . in the following",
    "we consider the situation in which the eigen - equation of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) can be solved exactly . to this end , we first show that the hamiltonian is formally expanded as follows:@xmath54where@xmath55and@xmath56 in eq . ( [ bb ] ) , @xmath57 is the atom - photon detuning .",
    "the above argument shows that in the subspace the total system can be reduced to a spin - boson model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ aa]-[bb ] ) .",
    "now let us temporarily leave the above concrete system to consider a more general spin - boson model with the hamiltonian@xmath58where @xmath59 is a function that only depends on the boson model and @xmath60 is spin - dependent .",
    "there is a seemingly trivial proposition for this spin - boson system : if the coupling can be factorized as@xmath61with @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) depending on boson ( spin ) only , then @xmath64 can be exactly diagonalized through the diagonalizations of the two pure boson systems with branch hamiltonians@xmath65where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the eigenvalues of the c - number coefficient matrix @xmath63 in the basis @xmath68 .",
    "the proof of this proposition is rather straightforward and we only need to diagonalize @xmath69 first .",
    "next we return to the concrete example .",
    "we explore when @xmath70 can be factorized to @xmath71 , where @xmath62 is a function of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is a @xmath75-number matrix .",
    "actually when the detuning @xmath76 and the three coupling coefficients have the relation@xmath77which we call the parametric resonance , the hamiltonian indeed becomes the form of eq .",
    "( [ cc]):@xmath78where@xmath79and@xmath80    thus , to diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath81 , all we need to do is to diagonalize the matrix @xmath74 and the left quadratic part formed by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "then , the eigenvalues of @xmath82 are obtained as@xmath83for @xmath84 , where@xmath85and@xmath86here , @xmath87 @xmath88 represents the quantum number of the photons ( phonons ) .",
    "correspondingly , the eigenstates of the aaopm system are @xmath89 , where the photon dressed state@xmath90and@xmath91are defined by the mixing angle @xmath92:@xmath93while the mirror s states @xmath94 are@xmath95with the displacement operator @xmath96 .$ ]    if @xmath97 , the atom - assisted optomechanical coupling model goes back to the j - c model , and the eigenvalues , together with the eigenstates , degenerate to that of the j - c model .",
    "however , due to the vibration of the mirror , there emerge fruitful results in our model due to the complex three - body coupling .",
    "first , we examine the realization of the parametric resonance condition , ( [ b ] ) , in experiments . substituting the experimental feasible parameters into the parametric resonance condition ,",
    "we know that it is easily satisfied if the detuning @xmath76 is adjusted properly to adapt to different positions of the atom . in experiments , @xmath28 and @xmath27",
    "can reach @xmath98hz , while @xmath99 is on the order of @xmath100hz , thus @xmath76 can be on any order that lies on the atomic position . in the special case when @xmath101 , i.e. , @xmath102 , @xmath103 is sufficient to meet the condition in eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "it is observed from eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) that the terms in the second line obviously differ from the eigenvalues of the j - c model .",
    "the first term is the mirror s eigenvalue , and the second one ( without the sign ) is expanded as@xmath104where the first term @xmath105 describes the energy of the light pressure term @xmath106 knight2,knight , but the left terms are induced by the atom - assisted optomechanical coupling .",
    "in this section we demonstrate the parametric resonance will lead to a conditional dynamics with respect to two superpositions of atomic inner states @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which is described by a non - demolition hamiltonian .    from the above argument about the exact solvability of the aaopm system , we can find that the operator - valued hamiltonian matrix@xmath109\\]]is diagonalized with respect to the basis @xmath110 for the spin part .",
    "obviously this is a non - demolition hamiltonian with respect to the basis vectors @xmath111 and @xmath112and thus results in the corresponding decoherence .    driven by this non - demolition hamiltonian",
    ", the factorized initial state for the cavity qed system@xmath113will evolve into an entanglement state@xmath114where@xmath115and the extent of decoherence due to this quantum entanglement is characterized by the so - called decoherence factor@xmath116and its norm square @xmath117 is the so - called loschmidt echo @xcite .    in the context of quantum chaos , the loschmidt echo characterizes the sensitivity of evolution of quantum system in comparison with the butterfly effect in classical chaos : starting from the same initial state , the quantum system is separately driven by two slight different hamiltonians .",
    "quantum chaos is implied by the much larger differences in the two corresponding final states ; namely , their overlap ( loschmidt echo ) vanishes to illustrate the dynamical sensitivity of the quantum chaos system .",
    "next we return to the concrete system .",
    "consider the time evolution of the system when the initial state is as follows:@xmath118where @xmath119 is a coherent state of phonon that satisfies@xmath120@xmath121 , @xmath84 , is the dressed state mentioned in last section , and @xmath122 is the weight of each dressed state .",
    "therefore , at time @xmath123 the wave function of the total system is@xmath124where@xmath125    the mirror s motion will result in the collapse of the decoherence , with the loschmidt echo ( le ) being@xmath126 ,   \\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\]]where@xmath127we notice that @xmath128 does not play any role in the le .",
    "note that the mirror s initial coherent state evolves to another coherent state , and @xmath129 only determine the initial position of the center of the wavepacket @xmath130 .",
    "thus the overlap of the two wavepackets @xmath131 and @xmath132 is independent of @xmath128 .",
    "physically , this fact shows that the decoherence of the cavity - qed system is irrelevant to the phonon excitations of the mirror if its wavepacket is gaussian .    in fig .",
    "3 , for different photon - phonon excitations , we plot the time evolution of the loschmidt echo with the parameters set to @xmath133hz , @xmath134 , @xmath135 m , @xmath136 kg , @xmath137hz . from fig .",
    "3 , we see that all the curves have the same period , i.e. , @xmath138 , and the larger the difference of the photon number @xmath139 is , the larger the amplitudes of the curve are .",
    "we remark that the large photon number means a classical electromagnetic field , and thus the quantum decoherence of the atomic inner states reflects the classical transition of optical field from the quantum regime .",
    "ii , we have derived the generalized spin - orbit coupling model under the rotating - wave approximation , which can be rewritten as@xmath140here , @xmath141 and @xmath142 characterize the coupling of the angular momentum and the spin to the external field , respectively ; @xmath143 is the coupling strength of the spin - orbit .",
    "this model can be studied by exactly diagonalizing the model hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) within its invariant subspace spanned by@xmath144and@xmath145here , @xmath146 is the standard angular momentum basis , while @xmath147 and @xmath148 denote the spin - up and spin - down vectors , respectively . in this basis , the spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian in eq . ( [ g ] )",
    "is reduced to a quasi - diagonal matrix with an @xmath149 block@xmath150where @xmath151and@xmath152then it can be further diagonalized to obtain the eigenvectors@xmath153and@xmath154with the corresponding eigenvalues@xmath155where @xmath156 and @xmath157    from the spectrum structure of the aaopm system described above , we demonstrate that the triple coupling system can realize the entanglement between an orbital angular momentum and a spin .",
    "the @xmath158-component of the total angular momentum is conserved .",
    "thus , while the orbital angular momentum is flipped from down ( up ) to up ( down ) , the spin will make a reverse flip .",
    "now we can consider the quasi - classical limit of the above spin - orbit coupling model for @xmath159 large enough with low excitation .",
    "obviously , the above basis vector in this limit becomes a fock state , i.e , @xmath160 where @xmath161 @xmath162 ; while @xmath163 .",
    "correspondingly , the eigenstates become the dressed states in the usual j - c model with the eigenvalues@xmath164where @xmath165 and @xmath166    we remark that the system we considered in the limit above can also be described by the j - c model@xmath167the correspondence between the fock state @xmath168 and the standard angular momentum basis is@xmath169    actually , the above equivalence of spin - orbit coupling model and j - c interaction can be found directly by considering the holstein - primakoff mapping@xmath170 in the large @xmath159 limit .",
    "next we come back to the practical physics of the aaopm system .",
    "then the joint states @xmath171 is re - expressed in terms of the two fock states @xmath172 and @xmath173 as@xmath174here @xmath175 and @xmath176 represent the states with @xmath177 photons and @xmath178 phonons of the mirror s vibration mode respectively .    in fig . 4 and fig .",
    "5 , with different values of @xmath159 and @xmath179 , we plot @xmath180 as the functions of @xmath142 . here , we take the physical parameters as @xmath181hz , @xmath182 , @xmath183 m , @xmath136 kg , @xmath137hz .     while the dashed with the same color represents @xmath184._,width=8 ]        as shown in the figures 4 and 5 , when @xmath159 is fixed , the spectrum diagram of the aaopm system looks quite like that of the j - c model s @xcite .",
    "however , in general , its number of energy levels are much more than that in the j - c model s within the same energy range .",
    "furthermore , we can see from the several lowest levels that there exist small differences under different values of @xmath159 , such as @xmath185 vs. @xmath186 , @xmath187 vs. @xmath188 and so on .",
    "accordingly , the larger the value of @xmath159 ( the orbital angular momentum ) is , the closer the spectrum is to the corresponding ones in the j - c model . for evidence ,",
    "we have plotted the curves with a much more larger range of the variable @xmath142 that is not valid in our rotating wave approximation that requires @xmath189 .",
    "in the above sections , we have shown the similarity between the triple hybrid system and the j - c model in their energy spectra .",
    "now we continue to consider this similarity in quantum dynamics , which is referred to as the so - called quasi - classical one as we make the analysis for very large angular momentum .",
    "we consider generally the system described by the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) is initially prepared in the state represented by the density matrix @xmath190where the joint states @xmath191 denote the initial factorized structure of the triple system .",
    "according to the similarity between the generalized l - s coupling system and the triple coupling system we mentioned in the last section , the density matrix for the time evolution reads@xmath192where the branch wavefunctions@xmath193 ,   \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\]]for @xmath194 , are determined by the time dependent parameters defined by@xmath195@xmath196@xmath197@xmath198 + \\left ( \\omega _ { e}-\\delta \\right ) ^{2}}\\text{. }   \\label{i}\\ ] ]    it is noticed that the above eqs .",
    "( [ h]-[i ] ) have forms similar to that for the j - c model in the limit that @xmath199 .",
    "we remark that this limit means a low excitation of the joint system consisting of the photon and phonon , i.e. , there are only a few photons stimulated so that the joint system is almost prepared in the lowest weight state @xmath200 .",
    "the above equations give us rich information on the complex system , from which all the physically relevant quantities to the cavity field , the atom and the mirror can be obtained .  in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) is proportional to the probability that at time @xmath123 , there are @xmath203 photons , @xmath204 quanta of the mirror s vibration mode and one atom in the excited ( ground ) state .",
    "therefore the probability @xmath205 that @xmath206 photons are measured is@xmath207where @xmath208 , and @xmath209 another important quantity is the population inversion @xmath210 depending on the probability amplitudes @xmath211 and @xmath212 as@xmath213 .",
    "\\label{k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that if the initial state of the mirror is the vacuum state , i.e. , @xmath214 , then it follows from eqs . (",
    "[ j ] ) and ( [ k ] ) that @xmath215 and @xmath216 both of which are time independent no matter which state the light field is initially in .",
    "this result can be explained as follows : with the rotating - wave approximation , we only hold the slowly varying terms in the original hamiltonian to obtain effective hamiltonian ( [ l ] ) .",
    "these terms make a transition from the atom s upper level state @xmath217 to the ground state @xmath218 , together with a decrement of the quanta of the mirror s vibration mode and an increment of the photon number , or vice versa .",
    "thus when initially the mirror is in vacuum and the atom is in the excited state , the total state can not evolve to the dressed state , but only stays in the initial state companied by a dynamical phase factor .",
    "the above obtained results are very similar to that of the j - c model : @xmath219 and @xmath210 also contain many rabi oscillations with various frequencies , and in different initial states , @xmath219 and @xmath210 behave differently .",
    "next we consider that the mirror is initially in a thermal state , while the photon field is in one of several different states : a thermal state , a fock state @xmath220 and a coherent state @xmath221 .",
    "we obtain different initial parameters as follows:@xmath222@xmath223@xmath224where @xmath225 , @xmath226 is the temperature .    in fig .",
    "6 , 7 and 8 , we plot the evolution of @xmath210 in the three initial states mentioned above with the parameters @xmath227k , @xmath136 kg , @xmath183 m , @xmath228hz , @xmath229 , @xmath137hz , @xmath230 , @xmath231 .",
    "it can be seen from the figures that in each case , as time increases , collapses and revivals appear cyclically , but the time duration in which each collapse and each revival take place differs from each other because of different @xmath232 that represents the weight of the rabi oscillation with fixed frequency .",
    "this behavior of collapse and revival of inversion is repeated with increasing time , with the amplitude of rabi oscillations decreased and the time duration in which the revival takes place increased and ultimately overlapping with the earlier revival .",
    "note that the temperature is so low that @xmath233 /\\exp \\left [ \\beta \\omega _ { 0}\\left ( i+1\\right ) \\right ] \\rightarrow \\delta _ { i0}$ ] , and thus the case described in fig .",
    "6 reflects the phenomenon that the atomic transition between the upper and the lower levels can happen even when the light field is initially prepared in the vacuum state .",
    "this is obviously a purely quantum effect to prove the role of vacuum . in fig .",
    "7 we observe that even if the cavity field in a fock state , the collapse and revival appear explicitly .",
    "this case differs from the j - c model based collapse and revival phenomenon , in which the evolution of inversion is just a cosine curve when the field in a fock state .     for an initially thermal state for both the cavity field and the mirror._,width=8 ]     for an initially thermal state for mirror and a fock state @xmath234 for the field with @xmath230._,width=8 ]     for an initially thermal state for mirror and a coherent state @xmath235 for the field with @xmath236._,width=8 ]",
    "we have shown a aaopm coupling in the triple hybrid system composing of atoms , a cavity field and a movable mirror and discovered that under parametric resonance condition , this complicated model can be solved exactly .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that this triple hybrid system can be modeled by generalized l - s coupling under the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "it is shown that the composite object formed by thecavity - field - dressed mirror acts like an orbital angular momentum .",
    "then we studied the physically intrinsic relation between the generalized l - s coupling system and the j - c model , i.e. , when the orbital angular momentum is large enough , the former is quite like the latter .",
    "same to the generalized l - s coupling system , in quasi - classical limit , the ladder operators behave as the bosonic operators and thus the large angular momentum can be regarded as excitons  in the low excitation limit .",
    "we also investigated some characteristic properties of the j - c model in our triple hybrid system and discovered their similarities and differences ."
