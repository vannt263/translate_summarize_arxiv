    "the aim of this paper is to build an efficient numerical method for solving an anisotropic diffusion problem where the anisotropy is carried by a vector @xmath1 .",
    "this work is motivated by investigations of strongly magnetized plasmas , more specifically the study of the euler - lorentz model in a low mach number regime and in the presence of a large magnetic field .",
    "this framework is characteristic of the magnetically confined plasma fusion @xcite . in this context",
    ", the asymptotic parameter @xmath0 represents the gyro - period of particles as well as the square root of the mach number , the vector field @xmath1 being the magnetic field direction",
    ". therefore the @xmath0 values can be very small in some sub - regions of the computational domain where the magnetic field is large , inducing then a severe anisotropy of the medium , while being large in other sub - domains for intermediate and small strength of the magnetic field .",
    "another important property of this system is the time dependence of the magnetic field defining the anisotropy direction .",
    "these two main characteristics define the framework of the present paper whose purpose is to design a numerical scheme for anisotropy ratios ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and for a time varying anisotropy direction . in order to address efficiently these requirements ,",
    "the numerical method should not rely on a coordinate system adapted to this anisotropy direction .",
    "the use of adapted coordinates would imply mesh modifications accordingly to the evolution of @xmath1 , an intricate and expensive procedure we wish to avoid .",
    "thus , the numerical method introduced here will carry out the anisotropic non - linear diffusion problem on a mesh independent of the anisotropy direction . +",
    "this scheme will be detailed on the following model problem @xmath5 in this system , @xmath6 is a bounded subset of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is a fixed constant parameter and , for any @xmath10 , @xmath11 stands for the unit outward normal vector . @xmath12 and @xmath13 stand for the gradient and the divergence operators with respect to the space variable @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are given and the unknown of the problem is the function @xmath19 .",
    "the tensor product of two vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 is denoted @xmath22 .",
    "finally , we assume that , for any @xmath0 , the function @xmath23 is strictly increasing and can be non - linear .",
    "this equation is well suited for the plasma fusion context above depicted .",
    "it allows the computation of the plasma pressure in order to guarantee that the forces vanish in the low mach regime for strongly magnetized plasma .",
    "the function denoted @xmath24 defines the internal energy of the fluid with respect to the pressure .",
    "this relation may be non - linear , which motivates the investigation of non - linear anisotropic problems .",
    "however , the derivation of this equation is out of the scope of the present paper and we refer to related works ( see @xcite ) for detailed explanations .",
    "furthermore , we wish to present the numerical method in a context wider than the strict plasma context , since anisotropic diffusion problem are encountered in many applications .",
    "good examples of these applications are , for instance , image noise filtering , convection dominated diffusion equations and more generally diffusion problem with strong medium anisotropies .",
    "the model equation is representative of a large enough variety of problems , up to slight changes , and will be considered to detail the numerical method .",
    "developing an efficient numerical method to compute the solution of this diffusion problem , regardless to @xmath0 values , is a difficult task . indeed ,",
    "the limit @xmath2 is a singular limit for the problem ( [ elliptic_non - linear_eps_intro ] ) , the diffusion equation degenerating into the following one @xmath25 the system is ill - posed , its solution being non - unique .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath26 is a solution of ( [ elliptic_non - linear_0_intro ] ) and @xmath27 is a function verifying @xmath28 on @xmath29 , then @xmath30 defines a new solution of ( [ elliptic_non - linear_0_intro ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath31 the limit of @xmath32 solution of ( [ elliptic_non - linear_eps_intro ] ) is uniquely defined by the limit problem as demonstrated in section  [ dec ] , but a direct discretization of the diffusion problem gives rise to a linear system with a conditioning number that blows up for vanishing @xmath0 .",
    "this property has been outlined for numerical studies of elliptic equation singular perturbations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ to tackle this difficulty , an _",
    "asymptotic - preserving _ ( ap ) scheme is introduced to compute the solution of the anisotropic diffusion problem for @xmath33 and to capture @xmath31 , the solution of the limit problem , for small @xmath0 values .",
    "this property should be provided without any limitations on the discretization parameters related to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "these requirements are compliant with the properties of ap - schemes originally introduced in @xcite and developed in @xcite for diffusive regimes of transport equations .",
    "these techniques have received numerous extensions to other singular perturbation problems : relaxation limits of kinetic plasma descriptions @xcite , quasi - neutral limit of fluid and kinetic plasma models @xcite , hydrodynamic low mach number limit @xcite , radiative hydrodynamics @xcite , fluid and particle flows @xcite and strongly magnetized plasmas as well as heterogeneous media @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic - preserving property of the presented method is obtained thanks to a decomposition of the solution , introduced in @xcite and also used in @xcite .",
    "it consists of the following identity @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the solution mean part , with respect to the anisotropy ( @xmath1 ) direction , @xmath36 the fluctuating part .",
    "these two components verify @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 defining the functions constant along the @xmath1-direction , @xmath40 the functions of zero mean value along @xmath1 .",
    "this decomposition was first developed for meshes adapted to the anisotropy direction @xcite , for which , the discretization of @xmath39 is straightforward .",
    "a direct discretization of the sub - space @xmath40 is , on the other side , much more intricate .",
    "this difficulty is overcome thanks to the introduction of a lagrangian multiplier , in order to penalize the zero mean value property of the functions belonging to @xmath40 .",
    "the method is extended in @xcite for computations with meshes independent of the anisotropy direction .",
    "this is achieved by introducing two more lagrangian multipliers to discretize the sub - spaces .",
    "the size of the linear system providing the problem solution is then significantly enlarged .",
    "however , this drawback may be corrected thanks to a slightly different decomposition . in @xcite",
    "the solution is decomposed in two non - orthogonal parts which allows the definition of two sub - spaces whose direct discretization is readily obtained without any lagrangian multipliers .",
    "the size of the linear system obtained with this approach is considerably lowered compared to the previous method @xcite .",
    "this method has been extended in @xcite to non - linear diffusion equations .",
    "the path followed in the present paper still relies on the decomposition in @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , the discretization of these sub - spaces is achieved using a differential characterization , similar to the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "this finally allows the computation of the solution thanks to a second - order problem for @xmath35 and a fourth - order problem for @xmath41 .",
    "this latter problem , in the framework of neumann boundary conditions considered in this paper , can be recast into two elliptic problems .",
    "the method proposed finally reduces to the computation of three standard elliptic problems for which very efficient solvers can be used ( for instance multi - grid solvers ) . for the former approaches @xcite , the equations providing both components are not classical elliptic equations and the resolution of the linear system requires more sophisticated solvers",
    "this complexity is resource demanding and may be challenging for realistic three - dimensional computations . finally this paper also presents an extension to non - linear reaction diffusion problems , a class of problems that has never been investigated in the previous works .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the decomposition methodology is presented .",
    "the linear case , _",
    "i.e. _ with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a given function sequence , is first investigated : more precisely , we describe the decomposition procedure in the specific case where @xmath44 is a strictly positive constant denoted @xmath45 , then we generalize this procedure to any function @xmath43 by using well - chosen sobolev spaces . finally the non - linear problems are addressed by invoking gummel s iterative algorithm .",
    "section 3 is devoted to presentation of the discretization .",
    "finally , the efficiency of the numerical method is demonstrated in section 4 .",
    "in this section a scale separation is introduced to ensure the asymptotic - preserving property of the scheme .",
    "this is achieved by transforming the singular perturbation problem into an equivalent system for which the limit @xmath2 is regular . for simplicity reasons , the linear case with constant @xmath44",
    "is first considered for detailing the decomposition method . in this framework , the singular nature of the limit @xmath46 is outlined and the limit problem , providing @xmath47 , is stated . a development to linear cases with variable positive functions @xmath44 is then presented and finally , thanks to gummel s iterative method @xcite , the non - linear case is addressed by using a sequence of linear problems .",
    "we assume here that the given sequence @xmath48 is of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a known constant for any @xmath9",
    ". then the diffusion problem ( [ elliptic_non - linear_eps_intro ] ) writes @xmath51 the limit solution @xmath52 of the singular perturbation problem verifies the limit problem @xmath53 this algebraic equation admits a unique solution under the assumption @xmath54 a requirement that must be fulfilled by the numerical method . to ensure this property ,",
    "the methodology consists in using a decomposition similar to that of @xcite .",
    "the solution is decomposed into @xmath55 its mean part with respect to the anisotropy direction and @xmath36 the fluctuating part , which exhibits the property to have a zero mean value along the anisotropy direction .",
    "these two functions verify @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath39 being the kernel of the elliptic operator defined by equation  [ elliptic_non - linear_0_intro ] .",
    "these properties are capitalized on , to isolate in the problem [ elliptic_linear_eps ] the macro scale ( providing @xmath55 ) from the micro scale ( giving @xmath36 ) and thereby , build the asymptotic - preserving scheme .",
    "the main difficulty of the procedure lies in the characterization of the sub - spaces associated to the different scales . in @xcite the property of the functions populating @xmath39 or",
    "@xmath40 are imposed by a penalization technique .",
    "the methodology developed in this paper operates a similar decomposition on to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , but with a different characterization of these sub - spaces . here , we shape the technique introduced in @xcite for a very specific framework , in order to discriminate the functions in @xmath39 and @xmath40 thanks to differential properties , providing thus , an easy discretization .    with this aim , we introduce the following sobolev spaces : @xmath58 and we define @xmath59 as @xmath60 the goal is to reproduce the function decomposition into its mean and fluctuating parts .",
    "the functions of @xmath39 correspond to the mean part and the complementary part is demonstrated to belong to @xmath40 .",
    "this is the purpose of the following theorem :    [ theorem_decompo_linear ] we denote by @xmath61 the subspace of functions @xmath62 such that @xmath63 and we equip it with the usual norm on @xmath64 .",
    "then :    * @xmath65 equipped with the norm @xmath66 is a hilbert space , * @xmath61 is a closed subspace in @xmath64 , * @xmath39 is a closed subspace in @xmath64 .",
    "* we have the orthogonal decomposition @xmath67    the demonstration of this theorem will be omitted .",
    "it can be readily adapted from that of theorem 2.1 from @xcite . as a consequence of this theorem , the decomposition @xmath68 exists and is unique for any @xmath9 . therefore finding the particular solution @xmath52 which is exactly the limit of @xmath69 is equivalent to find @xmath70 and @xmath71 as the respective limits of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "then , our goal is now to find some equations for @xmath35 and @xmath41 which are well - posed for any value of @xmath0 , including @xmath74 . for this purpose ,",

    "furthermore , these observations are redundant for several values of @xmath0 : in figure [ angle_gh_variable ] , we have considered @xmath243 and @xmath244 and the obtained error curves are very close .",
    "note that other experiments have been carried out for anisotropy strengths ranging from @xmath245 to @xmath246 and with other definitions of @xmath44 and of @xmath161 , with comparable results .",
    "the curves being very similar to that of figure [ angle_gh_variable ] , these plots are omitted .",
    "these observations confirm one of the main ideas of the present paper : the accuracy of the method is almost independent of the anisotropy direction relatively to the grid , _",
    "i.e. _ the mesh over @xmath6 can be constructed whatever the anisotropy direction and strength , without a significant loss of accuracy .",

    "several tests have also been performed with other definitions of @xmath248 , for instance @xmath249 which defines an anisotropic diffusion - reaction equation similar to the steady - state allen - cahn equation ( see @xcite ) used in phase transition problems .",
    "these tests produce results almost identical to the results which are obtained when @xmath250 so we only consider the strongly non - linear reaction term defined in ( [ def_hepsgeps ] ) within the presentation of the numerical results in the next lines .",

    "since gummel s method is constructed on a linearization of the problem its convergence can not be guaranteed with a poor estimation of the solution as initial guess .",
    "it means that the parameters @xmath259 and @xmath261 can not be chosen completely arbitrarily : indeed , several simulations have been performed , all with the same parameters except @xmath261 ranging in @xmath262 and @xmath259 ranging in @xmath263 and it has been observed that gummel s method does not converge as @xmath264 when @xmath261 is larger than @xmath265 .",

    "along with the graphical representation of the solution approximation error , the evolution of the corrector norm relative to that of the solution , namely the quantity @xmath272 , is also plotted in figure [ convergence_inn_figs : corrector ] . these last results being almost identical for both meshes , the plot related to the finest mesh is omitted in this figure .",

    "the corrector term @xmath279 rapidly decreases to reach the computer precision threshold ( @xmath280 ) after 4 iterations . in the same time , the relative error also decreases but the approximation is not improved by subsequent iterations , the error remaining constant for iteration numbers greater than 4 . at this stage ,",
    "the precision of the approximation is not limited by the linearization process of the gummel s loop anymore , but by the discretization error of the linearized problem , explaining the plateau described by the error . to document this analyzis further ,",

    "this is a consequence of the second order accurate discretization of the spatial operator already outlined in section  [ sec : convergence : linear ] .",
    "finally , the results of table  [ convergence_inn_tab ] also demonstrate the independence of the numerical method precision with respect to the anisotropy intensity .      these last experiments are devoted to illustrate the asymptotic - preserving property of the numerical method , _",
    "i.e. _ its ability to compute an accurate approximation of @xmath52 , the solution of the limit problem  .",

    "this error , denoted @xmath291 and defined as @xmath292 is plotted on figure  [ convergence_ineps_nonlinear_figs : exact ] as a function of @xmath0 .",

    "two regimes can be identified .",
    "the first one is related to the largest values of @xmath0 for which a linear decrease of the error is observed .",
    "the second one is a plateau whose value depends on the mesh step @xmath203 , this value being lower for refined meshes . precisely we note a quadratic decrease of this value with the mesh size . to explain these features",

    ", the total error can be assimilated to @xmath298 and the decrease of @xmath0 is ineffective .",
    "the discrete operators being second order accurate @xmath298 is quadratically decreasing with the mesh step @xmath203 .    as a consequence",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath166 converges to @xmath52 when @xmath0 converges to 0 alongwith @xmath203 .",
    "this is exactly the asymptotic - preserving property of the scheme we intended to validate .",
    "in this paper we have presented an asymptotic - preserving numerical method for singular perturbation of non - linear anisotropic reaction - diffusion problems .",
    "the asymptotic - preserving property of the scheme is ensured thanks to a solution decomposition explained in full details in the most simple framework of a linear problem .",
    "this method is then generalized to non - linear problems thanks to gummel s linearization method .    in a second part",
    ", several two - dimensional numerical investigations of the ap - scheme are performed .",

    "the solution of the limit problem is accurately captured with no restrictions on the anisotropy strength .",
    "furthermore , the computational efficiency of the method , in terms of memory as well as cpu usage , does not depend on this anisotropy strength .",
    "several applications of the present work can be investigated : at present time , the method has been used for the resolution of linear anisotropic diffusion problems for a two - fluid euler - lorentz model ( see @xcite ) and the non - linear version of the method will be coupled to an asymptotic - preserving scheme for a one - fluid full euler - lorentz model ( see @xcite )",
