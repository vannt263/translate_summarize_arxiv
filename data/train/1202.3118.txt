    "a valence - bond solid ( vbs ) is a state of a quantum spin system in which there is no magnetic long - range order , but lattice symmetries ( translational and some times rotational ) are broken due to dimerization or , more generally , polymerization of the system into one with a larger unit cell than the underlying lattice .",
    "one can think of the spins within a unit cell of a vbs ( or within different groups of spins in a large complex unit cell ) as having an enhanced probability of forming a total spin singlet . in this paper , manifestations of vbs order in ground states of finite systems",
    "are investigated , using unbiased quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of @xmath0 spins on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice with interactions ",
    "heisenberg exchange supplemented by certain multi - spin interactions  leading to columnar order in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite the approach to the infinite - size 2d limit is investigated for different boundary conditions .",
    "the models considered can be tuned from strong to weak vbs order ( and also through a critical point ) , enabling bench - mark investigations of asymptotics and cross - over behaviors . in particular , consequences of near - criticality of the vbs order on the finite - size behavior",
    "can be examined in detail .",
    "the stability of vbs order on long cylinders ( @xmath4 lattices with @xmath16 ) is also addressed .",
    "this geometry is often used in density matrix renormalization ( dmrg ) studies,@xcite with recent intriguing results pointing to the absence of vbs order and the existence of spin liquids in frustrated models whose ground states have been debated for a long time.@xcite    in the following introductory sections , several background facts motivating further studies of vbs order are discussed and some of the known properties of vbs states are briefly reviewed .",
    "the purposes of the studies reported here will then be detailed , followed by an outline of rest of the paper .",
    "vbs states have been known for a long time to exist in 1d frustrated quantum spin chains . in particular , in the @xmath0 heisenberg chain with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the ground state at coupling ratio @xmath19 is exactly a product of singlets formed on alternating nearest - neighbor bonds ( a pattern which can be realized in two different ways ; hence the ground state is two - fold degenerate).@xcite away from this special , exactly solvable point , there are fluctuations modifying the simple product state .",
    "numerical exact diagonalization studies have shown that long - range dimerization survives down to @xmath20.@xcite for @xmath21 the ground state exhibits critical spin and vbs correlations ( like the standard heisenberg chain with @xmath22).@xcite at higher @xmath23 , the simple dimer vbs order persists at least up to @xmath24 , above which more complicated vbs or spiral spin states likely form.@xcite    the frustrated 2d square - lattice @xmath17-@xmath18 heisenberg model ( with nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath17 and the @xmath18-interactions connecting spins across the diagonals of each four - spin plaquette ) also has a non - magnetic ground state in some window of coupling ratios @xmath25 ( outside of which the ground state is nel antiferromagnetic for smaller @xmath23 and exhibits stripe antiferromagnetic order for larger @xmath23).@xcite however , in this case it has been difficult to determine the exact nature of the ground state .",
    "many studies over the past two decades have suggested a vbs , with either columnar or plaquette ( four - spin unit cell ) order,@xcite but spin liquid ground states ( which have no broken symmetries but may have topological order @xcite ) have also been proposed.@xcite very recently , results of dmrg calculations on cylindrical semi - periodic lattices ( with open edges in one direction  see fig .  [ clatt ] ) were used to argue more specifically that the ground state of the system for @xmath26 is a @xmath27 spin liquid.@xcite a concurrent calculation based on tensor - product states also claimed the absence of vbs order.@xcite     -2 mm    -2 mm    a story similar to that of the @xmath17-@xmath18 heisenberg model has played out in recent years in the case of the @xmath0 heisenberg model with only nearest - neighbor interactions on the geometrically frustrated kagome lattice .",
    "many calculations initially suggested a vbs ground state ( in this case with a complex 12- or 36-site unit cell),@xcite but the most recent dmrg studies support a @xmath27 spin liquid scenario @xcite ( as also predicted in early analytical work @xcite ) . here , as well , cylindrical lattices played a crucial role in obtaining the numerical data .",
    "when the nel order of a 2d antiferromagnet such as the @xmath0 heisenberg model is destroyed in a continuous quantum phase transition , one scenario is that the putative spin - liquid state is immediately unstable to the formation of a vbs .",
    "this has been argued to lead to a `` deconfined '' quantum - critical point separating the nel and vbs states.@xcite the phase transition is associated with deconfinement of spinons .",
    "being generically continuous , due to subtle quantum interference effectes , this type of transition violates the classical `` landau rule '' , according to which a transition between two ordered states breaking unrelated symmetries should be generically first - order .    in the low - energy field - theory argued to describe the deconfined quantum - critical point ( the 2 + 1 dimensional non - compact cp@xmath28 theory),@xcite the vbs fluctuations correspond to a u(@xmath6 ) gauge field to which spinons are coupled .",
    "there is a dangerously irrelevant operator ( a quadrupled monopole operator ) which reduces the u(@xmath6 ) symmetry to a four - fold ( @xmath29 ) symmetry inside the ordered vbs state ( in which the spinons become confined ) . on the square lattice",
    ", this corresponds to the four degenerate columnar vbs patterns .",
    "close to the critical point , the z@xmath30 symmetry only becomes apparent beyond a length - scale @xmath31 , which is larger than the standard correlation length @xmath32 associated with the magnitude of the order parameter . at distances below @xmath31",
    "there are angular fluctuations of the vbs order parameter @xmath33 , which in a system with @xmath34 order , @xmath35 , induces @xmath36 order on length scales up to @xmath31 , with this length diverging as @xmath37 with @xmath38 . at distances much below @xmath31 , the angle of",
    "the vbs order parameter fluctuates in an essentially u(@xmath6 ) isotropic manner .",
    "the deconfinement scenario appears to be realized in a class of `` @xmath1-@xmath2 '' models,@xcite in which the heisenberg exchange @xmath1 is supplemented by certain multi - spin interactions  products of two or more two - spin singlet projectors acting on different spin pairs .",
    "these interactions lead to the formation of local correlated singlets , thereby reducing , and eventually destroying , the nel order .",
    "results of qmc calculations ( which are not affected by sign problems in this case ) are consistent with a single critical point separating the nel state and a vbs .",
    "while some works suggested that the transition is weakly first - order , @xcite the most recent studies point to a continuous transition with anomalously large scaling corrections.@xcite moreover , emergent u(@xmath39 symmetry has been explicitly observed in the vbs order parameter distribution.@xcite by studying the u(@xmath6)z@xmath30 cross - over , the exponent @xmath40 was estimated in ref .   to be @xmath41 .      for the frustrated spin systems discussed above in sec .",
    "[ sec : frustvbs ] , deconfined quantum - criticality , i.e. , a gapless spin liquid existing only at a singular point , is also an alternative to the transition out of the nel state into an extended spin liquid phase . at the heart of this issue",
    "is the question of the stability of the spin liquid state.@xcite the deconfined quantum - criticality scenario implies that some spin liquids are generically unstable , at least under some commonly satisfied conditions , but stable spin liquids can also exist .    recently cano and fendley succeeded in constructing a long - sought local ( but complicated ) hamiltonian @xcite that is the parent hamiltonian of the prototypical resonating valence - bond ( rvb ) spin liquid , i.e. , the equal superposition of all nearest - neighbor valence bond configurations ( with the marshall sign rule built in).@xcite this state , however , is a u(@xmath39 spin liquid with exponentially decaying spin correlations but critical vbs correlations,@xcite and not the kind of fully gapped z@xmath15 spin liquid proposed in the context of the frustrated models discussed above [ but a u(@xmath6 ) spin liquid is also a possible ground state candidate of this model@xcite ] . as a consequence of its close relationship with the critical rokhasr - kivelson dimer model,@xcite one would expect this state to be generically unstable to perturbations of the cano - fendley hamiltonian , leading to the formation of a vbs . viewed from the perspective of a class of quantum states , the introduction of longer bonds either maintains the critical vbs,@xcite or leads to a z@xmath15 spin liquid,@xcite but the hamiltonian for these extended rvb states is not known .",
    "stable @xmath27 spin liquids are known with klein hamiltonians on particular decorated lattices,@xcite but the degree if stability of these states when moving away from the limit of high decoration is not known .",
    "the kitaev honeycomb - lattice model,@xcite which has a @xmath27 liquid state , can also be related to a model of su(@xmath42 ) interacting spins on a decorated honeycomb lattice.@xcite however , there is still no rigorously known example of a z@xmath15 spin liquid ground state of a local su(@xmath42 ) invariant hamiltonian on one of the simple standard 2d lattices ( square , triangular , honeycomb , kagome , etc ) .",
    "this lack of a prototypical system underlies the quest to find @xmath27 liquids in numerical studies of frustrated quantum spin hamiltonians.@xcite z@xmath15 spin liquid states have already been confirmed in qmc studies of frustrated quantum xy models.@xcite      it is highly non - trivial to unambiguously confirm 2d spin liquid states based on numerical calculations on relatively small lattices .",
    "the main difficulty here is to exclude weak vbs order ( while the absence of magnetic order is easier to confirm , e.g. , by demonstrating a non - zero spin gap ) .",
    "there is therefore much interest in finding positive signals for various spin liquid phases , e.g. , using unique finite - size scaling properties of the entanglement entropy.@xcite other signals related to the topological aspects of spin liquids have also been proposed.@xcite however , regardless of what properties are investigated , great care has to be taken in view of the small lattices accessible for systems with frustrated interactions .",
    "due to sign problems , unbiased qmc studies of the ground states of these systems are essentially impossible @xcite ( although some progress has been made here recently at elevated temperatures @xcite ) .",
    "variational qmc methods can be used @xcite but are not reliable , because very different states can have almost the same energy .",
    "exact diagonalization studies can reach @xmath43 spins,@xcite while dmrg calculations now can reach hundreds of spins.@xcite tensor - product state methods ( which can be regarded as generalizations of the matrix - product based @xcite dmrg scheme ) can reach much larger sizes , but are complicated by the fact that extrapolations also have to be carried out in the bond dimension of the tensors.@xcite in dmrg calculations there is a similar issue with regards to the maximum number of states that can be kept , which is what limits the accessible system sizes ( since that number of states in this case has to grow exponentially with the system size ) .",
    "as already mentioned , in dmrg studies it has become popular to use lattices in the form of cylinders with semi - periodic boundary conditions ( with periodic boundaries along the long direction and open short edges ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ clatt ] .",
    "an aspect ratio @xmath44 improves the convergence with the number of states kept , as compared to a fully periodic lattice with equal length in both directions ( for a given total number of lattices sites).@xcite the better convergence with samples of this shape can be traced to the inherently 1d nature of the dmrg procedures and how the generated states can incorporate entanglement.@xcite it has also been argued that cylindrical @xmath44 samples , some times in combination with modifications of the boundaries ( e.g. , using field terms breaking some symmetry ) , have other favorable effects as well on the convergence of various order parameters as a function of the system size.@xcite    in qmc studies of sign - problem free models , periodic @xmath3 lattices are normally used . in cases where",
    "the couplings are spatially anisotropic , it has proved helpful to use @xmath4 lattices with @xmath45,@xcite while in other cases no particular advantages of such rectangular lattices were noted.@xcite open boundaries have been considered in qmc work primarily in cases where the perturbing effects of the edges are the actual targets of investigation.@xcite in a previous qmc study of a vbs state it was also noted that open boundaries can be used to break the four - fold symmetry of the 2d vbs completely and stabilize a unique vbs pattern , as an alternative of studying vbs correlation functions in periodic lattices with no explicitly broken symmetries.@xcite      the main purpose of the present paper is to systematically investigate the role of the lattice shape and boundary conditions on the finite - size scaling properties of the vbs order parameter .",
    "vbs states have in the past few years been conclusively demonstrated in several 2d @xmath1-@xmath2 models,@xcite and also in 1d chains ( where the same kind of dimerization transition takes place as in the frustrated @xmath17-@xmath18 chain)@xcite and 3d systems.@xcite different types of vbs patterns can be realized , depending on the arrangements of the singlet projectors on the lattice .",
    "these models have been studied with large - scale qmc simulations , mainly for the purpose of investigating the nature of the nel ",
    "vbs transition.@xcite here the main focus will instead be on the vbs state itself ( including its cross - over behavior close to criticality ) , using the @xmath1-@xmath2 models to obtain generic bench - marks for finite - size scaling of this kind of order parameter .",
    "an efficient approximation - free ground state projector qmc method @xcite was used to obtain results for both strongly and weakly vbs ordered systems on square lattices with different shapes and boundaries .    in order to make contact with the currently favored manner of applying the dmrg method,@xcite cylindrical systems with open edges in one direction",
    "will be studied extensively .",

    "the limit @xmath7 will also be taken for small @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to suggesting optimal approaches for extracting the vbs order in the 2d thermodynamic limit , the results presented here will also show that the issue of excluding vbs order in a system with an unknown type of non - magnetic ground state may be more difficult than what has been anticipated so far .",
    "in particular , the geometry of long cylinders can give misleading results .",
    "not only can calculations on such systems completely miss 2d vbs order ( because the system is disordered with a short correlation length on the cylinders ) , but also the claimed positive signals of a 2d z@xmath15 spin liquid @xcite can not be trusted when used with cylinders of practically accessible widths ( because they are essentially 1d spin liquids although the state orders in the 2d limit ) .",

    "long cylinders are therefore not ideally suited for determining the nature of the 2d state in which vbs order is a possibility ( systems with a small fixed @xmath5 normally being better ) . in particular , the method of positively confirming a @xmath27 spin liquid by the absence of of order on even-@xmath8 systems is not applicable in the `` yes - no '' sense proposed in ref .  . instead",

    "the correlation length as a function of even @xmath8 should converge for a spin liquid and diverge for a vbs , as in fig .",

    "the lattice sizes reachable for such systems with unbiased calculations , primarily using the dmrg method,@xcite are still very limited .",
    "methods based on tensor - product states,@xcite beyond matrix - product states ( which are closely related to the dmrg scheme ) , are still typically too much affected by various truncation errors and approximations to be considered completely unbiased .",
    "the following discussion will therefore be primarily aimed at dmrg calculations , although many of the issues would apply more generally .",
    "the issues raised here have particular relevance in the context of a recent dmrg study of the @xmath17-@xmath18 heisenberg model on the square lattice.@xcite several different ways of analyzing vbs correlations were argued to consistently show the absence of vbs order and positively confirm the properties of a @xmath27 spin liquid .",
    "however , many of the results presented can also be explained by a vbs state , at least in some part of the non - magnetic phase , according to the results obtained here .",

    "[ peri ] and [ open ] of the present paper , even though the order parameter of this model is as large as @xmath12 of the maximum possible value .",
    "if vbs order exists also in the non - magnetic phase of the @xmath17-@xmath18 heisenberg model , one should not expect it to be very strong .",
    "therefore , the finite - size behavior seen in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "is at least qualitatively what would be expected even if the state is a vbs .",
    "it should be noted that the fact that the fitted functions extrapolate to negative values is in itself a clear sign of the chosen functional forms not being correct , as the squared order parameter can not be negative .",
    "thus , there must necessarily be a cross - over to a different form for larger systems  either to a pure @xmath222 form , if there is no long - range order , or to an exponentially rapidly convergent form tending to a non - zero value .",
    "the results for small systems can not distinguish between these different asymptotics .",
    "the finite - size extrapolation issues may clearly also affect the determination of the transition point between the nel antiferromagnet and the non - magnetic state at @xmath314 ( while the transition point into the stripe antiferromagnet at @xmath315 is much easier to extract due to it being clearly first order ) .",
    "the transition point @xmath316 was determined in ref .   based on extrapolations of the nel order parameter @xmath232 using second - order polynomials , and these should be affected by similar problems as those pointed out here for the vbs scaling ( and",
    "it is also well known that polynomials higher than second order have to be used to extrapolate nel order correctly based on small systems , even in the strongly order heisenberg model @xcite ) .",
    "the nel order should therefore survive up to somewhat larger @xmath23 values .",

    "this reflects an expected reduction of the fluctuations of the magnitude of the vbs order parameter with increasing system size .    based on these results , the cross - over length - scale @xmath31 for the @xmath53 model should be @xmath380 , which explains why both order - parameter components are essentially equal for the largest systems in fig .",

    "<S> various lattice geometries and boundary conditions are used to investigate valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) ordering in the ground state of an @xmath0 square - lattice quantum spin model  the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , in which four- or six - spin interactions @xmath2 are added to the standard heisenberg exchange @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ground state results for finite systems ( with up to thousands of spins ) are obtained using an unbiased projector quantum monte carlo method . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that great care has to be taken when extrapolating the order parameter to infinite lattice size , in particular in cylinder geometry . even though strong vbs order exists in two dimensions , and is established clearly with increasing system size on @xmath3 lattices ( or @xmath4 lattices with a fixed aspect ratio @xmath5 of order @xmath6 ) , only short - range vbs correlations are observed on long cylinders ( when @xmath7 at fixed @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation length increases with the cylinder width , until long - range order sets in at a `` critical '' width . </S>",
    "<S> this width is very large even when the 2d order is relatively strong . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for a system in which the order parameter is @xmath9 of the largest possible value , @xmath10 is required for ordering . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolations of the vbs order parameter based on correlation functions ( the square of the order parameter ) for small @xmath11 lattices can also be misleading . for a @xmath12-ordered system results for @xmath13 up to @xmath14 appear to extrapolate clearly to a vanishing order parameter , while for larger lattices the scaling behavior crosses over and extrapolates to a non - zero value ( with exponentially small finite size corrections ) . </S>",
    "<S> the vbs order parameter also exhibits interesting edge effects related the known emergent u(@xmath6 ) symmetry close to a `` deconfined '' critical point , which , if not considered properly , can lead to wrong conclusions for the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the observed finite - size behavior for small @xmath3 lattices and long cylinders is very similar to that predicted for a z@xmath15 spin liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the results therefore raise concerns about recent numerical work claiming z@xmath15 spin liquid ground states in 2d frustrated quantum spin systems , in particular , the heisenberg model with nearest and next - nearest - neighbor couplings . based on the results presented so far , a vbs state in this system </S>",
