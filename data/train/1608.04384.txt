    "we first obtained atmospheric parameters using the low resolution goodman data and the corresponding spectrophotometric standard data for flux calibration .",

    "the reliability of the standard flux calibration , we generated a comparison set of spectra which were flux calibrated with an independent set of white dwarf model spectra , kindly provided by d. koester ( see @xcite for details on model input physics and methods ) .",
    "we chose models spanning the photometrically constrained temperature range and only used continuum points for calibration to avoid biasing the fits to the balmer profiles . when fitting the model flux calibrated spectra of ec05365 we found the best fitting @xmath12 and t@xmath9 to be 8.20 @xmath7 0.05 and 22800 @xmath7 150k independent of the white dwarf model used for flux calibration .",

    "the departure of the _ w1 _ and _ w2 _ photometry from the white dwarf model of ec@xmath2005365 is evidence for an external infrared bright source .",
    "but before we can attribute it to a source coincident with ec@xmath2005365 we must consider the contribution to the _ w1 _ and _ w2 _ measurement of the nearby extra - galactic source a. since there were no photometric flags indicating profile deblending was not performed for this detection , and any contributions from source a are included in the catalog measurement .",
    "we are unable to model the expected contribution of the galaxy to _",

    "we used the galaxy sed atlas of @xcite to determine whether any nearby galaxy seds could match the observed j - ks colors and reproduce the entire _",

    "we are confident this rules out the possibility of a nearby galaxy accounting for the excess , but can not rule a higher redshift source .",
    "a by - eye extrapolation of the flux from source a in figure 3 might suggest a very strong contribution to the _ w1 _ and _ w2 _ measurements , but the spectral energy distribution does not consider all of the information available , namely the relative separations of the allwise photocenter from the measured positions of ec@xmath2005365 and source a in the vista vhs catalog . based on the additional astrometric evidence , we now argue that even if there is contamination from source a in the _ w1 _ and _ w2 _ measurements , there is still a significant infrared excess associated with ec@xmath2005365 .    _ image with _ w1 _ isoflux contours overlaid .",

    "it is immediately apparent that the contours of the _ wise _ detection are more consistent with a source detection at the position of the target ec05365 , with a minor asymmetry and offset in the direction of source a suggesting some measureable contamination . as a first - order estimate of the level of contamination",
    ", we can use the relative separations of the target and source a from the _ wise _ photocenter as a rough proxy of their relative flux . assuming the positions of the target and source a as reported by the vista science archive and considering the source position of the allwise detection and its associated error ellipse",

    "we proceed by exploring different astrophysical models that can reproduce the infrared excess associated with ec@xmath2005365 , in each case considering a minimally ( using the results from astrometry alone ) and maximally ( using the results from the forced photometry ) contaminated flux measurement for the _ w1 _ and _ w2 _ bands . for the remainder of the section we will refer to these results as case 1 and case 2 levels of contamination .",
    "the simplest model we explored was a spherical blackbody source taken to be at the photometric distance of the white dwarf , e.g. an unresolved low mass companion .",
    "a minimum chi - square fitting method was used to determine a best fitting temperature and radius for the case1 and case 2 contamination levels of 1040k , 0.15 r@xmath16 and 800k , 0.23 r@xmath16 respectively .",

    ", we can also get an estimate for the fractional infrared luminosity @xmath27 of the system .",
    "such a metric has been demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite to point towards aggregate properties of the discs of dusty white dwarfs .",
    "the different levels of contamination result in a range of @xmath28 , adding ec@xmath2005365 to the growing sample of subtle infrared excesses around young white dwarfs .",

    "we overplot the best fitted combined spectral energy distributions of the white dwarf and the dust disks on the observed photometry for case 1 and case 2 contamination in figure 5 .",
    "the range of parameters than can fit the data is large , but qualitatively the subtle excess forces the circular disk models to two classes of solutions : a wide disk observed at high inclination or a narrow disk observed at low inclination . with no prior expectation for the inclination",
    ", there is no preference for either class of solutions .",
    "the subtle excess associated with ec@xmath2005365 is so far typical of dusty white dwarfs with cooling ages below 200 myr , as recently explored by @xcite .",
    "the authors demonstrate that the assumption of disks with dust populating the entire available region between the sublimation radius where dust particles are destroyed by the stellar radiation and the tidal disruption radius where the dust is produced is inconsistent with an assumption of randomly inclined disks , given the high inclinations needed to model the subtle infrared excesses commonly observed for younger dusty white dwarfs .",
    "the tendency towards narrow disks ( which do not span the available space between the sublimation radius and tidal disruption radius ) is less apparent for older dusty white dwarfs with cooling ages between 200 and 700 myr , presenting an interesting delineation between the two samples .        as a case study",
    ", we explored whether the necessity of narrow disk width for low inclinations could be relieved for ec@xmath2005365 by modeling the infrared excess as a set of confocally nested elliptical rings rather than concentric circular rings .",
    "this was motivated by the fact that the formation scenario of dusty debris disks necessitates highly eccentric orbits during the tidal disruption phase .",
    "the eccentric rings formed by individual disruptions are expected to circularize under the effects of poynting - robertson drag on timescales ranging from tens to thousands of years for the relevant particle size scales @xcite , but the effects of multiple disruption events and collisions on the eccentricity evolution of disks is largely unknown .",
    "we begin by adopting the same passive , flat , and opaque assumptions about the dust particles as considered by @xcite .",
    "we consider the white dwarf to be at the center of our radial coordinate system , and the inner and outer ellipses that bound the disk to be described by the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 define the semi - major axes of the inner and outer ellipses , and @xmath33 defines the eccentricity of the ellipses which we hold fixed for all nested ellipses .",
    "the ellipses are confocally nested with the white dwarf at one focus .",
    "an illustration of this geometry is shown in figure 6 . in this way ,",
    "the coordinate @xmath34 specifies the distance to a dust particle from the white dwarf which uniquely determines the particle temperature under the assumption of an optically thick , flat disk .",
    "the inner / outer ellipses which bound the disk are then described by the equation : @xmath35 and our integral for the observed monochromatic flux as a function of frequency becomes : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the inclination of the disk and @xmath38 is the distance of the system .    for a qualitative comparison between circular and elliptical models , we applied both models to the case 2 contamination excess observed for ec@xmath2005365 with a fixed inner radius of the disk corresponding to a temperature of 1100k .",
    "we varied the difference between the periastron of the inner / outer ellipses and the inclination for both a circular ( @xmath39 ) and highly elliptical ( @xmath40 ) disk model to produce the constant chi - square boundaries shown in figure 7 .",
    "the 1 , 2 , and 3-@xmath24 confidence intervals correspond to the chi - squared contours of 2.30 , 6.18 , and 11.8 above the minimum chi - squared value for each grid , as appropriate for two parameters of interest .",
    "the circular and highly eccentric models have comparable minimum chi - squared values which are consistent with a reasonable fit .",
    "there is a stark difference between the acceptable parameter space for ec@xmath2005365 for circular and elliptical disks illustrated by figure 7 : for a given inclination , the elliptical disk is markedly wider at periastron .",
    "this can be intuitively understood as close - in material is re - distributed to farther distances along the eccentric orbit , effectively shifting flux from the near - infrared out to longer wavelengths .",
    "this qualitative difference holds true independent of the inner dust temperature assumed .",
    "given the lack of long wavelength data where the models begin to diverge , there is no quantitative ( e.g. goodness of fit measurement ) distinction between either model , especially considering the addition of the free parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the results are however encouraging for elliptical seds as an alternative explanation for the lack of younger disks with dust spanning the available orbital range between the sublimation and tidal disruption radius .",
    "the delineation between the dust distributions of the younger and older samples could instead be the product of a third parameter , eccentricity .",
    "we explore this possibility and the application of elliptical dusty rings to the larger dusty white dwarf sample in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we followed the procedures detailed in @xcite to estimate the atmospheric abundance of ca and mg . in short , assuming the atmospheric parameters above , we generated model white dwarf atmospheres using the codes developed by @xcite and performed a chi - squared minimization over a grid of atmospheric abundances for each element detected .",
    "we find the atmospheric metal pollution to be consistent with logarithmic abundances of [ mg / h ] = 5.36@xmath70.25 and [ ca / h ] = 5.75@xmath70.25 .",
    "figure 8 shows the best fit profile to the mg 4481@xmath20@xmath20 doublet .",
    "the observed abundances can be transformed into estimates of the accretion rate with knowledge of the rates of diffusion for each element . using the atmospheric parameters derived in section 3.1 and the updated diffusion calculations described in @xcite , we determined the diffusion timescales for ca and mg to be 2.75@xmath41 and 4.47@xmath41 years respectively .",
    "the atmospheric calculations of @xcite also include an estimate of the hydrogen mass necessary to translate the observed photospheric number densities into mass densities for the accretion rates of each species .",
    "assuming the hydrogen mass to an optical depth of @xmath42=@xmath43 is @xmath44 m@xmath16 , we find the system to be accreting ca at a rate of @xmath45 gs@xmath8 and mg at rate of @xmath46 gs@xmath8 .",
    "we did not include the effects of radiative levitation on the observed abundance and inferred accretion rate as they are are less important for lighter elements such as ca and mg , and negligible for accretion rates as high as observed @xcite .",
    "the red line is the best fit model with a logarithmic abundance of [ mg / h ] = 5.36 . ]",
    "the most exciting feature of the dusty metal polluted white dwarfs is the opportunity to translate the observed abundances into the abundances of the accreted parent body , thereby probing rocky exoplanetary abundances not accessible to other direct methods .",
    "the observed abundances depend on the rates of accretion , diffusion , and critically the understanding of the current accretion phase .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the rate of diffusion sets the relevant timescale for the accretion phase and it is reasonable to expect the atmospheric abundances have reached a steady state as long as the accretion has been held constant for > 5@xmath47 . in the case of ec05365 ,",
    "the diffusion timescales for both ca and mg are on the order of days , guaranteeing that accretion has proceeded for several times the diffusion time .",
    "therefore , we can be certain the atmospheric abundance has reached a steady state and , to within the ratios of the diffusion timescales , the observed atmospheric abundance ratios directly reflect that of the accreted parent body . including the ratio of the diffusion timescales derived above we calculate the parent abundance ratio as @xmath48/@xmath49 = + 0.24 \\pm 0.25 $ ] .    because these two elements have strong transitions in the optical ,",
    "the [ mg / ca ] ratio has been studied for a large sample of polluted white dwarfs ( see the recent assessment @xcite/@xmath49= + 0.39 $ ] for ec@xmath2005365 . ] in particular their figure 1 ) . despite some dispersion ,",
    "it is clear that the ensemble abundance ratio reflects bulk earth composition , but the abundance ratio for ec@xmath2005365 represents a large departure from mean of this sample .",
    "one possibility for this departure could be the accretion of some refractory dominated material , such as the crust of a larger , differentiated body .",
    "such a scenario is discussed by @xcite , and the spread in abundances ratios of well - studied polluted white dwarfs is further evidence for the post - nebular processing of extrasolar asteroids .",
    "the closest analog to ec@xmath2005365 is gd@xmath20362 , which @xcite demonstrated must have accreted from either multiple distinct sources , or some material that underwent post - nebular processing .",
    "a detailed abundance study will be necessary to confirm whether ec@xmath2005365 is indeed accreting from such a unique source .",
    "as the sample of dusty white dwarfs grows , it is important to consider the discovery of each system in the context of the larger dusty white dwarf sample .",
    "ec05365 is among the hottest and therefore youngest by cooling age of the dusty white dwarfs .",
    "the disk parameters are not well constrained but the fractional infrared luminosity @xmath50 = @xmath51 is quite low @xcite , adding to the sample of subtle infrared excesses around young white dwarfs .",
    "we have demonstrated for ec@xmath2005365 that the application of an elliptical ring model can help relieve the requirement that the subtle excess be modeled by either narrow or highly inclined circular dust rings , and will consider the application of elliptical rings to the larger sample of dusty white dwarfs in a forthcoming paper .",
    "though the abundance ratio of @xmath52$]/@xmath53 $ ] suggests the accreted material is not strictly bulk earth composition , for comparison with the larger sample of known accreting white dwarfs we scale the accretion rate of ca assuming bulk earth abundances and determine a total metal accretion rate of @xmath54 gs@xmath8 , consistent with similarly young systems @xcite .    .",
    "the red diamond is ec05365 .",
    "we also over plot rough magnitude limits in purple lines for objects that can have moderate to high resolution uv spectroscopy ( s / n @xmath55 20 in 2hrs with cos g130m/1291 ) and moderate resolution mid - infrared spectroscopy with _ jwst _",
    "( s / n @xmath55 10 in 10ks with miri / mrs ) . ]    detailed abundance studies of highly polluted dusty white dwarfs are the most sensitive probes of rocky exo- planetary systems .",
    "the combination of optical spectroscopy with large ground - based telescopes and ultra - violet spectroscopy with the cosmic origins spectrograph has proven effective at probing the basic atomic abundances of silicate dust that presumably participated in early terrestrial planet formation around the progenitors of these dusty white dwarfs .",
    "more broadly , hot da white dwarfs with strong mid - ir excesses are particularly valuable in validating the connection between dust abundance , dust accretion , and our understanding of white dwarf photospheric diffusion process .",
    "figure 9 presents a collection of dusty white dwarfs arranged by both _",
    "_ fuv _ magnitude and _ wise _ _ w2 _ magnitude .",
    "the rough magnitude limits for spectroscopy with cos in the _ fuv _ or miri in the mid - infrared identify 18 white dwarfs that can have detailed photospheric abundances from the uv , and will also be amenable for detailed mineralogy of the dust residing in their disks via jwst .",
    "these two measurements provide independent confirmation of the abundance of the dust in the white dwarf photosphere , and that contained in the disk , such as what has previously been done only for g29 - 38 @xcite .",
    "we identify this sample , which now includes ec@xmath2005365 , as critical for future space based follow - up studies .",
    "we would like thank the anonymous referee for their detailed reports which greatly improved this manuscript .",
    "we would also like to thank detlev koester for graciously providing his white dwarf atmospheric models .",
