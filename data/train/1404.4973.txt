    "this is one of my favorite jokes :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ three logicians walk into a bar .",
    "the waitress asks , `` do you all want beer ? ''",
    "+ the first logician answers , `` i do not know . ''",
    "+ the second logician answers , `` i do not know . ''",
    "+ the third logician answers , `` yes . ''",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this joke reminds me of hat puzzles . in the joke",
    "each logician knows whether or not s / he wants a beer , but does nt know what the others want to drink . in hat puzzles",
    "logicians know the colors of the hats on others heads , but not the color of their own hats .    here is a hat puzzle where the logicians provide the same answers as in the beer joke .",
    "three logicians wearing hats walk into a bar . they know that the hats were placed on their heads from the set of hats in figure  [ fig : hatset ] .",
    "the total number of available red hats was three , and the total number of available blue hats was two .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ fig : distinctcolors ]    it is natural to try to reuse the solution we know for the previous puzzle .",
    "let us say that the number of hats is @xmath0 and the number of logicians is @xmath1 .",
    "suppose the last person sums the colors modulo @xmath0 and announces his / her own color so that the total sum is zero .",
    "the problem is that s / he might announce the color of one of the logicians in front of him / her .",
    "suppose the last logician says `` red . '' when it s time for the logician who is actually wearing a red hat to speak , s / he will realize that his / her hat is red , and oops , s / he ca nt repeat this color . if s / he says a different color randomly , s / he will throw off the strategy and mislead everyone in front .",
    "is there a way to rescue this strategy so that only a small number of logicians might be mistaken ?",
    "it appears that there is .",
    "suppose the last logician says `` red , '' and the logician in the red hat says `` blue . ''",
    "the blue color was nt announced yet so the logician in the blue hat is most probably way in front of the red - hatted logician .",
    "that means that all the logicians between the red - hatted and the blue - hatted logicians will know that something wrong happened .",
    "they will not be misled .",
    "they will realize that the logician who said `` blue '' said so because s / he were not allowed to say his / her own color . so that color must be red .",
    "that means all the logicians in between can still figure out their colors .",
    "here is the strategy where not more than three people will name a wrong color :    the last person announces the color so that his / her color and the sum of the colors s / he sees modulo @xmath0 is zero .",
    "if there is a logician with this hat color , s / he says the hat color of the first person .",
    "this way the three people who might be mistaken are the last one , the logician with the hat color announced by the last person and the first person in line .",
    "everyone else is guaranteed to be correct .",
    "this is quite a good solution , but there is a completely different solution that guarantees that not more than * one * person is mistaken .",
    "i invite you to try and solve it yourself .",
    "if you ca nt do it , you can find the solution in my paper devoted to this puzzle @xcite .",
    "convert the above puzzles into jokes !"
