    "this argues against star  15 s membership in pal  14 . _",
    "ii ) _  star  15 is not a red giant , but more likely an evolved horizontal branch ( hb ) star or an agb star judging from its position in the cmd ( see figure  [ figcmdh ] ) .",
    "the used templates of a g7 ( hd37811 ) and a g9 ( hd45415 ) red giant may not be appropriate for star  15 .",
    "_ iii ) _",
    "star  15 could be a binary . for our faint uves sample ( stars  10 - 17 ) we have observations at two epochs : june , 2006 and march , 2007 .",
    "theoretically this allows us to measure a possible change in velocity due to binarity .",
    "the faintness and the therefore low @xmath67 of star  15 s spectra does not allow us to accurately measure the individual radial velocity for both epochs .",
    "the two measured velocities are @xmath68   and @xmath69  . within the errors the two velocities are the same .",
    "nonetheless , this does not allow us to exclude long - period binarity . _",
    "iv ) _  a further cause for the large offset of star  15 s velocity could be strong atmospheric variability , which can occur among agb stars .",
    "however , from its position in the cmd , star  15 would be an early - agb star .",
    "in this early phase , agb stars are not yet pulsating very strongly @xcite .",
    "with essentially only one observing epoch it is impossible to know about the star s variability .",
    "_ v ) _  another option might be that star  15 is not a member of pal  14 .",
    "we computed a model velocity distribution of stars which are located within the light gray curves shown in figure  [ figcmdh ] using the besanon galaxy model @xcite as described in section  [ uves ] .",
    "the expected velocity distribution , for stars with radial velocities @xmath70  , is shown in figure  [ figveldispexp ] .",
    "the number of stars in each bin is scaled to an area of @xmath17 , in order to reproduce the actually observed area .",
    "we expect about 9 stars to fulfill the photometric constraints .",
    "0.5 stars have a radial velocity between 50   and 75  .",
    "therefore , star  15 could be a foreground contaminant .",
    "in order to make predictions for the velocity dispersion in newtonian and dynamics , we first have to determine the mass of pal  14 .",
    "the measured low velocity dispersion is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction of classical newtonian dynamics , and a very strong indicator against mond .",
    "the theoretical calculations by hbk09 show the dependence of velocity dispersion and mass ( see figure  8 in hbk09 ) for classical dynamics and mond . for a given velocity dispersion",
    "the necessary mass is always smaller in mond than in classical dynamics .",
    "our derived low velocity dispersion is explainable in mond if we find a low total mass for pal  14 . to constrain the mass in pal  14 , we analyzed pal  14 s cmd and main - sequence mass function .",

    "<S> we use the distant outer halo globular cluster palomar  14 as a test case for classical vs. modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) . </S>",
    "<S> previous theoretical calculations have shown that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion predicted by these theories can differ by up to a factor of three for such sparse , remote clusters like pal  14 . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of palomar  14 by measuring radial velocities of 17 red giant cluster members obtained using the very large telescope ( vlt ) and keck telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the systemic velocity of palomar  14 is ( @xmath0 )  . </S>",
    "<S> the derived velocity dispersion of @xmath1 )   of the 16 definite member stars is in agreement with the theoretical prediction for the classical newtonian case according to @xcite . in order to exclude the possibility that a peculiar mass function might have influenced our measurements , we derived the cluster s main sequence mass function down to 0.53  @xmath2 using archival images obtained with the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we found a mass function slope of @xmath3 , which is , compared to the canonical mass function , a significantly shallower slope . </S>",
    "<S> the derived lower limit on the cluster s mass is higher than the theoretically predicted mass in case of mond . </S>",
    "<S> our data are consistent with a central density of @xmath4  . </S>",
    "<S> we need no dark matter in palomar  14 . </S>",
    "<S> if the cluster is on a circular orbit , our spectroscopic and photometric results argue against mond , unless this cluster experienced significant mass loss . </S>"
