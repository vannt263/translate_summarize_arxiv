    "since all known mesonic resonances have quantum numbers ( spin @xmath0 , parity @xmath1 , charge - conjugation parity @xmath2 , flavour / isospin ) which agree with the quantum numbers of a confined pair of a quark and an antiquark , it is reasonable to set out a description in terms of a confined two - particle system , like the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental mass spectrum of mesonic resonances does not agree with the spectrum of the ordinary ho @xcite : masses from the ho and from experiment differ substantially , while , furthermore , many ho states are not seen in experiment .",
    "recent discoveries @xcite , @xcite seem to indicate that the present experimental spectrum for mesonic resonances is still very incomplete , but masses are usually well determined .",
    "hence , the ho classification of states may work well , but it fails to reproduce the masses accurately .",
    "however , reproducing the data is not only reproducing resonance positions and possibly widths .",
    "one must also reproduce the full scattering data of experiment , even at energies where no resonances show up , and in all possible scattering channels . consequently , it is not at all clear that the ho does not work well for confinement , as long as the effects of all possible meson loops have not yet been accounted for @xcite .",
    "moreover , upon exploring the weyl - conformal - invariance property of qed / qcd , one obtains anti - desitter ( ads ) confinement @xcite with flavour - independent ho - like level spacings of spectra .",
    "the linear - plus - coulomb type of confinement is in the ads approach obtained from one - gluon exchange at short distances @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in lattice - based results , one also seems to observe a ho - like spectrum @xcite , but the common practice of fitting lattice parameters to the ground states of the spectrum leads to too large level splittings at higher energies @xcite .",
    "unquenching the confinement spectrum has been studied by various groups , and for a variety of different confinement mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the procedure usually amounts to the inclusion of meson loops in a @xmath3 description , or , equivalently , the inclusion of quark loops in a model for meson - meson scattering , resulting in resonance widths , central masses that do not coincide with the pure confinement spectrum , mass shifts of bound states , resonance line - shapes that are very different from the usual breit - wigner ones , threshold effects and cusps .",
    "in particular , it should be mentioned that mass shifts are large and negative for the ground states of the various flavour configurations @xcite .",
    "unquenching the lattice is still in its infancy , at least for the light scalars , as we conclude from ref .",
    "however , its effects should not be underestimated .",
    "hence , ground - state levels of quenched approximations for @xmath3 configurations in relative @xmath4-waves must be expected to come out far above the experimental masses .    from",
    "pure 2-body harmonic - oscillator confinement we expect to find 18 @xmath5 states in the mass region of 4.0@xmath60.2 gev , according to the quantum numbers given in table  [ ccbar4gev ] .",
    "nevertheless , we encounter only three states with established quantum numbers in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath7 at 3.77 gev , @xmath8 at 4.04 gev and @xmath9 at 4.16 gev .",
    ".@xmath5 states expected in the mass region 4.0@xmath60.2 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as early as in 1968 , p.",
    "roy @xcite , using current - algebra sum rules , estimated that a @xmath10 meson might exist , with a central mass at 725 mev and a width of @xmath11 mev .",
    "later , j.  basdevant and b.  lee @xcite determined , for various values of @xmath12 , the @xmath13 mass and width within the @xmath13 model . for @xmath14 mev",
    ", they found @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 mev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a lagrangian for vector - meson exchange was employed to determine masses 460 mev and 665 mev , and widths 675 mev and 840 mev , for the @xmath13 and the @xmath10 , respectively . in 1982 , m.  d.  scadron @xcite extended to the entire scalar nonet the dynamical spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry for the qcd quark theory , elaborated with r.  delbourgo in ref .",
    "@xcite , resulting in @xmath13(750 ) , @xmath10(800 ) , @xmath17(980 ) and @xmath18(985 ) , with respective widths of 280 mev , 80 mev , 24 mev and 58 mev .    in the meantime ,",
    "based on the phenomenology of tetraquarks ( @xmath19 ) , r.  l.  jaffe @xcite also had come to the conclusion that `` _ there should be a very broad kaon - pion enhancement at roughly 900 mev_. '' the reason for considering multi - quark configurations was based on the observation that naive confinement models , taylormade for @xmath5 and @xmath20 , produce spectra for positive - parity mesons comparable to the spectrum shown in table  [ pospar ] , with no sign of the light scalar mesons , and , furthermore , in order to explain the degeneracy of @xmath17(980 ) and @xmath18(980 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( 1986 ) , however , it was shown that the coupled - channel approach , representing quark - pair creation , is capable of describing the spectra of heavy and light quarks with one set of parameters , and that , as a bonus , the full light scalar nonet pops up without even being anticipated , with @xmath17(980 ) and @xmath18(980 ) almost degenerate , and having widths comparable to experiment ( the @xmath13 and @xmath10 results for ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ sigkap ] ) .",
    "the effects of @xmath4-wave thresholds have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    nevertheless ,",
    "many years later , the jlich group did not find a @xmath10 pole in their meson - exchange model @xcite , nor did n.  trnqvist and m.  roos @xcite , nor the @xmath21-matrix analysis of a.  anisovich and a.  sarantsev @xcite .",
    "moreover , in order to explain part of the scalar - meson nonet with the lowest - lying @xmath22 glueball , p.  minkowski and w.  ochs argued that rather a distorted nonet containing the @xmath17(1500 ) as a partner @xcite is consistent with what can be expected theoretically .",
    "the issue culminated in a paper by s.  cherry and m.  pennington @xcite , which claimed in the title `` _ there is no @xmath10(900 ) _ '' , followed by ref .",
    "@xcite , in which m.  boglione and m.  pennington even argued that the @xmath10 pole might be found on the real axis , below the @xmath23 threshold .",
    "many more works have appeared on the matter of the light scalar mesons and , in particular , on the existence and position of the @xmath10 pole .",
    "the ishidas , with k.  takamatsu and t.  tsuru , applying the method of interfering breit - wigner amplitudes to a reanalysis of the @xmath23 @xmath4-wave phase shifts , found evidence for the existence of a @xmath10(900 ) @xcite .",
    "d.  black , a.  fariborz , f.  sannino and j.  schechter , studying meson - meson scattering with the use of an effective chiral lagrangian , found a @xmath24 , together with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "but they also remarked that fitting the light scalars into a nonet pattern suggests that the underlying structure is closer to diquark - antidiquark than to quark - antiquark .",
    "m.  volkov and v.  yudichev proposed that the @xmath28(1500 ) should be composed mostly of the scalar glueball @xcite .",
    "y.  dai and y.  wu @xcite concluded , using a non - linear effective chiral lagrangian for meson fields , obtained from integrating out the quark fields by using a finite regularisation method , that the lightest nonet of scalar mesons , which appear as the chiral partners of the nonet of pseudoscalar mesons , should be composite higgs bosons with masses below the chiral - symmetry - breaking scale @xmath29 gev .",
    "h.  q.  zheng and collaborators @xcite showed that the @xmath10 resonance exists , if the scattering - length parameter in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 channel does not deviate much from its value predicted by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "t.  kunihiro _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported on very heavy @xmath10 mesons in unquenched lattice calculations .",
    "y.  oh and h.  kim @xcite proposed that the scalar @xmath32 meson may play an important role in @xmath33 photoproduction , and in particular that the parity asymmetry can separate the @xmath10-meson contribution in @xmath33 photoproduction .",
    "a breakthrough came from the @xmath34 experiment , with a clear @xmath32 signal @xcite .",
    "but the analysis of production data is far from trivial , and seems to be still under study @xcite .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite j.  oller showed that scattering data for @xmath35 and @xmath23 @xcite are in perfect agreement with the more recent production data @xcite , using the unitarised chiral perturbation method , earlier developed with e.  oset and j.  pelez @xcite .",
    "recently , also the bes collaboration found evidence for @xmath10-meson production , i.e. , in @xmath36 @xcite . in his analysis of the _ combined _ lass , e791 and",
    "bes data , d.  v.  bugg concluded that @xmath23 is fitted well with a @xmath10 pole at @xmath37 mev and the usual @xmath38(1430 ) resonance @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a scalar nonet @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath27 was obtained , using the extended three - flavour njl model , which has no quark confinement , and including 4- and 6-quark interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that one needs to include at least also 8-quark interactions in the njl model in order to obtain globally stable vacuum solutions .",
    "this has , moreover , a considerable effect on the mass of the @xmath13 resonance @xcite .",
    "finally , ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated how , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , by just varying the flavour - mass parameters ( and at the same time the related threshold masses ) , the poles of the universal @xmath4-matrix transform into one another , thus relating e.g.  @xmath10(800 ) to @xmath42 via a continuous process .",
    "in the past decade , great progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of the mesonic sector of hadronic resonances , in particular of the light - scalar nonet .",
    "the efforts in setting up and carefully analysing new experiments have greatly contributed to this achievement .",
    "nevertheless , it should be recognised that still a lot of additional data are needed and must be unravelled , in particular on resonance positions and strong - decay branching ratios , before we can hope for a more complete understanding of strong interactions .",
    "we thank the organisers of the conference for their hospitality and their efforts to bring together many specialists in a great variety of areas .",
    "it has been a very inspiring and fruitful week .",

    "<S> almost thirty years ago , penny g. estabrooks asked `` where and what are the scalar mesons ? '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first part of her question can now be confidently responded @xcite . however , with respect to the `` what '' many puzzles remain unanswered . </S>",
    "<S> scalar and axial - vector mesons form part of a large family of mesons . consequently , though it is useful to pay them some extra attention , there is no point in discussing them as isolated phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the particularity of structures in the scattering of  basically  pions and kaons with zero angular momentum is the absence of the centrifugal barrier , which allows us to ` see ' strong interactions at short distances . experimentally observed </S>",
    "<S> differences and similarities between scalar and axial - vector mesons on the one hand , and other mesons on the other hand , are very instructive for further studies . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , there exists an abundance of theoretical approaches towards the mesonic spectrum , ranging from confinement models of all kinds , i.e. , glueballs , and quark - antiquark , multiquark and hybrid configurations , to models in which only mesonic degrees of freedom are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> nature seems to come out somewhere in the middle , neither preferring pure bound states , nor effective meson - meson physics with only coupling constants and possibly form factors . as a matter of fact , apart from a few exceptions , like pions and kaons , nature does not allow us to study mesonic bound states of any kind , which is equivalent to saying that such states do not really exist . </S>",
    "<S> hence , instead of extrapolating from pions and kaons to the remainder of the meson family , it is more democratic to consider pions and kaons mesonic resonances that happen to come out below the lowest threshold for strong decay </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , confinement is an important ingredient for understanding the many regularities observed in mesonic spectra . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , excluding quark degrees of freedom is also not the most obvious way of describing mesons in general , and scalars and axial - vectors in particular . </S>"
