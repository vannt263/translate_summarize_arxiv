    "though diffusive shock acceleration has for many years been accepted as the theory of cosmic ray acceleration at shock waves , the associated cosmic ray precursor has never been convincingly detected in an astrophysical environment .",

    "no specific scenario of cosmic ray acceleration or magnetic field amplification was discussed by @xcite , though @xcite pointed out that the waves envisaged by @xcite are more efficiently excited at perpendicular shocks , and that such a geometry would naturally arise as a result of cosmic ray driven magnetic field amplification .    while magnetic field amplification is generally supported by chandra observations of thin rims in x - ray synchrotron emission delineating the blast waves of snrs , the level and mechanism of saturation remain controversial .",
    "observational estimates by various authors at cas a @xcite , sn 1006 @xcite and tycho @xcite and other snrs all summarized by @xcite generally reveal preshock magnetic fields in the range 100 - 500 @xmath15 g , far greater than the typical ambient magnetic field .",
    "such fields can be consistent with the expectations of @xcite , who suggested that the magnetic field amplifies through a nonresonant instability , driven by the cosmic ray current , which saturates at a higher magnetic field level than the resonant instability . as this",
    "nonresonant instability proceeds , cylindrical cavities oriented along the pre - existing magnetic field develop . here",

    "other authors @xcite argue that nonresonant magnetic field amplification must inevitably produce turbulence , and that the pitch angle scattering of cosmic rays in this turbulence reduces their anisotropy and velocity relative to the upstream medium , quenching the magnetic field amplification without producing any macroscopic structures upstream .",
    "features of this scenario , especially the isotropization of the cosmic rays , are reproduced in various kinetic simulations @xcite .",
    "this resonant saturation of the nonresonant instability also produces lower magnetic field than the nonresonant saturation envisaged by @xcite , and again , lower field than is generally observed .",
    "yet another alternative means of magnetic field amplification at shock waves , that of the interaction of the shock with pre - existing turbulence , is discussed by @xcite .",
    "solenoidal motions induced by this interaction generate magnetic field as it moves with the fluid . in its simplest form , this mechanism does not produce a shock precursor , and magnetic field is only amplified at the shock itself or just downstream from it , but can reach values as high as equipartition with the shocked plasma . @xcite",
    "describe another version of such a model where the precursor in a cosmic ray modified shock interacts with turbulence and amplifies magnetic field upstream . here",

    "nonresonant magnetic field amplification is essentially an mhd process .",

    "* ) have discussed a resonant means of saturating the nonresonant magnetic field growth , as the cosmic ray current is limited by pitch angle angle scattering in turbulence . in the following subsections we estimate the magnetic field amplification level and precursor distance over which this amplification occurs in both regimes of saturation .",
    "various kinetic simulations of nonresonantly amplified magnetic field @xcite suggest that cosmic ray induced magnetic field saturates not according to the @xcite scenario outlined above , but by the generation of turbulence that scatters the cosmic rays and reduces their drift relative to the upstream medium .",

    "the limits on the integral over @xmath15 become @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the particle scattering rate remains less than the gyrofrequency , even though @xmath39 , due to the presence of the factor @xmath40 in the denominator .",

    "@xcite insert a growth rate @xmath42 and derive @xmath43 in the range 10 - 100 .",
    "these values are lower than the nonresonant saturation , and so saturation by resonant diffusion , suppressing the cosmic ray flow speed with respect to the upstream medium , will occur first if allowed .",
    "the approximate expression for the growth rate above neglects the last term in the square root , and so overestimates the growth rate .",
    "this is not a very serious problem , except where the cosmic ray drift velocity is approaching the saturation value where @xmath44 .",
    "we prefer to take @xmath45 , the maximum value of the growth rate at parallel wavevector @xmath46 , which may both be rewritten with @xmath47 and @xmath31 as the upstream ion plasma and cyclotron frequencies respectively as @xmath48 and @xmath49 here , the current @xmath50 is assumed to be carried by unmagnetized cosmic rays with lorentz factors @xmath51 , as given in the appendix , with an additional flux coming from cosmic rays escaping the shock upstream at @xmath52 , given by @xcite approximately as @xmath53 .",

    "we emphasize that @xmath82 represents the cosmic ray precursor associated with magnetic field amplification , and is of course much smaller than the cosmic ray precursor associated with resonant wave generation and scattering , given approximately by @xmath83 .",
    "if the unmagnetized cosmic ray spectrum extends down to nonrelativistic energies so that @xmath84 , then this precursor is predicted to be too small to be spatially resolvable , @xmath85 cm for @xmath86 and @xmath64 .",
    "significant magnetization of cosmic rays , increasing @xmath55 , lengthens the precursor , but also reduces the eventual magnetic field so long as resonant saturation remains effective .",
    "such magnetization though is more likely in the case of nonresonant saturation discussed below , where higher magnetic fields can result .",
    "@xcite argues that cosmic ray induced magnetic field amplification should saturate as the unmagnetized cosmic rays and their associated magnetic field expel the ambient plasma from cylindrical filaments .",
    "we can examine the expected magnitude of the amplified field at saturation by considering the nonresonant instability @xcite . at saturation , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number density of unmagnetized cosmic rays with gyroradius @xmath89 .",
    "consequently , @xmath90 this represents an amplification over the initial field , assumed to be 3@xmath15 g , of a factor of 10 - 50 ( taking @xmath63 , @xmath64 @xmath91 ) , depending on the value assumed for the maximum lorentz factor of magnetized cosmic rays , @xmath55 .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude higher than magnetic field amplification limited by resonant scattering .",
    "we also calculate the magnetic precursor depth in the case that the growth is nonresonantly saturated , according to @xcite .",

    "the different dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath2 in this saturation case leads to @xmath109 , assuming @xmath55 and @xmath110 are independent of @xmath2 .",
    "this is further from the @xmath79 that produces the constant electron heating with shock velocity , and suggests that one should look at supernova remnants possibly subject to the bell magnetic field amplification to see if evidence can be found for enhanced postshock electron temperatures because the magnetic precursor length decreases less quickly with increasing shock speed .",
    "another means of nonresonant saturation is discussed by @xcite , following @xcite . the background plasma can be accelerated by the nonresonant mode , gradually shutting down the cosmic ray current with respect to it .",
    "the principal requirement for this is a cold cosmic ray `` beam '' , where the perpendicular temperature is much lower than the parallel temperature , and when the beam is cold , filamentation does not occur .",
    "argue that such a case may occur ahead of relativistic shocks , where only cosmic rays focussed along the shock velocity vector are able to outrun the shock and contribute to magnetic field amplification .",
    "the application to lower velocity snr shocks appears less clear .",
    "clearly , resonant saturation , if allowed , will restrict magnetic field amplification to only a factor of a few over the preshock ambient field",
    ". however observations of snrs generally reveal much larger magnetic field amplification that this , suggesting that resonant saturation does not occur .",
    "either nonresonant magnetic field amplification proceeds until nonresonant saturation sets in , or some other mechanism of magnetic field amplification is at work .    assuming that nonresonant field amplification is at work , what should determine whether resonant or nonresonant saturation will occur ?",
    "we argue that when the parallel wavevector of the amplification satisfies the inequality @xmath111 resonant scattering should begin to be inhibited .",
    "this is because when @xmath112 at a parallel shock , the minimum drift velocity cosmic rays need to outrun the shock and form the precursor also moves them out of resonance with parallel propagating waves . where @xmath113 is the shock obliquity , and the waves are assumed still parallel propagating .",
    "] substituting for @xmath66 from equations 4 or 6 we get @xmath2 in the range @xmath114 respectively . to satisfy the conditions discussed by @xcite , we take @xmath115 , @xmath86 , and the upper limit on @xmath32 derived from equation 6 .",
    "the equation 14 shows that resonant saturation is inhibited when @xmath116 km s@xmath117 ( dropping the explicit dependencies on other parameters ) .    in considering the competition between resonant and nonresonant magnetic field amplification ,",
    "@xcite argue for a gradual transition between the two mechanisms over an order of magnitude in shock velocity , at similar values to those in equation 14 , with resonant amplification dominating at lower shock velocities , since at saturation @xmath118 , whereas for nonresonant amplification @xmath119 .",
    "conversely , we have just shown that resonant saturation is favored over nonresonant saturation at higher shock velocities , although this depends on assumptions about the dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath2 .",
    "the arguments we have made above also tacitly assume a parallel shock geometry .",

    "we emphasize `` explicit '' angular dependence above , because @xmath134 may depend on shock obliquity through its proportionality to @xmath135 .",
    "the variation of cosmic ray pressure @xmath54 with shock obliquity is very uncertain .",
    "the threshold energy for injection into the diffusive shock acceleration process increases with increasing obliquity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , reducing the cosmic ray number density , but the acceleration rate in such geometry increases .",
    "the generation of turbulence however is much more likely to decrease with increasing obliquity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as does the cosmic ray current .",
    "these both make it likely that resonant scattering and saturation are even more inhibited in favor of nonresonant saturation in these cases of oblique shocks . simply reinstating the obliquity in equation 13 leads to @xmath2 gaining an extra factor @xmath136 in equation 14 .    in cases where cosmic ray acceleration is efficient",
    "@xcite show that amplified magnetic fields become highly disorganized , and essentially isotropic .",
    "the initial shock obliquity has little affect on the final magnetic field .",
    "this might support some of our arguments about the transition to turbulence above , but by assuming that the cosmic ray acceleration is `` efficient '' , @xcite avoid the shock injection issue .",
    "@xcite show that nonresonant saturation is still obtained at shock obliquities of 20@xmath137 , using large scale hybrid simulations , but they comment that the effect is particularly evident at parallel shocks .",
    "this implication is contrary to our speculation above .    in summary ,",
    "whether nonresonant magnetic field amplification saturates resonantly or nonresonantly depends on the value of @xmath54 and its dependence on @xmath2 , and remains unclear .",
    "much of this uncertainty can be traced to the problem of particle injection into diffusive shock acceleration , and so appears unlikely to have a simple solution .",
    "however one clear difference between these two regimes appears to be in the extent of the cosmic ray induced magnetic field shock precursor to be expected .",
    "this is something that could be possibly exploited observationally to identify the saturation mechanism and we return to discuss it further below .      following the inference of @xcite that electrons at collisionless shocks may be heated in the cosmic ray precursor , @xcite estimated the growth rate of lower hybrid waves in the cosmic ray amplified magnetic field .",
    "lower hybrid waves are electrostatic ion oscillations directed almost perpendicularly to the magnetic field in conditions where the electrons are magnetized ( electron gyroradius @xmath138 wavelength ) , inhibiting the electron screening of the oscillation that would otherwise occur .",
    "the wave phase velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field is much smaller than that along it , allowing the wave to simultaneously be in resonance with unmagnetized ions and magnetized electrons .",
    "@xcite calculated a kinetic growth rate of lower hybrid waves in a cosmic ray precursor , showing that the reactive growth for plausible cosmic ray distribution functions is zero .",
    "we correct here a small error in the final step of their calculation .",
    "we give a revised version of their equation 5 for the growth rate of lower hybrid waves in a cosmic ray precursor , where the cosmic rays are assumed to be in a `` kappa''-distribution with index @xmath139 , where @xmath140 corresponds to the @xmath141 spectrum familiar in first order fermi acceleration , @xmath142^{-\\kappa } \\frac{(p_{x}-mv_{s})}{p_{t}^{2}}{k\\over\\left|k\\right| } + \\frac{\\kappa}{\\kappa -1}\\frac{xv_{s}}{\\varkappa ^{2}}\\frac{\\partial \\varkappa } { \\partial p_{x } } \\left [ 1 + \\frac{(p_{x}-mv_{s})^{2}}{2\\kappa p_{t}^{2 } } \\right]^{1-\\kappa } \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times e^{-xv_{s}/d } dp_{x}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is modified from the original version by the factor @xmath143 multiplying the first term in curly brackets .",
    "this arises from the scalar product @xmath144 , and restricts the region of @xmath145 where the growth rate may be positive to @xmath146 .",
    "when the momentum dependence of @xmath1 is neglected , maximum growth is found at @xmath147 for @xmath140 with rate @xmath148    it is not possible in this case for lower hybrid waves to stay in contact with the shock , as in @xcite and @xcite , but in the context of an extended cosmic ray precursor ( as opposed to a narrow precursor due to shock reflected ions extending about one gyroradius upstream ) , this does not greatly affect their growth .",
    "if the second term involving @xmath149 dominates the growth rate , maximum growth is found at @xmath150 , also for @xmath140 , with rate @xmath151 where the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient @xmath152 . at a parallel shock @xmath153 for kolmogorov or kraichnan turbulence respectively , whereas @xmath154 at a perpendicular shock ( see appendix a in * ? ? ?",
    "thus the two terms are likely to contribute a similar order of magnitude to the growth rate .",
    "this is a factor of about 2 smaller than that originally given ( @xmath155 ) in the most appropriate case of a perpendicular shock .",
    "@xcite compared the growth rate for lower hybrid waves with that for magnetic field amplification , assuming that the same cosmic rays are responsible for both .",
    "they thus determine a critical alfvn mach number ( of order 10 ) where magnetic field amplification ceases and lower hybrid wave generation takes over .",
    "this argument is most appropriate for resonant saturation , where the magnetization of cosmic rays is not effective in saturating the growth .",
    "to explain other cases , the growth rate of @xcite needs to be modified to include only the unmagnetized cosmic rays .",
    "to examine the effect of electron heating , we compare the growth rates for magnetic field amplification and lower hybrid waves . at full nonresonant saturation ,",
    "the unmagnetized cosmic rays and ambient plasma do not overlap , and the growth of lower hybrid waves should be suppressed .",
    "in such a case , the treatment of @xcite may become invalid .",
    "however it is important to be aware that the inference @xmath9 is determined from snr shocks that have neutral material in their preshock media , and generally do not show strong x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "as such these are unlikely to be the strongest cosmic ray acceleration sites , and presumably have not saturated their magnetic field amplification in this manner .",
    "it is even possible that the electron heating itself prevents the magnetic field amplification from saturating .",
    "we compare the growth rate for waves that heat electrons , @xmath156 with the growth rate for magnetic field amplification , @xmath157 .",
    "we find @xmath158 the predicted amplified magnetic field is higher than that coming from nonresonant amplification saturated by resonant scattering , and so that result is unlikely to change .",
    "but in this case the magnetic field never grows to the level where lower hybrid wave growth competes with magnetic field amplification , so we do not expect significant electron heating when resonant saturation is important .",
    "however the field in equation 19 is _ lower _ than that expected from nonresonant saturation , and so the electron heating in a cosmic ray precursor might prevent the full nonlinear stage of that instability from developing , and electron heating by lower hybrid waves to take over from magnetic field amplification in dissipating the free energy of the cosmic ray current . from equation 12 , we would also expect it to reduce the depth of the magnetic field shock precursor by a similar factor , i.e. about one order of magnitude .",
    "the level of magnetic field saturation imposed by electron heating on the amplification by pre - existing turbulence is harder to assess . in the case that the magnetic field is amplified by the shock itself @xcite",
    ", the electron heating should have no effect . in the case discussed by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "corresponding to the interaction of the cosmic ray precursor with pre - shock turbulence , the growth rate is approximately given by the vorticity resulting in the preshock flow following deceleration by the cosmic ray pressure gradient .",
    "this is @xmath159 , where @xmath160 expresses the amplitude of the preshock turbulence , and @xmath161 is the length scale over which the density varies . equating this to the growth rate for lower - hybrid waves yields @xmath162 g. specializing to the forward shock of cas a , where @xmath163 cm and @xmath164 , @xmath165 g. this is much lower than the observed field of order @xmath166 g , suggesting that such instabilities are not operating .",
    "values of @xmath161 as low as @xmath5 cm would be required . as @xcite comment",
    ", the reason such instabilities may compete with the nonresonant current driven instability is that although the growth rate is intrinsically weaker , all the cosmic rays participate in the former . in the latter , only the very highest energy cosmic rays contribute .",
    "but because the growth rate is intrinsically weaker , the @xcite instability is more easily saturated by electron heating .",
    "we briefly recap . @xcite and @xcite report a dependence of electron temperature to ion temperature , @xmath8 immediately postshock approximately proportional to @xmath167 for a selection of supernova remnants exhibiting h@xmath10 emission . if @xmath168 , then @xmath169 is constant .",
    "@xcite put forward an explanation that electron heating in a cosmic ray precursor of length @xmath170 , where @xmath12 is the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient would lead to such a dependence .",
    "the time spent in the precursor by preshock gas is then @xmath171 , leading to electron heating @xmath172 independent of @xmath2 if the electron velocity diffusion coefficient , @xmath173 , in waves excited in the precursor , is proportional to @xmath174 . in the specific case of lower - hybrid waves considered by @xcite ,",
    "this is the case . in this discussion",
    ", no reference was made to the specific form of the cosmic ray precursor , but the required dependence @xmath175 suggests a bohm - like diffusion coefficient and magnetic field amplification via the resonant instability .",
    "this far , it has been the purpose of this paper to investigate how far such behavior should persist into the regime of nonresonant magnetic field amplification .",
    "@xcite invoked magnetic field amplification as a means of ensuring a locally quasi - perpendicular shock ( necessary for the generation of lower hybrid waves ) , and showed that at high alfvn mach number , magnetic field amplification has the higher growth rate , while at lower @xmath176 the cosmic ray generation of lower hybrid waves wins .",
    "they estimated a critical @xmath177 which would become @xmath178 with the correction to the lower - hybrid wave growth rate discussed above in equation 18 , where @xmath179 at a perpendicular shock is the injection velocity for diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "this is very similar to the estimate above in equation 19 . in both of these ( resonant and nonresonant ) cases , the magnetic field amplification and lower hybrid wave generation is dependent on the streaming velocity of unmagnetized cosmic rays through the upstream medium .",
    "figure 1 illustrates schematically how we envisage the electron heating to vary with shock velocity . at relatively low shock velocities , where the cosmic rays amplify magnetic field by resonant interactions ,",
    "@xmath169 is constant , according to the arguments above . at higher shock velocities , where nonresonant amplification can occur",
    ", @xmath169 can increase with shock velocity , as the precursor lengths over which magnetic field amplification can occur become larger ( equations 5 and 12 for resonant and nonresonant saturation respectively ) .",
    "the curve for resonant saturation of the nonresonant instability is shown as a dotted line , because in this case magnetic field amplification probably always dominates and quenches the electron heating .    by way of contrast",
    ", @xcite describes a calculation of instabilities excited by shock reflected ions at perpendicular shocks , which at low @xmath180 predicts @xmath169 approximately independent of shock velocity , and increasing as @xmath174 at higher @xmath176 .",
    "this arises because at low @xmath176 , the modified two stream instability grows fastest , generating lower hybrid waves , and is driven to saturation where the electron gyroradius equals the electron inertial length , @xmath181 , giving @xmath182 .",
    "thus so long as @xmath183 is constant , shocks of different velocity heat electrons to the same @xmath169 . at higher",
    "@xmath176 , the buneman instability with faster growth rate takes over , leading to the sequence of growing langmuir waves , heating electrons and then ion acoustic waves taking over , as modeled by @xcite , leading to @xmath184 .",
    "we have argued that the shock velocity dependence of the length of shock precursors due to cosmic ray magnetic field amplification means that higher electron heating should be expected at shocks where nonresonant magnetic field amplification is dominant over resonant processes . following @xcite , another possibility for electron heating at shocks undergoing nonresonant magnetic field amplification may exist , involving a drift instability of magnetized cosmic rays .",
    "as cosmic rays streaming ahead of a shock amplify magnetic field , more and more cosmic rays at the lower end of the energy spectrum become magnetized .",
    "their gyroradii in the stronger field are too small to allow them to stream ahead and contribute to the current that amplifies the field .",
    "thus , according to the inequality 15 , a shock with strong cosmic ray current that saturates resonantly may transition to nonresonant saturation ( and higher magnetic field ) if sufficient cosmic rays become magnetized to reduce @xmath185 and hence satisfy the inequality",
    ". the resonant saturation of nonresonantly generated field occurs because streaming cosmic rays are scattered and isotropized by the turbulence . in this case , no electron heating by cosmic rays should occur , because the streaming motion is inhibited .",
    "@xcite discuss an interesting exception to this rule .",
    "a drift current associated with magnetized cosmic rays may also amplify magnetic field .",
    "we argue below that it might also generate lower - hybrid waves and heat electrons .    @xcite",
    "give a theory of the perpendicular current driven instability . in the presence of cross-@xmath30 density gradients , a cosmic ray drift current may develop along the vector @xmath186 .",
    "@xcite estimate the cosmic ray drift velocity to be @xmath187 , so other instabilities besides the magnetic field amplification that they discuss could operate , including the generation of waves ( e.g. lower hybrid waves ) that could heat electrons .",
    "therefore , we briefly investigate a reactive instability driven by cosmic ray drift . in perpendicular propagation , the longitudinal part of the cold plasma dielectric tensor is @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the cosmic ray plasma and cyclotron frequencies respectively , and @xmath191 is the cosmic ray drift velocity .",
    "we have assumed @xmath192 , the electron gyrofrequency .",
    "the dispersion relation is @xmath193 where @xmath194 . as @xmath195 ,",
    "the solutions are @xmath196    reinstating the cosmic ray drift current , we find growing solutions at @xmath197 when @xmath198 . with @xmath199 , @xmath200 where @xmath201 cm",
    "s@xmath117 is the ion thermal speed in the precursor , @xmath202 , we find @xmath203 , or @xmath204 cm s@xmath117 , assuming @xmath205 .",
    "so depending on the value of @xmath33 assumed , one might expect to see a contribution to electron heating from magnetized cosmic rays start to become effective at shock velocities of order a few thousand km s@xmath117 , which should exhibit itself as a break from the @xmath9 law reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such a contribution also has to compete with magnetic field amplification by magnetized cosmic rays , which has growth rate @xcite @xmath206    the resulting electron temperature may be estimated as follows .",
    "the electron velocity will be @xmath207 since lower hybrid waves propagate within a cosine @xmath208 of the perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "if we put @xmath209 the electron kinetic energy is @xmath210 where we have put @xmath202 . for @xmath211 ,",
    "this gives electron energies of order 100 - 1000 ev , constant with shock velocity if this ratio is also constant .",
    "requiring @xmath212 for lower hybrid waves yields the following inequality @xmath213 which at @xmath214k gives @xmath215 , consistent with the forgoing .",
    "an analytic expression for the lower hybrid wave growth rate can be derived by dropping the last two terms in equation 22 , which are of order @xmath216 relative to the other through their dependence on @xmath190 , and solving the resulting cubic equation @xmath217 using standard procedures @xcite , the condition for complex roots becomes @xmath218 , in good agreement with the numerical solution above , and with predicted growth rate @xmath219 where @xmath220 .    in fig .",
    "2 we plot @xmath221 against @xmath222 as a solid line .",

    "we compare with @xmath225 plotted as dashed lines for values of @xmath226 1 , 0.3 , 0.1 , and 0.03 ( from equation 22 , in units of @xmath227 ) .",
    "as the magnetic field becomes stronger , the lower hybrid wave growth rate becomes stronger relative to the growth rate for magnetic field amplification . at sufficiently large @xmath228",
    ", magnetic field amplification always wins , but there is always a range of lower @xmath228 where lower hybrid wave growth dominates .",
    "these dashed curves take a realistic electron - proton mass ratio .",
    "@xcite present simulations with @xmath229 , and for this reason we give as dotted curves @xmath225 for the reduced mass ratio and the same values of @xmath230 .",
    "the magnetic field amplification is much stronger in such circumstances , and the `` window '' in @xmath228 where lower hybrid wave growth dominates is much reduced , consistent with @xcite who do not report any evidence of electron heating in their simulations .",
    "@xcite also report a mass ratio dependence in their treatment of electron injection by whistlers . a detailed assessment of the electron heating at saturation will require a dielectric tensor accounting for electron thermal motions in place of equation 21 , which will be deferred to a separate paper .",
    "however our simple treatment illustrates that in realistic conditions , lower hybrid wave growth may compete with magnetic field amplification and provide extra electron heating at fast efficient cosmic ray accelerating shocks .",
    "we have argued that electron heating at snr shocks should break from the behavior discovered in shocks with @xmath231 km s@xmath117 by @xcite and @xcite at sufficiently high shock velocity where nonresonant magnetic field amplification sets in .",
    "higher electron temperatures should be expected in this regime , because the shock precursor over which electron heating becomes longer than in the purely resonant case , or because magnetized cosmic rays may also contribute to electron heating through the drift instability treated in subsection 3.3 . as a first step we therefore investigate the electron heating behind the forward shocks of sn 1006 and",
    "cas a , which are faster than those studied in the samples above .",
    "the likely remnant of a type ia supernova , sn 1006 is located 500 pc above the galactic plane , expanding into unusually low density interstellar medium . having sustained high shock speeds over a long period of time , it is the most effective accelerator of cosmic rays of all known snrs .",
    "sn 1006 was the first snr from which the x - ray emission was conclusively identified as synchrotron radiation ( koyama et al .",
    "1995 , reynolds 1996 ) .",
    "this emission is strong on the ne and sw limbs .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the ne and sw synchrotron limbs represent `` polar caps '' ( willingale et al .",
    "1996 ; rothenflug et al .",
    "2004 ; reynoso et al .",
    "2013 ) , suggesting that particle acceleration ( at least of electrons ) is favored in this particular direction , which coincides with the likely direction of the galactic magnetic field ( leckband et al .",
    "thus we should tentatively conclude that particle acceleration at quasi - parallel shocks ( magnetic field aligned along shock velocity vector ) is more favored than at quasi - perpendicular .",
    "cassam - chena et al . (",
    "2008 ) find the contact discontinuity closer to the forward shock in these regions ( ne and sw ) than elsewhere in the remnant , though miceli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reach different conclusions .",
    "@xcite study knots of emission apparently ahead of the blast wave in the se region .",
    "while the regular spacing between the three knots is consistent with what one would expect from the nonlinear saturation of the bell instability , the spectra of these knots indicate that they are most likely ejecta .",
    "however in plasma with an adiabatic index of 5/3 , such knots are not expected to move anywhere close to the blast wave , let alone overtake it .",
    "@xcite suggested , following @xcite , that density perturbations ahead of the shock advected downstream induce extra vorticity that allows such knots to move ahead of the forward shock . in the case of sn 1006 ,",
    "situated high above the galactic plane , perturbations induced by a cosmic ray precursor are a plausible origin of such density structures .    a hess detection of sn 1006 has been reported @xcite , consistent with an ambient gas density of 0.05 @xmath91 @xcite .",

    "this is significantly higher than the electron heating of @xmath237 k determined at the nw limb by @xcite , supporting our hypothesis .",
    "note the this is an electron temperature immediately postshock , including any heating by adiabatic compression occurring upon shock passage , and so implies a temperature of @xmath240 k in the precursor .",
    "assuming otherwise similar cosmic ray acceleration properties at the nw and sw limbs of sn 1006 , the presence of neutrals in the nw , presumably indicative of a region of increased density in the interstellar medium which decelerates the shock , that must be making the difference .",
    "in our view , the shock has been decelerated in the nw to velocities where resonant magnetic field amplification dominates , whereas in the se , nonresonant amplification is still operating , giving rise to the increased electron heating .",
    "the direct damping of alfvn waves by charge exchange reactions is probably insignificant compared to other mechanisms of damping .",
    "cas a offers a complementary case to sn 1006 .",
    "it is a core collapse supernova remnant , which is expanding into dense remnant stellar wind .",
    "since this ambient medium was presumably photoionized by the radiation from the supernova itself , neutrals are absent from the preshock gas",
    ". the preshock magnetic field could well be considerably different to the `` canonical '' interstellar medium values of @xmath241 g .",
    "the expansion of the stellar wind from the stellar atmosphere to the position where it is now encountered by the forward shock of the supernova remnant dilutes any pre - existing magnetic field to negligible strength .",
    "any preshock magnetic field must be generated by motions within the stellar wind itself .",
    "the equipartition field for a wind moving at 20 km s@xmath117 would be 10 @xmath15 g , taking a density of 2 amu @xmath91 from @xcite .",
    "these parameters correspond to a mass loss rate of @xmath166 m@xmath242yr@xmath117 .",
    "a lower mass loss rate , or the absence of means for the magnetic field to reach equipartition would imply a ( much ) lower preshock magnetic field .    to search for and obtain measured temperatures at the forward shock , we examined thirteen regions at and interior to the outermost filaments of cas a , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "this search is complicated by two factors : the filaments are mostly dominated by synchrotron emission @xcite , and the faint outer regions of the remnant are strongly contaminated by scattering of emission from the bright ejecta ring .    as a dust scattering model is beyond the scope of our work , we chose a conservative approach in subtracting this scattered emission to identify secure examples of thermal x - ray emission associated with the forward shock .",
    "we select a local background region in the vicinity of each filament of interest , and model the spectrum in that region including a component for the particle background .",
    "the astrophysical component of the background spectrum is generally well - described by a thermal plane parallel shock model ( @xmath243 in xspec ) with variable abundances characteristic of the ejecta , and fitted temperatures and ionization ages similar to those obtained for ejecta regions by hwang & laming ( 2012 ) .",
    "this background model is then frozen and included in the spectral model for the source region of interest , with only its overall normalization freely fitted .",
    "this is a simple and conservative way to remove the effect of the scattered emission from the bright ejecta ring as this scattered emission will vary depending on the relative positions of the source and background region ( it is also energy - dependent ) . in most cases ,",
    "the background region is outside the source region , and the fitted normalization is numerically larger , though of comparable scale , to the ratio of geometrical areas on the detector .",
    "this is at least consistent with the idea that scattered intensity is higher closer to the ejecta ring , but we found that the scale factor was always fitted higher than the geometrical scale factor , regardless of the relative position of source and background . thus the thermal background emission is more likely to be oversubtracted than undersubtracted in our approach , and our identification of thermal emission associated with the forward shock should be conservative .",
    "the source spectrum itself is fitted with a variety of model , including a pure power law and vpshock models with either ejecta - type element abundances or abundances characteristic of cas a s expected circumstellar environment .",
    "we also considered models combining a power law with a forward shock type model .",
    "regions were rejected for the purpose of this study if they were better fitted with ejecta - type abundances , or a power law or if the best - fitting thermal model for the forward shock had ionization age consistent with zero within its 90% confidence errors .",
    "the actual fitted ionization ages can not be taken too seriously , as the spectral models are not likely to be very accurate at these very low ionization ages .",
    "the most that can be gleaned is that the thermal emission is present and that that ionization age is low .",
    "possibly some of the rejected regions could actually contain detectable emission from the forward shock , but this could not be confidently determined without a sophisticated and careful treatment of the scattered background .",
    "having been chosen conservatively , the two regions that remain are likely to represent instances of thermal emission associated with the forward shock .",
    "the best fitting of the models that we examined for these two regions were a combined power law and thermal forward shock model .",
    "their fitted temperatures and ionization ages are given in table 1 , with 90% confidence limits .",
    "we model cas a very similarly to the preferred model for cas a in @xcite ; 3 @xmath235 ejecta , @xmath244 ergs explosion energy , a product of blast wave radius and circumstellar density @xmath245 amu pc@xmath246 , and the radius of a circumstellar bubble @xmath247 pc .",
    "the blast wave has velocity 5000 km s@xmath117 ( at the current epoch ) and is at a radius of 2.6 pc .",
    "the preshock medium is taken to be 49% h , 49% he , and 2%",
    "n by mass , reflecting the enrichment of the outer stellar layers in n by the cno process .",
    "relative to h , he and n are enhanced over solar values by factors of approximately 2 and 20 respectively .",
    "figure 5 shows the locus of electron temperature and ionization age ( the product of electron density and time , @xmath248 ) behind the forward shock for different values of electron heating in the precursor . from the lowest to the highest , they represent no heating , and heating to temperatures of @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath249 k respectively .",
    "electrons are further heated by adiabatic compression on passage through the shock .",
    "the two points labeled `` a '' and `` b '' come from fits in @xcite , one from a synchrotron bright portion of the blast wave with higher electron temperature , and one from a synchrotron dim region with lower electron temperature . also shown on fig . 5 are points from fits to regions labeled `` s4 '' and `` sw '' , with locations within cas a shown in fig .",
    "these both have lower @xmath248 than regions `` a '' and `` b '' , and so have undergone passage through the forward shock more recently . they also broadly support the inference from the other two , that of a precursor electron temperature in the range @xmath250 k , again significantly higher than the corresponding value from an extrapolation of the survey of @xcite .",
    "considering that the preshock magnetic field may be lower , possibly considerably lower , than that in sn 1006 , the inference of postshock magnetic fields of order 100 @xmath15 g @xcite suggests that nonnresonant magnetic field amplification and saturation should be at work , if cosmic rays are responsible .",
    "unfortunately , it does not appear possible to detect such a precursor observationally , because of scattered light from the bright remnant interior .",
    "we also note that the circumstellar medium of cas a , unlike that presumed for sn 1006 , is naturally clumpy , and that in such circumstances , magnetic field amplification by the interaction of the shock with such pre - existing turbulence @xcite , or variations upon this mechanism , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can not so easily be ruled out .      in our focus on higher shock velocities than those considered by @xcite , results derived from sn 1006 and cas a , while supportive of our hypothesis , are limited by the fact that the emission we observe comes from a region downstream of the shock itself , and electron heating at the shock front is derived by model extrapolation .",
    "this is presumably because the h@xmath10 emission studied by @xcite is strongest in regions where the shock encounters denser regions of interstellar medium ; sufficiently dense that neutrals can survive against ionization , and the shock naturally decelerates in such regions .",
    "one possible example of a faster shock displaying h@xmath10 emission is snr 0509 - 67.5 @xcite . the remnant has forward shock velocities in the range 5200 - 6300 km s@xmath117 @xcite , derived from the width of the ly@xmath251 line .",
    "the h@xmath10 line profile consists of two components ; a narrow feature arising as preshock neutrals diffuse through the shock and are excited before being ionized by shocked ions and electrons , and a broad component with an origin in charge exchange , as a preshock neutral has its electron captured by a shocked proton .",
    "the intensity ratio between these two can be a diagnostic of the electron temperature .",
    "if the neutrals are primarily destroyed by electron impacts , then the broad / narrow intensity ratio will be small ( i.e. not enough slow neutrals survive long enough to become fast neutrals by charge exchange ) , but if the electrons are inefficient at ionizing neutrals , because of insignificant electron heating at the shock , the broad component becomes comparable in intensity to the narrow feature .    in snr 0509 - 67.5 ,",
    "the broad component intensity is significantly smaller than that of the narrow component , indicating the presence of electron heating .",
    "the analysis of @xcite also accounts for shock energy losses to cosmic rays , corroborating the shock speeds derived by @xcite , and finding electron / proton temperature ratios in the range 0.2 - 1 , significantly larger than those found by @xcite .",
    "while more uncertain than the sn 1006 or cas a results given above , the elevated electron temperature is determined at the forward shock itself , and further supports the argument of this paper .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to hypothesize how electron heating at collisionless shocks might behave in the absence of neutrals in the preshock medium , and in the presence of magnetic field amplification by the nonresonant cosmic ray current driven instability .",
    "compared to shocks dominated by resonant magnetic field amplification where the prescursor length @xmath252 , shocks with magnetic field amplified by the nonresonant instability have @xmath82 decreasing less quickly with increasing @xmath2 . the time spent in the precursor",
    ", @xmath253 decreases more slowly than @xmath167 , leading to an increase in the electron temperature expected if the electron heating is mediated by cosmic ray generated lower hybrid waves with velocity diffusion coefficient proportional to @xmath174 .",
    "thus at shocks of higher velocities than those in the samples of @xcite and @xcite , we speculate that the electron temperature should rise with increasing shock speed .",
    "analysis of the electron temperature behind higher speed shocks in cas a and in sn 1006 supports this view , within observational uncertainties , as do observations of balmer emission from snr 0509 - 67.5 @xcite .    at still higher shock speeds , a drift instability due to magnetized cosmic rays may also begin to heat electrons . the threshold speed where this might begin is uncertain , but of order 10,000 km s@xmath117 .",
    "observations of higher velocity shocks are obviously very interesting in this regard . of accessible supernova remnants , 1e0102 and",
    "sn 1987a would seem to be the prime candidates .",
    "@xcite infer a forward shock velocity for 1e0102 from proper motion measurements of 6000 km s@xmath117 .",
    "this forward shock , however , is running into a remnant stellar wind , which may itself have a speed of 2000 - 3000 km s@xmath117 , thus reducing the actual forward shock velocity with respect to the upstream medium .",
    "further , @xcite only infer expansion velocities of order 1000 km s@xmath117 from observations of the snr ejecta . the forward shock of sn 1987a is currently running into the inner circumstellar ring @xcite .",
    "the fast deceleration means that the shock velocity is uncertain , and the spectrum obtained necessarily has contributions from decelerated and relatively undecelerated portions of the blast wave , making precise interpretation difficult .",
    "a further complication here is that sn 1987a is relatively young , and it is unclear how much energy has yet accumulated in cosmic rays at its forward shock .",
    "this work was supported by the nasa adp program ( uh , jml and cer ) , and by basic research funds of the office of naval research ( jml and cer ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the observability , by direct and indirect means , of a shock precursor arising from magnetic field amplification by cosmic rays . </S>",

    "<S> the precursor can extend out to @xmath0 cm and is potentially detectable . </S>",
