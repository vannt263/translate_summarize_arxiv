    "binary systems containing compact objects are of great interest in a variety of areas in astrophysics . of particular importance",
    "are double white dwarf ( dwd ) binary systems where both components are white dwarfs , which may make up the largest fraction of close binary stars @xcite .",
    "following common envelope evolution , dwd binaries may emerge with a sufficiently small semi - major axis , allowing gravitational radiation to drive the stars closer together on an astrophysically interesting time scale .",
    "these close dwd systems are of prime importance as low - frequency gravitational - wave sources @xcite as well as progenitors of type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "as energy loss due to gravitational waves drives the degenerate components of a dwd binary together , it is possible for the system to enter into a stable semi - detached state , in which the less massive component will fill its roche lobe and begin transferring matter to its companion .",
    "such systems may result in the formation of am cvn @xcite , which have extremely short orbital periods . during mass transfer ,",
    "a stream of matter is pulled from the donor star through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "if the matter stream does not impact the surface of the companion star , then the mass lost from the donor is expected to settle into a disc @xcite .",
    "torques exerted between the discs and the component white dwarfs allow angular momentum stored in the disc to be transferred back to the orbit @xcite .",
    "this allows matter in the disc to fall onto the companion star while slowing the orbit contraction , increasing the potential for a stable , long - lived binary system .    for some dwd binaries , the mass transfer stream will directly impact the surface of the companion star . in doing so",
    ", there is no longer an obvious mechanism to return the orbital angular momentum from the transferred mass to the orbit .",
    "the division between the disc accretion and direct impact has been studied before ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein , hereafter paper i , marsh2004 , and gokhale2007 , respectively ) .    as in marsh2004 and gokhale2007 , we showed in paper i that mass transfer through direct impact can either increase or decrease the semi - major axis of the system , depending on the amount of angular momentum and mass exchanged between the components .",
    "if direct impact drives the system apart , both marsh2004 and gokhale2007 showed that a stabilizing accretion disc is likely to be created .",
    "if direct - impact mass transfer decreases the semi - major axis , the mass transfer rate may eventually become unstable , which can result in a merger .",
    "if the total mass of the system is in excess of the chandrasekhar limit , such merger events could lead to a type ia supernova @xcite .",
    "marsh2004 and gokhale2007 both calculated of the long term evolution of such systems .",
    "marsh2004 concluded that the population of dwd binaries is likely lower than previously anticipated as a result of the high percentage of systems undergoing direct - impact accretion that become unstable .",
    "gokhale2007 improved upon the analysis of marsh2004 by permitting the spin of the donor to vary and by including the effects of tidal forces from the donor star ( marsh2004 only examined tidal forces arising from asynchronicity between the accretor and the orbit . in their calculation , the spin of the donor was fixed to that of the orbit throughout so that no tides arose from asynchronicity between the donor and orbit . )",
    "the modifications of gokhale2007 resulted in an increase in the number of stable systems which can be seen in figures 2 and 3 in section 4 . in paper",
    "i we built upon both of these studies , providing direct ballistic integrations of the mass transfer stream ( as opposed to the previous method using an approximation adopted from @xcite ) .",
    "we showed that removing this approximation which accounts for the complex three - body dynamics of the ejected mass can have a significant impact upon the angular momentum exchange .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the results of paper i to determine the long - term evolution of double white dwarf binaries in a fully self - consisent manner . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the equations which govern the long - term evolution of dwd systems and discuss the differences between this method and the method utilized by previous studies . in section 3",
    "we discuss some details of our long - term numerical integrations . in section 4",
    "we discuss the results of our solutions and analyze the results in comparison to those of previous works .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "following paper i , we consider a close binary system of two white dwarfs with masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 , volume - equivalent radii of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and uniform rotation rates @xmath4 and @xmath5 with axes perpendicular to the orbital plane for the accretor and donor , respectively .",
    "we assume the mass of each star is distributed spherically symmetrically . as in the analyses of marsh2004 and gokhale2007",
    ", we assume the binary to remain in a circular keplarian orbit throughout its evolution .",
    "the radius of each object is assigned following eggleton s zero - temperature mass - radius relation ( equation 15 of @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that both the donor and accretor initially rotate sychronously with the orbit ( marsh2004 , gokhale2007 ) .",
    "we choose the initial semi - major axis of the orbit such that the volume - equivalent radius of the donor ( @xmath3 ) is equal to the volume - equivalent radius of its roche lobe as fit by @xcite .",
    "as described in marsh2004 and gokhale2007 , the orbital evolution of a circular binary system can be described by its orbital angular momentum .",
    "we begin by presenting each of the components that can lead to a change in the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the total angular momentum , @xmath6 , of a binary system is given by the sum of the orbital angular momentum , @xmath7 , and the spin angular momenta , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , of the accretor and donor , respectively : @xmath10    the orbital angular momentum is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath14 is the semi - major axis of the system .",
    "the spin angular momenta of the accretor and donor are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are dimensionless constants depending upon the internal structure of the accretor and donor , respectively .",
    "it follows that : @xmath19    there are three effects that change the orbital angular momentum over time : mass transfer ( mt ) , tides , and gravitational radiation ( gr ) .",
    "assuming each effect is indepedent of the others , we can then write the total change of the orbital angular momentum as the sum of the changes due to each of the above effects , with subscripts , as noted above , for each of the respective components : @xmath20 to determine the total change in the angular momentum , then , we simply need to write the change due to each of the above effects .",
    "the change in orbital angular momentum due to gr for a circular orbit is given by : @xmath21 ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "prior to the onset of mass transfer , the semi - major axis of the binary will have been shrinking due to the effects of gr as seen in equation  ( [ eq-5 ] ) . during this time",
    ", tidal coupling will act to circularize the binary as well as synchronize the spins of the stars with the orbit . at the onset of mass transfer",
    ", we assume the spins and orbit to be synchronized . as mass",
    "transfer begins , angular momentum will be exchanged between the spins of the component stars and the orbit ( see paper i ) .",
    "any resulting asynchronization between the spins and the orbit leads to tidal coupling , the strength of which will determine how much of the spin angular momentum of the accretor is returned to the orbit .",
    "this will ultimately affect the stability of the mass transfer process .",
    "as in gokhale2007 , we model the change in the binary orbital angular momentum due to tides by : @xmath22 the first term on the right - hand side of this equation represents the torque due to dissipative coupling upon the accretor , and the second term the torque upon the donor .",
    "these torques are parameterized in terms of the synchronization time - scales of the accretor , @xmath23 , and donor , @xmath24 and are linearly proportional to the difference between the component and orbit spin , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 for the accretor and donor , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the angular velocity of the circular orbit : @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the moments of inertia of each component , with @xmath30 being the inertial constant .",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 determine the strength of tidal coupling relative to mt and gr .",
    "as in gokhale2007 , we examine both the cases of @xmath31 years ( weak tidal coupling ) and @xmath32 = 10 years ( strong tidal coupling ) .",
    "the tidal - synchronization timescales are discussed further in [ sec : sync ] .    to determine @xmath33",
    ", we follow paper i , which uses the ballistic mass transfer calculations of @xcite to determine the instantaneous effect of mass transfer on dwd systems .",
    "this method uses a fully self - consistent , conservative , ballistic model of the transferred mass to determine the orbital parameters of the system after a single mass - transfer event . as seen in that paper , provided the mass transferred is small compared to the total mass of the binary system , the change in the orbital parameters per unit mass that results is directly proportional to the mass transfer rate : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the change in the orbital angular momentum for the dwd as calculated by the above ballistic model for a single mass transfer event ejecting a particle of mass @xmath36 . in this method ,",
    "changes in @xmath37 ( and changes in all orbital parameters ) are calculated at each time - step by integrating the three - body system consisting of the two stars and the discrete particle representing the mass transfer stream .",
    "the change in the @xmath37 per unit mass transferred is independent of the mass of the ejected particle as long as @xmath38 . for the calculations here , we use @xmath39 .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath37 is then determined by multiplying by the current mass - transfer rate of our evolving dwd , @xmath40 . the calculation of @xmath41 will be discussed in section  [ sec : mt ] .      using the above rates of change for the orbital angular momentum , we are now ready to develop the equations for long - term evolution .",
    "it follows from equation  ( [ eq-2 ] ) that @xmath42 for conservative mass transfer ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we let @xmath44 .      as in section",
    "[ sec : angmom ] for the orbital angular momentum , we examine the changes of the semi - major axis due to mass transfer , tides , and gr .",
    "we assume that each effect is independent , and write the total change in the semi - major axis due to each of the above effects , respectively , as : @xmath45    to calculate @xmath46 , we utilize the model for mass transfer developed in @xcite .",
    "the differences between this model and models used in other analyses will be discussed in the section [ sec : diff ] . using this method",
    ", we calculate the time rate of change of @xmath14 due to mass transfer as @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the change in the semi - major axis for the dwd as calculated by the above ballistic model of @xcite as described in section  [ sec : angmom ] for the orbital angular momentum .",
    "next we calculate @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we can not use the standard tidal prescription for changes in the semi - major axis following @xcite because , following marsh2004 and gokhale2007 , we used a different metric for changing the spin angular momentum due to tides ( equation [ [ eq-6 ] ] ) .",
    "instead , we must develop @xmath49 from that angular momentum change .",
    "holding the donor mass constant ( @xmath51 ) for the final two terms of equation  ( [ eq-10 ] ) we can combine equation  ( [ eq-4 ] ) with equation  ( [ eq-7 ] ) to obtain : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total change of the semi - major axis due to the combined effects of tides and gr .",
    "assuming as before that changes to the semi - major axis due to tides and changes due to gr are independent we can re - write the above as : @xmath54 using equations  ( [ eq-2 ] ) , ( [ eq-5 ] ) , and ( [ eq-6 ] ) , it follows that : @xmath55 and @xmath56    for our purposes , we rewrite the two tidal components in terms of the rotation rates of the accretor and the donor relative to the orbital angular velocity , which we define as @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . the rotation rates can be written in terms of the rotational angular velocities of the stars , @xmath59 and the angular velocity of the circular orbit , @xmath27 : @xmath60    using equations  ( [ eq - omega ] ) and ( [ eq-13 ] ) , we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq-15 ] ) as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63    finally , we can insert equations  ( [ eq-11 ] ) , ( [ eq-16 ] ) , and ( [ eq-14 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq-10 ] ) to obtain the equation for the evolution of the semi - major axis with time : @xmath64      next , we find the equations for the evolution of the component spins , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . like the changes to the semi - major axis ( equation  [ [ eq-10 ] ] ) , the changes in @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be separated into three components : @xmath65 with @xmath26 .",
    "analogous to @xmath66 in equation  ( [ eq-11 ] ) , the change in @xmath67 due to mass transfer , @xmath68 can be written as : @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the change in the rotation rates of star @xmath71 resulting from a single mass transfer event in the formulation of @xcite as described in section  [ sec : angmom ] .    as in equation  ( [ eq-3 ] )",
    ", the spin angular momentum of each component can be written as @xmath72 where we have substituted @xmath67 from equation  ( [ eq-13 ] ) .    since we have already determined the change in @xmath67 due to mass transfer ( equation  [ [ eq-21 ] ] )",
    ", we can determine @xmath73 and @xmath74 by differentiating equation  ( [ eq-22 ] ) with the mass held constant : @xmath75 where the second term arises due to the dependence of @xmath27 on the semi - major axis ( equation  [ [ eq - omega ] ] ) .",
    "we note that , because we are holding the mass constant , the second term depends only upon changes due to tides and gr , and not changes due to mass transfer .",
    "changes to @xmath67 due to the effect of mass transfer on the semi - major axis are fully accounted for by equation  ( [ eq-21 ] ) .",
    "since we do not include any gr effects on the spin angular momentum of the components , conservation of angular momentum dictates that any changes in the spin angular momentum of a component must be equal and opposite to the changes in the orbital angular momentum of the system due to tides acting on that component . combining equations  ( [ eq-6 ] ) , ( [ eq - omega ] ) , and ( [ eq-13 ] )",
    ", we have : @xmath76    by combining equations  ( [ eq-23 ] ) and ( [ eq-25 ] ) and rearranging , we can write @xmath77 as : @xmath78   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we have used equations  ( [ eq-16 ] ) , ( [ eq-14])([eq - alpha ] ) , and let : @xmath79    following the form of equation  ( [ eq-20 ] ) , we can combine equations  ( [ eq-21 ] ) and ( [ eq-26 ] ) to write the equations for the evolution of @xmath57 and @xmath58 : @xmath80\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath81.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we assume that the eccentricity of these systems is zero prior to the onset of direct - impact accretion . during the three - body integration of a single mass - transfer event ,",
    "it is possible for the binary to develop a small eccentricity .",
    "however , for simplicity and in accordance with marsh2004 and gokhale2007 , we force the eccentricity to remain zero throughout . because the system begins in a circular orbit , and due to the action of tidal forces and gravitational wave emission which both act to circularize the orbit , it is unlikely for any significant eccentricity to develop .",
    "in order to keep this orbital angular momentum in the orbit , we manually set our new semi - major axis to : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the eccentricity gained by the system during mass transfer and @xmath84 is the semi - major axis of the eccentric orbit . using this modification , we force : @xmath85 and still conserve orbital angular momentum . a more thorough analysis in which we allow eccentricity to vary throughout the entire calculation",
    "will be presented in a forthcoming paper .      finally , the changes in the masses of the accretor and donor are given , respectively , by : @xmath86 @xmath87 the mass loss rate of the donor , @xmath40 is obtained as described in section  [ sec : mt ] .",
    "together , the set of equations  ( [ eq - a ] ) , ( [ eq-27 ] ) , ( [ eq-28 ] ) , ( [ eq-19 ] ) , ( [ eq-29 ] ) , ( [ eq-30 ] ) can be integrated in time to calculate the evolution of the system .",
    "there are several differences between our treatment of mass transfer and those of marsh2004 and gokhale2007 . in order to calculate the angular momentum exchange during mass transfer ,",
    "the studies of marsh2004 and gokhale2007 both utilize a numerical prescription based on @xcite . in that formulation",
    ", it is assumed that the angular momentum transferred from the orbit to the spin of the accretor is exactly equal to the angular momentum of the ballistic particle in a circular orbit around the donor at its average radius during its motion from donor to accretor . where the analysis of marsh2004 keeps the spin of the donor fixed",
    ", gokale2007 does allow the spin of the donor to vary , and notes that in doing so , the number of stable systems increases . however , the allowance of variation in donor spin is not done self - consistently . by introducing the spin angular momentum of the donor ,",
    "there are now three separate sources / sinks of angular momentum : the spin of the donor , the spin of the accretor , and the orbit .",
    "paper i showed that angular momentum is transferred between each during mass transfer , and that the fraction of angular momentum transferred between each is strongly dependent on the ballistic trajectory of the transferred mass , and hence the system properties . in this paper",
    ", we apply the ballistic calculations of paper i to lift the dependence on the @xcite approximations to more accurately determine the flow of angular momentum between the component spins and the orbit .",
    "since orbital angular momentum changes are directly linked to changes in the mass ratio and semi - major axis , much can be learned from analyses such as that of gokhale2007 and marsh2004 .",
    "however , a more complete analysis demands a thorough consideration of the spin angular momenta of the stars as well due to their indirect effect upon the system properties through tidal coupling .",
    "this is accomplished via the ballistic calculations described above , which evaluate the three - body problem throughout the evolution of the system to determine the precise effect mass transfer has on the evolution of the system .",
    "these calculations take into account not only the immediate feedback on the orbit and spin of the accretor during ejection , but also ( 1 ) the gravitational effect on the orbit during the mass transfer process , ( 2 ) a calculation of the precise moment when the particle impacts the surface of the accretor , ( 3 ) the instantaneous properties of both the accretor and particle at impact , including the angle of impact , and ( 4 ) correctly divides the momentum of the impacting particle between linear and angular momentum based upon the angle of impact and the rotation rate of the accretor .",
    "we can then examine the angular momentum exchange between all components , the spins of both stars and the orbit , and do so in a way that allows the spins of both stars to vary self - consistently .      as in marsh2004",
    ", we define the overfill of the roche lobe as : @xmath88 where @xmath3 is the radius of the donor and @xmath89 is the radius of the donor s roche lobe .",
    "the way in which the mass - transfer rate varies with @xmath90 has been investigated in many analyses ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in accordance with marsh2004 , we approximate the mass transfer as adiabatic @xcite . in the adiabatic regime",
    "the mass transfer rate is given by : @xmath91 for @xmath92 and zero for @xmath93 ( using results from @xcite ) .",
    "here , @xmath94 is the mass of an electron , @xmath95 is the mass of a nucleon , @xmath96 is the mean number of nucleons per free electron in the outer layers of the donor ( assumed here to be two ) , @xmath97 is the orbital period , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 are given by the following : @xmath101 @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the distance from the center of the donor to the inner lagrangian point of the donor , in units of the semi - major axis @xcite .      in the case of marsh2004 , where the rotational velocity of the donor is fixed to the orbital velocity and where the orbit is circular throughout , the shape and volume of the roche lobe depends only upon the mass ratio of the system . in that case , the approximation from @xcite , @xmath104 is sufficient .",
    "however , for eccentric and/or non - synchronous binaries , the shape and volume of the roche lobe also depend upon the eccentricity , the true anomaly , @xmath105 , and the rotation rate , which can be expressed by the parameter : @xmath106 see @xcite .",
    "other analyses have considered the dependence of the roche lobe on asynchronicity . in the case of a circular orbit ,",
    "the roche lobes described in @xcite using the roche - lobe parameter @xmath107 directly reflect the equipotential surfaces described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that this asynchronicity parameter @xmath108 depends on the rotation rate of the component star in question , which means the size of the roche lobe can be different for each object in the system .    for our calculations",
    ", we perform a monte carlo integration to calculate the volume - equivalent roche lobe radius ( as outlined in @xcite ) over a two - dimensional grid in @xmath109-@xmath110 parameter - space .",
    "we then use a bilinear interpolation function to create a continuous function for the roche lobe from the two - dimensional grid .",
    "the interpolated function is accurate to 0.01 percent or better in comparison to the monte carlo integration at equivalent points .    in section  [ sec : rlasynch ] , we examine the dependence of the results on the size of the roche lobe .",
    "there , we compare the evolution of the dwd systems using the eggleton function for the roche lobe , @xmath111 , to the evolution including the asynchronicity parameter which we name @xmath112 .      as the spin angular momentum of the accretor increases due to impact from the mass transfer stream",
    ", tidal coupling will redistribute some of this angular momentum back into the orbit .",
    "the strength of this tidal coupling is dependent upon the synchronization time - scales , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as seen in equation  ( [ eq-6 ] ) .",
    "@xcite calculated this timescale as : @xmath113^{5/7 } yr\\ ] ]    following marsh2004 , we retain the scaling with mass ratio and orbital separation , but , because of the uncertainty of the overall magnitude of the time - scale , we allow the magnitude to vary . we define the overall magnitude by the time - scale at the moment of first contact and assume , as in marsh2004 and gokhale2007 , that @xmath114 and @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are constants defined such that @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "here , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the initial synchronization time - scales . as in gokhale2007",
    ", we explore two different values for the synchronization time - scale at contact : @xmath122 years ( very weak tidal coupling ) and 10 years ( very strong tidal coupling ) .",
    "much work on tidal synchronization in dwds has been done ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "these analyses have shown that shorter synchronization time - scales may be a better approximation for systems with short orbital periods , as we consider in this analysis , which may lend credence to our 10 year synchronization time - scale . for simplicity , we use the same initial time - scale for the donor and accretor ( @xmath123 ) and refer to the initial synchronization time - scale for both stars as simply @xmath124 .",
    "we have now determined the set of differential equations which governs the evolution of the dwds undergoing direct - impact accretion , including the methods for calculating the roche lobe size , the mass transfer rate , and the synchronization timescales which determine the strength of tidal coupling .",
    "we now have all the steps in place to solve for the long - term evolution of the systems .",
    "we integrate equations  ( [ eq - a ] ) , ( [ eq-27 ] ) , ( [ eq-28 ] ) , ( [ eq-19 ] ) , ( [ eq-29 ] ) , ( [ eq-30 ] ) using an 8th order runge kutta ordinary differential equation solver @xcite . excluding the losses due to gravitational radiation , the total energy and momentum of the system",
    "are conserved throughout the integration over the entire parameter space to one part in @xmath125 or better . at the end of the evolution , we calculate @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the initial total angular momentum and @xmath128 is the total angular momentum lost to gravitational radiation . if angular momentum is perfectly conserved , we expect @xmath129 to be equal to zero .",
    "figure 1 shows the final value of @xmath129 for both synchronization time - scales at contact over the entire parameter space of interest for solutions calculated using both the eggleton approximation ( left ) , @xmath130 , and @xmath112 ( right ) for the calculation of the roche lobe .",
    "the colors correspond to different values of @xmath129 as described in the caption . in general , systems with a smaller total mass conserve total angular momentum better than systems with a higher mass . for many of the systems in the lower right , this is due to the fact that they reach a stable configuration ( disc accretion ) early in the integration .",
    "therefore , the integration needs to run for only a few orbits .",
    "systems where @xmath129 is larger tend to be systems where the numerical integration runs for many orbits , allowing systematic errors in the numerical integration to accumulate .",
    "even so , all systems presented in this paper conserve total angular momentum to better than 1% throughout the entire evolution .",
    "we integrate over a period of 1 gyr . as in marsh2004 ,",
    "if @xmath41 exceeds 0.01 @xmath131yr at any point during the integration , the integration stops and the system is discarded as unstable .    as a system evolves",
    ", it is possible to pass back and forth through phases of mass transfer and phases of no mass transfer as the semi - major axis and the two masses change .",
    "if the semi - major axis increases enough for mass transfer to stop altogether , the integration proceeds ( with @xmath51 ) until the action of gravitational radiation shrinks the orbit sufficiently for mass transfer to resume .    as in paper",
    "i , in this work we are only interested in direct - impact mass transfer where the particle impacts the surface of the accretor within one orbital period . in this case , the evolution of the orbital parameters is determined by the differential equations presented in section 2 .",
    "if the particle does not accrete within one orbital period , it is likely that the accretion stream will eventually intersect with itself , ultimately leading to the formation of an accretion disc @xcite .",
    "[ t ! ] [ fig - conserve ]    compared to direct - impact accretion , disc accretion is known to provide a much more efficient mechanism for redistributing spin angular momentum in the accretor back into the orbit through tidal coupling @xcite . as a result , it is likely that once a system enters a phase of disc accretion it will remain in this phase or perhaps even become detached as the orbital separation continues to grow and the mass ratio decreases due to continued mass transfer .",
    "if at any point during our numerical integrations a disc is formed under these circumstances , the integration stops and the system is assumed to be stable throughout its lifetime . a more thorough analysis which continues to track the evolution through potential disc phases will be performed in a future paper .",
    "this issue is discussed further in section 4 .      for weak tidal coupling",
    ", it is possible for the accretor to be spun up to its breakup rate ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "we track @xmath4 throughout our calculations and note that only one system ever reaches this maximum spin for the accretor .",
    "this system , which has an initial donor mass of @xmath133 and an initial accretor mass of @xmath134 , is marked by a yellow dot in figure 2 .",
    "the accretor spin - rates in all other systems stay below the breakup rate throughout their evolution .      as noted by marsh2004",
    ", there are likely ranges of parameter space where systems , despite being stable , experience super - eddington accretion at some point during their evolution .",
    "it is expected that a possible ultimate consequence of sustained super - eddington accretion is a merger @xcite , the same result as a dynamically unstable system , as they eventually can reach very high mass - transfer rates .",
    "as in marsh2004 , we calculate the eddington accretion rate using a modified form of the calculation used by @xcite : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the thomson cross - section of the electron , @xmath137 is the mass of a proton , @xmath138 is the impact velocity of the accreted particle , and @xmath139 is the spin - velocity of the accretor s surface at the point of impact , both measured in the co - rotating frame of reference .    in the marsh2004 analysis ,",
    "a set of impact velocities and locations were pre - computed and were interpolated during the calculations to calculate @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "instead we are able to calculate @xmath138 and @xmath139 explicitly as part of the three - body integration of the mass transfer event .",
    "we track the mass - transfer and flag systems that eventually exceed the maximum mass - transfer as unstable .",
    "[ t ! ]    using the techniques described above , we computed evolution over a grid in @xmath0,@xmath1 parameter space to determine the long - term stability of various systems .",
    "the grid was computed for two different tidal synchronization time - scales at contact : @xmath122 years and 10 years .",
    "we first present the results of our numerical integrations using the standard eggleton approximation for the calculation of the roche lobe ( equation  [ [ eq-35 ] ] ) , which does not take into account asynchronicity between the donor and orbit .",
    "the eggleton approximation was was used in the analyses of both marsh2004 and gokale2007 .",
    "figure 2 shows the end result of systems with an initial synchronization time - scale of @xmath140 years using @xmath130 .",
    "as mentioned in section 3 , we assume that once a disc is reached , the system will remain stable for the remainder of its evolution , therefore we stop the integration once a disc is formed . with the exception of the unstable black systems ( whose evolution stops when the mass transfer rate exceeds the maximum limit of @xmath141yr ) , the evolution of all systems in this plot",
    "is stopped when the system reaches a phase of disc accretion . the time it takes to reach this phase of disc accretion varies from system to system .",
    "the solid black line in figure 2 shows the boundary between disc and direct - impact accretion for initially synchronous and circular binaries .",
    "all systems to the right of and below this line begin evolution in a disc phase .",
    "therefore , these systems are assumed stable from the onset of evolution and do not evolve past @xmath142 .",
    "since these systems do not evolve in time , the angular momentum is perfectly conserved , as shown by the black systems in the lower right of the plots in figure 1 .",
    "all systems to the left of and above this line begin evolution in a direct - impact phase .",
    "we will discuss how we handle disc accretion further in section 4.2 .",
    "figure 3 , analogous to figure 2 , shows the end results of systems with initial synchronization time - scales of @xmath143years using @xmath130 for the roche lobe calculation .",
    "the sub - chandrasekhar , sub - eddington systems shown in red in figures 2 and 3 are expected to remain stable throughout their lifetimes and are therefore characterized as likely am cvn progenitors .",
    "as observed from the dotted and dashed black lines in figures 2 and 3 , the region of parameter space occupied by such systems in gokhale2007 ( dashed line ) increased the number of stable systems compared to marsh2004 ( dotted line ) ; our analysis reveals a further increase in the extent of this region of parameter space .",
    "this observation holds true for both the @xmath122 year time - scale ( figure 2 ) and the 10 year time - scale ( figure 3 ) .",
    "gokhale2007 noted that by allowing the spin of the donor to vary and by including the resulting effects of tidal coupling between the donor s spin and the orbit , the number of stable systems increased compared to the analysis of marsh2004 ( as observed by comparing the dotted versus dashed lines in both figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "as described in section 2.4 , the main difference between our analysis and that of gokhale2007 is in the treatment of the way we handle angular momentum evolution during the direct impact accretion process . in observing the increase in the number of stable systems compared to the analysis of gokhale2007 , we conclude that by utilizing a mass transfer treatment that allows the rotation rates of both components to vary and self - consistently accounts for the exchange of angular momentum between the spins of the components and the orbit , we are able to increase the number of stable systems .    figures 2 and 3 , produced using @xmath130 for the roche lobe calculation , isolate the effect of our different treatment of the mass transfer process has upon the stability of systems in comparison with marsh2004 and gokhale2007 .",
    "we will discuss the differences resulting from using @xmath112 in section 4.4 .",
    "forming a boundary between the stable ( red and blue ) and unstable ( black ) systems are the green and magenta systems , which experience super - eddington accretion at some point during the integration . unlike the black systems , whose mass transfer exceeds the allowed limit of @xmath144yr and are therefore categorized as unstable , these green / magenta super - eddington systems are categorized as stable .",
    "however , it is likely that systemic mass loss is needed for a binary to survive phases of super - eddington accretion .",
    "@xcite argues that such mass loss may lead to a common envelope surrounding the binary , which will ultimately lead to a merger . in this case ,",
    "systems which experience super - eddington accretion would be considered unstable systems .",
    "the analyses of marsh2004 and gokhale2007 both note that super - eddington systems are expected to be unstable .",
    "we make the same assumption but note that a more thorough treatment of the physics governing systems as they pass through any phases of super - eddington accretion is necessary to state with certainty whether or not such systems are ultimately stable or unstable .",
    "the green super - eddington systems have a total mass which is sub - chandrasekhar , and the magenta super - eddington systems are super - chandrasekhar .",
    "if we assume super - eddington systems are ultimately unstable , the magenta systems can be categorized as possible type ia supernova progenitors .    as the tidal synchronization time - scale is reduced from @xmath145 years in figure 2 to @xmath146 years in figure 3 , we see the parameter space occupied by stable systems grows ( red ) .",
    "this is to be expected and in agreement with the analyses of marsh2004 and gokhale2007 .",
    "stronger tidal coupling will allow more spin angular momentum from the accretor to be transferred back into the orbit , which increases the semi - major axis , causing the mass - transfer rate to decrease .",
    "this results in an increase the stability of the systems in general .",
    "[ t ! ]    in both figures 2 and 3 we see a portion of stable , super - chandrasekhar , sub - eddington systems ( blue ) in the top right corners of our plots . in the analyses of both marsh2004 and gokhale2007 , this portion of parameter space",
    "is occupied by super - eddington systems , which would be magenta circles in our plots .",
    "notice that the dotted and dashed lines of marsh2004 and gokhale2007 decrease as we move right across the plot , whereas our stability boundary is more extended .",
    "this is due to the fact that we do not follow the evolution of the systems past the development of disc accretion , while marsh2004 and gokhale2007 both continue to track the evolution of systems through phases of disc accretion .    here",
    "we acknowledge the main limitation of our decision to assume that systems are stable once they reach a phase of disc accretion .",
    "the blue systems in the region of parameter space of interest here begin the integration in a disc phase , and are therefore labeled as stable .",
    "however , it is feasible that if these high donor - mass systems were allowed to evolve through the initial disc phase , they would eventually become super - eddington and potentially unstable . in this case",
    ", this region of parameter space would more closely conform with the shape of marsh2004 s and gokhale2007 s analyses , both of which allow the systems to continue evolving through any phases of disc accretion . as we noted earlier , a more thorough analysis of this region of parameter space which includes treatment of disc accretion",
    "will be studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "figure 4 shows the evolution in time of a system with initial masses of @xmath147 and @xmath148 for the two different synchronization timescales at contact as well as a third much stronger tidal timescale , @xmath149 year , for further illustration .",
    "these solutions are obtained using @xmath130 to calculate the roche lobe . for @xmath150 years",
    ", the system is unstable , for @xmath151 years the system is stable , but passes through a phase of super - eddington accretion , and for @xmath152 year the system is stable and sub - eddington .    for weak tidal coupling ( @xmath140 years ) , shown in black",
    ", mass transfer causes the rotation rates of the donor and accretor to rapidly decrease and increase , respectively . for the case of stronger tidal coupling ( @xmath146 years and @xmath149 year ; shown in green and red , respectively ) , tidal forces exist to redistribute angular momentum , working to keep the spins of the donor and accretor synchronous with the orbit ( @xmath153 ) .    the rapid increase in the semi - major axis for @xmath140 years is a direct result of the conservation of angular momentum : the angular momentum lost during the spin - down and mass loss of the donor is greater than the angular momentum gained by the accretor .",
    "the net decrease in spin angular momentum corresponds to an increase in the orbital angular momentum , increasing the semi - major axis .",
    "the mass transfer rate increases rapidly as the mass loss from the donor causes the radius to increase , even as the roche lobe grows due to the increasing semi - major axis ( see equations  [ [ eq-31 ] ] and [ [ eq-32 ] ] ) .    for the case of strong tidal coupling ( @xmath154year )",
    "we see a significant decrease in the mass transfer rate , with a correspondingly slower increase in the semi - major axis .",
    "the rotation rates of the component white dwarfs remain closer to synchronous , and we do not see the rapid runaway that is evident in the case of weak tidal coupling .    finally , we note that oscillations in the orbital parameters are seen in the @xmath155 year case , which have been observed before by gokhale2007 .",
    "these oscillations are sensitive to small changes in the initial orbital parameters .",
    "we discuss this phenomenon further in section  4.5 .",
    "[ t ! ]    here , we show the results of our numerical integrations using @xmath112 to calculate the roche - lobe size . as discussed in section 2.6 ,",
    "the eggleton approximation is dependent upon only the mass ratio of the binary , whereas @xmath112 accounts for deviations from synchronism .",
    "figure 5 shows the end results of the systems with initial synchronization time - scales of @xmath140 years and evolved using @xmath112 .",
    "the color code remains the same as in figures 2 and 3 and the dotted and dashed lines from marsh2004 and gokhale2007 , respectively , for the @xmath122 year time - scale are included for reference . as can be seen ,",
    "this plot is nearly identical to figure 2 , which was calculated using the eggleton approximation .",
    "figure 6 shows the end results of the systems which begin with synchronization time - scales of @xmath146 years . by comparing with figure 3",
    ", we observe that , unlike the @xmath122 year time - scale , @xmath112 has a significant effect upon the end - states of the systems for the 10 year time - scale .",
    "in particular , the number of unstable black systems is reduced substantially .",
    "the cause of this difference is explained in details below ( section 4.5 ) .",
    "[ t ! ]    in figure 6 , we also observe a slight increase in the number of stable systems across the entire range of accretor masses compared to figure 3 .",
    "additionally , there is a small group of stable red systems beyond the widely - used @xmath156 boundary for instability ( for @xmath156 , the donor radius will expand faster than the roche lobe which suggests , simplistically , that such systems will become unstable ) .",
    "however , it is possible for systems with an initial mass ratio higher than 2/3 to survive , provided that the mass ratio is close to the boundary ( see , for example , @xcite ) . our results ,",
    "as shown in figure 6 , confirm this observation .      [",
    "t ! ]    figure 7 compares the evolution of a system with an initial donor mass of 0.3 @xmath157 and an initial accretor mass of 0.8 @xmath157 for @xmath140 years . on left",
    "we show the evolution of various orbital parameters obtained using the eggleton approximation for the roche lobe calculation .",
    "the right side mirrors the left but shows the evolution using @xmath112 instead of @xmath130 . as seen on the plots , the evolution of the orbital parameters happens on a much shorter time - scale for the @xmath111 solution than for the @xmath112 solution .",
    "this is due to the fact that , as mass is transferred from the donor to the accretor , the rotation rate of the donor decreases relative to the orbit and the rotation rate of the accretor increases .",
    "as the donor spin ( @xmath58 ) decreases , @xmath109 ( which is proportional to @xmath158 ; equation  [ eq-36 ] ) also decreases .",
    "when using @xmath112 , the size of the roche lobe is inversely proportional to @xmath109 .",
    "so , as @xmath109 decreases , the roche lobe will increase , which ultimately reduces the mass transfer rate .",
    "however , in the @xmath130 calculation , the roche lobe is insensitive to changes in @xmath58 , so the mass transfer rate is higher relative to that calculated in the solution using @xmath112 . since the mass transfer rate is higher in the eggleton case , the orbital parameters change more quickly than in the @xmath112 case , as seen in figure 7 .",
    "[ t ! ]    [ t ! ]    figure 8 compares the evolution of a system with an initial donor mass of @xmath159 and an initial accretor mass of @xmath160 with @xmath143years for the first 1000 years of evolution .",
    "figure 9 shows the full evolution of this system , which evolved out to approximately @xmath161 years before reaching a phase of disc accretion . as in figure 7",
    ", the left panel shows the evolution using @xmath130 and the right panel shows the evolution using @xmath112 .",
    "as can be seen in figures 3 and 5 , this system is stable under the @xmath112 calculation and super - eddington under the @xmath130 calculation . unlike the @xmath122 year time - scale , for the 10 year time - scale ,",
    "the orbital parameters follow approximately the same path in both the @xmath111 and @xmath112 cases , with the exception being the oscillations seen when using @xmath162 .",
    "we discuss these oscillations in more detail below .      as seen in figure 8 , using @xmath112 to calculate the roche lobe damps the oscillations observed when using the @xmath130 . in both cases , the mass transfer rate increases initially , which causes the accretor to spin up and the donor to spin down . in the @xmath112 case , this causes the mass transfer rate to increase at a slower rate relative to the @xmath130 case .",
    "decreases , @xmath109 decreases , which causes the roche lobe to increase and reduces the mass transfer rate . ] as discussed above , when using @xmath130 , the mass transfer rate will continue to increase until tides have transferred sufficient angular momentum from the spin of the components to the orbit to widen the orbit and reduce the mass transfer rate .",
    "once this occurs , the mass transfer rate is reduced and tides continue to redistribute angular momentum between the component spins and the orbit ( in this case the donor is spun up while the accretor is spun down ) . but again , because changes in the donor spin are not accounted for when using @xmath162 , the mass transfer rate will again  over shoot \" and the oscillations continue .",
    "the dependence of the roche lobe radius upon the donor spin when using @xmath112 slows the changes in the mass transfer rate and damps the oscillations .",
    "although figure 8 shows that the short - term evolution of this particular system differs substantially between the @xmath130 and @xmath112 roche lobe calculations , figure 9 shows that the long - term evolution of this system is very similar .",
    "although the oscillations do not impact the long - term evolution of many of the systems , the oscillations do impact whether a system is categorized as sub - eddington or super - eddington or whether it reaches unstable levels of mass transfer . in the case of the system illustrated in figures 8 and 9 ,",
    "the oscillations cause the system briefly to become super - eddington , while the system would remain sub - eddington in the absence of oscillations",
    ".    in general , as the mass transfer rates spike initially under the @xmath130 calculation before ultimately settling to the @xmath112 value , it may reach super - eddington or unstable levels , while , in the @xmath112 case , the mass transfer rate may remain stable instead of super - eddington , or super - eddington instead of unstable . this explains the lack of unstable black systems in figure 5 compared to figure 3 . for the systems shown in figure 3 , the oscillations in the orbital parameters arising from the use of @xmath162 may cause the mass transfer rate to reach artificially high values before the oscillations relax , leading to the large population of black systems at the top of the figure .",
    "meanwhile , since using @xmath112 damps the oscillations , the mass transfer rate is able to stay below the limit for stability of 0.01 @xmath131yr .",
    "[ t ! ]    both marsh2004 and gokhale2007 noted the presence of oscillations in the orbital parameters near the boundary between stable and unstable systems .",
    "these analyses observed that , for such systems , small changes in the synchronization time - scales and in the mass ratio will cause changes in the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "figures 10 and 11 show the evolution of the orbital period for various synchronization time - scales and mass ratios , respectively , using both @xmath130 and @xmath112 to calculate the size of the roche lobe .",
    "these figures confirm the observations of marsh2004 and gokhale2007 that the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations is dependent upon both the mass ratio and the synchronization time - scale .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure 10 illustrates that the amplitude of the oscillations increases with increasing initial synchronization time - scale , while the frequency of the oscillations decreases .",
    "these oscillations can be explained as follows : once mass transfer begins , if the system is unstable or nearly unstable , the time - scale for changes in the mass transfer rate becomes greater than the time - scale at which the semi - major axis increases due to tides . as a result",
    ", @xmath40 increases rapidly and the accretor spin increases significantly .",
    "the result is a large asynchronicity between the accretor , the orbit , and the donor . as the orbital separation increases due to the effect of tides",
    ", @xmath40 decreases , until the timescale for changes in the mass transfer rate becomes less than the time - scale at which the semi - major axis increases due to tides . at this point , tides are able to redistribute angular momentum from the spin of the accretor back into the orbit .",
    "if enough angular momentum is transferred back into the orbit , the donor becomes detached .",
    "once tides effectively re - synchronize the spins of the stars with the orbit , gravitational wave losses act to bring the binary back into contact , and the entire cycle repeats .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure 10 demonstrates that , for this particular mass ratio , the oscillations are not present when using @xmath112 to calculate the size of the roche lobe .",
    "furthermore , the right - hand panel illustrates that , in the absence of oscillations , the orbital period , and therefore , the semi - major axis increases more rapidly for lower @xmath124 values of the synchronization timescale . for lower @xmath124 values , the tidal coupling is stronger , which means spin angular momentum is able to be re - distributed more efficiently , which allows the semi - major axis to remain larger compared to the semi - major axis of systems evolved using higher values of @xmath124 .",
    "figure 11 demonstrates the effect of mass ratio upon the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "as gokhale2007 observes , we see that for a fixed @xmath124 value , a lower mass ratio ( top two graphs of figure 11 ) yields oscillations of lower amplitude compared to a higher mass ratio ( lower two graphs of figure 11 ) . in figure 3",
    ", we see that switching from a mass ratio of 0.475 to 0.425 moves us away from the boundary which separates super - eddington systems from stable systems .",
    "this demonstrates that , in general , as we move away from the stability boundary , the oscillations are reduced .",
    "the two right - hand panels of figure 11 show the evolution using @xmath112 for the roche lobe .",
    "this again demonstrates that oscillations are not present when the roche lobe depends on the asynchronicity between the donor and orbit .",
    "we have studied the long - term evolution of dwd binary systems undergoing direct - impact mass transfer , including the effects due to mass transfer , gravitational radiation , and tidal forces arising from asynchronicity between the donor , accretor , and the orbit .",
    "we implemented the ballistic mass - transfer treatment developed in @xcite to calculate the changes to orbital parameters during direct - impact mass transfer . by implementing this method",
    ", we found that the number of stable dwd systems increased for both weak and strong tidal coupling compared with the results of marsh2004 and gokhale2007 , as shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "for the first time , we also account for the modification of the roche - lobe size due to the asynchronicity of the donor . as a result",
    ", we find that the number of stable systems increases , particularly for the case of strong tidal coupling , as shown in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "when not accounting for the asynchronicity effects on the roche - lobe size , we reproduce the oscillations in the orbital parameters first noted by gokhale2007 .",
    "we found that , when the size of the roche lobe was permitted to vary with donor asynchronicity , these oscillations were dampened , as shown in figure 8 .",
    "we conclude that the oscillations created when using the eggleton approximation for the roche lobe calculation create artificially high mass transfer rates which leads to an artificially high number of super - eddington and unstable systems . by eliminating the oscillations , our treatment yields a higher number of sub - eddington and stable systems .",
    "we expect systems which are stable throughout our calculations ( red systems in figures 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) to be am cvn progenitors . as a result of the increase in stable systems shown here compared to previous analyses ,",
    "we conclude that dwd evolution may be a more likely avenue for the creation of am cvn than previously expected .    in future analyses ,",
    "we intend to investigate the case of initially eccentric binaries with asynchronous component stars , as we expect there may be a significant population of dwds that have not had time to circularize and synchronize by the time mass transfer occurs @xcite .",
    "additionally , we intend to implement a treatment of disc accretion so that we can track the evolution of the dwd systems through all types of accretion processes .",
