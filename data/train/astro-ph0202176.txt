    "after a decade of hst observations , the luminosity function ( lf ) of unevolved main sequence ( ms ) stars has been derived for several galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) . in many cases",
    "the lf extends down to the faintest stellar objects ( @xmath0 ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for unevolved stars , the luminosity directly tracks the mass , the most fundamental parameter of a star .",
    "the determination of the initial mass function ( imf ) from the observed lf of main sequence stars , as well as the study of the of the variation of the lf within a given cluster and among different clusters is now a well established field of research which has provided important insights on the dynamical evolution of gccs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the signature of mass segregation , due to the energy equipartition established by two body encounters among clusters stars , has been detected in many clusters by comparing the lfs obtained at different distances from the cluster center .",
    "also , the effect of the pruning of the outer extremities of the clusters by the galactic tidal field or by the violent interaction with the galactic bulge and disc have been shown with the analysis of the lf of ms stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    here",
    "we present the ms lf of the globular cluster ngc  288 down to @xmath1 .",
    "the lf was based on hst - wfpc2 observations that are described in detail in a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pap i ) , that was devoted to the study of the binary population of this cluster . in pap i",
    "we used a method very similar to the one adopted by @xcite , based on extensive sets of artificial star experiments , to estimate the global binary fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the cluster ( @xmath3 % @xmath4 % ) and to show that binary systems are spatially segregated within the cluster .",
    "these same artificial star experiments can be used to obtain lfs in different regions of the cluster , _ corrected for all observational effects_. in  2 we will briefly recall the characteristics of the adopted sample and of the artificial star experiments , as well as the results of pap i that are relevant in the present context . in ",
    "3 we introduce a _ new method _ to correct the observed lf .",
    "the effect of the presence of binary systems on the final lf is also discussed and quantified with the support of the analysis performed in pap i. in  4 we present the final lf of ngc  288 and compare it with the lfs of other clusters and , finally , in  5 we summarize our results .",
    "ngc  288 is a loose ( @xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) cluster .",
    "it is a classical old ggc @xcite with a blue horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "its stars are not exceedingly metal deficient ( @xmath6}=-1.39 $ ] ) and have the abundance pattern typical of halo stars @xcite .",
    "the cluster lies on a very inclined and eccentric orbit that carries it into the inner , denser region of the galaxy , where the effects of galactic tides and disc / bulge shocks are more disruptive .",
    "according to @xcite the perigalactic distance is @xmath7 kpc , the eccentricity is @xmath8 , the orbital period is @xmath9 years , and the `` destruction rate '' is one of the highest in the ggc system .",
    "the observed distance from the galactic center ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath10 kpc ; ) indicates that the cluster is presently near the apogalactic point of its orbit ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the observations , the data reduction process and the artificial star experiments are described in detail in pap  i. here we summarize the points that are relevant in the present context .",
    "two hst - wfpc2 fields were observed in the f555w and f814w passbands : one with the pc camera nearly centered on the center of the cluster ( int field ) , and one with the wf4 camera partially overlapping the wf3-int field ( ext field ; see fig .  1 of pap  i ) .",
    "the int field is almost completely enclosed in the region within 1 half light radius ( @xmath11 ; where @xmath12 is the core radius ) * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the ext field samples a region contained in the annulus @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance from the cluster center .",
    "the data were transformed to the standard johnson - kron - cousins photometric system by calibration to the ground - based data of @xcite .",
    "the int sample contains 5766 sources from @xmath15 to @xmath16 and the ext one contains 2013 sources between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the large majority of the observed stars are fainter than the turn off ( to ) point ( @xmath19 ) , and hence are unevolved ms stars ( and/or binary systems containing _ two _ unevolved ms stars ; see pap  i ) .",
    "the f336w and f225w observations of the int field that has been shortly discussed in pap  i are not used in the present paper .",
    "simulations containing more than 80,000 artificial stars per chip have been made on the @xmath20 frames . in each run of the artificial stars experiments @xmath21 artificial stars per chip",
    "were added at the same position in the median image ( that we used as a master - frame to obtain a list of positions of _ bona fide stars _ ; see pap  i ) and in each of the single frames ( that were used to obtain accurate photometry ; see pap  i ) .",
    "the set of experiments for a given chip ( sub - field ) was completed with @xmath22 independent runs .",
    "the final total number of artificial star experiments is @xmath23 . for each artificial star a random input @xmath24 magnitude",
    "is drawn from a distribution similar to the observed lf extrapolated to magnitudes slightly below the observed lower limit .",
    "this fainter limit was required so that the simulations would contain a large number of stars fainter than the observed limiting magnitude to correctly sample the magnitude bins where the incompleteness is expected to be highest ( see pap  i ) .",
    "we ultimately derive the true lf in a way that does not depend on the assumed artificial star lf ( see  3.2 ) . the input @xmath25 is obtained from the input @xmath24 using the cluster ridge line .",
    "each simulated star thus had the appropriate color and was simultaneously added to the corresponding @xmath24 and @xmath25 frames at the same position .",
    "the simulated stars were randomly distributed on the frames with an additional constraint ( see pap  i and also * ? ? ? * for a detailed description of the method ) preventing any interference between simulated stars . in practice , for each run of the artificial stars experiment , only one artificial star is added in each @xmath26 pixel portion of a chip .",
    "the whole process of data reduction has been repeated on all the frames with artificial stars added and the _ output _ magnitudes have been recorded ( see pap  i , for details ) .",
    "1 shows the _ input _ and _ output _",
    "cmds for the stars simulated in the pc - int , pc - ext , wf2-int and wf2-ext frames .",
    "the wf2 samples have been chosen as representative of the wf cameras for the int and ext fields . within a given field ( int and ext )",
    "the observations with the different wf cameras have very similar properties ( see pap  i ) .",
    "note the different response to the same input color - magnitude distribution in the four cases represented .",
    "this arises because the larger pixels of the wf cameras allow them to reach fainter limiting magnitudes than the pc camera and because the int and ext fields have different average degrees of crowding .",
    "all of the effects of the whole process of _ observation and data reduction _ on a large sample of stars representing a pure simple stellar population ( ssp ) are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "these effects can be imagined to be the results of the application of a multi - dimensional function ( that we will call observation / measure function ; hereafter omf ) on the _ true _ stars of the clusters , here represented by the input artificial stars lying on the ridge - line . in pap",
    "i the empirical knowledge of the effects of the omf has been used to extract the _ signal _ provided by the presence of a significant population of binary systems in the color distribution around the ridge - line from the observational noise due to random scatter , blending , etc . here",
    "we will use it to correct the observed lf from all the spurious deformations due to the same factors .",
    "the artificial star experiments have been carried out independently for each camera of each observed field .",
    "the completeness functions for each camera have been presented in fig .  5 of pap  i. the crowding conditions of the dataset are never particularly critical , and the completeness is rather similar everywhere .",
    "the completeness factor ( @xmath27 ) is larger than 80 % for @xmath28 in all the samples except the pc - int , the innermost one , where @xmath29 % for @xmath30 .",
    "it has been shown that the spatial variation of completeness within a single camera are negligible .",
    "for the present purpose , we take advantage of the great similarity of crowding conditions in the wf cameras of the int and ext samples to subdivide the total sample in the following subsamples : ( 1 ) pc - int , ( 2 ) wf - int , containing the wf2-int , wf3-int and wf4-int samples , ( 3 ) pc - ext and , ( 4 ) wf - ext , containing the wf2-ext , wf3-ext and wf4-ext samples .",
    "the four subsamples are internally very homogeneous and cover different radial regions of the cluster . in this sense ,",
    "the difference between the pc - ext and the wf - ext samples is small but we prefered to keep them separate because of the different limiting magnitude .",
    "the effects of the omf on the _ true _ properties of stars that may affect the lf derived from an observed sample are :    1 .",
    "* star loss .",
    "* stars may be lost in the observation / measure process .",
    "this occurs for two different reasons : 1 .   near the limiting magnitude of the observations",
    "a star can be succesfully detected if it falls on a positive fluctuation of the background that brings it _ above _ the detection threshold and can be _ lost _ if it falls on a _ negative _ fluctuation .",
    "this effect is purely stochastic ; it does not depend on the crowding .",
    "it just depends on the amplitude of the random fluctuations of the background .",
    "there is a level of magnitude beyond which no possible positive fluctuation can bring a star above the detection threshold .",
    "all the stars fainter than this limit are lost ( unobserved ) and just contribute to the diffuse luminosity of the unresolved background .",
    "2 .   stars may be lost if they fall on a brighter source ( star or galaxy ) and/or if their images are badly corrupted by defects of the chip or the hit of a cosmic ray ( this two latter effects are expected to have a negligible impact in the present case because of the adopted observation + data reduction strategy ; see pap  i ) .",
    "this effect depends on the local degree of crowding as well as on the magnitude of the star .",
    "* blending . *",
    "a star may be blended with a fainter source and its measured magnitude will be brighter than the _ true _ one because of the flux contributed by the fainter blended source .",
    "considered from the perspective of artificial stars experiments the maximum possible effect of a blending is to change the observed magnitude of a star by @xmath31 mag .",
    "in fact , if we recover an artificial star by its ( known ) position in a frame with an output magnitude more than @xmath32 mag brighter than its input magnitude , this means that it is fallen on a real star brighter than the simulated star .",
    "thus , we are not recovering / measuring the simulated star but the real one instead , i.e. , thus the artificial star has been lost .",
    "* observational scatter . *",
    "the magnitude of the _ true _ star is altered by all the sources of stocastic noise associated with the process of observation / data reduction ( e.g. , photon noise , imperfect psf fit , etc . ) .",
    "the maximum possible effect of this factor is magnitude dependent and may be roughly evaluated on the basis of the typical error on a given measure .",
    "for instance , in the present case we included in the final samples only the stars with errors lower than 0.2 mag in both @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "hence a @xmath33 fluctuation can change the magnitude of an observed star by @xmath34 mag , at most , near the limiting magnitude level .",
    "the derived lfs are in practice histograms of the number of stars as a function of magnitude . the factors above change the _ true _ lf histogram by depopulating the bins as a function of ( increasing ) magnitude ( mainly factor 1 ) and by moving stars from one bin to another ( migration ) due to the magnitude changes induced by factor 2 and/or 3",
    ". however factors 2 and 3 are strictly interwoven and their effect can not be separated .",
    "for example , a given star may be moved , say , 0.4 mag brighter because it is blended with a fainter unresolved source , but it might simultaneously be affected by a negative fluctuation of the random observational scatter , so its final magnitude may differ from the true one by just 0.2 mag . a blending between two unresolved sources can bring them above the detection threshold , injecting in the sample two stars that should have been lost if not blended .",
    "the possibilities are too numerous to list here .",
    "the real contribution of the three effects can not be known for a the specific case . on the other hand , it is clear that we can obtain a statistical knowledge of the actual lf .",
    "the traditional way to recover the _ true _",
    "lf from an observed one consists in multiplying the numbers in each bin of the observed lf by the inverse of the completeness factor ( @xmath35 ; where @xmath36 is the number of _ recovered _ stars and @xmath37 is the number of the _ simulated _ ones ) at the center of the bins .",
    "it is clear that such procedure corrects at first order only for the effects of star loss ( factor 1 ) while the effects of the other factors are ignored .",
    "a popular misconception is that the observational scatter can not produce bin migration if the width of the bin is larger than the typical error on the estimate of the magnitude .",
    "this is obviously not true since a star whose true magnitude is near the edge of a bin can migrate because of an arbitrarily small fluctuation .",
    "the effects of migration may be amplified by the completeness correction , especially in the faintest bins of the lf .",
    "furthermore the completeness factor may be obtained from the artificial star experiments _ only as a function of input magnitude _",
    "( say , @xmath38 ) while the observed lf is ( obviously ) a function of the _ observed magnitude _ , whose corresponding quantity in the artificial star experiment is @xmath39 ) of artificial stars corresponds to the _ true _ magnitude of real stars ( @xmath40 ) , while the output magnitude ( @xmath39 ) corresponds to the observed one ( @xmath41 ) under the extant conditions ] .",
    "thus when an observed lf is corrected by multiplying it by @xmath42 , it is implicitly assumed that @xmath38 and @xmath41 are the same quantity , that , in general , is not true .",
    "there have been few attempts to correct the observed lfs for all the effects above @xcite .",
    "the proposed methods require a complex mathematical approach , and may rely on the _ a priori _ assumption of an analytical form of the true lf @xcite or on approximate treatments of the propagation of errors under matrix inversions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for references and discussion ) .    here",
    "we propose a new method that is fully non - parametric and extremely simple in nature , taking also advantage of the huge enhancement in computational power of workstaions and pcs that took place since the times of the above quoted attempts .",
    "as we will show below ( _ a _ ) the proposed method takes full account of the effects of bin migration and ( _ b _ ) the completeness correction is consistently applied to a lf that is function of @xmath38 as the completeness factor .",
    "the method is particularly appropriate for the application to lfs of ssps , but it can be probably generalized to other cases .",
    "the prerequisite is the availability of huge sets of realistic artificial star experiments well sampling the whole spatial , luminosity , and color range of the observations .",
    "consider a large set of artificial star experiments performed in a region of uniform crowding conditions , e.g. , the wf2-ext set presented in fig .",
    "suppose that the input magnitudes of the artificial stars be distributed as the `` true '' stars of the parent population ( in this case the stars of ngc  288 ; the reasons of this hypothesis will become clear at the end ofthis section ) .",
    "from this set it is possible to extract a subsample of _ recovered _ stars with exactely the _ same dimension _ and the _ same distribution as a function of @xmath39 _ as the observed sample . call this subsample an _ equivalent sample _ ( es ) stars . from the artificial star",
    "set we extract at random @xmath43 stars whose _ output _ magnitudes lie in the _ i_-th bin . repeating this step for each bin of the observed lf",
    "we obtain a sample of recovered artificial star that have an _ output _",
    "lf equal to the _ observed _ one . note that the same procedure can be applied on a star - by - star basis , by randomly extracting an _ artificial sister _ ( see  3.4 ) for each _ observed _ star . ] .",
    "it is important to note that the es contains only stars that have been succesfully recovered in the artificial star experiments process , hence that have suffered only the effects of bin migration ( i.e , blending and/or observational scatter ) .    by definition",
    "the es has _ the same output ( e.g. , observed ) properties _ of the observed sample , it is one of the many possible relizations that are mapped by the omf from the input / true domain to the output / observed one .",
    "thus _ the input ( e.g. , true ) _ properties of the es are one of the possible _ true _ set of properties that may have been mapped into the observed sample by the omf .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the lf of the input magnitudes of the es is equivalent to the observed lf _ once corrected for all the effects of bin migration_. thus the identification of an es allows ( _ a _ ) the removal of all the effects of bin migration and ( _ b _ ) the expression of the observed lf as a function of input magnitude , consistently with the completeness factor ( see  3 . ) .",
    "if we apply the completeness correction to the _ input lf _ of the es we find one possible realization of the final lf , corrected for _ all the observational effects_. since different es may be mapped into the same observed sample by the omf , repeating the process for a number of ( randomly extracted ) different es and taking the average will allow to obtain a final lf more robust to random fluctuations as well as a direct estimate of the uncertainty associated with the whole process .    however , there is another important factor we have to take into account .",
    "while the completeness correction is completely independent from the distribution in magnitude of the artificial star set , the derived correction for bin migration is not .",
    "consider a given bin of the observed lf .",
    "such a bin will be primarily filled by stars with @xmath44 , but also by a certain fraction of stars which have migrated from the nearby bins beacause of blending and photometric errors . increasing the number of artificial stars in the nearby bins , with respect to the considered bin ,",
    "will enhance the probability of extracting stars that enter in the bin because of migration , hence increasing the final `` migration correction '' .",
    "the right correction would be obtained only if the artificial star set is distributed as the true lf of the population which is unknown , being the very target of our analysis .",
    "we circumvent this problem by iteratively adjusting ( _ a posteriori _ ) the distribution of the artificial star set until the best approximation is obtained ( see below for details ) .",
    "the approach has proven to be successful since we obtain the same final lf _ independently _ of the initial distribution of the artificial star set . in the following section the adopted operational procedure",
    "is described in detail .      for each of the four observed subsamples ( pc - int , wf - int , pc - ext , wf - ext ) we adopted the following procedure :    1 .",
    "an initial distribution of input magnitudes is assumed for the artificial stars and the largest possible subset accordingly distributed is extracted from the whole set of artificial stars .",
    "twenty different es are extracted at random from the above subset and their @xmath45 are corrected for completeness .",
    "the ( bin per bin ) average of the twenty obtained lfs is adopted as the `` current corrected lf '' and the standard deviation is adopted as the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "the `` current corrected lf '' is assumed as the distribution of the artificial stars and a new subset of artificial stars accordingly distributed is extracted from the whole set of artificial stars as in step 1 .",
    "the steps 2,3 and 4 are repeated twenty times . the twentieth `` current corrected lf '' is adopted as the _ final lf _ with the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "step 4 ensures that at each new iteration the adopted set of artificial stars will become more and more similar to the `` true '' one , giving increasingly appropriate rates of bin migration .    in all the cases considered here the process converged in @xmath46 iterations , e.g. ,",
    "the `` current corrected lfs '' become very stable after the sixth iteration .",
    "furthermore , the result is independent of the initial distribution of input magnitudes that is assumed for the artificial star subset .",
    "we have tried many different distributions ( some of which are shown in fig .  2 ) and in all cases the process converged to _ the same final lf _ in few iterations .",
    "some examples of the procedure are shown in fig .  2 , applyied to the wf - ext sample .",
    "in fig .  2a",
    "the artificial star subset was initially distributed as the observed lf down to @xmath47 and uniformly from this limit down to @xmath48 .",
    "a scaled version of the adopted distribution is plotted as a thick dotted line .",
    "the thin dotted histogram shows the `` current corrected lf '' after the first iteration of the process , the thin continuous histogram shows the `` current corrected lf '' after the sixth iteration and the open dots are the final lf , corresponding to the twentieth iteration of the process , with the currrent standard deviation of the twenty realizations of the corrected lfs as errorbars .",
    "the encircled dot is the first bin of the lf for which @xmath49 , i.e. the completeness correction is larger than a factor 2 . the fast convergence and the stability of the final solution can be readily appreciated .",
    "2b and 2c have the same symbols of fig .",
    "2a but shows the convergence of the process starting from ( very ) different initial distributions of the artificial star subset .",
    "the open dots are _ the same final lf shown in fig .",
    "2a_. thus fig .",
    "2a and 2b shows that the process converges to _ the same final lf _ independently of the assumed initial distributions of the artificial stars subset .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "2d shows in detail the results of the twentieth ( i.e. final ) iteration of the process shown in fig .",
    "the twenty histograms are the corrected lfs obtained by the twenty different es extracted from the finally adopted subset of artificial stars .",
    "the full dots and errorbars are their means and standard deviations .      since the obtained lfs are independent from the initial distribution of the adopted subset of artificial stars , we derived our final ( corrected ) lfs for all the considered samples assuming the same initial distribution of the artificial stars shown in fig .",
    "the final lfs are given in table  1 ( pc - int and wf - int samples ) and in table  2 ( pc - ext and wf - ext samples ) .",
    "the table gives the @xmath38 ( e.g. , @xmath40 ) of the center of the bins and , for each sample , the observed lf , the completeness factor @xmath27 , the final lf and the total error on the final lf ( see below ) .    the final lf is given down to the first bin that has @xmath50 . in the following plots",
    "this point is circled to serve as a reminder that it is has been derived applying a large correction .",
    "we retain these points as educated guesses of the behaviour of the lfs beyond the range in which moderate and safe corrections can be made .",
    "we consider as fully reliable only the points of the lf for which @xmath51 .",
    "we note that the last fully reliable points , according to the above criterium , have @xmath52 for the pc - int , wf - int , pc - ext , and wf - ext samples , respectively .",
    "thus the completeness is quite high for the whole considered range .",
    "the final total error reported in tab .",
    "1 and 2 has been obtained by summing in quadrature the error on the completeness factor ( estimated according to eq .",
    "18 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to the standard deviation of the twenty different realizations of the lf that are obtained in the last step of the procedure ( see  3.2 and fig .",
    "in all the following plots the errorbars associated with the lfs of ngc  288 represent this final total error .",
    "the final lfs ( open dots ) are shown with the corresponding observed lf ( full dots ) in fig .",
    "3 .    as a further check we compared our final lfs with those obtained by dividing the observed @xmath53 by @xmath54 .",
    "we note that the differences are within @xmath55 in most bins and @xmath56 in any bin .",
    "as expected , in this particular application the effects of bin migration are not large",
    ". this would not be the case if much more crowded fields were considered ( see  3 . and * ? ? ?",
    "there is an intrinsic kind of blending that can not be directly tackled with artificial star experiments .",
    "physical binary systems are strictly equivalent to chance superposition blendings .",
    "the lf for _ single stars _ can not be obtained if an independent estimate of the incidence of binary systems is not available .",
    "further , since the actual binary fraction ( @xmath2 ) depends on the ( unknown ) distribution of mass ratios ( @xmath57 ; see pap  i ) , any correction would be model dependent .",
    "indeed , a direct estimate of the impact of binary systems on the lf of a globular cluster has only been possible for ngc  6752 @xcite .",
    "now we can add a second cluster using the results of pap  i. we measured @xmath2 in the int and ext regions of ngc  288 .",
    "in the int region we found that the observations are compatible with 8%@xmath58 38% , and the most probable range is 10% @xmath59 20% . in the ext region",
    "@xmath60 10 % and the most probable value of @xmath2 is zero , independently of the assumed @xmath57 .",
    "thus , a sizeable fraction of binary systems is present in ngc  288 , at least in the int sample , and may affect the derived lf of single stars .    to quantify the effect we computed the mean bin - by - bin ratio between the lfs obtained by 5 es with @xmath61 % and by 5 es with @xmath62 % .",
    "this number gives ( approximately ) the fractional variation of the star content of the bins due to binary systems .",
    "furthermore , dividing the final lf by the quoted ratio , the lf is corrected for the binary content and mapped to the `` pure single stars '' case . in fig .",
    "4 the final lf of the wf - int sample not corrected for the binary content ( filled dots with error bars ) is compared with its binary - corrected versions in the assumption @xmath61 % and for three different @xmath57 ( see caption and pap  i for details ) .",
    "the comparison is performed in the magnitude range in which the binary estimate of pap  i has been performed ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "there are several noteworthy features in fig .  4 : 1 ) the maximum correction is @xmath64 3% .",
    "2 ) all the corrected lfs lie within the uncertainties of the un - corrected one .",
    "3 ) the plmr @xmath57 case is most similar to the uncorrected case .",
    "this was expected , since in this case the large majority of binary system has a very low mass secondary .",
    "this means that the migration of the primary is small , and that most of the secondary stars are so faint that they fall in an unobserved region of the lf .",
    "4 ) the correction for the phmr case depletes the intermediate bins ( @xmath65 ; because it corrects for the migration of primary ) and enhances the last bin because of the recovery of some secondary stars as single stars .",
    "5 ) no bin is exclusively depleted or enhanced by the redistribution of the binary components as single stars .    from the above results and discussion we conclude that :    1 .   the correction for binary systems",
    "can be safely neglected for the ext samples where the binary fraction is much lower than @xmath61 % and possibly null .",
    "the correction can be neglected also for the int samples , at least for @xmath66 , since it is smaller than the uncertainties of the final lf .",
    "however , it can not be excluded that the faintest bins of the single stars lf need a significant enhancement to take into account the effect of binaries , particularly if the actual @xmath57 favors high mass ratios .",
    "the case under study is particularly simple .",
    "ngc  288 is a very loose and relatively nearby cluster , so our wfpc2 observations well resolve the large majority of the stars down to the limiting magnitude of each subsample with a very high degree of completeness .",
    "further , the density gradient is a very fortuitous match to wfpc2 allowing a few large subsamples to nicely probe radial variations .",
    "it is important to note that the equivalent sample concept does not require such simplifications and may be successfully applied under any condition .",
    "if a strictly rigorous approach is adopted the es approach may have far reaching applications in the study of stellar populations . here",
    "we provide two possible examples to show the potential of the method .    * * extremely crowded field with strong density gradient*. the method can tackle with samples with arbitrarily large density gradient , for instance by subdividing the observed sample in subsamples whith nearly uniform stellar density ( as done in the present application ) .",
    "if the dimension of the observed sample is not sufficiently large to allow this approach , the es method can be implemented also on a star - by - star basis .",
    "it will suffice to assemble the ess by associating an artificial star analogue for _ each _ observed star , randomly extracted from a set of artificial stars having ( approximately ) the same @xmath39 and position in the frame of the considered observed star ( _ artificial sisters _ ) . the only basic requirement to successfully follow this approach is to have a very large set of artificial stars , sampling with large multiplicity the whole range of magnitudes and positions covered by the observed sample . * * mapping synthetic cmds into the observational plane*. the standard tool used to derive the star formation history ( sfh ) from the cmd of a resolved galaxy consist in the reproduction of observed cmd by a synthethic cmd in which the stars are extracted from theoretical evolutionary tracks ( see * ? ? ? * for references and discussion of the various adopted techniques ) . to transform the synthetic cmd to the observational plane the effects of incompleteness , blending and observational scatter must be added to the synthetic stars .",
    "this task is not easy and it is usually done with simplified approaches .",
    "for instance , the observational scatter is usually introduced by randomly extracting ` errors ' from gaussian distributions with standard deviations equal to the typical @xmath67 photometric error .",
    "however , the distribution of the observational scatter is not gaussian , in general , and it is not easy to parametrize .",
    "furthermore , the effects of blending are not separable from the effects of observational scatter , and gaussian distributions do not provide a good reproduction of the real distribution , introducing undesired noise in the comparisons .",
    "+ with the es approach , one can easily map the _ input magnitudes _ ( e.g. , `` true '' magnitudes ) extracted by the evolutionary track in to the observational plane with the correct omf , by `` asking '' to the artificial stars experiments what is the probabilty that such star would be successfully recovered or not .",
    "if a star passes the `` incompleteness barrier '' , it can be correctely mapped into the observational plane , for instance by assigning to it the output properties of an artificial analog extracted at random from a set of _ artificial sisters_. + in this way , the whole effects of the omf would be correctly reproduced without dangerous approximations and/or parametrizations .",
    "once the observed lfs have been corrected for all the observational effects and the impact of binary systems have been quantified , we can use the final lf to study the dynamical status of ngc  288 either comparing the lfs in the int and ext regions of the cluster , either comparing the lf of ngc  288 with those of other clusters . in the following we will normalize all the samples to be compared to the number of stars in the range @xmath68 , following the approach of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter pz99 ) .",
    "ngc  288 is not sufficiently nearby to allow a safe derivation of the lf down to the hydrogen burning limit even with hst . the comparison with other `` state of the art '' lfs of more nearby clusters ( see fig",
    ".  6 , below ) shows that such limit would occur a couple of magnitudes below our faintest valid point ( the faintest bin of the wf - ext lf ) . the mass - luminosity relation adopted in pap",
    "i indicates that the lowest mass efficiently sampled by our deepest lf is @xmath69 .",
    "usually mf are compared according to their slope in the plane @xmath70 for @xmath71 ( see pz99 and references therein ) .",
    "our best lf has just three points below this limit , thus the slope of the mf would be poorly constrained .",
    "because of this limitation we avoid any conversion of our lfs to mass functions ( mf ) , since that would necessarily be somewhat model dependent and uncertain ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "instead we will make direct comparisons between lfs in the allowed range .",
    "the lfs of the pc fields are identical ( to within the errors ) to those of the respective wf samples , in the range where the comparison is possible .",
    "since the wf samples are much larger and reach fainter magnitudes we will limit our analysis to these homogeneous datasets in the following .    in fig .  5 the lfs from the wf - int and the wf - ext samples are compared .",
    "it is evident at a first glance that the lf of the wf - int sample is flatter than that of wf - ext .",
    "given the adopted normalization , this is a clear indication of a depletion of low mass stars in the region within @xmath72 ( int ) with respect to the ext field . if the brightest bin is included in the normalization the effect is significantly enhanced .",
    "we note also that any correction for binaries would be much smaller than the observed difference ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "on the other hand , if fainter stars ( @xmath73 ) are used for normalization , one would infer a substantial excess of the more massive stars in the int sample .    independently of the assumed normalization",
    "it is worth establishing if the difference between the two lfs is statistically significant . to check this hypothesis we performed a @xmath74 test , adopting the appropriate definition of the statistic according to eq .",
    "14.3.3 by @xcite .",
    "the comparison has been performed in the safely comparable range @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting reduced @xmath74 is 2.31 with 12 degrees of freedom .",
    "the difference between the two lfs is found to be significant at the @xmath76 % confidence level , i.e. _ highly significant_.    we have already demonstrated that mass segregation exists in ngc  288 , since both binary systems and their by - product blue stragglers stars are also more centrally concentrated than the the single stars .",
    "although the evidence is not as strong ( because of the possible ambiguity in the interpretation associated with the choice of the normalization range ) , we feel that we now find some evidence for further mass segregation in the difference between the lfs of unevolved stars in the int and ext regions of the cluster .      in fig .",
    "6 the wf - int and the wf - ext lfs of ngc  288 are compared with the lfs of m10 , m22 and m55 by pz99 .",
    "the transformation from apparent to absolute magnitude has been obtained by assuming @xmath77 and @xmath78 , according to @xcite .",
    "the faintest point of the wf - ext lf reaches @xmath79 while the lf of the ( more nearby ) pz99 clusters reaches @xmath8013 .",
    "the faintest reported point appear to coincide with the turn - over point found in the lfs of the pz99 clusters , so this possible feature in the lf of ngc  288 is not detectable in our data ( but it have been apparently detected by * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pbd00 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the comparison in the range @xmath81 shows that the lf of ngc  288 is significantly flatter than those of m10 , m22 and m55 .",
    "note that the lfs of these clusters were obtained near the half - mass radius ( usually approximated with the half light radius @xmath82 , see * ? ? ?",
    "this is the region where the mass distribution of the cluster population is expected to be fairly representative of the ( present day ) global population ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since the int and ext sample are separated at 1 @xmath82 , the lf at the half - mass radius must be intermediate between the wf - int and the wf - ext , and the derived lfs should be representative of the global lf of ngc  288 .    the comparison presented in fig .",
    "6 strongly suggests that the global population of ngc  288 is significantly depleted of low mass stars with respect to m10 , m22 and m55 ( see pz99 for an indirect comparison with other clusters ) .    ngc  288 has a mass ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath84 that of the comparison clusters .",
    "its central density ranges from @xmath83 to @xmath85 @xcite that of the comparison clusters .",
    "thus ngc  288 is intrinsically less resistent to harrassment and heating by external forces .",
    "furthemore , among the clusters considered here , it moves on the orbit having the smallest perigalactic distance , the highest eccentricity and the highest inclination to the galactic plane .",
    "hence , it is expected to suffer strong bulge and disk shocks , and indeed may be one of the clusters with the highest disruption rates @xcite .",
    "the coupled effects of internal energy equipartition ( mass segregation ) , pushing the lighter stars to outer , shallowly bound orbits , and of the tidal field of the galaxy , removing the less bound stars venturing in the outer parts of the cluster halo , may well be at the origin of the depletion of lighter stars in ngc  288 .",
    "we regard this result as a reassuring confirmation of the theoretical predictions that account for the orbital characteristics of actual ggcs @xcite .",
    "recently , pbd00 presented a lf in the @xmath86 and @xmath87 near - infrared bands obtained with the hst nic3-nicmos camera ( parallel observations ) .",
    "the sample is small but reachs fainter magnitudes ( lighter masses ) than our data .",
    "pbd00 conclude that the mass function of ngc  288 is very similar to that of all other studied clusters , and that it shows no sign of the strong harrassment predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we regard the results ( and the conclusions ) of the present paper as more robust than those by pbd00 since : _ ( a ) _ the lf by pbd00 is based on a sample of 75 stars , a very small sample that may be subject to strong statistical fluctuations , and is not supported by artificial star experiments , while our lf is based on a sample of more than @xmath88 stars corrected for all the observational biases with the artificial star experiments ; and _ ( b ) _ the field observed by pbd00 is a small stamp ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 times smaller than the field observed here ) located at @xmath91 , far outside the region of our sample which is expected to be representative of the global cluster lf .",
    "the lf of the globular cluster ngc  288 ( down to @xmath92 ) has been obtained from a field covering a region comprised between the center of the cluster and @xmath93 .",
    "a new method to correct the observed lfs for all the observational effects have been introduced and applied .",
    "the method is based on the equivalent sample concept , which may have many interesting applications in the study of stellar populations .",
    "comparison of the lfs obtained in different regions of the clusters , indicates the presence of mass segregation within ngc  288 .",
    "independently of the assumed normalization the lfs of the inner ( wf - int ) and outer ( wf - ext ) sample turns out to be different at the @xmath76 % confidence level .",
    "the comparison with the lfs of other clusters strongly suggests that the global population of unevolved stars in ngc  288 is significantly depleted of low mass stars ( @xmath94@xmath95 ) , in general agreement with the predictions of recent theoretical predictions taking into account also the orbital properties of the cluster .",
