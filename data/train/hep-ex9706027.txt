    "leptoquarks are hypothetical exotic particles with both lepton and color quantum numbers ; they are color triplet bosons with fractional charge .",
    "they are produced in pairs at hadron colliders via strong interactions .",
    "a leptoquark will decay via an unknown coupling , @xmath0 , to a lepton and a quark .",
    "the production of leptoquark pairs in @xmath1 collisions is insensitive to @xmath0 , and we are not concerned with this coupling as long as it is greater than 10@xmath2 ; otherwise , the leptoquarks will not decay in our detector and escape detection .",
    "we assume that leptoquarks occur in generations ; this is to say that leptoquarks of one generation couple exclusively to leptons and quarks of the same generation .",
    "for example , a first generation leptoquark will only couple to electrons , electron neutrinos and u or d quarks . with this assumption of generations , we are able to bypass strict bounds ( @xmath3 1 tev ) on leptoquark masses derived from limits on flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "since leptoquarks are produced dominantly in pairs at hadron colliders , their signature would be two leptons plus two or more jets .",
    "a free parameter of the model for leptoquarks is the branching fraction of the leptoquark to charged lepton plus quark , @xmath4 . for @xmath5 , leptoquarks decay 100% to a charged lepton plus quark . in the case for a first generation leptoquark pair , the signature would be two isolated electrons ( @xmath6 ) plus at least two jets .",
    "additional jets could arise from initial state radiation or final state radiation .",
    "since we assume leptoquarks do not couple outside their own generation , for first generation leptoquarks , we would not expect to see muons or evidence of taus in the signature .",
    "some published and previous preliminary conference limits on leptoquarks masses are shown in tables  [ tab : one ] and [ tab : two ] . these give a brief history of mass limits from the tevatron .",
    "the previously published limits from cdf and 0 have used leading order ( lo ) theory .",
    "next leading order ( nlo ) theory predicts cross sections that are 30 - 50% higher than lo theory .",
    "nlo was used for the cdf limits at recent conferences  @xcite@xcite and will be used in the newest limits presented in this paper from 0 .",
    "0 searches for first generation leptoquarks primarily in the dielectron plus two jet and electron plus missing transverse energy ( ) plus two jet signatures corresponding to the decay modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the search for first generation leptoquarks in the dieletron plus two jet signature has been greatly modified since the 1997 moriond conferences  @xcite . after the announcement of the high mass events from hera  @xcite , 0 has retooled the analysis to increase the acceptance for leptoquarks by increasing the acceptance for electrons and by optimizing the event section for higher mass leptoquarks .",
    "the data sample used in this analysis is the full run i data sample of 123 pb@xmath9 .",
    "the single electron plus plus two jets signature search is also optimized at higher masses .",
    "we are also using the newly available nlo theory predictions  @xcite for the production cross section .    the electron identification for one of the two electrons in the dielectron search",
    "has been loosened to increase the acceptance for leptoquarks . for the loose selection ,",
    "the track requirement is removed .",
    "this has effectively doubled the acceptance for dielectrons .",
    "the relaxing of the track requirement for the one electron does not significantly increase the qcd background relative to the tight - tight electron selection .",
    "the basic @xmath10 event selection is given in the following list :    * two electrons with  @xmath11 20 gev with @xmath12 or @xmath13 , * two jets with  @xmath11 15 gev with @xmath14 where the jets are reconstructed with a cone algorithm using a cone of radius @xmath15 , * exclude events with dielectron invariant masses between 82 to 100 gev / c@xmath16 .",
    "the dielectron mass cut is a three sigma cut . with this basic selection , we have 101 events in our candidate sample .",
    "the main backgrounds come from drell - yan , qcd with jets faking electrons , and top .",
    "we estimate 66.8@xmath1713.4 events for drell - yan , 24.3@xmath173.6 events from qcd , and 1.8@xmath170.7 events from top for a total of 92.8@xmath1713.8 background events .",
    "further event selection is optimized for leptoquark masses of 200 gev / c@xmath16 and greater .",
    "the optimization is based on signal and background monte carlo event samples and on qcd data event samples .",
    "several variables have been studied for the optimization ; variables involving sums of energies and transverse energies ( ) of electrons and jets , variables of event shape , variables of reconstructed invariant masses , and variables involving constraints with leptoquark masses have been used .",
    "systematic grid search  @xcite and neural network  @xcite techniques are used for the optimization studies .",
    "we approached the optimization in two ways .",
    "the first is a discovery search where we optimized signal ( @xmath18 ) over the square root of the background ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 .",
    "the second is for setting a limit where we maximized the signal for a given target background of about 0.4 events .",
    "this level of background gives a probability of about 70% of seeing 0 background events .",
    "we find that a transverse energy variable defined as @xmath21 is the most optimal variable . here , the jets are required to have  @xmath11 15 gev to be included in the sum .",

    "each point in the plot represents a different set of cuts .",
    "the electron and jet s are fixed at the basic cut level as given in the figure",
    ". the upper line of dots are for the @xmath22 cut .",
    "the lower line of dots is for a leptoquark mass constrained variable defined as : dm / m(200 ) = @xmath23 . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the invariant masses of the two combinations of the electrons and jets such that the difference in the two masses is minimized , and @xmath26 is the mass of a 200 gev / c@xmath16 mass leptoquark in this example .",
    "the wide band of dots is the combination of both variables used in the selection . from this plot",
    "we see that that the @xmath22 variable does better than the mass constraint variable at our target background of 0.4 events .",
    "we find that a @xmath27 gev gives a background of about 0.4 events .",
    "none of the 101 candidate events pass this cut .",

    "[ fig : st1 ] and  [ fig : st2 ] .",
    "the background distribution matches well the data distribution .",
    "we have also studied the mass properties of the 101 dielectron candidate event sample .",
    "we used a 3c ( 3 constraint ) fit where we require balance of the transverse energy in the event and we require the masses of the two reconstructed electron - jet systems be equal .",
    "the combination of electron with jet is chosen such that the difference in masses is minimized before the fitting .",

    "one might note the two events at the high end of the mass distribution in fig .",

    "[ fig : st3c ] we see that the data and background prediction are again very similar .",
