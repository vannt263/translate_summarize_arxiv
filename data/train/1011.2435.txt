    "rhythmic behavior is present in almost all organisms .",
    "their rhythms can be autonomous , but are more often externally stimulated .",
    "one such stimulus is the 24-hour natural light - dark cycle which governs the activity - inactivity cycle of many animals and plants .",
    "the latter is the most common _ zeitgeber _ or periodic stimulus , although an alternating high - low temperature cycle is another example of a zeitgeber .",
    "shaped by several millions of years of evolution under this 24-hour light - dark cycle @xcite , many organisms still exhibit these behavioral rhythms ( often with slightly different period ) even in conditions without information on the alternation of light and darkness .",
    "how the almost-24-hour _ intrinsic period _ of the internal rhythm synchronizes with or entrains to an external zeitgeber is one of the major questions in circadian biology , see @xcite .    in mammals ,",
    "the circadian clock resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus , a neuronal hypothalamic tissue residing just above the optic chiasm .",
    "it consists of about 10000 interconnected neurons or pacer cells @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence seems to support the model of the suprachiasmatic nucleus as a collection of so called phase oscillators , which was put forward in 1980 to explain circadian rhythms @xcite .",
    "each oscillator has its own intrinsic period of activity - inactivity @xcite and interactions among them are believed to synchronize their oscillations @xcite .",
    "this model is used to explain the observation that the activity - inactivity cycle of an organism closely follows the period of a zeitgeber like the 24-hour light - dark cycle .    however , before trying to analyze a model for the collection of pacer cells , we consider a model for a single cell . a collection of interacting pacer cells may mathematically be modelled by a ( large ) number of coupled almost identical oscillators .",
    "such a model is rather involved , therefore we first make the following simplifying assumption . in our model",
    "each oscillator experiences the external ( averaged ) forcing by the collection of oscillators but does not influence the dynamics of the others .",
    "thus the coupling we consider is asymmetric .",
    "this approach is also widely used in astro - dynamics . the basis for our model of a single pacer cell",
    "is given in @xcite where the state of a pacer cell is determined by the phase in its activity - inactivity cycle .",
    "the stimulus of an external zeitgeber may advance or delay the phase depending on the phase itself but also on parameters characterizing the pacer cell .",
    "the parameters essentially consist of the intrinsic period of the pacer cell , the intrinsic length of the activity interval and the strength of the interaction with an external stimulus .",
    "the latter can be the relative number of active pacer cells in the environment as well as a stimulus originating from an external light , temperature , etc level . in our model",
    "the zeitgeber will be a periodic , quasi - periodic or even more general function of time .",
    "but in this article we restrict to a periodic zeitgeber where the period is an average or prevailing period in the natural light and dark cycle or in the collective behavior of pacer cells in the environment .",
    "models based on phase oscillators date back to at least 1967 , see @xcite , and have been studied by several others @xcite . for an overview",
    "see @xcite .",
    "thus we study a model of a single pacer cell , stimulated by its environment but not contributing to the collective behavior .",
    "for such a situation the main questions we wish to address are    1 .",
    "can a single pacer cell synchronize with or entrain to a periodic zeitgeber ? 2 .",
    "if so , how does this depend on properties of the pacer cell ?",
    "the mathematical model we use to describe a pacer cell stimulated by a periodic zeitgeber , is a dynamical system , more specifically a map on the circle .",
    "this map depends on the parameters characterizing the pacer cell .",
    "typical dynamics of a circle map most relevant in view of the questions above is dynamics of fixed points and dynamics of periodic points .",
    "fixed points correspond to _ entrainment _ of the pacer cell which means that the sequence of onset times of the activity interval has the same period as the zeitgeber .",
    "periodic points correspond to _ synchronization _ meaning that there are an integer number of @xmath0 different onset times of the activity interval during another integer number of @xmath1 periods of the zeitgeber .",
    "such points are called @xmath2 periodic points . in this vocabulary",
    "fixed points are @xmath3 periodic points , in other words entrainment is a special kind of synchronization .",
    "then the questions for the single pacer cell are translated into the following questions for the mathematical model .    1 .",
    "do stable fixed or periodic points exist for the map on the circle ? 2 .",
    "if so , for which domain in parameter space ?",
    "the analysis of the model for a single pacer cell shows that both entrainment and synchronization are possible . for weak interaction with the zeitgeber",
    "the parameter space is divided in regions with unique and distinct dynamics .",
    "when we fix all parameters except the intrinsic period of the cell and the strength of the interaction we get the so called arnold tongues , see figure [ fig : arnoldtongues ] .",
    "these are labelled by @xmath0 and @xmath1 such that for parameter values in the @xmath2 tongue , the dynamics of the map is @xmath2-periodic corresponding to synchronization of the pacer cell .",
    "this shows that for a fixed strength of interaction with the zeitgeber there are _ ranges of synchronization_. which means that for only a finite interval of values of the intrinsic period synchronization is possible . a phenomenon which is confirmed by biological experiments and observations ,",
    "see @xcite . as a remark we note that varying the intrinsic period at a fixed period of the zeitgeber is equivalent to varying the period of the zeitgeber while the intrinsic period is fixed .",
    "the largest range is the range of entrainment since the @xmath3 or main tongue is the largest .",
    "the location of the range of entrainment depends on the parameters governing phase advance and delay .",
    "in one extreme case only pacer cells with an intrinsic period smaller than the period of the zeitgeber can be entrained , in the other extreme case only pacer cells with a larger intrinsic period can be entrained .",
    "furthermore the onset time of the activity interval is an increasing function of the intrinsic period see section [ sec : matmodanl ] , which has been observed in many organisms , see @xcite .",
    "in our biological model of pacer cells , the state of each pacer cell is determined by a single variable : a phase @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "this phase is the resultant of many biochemical processes . in an isolated pacer cell",
    "the phase increases in time with speed one until it reaches a value @xmath5 , then it jumps to zero and starts to increase again .",
    "if the phase is between zero and a value @xmath6 the cell is active and between @xmath7 and @xmath5 , the cell is inactive .",
    "thus an isolated pacer cell shows a periodic activity - inactivity cycle with period @xmath5 .",
    "we call @xmath7 the length of the _ intrinsic activity interval _ and @xmath5 is called _ intrinsic period _ of the pacer cell .",
    "both the values of @xmath7 and @xmath5 are properties of the individual cell .    in a collection of pacer cells , considered as an organ without external stimulus ,",
    "the interaction among the cells is modelled as follows .",
    "let @xmath8 be the time at which the phase is zero .",
    "then the cell is active during the time interval @xmath8 to @xmath9 . at the end of this interval",
    "an isolated cell would become inactive but now the cell remains active until a later time namely @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fraction of active cells and @xmath12 is a small cell dependent parameter . we incorporate this _ phase delay _ into the model by once delaying the phase by an amount of @xmath13 at time @xmath9 , so instantly @xmath14 becomes @xmath15 .",
    "similarly the inactivity period of the cell is shortened by activity of other cells . if at time @xmath16 the phase of the cell is below @xmath5 by an amount of @xmath17 so that @xmath18 the cell becomes active again .",
    "thus there is a _ phase advance _ of @xmath14 by an amount of @xmath17 at time @xmath16 , that is instantly @xmath14 becomes @xmath19 .",
    "since the latter is equal to @xmath5 , by previous assumptions the phase jumps to zero .    before isolating a single pacer cell",
    "we note that in a collection of @xmath20 pacer cells the phase of cell @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 for cell @xmath21 depends on all phases @xmath23 except @xmath22 and possibly also on time @xmath24 , so @xmath25 , where the hat means @xmath22 excluded .",
    "however for reasons to be explained below , we will later on consider @xmath11 as a function of time only .    in a model with a large number of interacting pacer cells we assume that the interaction is uni - directional .",
    "that is the fraction of active cells stimulates a single cell , but the influence of a single cell on the collection is negligible .",
    "therefore the quantity @xmath11 can be considered as only time dependent @xmath26 .",
    "now our final model consists of a single pacer cell and we study its response to the external stimulus @xmath11 .",
    "the pacer cell is characterized by four parameters @xmath12 , @xmath27 , @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "we do not make a distinction whether @xmath11 is related to the fraction of active cells as a function of time or a daily light and dark signal . in our model",
    "@xmath11 is the _ zeitgeber _ for the cell and we will discuss several choices for it .    in principle the zeitgeber @xmath11 can be any function of time . here",
    "we will take it periodic , where the period is for example an average of the observed periods of the collection of pacer cells or an average period of an external stimulus like the daily light and dark cycle .",
    "but we may also take a much longer period to model seasonal effects .",
    "since pacer cells may have different values of @xmath12 , @xmath27 , @xmath7 and @xmath5 we are especially interested in the domain in parameter space where synchronization occurs .",
    "the system described in section [ sec : biomod ] has a state which evolves in time .",
    "this calls for a _ dynamical systems _ approach , as a general reference see @xcite .",
    "in order to do so we have to identify a _ state space _ and an _ evolution law_. this means that we should find one or more quantities describing the state of the system and then find an evolution law that uniquely defines a future state once an initial state is given .",
    "here we first restrict to _ deterministic dynamical systems _ that is we do not include noise or some other kind of random fluctuations .",
    "it will turn out that we can define a discrete dynamical system on the circle . using this model we are able to answer some of the questions in section [ sec : intro ] for a single pacer cell with a zeitgeber .    * an isolated pacer cell . *",
    "the model we build is based on the phase @xmath14 of the cell .",
    "first we consider the cell as a ` free running ' oscillator , depending on the two parameters @xmath7 and @xmath5 . later on",
    "we also include a periodic zeitgeber with two additional parameters @xmath12 and @xmath27 governing the strength of the forcing .",
    "let @xmath28 be the phase of the cell given by @xmath29 where @xmath5 is the maximal value of @xmath14 . when @xmath14 reaches the value @xmath7 , with @xmath30 , the cell undergoes the transition from active to inactive .",
    "suppose at @xmath31 the phase @xmath14 is zero .",
    "the phase increases with speed @xmath32 until it reaches the maximal value @xmath5 , then @xmath14 instantly becomes zero again .",
    "this happens at time @xmath33 .",
    "thus the period of the ` free running ' oscillator is @xmath5 .",
    "the transition times are @xmath34 and @xmath9 where the cell state changes from inactive to active and from active to inactive respectively , see figure [ fig : theta ] .",

    "the reason is that there are curves of period doublings in the @xmath152-parameter plane with local minima , considered as functions of @xmath5 , that are transversally crossed . for more details",
    "we refer again to @xcite .",
    "an example of this phenomenon is shown in figure [ fig : pdh ] .",
    "( 100,50)(0,0 ) ( 5,5 ) with zeitgeber @xmath233 .",
    "shown are the positions of periodic points as a function of the intrinsic period @xmath5 .",

    "the main point we have to show is that equation can be solved uniquely with respect to @xmath24 . using the expression for @xmath14 in we obtain after some rearranging @xmath239 since @xmath11 is @xmath32-periodic",
    ", @xmath80 has the property @xmath240 , for all @xmath24 .",
    "then the equation for @xmath16 reads @xmath241 introducing the operator @xmath242 which takes a function @xmath243 into @xmath244 where @xmath245 is just translation over @xmath7 , that is @xmath246 we can write the equation for @xmath16 as @xmath247 solvability of depends on the value of @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath27 is small enough , @xmath79 is invertible and we write @xmath248 then @xmath61 is a differentiable map with the property @xmath62 , which means that @xmath61 is the _ lift _ of a _ circle map _ of degree one .",

    "a consequence of @xmath62 is that @xmath249 is 1-periodic , thus there is a 1-periodic @xmath250 function @xmath251 such that @xmath252 .",
    "@xmath251 has a fourier series so we may split off the constant term and we write @xmath253 with @xmath254 , then @xmath88 is a @xmath250 function of @xmath137 . furthermore @xmath255 so that @xmath256 is a 1-periodic @xmath250 function with @xmath257 .",

    "finally @xmath264 .",
    "recall that @xmath60 and @xmath212 with @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "then for small @xmath196 and assuming that @xmath265 we get @xmath266 the zeitgeber @xmath11 has the following fourier series @xmath267 .",
    "after a near identity transformation followed by a time shift we obtain that @xmath157 is equivalent to @xmath268 it almost immediately follows that the boundaries of the main tongue of @xmath269 and thus of @xmath102 are as stated in the lemma .",
    "the number of fixed points may change if the number of solution branches of equation : @xmath270 changes .",
    "this is equivalent to a changing number of extrema of @xmath271 . using @xmath67 we get @xmath272 .",
    "thus the number of extrema of @xmath5 changes at parameter values for which @xmath273 this equation has trivial solutions for @xmath12 and @xmath27 only if @xmath274 .",
    "we rewrite this as @xmath275 this inequality holds if @xmath276 is injective .",
    "therefore a sufficient condition is that @xmath277 does not change sign . from @xmath278",

    "<S> almost all organisms show some kind of time periodicity in their behavior . especially in mammals the neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus form a biological clock regulating the activity - inactivity cycle of the animal . </S>",

    "<S> we consider each neuron as a so called phase oscillator , coupled to other neurons for which the light - dark cycle is a zeitgeber . to simplify the model we first take an externally stimulated single phase oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the first part of the phase interval is called the active state and the remaining part is the inactive state . without external stimulus </S>",
    "<S> the oscillator oscillates with its intrinsic period . </S>",
    "<S> an external stimulus , be it from activity of neighboring cells or the periodic daylight cycle , acts twofold , it may delay the change form active to inactive and it may advance the return to the active state . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of delay and advance depends on the strength of the stimulus . </S>",
    "<S> we use a circle map as a mathematical model for this system . </S>",
