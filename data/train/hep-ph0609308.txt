    "the good - and - walker picture  @xcite of diffraction was originally meant to describe soft diffraction .",
    "they express an hadronic projectile @xmath1 in terms of hypothetic eigenstates of the interaction with the target @xmath2 that can only scatter elastically : @xmath3 the total , elastic and diffractive cross - sections are then easily obtained : @xmath4 ^ 2\\hspace{0.5 cm } \\sigma_{diff}=\\sum_n c_n^2 t_n^2\\ .\\label{gaw}\\ ] ]    it turns out that in the high energy limit , there exists a basis of eigenstates of the large@xmath5 qcd @xmath6matrix : sets of quark - antiquark color dipoles @xmath7 caracterized by their transverse sizes @xmath8 in the context of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , we also know the coefficients @xmath9 to express the virtual photon in the dipole basis . for instance , the equivalent of @xmath10 for the one - dipole state is the well - known photon wavefunction @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the virtuality of the photon .",
    "this realization of the good - and - walker picture allows to write down exact ( within the high - energy and large@xmath5 limits ) factorization formulae  @xcite for the total , elastic and diffractive cross - sections in dis .",
    "they are expressed in terms of elastic scattering amplitudes of dipoles off the target proton @xmath13 where the average @xmath14 is an average over the proton wavefunction that gives the energy dependence to the cross - sections ( @xmath15 is the rapidity ) .",
    "formulae are similar to ( [ gaw ] ) with extra integrations over the dipoles transverse coordinates .",
    "for instance , denoting the total rapidity @xmath16 and the minimal rapidity gap @xmath17 the diffractive cross - section reads  @xcite @xmath18 this factorization is represented in fig.1 .",
    "besides the @xmath12 dependence , the probabilities to express the virtual photon in the dipole basis @xmath19 also depend on @xmath20 starting with the initial condition @xmath21 the probabilities can be obtained from the high - energy qcd rapidity evolution .",
    "finally , the scattering amplitude of the n - dipole state @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the scattering amplitude of the one - dipole state .",
    "we are therefore led to study the rapidity evolution of objects such as @xmath25",
    "within the high - energy and large@xmath5 limits , the dipole amplitudes are obtained from the pomeron - loop equation  @xcite ( see fig.2 ) derived in the leading logarithmic approximation in qcd ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this is a langevin equation which exhibits the stochastic nature  @xcite of high - energy scattering processes in qcd ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "its solution is an event - by - event dipole scattering amplitude function of @xmath26 and @xmath16 ( @xmath27 is a scale provided by the initial condition ) .",
    "it is characterized by a saturation scale @xmath28 which is a random variable whose logarithm is distributed according to a gaussian probability law  @xcite .",
    "the average value is @xmath29 and the variance is @xmath30 ( see fig.3 , left plot ) .",
    "the dispersion coefficient @xmath31 allows to distinguish between two energy regimes : the geometric scaling regime ( @xmath32 ) and diffusive scaling regime ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the following results for the averaged amplitude will be needed to derive the implications for inclusive and diffractive dis : @xmath34 all the scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of @xmath35 the amplitude for a single dipole which features the following scaling behaviors : @xmath36 in the saturation region @xmath37 @xmath38 as the dipole size @xmath39 decreases , @xmath40 decreases towards the weak - scattering regime , following the scaling laws ( [ gs ] ) or ( [ ds ] ) , depending on the value of @xmath41 ( see fig.3 , right plot ) . in the geometric scaling regime ( @xmath32 ) , the dispersion of the events is negligible and the averaged amplitude obeys ( [ gs ] ) . in the diffusive scaling regime ( @xmath33 ) , the dispersion of the events is important , resulting in the behavior ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "= 4.5 cm    = 4.3 cm",
    "we shall concentrate on the diffusive scaling regime , in which the dipole scattering amplitude can be written as follows  @xcite for @xmath42 @xmath43 from this , one obtains the following analytic estimates @xcite for the @xmath44 total cross - section in dis and for the diffractive cross - section integrated over the rapidity gap size ( at fixed @xmath45 ) from @xmath46 to @xmath47 @xmath48 the variable @xmath49 is reminiscent of the scaling variable of the dipole amplitude : @xmath50 it shows that in the diffusive scaling regime , both inclusive and diffractive scattering are dominated by small dipole sizes @xmath51 also the cross - sections do not feature any pomeron - like ( power - law type ) increase with the energy and the diffractive cross - section ( which does not depend on @xmath52 ) is dominated by the scattering of the quark - antiquark ( @xmath53 ) component , corresponding to rapidity gaps close to @xmath54 these features a priori expected in the saturation regime ( @xmath55 ) are valid up to values of @xmath12 much bigger than @xmath56 in the whole diffusive scaling regime for @xmath57 ( see fig.4 ) .    the inclusive cross - section and the @xmath53 contribution to the diffractive cross - section",
    "are obtained from the dipole amplitude @xmath58 in the following way : @xmath59 in order to better exhibit the dominance of small dipole sizes @xmath60 , we represent in fig.5 the integrands of ( [ dis ] ) and ( [ ddis ] ) as a function of the dipole size @xmath61 keeping @xmath62 fixed , we use ( [ erfc ] ) in the diffusive scaling regime and @xmath63 in the geometric scaling regime .",
    "the difference between the two regimes is striking . in the geometric scaling regime ,",
    "the total cross - section is dominated by semi - hard sizes ( @xmath64 ) while the diffractive cross - section is dominated by inverse dipole sizes of the order of the hardest infrared cutoff in the problem : the average saturation scale @xmath65 in the diffusive scaling regime , both inclusive and diffractive scattering are dominated by inverse dipole sizes of the order of the hardest infrared cutoff in the problem : the hardest fluctuation of the saturation scale , which is as large as @xmath66    in the diffusive scaling regime , up to values of @xmath12 much bigger than the saturation scale @xmath67 , cross - sections are dominated by rare events in which the photon hits a black spot that he sees at saturation at the scale @xmath68 in average the scattering is weak , but saturation is the only relevant physics .",
    "the work described here was done in collaboration with yoshitaka hatta , edmond iancu , grgory soyez and dionysis triantafyllopoulos .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers and especially michal praszalowicz for giving me the opportunity to present this work at the school ."
