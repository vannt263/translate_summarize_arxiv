    "the sn2011fe was discovered in m101 by the transient palomar factory on august 24 , 2011 , and classified as a normal type ia @xcite .",
    "the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) has collected 190 @xmath17 , 4143 @xmath18 , and 252 @xmath19 magnitudes until november 10 , 2011 , from 48 different sources .",
    "they establish the exceptionally well defined light curves shown in figure  [ fig:01 ] .",
    "overplotted are the well fitting standard light curves in @xmath17 and @xmath18 for sneia with a decline rate of @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "the intrinsic colors in function of @xmath35 are derived from 34 unreddened sneia in e / s0 galaxies and outlying sneia in spirals ( @xcite ) .",
    "the color @xmath36 35 days after @xmath17 maximum was also used as a fiducial reference point following @xcite and others .",
    "the excesses @xmath37 and @xmath38 are converted into values of @xmath39 using empirical relations for sneia from @xcite .",
    "the resulting mean value is @xmath40 .",
    "this is so close to zero that it is assumed that sn2011fe suffers no absorption within m101 .",
    "note that any absorption could make the intrinsic luminosity of sn2011fe only brighter .",
    "@xmath41 occurred @xmath42days after @xmath43 as compared with a 3-day delay given by @xcite .",
    "the sn peaked in @xmath19 3.7 days before @xmath43 .",
    "the secondary peak of the light curve in @xmath19 at @xmath44 came 31.6 days after the primary maximum .    since sn2011fe has the fiducial decline rate of @xmath45 and since it is affected by minimum internal absorption , the corrected magnitudes @xmath46 are the same as the observed magnitudes ( after correction for galactic absorption ) .",
    "this makes sn2011fe a particularly valuable luminosity calibrator because it minimizes errors introduced by absorption corrections and the homogenization to @xmath45 .",
    "[ [ sec:3 ] ]    the trgb of m101 has been detected in an outlying field at @xmath47 @xcite . @xcite",
    "found @xmath48 .",
    "( the magnitudes are corrected throughout for galactic absorption following @xcite ) .",
    "the mean value of @xmath49 gives together with the calibration from above a true distance modulus of m101 of @xmath0 , which we adopt .",
    "@xcite have suggested @xmath50 to lie at @xmath51 for a reference color of @xmath14 , yet the magnitude is clearly too bright .",
    "the value is measured in two inner fields of m101 .",
    "the authors have taken the precaution to exclude the stars within @xmath52 from the center , but in spite of this the field contains a mixture of old and young stars .",
    "some of the latter are very bright and red and hide the true trgb .",
    "the authors edge detection function shows a weaker maximum at @xmath53 which could be the signature of the true trgb in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several similar cases are known .",
    "already @xcite have shown in case of ngc3621 that the trgb is unambiguously detected in halo fields , whereas an inner field contains so many equally red , but brighter stars that the trgb becomes undetectable .",
    "a good illustration is also provided by ngc4038 , where @xcite , considering a field containing clear tracers of a young population , suggested a trgb magnitude that is @xmath54 brighter than the convincing trgb found by @xcite in another field of this galaxy that does not show evidence for a young population .",
    "we suspect that also the claimed trgbs of ngc3368 at @xmath55 @xcite and ngc3627 at @xmath56 @xcite are determined by very red and luminous stars of a younger population .",
    "the two galaxies are considered to be bona fide members of the leo  i group where four other members have a mean trgb magnitude about @xmath57 brighter ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "also their implied trgb distances of @xmath59 and 29.82 are smaller by @xmath60 than their respective cepheid distances of 30.34 and 30.50 @xcite .",
    "finally the sneia 1998bu in ngc3368 and 1989b in ngc3627 would become fainter by @xmath61 with the proposed trgb distances than sn2011fe in m101 .",
    "considering the luminosity dispersion of sneia of only @xmath9 , this corresponds to a @xmath62 discrepancy .    for the reasons given we discard the inner - field trgb detection of m101 by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately cepheids can not be used to buttress the trgb distance of m101 , although , in general , cepheid and trgb moduli agree to within @xmath15 on average with a dispersion of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the problem of m101 is that the cepheids in an outer , metal - poor field @xcite and in two inner , metal - rich fields @xcite yield discordant distances .",
    "a recent discussion of these cepheids gives @xmath64 for the outer field ( in acceptable agreement with the trgb distance ) and @xmath65 ( statistical error ) for the inner fields @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy of @xmath66 is not due to the specific choice of the period ",
    "p - l ) relation , but is confirmed by several authors using different p - l relations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their table  3 ) .",
    "sixty - two sneia with @xmath67 define a hubble relation of the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "these values are the intercepts of the respective hubble lines for an adopted @xmath72cdm model with @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xcite , eq .",
    "26 ) .    the corrected apparent maximum magnitudes of sn2011fe in table  [ tab:01 ] give together with the trgb modulus of m101 from section  [ sec:3 ] the absolute magnitudes @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "these values inserted into equation  ( [ eq:01 ] ) give large - scale values of @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the weighted mean value is @xmath81 .",
    "in view of the internal luminosity dispersion of sneia of @xmath9 we adopt a large statistical error of @xmath82 from m101 and its snia alone .",
    "the systematic error is negligible in comparison .",
    "there are four additional sneia with direct or circumstantial trgb distances .",
    "they are compiled in table  [ tab:02 ] together with sn2011fe .",

    "the sn is in addition a slow decliner and requires a relatively large @xmath35 correction .",
    "sneia 1989b and 1998bu have large corrections for internal absorption ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "moreover , the trgb distances of their host galaxies , ngc3627 and 3368 , have been rejected in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "instead it is assumed that they are genuine members of the leo  i group whose mean distance of @xmath103 is secure from four other group members with good trgb magnitudes .",
    "these galaxies are ngc3351 , 3377 , 3379 , and 3384 with trgb determinations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the group membership is particularly compelling for ngc3368 ( m96 ) which lies between the two trgb galaxies ngc3351 ( m95 ) and ngc3379 ( m105 ) .",
    "the mean value of @xmath85 in table  [ tab:02 ] is remarkably stable .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath104 agrees with what one expects from distant sneia .",
    "the weighted mean is @xmath105 , the unweighted mean is only @xmath106 fainter , as is the mean if sn2011fe is omitted . if one suspects sn1937c because of its old , yet modernized photometry and if one excludes sne 1938bu and 1989b because their trgb distances depend on group membership , the remaining two sn2011fe and sn1972e give @xmath107 .",
    "the gain of the overall mean over the determination from only sn2011fe is that the statistical error is now much reduced .",
    "we adopt the above weighted mean luminosity of the five sneia that , inserted in equation  ( [ eq:01 ] ) , gives @xmath108 the systematic error depends now mainly on the assumption that ngc3627 and 3368 do _ not _ lie at their suggested trgb distances , but that they are actual members of the leo  i group . for the additional reasons given in section  [ sec:3 ] we are convinced that the attribution is correct within the ( small ) depth effect of the group .",
    "we therefore estimate the systematic error to be not more than 5% .    for comparison",
    "it is noted that the trgb distances of 78 field galaxies with @xmath109 ( @xmath110 is the velocity corrected for a local virgocentric infall vector of @xmath111 ) give a local value of @xmath112 ( @xcite ) . a slightly augmented sample of @xcite , comprising now 29 cepheid distances with @xmath113 , yields @xmath114 ( @xcite ) . twenty cepheid - calibrated sneia with @xmath115 lead to a still quite local value of @xmath116 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a large - scale value comes from the summary paper of the _ hst _ supernova project , based on ten sneia with cepheid distances and a total of 62 sneia with @xmath117 , that resulted in @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "population  i and population  ii distance indicators point here consistently to a value of @xmath119 .",
    "however other authors have found @xmath120 from a different  as we believe inadequate  treatment of the period - color and period - luminosity relations of cepheids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this illustrates the importance of an independent distance scale based on population  ii objects only .",
    "additional support for a rather low value of @xmath7 comes from @xcite who have derived , by combining the catalog of luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) from the sloan digital sky survey dr7 with the 5-year wmap data and the hubble diagram of the snia union sample , a value of @xmath121 on the assumption of a @xmath72cdm model .",
    "the importance of the rr  lyr star - calibrated trgb is that it uses exclusively population  ii objects and provides an independent check on the population  i cepheid distance scale .",
    "the determination of cepheid distances is time - consuming and complex .",
    "the metallicity dependence of their colors makes the determination of internal absorption uncertain and implies also that their period - luminosity relation changes with metallicity @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the general agreement , already cited , of cepheid and trgb distances , the discrepancies of the cepheid distances of the two galaxies , where these variables were observed in two separate fields , viz .",
    "m101 ( see section  [ sec:3 ] ) and even more pronounced in case of ngc4258 @xcite , are unexplained . alarming are also the cepheids in ngc1309 by @xcite whose observed @xmath122 color  uncorrected for internal reddening  is _ bluer _ by @xmath123 on average than that of any other long - period cepheids @xcite .",
    "also the cepheids of ngc3021 @xcite are very blue .",
    "other blue cepheids may be concealed by internal reddening .",
    "the properties of blue cepheids must be influenced by one or more hidden parameters , as for instance the helium content .",
    "since the luminosity of these cepheids is unknown , they can not be used for a distance determination .",
    "the difficulties with some cepheids illustrate the need for an independent confirmation of the large - scale distance scale . the test can be provided by trgb distances which carry the distance scale",
    " if used for the luminosity calibration of sneia  to the limit where sneia can be observed .",
    "the present result will be much improved by future trgb distances of galaxies that have produced a sneia .",
    "it is desirable that the search for the trgb in ngc3368 and 3627 in the leo  i group will be repeated in some uncontaminated halo fields .",
    "the next easiest targets at present are the virgo cluster galaxies ngc4526 with sn1994d and ngc4639 with sn1990n .",
    "slightly more difficult are the fornax cluster galaxies ngc1316 with three ( ! ) sneia ( 1980n , 1981d , and 2006dd ) and ngc1380 with sn1992a .",
    "these sne , except sn1981d , are blue and hence little affected by internal absorption .",
    "the virgo and fornax galaxies will be rather nearer than ngc4038 where @xcite have demonstrated that the trgb can be reached .",
