    "at all redshifts from @xmath12 to @xmath13 a fraction of galaxies can be detected in the lyman alpha line of hydrogen ( e.g. cowie and hu 1998 ; deharveng et al .",
    "2008 ; hu et al .  2010",
    "; ouchi et al .  2010 ; vanzella et al .",
    "the ly@xmath1 line is easily detected in narrow - band imaging or blind spectroscopic surveys , and ly@xmath1  emission - line searches have been widely used to find high redshift galaxies .",
    "in addition , for the highest redshift galaxies , this line is the only spectroscopic signature that can be used to confirm the redshift of a galaxy selected on the basis of color properties .",
    "however , ly@xmath1 is a difficult line to interpret .",
    "because the line is resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , determining its escape path and therefore its dust destruction is an extremely complex problem both theoretically ( e.g. , neufeld 1991 ; finkelstein et al .",
    "2007 ) and observationally ( e.g. , kunth et al .  2003 ; schaerer & verhamme 2008 , stlin et al .  2009 ) .",
    "it is therefore critical to determine the ultraviolet continuum properties of the ly@xmath1  emitting galaxies ( laes ) in order to understand how to interpret them in terms of physical quantities such as the star - formation rate and to relate them to uv - continuum selected samples at the same redshift ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2010 ) .    extending this measurement to the highest redshifts possible",
    "is of considerable interest because the laes may be used as probes of the structure of the intergalactic gas at @xmath14 ( e.g. , dijkstra & wyithe 2010 , tilvi et al .",
    "2010 , dayal et al .",
    "2011 , laursen et al .",
    "since ly@xmath1  photons resonantly scatter off of neutral hydrogen , the ly@xmath1  emission from galaxies scatters from the line of sight as it propagates through the intergalactic medium ( e.g. loeb & rybicki 1999 ; zheng et al .  2010 ) potentially reducing the strength of the observed ly@xmath1 .",
    "thus the frequency of ly@xmath1  emitters relative to the uv continuum - selected galaxy population is potentially a function of the degree of ionization of the intergalactic medium and could be used to probe the epoch of reionization of the universe , at redshift @xmath15 ( e.g. stark et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) .    here",
    "we extend the measurement of the uv - continuum properties of the laes to @xmath0 , the highest redshift where substantial samples of these objects exist , using very deep near - infrared continuum observations of a uniform sample of @xmath0  laes obtained with the wfc3 camera on hst .",
    "these are the first observations deep enough to measure individual continuum magnitudes at this redshift for all the objects in this population and we find that their uv - continuum properties and the fraction of ly@xmath1 emitters relative to uv - continuum selected samples are very similar to that seen at lower redshift .",
    "the observations show no indication that the onset of reionization is at @xmath0 .",
    "we obtained @xmath16  ( rest frame @xmath17 ) continuum detections for a sample of 7 ly@xmath1  emitters ( laes ) at @xmath0   in a 600  arcmin@xmath18   region centered on the massive @xmath19 galaxy cluster abell 370 .",
    "the sample was drawn from hu et al.s ( 2010 ) ly@xmath1 spectroscopic atlas of 88 @xmath20 and 30 @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the hu et al .",
    "ly@xmath1  emitters were chosen based on their narrow - band excess and their broad - band colors in very deep images obtained with the suprime camera on the subaru  8 m telescope . they were then spectroscopically confirmed using the deimos spectrograph on the keck  10 m telescope .",
    "they form a sample of objects with ly@xmath1 rest frame equivalent widths above 20  and log(l(l@xmath1))@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 in the selected redshift interval .",
    "these objects have narrow ly@xmath1  emission lines ( velocity widths 150  300  @xmath21 ) and , as we shall show below , while they are small , they are marginally spatially extended in the present observations .",
    "we therefore assume that they are powered by star formation and not by an active galactic nucleus .",
    "we used the wfc3 camera on @xmath22  with the f140w filter to obtain @xmath23 observations of all of the @xmath0 objects in the a370 field of that survey .",
    "each of the @xmath0  galaxies was observed for 2 orbits using the f140w filter of the wfc3 camera on hst ( mackenty et al .",
    "a four point dither pattern was used and repeated 3 times , giving a total exposure time of 4235s for each field .",
    "we used the combined drizzled images together with the calibration produced by the hst pipeline , but then removed a further background determined from the median average of the fields .",
    "the measured fwhm for faint stars in the images is 0.22 arcseconds . as we shall discuss below",
    ", the galaxies are small so , given the high spatial resolution of the hst images , we used @xmath24  diameter magnitudes and corrected these to approximate total magnitudes using an offset of 0.15 magnitudes computed from the enclosed energy curves of the instrument .",
    "we measured the noise in the images by measuring the fluxes in random blank sky positions and found a @xmath25  noise level of 28.75 for the corrected @xmath24  diameter magnitudes .",
    ", width=288 ]    all of the galaxies in the sample were detected ; a typical example is shown in figure  [ typical_image ] .",
    "the faintness of the image , even in a very deep z band exposure such as that shown ( @xmath26  ab ) , illustrates the difficulty of making accurate continuum measuruments from the ground .",
    "the observed continuum magnitudes and other quantities are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the first detected @xmath0 galaxy , hcm6a ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ) , is a member of the sample and since this galaxy lies in the strong - lensing region of a370 , for this object we also give the values corrected for lensing amplification ( quantities in parentheses in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",

    "the @xmath20 sample has identical median and mean values of 0.07 for the ly@xmath1  to uv continuum luminosity ratio , while the @xmath8  sample has a median value of 0.05 and a mean value of 0.08 .",

    "[ lplot ] , width=336 ]    the high value of the ly@xmath1   to uv continuum ratio is likely to be , at least in part , a selection effect : if there is a range in the amount of destruction of ly@xmath1  relative to the continuum , then the most luminous ly@xmath1 emitters will be those with the least destruction , which may then have near - standard ratios .",
    "in particular , objects without ly@xmath1  detections at the rest - frame ew limit of @xmath68  should not be analyzed with this result , which holds only for objects in the lae samples .",
    "however , the result does imply that many objects with little ly@xmath1  destruction do exist and that , for these luminous ly@xmath1-selected objects , we can convert between ly@xmath1 and uv continuum luminosities . at first sight",
    "this may seem inconsistent with the blue asymmetric profiles seen in these ly@xmath1  emitters ( hu et al .",
    "however , these profiles may be intrinsic to the galaxy and produced by scattering in outflows ( verhamme et al .",
    "2006 ) rather than being a consequence of ly@xmath1  scattering in the surrounding intergalactic gas .",
    "our measured ratio of ly@xmath1  luminosity to uv continuum luminosity can be combined with the ` conventional ' kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation between the star formation rate and the uv luminosity to obtain @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is in erg s@xmath3  and , again , the value is for a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "the effects of metallicity may change this relation by as much as 0.2 dex ( schaerer & verhamme 2008 ) and it is also dependent on the exact star formation history .",
    "however , it can be seen from the ly@xmath1  luminosities in table  [ tab1 ] that typical star formation rates , with no extinction correction , are in the range of 510 m@xmath71 yr@xmath3 , where we have used the relationship above in computing the sfrs .",

    "( 2010 ) we constructed continuum luminosity functions of the ly@xmath1-selected sample at both @xmath20 and @xmath0 , using the accessible volumes computed for each object in hu et al .",
    "we converted ly@xmath1 luminosity to a uv continuum luminosity at 1350  ( rest - frame ) using the constant star - formation value of 0.065 for the ratio of ly@xmath1  luminosity to uv continuum light redward of ly@xmath1 , and assuming the continuua are roughly constant in @xmath64 from 1350  to 1850 .",
    "these luminosity functions are shown in figure  [ mab_funs ] , where we compare them with continuum luminosity functions determined from color - selected samples ( ouchi et al .",

    "both of these results may be due in part to the extreme difficulty of measuring accurate continuum magnitudes from ground - based data , particularly when the ly@xmath1  lines lie within the continuum bandpass .",
    "however , the difference is also due in part to the high ly@xmath1   luminosity functions calculated in these papers , which are about a factor of two above that of hu et al .",
    "hu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argue that the difference between their ly@xmath1  lf and the previous determinations is a consequence of using a fully spectroscopically confirmed sample which eliminates some of the photometrically selected objects but kashikawa et al .",

    "( 2011 ) ly@xmath1  lf would result in a very large fraction of uv continuum - selected galaxies having ly@xmath1  emission at near the case b ratio .",
    "this would be a rather surprising result , given that we expect at least some destruction owing to scattering in the igm .",
    "we can also use the luminosity functions to estimate the fraction of uv continuum sources that have strong ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "this fraction rises rapidly at low redshifts ( from 5% at @xmath12  to @xmath76% at @xmath77 ; cowie , barger & hu 2010 ) but above @xmath77  it has been less clear whether it continues to increase or drops again ( stark et al .  2010 , 2011 ; zucca et al .  2009 ;",
