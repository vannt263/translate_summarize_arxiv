    "mobile data traffic is predicted to grow by 800% in the next 6 years @xcite .",
    "this imposes a severe strain on existing wireless networks .",
    "one of the most promising methods to reduce downlink traffic is to store content closer to end users , commonly referred to as _ caching _ @xcite .",
    "caching has been studied extensively in recent years . in @xcite , a central server with access to a file library",
    "serves a number of users , each with the ability to cache content , using a common channel .",
    "it is shown that , exploiting local caches as side information , transmitting coded multicasts , i.e. , linear combinations of packets from different files , can significantly reduce the amount of data that is necessary to transmit over the channel .",
    "this concept is investigated in @xcite for the specific application of wireless networks . the central server is omitted and requests for content are served by mobile devices caching data , which broadcast interfile coded messages using device - to - device ( d2d ) communication .",
    "in wireless networks , mobile devices that cache content might move out of range . the impact of data loss when mobile devices leave the network is considered in @xcite .",
    "instantaneous repair of single device departures is investigated in @xcite and scheduled repair of lost content due to multiple devices leaving the network is treated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite consider a single file and it is shown that the use of erasure correcting codes help to reduce the amount of data that is downloaded from the base station ( bs ) . in @xcite",
    ", multiple files are cached in a number of small bss from which mobile devices download content .",
    "it is shown that caching content using maximum distance separable ( mds ) codes reduces the macro bs downlink traffic .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the use of mds codes to cache content in the mobile devices of a wireless cellular network .",
    "the devices roam between neighboring cells according to a poisson random process , similar to the modeling of device mobility in @xcite , and request files from a library at random times .",
    "files are encoded using mds codes of equal code length but potentially different code rate , and coded symbols are cached in a number of mobile devices .",
    "we formulate a mixed integer linear program ( milp ) to find the mds codes that minimize the network load , assuming a global average cache size constraint ( across all devices ) .",
    "we show that optimizing the rates of the mds codes may yield a significantly lower network load than when caching only the most popular files .",
    "we also show that , for the considered scenario , caching symbols of a given file on all mobile devices , i.e. , maximal spreading @xcite , is optimal .",
    "_ notation : _ @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 $ ] denote probability and expectation , respectively . a random variable @xmath2 that follows the binomial distribution with parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "we use bold lowercase letters @xmath6 to denote vectors . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the length-@xmath9 vectors with all entries @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we consider a large area of @xmath12 square units ( sq.u . ) consisting of many small cells with equal area @xmath13 sq.u . , each served by a bs .",
    "@xmath14 mobile devices are uniformly spread over the large area , which gives that the number of devices in a given small cell , denoted by @xmath2 , is binomially distributed as @xmath15 the expected number of devices initially available in a small cell , denoted by @xmath16 , is @xmath17 = { m_\\text{tot}}\\cdot { a}/{a_\\text{tot}}.\\ ] ] users wish to download files from a library of @xmath18 files that is always available at the bss .",
    "we assume that all files have equal size and that the file popularity follows the zipf distribution @xcite , i.e. , the popularity of file @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the skewness parameter of the distribution . _",
    "content allocation : _ each file @xmath19 that is to be cached is partitioned into @xmath22 packets and encoded into @xmath3 symbols using an @xmath23 mds code @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 coded symbols are cached in @xmath3 mobile devices ( possibly different for each file ) in the area , chosen uniformly at random .",
    "hence , for each file @xmath19 , the @xmath3 devices caching the file store a fraction @xmath24 of the file .",
    "thus , @xmath25 where @xmath26 implies that file @xmath19 is not cached .",
    "we define the vector @xmath27 and refer to it as the _ content allocation_.    the number of caching devices in a given small cell , denoted by @xmath28 , is binomially distributed as @xmath29 and the expected number of caching devices in a given small cell , denoted by @xmath9 , is @xmath30 = n \\cdot { a}/{a_\\text{tot}}.\\ ] ]    _ arrival - departure process : _ mobile devices roam in and out of a small cell .",
    "we assume that the arrival of mobile devices caching a coded symbol of a given file and the arrival of devices not caching a symbol of the file are two independent arrival processes with interarrival times exponentially independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) with rates @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , per time unit ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "therefore , the overall arrival rate is @xmath34 .",
    "each device has an exponential i.i.d .",
    "lifetime with rate @xmath35 @xmath33 before departing the small cell .",
    "hence , the number of devices in the cell follows a poisson birth - death process with rate @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath37 and @xmath38 and , hence , the expected number of devices and the expected number of caching devices in the small cell is @xmath16 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "this process can be characterized by an @xmath39 queueing model where the instantaneous probability of having @xmath40 caching devices in the cell is @xcite @xmath41 note that this model predicts a nonzero probability that the number of mobile devices in a small cell is larger than @xmath14 , which violates our initial assumption on the total number of devices in the area .",
    "however , we consider scenarios where @xmath42 , such that this probability is negligibly small .    _ data download : _ mobile devices request files at random times with the time between requests exponentially i.i.d . with rate @xmath43 @xmath33",

    "@xmath22 coded symbols are sufficient to decode the file @xcite .",
    "the user requesting content downloads as many coded symbols as possible ( up to @xmath22 ) from available caching devices and , if additional symbols are required , these are retrieved from the bs . the equivalent number of files that are downloaded from the bs per t.u .",
    "is defined as the _ downlink rate _ and the equivalent number of files downloaded from caching devices ( per t.u . )",
    "is defined as the _ d2d communication rate_. we assume that the communication is error free and incurs zero delay .",
    "in this section , we derive the probability to have a number of caching devices available at the time of a request . for later use , we define @xmath46 as the event that there are @xmath40 caching devices available at the time of a request for file @xmath19 .",
    "we also define @xmath47 and @xmath48 as the events that the request comes from a caching device and comes from a noncaching device , respectively .",
    "we have the following proposition .    @xmath49    the probability of having @xmath40 mobile devices caching a coded symbol of file @xmath19 at the time of a request for file @xmath19 is @xmath50    the probability @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 since the number of caching devices and the number of noncaching devices are poisson distributed with rates @xmath9 and @xmath53 , respectively , the expected fraction of mobile devices caching a coded symbol of file @xmath19 is @xmath54 .",
    "a request is equally likely to come from any mobile device and we have that @xmath55 and @xmath56 using , @xmath57 if there is a request for file @xmath19 from a caching device ( event @xmath47 ) there is at least one caching device in the cell . the probability that there are @xmath40 caching devices in the cell is the probability that @xmath58 additional caching devices are available , i.e. , @xmath59 using . using  with in , we get .    the amount of data that is downloaded from the bs and from the mobile devices is given by the following proposition .",
    "[ prop : gamma ] provided that there are @xmath40 mobile devices caching a coded symbol of file @xmath19 in the small cell , then , for a given request for file @xmath19 , the fraction of the file that is downloaded from the bs is @xmath60 the fraction of file @xmath19 that is downloaded from caching devices if the request comes from a mobile device not caching a coded symbol of file @xmath19 is @xmath61 and if the request comes from a device caching a symbol of file @xmath19 @xmath62    we require @xmath22 coded symbols to decode file @xmath19 . if at the time of a request for file @xmath19 there are @xmath63 devices caching a symbol of file @xmath19 in the small cell , @xmath64 symbols are retrieved from the bs .",
    "if @xmath65 , no symbols are downloaded from the bs . hence , the fraction of file @xmath19 that is downloaded from the bs is given by .",
    "following the same argument , it is trivial to obtain and .",
    "the expected downlink rate for a content allocation @xmath66 , denoted by @xmath67 , is given by @xmath68 since the amount of data that is downloaded from the bs is the same , irrespective of whether the request comes from a caching or a noncaching device .",

    ", , and , @xmath71",
    "we consider the optimization of the content allocation @xmath66 such that the weighted communication rate @xmath72 is minimized . minimizing the expected downlink rate corresponds to @xmath73 .",
    "however , it might be desirable to also limit the d2d communication rate for various reasons , such as device battery constraints and interference between devices . therefore , we consider @xmath74 , where @xmath75 stems from the fact that the bottleneck is in the downlink .",
    "we enforce a global average cache size constraint , denoted by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 this implies an average cache size constraint per device @xmath78 .",
    "the optimization problem can be formulated as    [ p1 ] @xmath79    we denote by @xmath80 the _ optimal _ content allocation resulting from .",
    "the objective function can be rewritten as shown in ( at the top of the page ) using and . it is clear that the objective function is a sum of piecewise linear functions of @xmath81 .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the optimization problem in a way that is tractable , using the epigraph formulation @xcite . using and introducing a new optimization variable @xmath82 ,",
    "the optimization problem can be written equivalently as    [ p2 ] @xmath83    where the constraints and arise from the first and second term in the @xmath84 function in .",

    "in figs . [ fig : ratevsn][fig : ratevstheta ] we evaluate the downlink rate and the weighted communication rate for several content allocations @xmath66 . besides the optimal content allocation @xmath80 , we consider a _",
    "popular _ content allocation , where each of the @xmath89 most popular files is cached in @xmath3 ( possibly different ) mobile devices ( i.e. , using an @xmath90 repetition code ) .",

    "proportional _ content allocation , @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "we remark that the proportional content allocation typically leads to noninteger @xmath22 file partitions .",
    "albeit impractical , this content allocation is interesting for comparison purposes .",
    "for the results , we consider a file library with @xmath94 files and zipf parameter @xmath95 .",
    "we assume departure rate @xmath96 @xmath33 and request rate @xmath97 @xmath33 .",
    "note that the optimal content allocation does not depend on @xmath43 .",

    ", the global average cache size constraint becomes a strict cache size constraint , i.e. , @xmath101 .",
    "we recall that @xmath102 , using and .",
    "we observe that the downlink rate decreases with @xmath103 for both the optimal and proportional content allocations , i.e. , maximal spreading @xcite is optimal .",

    "this is because @xmath76 decreases as @xmath103 increases and a smaller number of complete files can be cached in the mobile devices . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the downlink rate using the popular content allocation is almost 80% higher compared to when using the optimal content allocation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratevsm ] , we show the weighted communication rate @xmath106 in versus the expected number of mobile devices in the small cell , @xmath16 , for @xmath100 , i.e. , maximal spreading , and @xmath107 .",
    "the expected accumulated cache capacity of the devices in the small cell , @xmath108 , grows with @xmath16 but so does the expected request rate @xmath44 .",
    "an increase of @xmath108 leads to a decrease of @xmath106 , while an increase of @xmath44 leads to an increase of @xmath106 .",
    "it is observed in the figure that @xmath106 increases with @xmath16 , i.e. , the effect of an increase in weighted communication rate due to the increased request rate dominates the performance . for small @xmath16 , @xmath106 is similar for all considered content allocations .",
    "however , for larger @xmath16 , mds coded caching with optimized code rates yields significantly lower weighted communication rate . compared to the optimal content allocation , the popular content allocation and the proportional content allocation involve roughly a 50% and a 10% increase , respectively , in the weighted communication rate for @xmath109 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratevstheta ] , the weighted communication rate in is plotted for the considered content allocations as a function of @xmath105 for @xmath110 and @xmath109 .",
    "we see that the weighted communication rate increases linearly with @xmath105 for the popular and proportional content allocations .",
    "this is expected since these content allocations are obviously not affected by changing @xmath105 .",
    "the weighted communication rate for the optimal content allocation is on the other hand not monotonically increasing with @xmath105 . for @xmath111 ,",
    "the weight of the downlink rate in and the d2d communication rate in is the same , i.e. , it is equally `` expensive '' to download files from the bs and the caching devices .",
    "it is easy to prove that , for integer @xmath76 , the optimal content allocation for @xmath111 is the popular content allocation .",
