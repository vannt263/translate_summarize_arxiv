    "the hka , which is an abbreviation of  heat kernel approach to interest rate modelling , was introduced by one of the authors and his collaborators in @xcite .",
    "briefly speaking , hka is a systematic method to produce a tractable interest rate model which is  markov functional \" in the sense of hunt - kennedy - pelsser @xcite . in the fundamental paper @xcite ,",
    "four different types of implementation methods are introduced .",
    "namely , 1 ) eigenfunction models 2 ) weighted hka 3 ) killed hka and 4 ) trace approach .",
    "as is pointed out in @xcite , the eigenfunction models are tailor - made for swaption pricing , and a deeper understanding for its mathematical structure leads to the trace approach , which is mathematically most involved .",
    "the weighted hka is extended to time - inhomogeneous setting and applied to information - based models by j. akahori and a. macrina @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we will demonstrate how the killed hka is applied to the modelling of defaultable bonds by constructing a market where the market price of risk and the default probability are  built in the same block \" ( whose precise meaning will be given later ) .",
    "we stress that the hka is basically a state - price density approach where everything is written under the physical= statistical measure .",
    "since the hka furthermore gives an analytically tractable model in nature , the framework proposed in this paper would be promising in respect of modelling defaultable markets .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . after recalling the _ plain - vanilla",
    "_ hka in section [ pvhka ] and the killed hka in section [ khka ] , we shall give the main result , a framework with in the killed hka to model a defaultable bond market in section [ fmw ] . in section [ qe ] , we will give some simulation results of an explicit example with a quadratic form of wiener process .",

    "we work on a probability space @xmath2 with filtration @xmath3 .",

    "let @xmath6 be an @xmath7-valued markov process .",
    "we shall say that a function @xmath8 satisfies the _ propagation property _ if @xmath9=p(t+s , x)\\ ] ] holds for any @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the following fact is initialized by @xcite and developed in @xcite .",

    "we then recall , and give a more detailed description to , the killed hka .",
    "let @xmath22 be a non - negative measurable function on @xmath7 .",

    "the bond pays a unit account at the maturity @xmath36 unless it defaults .",
    "2 .   at the default time @xmath40 , nothing will be recovered .",
    "3 .   the state variable is a markov process @xmath41 , which is observable in the market .",
    "the default probability is completely determined through the information of @xmath18 in the following manner ; the hazard rate of the default time on the filtration @xmath42 is given by @xmath43   = \\exp \\left(- \\int_0^t v ( x^x_u ) \\,du \\right ) $ ] where @xmath44 is the natural filtration on @xmath18 and @xmath39 is a non - negative measurable function .",
