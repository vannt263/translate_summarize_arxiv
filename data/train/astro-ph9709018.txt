    "the origin of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , discovered almost 35 years ago ( giacconi et al . , 1962 ) , represents one of the long - standing problem of modern cosmology ( see the reviews by fabian and barcons , 1992 ; setti and comastri , 1996 ) .",
    "the very small deviation from a blackbody shape of the cosmic microwave background spectrum seems to have put to rest the suggestion that a significant fraction of the cxb is due to truly diffuse emission from a hot intergalactic medium ( mather et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "therefore only the alternative interpretation , the discrete sources origin , is left .",
    "x - ray surveys provide a powerful tool to study the nature and properties of the classes of x - ray emitters which produce the cxb . in the soft x - ray energy band ( @xmath8 kev ) , where grazing incidence focusing optics have been used , deep surveys conducted with the rosat observatory ( hasinger et al . , 1993 ; branduardi - raymont et al . , 1994 ; vikhilin et al . , 1995 )",
    "have revealed a surface density of x - ray sources of @xmath9 deg@xmath7 at a flux limit of @xmath10 ( 0.5  2.0 kev ) , contributing @xmath11 60 - 65 % of the cxb in the same energy band .",
    "the differential log(n)log(s ) can be described ( see e.g. hasinger et al . , 1993 ) by a broken power - law model with slope @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 . at brighter fluxes a good agreement",
    "is found with the surface density previously obtained using data from the _ einstein _ observatory ( primini et al . , 1991 ; gioia et al . ,",
    "1990 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the rosat sources along with the results obtained by the _ einstein _",
    "observatory extended medium sensitivity survey identification program ( emss ; gioia et al . , 1990 ; stocke et al . , 1991 ; maccacaro et al . ,",
    "1994 ) have allowed us to clarify the nature and composition of the sources which shine in the soft x - ray sky .",
    "broad line agns constitute the majority of the soft x - ray sources at the fluxes actually sampled : they represent @xmath16 of the sources in the emss ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 of the rosat sources with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ; shanks et al . , 1991 ;",
    "boyle et al . , 1993;1994;1995 ; jones et al . ,",
    "1997 ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies are the next most numerous class of extragalactic sources in bright x - ray surveys . at @xmath21 , for example , they represent @xmath22 of the sources in the emss",
    ". however they become less important as one moves to fainter fluxes ( rosati et al . ,",
    "1995 ) .",
    "an important minority ( @xmath23 ) of the rosat sources are spectroscopically identified with x - ray luminous galaxies , consisting of both early - type and narrow emission line galaxies ( griffiths et al .",
    ", 1995 ; 1996 ) .",
    "according to their cosmological evolution properties ( griffiths et al . , 1996 )",
    "these objects could become increasingly more important at fainter fluxes and could constitute a significant fraction of the largely unidentified sources present at the rosat deep surveys flux limit . the real nature of these objects ( obscured agn ?",
    "starburst galaxies ? ) is at the moment unclear .",
    "based on studies on the cosmological properties of the known classes of objects it is now evident that their combined contribution to the soft cxb is approaching 100 per cent ( see e.g. broad line agn : boyle et al . , 1993;1994 ; jones et al .",
    ", 1997 ; clusters of galaxies ; rosati et al . , 1995 ; x - ray luminous galaxies : boyle et al . , 1995 ; griffiths et al .",
    ", 1995;1996 ) .",
    "in contrast , our knowledge of the nature and composition of the sources which produce the 2 - 10 kev cxb , closer to where the bulk of the energy density resides , is quite scanty . before asca ( acronym for _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ) , the surveys in this energy range were made using passively collimated x - ray detectors .",
    "these instruments were able to measure accurately the cxb spectrum ( which is remarkably well fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with a temperature of the order of 40 kev , see marshall et al .",
    ", 1980 ; gruber et al . , 1992 ) but , because of the limited spatial resolution , they were only able to resolve the brightest x - ray sources which represent only a small fraction ( @xmath24 ) of the cxb .",
    "the only statistically complete and large sample of x - ray sources in the 2 - 10 kev energy band was obtained from the a-2 experiment on heao-1 ( piccinotti et al . , 1982 ) .",
    "this sample is composed of 85 sources ( excluding the lmc and smc ) , brighter than @xmath25 , found in @xmath26 of the sky at @xmath27 . of the 62 sources of extragalactic origin about",
    "half are agn and half are cluster of galaxies .",
    "source counts down to a flux of @xmath28 were obtained by kondo et al . , 1991 using data from the _ ginga _ satellite .",
    "a small sample of 11 sources was derived from the analysis of 383 square degrees .",
    "the _ ginga _ fluctuations analysis ( warwick and stewart , 1989 ; butcher et al . , 1997 )",
    "extend the study of the number - flux relationship to a flux of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "however these studies are model dependent ( the spectral and clustering properties of the sources have to be assumed ) and do not give direct indications on the intrinsic nature of the x - ray emitters which are responsible of the cxb .    the so called  spectral paradox \" , i.e.",
    "none of the single classes of known x - ray emitters is characterized by an energy spectral distribution similar to that of the cxb , further complicates the situation .",
    "given this frustrating situation , a method to derive the contribution to the hard cxb of the different classes of x - ray sources through population synthesis models was developed ( i.e. by using their average broad - band spectral properties folded with their cosmological evolution properties determined in the soft x - ray energy band ) . among the proposed classes of x - ray emitters that could be important for the production of the hard cxb",
    "there are reflection dominated agn ( fabian , 1989 ; zdziarski et al . ,",
    "1993 and reference therein ) , strongly absorbed agn ( setti and woltjer , 1989 ; madau ghisellini and fabian , 1994 ; comastri et al . ,",
    "1995 ) and starburst galaxies ( griffiths and padovani , 1990 ) .",
    "it is clear that a direct measurement , through selection of a sample of hard x - ray emitters , is therefore crucial to test competing models .",
    "the asca satellite is carrying the first imaging instrument in the 2 - 10 kev energy band .",
    "this gives us the possibility to determine the surface density of hard x - ray selected sources to @xmath30 directly from the source counts and to clarify the nature of the x - ray emitters which are responsible of the hard cxb through optical spectroscopic follow up observations .",
    "in this paper we report preliminary results on a medium survey program in the 2 - 10  kev energy range using data from the gis2 instrument onboard the asca observatory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the criteria for the selection and construction of the images used , for the selection of the sources and for the definition of the sky coverage . in section 3",
    "we report the main result obtained so far : the number counts relationship , derived * directly from source counts * , down to a flux limit of @xmath3 .",
    "we compare this log(n@xmath2s)logs with previous results from heao-1 and _ ginga _ , with new results obtained from other groups using asca deep survey fields and with the extrapolation of the log(n@xmath2s)logs from the soft x - ray energy band . finally in section 4 a discussion and conclusions",
    "are presented .",
    "asca ( tanaka , inoue and holt , 1994 ; serlemitsos et al . , 1995 ) was launched on 1993 february 20 by the japanese institute for space astronautical science .",
    "the focal plane instrumentation consists of two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( hereafter sis0 and sis1 or in general sis ) and two gas imaging spectrometers ( hereafter gis2 and gis3 or in general gis ) , simultaneously operating .    for the purpose of this survey",
    "we have decided to use the gis2 instrument for the following reasons :    \\a ) the gis has a circular field of view of @xmath31 diameter , @xmath32 times larger than the sis field of view of @xmath33 ( when used in 4 ccd mode ) .",
    "furthermore only a limited number of asca observations were made with the sis in the 4-ccd mode option ;    \\b ) for energies above @xmath34 kev the effective area of the gis is larger than the effective area of the sis ;",
    "\\c ) the gis2 detector has a larger area uncontaminated from a high non - x - ray background than the gis3 ( see the announcement of opportunity eao_1 ; asca guest investigator programme ) .",
    "the asca public data considered here were extracted from the public archive ( as of february 14 , 1996 ) .",
    "we have excluded from the survey those fields centered on :    \\1 ) @xmath35    \\2 ) targets in the large and small magellanic clouds    \\3 ) very bright ( see section 2.4 ) and/or extended targets , e.g. supernovae remnants , very rich and nearby clusters of galaxies ;    \\4 ) groups and/or associations of targets , e.g. groups of nearby galaxies , star clusters or stellar association .",
    "all these selection criteria were applied to avoid regions of high galactic absorption and high stellar density , to dismiss images where the background map ( see section 2.2 ) could not be produced reliably and to prevent including in the survey sources not truly serendipitous ( e.g. physically related to the target ) .",
    "we have also excluded from the analysis those images with an exposure time ( after the data cleaning , see below ) less than 10000 s since their sensitivity is so poor that they do not significantly contribute to the sky coverage of the survey .",
    "finally in the case of two or more overlapping images we have retained only the deepest one .",
    "a total of 87 gis2 fields ( listed in table 1 ) survive to these selection criteria .",
    "image preparation has been performed using version 1.2 of the xselect software package and version 3.2 of ftools .",
    "good time intervals were selected by applying standard cleaning criteria , the most relevant being a magnetic cut - off rigidity threshold of 6 ( cor_min @xmath2 6 ) and a minimum elevation angle of 6 ( elv_min @xmath2 6 ) .",
    "we have also excluded from the analysis periods of time that are within 60 s from the south atlantic anomaly passage and within 100 s from the day / night transition passage . finally , images were extracted in the 2 - 10  kev energy range , in detector coordinates and considering only the events within 20 arcmin from the detector center .",
    "the pixel size of these images is @xmath36 .      to localize and characterize the faint sources contained in the selected fields we need to estimate the underlying background as precisely as possible .",
    "a detailed description of the properties of the gis2 background is reported in kubo et al . , 1994 and ikebe et al . , 1995 .",
    "in brief the gis2 background consists of non x - ray background ( nxb ) and cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) ; the first one increases from the center to the edge of the detector while the latter one shows an opposite behavior .    after a detailed radial and azimuthal analysis of the background properties in 30 gis2 images ( which do not show evident x - ray sources ) we reached the conclusion that the gis2 background has a structure that is reproduced from image to image . for these reasons",
    "we have decided to use the blank - sky event files , which include both the nxb and cxb .",
    "these blank - sky event files have been constructed by the gis team summing a total of 15 separate pointings of blank fields and have been made publicly available .    in order to match as closely as possible the selection criteria used to extract the survey images we have extracted blank - sky images ( hereafter bsi ) in the 2 - 10 kev energy band including only the events with a magnetic cut - off rigidity threshold above 6 .",
    "we have then applied the following multi - step procedure to each image ( hereafter _ i m a _ ) :    \\a ) a first estimate of the background statistics in _",
    "i m a _ has been determined in 3 boxes ( each of size @xmath37 ) which do not contain evident x - ray sources .",
    "median values of the mean and standard deviation from these 3 regions have been considered ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) ;    \\b ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 have been used to define the region ( hereafter @xmath40 ) in _ i m a _ where the counts ( per pixel ) are @xmath41 ;    \\c ) this region has been used to produce a normalized version of the background map ( hereafter _ back _ ) by rescaling the bsi according to :    @xmath42    we have preferred to normalize in this way the exposure map , rather than by using the exposure time , because from our analysis of the 30 gis2 images we have found that the background rate can significantly change from image to image in its intensity but not in the overall structure across the field .",
    "\\d ) _ i m a _ and _ back _ have been then smoothed with a bidimensional gaussian with @xmath43 , which is comparable to the  core \" of the ( xrt+gis2 ) psf ;    \\e ) the smoothed version of _ back _ has been subtracted from the smoothed version of _ i m a _ in order to obtain a background - subtracted image ( hereafter _ ima - back _ ) ;    \\f ) contour plots in _ ima - back _ have been used to localize the contiguous pixels ( hereafter _ peaks _ ) which are 0.5@xmath39 above the local mean .",
    "the value of 0.5@xmath39 has been determined empirically and ensure completeness above the source detection threshold of 3.5 used ( see below ) ;    \\g ) net counts , in a circle of 2 arcmin radius around each of these peaks , are computed by subtracting the background counts accumulated in _",
    "back _ from the total counts accumulated in _",
    "i m a _ ;    \\h ) sources are accepted as real if the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , defined as [ ( net counts / ( net counts + background)@xmath44 ) ] , is greater than 3.5 .    excluding the sources related to the targets and the targets themselves , a total of 60 x - ray sources satisfy the criteria for the inclusion in the survey .    in table 2 ( not reported in the pre - print version ) we report the basic data for the 60 sources in the sample .",
    "in particular we list the name , the asca ror where the source was found , celestial ( j2000 ) coordinates , the signal - to - noise ratio , the corrected flux ( and its error ) and the galactic @xmath45 along the line of sight .",
    "we note that the absolute accuracy of the asca attitude solution is of the order of 2 arcmin .      in order to obtain the correct flux of the sources we must now consider the position dependent sensitivity of the gis2 detector .",
    "in particular we must take into account : a ) the fraction of the source photons falling outside the 2 arcmin circle radius ; b ) the variation of the sensitivity of the detector as a function of the distance from the optical axis due to vignetting and c ) the variation of the ( xrt+gis2 ) psf across the field of view .",
    "these effects are taken into consideration by the ftools task ascaarf which is able to produce a position - dependent psf - corrected effective area of the ( xrt+gis2 ) combination .",
    "in essence the input of ascaarf is the position @xmath46 ( in detector coordinates ) and the dimension of the source extraction region @xmath47 ( in our case a circle with a radius of 2 arcmin ) .    using ascaarf ( version 2.64 )",
    "we have produced a raster scan of the effective area values across the gis2 field of view and used them ( through spectral simulation with xspec ) to obtain the count rate to flux conversion factors ( @xmath48 ) relative to each position @xmath49 in the detector .",
    "in the spectral simulations we have used a power law model with energy index equal to 0.7 , filtered by a galactic absorbing column density of @xmath50 cm@xmath7 . the count rate to flux",
    "conversion factors are a very weak function of the galactic absorbing column density along the line of sight ( which ranges from @xmath52 cm@xmath7 to @xmath53 cm@xmath7 for the present sample ) and are accurate to @xmath54 for all the energy spectral indices in the range 0.51.0 .",
    "the flux of each source has then been computed and is listed in table 2 .      the sky coverage ( i.e. , the area covered as a function of the flux limit ) of the present survey has been determined in the following way . at each position of a raster scan of a given image we have used the corresponding background map to compute the total counts that a source should have had to be detected at the 3.5 s / n level .",
    "these counts have been then converted to count rate and then flux using the same conversion factors ( @xmath48 ) used for the sources .",
    "the area associated with the target has been excluded from the sky coverage computation ; to this purpose we have considered as target area the circle defined by the location where the expected counts from the pointed source are @xmath55 of those of the background in the corresponding background map .",
    "the circles associated to the targets range between 6 arcmin to 10 arcmin radius . in the case of circles greater than 12 arcmin radius",
    "we have excluded the whole field from the survey .",
    "an integral representation of the sky coverage is reported in figure 1 .",
    "the raster scan used to compute the sky coverage allows us to estimate the number of expected spurious sources in the survey .",
    "the number of background counts in _ back _ inside a circle of 2 arcmin radius is a function of a ) the image exposure time and b ) the circle position in the image . the background counts range between 10 and 15 counts for an image with an exposure time of @xmath56 ksec , between 35 and 50 counts for an image with an exposure time of @xmath57 ksec and between 65 and 85 counts for an image with an exposure time of @xmath58 ksec . considering the extremes of these values ,",
    "the requirement of s / n = 3.5 implies that a minimum of 19 ( 39 ) net counts have to be recorded on top of the 10 ( 85 ) background counts . for a poisson distribution the probability of observing 29 ( 124 ) total counts or more when 10 ( 85 ) are expected is @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we note that the 4 @xmath39 level in gaussian statistics is @xmath61 .",
    "the number of resolution elements of this survey is @xmath62 ( total area divided by the detection cell area ) ; thus the number of spurious sources expected is @xmath63 .",
    "in figure  2 we show ( open circles ) a non - parametric representation of the number - flux relationship , obtained by folding the sky coverage with the flux of each source .",
    "because we are primarily interested in the extragalactic number - flux relationship we have excluded from the computation two sources ( a0341 - 4353 and a1410 + 5215 ) which are suspected to be stars . in the same figure",
    "we also report a parametric representation ( solid line ) of the logn(@xmath2s)logs , obtained by applying the maximum likelihood method to the unbinned data ( see gioia et al.,1990 for details on these two representations ) .",
    "the fit has been performed from a flux of @xmath3 ( the faintest detectable flux ) to a flux of @xmath64 . for fluxes brighter than this limit",
    "we may not be complete since most of the  bright \" x - ray sources were chosen as target of the observations and then excluded , by definition , from the survey .",
    "however we note that the space density of sources with flux greater than @xmath64 is such that less than 0.2 sources are expected in this survey .",
    "we also note that less than 1 source is expected with flux between @xmath3 and @xmath65 ( the flux of the faintest detected source ) .",
    "the logn(@xmath2s)logs can be described by a power law model n(@xmath2s ) = k @xmath66 with best fit value for the slope of @xmath67 ; the @xmath68 and @xmath69 confidence intervals are equal to [ 1.49;1.84 ] and [ 1.38;1.96 ] respectively ( see table 3 ) .",
    "the normalization k is determined by rescaling the model to the actual number of objects in the sample and , in the case of the  best \" fit model , is equal to k = @xmath70 deg@xmath7 .",
    "the two dotted lines in figure 2 represent the @xmath71 confidence intervals on the slope .",
    "a consistent  best \" fit model is obtained if we consider only the 26 sources detected with a s / n ratio greater than 5 and the corresponding sky coverage ( @xmath72 ; k = @xmath73 deg@xmath7 ) .",
    "the filled square at @xmath74 represents the surface density of the extragalactic population in the piccinotti et al .",
    ", 1982 sample , corrected for the 20% excess of sources due to the local superclusters ( as estimated by comastri et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the filled triangle at @xmath75 represents the surface density of x - ray sources as determined by kondo et al . , 1991 using a small sample of 11 sources extracted from the ginga high galactic latitude survey .",
    "finally , the surface densities represented by the filled dots at @xmath76 and @xmath77 are preliminary results from an ongoing asca survey programs conducted on a more limited area of sky ( as reported in inoue et al . , 1996 ) , while the filled dot at @xmath78 is a recent results obtained by georgantopoulus et al . , 1997 using 3 deep asca gis observations .",
    "consistent results ( at a flux limit of @xmath79 ) are obtained using data from the bepposax deep surveys ( p. giommi , private communication ) .",
    "figure  2 shows that we have extended the description of the ( 2 - 10 kev ) number - flux relationship by a factor @xmath80 with respect to the piccinotti et al .",
    ", ( 1982 ) determination , with a sample of similar size .",
    "we can now evaluate , directly from the source counts , the contribution of the resolved sources to the 2 - 10 kev cxb .",
    "this contribution is the ratio between the background surface brightness and the emissivity of the objects under study , which is obtained via integration of the observed logn(@xmath2s)logs .    in the 2 - 10",
    "kev energy range the spectrum of the cxb can be described by a power law representation with energy spectral index equal to 0.4 and normalization equal to 8 kev cm@xmath7 s@xmath81 sr@xmath81 kev@xmath81 ( see the review of hasinger , 1996 ) , implying a background surface brightness of @xmath82 kev cm@xmath7 s@xmath81 sr@xmath81 .",
    "the emissivity of the resolved objects , @xmath83 , is given by @xmath84 where s is the source flux , n(s)ds is the differential representation of the number - flux relationship and @xmath85 is the limiting flux considered .    using the logn(@xmath2s)logs best fit model ( and the @xmath86 % confidence interval ) and @xmath87 ( the flux limit of the survey ) we obtain @xmath88 kev cm@xmath7 s@xmath81 sr@xmath81 , which represents about 27% of the 2 - 10 kev cxb .",
    "we note that our determination of the total intensity produced by the detected sources is _ independent _ of the intensity of the cxb and therefore @xmath83 is not affected by the possible uncertainties which could affect the estimate of the cxb .",
    "the logn(@xmath2s)logs best fit model implies the saturation of the 2 - 10 kev cxb at a flux of @xmath89 . therefore deeper x - ray surveys in this energy range ( e.g. the sax , jet - x and xmm deep surveys ) should find a flattening of the number - flux relationship in the range @xmath89  @xmath3 , i.e. within a factor @xmath56 from the present flux limit .",
    "it is clear that a decisive and final understanding of the real nature of the hard x - ray sources in this sample must await their spectroscopic identification .",
    "in the meantime we can infer useful information on their nature by comparing the measured 2 - 10 kev logn(@xmath2s)logs with that extrapolated from the soft energy band and with the predictions obtained from population synthesis models .",
    "in figure 3 we display the logn(@xmath2s)logs obtained in this work along with : a ) the soft ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) logn(@xmath2s)logs ( hasinger et al . , 1993 ) extrapolated to the 2 - 10 kev energy band assuming a power law spectral model with energy indices equal to 1 , 0.7 , 0.4 and 0.2 ( dotted lines ) ; and b ) the prediction of the comastri et al . , ( 1995 )",
    "model which is based on the unification scheme of the agns ( solid line ) .",
    "the first comparison clearly shows a well known problem ( see e.g. warwick and stewart , 1989 ) : if we estimate the hard x - ray logn(@xmath2s)logs by extrapolating the soft x - ray logn(@xmath2s)logs and using the mean spectral properties of the sources , as determined in the soft ( 0.5  2.0 kev ) energy band ( @xmath90 , see e.g. almaini et al . , 1996 )",
    ", we fail to reproduce it .",
    "in particular we predict a surface density , at a flux of the order of @xmath91 , which is at least a factor @xmath92 less than the observed one .",
    "since at fluxes brighter than @xmath29 the principal contribution to the source counts in the soft energy band is due to broad line agns ( seyfert 1 and qsos ) we should see a drastic change of their mean spectral properties going from the soft to the hard energy band .",
    "this hypothesis seems to be contradicted by the observations ( see e.g. comastri et al . , 1992 ; williams et al .",
    ", 1992 ; matsuoka and cappi , 1996 ; cappi et al . ,",
    "1997 ) .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that , in the hard energy band , we are selecting a population of sources which is actually undersampled in the soft x - ray surveys ( e.g. the heavily absorbed agns in the madau , ghisellini and fabian , 1994 and comastri et al . , 1995 models ) . in this respect",
    "it is worth noting the discovery ( ohta et al . , 1996 ) of a type 2 qsos at z=0.9 in an asca sis observation of the lynx field .",
    "in particular the model of comastri et al . , ( 1995 ) is based on the x - rays properties of the unification scheme of agns : according to this model a population of absorbed and unabsorbed agns , when folded with the cosmological evolution properties determined in the soft x - ray energy band , is able to reproduce the shape and intensity of the cxb from several kev to @xmath93 kev . as shown in figure 3 the predicted 2 - 10 kev logn(@xmath2s)-logs of comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( reported as a solid line ) in the flux range @xmath79 - @xmath94 is in very good agreement with our determination .",
    "if this model is correct we can predict that @xmath95 agns and @xmath96 clusters of galaxies should be present among the 60 sources of the present sample .",
    "the expected composition of the agns population in this survey as a function of the intrinsic @xmath45 is reported in table 4 .",
    "the population of agns x - ray emitters with intrinsic @xmath45 in the range @xmath97 cm@xmath7 is the most interesting one : according to comastri et al .",
    ", 1995 they should produce the largest fraction of the cxb in the 2  100 kev energy range and should be practically invisible in soft x - ray surveys even at the faintest fluxes reachable with current and future x - ray missions .",
    "we are planning to extend the survey by a factor of @xmath98 by analyzing all the available and suitable public gis2 data . in the meantime",
    "we have started a program to identify the optical counterparts of the x - ray sources .",
    "the main problem with the spectroscopic follow up is the absolute accuracy of the asca attitude solution ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "fortunately rosat pspc data are available for most of the selected gis2 fields , allowing us to greatly reduce the x - ray errors circle for many of the x - ray sources associated with unabsorbed agn and with clusters of galaxies .",
    "a comparison of the asca and rosat spectra of the selected sources with that of the cxb is in progress and will be published elsewhere .",
