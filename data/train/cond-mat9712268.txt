    "<S> traffic jam in a fluid model of traffic flows proposed by kerner and konhuser ( b. s. kerner and p. konhuser , phys . rev . * </S>",

    "<S> an analytic scaling solution is presented near the critical point of the hetero - clinic bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the solution has been confirmed from the comparison with the simulation of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> cooperative behavior in dissipative systems composed of discrete elements has attracted much interest of physicists . </S>",
    "<S> traffic flows have been studied extensively  @xcite as one of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> they can be classified into discrete models and continuous models . </S>",
    "<S> the former includes the cellular automaton model @xcite and the optimal velocity model@xcite , and the latter dose the fluid models . </S>",
    "<S> recently kerner and konhuser @xcite have proposed a fluid model of traffic flows which is regarded as a standard one . </S>",
    "<S> since these models are aimed to describe common phenomena such as traffic - jam formation , they should have universal properties as stressed by hayakawa and nakanishi  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to confirm the universality of traffic - jam formation . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we quantitatively compare the results for the fluid model with those for a discrete model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> komatsu and sasa @xcite have revealed the mechanism of jam formation in the optimal velocity model proposed by bando _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with the aid of the perturbational treatment of solitons . </S>",
    "<S> hayakawa and nakanishi @xcite have developed the analysis of komatsu and sasa @xcite , and analyzed in detail a generalized optimal velocity model @xmath0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the positions of @xmath3-th car and the sensitivity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the driver at @xmath1 takes care of not only the forward distance @xmath4 but also the backward distance @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal velocity function w is a monotonic increasing function , and v is a monotonic decreasing function . </S>",
    "<S> hayakawa and nakanishi @xcite have obtained a scaled asymmetric kink solution of this model . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> komatsu @xcite has shown from his simulation that the fluid model by kerner and konhuser @xcite has also a scaled asymmetric kink solution as that in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ovmodel ] ) . here , we will clarify the relation between the model by kerner and konhuser and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ovmodel ] ) , based on the method developed by hayakawa and nakanishi @xcite . as a result , we will demonstrate that the behavior of the fluid model dose not contain essential differences from that of the discrete models . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the validity of our analysis will be confirmed from the comparison with our simulation of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> kerner and konhuser proposed a one - dimensional compressible fluid model for traffic flow in a highway @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the field of car density , and @xmath8 is the field of car velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath9 with the relaxation time @xmath10 represents the relaxation process , where the optimal velocity field @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath12 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ovmodel ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure term with the strength @xmath13 and the viscous term with the effective viscosity @xmath14 stabilize the solution of the model , which is the effects implicitly included in the model  ( [ eq : ovmodel ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the optimal velocity @xmath15 can be estimated from the relation between density and velocity of cars observed in real traffic flows in highways @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its explicit form is assumed to be @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the paper by kerner and konhuser @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the linear stability of a uniform flow , @xmath17 , in the fluid model  ( [ eq : kkmodel ] ) . the linearized equation of the model  ( [ eq : kkmodel ] ) in the neighborhood of this uniform state is @xmath18 where @xmath19\u001b@xmath20\u001b(band @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : linear ] ) satisfies @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a wave number . </S>",
    "<S> the growth rate @xmath24 in the solution @xmath25 of this equation is the solution of @xmath26 this equation has two solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for instability of the uniform state is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is one of the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , @xmath29 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : unstable1 ] ) we find that @xmath30 is the neutral mode and the mode @xmath31 is the most unstable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when @xmath32 is satisfied , the uniform flow becomes unstable owing to emergence of the negative diffusion constant .    </S>",
    "<S> for later convenience , we explicitly write the expansion of @xmath28 around @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33    here , we notice that @xmath10 and @xmath14 are not included in the instability condition  ( [ eq : unstable ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we assume @xmath34 and @xmath35 by a proper transformation of the scales of the space , time and field quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we carry out the weakly nonlinear analysis . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , let us reduce the model  ( [ eq : kkmodel ] ) in the vicinity of neutral curve ( [ eq : unstable ] ) with the aid of the reductive perturbation method @xcite . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : longwave ] ) , the terms in proportion to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , must be balance . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since the term @xmath38 is eliminable by the galilei transformation , the term @xmath39 is the dominant in the dispersion relation , which should be balance with the lowest order nonlinear term . </S>",
    "<S> if the lowest nonlinear term is quadratic , the model is reduced to the korteweg - de vries ( k - dv ) equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the k - dv equation , however , has only pulse solutions , so it is unsuitable for a description of the traffic jam formation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we should choose the critical point which is the cross point of the neutral curve @xmath40 and @xmath41 where the cubic nonlinear term becomes dominant . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit critical point when we adopt eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ u ] ) is given by @xmath42    now let us look for a steady propagating solution in the neighborhood of this critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the scaled variable @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the positive free parameter which will be determined from the perturbation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> since the lowest nonlinear term becomes cubic , we assume following expansions : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 includes @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we substitute these expression into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : kkmodel ] ) and collect the terms in each power of @xmath51 . from the expression to the fifth order of @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52          = \\epsilon \\partial_x m[\\psi ] \\label{eq : reduce},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 & = & \\sqrt{c}\\bigg [ \\rho_{23 } \\partial_x^2 \\psi^2 - \\rho_{32 } \\partial_x \\psi^3 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{0.5 cm } { } - \\rho_{41 } \\psi^4 + \\rho_{14 } \\partial_x^3 \\psi - \\frac{\\rho_{12}}{c } \\partial_x \\psi \\bigg ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } + \\bigg [ \\frac{\\dot c}{2 c^{\\frac{5}{2}}}x \\psi_0 - c \\dot c t \\psi \\bigg ] , \\label{m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assume @xmath54 is @xmath50 , @xmath55 and @xmath56    here , assuming the expansion @xmath57 we obtain the following pair of asymmetric kink and anti - kink solutions in the lowest order . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 let us assume that the system satisfies the periodic boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> thus the solution should be modified as @xmath59 this solution shows two interfaces at the positions @xmath60 , and approximately satisfies the periodic boundary condition , though we notice that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : zero - pbc ] ) is only an approximate solution in the lowest order equation of ( [ eq : reduce ] ) . substituting ( [ eq : zero - pbc ] ) into ( [ eq : reduce ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 to obtain a regular behavior of perturbation in @xmath50 the perturbed solution should be orthogonal to the zero eigenfunction @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> a pair of special solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phi0 ] ) is given by @xmath69 and the corresponding solutions of ( [ zero - eq ] ) can be expressed by @xmath70 since @xmath65 should satisfy the periodic boundary condition as well as @xmath71 , we adopt the superposition of @xmath72 as @xmath73 the constants @xmath74 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ psi ] ) are determined to satisfy @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we choose @xmath76 where @xmath77 with the gamma function @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we rewrite the solvability condition  ( [ solva ] ) by the integration by parts @xmath79 \\big]_{-l}^{l}=\\bigl(\\phi_0(x ) , m[\\psi_0]\\bigr).\\ ] ] from ( [ m ] ) it is obvious that terms in @xmath80 $ ] have no contribution in the left hand side of ( [ solva2 ] ) except for terms in proportion to @xmath81 and @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the contribution from the term in proportion to @xmath83 vanishes because of its symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , since we adopt the periodic boundary condition , as in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : zero - pbc ] ) and ( [ psi0 ] ) , the contribution from the term @xmath81 is canceled . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the left hand side of ( [ solva2 ] ) is reduced to @xmath84 \\big]_{-l}^{l}=\\frac{\\dot c}{c^{\\frac{5}{2}}}l.\\ ] ] after computation of the right hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ solva2 ] ) , we obtain the time evolution equation of @xmath46 , @xmath85\\dot c = 4\\beta c^2&\\biggl [ & \\frac{\\theta_+}{\\theta_+^2 + 1}\\left(1-\\frac{c}{c_+}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } -\\frac{\\theta_-}{\\theta_-^2 + 1}\\left(1-\\frac{c}{c_-}\\right)\\biggr],\\hspace{0.5cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use @xmath86 here @xmath87 are given by @xmath88 which are expected to be the stable values of @xmath46 where a kink or an anti - kink exists under the free boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ hatten ] ) represents that the relaxation time for a steady state is divergent in proportion to the system size @xmath64 in the vicinity of the convergent value @xmath89 of c. from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ u ] ) and ( [ rinkai ] ) , each constant is determined as @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we obtain @xmath91 and @xmath89 is given by @xmath92}{c_- \\theta_+ ( \\theta_-^2 + 1 ) - c_+ \\theta_- ( \\theta_+^2 + 1)}.\\ ] ] thus the explicit value of @xmath89 is @xmath93    to check the validity of our analysis we perform the numerical simulation of the model  ( [ eq : kkmodel ] ) in the vicinity of the critical point under the periodic boundary condition . we adopt the classical fourth - order runge - kutta scheme to time and the eular scheme to space in our simulation . the analytic solution in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : kink ] ) , ( [ eq : zero - pbc ] ) , and ( [ eq : cstar ] ) was adopted as the initial condition for the fast convergence . </S>",
    "<S> we also have checked that the tendency to converged to @xmath89 from the random initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the scaling properties we perform the simulation for each parameter , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , until @xmath7 relaxes to a steady propagating state . here </S>",
    "<S> we change the space mesh size according to the divergence of the characteristic length in proportion to @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are plotted in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coex ] and [ fig : kink ] . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coex ] , points represent the maximum and minimum values of car density in each parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve represents the theoretical coexistence curve which is obtained from the above perturbation analysis as @xmath97 we emphasize that the deviation between simulation and theory is only @xmath98 at @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that we can see one of the branches in the linearly unstable region . </S>",

    "<S> the result of our simulation is asymptotically identical to our theoretical curve as @xmath100 , and reproduce an asymmetric pair of kink and anti - kink . as we have seen in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , our results of the simulation agree well with our theoretical analysis .    in conclusion , our results in the fluid model in eq .  </S>",
