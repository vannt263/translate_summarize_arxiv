    "the manifestation of quantum antiferromagnetism in parent cuprates,@xcite discovered soon after the birth of high-@xmath3 superconductivity in the doped materials,@xcite has led to intensive efforts to understand the nature of this phase both within the hubbard model , as well as its strong - coupling counterpart , the quantum heisenberg model.@xcite features such as the substantially reduced sublattice magnetization ( relative to the classical value ) as deduced from neutron - scattering experiments,@xcite the substantially enhanced linewidth observed in the two - magnon raman scattering experiments,@xcite as well as a detailed fitting of the temperature dependence of the spin correlation length@xcite have confirmed the importance of quantum spin fluctuations in these low - dimensional , low - spin systems .",

( iii ) is the af state destabilized by disorder at finite temperature , such that the nel temperature ( for dimensions @xmath15 ) is lowered ? to answer these questions we will examine the influence of diagonal disorder on various properties of the hubbard antiferromagnet , such as sublattice magnetization , quantum spin fluctuations , magnon energy and damping , nel temperature , hubbard energy gap , and electronic density of states .",
    "recently spin fluctuation effects were examined in impurity - doped antiferromagnets , both within the heisenberg model,@xcite as well as the hubbard model,@xcite in order to study magnetic dynamics in cuprate antiferromagnets doped with nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities such as zn , al , ga , and fe , ni , co respectively .",

    "the third , related , case is that of magnon scattering off mobile vacancies , as in hole - doped cuprates , which is of course much more efficient at destroying aflro ; spin correlation lengths of order of @xmath16 for hole concentration @xmath17 have been reported from neutron - scattering studies.@xcite    this study therefore complements earlier works on the disordered hubbard model where other aspects have been studied , such as the metal - insulator transition,@xcite local - moment formation,@xcite phase diagram etc .",

    "magnon softening , enhancement in transverse spin fluctuation due to spin vacancies , and robustness of the gapless af state are discussed .",
    "conclusions are given in section vii .",
    "in this section we examine the formation of disorder - induced states within the hubbard gap , which reduce the charge gap , and determine the critical disorder strength at which the gap vanishes .",
    "we use the t - matrix approach and a numerical uhf approach , described in subsections a and b respectively .",
    "the t - matrix approach is exact for a single impurity , and has been used earlier to study the formation of defect states within the gap due to a single nonmagnetic impurity in the hubbard af.@xcite in order to use this approach for the disordered af , with random potentials on _ every site _ , we make a _ local approximation _ in which we consider a single site , and treat the random potential @xmath19 on this site as an impurity potential .",
    "comparison with results of the numerical uhf analysis , in which disorder is treated exactly , indicates that this approximation actually works quite well , particularly in the strong correlation limit , where states are strongly localized .",
    "spin fluctuation processes will lead to small changes in the energy gap of order @xmath28 in the strong correlation limit .      within this approach",
    "the location of impurity - induced states is obtained from the pole in the t - matrix , @xmath29_{ii})$ ] , where @xmath30_{ii}$ ] is the local host green s function . for the pure af it is given ( in the hfa ) by , @xmath31_{ii }",

    "are formed deeper in the hubbard gap , and when states have approached from both sides in the middle of the hubbard gap , the energy gap vanishes .",

    "thus , with decreasing interaction strength the ratio @xmath53 actually _",
    "increases_. this is because the kinetic energy becomes relatively important with decreasing interaction strength , and the bandwidth starts competing with disorder strength .      in order to check the validity of the t - matrix approximation ,",

    "this approach has been described earlier in the context of hole / impurity doping in the hubbard antiferromagnet.@xcite the energy gap is obtained from the energy difference between the lowest energy state of the upper hubbard band and the highest energy state of the lower hubbard band .",
    "configuration averaging is performed over 100 different realizations of the random on - site potentials on a @xmath54 lattice .",
    "the reduction in energy gap with disorder strength using this method is also shown in fig .",
    "2 . the numerical analysis shows a saturation of the energy difference at @xmath55 due to finite system size .",
    "deviations from the t - matrix approach are more pronounced at lower interaction strengths where the fermion states are more extended .",
    "the almost linear reduction of energy gap with disorder is also seen at finite temperatures , as shown in fig .",
    "the critical disorder strength decreases rapidly with increasing temperature .",
    "magnons are the low - energy excitations associated with transverse spin fluctuations in the broken - symmetry state of systems possessing continuous spin - rotational symmetry . therefore they play an important role in several macroscopic properties such as the temperature - dependence of the order parameter , nel temperature , specific heat , etc .",
    "we therefore consider the magnon propagator and obtain the disorder - induced renormalizations in magnon energies , transverse spin correlations , and the quantum spin - fluctuation correction to sublattice magnetization .",

    "thus at @xmath85 the form of the magnon propagator remains unchanged , and there is only a momentum - independent multiplicative renormalization of magnon energies , leading to an effective stiffening of the magnon modes by disorder .",
    "an upward shift of the magnon band in the strong - correlation and weak - disorder limit has also been observed in a numerical rpa study in three dimensions.@xcite    this effective enhancement of the magnon energy scale can also be viewed as resulting from the enhancement in the configuration - averaged nn exchange energy @xmath86 which , to second order in @xmath26 , is @xmath87 . to the extent that the finite - temperature reduction in sublattice magnetization due to thermal excitation of magnons is suppressed by this enhancement , the disordered af exhibits a _ slower _",

    "similar effects are also seen in the magnon velocity , @xmath175 in the limit @xmath176 , which also shows a peak structure.@xcite for this purpose we have considered the low - energy magnon modes on a @xmath54 lattice .",
    "magnon energies in the rpa are obtained by exact diagonalization of the @xmath177 matrix , evaluated in the self - consistent state using the numerical uhf approach.@xcite the low - energy modes are four - fold degenerate for the pure af on a square lattice , and therefore the normalized magnon velocity is obtained by averaging @xmath178 over the four lowest energy modes . the normalized magnon velocity , configuration - averaged over 20 different configurations , is shown in fig . 5 , for several values of @xmath174 .",
    "for strong coupling , the magnon velocity increases with disorder , almost quadratically , in agreement with the perturbative result from eq .",
    "the behavior is reversed for weak coupling , and the magnon velocity decreases with disorder strength . as the temperature - dependence of the sublattice magnetization in the low - temperature limit depends only on the energy scale of low - energy magnon modes , this also implies slower ( faster ) temperature - falloff of @xmath179 in the strong ( weak ) coupling limit .",
    "we have seen earlier that with increasing disorder strength , the energy gap decreases almost linearly with @xmath21 , and eventually closes when @xmath2 .",
    "therefore for @xmath180 , assuming a single - occupancy constraint , the two hubbard bands would overlap , indicating that single occupancy for all sites is no longer energetically favorable .",
    "electrons from the highest - energy sites ( with @xmath181 ) are transferred to the lowest - energy sites ( with @xmath182 ) , making them doubly occupied and shifting up the energy by @xmath22 .",
    "the electronic states associated with these essentially empty and doubly occupied sites are therefore located near the fermi energy at @xmath183 .",
    "as these unoccupied and doubly occupied sites are nonmagnetic , the sublattice magnetization starts falling relatively rapidly with disorder strength . in the limit @xmath184 the bands are nearly flat with bandwidth @xmath185 , and the overlap region is @xmath186 , so that a simple estimate for the fraction of these nonmagnetic sites yields @xmath187 indicating an almost linear decrease in sublattice magnetization for @xmath2 .",
    "thus a crossover takes place at @xmath2 from the essentially flat sublattice magnetization to an almost linear falloff with disorder .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "6 where the configuration - averaged sublattice magnetization obtained within the uhf approximation is plotted against the disorder strength @xmath21 .    however , a more significant consequence of the formation of these nonmagnetic sites is that they essentially act like _ spin vacancies _ in the antiferromagnet , which leads to spin - dilution behavior , as discussed in the following subsection .",
    "the above picture suggests that for @xmath180 the system can be viewed as a composite of a disordered af with @xmath188 , and a spin - diluted system with a concentration @xmath189 of spin vacancies .",
    "strong magnon scattering off static vacancies , leading to substantial softening of low - energy , long - wavelength modes and magnon damping has been obtained earlier.@xcite the ratio of magnon damping term to its energy now goes like @xmath190 , to be contrasted with the small damping ratio @xmath191 in the weak - disorder regime , obtained earlier in section iv .",
    "vacancy - induced enhancement in transverse spin fluctuation has not been studied , and we discuss this in the following subsection .",
    "we present a simple estimate of the enhancement of transverse spin fluctuations due to spin vacancies .",
    "we consider the following hubbard hamiltonian on a square lattice with binary - distributed , random nn hopping , @xmath192 where the hopping term @xmath193 if sites @xmath32 or @xmath107 are vacancy sites , and @xmath194 otherwise .",
    "thus for a vacancy on site @xmath32 , all hopping terms @xmath195 connecting @xmath32 to its nn sites @xmath74 are set to zero .",
    "the vacancy site is thus completely decoupled from the system .",
    "half - filling is retained by having one fermion per remaining site .",
    "we consider the @xmath196 limit , where the local moments are fully saturated , and the model maps to the localized - spin heisenberg model . in this limit",
    "the vacancy problem becomes identical to the spin vacancy problem in the qhaf , for which magnon renormalization was studied earlier.@xcite    the structure of the @xmath177 matrix in the host af , and the modification introduced by spin vacancies has been considered earlier in the context of static impurities.@xcite since the vacancy spin is completely decoupled from the system , the magnitude of the diagonal matrix element @xmath197_{ii}$ ] on the vacancy site @xmath32 is irrelevant . to minimize the perturbation",
    ", we treat the vacancy site as occupied with an isolated spin . for a vacancy on site @xmath32",
    ", a perturbation is induced in the neighborhood due to the absence of hopping between vacancy site and nn sites @xmath74 . in terms of the notation used in section iii ,",
    "the following self energy correction @xmath198 is obtained @xmath199 where again @xmath171 has been set to 1 .",
    "thus , a diagonal contribution @xmath200 arises if a vacancy exists either on site @xmath32 , or on any of the four nn sites @xmath74 . for a finite vacancy concentration @xmath17 ,",
    "the probability that a vacancy exists on a site is @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , configuration - averaging yields @xmath201 , and @xmath202 . from eq .",
    "( 4 ) we obtain the same expression for the magnon propagator as in eq . ( 6 ) , except that now @xmath203 , so that @xmath204 yields a softening of the magnon mode , reflecting the spin - dilution behavior.@xcite this magnon softening is in contrast to the stiffening in the weak - disorder regime , obtained earlier in section iii",
    ". enhanced thermal excitation of magnons due to this softening will result in a faster temperature falloff of the sublattice magnetization , and hence to a lowering of the nel temperature .",
    "since the form of the magnon propagator is not changed , as already discussed in section iii , the transverse spin correlations @xmath91 and @xmath92 , as well as the lattice - averaged spin - fluctuation correction to sublattice magnetization remain unchanged .",
    "therefore , from the swt result given after eq .",

    "this results in a nearly vanishing @xmath209 term in @xmath210 , in agreement with the perturbative result obtained above .",
    "the lattice - averaged sublattice magnetization for the disordered af , obtained by accounting for the quantum spin - fluctuation correction using @xmath211 , with @xmath212 , where the vacancy concentration @xmath189 for @xmath180 , is compared with the hf result in fig",
    "the crossover at @xmath2 is again clearly seen from the rapid decrease in sublattice magnetization .",
    "the above result indicates that substantial af ordering remains even for @xmath2 , where the energy gap closes . since af order persists for @xmath180 the gapless af state",
    "is apparently quite robust even in two dimensions .",
    "this feature was also observed in the qmc study in @xmath213,@xcite where substantial af correlations were seen for @xmath214 , while the compressibility indicated an absence of the charge gap .",
    "this leads to the possibility , in three dimensions , of a metallic af state , if states at fermi energy are not localized .",
    "gapless af states , both metallic and insulating , were also obtained for the three - dimensional disordered hubbard model , the phase    diagram of which has been recently studied within the uhf approach.@xcite a region of metallic af state in @xmath215 was also recently identified in the @xmath216-hubbard model without disorder ; here it is the nnn hopping amplitude @xmath217 that leads to frustration of af order.@xcite    the robustness of the gapless af state is also seen from a dmft calculation of the nel temperature @xmath173 , for a rectangular distribution of @xmath19 , as obtained from an extrapolation to zero of the inverse af susceptibility .",
    "both exact enumeration and monte carlo evaluation were employed .",
    "details of the application of dmft to the disordered hubbard model have been described earlier,@xcite where binary alloy and semicircular distributions were studied .",
    "the variation of @xmath173 with @xmath21 is shown in fig . 7 for @xmath218 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath219 in the two - dimensional case .",
    "appreciable spin ordering is evident from the fairly high @xmath173 even at @xmath220 where the energy gap vanishes . within the dmft , this closing of the energy gap with disorder , in the low - temperature ordered state",
    "is seen in fig . 8 from the single - particle density of states @xmath161 , which was obtained by analytically continuing the imaginary - time green s function using the maximum entropy procedure.@xcite",
    "as expected for weak and intermediate couplings , @xmath173 is seen to decrease with disorder strength , in contrast to the strong - coupling result of an enhancement in the magnon energy scale , and hence in @xmath173 .",
    "also , the critical disorder strength where @xmath173 vanishes is seen to be nearly @xmath221 , which is intermediate between the critical values of nearly @xmath222 for the milder semicircular distribution and nearly @xmath22 for the much more severe binary distribution.@xcite in fact , for the binary alloy case , the zero - temperature transition is expected to occur at @xmath223 , when all sites abruptly become either unoccupied or doubly occupied and the sublattice magnetization vanishes .",
    "two fundamentally different mechanisms  disorder - enhanced delocalization and local - moment quenching  were identified to control the magnetic behavior of an af in the regimes of weak and strong disorder , respectively . in the weak disorder regime ( @xmath224 ) disorder effects on sublattice magnetization , magnon - mode energies , and nel temperature",
    "can be qualitatively understood within the disorder - enhanced delocalization effect .",
    "the _ stabilization _ of the nel state by disorder in the strong correlation limit , reflected in an _ enhancement _ of the magnon energy scale and the nel temperature , is a striking consequence . in this regime",
    "the af state is remarkably robust against disorder , particularly in the strong correlation limit .",
    "low - energy , long - wavelength magnon modes are weakly damped , and continue to be well - defined excitations .    with increasing disorder strength there is a crossover at @xmath2 , characterized by a rapid decrease in sublattice magnetization and quenching of local moments due to formation of nonmagnetic sites . driven by band overlap , this local - moment quenching can be viewed as the reverse of local - moment formation in the disordered metallic state with increasing @xmath225 .",
    "these nonmagnetic sites act like spin vacancies in the antiferromagnet , leading to characteristic spin - dilution behavior .",
    "vacancy - induced magnon scattering results in enhanced transverse spin fluctuations , softened magnon modes , lowering of nel temperature , and strong magnon damping .    as discussed in section",
    "vi , in the gapless af state for @xmath226 , the electronic states near the fermi energy are associated with ( and localized around ) the essentially empty and doubly occupied sites .",
    "these states are nonmagnetic in that they do not contribute significantly to local moments .",
    "therefore it is interesting to note that the low - frequency conductivity behavior involves these nonmagnetic states near the fermi energy .",
    "further investigation of the gapless af state , focussing on the low - frequency conductivity behavior , magnon damping due to decay into particle - hole excitations , and an estimation of the critical disorder strength where aflro is destroyed , is presently in progress.@xcite",
    "one of us ( a.s . ) gratefully acknowledges support from the alexander von humboldt foundation through a research fellowship .",
    "in this appendix we treat the disorder term @xmath227 in the hamiltonian as a perturbation and obtain disorder corrections in the broken - symmetry state up to second order in @xmath26 . with @xmath228 representing the one - electron hf green s function in the pure af , the corresponding green s function for the disordered af , @xmath229 $ ] , then yields disorder corrections to electronic densities and sublattice magnetization .",
    "similarly , the magnon renormalization within rpa is obtained from the correction @xmath230 in the zeroth - order antiparallel - spin particle - hole propagator defined below eq .",
    "( 4 ) . for analytic convenience",
    "we consider the strong - correlation limit and retain terms of order @xmath49 only , at which level the pure af is equivalent to the nn heisenberg model . up to this order the green s function @xmath231_{ij}$ ] in site - basis has only diagonal , nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) matrix elements .",
    "only the former two are actually required in the strong - coupling analysis , and are given below for spin up and site @xmath32 in the a sublattice .",
    "expressions for other spin and sublattice cases follow from the spin - sublattice symmetry .",
    "these green s functions are easily obtained by starting with the atomic limit , where the bands are at energies @xmath232 and @xmath35 , with @xmath233 , and then obtaining corrections up to second order in the hopping term @xmath234 .",

    "diagrams in which the potential scattering is interband ( involving different hubbard bands ) result in transfer of spectral weight across the hubbard bands , and therefore yield density changes .",
    "however , the intraband processes ( involving all propagators from the same band ) represent energy renormalization due to disorder potential , and do not contribute to any density change . in the particle - hole propagator @xmath236 , while both energy and density renormalizations need to be considered , diagrams involving only energy renormalization do not contribute as both the particle and hole energies are shifted identically by the disorder potential .",

    "the net probability of escape changes from @xmath49 to @xmath241 , which to first order in @xmath242 precisely yields the above result .    from the particle - hole symmetry with spin flip in the hubbard antiferromagnet,@xcite the spin - down hole experiences the same effect , except that the potentials are reversed for the hole .",
    "therefore , there is an _ increase _ of identical magnitude in the spin - down hole density , implying an identical decrease in the spin - down particle density .",
    "this leads to a vanishing change in the local magnetization @xmath243 , and the particle - hole propagator @xmath236 .",
    "this cancellation would be absent if the random potential was spin - dependent , and is connected to the time - reversal symmetry .",

    "the changes in spin - up and spin - down electronic densities are therefore equal and opposite , and hence the change in local magnetization adds up to , @xmath248    this result also follows from the second - order correction to the net escape probability , discussed earlier below eq .",
