    "the much acclaimed successes of the @xmath0cdm cosmology in matching many observations concern essentially its homogeneous limit and the linear regime in which perturbations to homogeneity are small .",
    "the success of the model in accounting for the numerous observations which probe the non - linear regime , where density fluctuations are large , is much more uncertain .",
    "an important consideration in this respect is the great difficulty of calculating the model s predictions in this regime . even in the idealized limit in which clustering arises from gravity alone",
    ", predictions reside solely on numerical simulations .",
    "the latter have , despite impressive increases in their size and sophistication , still quite limited spatial resolution .",
    "further , essentially because there are no non - trivial analytical benchmarks which they can be tested against , it remains unclear to what extent their results are conditioned by these resolution limits . in this paper",
    "we explore what might be learnt about the nature of non - linear gravitational clustering from the study of a class of one dimensional ( 1d ) models , which have the interest of offering , even with modest computer resources , very much greater spatial resolution and exact numerical integration . an early study in this spirit",
    "is that of @xcite which used such a 1d model to explore clustering in hot dark matter cosmologies . @xcite",
    "derived and studied a slightly different model to the most naive 1d version of clustering in an einstein de sitter ( eds ) universe considered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have studied the version without expansion , while miller et al .",
    "@xcite have reported results on all three of these models . despite these studies",
    "it remains unclear , however , whether a good , and really useful , analogy can be made with 3d cosmological simulations . generalizing the results of @xcite and @xcite , we confirm here the very strong qualitative similarities in the temporal development of clustering to that in the 3d case .",
    "further we show the scale invariant properties of the clustering in real space , emphasized and analyzed by @xcite , can in fact",
    "be well explained within an analytical framework similar to one proposed long ago for the 3d case @xcite .",
    "we derive the appropriate 1d version of this generalized  stable clustering \" prediction for the correlation exponents , and show it to provide a very good approximation to the numerical results .",
    "we also show that , in a precise sense , the strongly non - linear clustering can be properly described as a _",
    "fractal hierarchy , in line with what was originally anticipated qualitatively in three dimensions .",
    "we argue finally for the extrapolation of these conclusions about the qualitative nature of clustering to the relevant 3d case , and consider its implications , in particular for what concerns the nature and properties of  halos \" in cold dark matter cosmologies .",
    "dissipationless cosmological n - body simulations ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) solve numerically the equations @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the comoving particle coordinates , @xmath3 is the appropriate scale factor for the cosmology considered , with hubble constant @xmath4 . the superscript",
    "` j ' in the sum , which runs in practice over the infinite system constituted by periodic copies of a cube containing @xmath5 particles , indicates that the ( badly defined ) contribution of the mean mass density ( which sources the hubble expansion ) is subtracted .",
    "we consider here simply the 1d system obtained by replacing the 3d newtonian force term by the analogous 1d expression , derived starting from the 1d poisson equation which gives a force between particles in one dimension ( or , equivalently , infinite parallel sheets embedded in three dimensions ) independent of separation .",
    "we thus consider the equations @xmath6 where the limiting procedure used in the sum is simply a convenient way to explicit the subtraction of the background @xcite , and @xmath7 is the coupling constant ( with @xmath8 for sheets of surface mass density @xmath9 ) .",
    "initial conditions are generated , just as in 3d cosmological simulations , by applying appropriate small perturbations to particles initially on an infinite perfect lattice .",
    "if the displacement from its initial lattice site of particle @xmath10 is @xmath11 it can be shown rigorously @xcite that the net force on the particle , until it crosses another one , is exactly proportional to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the average displacement .",
    "the equations of motion up to the time at which particles cross become @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean particle density ( and we take @xmath16 ) .",
    "when the _ particles _ in our model cross one another the force changes simply by @xmath17 .",
    "however , since in 1d a crossing of particles is equivalent , up to exchange of labels , to an elastic  collision \" between them , one can instead consider ( as we are not interested in the labels of the particles ) a system of particles which bounce elastically and follow eq  ( [ 1d - equation - u ] ) _ at all times _ between  collisions \" .",
    "finally , by a transformation of the time coordinate to @xmath18 , and appropriate choice of units of @xmath19 , we can rewrite these equations as @xmath20 i.e. , as those of a set of damped inverted harmonic oscillators .",
    "we note that these equations coincide simply with those for displacements of _ fluid _ elements in the zeldovich approximation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , which is in fact exact up to  shell crossing \" for 1d perturbations .",
    "the same system can thus be derived as a simple analytical continuation of this approximation at shell crossing @xcite .    for a generic cosmology @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ 1d - equation - u - final ] ) is a non - trivial function of @xmath19 , but in the specific case of an eds cosmology ( for which @xmath22 ) it is a constant , @xmath23 ( and @xmath24 ) .",
    "the model derived and studied by @xcite corresponds instead to the case @xmath25 , while the case @xmath26 ( i.e. static limit ) has also been studied by several authors ( see references given above ) .",
    "we note that , despite the fact that we obtained the value @xmath23 above , this is not necessarily _ the _ more appropriate value to consider for our study : in the derivation just given the 3d hubble law has been imposed _ by hand_. this has been done because the 1d hubble law ( which would arise if one follows fully the analogy with the 3d derivation starting from physical coordinates ) gives a completely different qualitative behavior  collapse in a finite time  which has no relevance to 3d cosmology . thus in order to  mimic \" eds cosmology , one could equally take the functional form of the corresponding hubble law , but leave its normalization as a free parameter .",
    "this leads to the eqs .",
    "( [ 1d - equation - u - final ] ) with @xmath21 an undetermined constant .",
    "these equations then simply define a simple class of toy models , which may be useful for _ qualitative _ understanding of the 3d problem .    given initial displacements and velocities , eqs .",
    "( [ 1d - equation - u - final ] ) can trivially be integrated exactly between particle collisions when @xmath21 is a constant . to determine the time of the next collision ( and which pair of particles it involves ) requires then only the solution of algebraic equations .",
    "the numerical integration can therefore be performed ",
    "exactly \" , i.e. , up to machine precision .",
    "as described by @xcite the integration can be sped up optimally using a  heap \" structure .",
    "all the results presented here are for systems with @xmath27 particles ( and periodic boundary conditions ) .    in making the analogy with 3d simulations , which aim to reproduce the _ collisionless _ limit of gravitational clustering and include a smoothing of the singularity in the 3d newtonian force for this reason , it is to be noted that , on the time scales we will consider , these 1d systems , without force smoothing , can be expected to represent extremely well this limit .",
    "studies of collisional relaxation in finite 1d self - gravitating systems ( see @xcite , and references therein ) have shown that it is very suppressed compared to that in 3d systems , a typical relaxation time for a virialized system of number density @xmath28 being @xmath29 . using this estimate in the simulations reported below , it is simple to show that even the relaxation time for the smallest and densest clusters is much longer than the duration of the simulation .",
    "the reason for this relative suppression of this relaxation is that , in one dimension , there is no analogy to 3d 2-body relaxation : the  collisions \" of particles we have discussed above do not contribute to the usual collision term in the boltzmann equation .",
    "indeed it is for this reason that particle crossings and  collisions \" are equivalent .",
    "various studies ( see references above ) of these models starting from close to uniform initial conditions have noted the striking qualitative similarity of the clustering to that in three dimensions : one observes the formation of structures ( i.e. overdense regions ) first at small scales and then at ever larger scales .",
    "let us consider first more closely the temporal character of this evolution .",
    "it is canonical and instructive in the study of cold dark matter clustering in the universe to consider evolution from initial conditions characterized by power spectrum ( ps ) @xmath30 ( with @xmath28 a constant ) , and velocities prescribed by the growing mode of linear perturbation theory .",
    "although the  real \" cosmological power spectrum ( in currently favoured _ cold _ dark matter models ) is not exactly power - law it may be well approximated as such , with a slowly varying exponent , between @xmath31 and @xmath32 over the relevant range ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the simulation of such  scale - free \" initial conditions is expected to give rise to simple behaviours ( which one might hope to understand analytically ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the spatial dimension ) one expects theoretically @xcite a process of hierachical structure formation which    * is driven by linear amplification of the initial fluctuations .",
    "for power law initial conditions and the models we are considering , it is simple to show that this corresponds to the scale of non - linearity ( at which perturbations are of order one ) which grows in proportion to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the root of the characteristic equation of eq .",
    "( [ 1d - equation - u ] ) associated to the growing mode of linear theory ; * tends asymptotically to  self - similar \" behaviour in the whole non - linear regime , i.e. , the temporal evolution of all correlation properties can be obtained by a rescaling of the spatial coordinates , in proportion to the same function @xmath37 .",
    "extending analyses in @xcite and in @xcite we have studied a range of values of initial ps ( @xmath38 ) and models ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ cf_ps_k2_quintic ] shows the measured reduced two point correlation function @xmath40 as a function of @xmath41 , while the lower panel shows the ( dimensionless ) @xmath42 as a function of @xmath43 , for the case of an initial ps with @xmath44 and a model with @xmath45 .",
    "the superposition of the rescaled ps at small @xmath46 in the lower panel shows the validity of linear theory , while the superposition in the same plot at larger @xmath46 , and of @xmath47 in the upper panel over a wide range , shows the development of the corresponding self - similarity in the non - linear regime .",
    "we observed the same behaviours in all cases , except for @xmath48 . in the latter case",
    "it turns out that , as expected , linear theory breaks down at small @xmath46 , but nevertheless self - similarity is observed in the non - linear regime .    in three dimensions",
    "such self - similar behaviour has been observed numerically to apply in all cases which have been simulated . specifically in eds",
    "universes it has been shown to apply in the range @xmath49 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while in the static universe limit it has been shown to apply for @xmath50 and @xmath44 @xcite . as in all these 3d cases ,",
    "a good power - law fit can be obtained ( as in fig .",
    "[ cf_ps_k2_quintic ] ) to the correlation function , @xmath51 , and to the power spectrum ( @xmath52 ) in the range of non - linear self - similar clustering .",
    "the exponents @xmath53 we measure in our 1d simulations , which are reported below in further detail , show the same qualitative dependence on @xmath28 as in 3d : in the expanding case @xmath53 increases as @xmath28 does so ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while in the static case one observes a much smaller exponent which does not depend sensibly on @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "compared to 3d the power law behaviours we observe in the 1d models extend over a much larger range of scales , simply because of the much greater dynamical range accessible . in fig .",
    "[ cf_ps_k2_quintic ] , for example , such behaviour extends over roughly four decades in scale , compared to a single decade in 3d studies ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". such spatial resolution makes it possible to robustly determine whether such behaviour is indicative of scale invariant ( i.e. fractal - type ) properties in the distributions , using tools such as box - counting methods to measure the spectrum of  generalized dimensions \" ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in a recent study of these 1d models with initial conditions like those we are studying here , @xcite",
    "have used such methods to analyze this clustering and have shown that , like in their previous studies of slightly different initial conditions in @xcite , they indeed find clear evidence for scaling behaviours indicative of fractal clustering in this regime .",
    "we have performed much of the same analysis on our simulations , and find results very consistent with those reported in @xcite : robustly measured  generalized dimensions \" in the range of scales where the power law behaviour in the correlation function indicates scale invariance , and in particular a value of the  correlation dimension \" @xmath54 as expected .",
    "we show now that the exponent @xmath53 measured from @xmath40 can be very well accounted for , in the expanding models , using both the self - similarity of the evolution in time , and directly observable `` stable clustering '' behaviour in the system at sufficiently small scales .",
    "to do so let us consider the temporal evolution of the lower cut - off , @xmath55 say , at which the self - similar scaling breaks down . just as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cf_ps_k2_quintic ] we observe in all our simulations that @xmath40 breaks from the power - law at this scale and become approximately flat , reaching a maximum value @xmath56 .",

    "further we observe that the upper cut - off to power - law behaviour in the correlation function , @xmath60 , occurs ( as in three dimensions ) at a fixed amplitude in @xmath61 slightly larger than unity , i.e. , roughly at the non - linearity scale [ defined by @xmath62 .",
    "we therefore have , from self - similarity , that @xmath63 .",

    "the relation ( [ xmin - ximax ] ) indicates the relevance of  stable clustering \" : if the correlation _ up to this scale _ @xmath55 arises from structures which do not evolve ( macroscopically ) when considered in spatial coordinates rescaled in proportion to @xmath55 , one obtains such a behaviour . in three dimensions such",
    "a behaviour has been proposed long ago @xcite as possibly valid _ in the strongly non - linear regime _ , and used to obtain a prediction for the exponent @xmath53 in an eds universe .",
    "it amounts to supposing that if non - linear structures behave essentially as isolated systems ( i.e. if the tidal forces exerted by all mass external to them are negligible ) , they will be expected to virialize and remain stable in _ physical _ coordinates . in the 1d models we are considering the equations of motion",

    " stable clustering \" nevertheless has a clear meaning . indeed in the 1d model the meaning of  isolation \" of a subsystem may be given more exactly than in 3d : if particles of a given subsystem do no cross particles outside the system , the corresponding system indeed evolves independently from the rest of the  universe \" ( i.e. tidal gravitational forces vanish in 1d ) . to see what evolution",
    "is then predicted , it is appropriate to rewrite the equations of motion for such a finite isolated subsystem using the particle labelling in which particles pass through one another .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the equation of motion for particles belonging to such a subsystem may then be written ( in the units we have adopted in which @xmath65 ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the position of the particle @xmath10 _ with respect to the centre of mass of the system _ , and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is the number of particles ( in the subsystem ) on the right ( left ) of the particle @xmath10 .",
    "unsurprisingly this is just the equation of motion for a _ finite _ 1d self - gravitating system in an infinite space , with an additional damping term arising from the expansion and a term from the subtracted mean density .",
    "we can define the conserved energy @xmath70 associated with the two terms on the right hand side , and have then @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the total kinetic energy , and @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "now , if such an isolated subsystem is significantly _ overdense _",
    "( i.e. its mean density @xmath76 is much greater than @xmath15 ) , the time scale associated with the dynamics of the first term on the right hand side @xmath77 is much shorter than that associated with the other two terms , and the term @xmath78 is negligible compared to @xmath79 .",
    "we expect this to allow the use of an adiabatic approximation to ( [ energy - equation ] ) , in which @xmath70 and @xmath72 are replaced by their values averaged on this shorter time scale , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . on these time scales , however , we expect the corresponding virial relation to apply , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
    "it follows that @xmath83 , and then , using eq .",
    "( [ energy - equation ] ) , that @xmath84 given that @xmath79 is linearly proportional to the size of the subsystem , the size of such a virialized subsystem will be expected to scale in the same way .",
    "thus , if the behaviour in ( [ xmin - ximax ] ) is indeed due to such stable virialized structures , @xmath85 . substituting this relation in ( [ gamma - epsilon ] ) gives @xmath86 we note that , using the above arguments , a straightforward generalization of the usual 3d stable clustering prediction ( for an eds cosmology ) to the class of cosmological backgrounds corresponding to any ( constant ) @xmath21 may be obtained .",

    "the agreement is excellent for the expanding cases , and indeed in these cases the value @xmath59 measured directly agrees well with the predicted @xmath92   our measured exponents agree with those reported by @xcite .",
    "our stable clustering result @xmath92 explains also the exponent measured by @xcite directly for an isolated structure . ] . in the static case",
    "the prediction leads to the badly defined result @xmath93 , while we observe a small exponent @xmath94 which does not appear to depend on @xmath28 .",
    "we observe in this case that , rather than ( [ xmin - ximax ] ) , we have an @xmath55 which remains approximately constant ( i.e. the expected @xmath26 limit ) , but a @xmath56 which grows . clearly the stable clustering hypothesis is indeed only an approximation , to which corrections ( due to the fact that structures are not , of course , strictly isolated ) become most important , as one would expect , when we go to the limit @xmath95 in which virialized structures no longer decrease in size .",
    "let us now consider the observed clustering in terms of  halos \" , in analogy to how this is done in cosmological simulations .",
    "we thus use a friend - of - friend algorithm , with a variable linking length @xmath0 ( which we define in units of the initial lattice spacing @xmath96 ) . in 1d",
    "this is equivalent to separating the system into structures separated by voids of size greater than or equal to @xmath0 . in the range of scale - invariant non - linear clustering ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath97 , we observe that the algorithm selects out structures with a broad range of sizes from our simulations , peaked around a value which scales with @xmath0 .",
    "however , the fact that the distribution of sizes is quite large , while the range of scale invariance in any simulation is of course quite limited , make it difficult ( even in 1d ) to use such halos as a tool for characterizing this regime .",
    "we thus analyse here the case of an initial ps with @xmath48 in which this range is greatest  a little more than four orders of magnitude in scale between @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the most evolved configuration .    shown in fig .",
    "[ virial_ratio ] is the measured distribution of virial ratio as a function of @xmath0 in this simulation , i.e. the distribution of the values of the ratio @xmath100 measured directly in each halo , taking the velocities with respect to the centre of mass of the corresponding halo .",
    "we observe an approximately stable distribution _ peaked about unity _ in the range of @xmath0 where the structures selected out fall mostly in the length scales of scale invariance , while at the smallest scales no such tendency is observed . on the contrary the virial ratio tends to be very large , which can be interpreted as due to the fact that the algorithm is selecting structures inside the scale @xmath55 : if the distribution at this scale is constituted of approximately smooth virialized structures of size @xmath55 , parts of these structures will have a high virial ratio ( because @xmath72 scales more slowly with size than @xmath79 in a smooth structure ) .",
    "we have studied quantitatively the stability of these measured distributions in the range of scale invariant clustering using a nonparametric kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test .",
    "the k - s statistic quantifies a distance between the empirical distribution functions of the different samples , and the null distribution is calculated under the null hypothesis that the samples are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "calculating the corresponding @xmath101-values of this test , we find that the null hypothesis is indeed not rejected in the range of scale - invariance , while , on the other hand , it is clearly rejected outside this range .",
    "our interpretation of these results is that one can effectively decompose the distribution into a collection of structures which are , approximately , virialized .",
    "this is true provided these structures are defined at any scale in the range of scale - invariant clustering .",
    "_ in three dimensions _ the stable clustering hypothesis has been used widely as a reference point , and indeed much used phenomenological models such as the formalism proposed by @xcite incorporate it into the modeling of the non - linear power spectrum obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "however , in parallel , results of major simulations of power law initial conditions ( e.g. @xcite ) led to the conclusion that , although the measured exponents in the correlation function showed a behaviour roughly consistent with its predictions ( albeit with some significant deviations @xcite ) , there was no evidence for the  clustering hierarchy \" which peebles had argued would be associated with it ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , notably , explicitly excluded such a  fractal \" description and found evidence instead for the validity of a description in terms of  smooth non - linear clumps \" .",
    "these latter are the precursors of the  halos \" of halo models , which have become the standard phenomenological description of the matter distribution in cold dark matter cosmologies ( for a review , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the matter distribution is then approximated as a collection of isolated ( and thus virialized ) spherical structures with smooth density profiles .",
    "further , on the basis of extensive numerical study following that of @xcite , the latter are widely believed to be characterized well by ",
    "universal \" exponents ( i.e. independent of initial conditions and cosmology ) .    _ in one dimension _ the strongly non - linear regime is truly scale - invariant ( for power law initial conditions ) in a range which grows monotonically in time",
    ". the associated distribution of matter is _ intrinsically _ lumpy or grainy down to the lower cut - off scale @xmath55 : indeed the very meaning of such _ scale invariance _ is that there are no characteristic scales available to define smoothness . to illustrate this we show in fig .",
    "[ zoom_density_fractal ] the spatial density at various levels of detail in a typical evolved configuration .",
    "such distributions are most naturally described with the instruments of fractal ( or , more generally , multi - fractal ) analysis developed for this purpose in condensed matter and statistical physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as we have just illustrated in the previous section , halo type descriptions may , of course , also be employed to describe them .",
    "the halos so defined are , however , very different to those described by 3d halo models : these 1d halos are not smooth .",
    "further have they no intrinsic size themselves , but are defined only with reference to an arbitrary chosen scale .",
    "the study of the virial ratios we have presented indicates , however , that such halos can be considered as entities with a dynamical relevance , as they show a clear tendency to have a virial ratio of order unity ( which is the behaviour of an isolated structure ) .",
    "the clustering in the non - linear regime can thus be considered as a concrete realization of the qualitative picture of a  clustering hierarchy \" originally envisaged by peebles ( e.g. @xcite ) as resulting from stable clustering .",
    "the stable clustering hypothesis we have described above , however , is actually subtly different from the original one : we assumed only that stable clustering applies below the scale @xmath55 marking the lower cut - off to the scale invariance , and not necessarily to the strongly non - linear regime as a whole .",
    "thus we assumed only that stable clustering applies at an ultraviolet scale _ fixed by the resolution of the simulation _ ( or , physically , by the scale at which the very first structures form ) .",
    "the  statistical virialization \" we have observed using the halo analysis , on the other hand , applies at scales above @xmath55 and across the range of the scale invariant clustering .",
    "* a. these 1d models produce non - linear clustering which is qualitatively different in its nature to that in 3d , or * b. the spatial resolution in 3d simulations up to now has been too limited to reveal the nature of clustering in cold dark matter cosmologies , which is correctly reflected ( qualitatively ) in the 1d simulations .",
    "we believe that , despite the impressive computational size and sophistication of 3d cosmological simulations , conclusion b may well be the correct one .",
    "the very largest modern studies in a cosmological volume access roughly two decades in scale in the non - linear regime cosmology , has , at redshift zero , @xmath102 at about @xmath103h@xmath104mpc , an initial mean interparticle @xmath105h@xmath104 kpc and a force smoothing @xmath106h@xmath104 kpc .",
    "it is usually supposed that it is the latter which sets the lower bound on resolution , but we note that it has been shown by several studies ( see @xcite ) that , at the very least , precision may be compromised below the scale @xmath96 . ] while reference studies in the literature of power law initial conditions in eds cosmology @xcite measure the crucial power - law behaviour in the correlation function ( or the ps ) over at most one decade .",
    "if we were to perform our 1d simulations at comparable resolution to large cosmological simulations like @xcite , we would certainly have great difficulty in establishing the scale - invariant nature of the strongly non - linear clustering arising from power law initial conditions .",
    "although halos defined exactly as in three dimensions might look clumpy , an approximately smooth profile could be determined for them if they were averaged ( as they can be in three dimensions when spherical symmetry is assumed ) .",
    "higher resolution 3d simulations of smaller regions have shown over the last decade that there is in fact much more substructure (  subhalos \" ) inside halos than was originally anticipated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and have even more recently described several levels of such substructure (  subhalos of subhalos \" , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite even use the term  fractal \" to describe ( qualitatively ) the real space structures , while @xcite describe the structure of halos in phase space as  intrinsically grainy \" .",
    "we note that other authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have previously argued for similar conclusions on the basis of analyses of 3d simulations .",
    "let us consider nevertheless one possible consideration in favour of ( the more conservative ) conclusion a. in the expanding ( i.e. damped ) 1d models , the stable clustering prediction ( [ gamma - sc-1d ] ) fits the measured exponents extremely well .",
    "early 3d studies for eds cosmologies ( e.g. @xcite ) measured exponents roughly consistent with the stable clustering prediction , but later studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have found significant disagreement .",
    "this disagreement is attributed to physical mechanisms which cause the fundamental assumption of stability to be violated  by the evident fact that _ there are _ interactions between  halos \" , which can even lead to their merging into single structures .",
    "we have noted that in one dimension tidal forces vanish , and structures can interact only when they actually physically cross one another . while merging may occur",
    ", it may be that it is a less efficient process than in three dimensions .",
    "thus the excellent agreement in the 1d models compared to eds may perhaps be attributed to the fact that these models probably represent poorly the role of such physical effects .",
    "the essential question , however , is not whether these effects play a role and can lead to deviations from stable clustering , but whether such effects can _ qualitatively _ change the nature of clustering , destroying scale invariance by smoothing out the distribution _ on a scale related to the upper cut - off _ to scale invariance .",
    "our study of the case @xmath26 suggests that the answer is negative .",
    "the prediction of stable clustering does not work in this case , and like in three dimensions , one obtains a small value of the exponent which does not sensibly depend on @xmath28 .",
    "the physical reasons why the exponent is close to , but different to , the stable clustering prediction are a priori the ones just cited . the analysis of miller et al .",
    "of this case , which we have rechecked and confirm , finds nevertheless that the distribution is scale invariant .",

    "widely claimed  universality \" of such exponents in halos profiles , such a hypothesis can not currently be ruled out , as the determination of such exponents is beset by numerical difficulties ( arising again from the limited resolution of numerical simulations ) . in a study of halo profiles obtained from power law initial conditions",
    "@xcite show explicitly that the results for the halo exponents depend greatly on what numerical fitting procedure is adopted . while one procedure gives",
    " universality \" ( i.e. exponents independent of @xmath28 ) , a different one favors clearly steepening inner profiles for larger @xmath28 .",

    "the exact scale invariance in the strongly non - linear regime would certainly be broken in this case , and the various characteristic scales introduced will be imprinted on the clustering . there would thus not be a single correlation exponent , but a slowly varying one .",

    "intrinsically clumpy or grainy halos lead , for example , to very different predictions for dark matter annihilation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) ) . concerning the compatibility of such a distribution of cold dark matter with observations of the distribution of visible matter at sub - galactic scales  which would be expected to lead to an amplified  missing satellite \" problem  we note that recent studies such as @xcite show that solid conclusions in this respect will be reached only on the basis of a much improved understanding of the processes involved in star formation . at larger scales",
