    "instabilities and pattern formation in buoyant flows have been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "classically , heat is applied uniformly from below @xcite and the conductive solution ( also called the basic solution ) becomes unstable for a critical vertical temperature gradient beyond a certain threshold .",
    "typically , instabilities in rayleigh - bnard convection lead to roll patterns , however spiral waves have been also reported , in both theoretical and experimental results .",
    "first experimental observations on spirals @xcite in rayleigh - bnard convection were rather surprising as they were carried out for a set of external parameter values where parallel rolls should be stable . in experiments , spirals have been reported for finite prandtl number boden2 and both single and multiarmed giant spirals and spiral chaos have been observed . in @xcite transitions between spiral and target states",
    "are reported .",
    "first theoretical studies attempting to justify spiral patterns in rayleigh bnard convection were performed just in model equations such as swift - hohenberg type equations @xcite .",
    "these results were confirmed by later simulations of the full governing equations @xcite .    a more general setup for rayleigh - bnard convection than the case of uniform heating , consists of a basic dynamic flow imposed by a non - zero horizontal temperature gradient which may be either constant or not .",
    "numerical results obtained at the former setup in an annular domain address the importance of both vertical and horizontal temperature gradients in the development of instabilities @xcite . in this work we consider a cylidrical domain with a localised gaussian - like heating at the bottom . therefore , apart from vertical and horizontal temperature gradients , a heat parameter related to the shape of the heating profile at the bottom is introduced .",
    "our results show that many different types of instabilities may appear depending on the basic flow and external parameters .",
    "we study how instabilities depend on dimensionless parameters and we recover many results as those described for the classical uniform heating case .",
    "giant single armed spiral waves appear and their instability threshold is close to those patterns refered as targets .",
    "localised and extended spirals are identified and both of them are found for finite and infinite prandtl number .",
    "moreover , stationary patterns appear both with local and extended structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "a gaussian profile is imposed , @xmath43where @xmath44 is a measure of the sharpness of the profile . in figure 2 several plots of this profile for different values of the parameters can be seen .",
    "the lateral wall is insulating , @xmath45the use of cylindrical coordinates , which are singular at @xmath6 , requires regularity conditions on velocity , pressure and temperature fields . in general , these conditions are expressed as follows @xcite@xmath46where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the unit vectors in the @xmath1 and @xmath49 directions respectively .",

    ", the problem of the spurious modes for pressure arises @xcite , which we have solved using the method proposed in @xcite , taking additional boundary conditions .",

    "we have solved numerically the stationary axisymmetric version of equations ( [ 1general]-[2general ] ) together with the boundary conditions , as explained in section 3.1 .",
    "different basic state solutions are obtained depending on the parameters .",
    "figure 3a ) displays a return flow with clearly inverted temperature gradients and a single roll on the velocity field .",
    "figure 3b ) shows a linear temperature field with no inversions on the temperature gradient and several corotative rolls .",
    "figures 3c ) and 3d ) displays intermediate states . in figure 3c ) we see a rather vertical temperature gradients with slight inversions and a slight corrotative roll .",
    "figure 3d ) displays a return flow where the outer part of the cylinder is hotter than the inner one .",
    "these basic flows become unstable to different spatial structures as we explain next .",
    "we have studied numerically the linear stability of the numerical basic states following explanations of section 3.2 .",
    "we consider the external parameter r as control parameter . by control parameter",
    "we mean the parameter that changed leads to an instability while all the others are fixed .",
    "this occurs when @xmath125 changes from a negative value to a positive one as r varies .",
    "the value of r@xmath126 for which @xmath127  is the critical value .",
    "figure 4 displays @xmath128 as a function of the wave number @xmath59 and all other parameters fixed .",
    "the eigenvalue with maximum real part corresponds to @xmath129  and as it is purely real , the bifurcation is stationary .",
    "depending on the different parameters a great variety of instabilities are obtained either stationary or oscillatory with different growing modes , which are analyzed next .      in this section",
    "we study how the shape factor @xmath44 and the temperature quotient @xmath124 both related to the bottom heat boundary condition affect to the instabilities . to start with we fix parameters @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 and",
    "take r as control parameter .",
    "figures 5a and 5b display critical values of r@xmath126 as a function of @xmath124 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively .",
    "critical wave numbers @xmath137 and the corresponding growing modes are shown in these figures where void circles correspond to stationary bifurcations while crossed ones stand for oscillatory instabilities .",
    "both figures show regions with qualitatively different behaviors which are separated by vertical lines . in figure 5a for @xmath138 and in figure 5b for @xmath139 the critical r increases when @xmath140 decreases .",
    "at the @xmath124 limit values , the r threshold tends to grow so much that we have not found it .",
    "this suggests that there is an asymptote where the critical r@xmath126 tends to infinity .",
    "as @xmath124 is increased , the control parameter r decreases and so does the critical wave number . comparing figures 5a and 5b ,",
    "which differ in its @xmath44 values , we notice more localized bifurcating structures for small values of @xmath44 .",
    "this part of the diagram is called region i. at different @xmath44 the critical r@xmath126 tends to infinity at different @xmath124 values . in figure 6 ,",
    "the curve @xmath141 ( solid line ) that limits region i marks the position of this asymptote in the @xmath142 plane .",
    "an example of a basic state in region i is presented in figure 3a ) .",
    "it corresponds to a return flow .    in figure 5b , at @xmath143 an oscillatory bifurcation is obtained with wave number @xmath115 .",
    "this is detailed in figure 5c , where a zoom of this region is displayed .",
    "the critical r@xmath126  tends to infinity as @xmath124 tends to the interval limits .",
    "the oscillatory mode @xmath109 is just below the instability threshold but very close to it , at the same parameter values .",
    "figure 7 displays the values of @xmath144 as a function of the wave number @xmath59 .",
    "the zero mode is the preferred one , but as the mode one is so close to it , it could be possible that both modes appear after the bifurcation .",
    "the mode @xmath115 corresponds to a target pattern ( see figure 8a ) and the mode @xmath109 to a giant one - armed spiral ( see figure 8b ) .",
    "these plots represent contours of the growing temperature field eigenfunction and their structure are quite similar to those described in boden1,morris1,boden2,nature .",
    "the zone where we find these behaviours is called zone ii ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "we do not find such instabilities for @xmath135 .",
    "in fact they exist only for large enough @xmath44 values in a small interval around @xmath145 , excluding @xmath145 .",
    "this is clearly depicted in figure 6 where curve @xmath146 ( dashed- dotted line ) limits region ii .",
    "figure 3b ) displays an example of a basic state in region ii .",
    "it corresponds to a linear flow .    in figure 5a for @xmath147 and in figure 5b for @xmath148",
    "the bifurcations are stationary with a large wave number which increases when @xmath124 decreases .",
    "the bifurcating structures are localized at the outer part of the cylinder as figures 5a and 5b display . in this range",
    "we can observe how for @xmath135 the critical r@xmath126 decreases with @xmath124 while for @xmath136  r@xmath126tends to grow to infinity at the limit @xmath149 .",
    "this suggests that there is an asymptote where the critical r@xmath126 tends to infinity .",
    "this behavior corresponds to region iii in the @xmath142 plane displayed in figure 6 . figure 3c )",
    "displays an example of a basic state in region iii .",
    "finally for @xmath150  and @xmath136  no instability has been found in zone iv .",
    "this means that in this case there exist external parameter sets at which the axisymmetric basic state is very robust and does not bifurcate to 3d structures .",
    "this regime is surrounded by curve @xmath151 ( dashed line ) in the @xmath142 diagram in figure 6 .",
    "figure 3d ) displays an example of a basic state in zone iv .      _",
    "aspect ratio @xmath152 .",
    "_ results in previous subsections are based on a rather large aspect ratio domain ( @xmath132 ) . at smaller aspect",
    "ratii the geometry of the domain has more influence on instabilities .",
    "typically for uniform heating at smaller aspect ratii instability thresholds are larger than those obtained for larger aspect ratii and critical wave numbers are smaller .",
    "figure 9 shows how the instability thresholds and wave numbers change with @xmath152 .",
    "it is observed that the standard rules just described for the case of uniform heating are mantained , although now oscillatory instabilities are possible .",
    "the same type of instabilities as those previously described are observed .",
    "we notice that in figure 9 for @xmath153 a one - armed spiral is the most unstable mode while giant one - armed spirals described before , where found to be less preferred than target patterns with @xmath154    _ pr number .",
    "_ similar behaviors to those we have just described are also present for large and infinite pr number .",
    "for instance the giant one - armed oscillatory spiral appears as well in a similar range of values of the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath124 ( see figure 8c ) and with the same conditions , the mode @xmath109 oscillatory is just below the instability threshold but very close to it , at the same parameter values      we have studied how stationary and axisymmetric basic states bifurcate to different 3d structures depending on the shape factor @xmath44 and temperature ratio @xmath12 appearing on the temperature boundary condition .",
    "the influence of horizontal and vertical temperature differences on instabilities has been addressed in numerous works @xcite ; in our results a new heat parameter is introduced related to the shape of the applied heat .",
    "we have found that at each @xmath44 , different @xmath124 values define zones with qualitatively different instabilities . typically at small @xmath124 the basic state bifurcates to target and giant spiral wave patterns .",
    "the appearance of these structures is quite similar to those reported in experiments such as @xcite for the uniform heating case .",
    "the reason for this similitude might be the presence of a mean flow in those experiments close to our basic state , that could be caused by a non strictly uniform heat source . we find that even for infinite prandtl number spiral patterns are present .",
    "larger negative @xmath140 values originates very localized states at the outer part of the domain .",
    "localized structures in the centre of the cell are found at small @xmath44 values and positive @xmath124 values . a decreasing aspect ratio increases the instability threshold and decreases the critical wavenumber .",
