    "the existence of the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of fermions depends on the cp violating interactions .",
    "the complex cabibo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements cause the cp violation in the standard model ( sm ) , however , the estimated fermion edms are negligibly small , if the above complex phases are considered .",
    "this stimulates one to investigate these physical quantities in the framework of the new models beyond the sm , such as multi higgs doublet models ( mhdm ) , supersymmetric model ( susy ) , @xcite , ... , etc ..    in the literature there exist the experimental results on the fermion edms , @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite respectively and on the neutron edm h @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "the lepton electric dipole moments has been analyzed in the framework of the seesaw model .",
    "@xcite was devoted to the edms of the leptons in the model iii version of the 2hdm and @xmath6 has been predicted at the order of the magnitude of @xmath7 .",
    "the work @xcite was related to the lepton edm moments in the framework of the sm with the inclusion of non - commutative geometry .",
    "furthermore , the effects of non - universal extra dimensions on the electric dipole moments of fermions in the two higgs doublet model have been estimated in @xcite .",
    "this work is devoted to the prediction of the lepton edms in the two higgs doublet model in which the flavor changing ( fc ) neutral current vertices in the tree level is permitted and the cp violating interactions are carried by complex yukawa couplings .",
    "furthermore , we respect the split fermion scenario where the hierarchy of fermion masses are coming from the overlap of the fermion gaussian profiles in the extra dimensions .",
    "the split fermion scenario has been studied in several works in the literature @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the alternative view of the fermion mass hierarchy has been introduced by assuming that the fermions were located at different points in the extra dimensions and this geometric interpretation resulted in the exponentially small overlaps of their wavefunctions .",
    "the separation of fermions in the extra dimension forbids the local couplings between quarks and leptons and this can ensure a solution also to the proton stability .",
    "@xcite was devoted to the locations of left and right handed components of fermions in the extra dimensions and their roles on the mechanism of yukawa hierarchies .",

    "the discussion of cp violation in the quark sector in the split fermion model was done in @xcite .",

    "then , we assume that the number of extra dimensions is two and the charged leptons are restricted to the fifth extra dimension , with non - zero gaussian profiles . as a final analysis , we predict the edms of charged leptons by taking non - zero gaussian profiles in both extra dimensions .    in the numerical calculations",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present edms of charged leptons in the split fermion scenario , in the two higgs doublet model .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the fermion edm is carried by the cp violating fermion - fermion - photon effective interaction and , for quarks ( for charged leptons ) , the complex ckm matrix ( possible lepton mixing matrix ) elements is the possible source of this violation , in the framework of the sm .",
    "the estimated tiny numerical values of edms of fermions in the sm stimulates one to go beyond and the model iii version of the 2hdm is one of the candidate to get relatively large edm values , since the fc neutral currents ( fcnc ) are permitted at tree level and the new yukawa couplings can be complex in general .",
    "furthermore , the addition of the spatial extra dimensions brings additional contributions sensitive to the compactification scale @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radius of the compactification .",
    "here we take the effects of extra dimensions into account and we follow the idea that the hierarchy of lepton masses are coming from the lepton gaussian profiles in the extra dimensions .",
