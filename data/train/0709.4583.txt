    "the @xmath5-isobar is the lowest nucleon excitation and the most distinguished baryon resonance .",
    "unfortunately , its lifetime ( @xmath6 ) is far too short for a direct measurement of its electromagnetic moments .",
    "a measurement of the electromagnetic moments of such an unstable particle can apparently be done only indirectly , in a three - step process , where the particle is produced , emits a low - energy photon , which plays the role of an external magnetic field , and then decays . in this way the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) of @xmath7",
    "is accessed in the radiative pion - nucleon scattering ( @xmath8 )  @xcite , while the mdm of @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be accessed in the _ radiative photoproduction _  ( @xmath11 ) of neutral  @xcite and charged  @xcite pions , on the proton and neutron respectively .",
    "some theoretical input is then needed in order to extract the mdm value from observables .",
    "for instance , the current particle data group value of the @xmath12 mdm  @xcite : _ ^+ = 2.7 ( ) 1.5 ( ) 3 ( ) _ n , with @xmath13 the nuclear magneton , was obtained by the taps collaboration at mami  @xcite using a phenomenological model of the @xmath14 reaction  @xcite .",
    "the size of the error - bar is rather large due to both experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "recently a dedicated experimental effort took place at mami using the crystal ball detector  @xcite , improving on the statistics of the taps data by almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "the present work is an effort to make an analogous improvement on the theoretical side by using a more consistent and systematic framework of chiral effective - field theory ( ) .",
    "the first calculation within of the radiative pion - photoproduction in the @xmath1-resonance region with the aim of extracting the @xmath12 mdm has been presented in a letter  @xcite . in this more extended publication",
    "we present further details and make a few improvements on the first work .",
    "the previous studies of the radiative pion - photoproduction were based on the so - called ` effective lagrangian approach ' @xcite , where one computes only the ( unitarized ) tree - level contributions , and ` dynamical models ' @xcite , where some pion rescattering effects are included in addition .",
    "the framework of  is more powerful in that it allows to compute the chiral loop corrections in the consistent framework of quantum field theory ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the chiral symmetry of the low - energy strong interaction , together with other general principles , such as unitarity and analyticity , is incorporated in  to any given order in a systematic expansion over the energy scales and hadronic degrees of freedom .    in the problem at hand ,",
    "the energy flow is defined by the energies of incoming and outgoing photon . to access the magnetic dipole moment of the @xmath1",
    "the energy of the incoming photon must be sufficient to excite the resonance , while the emitted photon must be soft .",
    "therefore , in computing this process , we use a chiral expansion with @xmath1-isobar degrees of freedom , the so - called @xmath15-expansion  @xcite , and simultaneously the soft - photon expansion with respect to ( w.r.t . ) the energy of the emitted photon .",
    "the soft - photon expansion is performed to the next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , since this is the order at which the mdm first appears .",
    "the chiral expansion is performed to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) . in this way",
    "the present work can be viewed as an extension of our recent nlo calculation of pion photoproduction  @xcite to the softly radiative pion photoproduction in the @xmath1-resonance region .",

    "the physical values of all , but the last two constants , are fairly well known : @xmath56 is the axial coupling of the nucleon ; @xmath57 is the @xmath58 coupling determined from the @xmath59 scattering @xmath6033 phase - shift  @xcite ; @xmath50 and @xmath51 characterize the electromagnetic @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath63 transition and are fixed from our fit of the pion photoproduction observables  @xcite : @xmath64 , @xmath65 ; the isoscalar and isovector anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleon are very well established : @xmath66 , @xmath67 .    the determination of @xmath54 and @xmath55 ",

    ", the baryon sector has an exact contracted @xmath77 symmetry , where @xmath78 is the number of light quark flavors . for three light quark flavors , this results in the approximate su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry of qcd , which underlies many quark model results . in this limit",
    "the nucleon and @xmath4 are degenerate , and their magnetic moments ( for the same charge state ) are equal , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "note that the @xmath80 relation @xmath81 ( in nuclear magnetons ) yields very different results for the @xmath82-value  : @xmath83 , more than twice the value for an elementary particle , whereas @xmath84 , close to the natural value for an elementary particle .      the chiral power counting in the presence of @xmath1-isobar field is also thoroughly discussed in the literature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "here we adopt the ` @xmath15 counting ' scheme  @xcite , where the @xmath1-resonance excitation energy : m_-m_n 0.3 , is treated differently from the pion mass .",
    "one thus has an expansion with two distinct light scales : @xmath85 and @xmath1 . for power - counting purposes",
    ", one assumes the following relation between the two : ~ ( ) ^2 , where @xmath86 gev stands for the scale of chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath87 , as well as other heavy scales , such as the nucleon mass .",
    "the power 2 in is chosen because it is the closest integer power for the relation between these parameters in nature .",
    "the power counting is then done in orders of @xmath88 , and the power counting index of a given graph depends on whether the generic momentum @xmath89 is in the _ low - energy region _ : @xmath90 , or in the _ resonance region _ : @xmath91 .",
    "such an energy - dependent power counting turns out to be important for a correct size estimate of the _ one - delta - reducible _ ( odr ) graphs , which contain @xmath1-isobar propagators of the type : s_odr = . in the vicinity of the resonance",
    "these propagators diverge , unless a whole class of odr graphs is resummed , leading to a `` dressed '' odr propagator : s_odr^= , where @xmath92 is the self - energy .",

    "the radiative pion photoproduction experiments designed to measure the @xmath1-resonance magnetic dipole moment are done near the resonance energy with the observation of a low - energy photon in the final state .",
    "this means the energy of the initial photon @xmath96 is in the resonance region , @xmath97 , while the energy of the final photon , @xmath98 , is soft .",
    "the expansion in @xmath98 can thus be done akin the usual low - energy expansion ( lex ) , _ i.e. _ , the full amplitude is expanded as : f(, ) = + f_0 ( ) + f_1() +  = _",
    "i=-1 f_i ^i .",

    "as far as the expansion in @xmath15 is concerned , we shall restrict ourselves to nlo .",
    "we therefore begin with the pion photoproduction at nlo , given by the graphs in , where the blob on the @xmath1 propagator and the @xmath100 vertex indicate that those are corrected by the chiral loops as shown in . for the born terms",
    ", only the electric coupling of the photon with energy @xmath101 contributes to nlo .",
    "note also that to this order , only the imaginary part of the loop corrections contributes , while the effect of the real parts is limited to the renormalization of the apropriate masses and coupling constants .",
    "this is why the analogous graphs with the @xmath102 loops are omitted  they do not produce imaginary contributions in the @xmath1-resonance region .",
    "the minimal insertion of the final photon in the nlo photoproduction amplitude yields the radiative pion photoproduction graphs in , where the blob on the @xmath103 vertex indicates the inclusion of the chiral corrections in ( d ) and ( e ) .",

    "we use the on - mass - shell renormalization , such that @xmath115 is the physical mass and the field renormalization constant satisfies : re@xmath116 .",

    "as mentioned above , the real parts can be renormalized away to the considered order .",
    "certainly this is possible only when we work in the vicinity of the resonance and for the physical pion masses .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath1 mdm away from the physical pion mass , will be discussed in a forthcoming publication .",

    "to access the mdm of the @xmath9 , we consider the radiative pion photoproduction process on a nucleon , i.e. , the @xmath11 reaction . in this section",
    "we define a few useful observables of this reaction .    in the discussion of observables",
    "it is customary to denote the incoming photon energy by @xmath153 ( instead of @xmath96 as above ) and the outgoing photon energy by @xmath154 ( instead of @xmath98 ) . in the rest of the paper we shall adhere to this notation .",

    "because measuring a five - fold differential cross section with sufficient precision is very challenging , we shall also consider several partially integrated cross sections .",
    "for example , @xmath159 denotes the @xmath11 cross section differential w.r.t .  the outgoing photon energy and the pion solid angle , where one has integrated over all outgoing photon directions .",

    "we begin with which shows the eft results for the ratio @xmath187 of the @xmath14 differential cross section relative to the @xmath188 one as defined in eq .",

    "the dashed curves represent our previous results @xcite , while the solid lines show the result of the present eft calculation .",
    "the difference between the two calculations is that in ref .",
    "@xcite the outgoing photon energy was counted as @xmath190 , while presently we use the soft - photon expansion , , which required the inclusion of additional bremsstrahlung diagrams .",
    "the present calculation thus includes all graphs shown in and , while in the previous calculation non - resonant terms ( i.e. , graphs without @xmath4 s ) were not included .",
    "note that while we now include the non - resonant graphs with the initial photon coupled to the charge of the nucleon or pion , we do not include the coupling of the initial photon to the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon ( in the non - resonant graphs ) , as it is suppressed by one more power of @xmath15 compared to the electric coupling .",
    "both calculations in are shown for @xmath191 corresponding with @xmath192 ( in @xmath4 magnetons ) .",
    "one sees that the effect of the non - resonant contributions included in the new calculation mainly affect the linear and circular photon asymmetries . for values of @xmath158 above about 70 mev , the non - resonant terms in the present eft calculation",
    "are responsible for the significant decrease in @xmath167 in contrast to the previous calculation , where the linear photon asymmetry is nearly constant over the whole @xmath158 range shown in .",
    "the effect of the non - resonant terms also shows up in a sizable change in the circular photon asymmetry @xmath189 with increasing outgoing photon energy .    in the soft - photon limit ( @xmath193 ) , the present calculation of @xmath11 goes to the corresponding nlo photoproduction result  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been shown @xcite to be in an agreement with the well - measured @xmath188 observables in a 100 mev window around the @xmath4-resonance position .",
    "in particular , one sees the nice agreement with the experimental @xmath188 linear photon asymmetry , shown by the data point for @xmath167 in . in",
    ", we show the outgoing photon energy dependence for the absolute @xmath14 differential cross sections for different values of @xmath194 .",
    "the cross sections in have been integrated over all pion and outgoing photon angles and are compared with the first data for this reaction from ref .",
    "one sees that at @xmath195  mev , all calculations are consistent with the available data . with increasing photon energies ( compare @xmath196  mev vs.  @xmath197  mev in ) , the present eft calculation yields an increasing reduction in the absolute cross section relative to the previous calculation .",
    "although this trend is consistent with the existing data , both the precision and sensitivity of these integrated data are insufficient to extract a value of @xmath194 besides favoring values in the range between 1 and 3 @xmath4 magnetons . this is also demonstrated in , where the outgoing photon angular dependence of the cross section is shown when integrated over all pion angles and for all values of @xmath198  mev .",
    "the eft calculation is consistent with the angular dependence displayed by the first data of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the higher energy results ( @xmath199  mev ) also seem to favor the range @xmath200 . to enhance the sensitivity to the value of @xmath194 , we next study @xmath14 observables that are more differential . in",
    "we show the cross section and linear photon asymmetry @xmath167 , both differential in the outgoing photon energy and pion angle for three values of the outgoing pion angle .",
    "one verifies that in the low - energy limit , @xmath193 , the photon asymmetries of the present eft calculation are in very good agreement with the photon asymmetry data for the @xmath188 reaction as required by the low - energy theorem . with increasing photon energies , the linear photon asymmetries in the present eft calculation steadily decrease and",
    "show an increasing sensitivity to the value of @xmath194 , especially around @xmath201 .",
    "the @xmath14 differential cross sections show a pion angular behavior which can mainly be understood from the following two observations .",
    "first , the underlying @xmath188 pion angular distribution is peaked at @xmath201 being approximately symmetrical around this value in the resonance region .",
    "second , the forward - backward asymmetry arises from the bremsstrahlung processes which display a strong enhancement for backward pion angles compared with forward pion angles , as noted in ref .",
    "one furthermore notices from that , for photon energies @xmath202  mev , the unpolarized differential cross sections also show a modest sensitivity to the value of @xmath203 . for an increased sensitivity to the @xmath9 mdm",
    ", it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to measure the asymmetry for a circularly polarized photon beam , as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : casymm]-[eq : casymmg ] ) .",
    "these helicity asymmetries are only non zero for a three - body final state and vanish in the soft - photon limit @xmath193 , i.e , when the @xmath11 process reduces to the two - body , @xmath164 process .    in , we show the nlo eft results for the outgoing photon azimuthal - angle dependence of the @xmath14 cross sections , for @xmath170 ( i.e. , the initial photon and outgoing pions define the reference plane ) .",
    "we show both unpolarized cross section ( upper panels ) and the difference in helicity cross sections for a circularly polarized photon beam .",
    "the azimuthal - angle dependencies of the helicity - averaged and helicity - difference cross sections follow the expansions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : unpolexp ] ) and ( [ eq : polexp ] ) respectively .",
    "one sees from that the helicity difference cross section is dominated by its lowest harmonic , i.e. the term proportional to @xmath185 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : polexp ] ) .",
    "hence , a measurement of the @xmath204 dependence of the helicity difference cross section allows to extract its lowest moment , defined as the circular photon polarization asymmetry @xmath189 , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : casymm ] ) . the eft predictions for the circular photon polarization asymmetries @xmath189 and",
    "@xmath205 are shown in and respectively .",
    "the nlo eft calculation firstly verifies that @xmath189 and @xmath205 vanish in the limit @xmath193 . with increasing photon energy ,",
    "these asymmetries show a very clear sensitivity on the @xmath9 mdm .",
    "one sees from that , for @xmath196  mev and around @xmath206  mev , the asymmetry changes by 0.1 to 0.2 when varying the @xmath9 mdm in the range @xmath207 of @xmath4 magnetons .",
    "note also that for a given value of @xmath208 both @xmath189 and @xmath205 change sign between forward and backward angles .",
    "the sensitivity of the circular photon polarization asymmetries on @xmath208 can be understood from the observation that these observables arise from the product of the imaginary part of the ( resonant ) @xmath14 amplitude with the real part of the @xmath14 amplitude .",
    "hence the sensitivity on the real part of the @xmath9 mdm is amplified by multiplication with the large imaginary part , mainly arising from the bremsstrahlung diagrams containing one ( resonant ) @xmath4 line , where the final photon is radiated from either initial or final proton lines .",
    "the photon helicity asymmetry @xmath189 is also sensitive to the imaginary part of the @xmath9 mdm by multiplication with the real part of the @xmath14 amplitude , as is shown by the dotted curves in and , which have been obtained by switching off the imaginary part of @xmath72 .",
    "note that in the present eft calculation the imaginary part of the @xmath4 mdm is obtained as a prediction of the one - loop calculations of ( d ) and ( e ) , as detailed in sec .",
    "we explore the large sensitivity of @xmath189 on @xmath209 further in .",
    "the top panel of illustrates that for a photon beam energy of @xmath195  mev , where the initial @xmath4 is near resonant , there is a range of about 30 - 40 mev in final photon energy where the photon helicity difference cross section @xmath210 is near linear in @xmath158 .",
    "the bottom panel of which is obtained from the top panel by dividing through @xmath158 shows this slope in @xmath158 .",
    "one sees that the slope is directly proportional to @xmath209 .",
    "although this comes out of the nlo eft calculation , we like to point out that this is a model independent feature , resulting from the low - energy theorem for the @xmath11 process .",
    "indeed in the low - energy expansion of the dependence on the @xmath9 mdm comes in at the linear term in @xmath158 .",
    "because @xmath189 has to vanish ( exactly ) in the limit @xmath193 , it starts out with the linear term in the lex , which also depends linearly on the @xmath9 mdm .",
    "in view of the large sensitivity of @xmath189 on the @xmath9 mdm , it will be of interest to compare with first data for this observable .",
    "such data have recently been taken by the crystal ball @ mami @xmath14 experiment  @xcite .",
    "although this experiment was optimized for a linearly polarized photon beam , the experiment also took data with a circularly polarized photon beam .",
    "illustrates that a future dedicated measurement of this photon helicity asymmetry for @xmath211  mev provides an opportunity for a model independent extraction of the @xmath9 mdm .",
    "finally we also show the nlo eft results for the @xmath212 reaction in and . by comparing with",
    ", one sees that the ratio of the @xmath212 to @xmath14 reactions is around a factor 6 , around @xmath213 .",
    "the origin of the enhancement in the charged pion channel is the bremsstrahlung from the light charged pion .",
    "however the sensitivity to the resonance properties in the charged pion observables seems to be lesser pronounced than in the neutral pion channel .",
    "nonetheless , the charged pion observables may provide further test of the present eft framework in which both channels are calculated simultaneously with the same set of parameters .",
    "in this work we continue to develop and apply a systematic extension of chiral perturbation theory to the @xmath1-resonance region . here",
    "we have presented the calculation of the imaginary part of the @xmath1 magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) , as well as a comprehensive study of the observables of the @xmath11 process in the @xmath16-resonance region .",
    "the chiral expansion for the @xmath11 amplitudes is performed using the so - called @xmath3 power - counting scheme , to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "furthermore , we use a simultaneous low - energy expansion in the energy @xmath214 of the emitted photon which includes all terms up to o(@xmath214 ) , where the @xmath1 mdm first appears . to this order , besides the tree - level resonant diagrams , the calculation involves one - loop vertex corrections to the @xmath215 and @xmath17 vertices , as well as non - resonant ( born ) diagrams . the only free parameter which enters at this order is the @xmath4 mdm . the one - loop corrections to the @xmath17 vertex give an imaginary ( absorptive ) part to the @xmath4 mdm , which was quantified .    concerning the observables ,",
    "the outgoing - photon energy and angular dependencies of the @xmath14 unpolarized cross section were found to be consistent with first experimental data for this process ( assuming about 10 percent uncertainty of our results , coming from the neglect of higher - order contributions ) .",
    "we quantified the sensitivities of the @xmath14 cross section and photon asymmetries to the @xmath9 mdm .",
    "it appears that , at low energies of the outgoing photon , the dependence of the cross - section and linear - photon asymmetries on the mdm is quadratic , i.e. , depends on @xmath216 .",
    "the asymmetry for a circularly polarized photon beam , however , displays a linear dependence on the @xmath9 mdm .",
    "the helicity difference @xmath217 cross section for a circularly polarized photon beam vanishes linearly with @xmath214 when approaching the soft - photon limit , its slope being proportional to the @xmath9 mdm .",
    "therefore , a dedicated measurement of the @xmath14 cross sections with a circularly polarized photon beam provides a unique opportunity for a model - independent extraction of the @xmath9 mdm .",
