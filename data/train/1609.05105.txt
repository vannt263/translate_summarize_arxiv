    "axions @xcite are between the most serious dark matter candidates .",
    "they are light neutral scalar or pseudoscalar bosons , with mass @xmath2ev@xmath3ev , coupled to the electromagnetic field via @xmath4 in qcd axion models ( dfsz @xcite and ksvz @xcite ) , the axion - photon coupling constant @xmath5 is directly related to @xmath6 ; thus , @xmath5 is the only free parameter of the theory . in axion - like particle ( alp ) searches ,",
    "the parameter space is extended : @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the free parameters @xcite .",
    "axions and alps experimental searches can be divided into two main categories : 1 ) axions from astrophysical and cosmological sources ; 2 ) laboratory searches . in the former case ,",
    "exclusion limits on the axion - photon coupling constant are provided by estimates of stellar - energy losses @xcite , helioscopes @xcite and haloscopes @xcite . in the latter case , limits on @xmath5 are given by photon polarization @xcite and light - shining - through - wall ( lsw ) @xcite experiments .    in this contribution , we will focus on lsw experiments . after a brief description of the standard lsw experimental apparatus , we will discuss how to improve present alps laboratory limits on @xmath5 by at least four orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we are willing to do this by using extremely intense photon fluxes from gyrotron sources at frequencies around 30 ghz , tes single photon detectors with efficiency @xmath0 , and high quality factor fabry - perot cavities in the microwave domain ( @xmath7 ) , both on the photon - axion conversion and photon regeneration sides .",
    "in a lsw experiment @xcite , a coherent photon beam traverses an intense magnetic field , @xmath8 . here , some photons can convert into axions via the primakoff effect .",
    "photons exchange 3-momentum @xmath9 with @xmath8 , the energy is conserved .",
    "if the @xmath10 axis is chosen in the direction of the propagating photon beam , then the external magnetic is assumed to be uniform in the volume @xmath11 .",
    "the photons which do not convert into axions are stopped by an optical barrier ,  the wall \" . while axions can cross the wall , due to their negligible cross - section with ordinary matter . on the other side of the wall",
    "there is a second magnetic field , which can convert axions back to photons .",
    "reconverted photons may be detected via a single - photon detector .    in the @xmath12 limit",
    ", the photon to axion ( axion to photon ) conversion probability is given by @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photon ( axion ) energy and @xmath6 the axion mass .",
    "in the limit @xmath15 , which is relevant for the stax experiment , the previous expression for the conversion probability has to be regulated @xcite @xmath16 the photon - axion - photon rate reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 [ s@xmath19 is the initial photon flux and @xmath20 the single - photon - detector efficiency",
    ". the rate can be increased by introducing a fabry - perot cavity in the magnetic field area before the wall by a factor of @xmath21 , which is the quality factor of the cavity . moreover , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rate can be further increased with the addition of a second fabry - perot cavity in the magnetic field region beyond the wall .",
    "[ fig : uno ] .",
    "the best laboratory limits for the axion - photon coupling constant have been provided by the alps collaboration @xcite .",
    "the second stage of alps , alps - ii @xcite , will improve the previous limits mainly by increasing the magnetic field length as well as introducing a second cavity in the magnetic field region behind the wall .",
    "alps - ii configuration is very similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] , but in this case the photon flux is provided by an optical laser .",
    "cl exclusion limits that stax and stax 2 may achieve in case of a null result for axions with @xmath22 mev .",
    "an exposure time of one month and zero dark counts are considered .",
    " stax \" and  stax 2 \" configurations correspond to a 100 kw and 1 mw gyrotron sources , respectively .",

    "copyright.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    our goal is to develop a new generation lsw experiment and improve the limits on @xmath5 by using sub - thz photon sources .",
    "sub - thz sources , like gyrotrons and klystrons , can provide very high powers ( up to 1 mw ) at small photon frequencies , resulting in photon fluxes up to @xmath23 more intense than those from optical lasers , used in previous lsw experiments .",
    "we will also use high q - factor fabry - perot cavities for microwave photons and single - photon detectors for light at these frequencies , with almost zero dark count , based on the ( transition - edge - sensor ) tes technology .",
    "the tes detector will be coupled to an antenna and operated at temperatures @xmath24 mk .    in this way",
