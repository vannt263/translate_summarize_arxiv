    "@xcite reviewed the publication statistics on research related to sun and heliosphere starting in 1911 and ending in 2014 .",
    "they did so on the occasion of the reorganization of the commission structure of the international astronomical union which formally ended its commission 10 on `` solar activity '' .",
    "@xcite analyzed the activity of the research community using the tools provided by the astrophysics data system ( adsservice.html ] ) , which enables searches over all the major trade publications in astrophysics in general .",
    "they reviewed the number of refereed publications per year going back over a century , and quantified the population of active researchers and their publication productivity . in the remainder of this section only ,",
    "i use their results and largely their wording and conclusions , but updated the figures and other results to include 2015 and added comments on the trend changes in the mid-1970s .",
    "[ fig : yearlystats ]    the study of phenomena related to `` solar activity '' often involves other aspects of the sun ( such as internal dynamics , dynamo , or surface field patterns ) and they are obviously not limited to the sun but drive phenomena throughout the heliosphere .",
    "@xcite therefore do not separate by research disciplines , but searched ads for abstracts of refereed publications in the `` astronomy '' database , either mentioning the sun or heliosphere or their synonyms .",
    "they filtered out at least many of the papers that do not deal with sun / heliosphere that come into the search results because their abstracts include , for example , a unit like `` solar mass '' ; to do so , they excluded abstracts that contain one or more of the following words or word groups : cluster , dwarf , extrasolar , galaxy , gravitational , ice , kpc , solar system , stellar , binary , sunset , sunrise , eclipse , solar cell , solar occultation , interstellar medium , and supernova .",
    "the ads searches suggest that the productivity of the world - wide community researching the sun and heliosphere continues to grow steadily when measured through its publications ( top panel in figure  [ fig : yearlystats ] ) . a rapid growth in the number of refereed publications that started after the second world war continued up to about 1975 .",
    "after that , the growth slowed drastically , transitioning to a sustained increase that doubles the number of refereed publications on a time scale of approximately 40 years , reaching a total of 2285 publications by 2015 .",
    ".number of refereed publications on solar and heliospheric physics grouped by country of the affiliation of the lead author , sorted by decreasing number . [ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > \" , ]     in automated searches as used here it is not readily possible to avoid some distortion of the statistics associated with the author names .",
    "for one thing , authors with identical family names and initials for their given names are not differentiated . also , authors who publish with different spellings or composites of their family names ( _ e.g. _ married and maiden names ) or their initials will be counted as separate individuals . however , these effects are expected to have limited impacts on relative trends .",
    "the number of unique author names contributing to refereed publications shows a trend ( shown in the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : yearlystats ] ) that roughly mimics that of the number of publications ; after about 1975 , the growth rate of the author population of @xmath0%/yr is about twice the growth rate of the world s overall population ( which averaged at @xmath1%/yr over the same period ; @xcite ) .",
    "in 2015 , ads returned a total of 90 distinct refereed journals ( plus a few phd theses that also qualify as refereed publications but are likely underrepresented in the data base ) with publications on solar and heliospheric topics .",
    "figure  [ fig : njournals ] shows the distribution over the journals , sorted by decreasing number of publications in that year , using the standard abbreviations as used by ads .",
    "the top ten by number of publications in 2015 together contain about 73%  of all selected publications .",
    "figure  [ fig : journals ] shows the evolution of the number of papers in this top-10 over the past half century ( after a 3-yr smoothing to dampen fluctuations and for easier viewing of the results ) .",
    "note the relatively flat number of publications in solar physics since about 1970 compared to the sustained growth in that number in the astrophysical journal . also note that the predominant journal for solar and heliospheric science changed from solar physics to the astrophysical journal around the early 1990s , and that jgra and a&a overtook solar physics in the first years of this millenium .",
    "astronomy and astrophysics shows a relative growth in the rate of solar and heliospheric publications similar to that in the astrophysical journal from the early 1970s through 2006 , after which a declining trend sets in over the past decade .",
    "ads also enables a review of the affiliations of the lead authors of the refereed publications in ads for 2015 on solar and heliospheric sciences and their use in other publications .",
    "when grouped by country for the affiliation of the lead author , funding agencies and national academies of science are involved through first authors in 7.4%  of all papers from nasa in the usa , and generally more than 50%  in china , russia , and the former republics of the ussr ( where the russian academy of sciences includes about 60%  of all scientific organizations ) .",
    "when sorting affiliations of lead authors by general geographic region the following publications statistics result ( see figure  [ fig : regions ] ) : from europe ( including russia ) : 969 ( 45%  of the total ) ; from the americas : 632 ( 29% ) ; from australasia : 517 ( 24% ) ; from africa and arab countries ( to pakistan ) : 50 ( 2% ) .    2 # 1isbn # 1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1_#1_#1*#1*#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#2#1#1#1#1#1_#1_#1#1#1*#1*#1#1#1_#1_#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1 # 1http://dx.doi.org/#1 [ ] # 1http://arxiv.org / abs/#1 [ ] # 1http://adsabs.harvard.edu / abs/#1[]#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1#1"
