    "<S> this conclusion deserves a more detailed explanation . </S>",
    "<S> first , we notice that the metallicity rule for cnts , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the sin - dependence in the @xmath23direction implies opposite signs for coefficients @xmath70 belonging to edge sites @xmath20 on opposite sides of cr . by rolling up a nanotube the carbon sites on opposite edges of ribbon should coincide , which in turn destroys the odd solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the even solutions satisfying the cyclic condition survive the rolling up procedure but none of them has energy at @xmath42 .    </S>",

    "<S> , they have discrete energy spectra . however , these spectra are closely related with electron bands which we have already considered . in particular , energy levels of rgms and cnts near the fermi energy are described by the following expression :    @xmath71    where @xmath72    @xmath73 , ... and @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . here </S>",

    "<S> the electron spectrum given by ( [ c.12a ] ) is independent of width which is consistent with the situation observed for 1d objects . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that the spectrum of 0d carbon objects consists of many discrete levels and instead of fermi level we should speak of highest occupied ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied ( lumo ) molecular orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that formally we can not speak of metallicity and semiconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , in tables  [ tab1]-[tab3 ] we retain these terms in a loose sense , because from one side , it shows relations with corresponding 1d objects and from the other side , the existence or nonexistence of a large energy gap at the homo - lumo region remains one of the important characteristics of these systems .    . </S>",
