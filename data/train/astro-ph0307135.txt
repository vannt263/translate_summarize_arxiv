    "more massive halos with @xmath7k , in which collisional ionization and line cooling can operate , are expected to be very rare at these redshifts .",
    "modulo the effects of uv feedback on @xmath2 formation and cooling , stars forming in such halos could therefore play a dominant role in an early reionization epoch",
    ". a great deal of effort has gone into assessing the impact of uv feedback on @xmath2 cooling , as well as the counter - vailing effects of positive feedback effects such as an early x - ray background ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the main point of this paper is that the population of mini ",
    "halos is likely to be considerably sparser than previously assumed .",
    "this is because mini ",
    "halo formation is strongly suppressed even inside the fossil hii regions of dead ionizing sources .",
    "although such hii regions recombine and cool by compton scattering with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , they can not cool to back to the temperature of the undisturbed intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "strong jeans mass filtering takes place ( gnedin 2000 ) , and subsequent mini ",
    "halos will no longer be able to accrete gas due to the smoothing effects of finite gas pressure .",
    "_ thus , once any patch of the universe is ionized , it can no longer host any more mini ",
    "halos , even if it subsequently cools and recombines_. in effect , the birth of the first stars leads to the demise of the mini  halo population : only one generation of stars can form within these shallow potential wells .    while many authors have noted and commented on the jeans mass filtering after full reionization @xcite , the jeans filtering in fossil hii regions after ionizing sources have turned off has not been studied .",
    "we argue that it will strongly suppress the mini ",
    "halo population , with the following interesting consequences :    * impact of mini  halo population on reionization . *    since the recombination time is shorter than the hubble time at high redshift , @xmath8 , and the ionizing sources , expected to be massive stars , have short lifetimes , @xmath9 , many generations of star formation are required to keep a given patch of the igm ionized . however , once the first generation of stars born in mini ",
    "halos dies out , subsequent generations will not be able to form in mini ",
    "halos in a previously reionized patch of igm , even after the patch cools and recombines .",
    "this effect inevitably produces a non  monotonic reionization history with an early peak of partial reionization , followed by recombination and eventual full reionization .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the reionization history derived by cen ( 2003 ) and wyithe & loeb ( 2003 ) , although the physical reason for the non  monotonic evolution in the present work is different ( entropy injection , rather than a pop iii to pop ii transition caused by a universal metallicity increase ) .",
    "regardless of the extent of uv feedback effects on @xmath2 production and cooling , the majority of stars which reionized the universe were hosted by more massive halos able to survive jeans mass filtering , @xmath10k .    * photon budget for reionization .",
    "*    dense gas that collects in mini  halos can form a considerable sink of ionizing photons by boosting the overall effective gas clumping factor @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the clumping factor @xmath12 increases rapidly at low redshift as structure formation progresses ; thus , despite the higher mean gas density @xmath13 at high redshift , the recombination time @xmath14 does not evolve strongly from @xmath15 .",
    "however , if the universe is filled up with fossil hii regions at high redshift , the photon budgets required to subsequently ionize it and to keep it ionized are much lower , since gas clumping in mini ",
    "halos is strongly suppressed .",
    "* source clustering .",
    "*    since preheating boosts the threshold mass required for efficient gas cooling and star formation , it increases the mean bias of the early proto - galaxy population by a factor of a few ( e.g. , see figure 2 of ) .",
    "this is likely to increase the clustering amplitude of background fluctuations due to these faint unresolved early proto - galaxies , such as : the free - free background due to ionized halos @xcite , sunyaev - zeldovich fluctuations due to high redshift hii regions and supernovae winds @xcite , and the ir background due to stellar emission @xcite .",
    "the increase in clustering bias boosts the amplitude of rms fluctuations by a factor of several .",
    "this may be necessary , for instance , if thermal sz fluctuations from high - redshift supernovae are to account for the small - scale cmb anisotropies observed by bima and cbi @xcite .",
    "* star formation history / metallicity / imf .",
    "*    initially , each mini  halo is expected to harbor a single massive , metal  free star ( no fragmentation is seen in numerical simulations by abel et al .",
    "2000 and bromm et al .",
    "because of the preheating , no further mini  halos can form in the entire comoving volume reionized by this mini  halo . as a result , the first generation of stars is expected to form as a population of single , isolated stars .",
    "star formation ensues again only once more massive halos with deeper potential wells aggregate .",
    "these rare , high density peaks are likely to coincide with the highly biased regions where the first isolated stars had already formed . at the time of the formation of deeper potential wells , such sites are inevitably already polluted with metals , unless the first stars collapsed directly to black holes without associated metal production . as a result , the transition from pop iii to pop ii ( metal free to normal ) stellar populations is associated with halo mass scale .",
    "this is in contrast to scenarios ( cen 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ) where star formation can continually proceed in lower density peaks , which are far from the initial sites of star formation and still contain relatively pristine gas ( allowing metal - free star formation to continue to relatively low redshifts ) .",
    "given the factor of @xmath16 difference in the ionizing photon production efficiency per unit mass between pop iii and pop ii stars ( tumlinson & shull 2000 ; bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ; schaerer 2002 ) , this will have important consequences for the redshift evolution and topology of reionization .",
    "* 21 cm observations . *",
    "it has been suggested that mini ",
    "halos will be observable at the redshifted 21 cm line frequency both in emission @xcite , and absorption @xcite .",
    "if mini  halo formation is strongly suppressed , these two windows on small - scale structure during the cosmological dark ages will disappear .",
    "21 cm observations of mini  halos therefore provide an interesting probe of the topology of fossil hii regions : if mini ",
    "halos are seen , that comoving patch of the igm has _ never _ been ionized .",
    "this is complementary to other observations such as gunn - peterson absorption , which only probe the instantaneous ionization state .",

    "[ section : halo_profiles ] , we calculate the effects of this entropy floor on the gas density profile in mini  halos . in  [ section : global ] , we discuss and quantify several important effects of this entropy floor for reionization , and in  [ sec : reionhist ] we explicitly calculate the effect on the reionization history .",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss their implications in  [ section : conclusions ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the background cosmological parameters as measured by the _ wmap _ experiment ( spergel et al . 2003 , tables 1 and 2 ) , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and an initial matter power spectrum @xmath21 with @xmath22 and normalization @xmath23 .",
    "early reionization introduces an entropy floor in the intergalactic medium which impedes gas accretion and cooling in halos with @xmath24k which can not excite atomic cooling .",
    "early reionization even introduces jeans smoothing effects in halos with @xmath25k , since the strength of the accretion shock is weaker in preheated gas , and a deeper potential well is required to collisionally ionize the gas . the overall effect is to introduce a substantial core in the gas density profile .",
    "the effect is similar to the presumed preheating of the igm by galactic winds or agn outflows at low redshift .",
    "there , the finite entropy of the gas introduces a core in group and cluster gas density profiles and is thought to be responsible for the deviation from self - similarity in the observed cluster @xmath26 relation ( for a recent review , see ) .",
    "entropy is more fundamental than gas temperature in low - redshift clusters and high - redshift mini ",
    "halos : in both cases , entropy is conserved , since @xmath27 .",
    "we exploit this analogy , and deliberately employ language and techniques from the well - studied low redshift case to study high - redshift mini  halos . here",
    ", we calculate the expected level of the entropy floor due to early reionization .",
    "reionization is likely to be a highly stochastic process where sources ionize a patch of the igm and then fade ; the fossil hii region subsequently cools and recombines .",
    "what is the final temperature a fossil hii region can cool to ? at the high redshifts of interest , compton cooling off the cmb is by far the dominant source of gas cooling in the low density igm ( e.g. , at @xmath28 and @xmath29k , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the gas overdensity , and @xmath32 is the atomic cooling timescale ) .",
    "the final gas temperature is therefore determined by the competition between compton cooling and hydrogen recombination : after the gas recombines , it decouples from the cmb , and compton cooling is no longer efficient .",
    "the compton cooling timescale is independent of density and temperature : @xmath33 whereas the recombination time @xmath34 is shorter for higher density gas .",
    "thus , denser gas decouples from the cmb earlier and freezes out at _ higher _ temperatures . for the redshifts of interest , @xmath35 , allowing for substantial cooling below @xmath36k .",
    "we can study the temperature evolution of a cooling and recombining parcel of gas @xmath37 as a function of time @xmath38 ( or redshift interval @xmath39 ) , initial temperature @xmath40 , gas overdensity @xmath41 and redshift @xmath42 . in figure 2",
    "we show the dependence of the final temperature on these parameters by solving the full set of chemical evolution equations for primordial gas .",
    "we neglect @xmath2 chemistry as a trace uv flux is sufficient to photodissociate @xmath2 at these low igm densities .",
    "our fiducial patch has an initial temperature @xmath43k , cools at @xmath28 , for a time interval @xmath44 ( corresponding to roughly @xmath45 ) , and lies at an overdensity @xmath46 ; each panel shows the dependence on one of the variables holding the others fixed .",
    "we do not take into account time - dependent variation of the gas density arising from infall onto non - linear structures or hubble expansion , which would provide adiabatic heating / cooling of the gas ; however the effects of this may be roughly estimated by considering some mean overdensity @xmath31 of the gas during its evolution .",
    "the final temperature is almost independent of @xmath40 , as long as @xmath47 and the gas was initially fully ionized .",
    "however , the final temperature declines at higher redshifts and low overdensities @xmath31 , since @xmath48 , and the gas cools faster than it recombines .    in appendix",
    "i , we develop an analytic expression for @xmath49 taking into account only compton cooling and recombination which is remarkably accurate ; it is given by the points in figure [ fig : temp_params ] .",
    "this allows one to estimate the final temperature quickly without evolving the coupled differential equations .",
    "it deviates from the true answer significantly only at high overdensity and/or low redshift , when atomic line cooling becomes comparable to compton cooling .",
    "in any case , for metal - free gas , line cooling alone can only cool the gas down to @xmath50k . the only processes which could alter the final entropy of the gas significantly are @xmath2 cooling and metal line cooling .",
    "these are more efficient than compton cooling only in regions of high overdensity , in the halo core , and so do not affect the initial entropy floor .",
    "once cooling becomes ineffective , the gas evolves adiabatically .",
    "in accordance with convention , we shall refer to the quantity : @xmath51 as the entropy of the gas , even though it is not strictly the thermodynamic entropy @xmath52 .",
    "this is a useful convention because @xmath53 is conserved when the gas evolves adiabatically .",
    "thus , it is conserved during hubble expansion , as well as during accretion onto halos ( provided the accretion shock is weak , gas will be accreted isentropically ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : entropy_params ] , we show the dependence of the final entropy @xmath53 on redshift ( the dependence on @xmath54 follow simply from figure [ fig : temp_params ] ) .",
    "the gas has significantly lower entropy at higher redshift , since compton cooling is more efficient .",
    "however , the final entropy at a given redshift depends only weakly on the overdensity @xmath31 .",
    "denser gas remains at higher temperature , since it recombines faster than it cools , and the combination of higher temperature and higher density roughly cancel @xmath55 .",
    "we can therefore ignore the weak @xmath31 dependence of @xmath53 , and assume that it depends only on @xmath42 .",
    "_ the entropy floor is thus roughly independent of the details of structure formation and gas density distribution . _",
    "it is useful to define a parameter which compares the igm entropy floor to the entropy generated by gravitational shock heating alone .",
    "let us define the quantity @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( and @xmath59 is the nfw @xcite dark matter density profile ) .",
    "this is the entropy due to shock heating alone at the virial radius ; the justification will become clearer in the ensuing section . as @xmath60 increases , the jeans smoothing effects due to finite igm entropy become increasingly more significant .",
    "this parameter @xmath61 will be used extensively in the following sections , and it is useful here to get a sense of what values of @xmath60 are expected . in figure",
    "[ fig : khat_z ] , we plot @xmath60 for a @xmath62k halo as a function of redshift , using @xmath63 shown in figure [ fig : entropy_params ] . since @xmath64 , and a @xmath62k halo is about the most massive that would still not experience atomic cooling , the solid line depicts a lower limit on @xmath60 for all mini  halos .",
    "appropriate values for @xmath60 for smaller halos can be read off simply from the @xmath64 scaling .",
    "we see that for most halos , @xmath65 ; although @xmath66 falls at high redshift , this is somewhat offset by the fact that typical potential wells are much shallower , and thus @xmath67 also falls rapidly ( as seen by the dashed lines , which depict @xmath60 for 2@xmath68 and 3@xmath68 fluctuations ) .    typical values for @xmath60 are illustrated further in figure [ fig : mass_frac_khat ] , where we show the mass weighted fraction of mini  halos which have entropy parameters less than a given @xmath60 , given by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mass corresponding to @xmath60 for a given @xmath63 , @xmath71 is the cosmological jeans mass ( e.g. , see ) , @xmath72 is the mass corresponding to a @xmath73k halo , and @xmath74 is the press - schechter mass function .",
    "virtually all halos have @xmath65 in fossil hii regions at all redshifts of interest ( @xmath75 ) , and median values of @xmath60 are much higher .",
    "we shall soon see that such halos are subject to very substantial jeans smoothing effects .",
    "reionization by x - rays @xcite would produce a warm ( few @xmath76k ) , weakly ionized igm with an entropy floor similar to that in fossil hii regions .",
    "such x - rays could arise from supernovae , agn , or x - ray binaries , or in more exotic models with decaying massive sterile neutrinos ( hansen & haiman 2003 ) .",
    "the universe is optically thick to all photons with energies : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the mean neutral fraction , and we have assumed @xmath79 . thus , _ all _ energy radiated below @xmath80 will be absorbed .",
    "the relative efficiency of uv photons and x - rays in setting an entropy floor deserves detailed separate study ; here we discuss some salient points .",
    "uv photons are an energetically extravagant means of producing an entropy floor .",
    "most of the energy injected by uv photons is lost to recombinations and compton cooling at high redshift ; we see in figure [ fig : temp_params ] that the gas typically compton cools to @xmath81k at the redshifts of interest .",
    "thus , only @xmath82 of the heat injected by uv photons is eventually utilized in setting the entropy floor ; all energy expended in heating the gas above @xmath83 is wasted ( it is dumped into the cmb , where it may eventually be observable as a spectral distortion , fixsen & mather 2002 ) . on the other hand , in the weakly ionized gas produced by x - rays , both the recombination time and the compton cooling time are longer than the hubble time .",
    "in particular , @xmath84 and almost none of the entropy injected is lost to cooling .",
    "furthermore , a larger fraction of the x - ray energy goes toward heating rather than ionization ( in general , few@xmath85 of the energy of the hot photo - electron created by an x - ray goes toward heating ; this fraction quickly rises toward unity as the medium becomes progressively more ionized @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is the comoving emissivity ) , x - rays could be comparable or even more effective than uv photons in setting an entropy floor .",
    "the relative emissivities of uv and x - rays is unknown , but for supernovae could be as high as @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the escape fraction of ionizing uv photons from the host halo , and @xmath90 is the fraction of supernova explosion energy which goes into soft x - rays , either through inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by relativistic electrons @xcite , or free - free emission from the hot sn remnant .    to make a quick estimate ,",
    "let us ( fairly conservatively ) assume that @xmath91 of the explosion energy of a supernova goes into soft x - rays . of this",
    ", @xmath92 of the energy goes into heating ; the rest goes into secondary ionizations and atomic excitations .",
    "a supernova releases @xmath93mev in explosion energy per metal baryon , relatively independent of metallicity ( a pop iii hypernova produces @xmath94 times more energy , but also @xmath95 times more metals than a standard type ii sn ) .",
    "x - ray heating thus results in an entropy floor @xmath96 , or : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mean metallicity of the universe .",
    "this is comparable to the entropy of fossil hii regions , but has a much larger filling factor , of order unity .",
    "a metallicity of @xmath99 corresponds to roughly @xmath100 ionizing photon per baryon in the universe , both for pop ii and pop iii stars .",
    "due to recombinations , the filling factor of ionized regions will be of course considerably less than unity",
    ". however , the filling factor of _ fossil _ hii regions , which is the relevant quantity , will also be less than unity by a factor @xmath101 , which represents the overlap of hii regions with fossil hii regions which have recombined .",
    "energy spent in reionizing fossil hii regions is wasted in terms of establishing an entropy floor .",
    "this factor is likely to be large because early galaxy formation is highly biased , and higher mass halos ( which can resist feedback effects ) will be born in regions already pre - reionized by earlier generations of mini  halos . a fossil hii filling factor of order unity with little overlap can only be achieved if the formation of mini ",
    "halos is highly synchronized ( see discussion in section [ sec : reionhist ] ) .",
    "the mean free path of x - ray photons generally exceeds the mean separation between sources , becoming comparable to the hubble length for @xmath102kev photons .",
    "the entire universe is thus exposed to a fairly uniform x - ray background , and the entire igm acquires a uniform entropy floor , with an amplitude which scales with the amount of star formation , as in equation ( [ eqn : kigm_xray ] ) .",
    "even regions far from sites of star formations , which have never been engulfed in an hii region , will be affected .",
    "by contrast , in pure uv reionization scenarios , there are large spatial fluctuations in entropy , which depend on the topology of reionization , and the redshift at which a comoving patch was last ionized .    because of the relative uncertainty of the amplitude of the x - ray background , we use the entropy floor associated with fossil hii regions in the rest of this paper . the mass fraction of affected mini  halos scales with the filling factor of fossil hii regions .",
    "this is therefore a minimal estimate ; the filling factor could approach unity if x - rays are important .",
    "we now consider the effects of a finite entropy floor on mini  halo gas density profiles .",
    "once compton cooling and radiative cooling become inefficient , the gas evolves adiabatically .",
    "we can therefore compute static equilibrium density profiles , and see how they change as a function of the entropy floor .",
    "the models we construct are in the spirit of , which match observations of low - redshift cluster x - ray profiles well .",
    "naively , one might assume that only gas which remains at temperatures comparable to the virial temperatures of mini  halos would suffer appreciable jeans smoothing .",
    "since in many cases the igm can cool down to @xmath103k , one might assume that this level of preheating would have negligible effects on the density profile of gas in mini",
    "this is false : the important quantity is not the temperature but the entropy of the gas .",
    "since gas in the igm is heated at low density , it has comparatively high entropy .",
    "gas at mean density which is heated to temperatures : @xmath104 ( where @xmath31 is the overdensity of the gas in the mini  halo in the absence of preheating ) will have entropy in excess of that acquired by gravitational shock heating alone .",
    "its temperature will therefore exceed the virial temperature after infall and adiabatic compression . as the level of preheating increases , gas at progressively larger radii in the halo undergoes jeans smoothing effects .",
    "we now calculate this in detail .",
    "we first construct the default entropy profile of the gas without preheating .",
    "we assume that in the absence of heating or cooling processes , the gas distribution traces that of the dark matter , an ansatz which is indeed observed in numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) ( the dark matter is assumed to follow the nfw @xcite profile ) .",
    "this assumption becomes inaccurate at the very center of the halo , where finite gas pressure causes the gas distribution to be more flattened and less cuspy than the dark matter density distribution .",
    "in particular , even in the absence of preheating the igm has a finite temperature after decoupling from the cmb and cooling adiabatically : @xmath105^{2}$ ] , where the matter - radiation decoupling redshift @xmath106 .",
    "this gives rise to a finite entropy floor : @xmath107 independent of redshift .",
    "thus , there will be a finite core in the gas density profile even in the absence of preheating . in regions where gas traces the dark matter",
    ", hydrostatic equilibrium gives the entropy profile due to shock heating as : @xmath108.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the final entropy profile is therefore @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "note that the mean molecular weight is @xmath110 for fully ionized gas and @xmath111 for fully neutral primordial gas ; in the paper we are dealing with the case where the ionization fraction is small and therefore use the latter figure . this",
    "results in virial temperatures which are higher by a factor @xmath102 .    what is the effect of preheating on the entropy profile ?",
    "if the infall velocity does not exceed the local sound speed , then the gas is accreted adiabatically and no shock occurs ; the gas entropy @xmath112 is therefore conserved .",
    "if gas infall is supersonic , then the gas is shocked to the entropy @xmath113 computed in equation ( [ eqn : entropy_shock ] ) . found that the transition between the adiabatic accretion and shock heating regime is very sharp . to a very good approximation @xmath114 ; with this new entropy profile we can compute density and temperature profiles .",
    "in fact , for most high redshift mini  halos the preheating entropy exceeds the shock entropy even at the virial radius , so the gas mass is accreted isentropically .",
    "this occurs when the entropy floor exceeds : @xmath115 where the gas overdensity @xmath116 at the virial radius in the absence of preheating is a weak function of the nfw concentration parameter @xmath117 .",
    "although @xmath117 depends weakly on the collapse redshift , for simplicity we shall assume in this paper that @xmath118 for all mini  halos .    we have compared our entropy profiles calculated with equation  ( [ eqn : entropy_shock ] ) with the prescription in ( and also adopted by ) . in this method an accretion history for a halo is prescribed via extended press - schechter theory ; this allows one to compute the strength of the accretion shock and thus the gas entropy ( using standard rankine - hugoniot jump conditions ) for each lagrangian mass shell .",
    "the two methods agree extremely well ; we therefore use equation  ( [ eqn : entropy_shock ] ) for both speed and simplicity .    given an entropy profile , from hydrostatic equilibrium the density profile of the gas is then given by : @xmath119^{1/(\\gamma-1)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 .",
    "the temperature profile can then be determined from @xmath121 .",
    "the solution of this equation requires a boundary condition which sets the overall normalization , here expressed as @xmath122 .",
    "there is some ambiguity in this choice .",
    "the often used boundary condition @xmath123 at @xmath124 is unphysical as it does not take into account the suppression of accretion due to finite gas entropy .",
    "we make the following choice .",
    "let us define @xmath125 , the pressure at the virial radius due to shock heating alone . for @xmath126 ,",
    "the final conditions at the virial radius are not strongly affected by the entropy floor , since the shock boosts the gas onto a new adiabat .",
    "we therefore set @xmath127 .",
    "the boundary condition must change when @xmath128 , when accretion takes place isentropically , and the entropy floor is fundamental in determining the gas pressure . in this case , @xmath122 ( which is essentially a constant of integration ) is chosen so that @xmath129 as @xmath130 .",
    "the latter boundary condition implicitly assumes that hydrostatic equilibrium prevails beyond the virial radius .",
    "this is questionable , but is arguably reasonable : the gas sound speed @xmath131 in preheated gas is much higher than in cold gas , which is essentially in free - fall .",
    "the sound - crossing lengthscale over which hydrostatic equilibrium can be established , @xmath132 , is : @xmath133 which is @xmath134 times larger than the virial radius for a @xmath135k halo at the same redshift .",
    "indeed , by definition @xmath136 for jeans smoothing effects to be important .    having established the appropriate boundary conditions , we can now compute detailed gas profiles .",
    "the entropy , density , pressure and temperature profiles as a function of @xmath137 are shown in fig [ fig : halo_profiles ] .",
    "these profiles are of course universal and independent of halo mass once @xmath60 is set , if the weak dependence of the nfw concentration parameter @xmath117 with mass is ignored . as the entropy floor increases , the central pressure and density decline , while the central temperature increases .",
    "we see that reasonable values of the entropy floor @xmath65 produce dramatic effects on the gas density profile of the halo , smoothing it out considerably .",
    "we now use these density profiles to compute how the accreted gas fraction @xmath138 scales with the entropy parameter @xmath60 .",
    "this is shown as the dark solid line in fig [ fig : gas_frac ] . again , because of the self - similarity of the problem , this plot is valid for mini ",
    "halos of all virial temperatures at all redshifts , provided @xmath60 is appropriately re - scaled .",
    "it is reassuring to see that @xmath139 is continuous at @xmath140 , when we switch from one boundary condition to another .",
    "this need not have been the case , and gives us confidence that we handle the transition to isentropic accretion correctly .",
    "we see that realistic levels of the entropy floor ( as computed in ",
    "[ section : entropy_floor ] ) causes a substantial depression in gas fractions in mini  halos .",
    "it is interesting to compare our derived gas fractions with other estimates . for the case",
    "where @xmath141 , accretion takes place isentropically .",
    "the halo will therefore accrete gas at roughly the adiabatic bondi accretion rate ( e.g. , ):",
    "@xmath142 the total accreted gas mass is then roughly @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is some unknown normalization factor which takes into account the fact that the total halo mass is not constant but was lower in the past ( and hence , that the gas accretion rate was lower in the past ) .",
    "another estimate which is a good fit to the results of hydrodynamic simulations is @xcite : @xmath145^{3}}. \\label{eqn : fgas_gnedin}\\ ] ] there is only one free parameter : @xmath146 , the mass of the halo in which the gas mass fraction @xmath147 . gnedin ( 1999 ) shows that @xmath146 is well approximated by the `` filtering mass '' @xmath148 .",
    "however , @xmath148 depends on the unknown thermal history of the igm . to make a self - consistent comparison , we compute @xmath146 with the density profiles computed with our fiducial boundary conditions .",
    "interestingly , we find that @xmath146 roughly corresponds to the halo mass when accretion begins to take place isentropically @xmath149 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : gas_frac ] .",
    "all three estimates agree well ( note that the normalization @xmath144 of the bondi accretion prediction is a free parameter ; the plot shown is for @xmath150 ) .",
    "the widely used fitting formula predicts even lower gas fractions ( and as we will see , clumping factors ) at high entropy levels @xmath151 . on the other hand",
    ", the slope of the @xmath152 relation for our boundary conditions agrees very well with the bondi accretion prediction in this regime .",
    "our boundary conditions therefore yield fairly conservative estimates of the effects of preheating . moreover , unlike these other estimates , we are able to compute detailed density profiles , which is crucial for some of our later calculations .",
    "there are two other quantities which are of particular interest when computing density profiles .",
    "one is the central density @xmath153 , which affects the ability of mini  halos to form @xmath2 in the face of uv photo - dissociation .",
    "another is the gas clumping of the halo , defined as : @xmath154 where the brackets indicate a volume averaged quantity , @xmath155 note that @xmath156 always .",
    "the clumping factor @xmath157 plays a central role in determining the photon budget required for reionization ; we evaluate the global clumping factor in the following section . in figure",
    "[ fig : dual_clump_central ] , we show the effect of increasing the entropy parameter @xmath60 on the central density and clumping factor .",
    "both decline rapidly with @xmath60 .",
    "we shall use these two results in the following sections .",
    "we now use these gas density profiles to compute global effects of mini  halo suppression .",
    "an entropy floor suppresses the fraction of gas which is bound within mini  halos . as we discuss in ",
    "[ subsection:21 cm ] , the mean 21 cm emission from mini ",
    "halos is directly proportional to this global gas fraction ; if it is strongly suppressed the signal will be unobservable .",
    "the global collapsed gas fraction is : @xmath158 where @xmath159 , @xmath160 is the halo gas fraction as in figure [ fig : gas_frac ] , and @xmath161 is the comoving baryon density .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : dual_redshift_fc ] .",
    "curves are shown for no preheating @xmath162 , fixed values of the entropy floor @xmath163 ( which correspond to the igm settling to some temperature at a given redshift and remaining at constant entropy thereafter ) , and the redshift dependent entropy @xmath164 shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "2 , which reflects the increasing entropy of gas which compton cools at late epochs . for realistic values of @xmath165 ,",
    "the collapsed gas fraction is suppressed by 12 orders of magnitude .",
    "it is interesting to plot the effect of preheating on the baryonic mass function .",
    "this can be computed simply as : @xmath166 we show this in fig . [",
    "fig : plot_mass_function ] , at @xmath167 for @xmath63 as in the top panel of fig . 2 , and for a fixed entropy floor @xmath168 .",
    "as expected , the effect of preheating is most drastic at low masses .",
    "note that the baryonic mass function is very similar at all redshifts for @xmath164 ; this can be also seen in the bottom panel of [ fig : dual_redshift_fc ] , where the collapsed fraction in mini  halos does not change appreciably with redshift .",
    "another quantity of great interest is the global gas clumping factor @xmath169 .",
    "gas clumping shortens the recombination time @xmath170 and thus increases the total number of photons per baryon required to achieve reionization .",
    "it is given by : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the collapsed fraction by volume of mini  halos , @xmath173 is the clumping factor of the igm , @xmath174 is the halo clumping factor as calculated in the previous section and shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : dual_clump_central ] , and @xmath175 is the volume of a mini  halo .",
    "the factor @xmath176 deserves some explanation .",
    "halos only contribute to recombinations when they are photoionized .",
    "however , once they are exposed to ionizing radiation , they will be evaporated , essentially in the sound crossing time of photo - ionized gas @xcite . as in",
    ", we therefore set the evaporation time @xmath177 , and weight the halo clumping factor by the duty cycle @xmath178 .",
    "the clumping factor in equation [ eqn : clumping ] is a lower limit to the total gas clumping ; there will be an additional contribution from larger scales as well .",
    "however , the clumping due to minihalos is dominant at the high redshifts of interests .",
    "our result is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : dual_redshift_fc ] .",
    "for the no entropy floor @xmath179 case ( top curve ) , gas clumping is much lower at high redshift , since fewer mini ",
    "halos have collapsed .",
    "once a patch of igm is reionized early at high redshift , then an entropy floor is established and subsequent gas clumping is suppressed .",
    "thus , early star formation _ reduces _ the total photon budget required to achieve full reionization .",
    "we see that gas clumping is reduced by an order of magnitude even for the low entropy levels @xmath180 associated with reionization at high redshift @xmath181 . for the redshift - dependent entropy @xmath63 shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : khat_z ] , mini ",
    "halo clumping is strongly suppressed , and @xmath182 .",
    "@xmath6 formation and cooling in mini ",
    "halos will be suppressed relative to the no preheating case .",
    "this is because the finite entropy of the gas allows it to resist compression ; thus , the gas is at considerably lower density .",
    "collisional processes with cooling times @xmath183 will be suppressed relative to radiative processes which photo - dissociate @xmath2 .",
    "it has been recognized that gas profiles should have a central core rather than a cusp ( e.g. , ) and that lower central densities will affect @xmath2 chemistry @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that preheating can produce a much larger , lower density core than hitherto considered , and the subsequent implications for @xmath2 formation and cooling , has not been explored .    it has been shown that @xmath2 formation is enhanced in fossil hii regions due to increased electron fraction there @xcite .",
    "although @xmath2 formation is very slow in the low density igm , a high initial electron abundance will persist when weakly ionized gas is accreted onto non - linear structures , and aid @xmath2 formation at that point @xcite .",
    "we can conservatively take into account the @xmath2 enhancement by assuming the maximum initial abundance of @xmath2 , @xmath184 ; this hard upper limit is independent of density or ionization fraction and is due to freeze ",
    "out ( , hereafter oh02 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 abundance can only exceed this if three - body processes are important , which only takes place at very high density @xmath185 .",
    "in oh02 , we showed that the minimum temperature @xmath186 a parcel of gas can cool to depends almost exclusively on @xmath187 ( see figure 6 of oh02 ) .",
    "this scaling behavior is only broken when the gas approaches high densities @xmath188 ( at this point , the cooling time becomes independent of density and @xmath189 ) .",
    "however , the latter regime is never reached in pre - heated gas , which is at much lower densities ( @xmath190 corresponds to @xmath191 at @xmath28 ) . in subsequent discussion",
    ", we shall assume the dependence of @xmath186 on @xmath192 shown in figure 6 of oh02 .",
    "thus , in the presence of a radiation field @xmath193 , the gas must be at a minimum density @xmath194 to cool down to a temperature @xmath186 .",
    "we have already calculated the maximum central density @xmath195 of gas in a halo given an entropy parameter @xmath60 , as in figure [ fig : dual_clump_central ] . if the central density is less than the critical density , @xmath196 , then _",
    "none _ of the gas in the halo can cool down to @xmath186 . for a given entropy parameter @xmath60",
    ", there is therefore a minimum radiation field @xmath193 above which no gas can cool down to @xmath197 .",
    "we plot this in the top panel of figure [ fig : dual_h2_khat ] .",
    "this plot is valid for all halos at all redshifts provided @xmath60 and @xmath193 are both rescaled appropriately ( note that since @xmath198 , to keep @xmath192 constant , @xmath199 ) .",
    "to get a sense of typical values of @xmath193 , the radiation field corresponding to @xmath200 ionizing photons per baryon in the universe is @xmath201 ( where @xmath202 is the comoving baryon number density , and @xmath203 is the planck constant ) .",
    "we see that an entropy floor greatly reduces the radiation field required to prevent gas cooling . for reasonable values of @xmath60",
    ", the reduction can be as much as four orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , even if there is only a very weak radiation field , in the presence of an entropy floor effective @xmath2 cooling and star formation will be quenched .",
    "note also that the cooling time exceeds the hubble time for large values of @xmath60 .",
    "this regime is reached only when gas densities are so low that even a very weak radiation field can dissociate @xmath2 : @xmath204yr .    without an entropy floor , the density profiles of mini ",
    "halos at a given redshift are self - similar ; thus , roughly comparable fractions of their gas can cool down to @xmath186 and will be available as fuel for star formation . in the presence of an entropy floor , the fraction of gas with @xmath205 is greatly reduced , and much less gas can cool .",
    "moreover , the self - similarity is broken : shallower potential wells ( which have higher @xmath60 ) are more strongly affected by an entropy floor , and their central gas densities are much lower . using our halo density profiles , we can calculate the fraction of gas above the critical density , @xmath206 $ ] .",
    "we plot this in the lower panel of fig [ fig : dual_h2_khat ] . at some critical value of @xmath60 , the fraction of gas which can cool plummets dramatically .",
    "this value of @xmath60 corresponds roughly to when the low density core falls below the critical density .",
    "note that we assume static rather than evolving density profiles .",
    "in reality , as gas cools , densities should increase as the gas loses pressure support , making the gas more resistant to @xmath2 photo - dissociation ( machacek et al .",
    "however , the dynamical time @xmath207yr is typically much longer than the photo - dissociation time @xmath208yr ( where the factor @xmath209 takes into account self - shielding ; see discussion in section 4.2.3 of oh02 , and references therein ) .",
    "so our use of the initial density profile to estimate timescales should be approximately valid .",
    "we can also compute the critical radiation field required to suppress @xmath2 cooling down to some temperature @xmath210 as a function of redshift .",
    "we plot this in fig .",
    "[ fig : jcrit_redshift ] for a @xmath211k halo ; such a halo represents an upper mass limit to the mini  halo population .",
    "smaller halos , which have lower central densities for a given entropy floor , will require a weaker radiation field for @xmath2 cooling to be suppressed .",
    "this is shown for four different entropy floors : @xmath63 as shown in fig .",
    "2 , no preheating @xmath162 , and fixed entropy floors @xmath163 . gas cooling in fossil @xmath2 regions is very easily suppressed ; the radiation field required is 2 - 4 orders of magnitude lower than required in the no preheating case .",
    "one possible caveat is that since fossils are likely to be metal - enriched , gas cooling is dominated by metal line cooling , rather than @xmath2 cooling . we argue that this is unlikely , for two reasons : 1 ) metal line cooling only dominates @xmath2 cooling above a critical metallicity @xmath212 @xcite .",
    "this level of metal enrichment corresponds to @xmath213 ionizing photon per baryon in the universe ( where @xmath214 is the volume filling factor of metals ) .",
    "thus , metal line cooling becomes significant only at late times .",
    "2 ) after an ionizing source turns off and explodes as a supernova , the metal - polluted region is much smaller than the fossil hii region @xcite .",
    "most of the volume is therefore still of pristine composition , and undergoes the entropy floor suppression we have described .",
    "the metal - polluted region lies close to the high density peak where the very first stars formed , where in any case , more massive halos @xmath7k will collapse .",
    "to summarize : metal line cooling is therefore unlikely to spoil our assumption of adiabaticity in most of the volume of the fossil hii region .",
    "the exception is at the most highly biased density peaks , where metals can be thought of as effectively increasing the star formation efficiency .",
    "the net result is that entropy injection greatly boosts the negative feedback from early star formation : the entropy floor in reionized regions results in low density cores in the center of halos , in which @xmath2 is easily photo - dissociated by a weak external uv radiation field .",
    "it is often argued that x - rays boost @xmath2 production and cooling in mini ",
    "halos , by penetrating deep into the dense core and increasing the free electron fraction , which is critical for gas phase @xmath2 production .",
    "thus , x - rays are thought to exert a positive feedback effect , counter - acting photo - dissociation by uv radiation @xcite .",
    "we show here by fairly general arguments that x - rays in fact exert a strong _ negative _ feedback effect , due to the entropy that they inject into the igm .",
    "this prevents gas from compressing to sufficiently high density to produce @xmath2 and cool efficiently , and far outweighs any positive feedback from increasing the free electron fraction .    for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we consider an intrinsic source spectrum of the form @xmath215 where @xmath216ev and @xmath217 is the spectral break at the hydrogen lyman edge ; note that @xmath218 always .",
    "a spectrum of the form @xmath219 is characteristic of the mean spectra of quasars @xcite , as well as inverse compton emission from high - redshift sn @xcite .",
    "it is distinctive in that @xmath220=const ,",
    "i.e. , there is equal power per logarithmic interval ( though our arguments can be generalized to other spectra ) .",
    "note that the actual ionizing spectrum at any given point in the igm will be much harder , since photoelectric absorption hardens the spectrum away from the source .    what is the heating associated with this radiation field ? as we argued in ",
    "[ section : x_ray_floor ] above , all energy in the x - ray radiation field with @xmath221 ( as defined in  [ eqn : ethick ] ) will be absorbed by the igm , since the universe is optically thick at these frequencies . the radiation field",
    "may be subdivided into two components .",
    "the `` mean field '' consists of photons with @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is defined by : @xmath224 i.e. , photons with @xmath222 ( typically , @xmath225ev ) have a mean free path greater than the mean separation between sources , so that a homogeneous ionizing background is established .",
    "the `` fluctuating field '' consists of photons with @xmath226 ; this component is dominated by radiation from a single source , and is subject to large poisson fluctuations .",
    "we are interested in the heating due to the mean field , which can lead to an entropy floor even outside the hii regions of ionizing sources .",
    "it is : @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the fraction of energy of the hot photo - electron created by an x - ray which goes into heating .",
    "we have conservatively set @xmath229 ; this underestimates @xmath230 for a given @xmath231 . for the spectrum we have chosen ,",
    "the result is only logarithmically sensitive to the integration bounds ; we set @xmath232 . for steeper spectra ,",
    "@xmath233 where @xmath234 , the lower integration limit becomes important .    over a hubble time @xmath235 ,",
    "the internal energy density @xmath236 of the gas becomes : @xmath237 this make sense : since some fraction @xmath228 of the radiation field goes directly into heat , @xmath238 .",
    "thus , x - rays will heat the igm to a temperature : @xmath239 there is therefore a direct relation between the x - ray radiation field and the entropy floor : @xmath240    as we argued in  [ section : x_ray_floor ] above , the igm evolves adiabatically for @xmath241^{2.5}$ ] .",
    "what level of the radiation field does this correspond to ?",
    "for @xmath242 , about @xmath243 of the injected energy goes toward performing ionizations ; the number of photo - ionizations is simply @xmath244 .",
    "thus , we obtain : @xmath245 and so for @xmath246 , the igm evolves adiabatically ( note also that since @xmath247/15)^{-1.5}$ ] , we can ignore recombinations ) .",
    "given the entropy floor from equation [ eqn : xray_entropy ] , we can now calculate density profiles of halos .",
    "in particular , we can calculate the maximum central density of a halo from the entropy floor induced by a given x - ray background . as before , from the central density of a halo we can calculate the critical level of the lw flux @xmath193 required to suppress @xmath2 cooling down to some temperature @xmath186 .",
    "this critical flux is shown as a function of @xmath248 in fig [ fig : xray_j21 ] , for a halo of @xmath249k at @xmath28 .",
    "the curves may be simply rescaled for halos of different mass at different redshifts by translating the x - axis : @xmath250 .",
    "the effect of x - rays increases for less massive halos ( which are less able to withstand an entropy floor ) at lower redshifts ( when gas densities are lower ) . also shown are the maximum value of the x - ray background @xmath251 for the hardest sources , as well as the typical minimum value of the x - ray background required for positive feedback to be effective @xmath252 @xcite .",
    "the shaded region therefore denotes the x - ray fluxes thought to produce positive feedback effects .",
    "we see for these large values of the x - ray background , x - rays _ can not _ exert a positive feedback effect .",
    "the required x - ray background is so large that it would produce an unacceptably large entropy floor , which prevents the formation of dense regions where @xmath2 can withstand photodissociation . instead ,",
    "x - rays produce an over - all negative feedback effect .",
    "in fact , values of @xmath253 reduce by almost two orders of magnitude the value of the uv background required to photo - dissociate @xmath2 and prevent it from cooling down to low temperatures .",
    "the only way of circumventing these difficulties is if x - rays turn on suddenly at some epoch .",
    "halos which have already collapsed will be unaffected by the entropy floor , but will undergo the usual positive feedback from x - rays .",
    "however , the subsequent generation of mini  halos will be suppressed by the entropy floor .      at present , the only observational probes proposed for small - scale structure at high redshift such as mini  halos are 21 cm observations with future radio telescopes such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) and the low frequency array ( lofar ) . it has been proposed that mini  halos could be detected statistically in emission @xcite and individually in absorption along the line of sight to a high - redshift radio source @xcite .",
    "if an entropy floor exists , such signatures will be strongly suppressed .",
    "21 cm signatures of mini  halos therefore provide an interesting indirect probe of reionization history : if mini  halos _ are _ detected in large numbers at a given redshift , it would imply that the filling factor of fossil hii regions is still small at that epoch . in particular , a comoving patch where mini ",
    "halos are seen has likely never been ionized before ( which is a much stronger constraint than merely being neutral at the observed epoch ) .",
    "this could prove a very useful probe of the topology of reionization .",
    "halos are too faint to be seen individually in emission , and can only be detected statistically through brightness temperature fluctuations .",
    "provided @xmath254 ( where @xmath255 is the spin temperature ) , the 21 cm flux @xmath256 is independent of the spin temperature , and depends only on the hi mass , @xmath257 .",
    "thus , @xmath258 is simply equal to the collapsed gas mass fraction in mini  halos , which is always less than unity . the mini ",
    "halo signal is much smaller if an entropy floor exists , since the collapsed gas fraction declines rapidly : the bottom panel of figure [ fig : dual_redshift_fc ] can simply be read off as @xmath258 .",

    "the velocity field in the preheated gas will differ significantly from the bertschinger self - similar solution they assume , since gas pressure retards accretion ; the infall region optical depth will be smaller because of the reduced gas column . since even in their case the contribution of the infall region to 21",

    "the chief driver of high - redshift 21 cm proposals has of course been to observe the igm itself in 21 cm emission @xcite .",

    "such concerns are moot if a period of early reionization took place ( as seems to be indicated by _ wmap",
    "_ observations ) , followed by recombination : large tracts of warm , largely neutral gas would exist .",
    "note , however , that brightness temperature fluctuations can only be detected if the contribution from unresolved radio point sources @xcite can be successfully removed by using spectral structure in frequency space .",
    "we next address the effect of the suppression of mini  halo formation on the global reionization history .",

    "we can obtain a rough estimate for the maximum fraction of the igm that can be ionized by the mini  halos . during the lifetime of its resident ionizing source , each mini",
    " halo produces an ionized volume @xmath293 , which will correspond to the total number @xmath294 of ionizing photons injected into the igm , i.e. @xmath295 , where @xmath296 is the mean hydrogen density . to a good approximation , recombinations can be ignored in this phase , since massive stars have lifetimes shorter than the recombination time , @xmath297 ^{-3}$ ] years ( see fig .",

    "the evolution of @xmath331 in this model is shown by the upper thin solid curve in figure  [ fig : reion_xe ] ( with @xmath304 in the upper panel , and @xmath305 in the lower panel ) . as the figure shows , in the absence of other feedback effects ( see discussion in haiman , abel & rees 2000 and haiman 2003 for other feedback effects ) , the mini ",
    "halos could ionize the igm in full by @xmath332 ( @xmath304 ) , or nearly fully by @xmath333 ( if clumping is assumed to be more significant , @xmath305 ) .",

    "this is easily accomplished in practice : the suppression factor ( @xmath334 ) for the formation rate of mini ",
    "halos is replaced by a factor ( @xmath335 ) . here",
    "the fossil filling factor @xmath336 is computed the same way as the ionized fraction @xmath317 , except that the individual ionized regions are assumed to follow the dashed curves from figure  [ fig : reion_rad ] rather than the solid curves . in figure",
    "[ fig : reion_xe ] , we show the evolution of the volume filling factor @xmath336 of the fossil hii regions ( dashed curves ) , as well as the reionization history @xmath330 as the thick solid curves . finally ,",
    "for reference , we show @xmath330 with mini ",
    "halos completely excluded ( @xmath337 ) as the lower thin solid curves .    as apparent from figure",
    "[ fig : reion_rad ] , the exclusion of new mini  halo formation from the fossil hii regions causes a significant suppression of the total ionized fraction that can be reached by mini  halos . under the rather optimistic set of assumptions described by the thick solid curve in the upper panel , the maximum ionized fraction that can be reached is @xmath338 . in reality , clumping is unlikely to be unity in the immediate vicinity ( @xmath339 kpc ) of the ionizing sources ( haiman , abel & madau 2000 ) .    the total electron scattering optical depth attributable to mini  halos ( the appropriately weighted integral between the thick solid curve and the lower thin solid curve ) is @xmath340 and @xmath341 in the @xmath304 and @xmath305 cases , respectively .",
    "this makes it unlikely that mini ",
    "halos can fully account for the large optical depth @xmath342 measured by _",
    "note the thick curve in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : reion_xe ] has a total @xmath343 ( @xmath340 attributable to minihalos , and @xmath344 to larger halos ) , so that it is consistent with the _ wmap _ measurement .",
    "note that raising the efficiencies in mini  halos would not increase the optical depth attributed to minihalos , since feedback then would set in earlier ( we have explicitly verified that @xmath285 is approximately independent of efficiencies over a range of multiplicative factors 0.1 - 10 for @xmath345 ) .",
    "finally , note that the suppression considered here and shown in figure  [ fig : reion_xe ] provides a negative feedback _ in addition _ to the negative feedback expected from @xmath346 photodissociation ( haiman , rees & loeb 1997 ; haiman , abel & rees 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , as discussed above , preheating _ amplifies _ the effect of the @xmath347-photodissociative negative feedback .    because an entropy floor essentially eliminates gas clumping due to mini - halos ( as shown in section [ subsection : coll_clump ] ) , the reionization history is likely to more closely approximate the c=1 case than the c=10 case until low redshifts @xmath348 ( when gas clumping due to larger structures predominates ) .",
    "an entropy floor therefore has two countervailing effects on reionization : by suppressing star formation in mini  halos , it reduces the comoving emissivity .",
    "however , by reducing gas clumping , it also reduces the photon budget required for reionization .",
    "it is interesting to note that that the evolution of the filling factor is non - monotonic for the c=1 case : feedback due to early reionization naturally produces a bump in the comoving emissivity , and a pause ensues before larger halos ( which can resist feedback ) collapse .",
    "this is similar to the reionization histories derived by @xcite , but is regulated by feedback from the entropy floor rather than a pop iii to pop ii transition due to a universal metallicity increase .",
    "in this paper , motivated by the _ wmap _ results",
    ", we have considered the feedback effect of early reionization / preheating on structure formation .",
    "this feedback effect is _ inevitable _ in any reionization scenario in which star formation throughout the universe is not completely synchronized .",
    "our principal conclusions are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "fossil hii regions have a residual entropy floor after recombination and compton cooling which is _ higher _ than the shock entropy for mini  halos ( @xmath349k ) ; thus , such halos accrete gas isentropically .",
    "the igm entropy depends primarily on the redshift and only weakly on the overdensity @xmath31 ; it is thus largely independent of the details of structure formation .",
    "for this reason , and also because it is conserved during adiabatic accretion or hubble expansion , the gas entropy is a more fundamental variable to track than the temperature .",
    "we provide a simple analytic formula for the temperature ( and hence entropy @xmath350 ) , in equations [ eqn : t_analytic ] and [ eqn : t_rec ] .",
    "an early x - ray background would also heat the entire igm to similarly high adiabats .",
    "the entropy floor due to the latter would be much more spatially uniform .",
    "we apply the entropy formalism used to calculate the effect of preheating on low - redshift galaxy clusters to the high  redshift minihalos .",
    "we obtain detailed gas density and pressure profiles , which we use to calculate the impact of preheating on the central density , accreted gas fraction , gas clumping factor , and mini  halo baryonic mass function .",
    "these quantities can then be used to calculate global effects of preheating .",
    "the collapsed gas fraction in minihalos falls by @xmath351 orders of magnitude , while the gas clumping factor falls to @xmath352 , as for a uniform igm .",
    "an entropy floor reduces the photon budget required for full reionization by about an order of magnitude , by reducing gas clumping and eliminating the need for mini ",
    "halos to be photo - evaporated before reionization can be completed .",
    ". however , an entropy floor does not necessarily promote early reionization : it also sharply reduces the comoving emissivity . by reducing the central gas densities in mini ",
    "halos , preheating impedes @xmath2 formation and cooling , and reduces the critical uv background required for @xmath2 suppression by 2 - 4 orders of magnitude . _",
    "thus , once a comoving patch of the igm is reionized , no subsequent star formation in mini ",
    "halos can take place in that volume .",
    "_ the patch can only be reionized by more massive halos @xmath353k , which can undergo atomic cooling . by furnishing an entropy floor ,",
    "x - rays also suppress @xmath2 formation . thus",
    ", contrary to conventional wisdom , x - rays provide negative rather than positive feedback for early star formation .",
    "mini - halos will not be observable in 21 cm emission / absorption in fossil hii regions .",
    "thus , 21 cm observations provide an unusual probe of the topology of reionization : mini - halos trace out regions of the igm which have _ never _ been ionized . if mini - halos are seen in large numbers , this places an upper limit on the filling factor of fossil hii regions and the x - ray background at that redshift .",
    "we have computed the reionization histories as in hh03 , but taking the feedback effect of an entropy floor ( and reduction of gas clumping ) into account .",
    "the strong feedback in fossil hii regions imply that hii fronts at high redshift never overlap , and global reionization at high redshift does not occur .",
    "this limits the contribution of mini  halos to the reionization optical depth @xmath354 , almost independent of star formation efficiency in mini  halos ( if star formation is more efficient , feedback sets in earlier ) .",
    "thus , the bulk of the optical depth observed by wmap must come from more massive objects",
    "strikingly , we obtain a double - peaked reionization history : an early peak in which the universe is filled with fossil hii regions , followed by a pause before more massive halos collapse which finally fully reionize the universe .",
    "this is similar to double reionization scenarios computed by other authors ( e.g. ) , but one in which the the comoving emissivity is regulated by gas entropy , rather than a pop iii to pop ii transition due to a universal metallicity increase .",
    "this last point deserves additional comment .",
    "a metallicity - regulated evolution of the emissivity requires that metal pollution is fairly spatially uniform",
    ". however , different parts of the igm likely undergo the pop iii to pop ii transition at different epochs .",
    "furthermore , an increase in metallicity does not necessarily result in a drop in the overall emissivity : metal line cooling likely results in a larger star formation efficiency in halos , since metals are not subject to internal uv photo - dissociation , unlike @xmath2 .",
    "the factor of @xmath35510 drop in the hi ionizing emissivity per stellar baryon could be outweighed by the increase in the total mass of stars formed . in comparison , we argue that an entropy - regulated transition is inevitable , and therefore more robust .",
    "this is an important conclusion , given the possibility that future cmb polarization studies will be able to distinguish among different reionization histories ( hh03 ; holder et al 2003 ) .    in this semi - analytic study",
    ", we essentially assumed a single value of the entropy floor at each redshift , for all halos . in reality , as we discussed above , there should be large fluctuations in entropy , depending on the topology / history of reionization and the accretion / merger history of halos",
    ". it would be interesting to study these effects in detail in three dimensional numerical simulations . to begin with , it would be interesting to re - run existing simulations of the collapse of gas in mini  halos , but adding an entropy floor in the initial conditions .",
    "such studies could quantify more precisely the effects of an entropy floor in suppressing @xmath2 formation and cooling in mini  halos .",
    "in fact , since densities are lower and gas cooling is reduced , it should be a computationally more tractable problem . with the aid of larger volumes , several global issues mentioned above could be addressed : for instance , a global , self - consistent study of feedback as in , but including the effects of both the entropy floor _ and _ uv feedback . because of its strong effect on the evolution of the comoving emissivity , gas entropy acts as a self - regulating mechanism which likely has a strong influence in controlling the progress of reionization .",
