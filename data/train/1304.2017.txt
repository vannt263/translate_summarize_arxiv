    "optoacoustic tomography ( oat ) , also known as photoacoustic computed tomography , is an emerging imaging modality that has great potential for a wide range of biomedical imaging applications @xcite . in oat , a short laser pulse",
    "is employed to irradiate biological tissues .",
    "when the biological tissues absorb the optical energy , acoustic wave fields can be generated via the thermoacoustic effect .",
    "the acoustic wave fields propagate outward in three - dimensional ( 3d ) space and are measured by use of ultrasonic transducers that are distributed outside the object .",
    "the goal of oat is to obtain an estimate of the absorbed energy density map within the object from the measured acoustic signals . to accomplish this ,",
    "an image reconstruction algorithm is required .",
    "a variety of analytic image reconstruction algorithms have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these algorithms generally assume an idealized transducer model and an acoustically homogeneous medium .",
    "also , since they are based on discretization of continuous reconstruction formulae , these algorithms require the acoustic pressure to be densely sampled over a surface that encloses the object to obtain an accurate reconstruction . to overcome these limitations , iterative image reconstruction algorithms",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "although the optoacoustic wave intrinsically propagates in 3d space , when applying to experimental data , most studies have employed two - dimensional ( 2d ) imaging models by making certain assumptions on the transducer responses and/or the object structures @xcite .",
    "an important reason is because the computation required for 3d oat image reconstruction is excessively burdensome .",
    "therefore , acceleration of 3d image reconstruction will facilitate algorithm development and many applications including real - time 3d pact @xcite .",

    "compute unified device architecture ( cuda ) is an extension of the c / fortran language that provides a convenient programming platform to exploit the parallel computational power of gpus @xcite .",
    "the cuda - based parallel programming technique has been successfully applied to accelerate image reconstruction in mature imaging modalities such as x - ray computed tomography ( ct ) @xcite and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) @xcite . in oat , however , only a few works on utilization of gpus to accelerate image reconstruction have been reported @xcite .",
    "for example , the k - wave toolbox employs the nvidia cuda fast fourier transform library ( cufft ) to accelerate the computation of 3d fft @xcite .",
    "also a gpu - based sparse matrix - vector multiplication strategy has been applied to 3d oat image reconstruction for the case that the system matrix is sparse and can be stored in memory @xcite .",
    "however , there remains an important need to develop efficient implementations of oat reconstruction algorithms for general applications in which the system matrix is too large to be stored .",
    "in this work , we propose parallelization strategies , for use with gpus , to accelerate 3d image reconstruction in oat .",
    "both filtered backprojection ( fbp ) and iterative image reconstruction algorithms are investigated . for use with iterative image reconstruction algorithms ,",
    "we focus on the parallelization of projection and backprojection operators .",
    "specifically , we develop two pairs of projection / backprojection operators that correspond to two distinct discrete - to - discrete ( d - d ) imaging models employed in oat , namely the interpolation - based and the spherical - voxel - based d - d imaging models .",
    "note that our implementations of the backprojection operators compute the exact adjoint of the forward operators , and therefore the projector pairs are ` matched ' @xcite .",

    "a gpu card contains multiple streaming multiprocessors .",
    "each streaming multiprocessor is configured with multiple processor cores .",

    "one of the major challenges is to design a parallelization strategy fitting in the simd framework such that the largest number of processor cores can execute the computation simultaneously @xcite .",
    "a gpu card has six types of memory that have varying capacities and different access rules and efficiencies : ( 1 ) registers are assigned for each thread and have the fastest access .",
    "( 2 ) shared memory is assigned for each block and can be efficiently accessed by all threads in the block if designed appropriately .",
    "( 3 ) constant memory is read - only and can be accessed by all threads efficiently .",

    "( 5 ) global memory has the slowest access that takes hundreds times more clock cycles than does the computation of basic arithmetic operations . ( 6 ) local memory is assigned for each thread but has a slow access as does the global memory .",

    "the major difference is that calculation of each element of the data vector for the spherical - voxel - based imaging model requires the accumulation of the contributions from all voxels because the model is expressed in the temporal frequency domain . because of this , the amount of computation required to calculate each data sample in the spherical - voxel - based imaging model is almost identical , simplifying the parallelization strategy .",

    "discrete samples of @xmath81 defined in eqn .   were precalcualted and stored as a vector @xmath138 in constant memory . because the size of the input vector @xmath139 is often too large to fit in the constant memory , we divided @xmath139 into sub - vectors that matched the capacity of the constant memory .",
    "we employed a cpu loop to copy every sub - vector sequentially to the constant memory and call the gpu kernel function to accumulate a partial summation .",
