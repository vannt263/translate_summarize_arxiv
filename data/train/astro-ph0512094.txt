    "the search for pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars in young stellar systems of the galaxy and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) has verified their existence from both ground - based and space observations .",
    "hillenbrand et al . ( 1993 ) observed the galactic open cluster ngc 6611 `` in the act of forming intermediate - mass stars '' of 3 - 8 m. they found that high - mass stars of age @xmath2 myr coexist with a pms population as young as 0.25 myr , suggesting that the massive stars did not alter the star formation process .",
    "brandl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using vlt / isaac observations revealed a pms population in ngc 3603 , which is the most massive hii region in the galaxy .",
    "recent wfpc2 imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) showed that the cmd position of stars fainter than @xmath3 mag indicates pms stars with masses down to 0.1 m with an age between 0.3 - 1 myr ( stolte et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in the lmc , brandl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) detected with near - infrared imaging of the central cluster of 30 doradus ( r 136 ) 108 `` extremely red sources '' , which are most likely pms stars of masses down to @xmath0 3 m. pms stars in r 136 were originally revealed by hunter et al .",
    "( 1995 ) with hst / wfpc2 observations .",
    "a red population with masses down to @xmath0 1.35 m , well tracked by pms isochrones of ages 1 - 10 myr , was also discovered in r 136 by sirianni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from hst / wfpc2 , although no variable extinction was taken into account ( brandl & andersen 2005 ) .",
    "hst / nicmos observations showed that in the region of 30 doradus there are stars of lower mass down to 0.4 m ( zinnecker 1998 ) with no evidence for a lower mass cutoff ( brandner et al .",
    "romaniello et al .",
    "( 2005 ) identified a population of objects with h and/or balmer continuum excess , which they interpret as low mass ( @xmath0 1 - 2 m ) pms stars .",
    "as far as non - star - burst young stellar systems are concerned , ( e.g. stellar associations ) , studies in our galaxy have revealed their pms population , but such stars _ have not yet been detected , although they should exist also in stellar associations of the magellanic clouds ( mcs)_. according to massey et al .",
    "( 1995 ) the regions of galactic ob associations show evidence of pms stars with masses between 5 - 10 m and ages @xmath4 1 myr .",
    "preibisch & zinnecker ( 1999 ) discovered 95 low - mass pms stars with an age of @xmath0 5 myr in the upper scorpius ob association and they suggest a coevality in the formation of low- and high - mass stars .",
    "recent studies of the orion ob1 association revealed its pms population in the mass range 0.2 - 2 m ( sherry et al .",
    "2004 ; briceo et al .",
    "the only comparable study in the mcs is the one around sn 1987a by panagia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who identified several hundreds pms stars through their h emission , and they found that most of them have masses in the range 1 - 2 m and ages between 1 - 2 and 20 myr .    associations in the mcs _ are close enough for low - mass stars to be observed _ with high - resolution ground - based and space imaging , and they _ do not suffer from crowding or high extinction _ , like the star - burst of 30 doradus or compact young clusters . therefore , _ if pms stars are to be found in extra - galactic stellar systems , stellar associations of the mcs should be considered as the best places to search_. in this letter we report the serendipitous discovery of low - mass candidate pms stars found with hst / wfpc2 in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the lmc association lh 52 earlier published by gouliermis , brandner & henning ( 2005a , from here on paper i ) .",
    "the wfpc2 images on the association lh 52 were taken within the hst program go-8134 .",
    "wfpc2 data of the background lmc field in the area  observed within the hst program go-8059  are also used .",
    "details for both datasets are given in paper i. results on the initial mass function ( imf ) of the general lmc field with wfpc2 observations have been recently presented by gouliermis , brandner & henning ( 2005b , from here on paper ii ) .",
    "these observations ( hst program go-8576 ) , which consist of six sequential telescope pointings of the inner lmc disk , described in paper ii , are also used here .",
    "the photometry was performed with the package hstphot ( dolphin 2000 ) , and is described in detail in papers i and ii .      in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 cmd of the association lh 52 constructed in paper i from hst / wfpc2 observations , a secondary red sequence of faint stars can be seen easily almost parallel to the lower main sequence from the turn - off down to the detection limit ( figure 6 of paper i ) . in paper",
    "i we discuss the fact that this reddened _ sequence _ can not be seen in the cmd of the local background field .",
    "there are two reasons for _ not _ interpreting it as a `` normal '' cmd feature : ( 1 ) the _ sequence _ can not be accounted for by binaries of main sequence stars , because it is located more than one magnitude away from the zams .",
    "( 2 ) it can not be the result of broadening of the main - sequence due to photometric errors , because in that case there would be a noisy stellar distribution rather than a well formed sequence .",
    "the numbers of stars in the _ sequence _ with colors 5@xmath7 away from the zams give additional evidence that this feature is not due to errors in the colors .",
    "for example , the expected number of 5@xmath7 outliers with 23.0 @xmath8 23.5 mag is @xmath0 5 , given the total number of stars in this magnitude range , while we find that 45 stars of the _ sequence _ are located further than 5@xmath7 away from the main sequence .",
    "the corresponding numbers for stars with 23.5 @xmath8 24.0 mag are about 9 expected and 55 counted stars located more than 5@xmath7 to the red of the zams . on the other hand there are facts , which support the suggestion that the _ sequence _ can be accounted for by a pms population in the area of the association lh 52 .",
    "first , the pms evolutionary models of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) seem to trace very well the _ sequence_.",
    "the wfpc2 cmd of lh 52 is shown again in figure [ lh52pmscmdiso ] ( left panel ) with indicative pms isochrones of ages between 1.5 and 15 myr overplotted .",
    "we selected @xmath0 500 stars , which form the _ sequence _ and we plot with thick points their loci in the enlarged faint red part of the cmd ( figure [ lh52pmscmdiso ] right panel ) .",
    "the limit for the brightest of the selected stars is chosen in a way that any confusion with the stellar population of the turn - off can be avoided .",
    "still , pms stars brighter than this limit are expected to exist according to the models .",
    "the distance modulus used is @xmath9 mag ( panagia et al .",
    "1991 ) and the isochrones are reddened for @xmath10 mag ( paper i ) . the excellent agreement of the _ sequence _ with the pms isochrones shown in figure [ lh52pmscmdiso ] gives the first evidence that these stars are of pms nature .    a second evidence for the pms population of lh 52 can be seen in figure [ fig_hess ] , which shows the differential hess diagrams created by subtracting the scaled hess diagram of lh 52 from the ones of the close - by general lmc field ( paper i ) and of the background field of the lmc inner disk ( paper ii ) .",
    "the cmds were binned in 0.02 mag intervals in @xmath6 and 0.05 mag in @xmath5 , and normalized such that the total number of stars were equal .",
    "the resulting images are the hess diagrams used to produce figure [ fig_hess ] .",
    "the blackest pixels represent a stellar excess in the field of lh 52 , and the whitest pixels show a stellar excess in the background fields .",
    "the differences between the areas are dramatically highlighted , especially in the case of the lmc disk field ( right panel ) , which is characterized by excellent photometry ( with longer exposure times ) of a rich sample of over 80,000 stars . in the case of the close - by field ( left panel )",
    "it is shown that the lower main - sequence of this cmd , which is broadened due to photometric errors does not cover the _",
    "sequence_. the differential hess diagrams emphasize the fact that the population covered by the secondary faint _ sequence _ does not have any counterpart in the general field of the lmc .",
    "this strengthens the suggestion that _ the sequence represents pms stars in the association and not low - mass stars on its main - sequence_.    in addition to the discussion above , we consider the observational cmds recently published for the low - mass pms stars of the orion ob1 association in the galaxy .",
    "sherry et al . (",
    "2004 ) presented their @xmath11 survey of the low - mass pms population of the ori ob1b sub - association .",
    "the location of the pms stars in their @xmath5 , @xmath12 cmd matches almost perfectly our _ sequence _ , if compared at the same distance .",
    "furthermore , briceo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) presented the cida variability survey of ori ob1 and their @xmath5 , @xmath12 cmd shows a sequence of red faint stars almost `` 1 magnitude above the zams '' .",
    "the location in the observed cmd of their brighter stars , which are identified as t tauri stars with @xmath13  -2.truept  2 m , is in excellent agreement with our _ sequence _ , if we take the distance of the lmc into account . in both studies",
    "the comparison of the cmd at the area of ori ob1 with cmds of  control \" fields away from it proves that the pms stars belong only to the association .",
    "this coincidence of the loci of low - mass pms stars in the cmd of a galactic association with the observed faint red _ sequence _ seen in our cmd of lh 52 gives additional confidence that _ this sequence accounts for the pms population of the association_.",
    "if we assume that the stars of the _ sequence _ are indeed pms stars , we can study the low - mass pms initial mass spectrum ( ims ) of lh 52 .",
    "the construction of such a distribution function would require a procedure more thorough than the `` typical '' construction of a mass - luminosity ( m / l ) relation based on isochrone models .",
    "since pms isochrones of different ages are so close to each other ( see figure [ lh52pmscmdiso ] ) , it is very difficult to establish an accurate m / l relation , because it is not possible to know the exact age of each pms star .",
    "a more efficient process for distributing these stars according to their masses is to count them directly on the cmd . from the models of siess",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) we construct `` evolutionary '' tracks ( of equal mass ) between isochrones of ages starting from 0.5 myr up to 15 myr .",
    "these  iso - mass \" tracks , provide the mass bins in which the pms stars will be counted for the construction of their ims ( figure [ fig_imf ] left panel ) .",
    "completeness at the magnitude ranges of our candidate pms stars plays an important role . as shown in figure [ fig_imf ] (",
    "left panel ) , only stars with masses down to 0.8 m can be used due to incompleteness .",
    "in addition , since we strictly select the brightest limit of the _ sequence _ to be well below the turn - off , the numbers of counted stars in the higher - mass bins are also incomplete .",
    "we consider that numbers for stars up to 1.4 m are useful .",
    "the ims , which is constructed by counting stars between evolutionary tracks , is plotted in figure [ fig_imf ] ( right panel ) .",
    "its logarithmic slope ) is related to the slope @xmath14 of the imf as @xmath15 .",
    "thus a salpeter ims has @xmath16 ( see also scalo 1986 ) . ] , which is @xmath17 , is calculated by applying a least - square linear fit for stars within the useful mass range of 0.8 @xmath18/m @xmath19 1.4 .",
    "the ims slope is almost identical to a salpeter ( 1955 ) ims , equal to @xmath20 .",
    "this slope should be considered only as indicative due to poor statistics .",
    "indeed , the large uncertainty demonstrates the need for more complete data for pms stars in mcs associations .",
    "we provide evidence of the possible existence of pms stars in the vicinity of a _ bona - fide _ stellar association in the lmc .",
    "the study presented here can not be treated as a direct proof of their existence , but it should be considered as an initial step for the investigation of faint red sources located in the vicinity of star - forming mcs associations .",
    "recent acs observations of the bright association ngc 346 in the small magellanic cloud revealed `` an underlying population of 2,500 infant stars embedded in the nebula '' ( stsci press release stsci - prc2005 - 04 ) .",
    "it is almost certain that deep observations with hst / acs of such systems will provide more detailed information .",
    "furthermore , high - resolution near - infrared observations should be performed as follow - up to an acs detection in the optical and h for the characterization of these red sources .",
    "such a multi - wavelength set of data will help to characterize the pms population of stellar associations of the mcs , and to deal with important issues such as _ how long does it take for the pre - main sequence phase in mcs associations to be completed _ , and _ how important is the role of mcs lower metallicities for this timescale_.    this paper is based on observations made with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained from the data archive at the space telescope science institute .",
