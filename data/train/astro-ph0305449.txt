    ". however , its most astonishing characteristic is the chemical inhomogeneity : @xmath0  cen is the only ggc that shows clear and undisputed variations not only in the light elements abundances , but also in its overall metallicity . from this point of view , @xmath0  cen could be considered a `` bridge '' between the common globulars , which are unable to retain the gas ejected by their former massive stars , and the dwarf galaxies , which are the least massive self - enriching stellar systems known .",
    "it is interesting to note that those dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) that are less luminous than @xmath0  cen ( e.g. ursa minor , draco and carina ) show modest abundance spreads with respect to this cluster .",
    "the metallicity distribution of @xmath0  cen red giant branch ( rgb ) stars was derived by means of low resolution spectroscopy ( see for example norris et al . 1996 or suntzeff & kraft 1996 ) , showing its main peak at [ fe / h]=@xmath5 with a long extended tail to higher metallicities and a possible secondary peak at about [ fe / h]@xmath6 .",
    "recently , wide field photometric studies of @xmath0  cen ( lee et al .",
    "1999 and pancino et al .",
    "2000 ) have revealed the complex structure of the rgb of @xmath0  cen .",
    "in particular , the presence of an additional well detached sequence , previously unknown , to the red side of the rgb ( figure  [ wfi ] ) has been discovered . according to pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , three main sub - populations can be identified in the rgb distribution of @xmath0  cen : _ ( i ) _ the main , metal - poor population ( rgb - mp ) , with [ fe / h]=@xmath5 and comprising @xmath7 of the rgb population ; _ ( ii ) _ the rgb - mint , comprising the secondary peak at [ fe / h]@xmath6 together with the long tail extending to higher metallicity , comprising @xmath8 of the rgb ; _ ( iii ) _ the additional rgb - a recently identified , that appears to be the most metal - rich component in @xmath0  cen ( [ fe / h]=@xmath9 , pancino et al .",
    "2002 ) and comprises only @xmath10 of the rgb population .",
    "we have started a long term project devoted to the photometric and spectroscopic study of the various sub - populations in @xmath0  cen , which is described in ferraro et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and in pancino et al .",
    "i present here the first , preliminary results from the optical , high - resolution survey conducted with uves mounted at the eso vlt , which has been undertaken to investigate on the chemical properties of the rgb - a population , which was never studied with high - resolution spectroscopy before .",
    "cen is plotted as small dots , where the targets of the uves survey are marked with large circles : _ empty circles _ for the rgb - mp and rgb - mint stars that have not been analyzed yet , _ filled circles _ for the rgb - a and rgb - mint stars that are presented in this contribution.,width=302 ]    the principal aim of the observations was to cover the rgb - a along its full extension in a homogeneous way while having , at the same time , a good number of rgb - mint and rgb - mp giants in common with previous high - resolution abundance studies of @xmath0  cen . in particular , the attention has been concentrated so far on the most metal - rich stars in the sample , mostly belonging to the rgb - a and rgb - mint populations ( figure  [ targets ] ) .",
    "observations were conducted during three different observing runs with uves at the eso vlt in paranal , chile .",
    "all the spectra have high - resolution ( @xmath11 ) and high signal to noise ratios ( see table  [ logs ] ) . the first run ( run  a )",
    "was carried out in june 2000 , as a backup while the main targets were not visible , and six stars were observed covering a wide wavelength range ( 35009000 , with gaps around 5000   and 7000 ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis of these stars has been already published by pancino et al .",
    "the rest of the sample has been observed in april 2001 ( run  b ) , with a slightly different setup , covering the range 35007000 , with two gaps around 4600  and 5800 .",
    "two additional stars have been added during the last observing run in march 2002 ( run  c ) , using the same setup as in run  b.    a summary of the stars properties is presented in table  [ logs ] .",
    "colors and magnitudes are from the wide field ccd @xmath12 and @xmath13 photometry published by pancino et al .",

    ". a complete analysis of the dataset should thus add more information and statistics , but we do not expect it to alter significantly the abundances obtained up to now .    a first result concerns the average metallicity of the rgb - a , which turns out to be [ fe / h]@xmath18 , perfectly compatible with what obtained by pancino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , with of course a lower error due to to the higher number of stars .",
    "moreover , as expected , the detailed chemical abundance ratios of the iron - peak elements analyzed appear to be roughly solar at all [ fe / h ] values , although some of them , like v and sc , appear slightly higher than solar : a detailed spectral synthesis of each line , including hyperfine structure may lower these values ( see e.g. smith 2002 ) .",

    "( 2000 ) ( _ small empty circles_).,width=302 ]    we obtained a single [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance by averaging mg , si , ca and ti . while the abundance measurements of si , ca and ti are quite safe since they are based on a few tens of lines each , the ones for mg are slighly more uncertain being based on less than ten lines . for oxygen , the situation is even more delicate since the only available lines are the forbidden [ o  i ] lines at 6300    and 6363   , both falling inside one tio band that is most disturbing for the coolest stars ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the @xmath20  o@xmath21 telluric band falls also in that region since the radial velocitiy of @xmath0  cen stars is around @xmath22  km  s@xmath23 . as a result , only a sub - sample of the stars anlyzed so far has reliable o abundances .    due to these problems",
    ", we decided to exclude oxygen from the estimate of the overall @xmath1-enhancement presented in figure  [ alpha ] , where our measurements are compared with the results published by norris & da costa ( 1995 ) and smith et al .",
    "the first thing to note is that , even if we did not perform a detailed star - by - star comparison , our measurements in the region @xmath24[fe / h]@xmath25 ( the rgb - mint ) appear in reasonable agreement with the literature values .",
    "another interesting effect concerns the rgb - mp stars with @xmath26[fe / h]@xmath27 , which appear to have a slightly lower @xmath1-enhancement with respect to the rgb - mint stars _ measured from the same authors_. as recently discussed by shetrone et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , a low and constant @xmath1-enhancement , in a metallicity regime where sne  ia did not play any rle , indicates that any enrichment due to sne  ii must have been driven preferentially by lower mass sne  ii , i.e. , with @xmath28 . a more detailed study of the single @xmath1-elements , on a large sample of giants of all metallicities is thus urgently needed ( see also the contribution by verne smith , in these proceedings ) .    however , the most interesting result obtained here is that the rgb - a stars have , on average , a lower enhancement with respect to the rgb - mint ones , confirming the results of pancino et al .",
    "thus , if these stars formed from the @xmath1-enriched ejecta of the previous generations of stars in @xmath0  cen ( like the rgb - mint , for example ) then _ the only way to lower the @xmath1-enhancement would be a further enrichment by sne  ia_.    in order to firmly disentangle contributions of sne  ii from sne  ia , it is necessary to identify appropriate _",
    "tracers _ ,",
    "i.e. , elements that , unlike the @xmath1-elements and the iron - peak elements , are produced _ almost exclusively _ ( @xmath29100% ) by only one type of sne .",
    "for example , while eu appears as a good tracer of sne  ii enrichment , cu and mn appear as promising tracers of sne  ia , although their effective production mechanisms are still quite debated . to derive accurate abundances of eu , cu and mn",
    ", a full spectral synthesis of the line profile is required , since they possess hyperfine structure .",
    "lines of these elements are present in our uves spectra , so their analysis is the next urgent task .",
    "-element abundance is plotted as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines mark the solar and ten times solar [ @xmath2/fe ] reference values .",
    "the vertical dotted line separates the rgb - a ( [ fe / h]>-0.75 ) from the rgb - mint and rgb - mp populations .",
    "the uves measurements ( _ filled circles _ ) are compared with the measurements by norris & da costa ( 1995 ) , smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and vanture et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( _ small empty circles_).,width=302 ]      the next set of derived abundances concerns the @xmath2-process elements y , zr , ba , la , ce and nd , which are mainly produced in agb stars ( busso et al .",
    "these are some of the best studied @xmath2-process elements , although their measurements for red giants are often based on a handful of lines , so that even one single uncertain log  gf value can produce significant variations on the final abundance .",
    "this is especially true , in the present case , for ce and la , that could be measured only in a few stars , and anyway resulted in scattered abundance trends .    to try to compensate for these drawbacks , we averaged the four most reliable elements , y , zr , ba and nd to produce a global [ @xmath2/fe ] ratio . in figure",
    "[ esse ] , our measurements are compared with literature results by norris & da costa ( 1995 ) , smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and vanture et al .",
    "while the last two studies , based on more updated atomic data , appear in good agreement with our determinations , the data by norris & da costa ( 1995 ) had to be shifted by @xmath30  dex ( a value determined using the only star in common , roa  371 ) to produce a satisfactory agreement .",
    "this has to be ascribed entirely to the choice of log  gfs .",
    "figure  [ esse ] confirms what already found in the past for the rgb - mp and rgb - mint populations : a dramatic increase of the @xmath2-process overabundance is clearly seen for rgb - mp stars up to approximately [ fe / h]@xmath31 , followed by a flattening out , or at least a break in the slope , for the rgb - mint stars .",
    "smith ( 2002 ) noticed that this break in slope , if true , appears exactly at the metallicity that separates the rgb - mp from the rgb - mint .",
    "concerning the rgb - a , we see that it shows the same enrichment level of the rgb - mint , i.e. , ten times higher than the solar value .",
    "the likely interpretation is that the rgb - mint and the rgb - a were similarly enriched by low mass agb stars ejecta .",
    "this continuity of properties between the rgb - mint and the rgb - a is somehow in contrast with the discontinous behaviour of their @xmath1-enhancement .",

    "uves measurements ( _ filled circles _ ) are compared with the literature measurements as in figure  [ esse ] ( _ small empty circles _ ) . the heavy ( _ top panel _ ) and light ( _ middle panel _ ) @xmath2-process elements ratios , [ @xmath32/fe ] and [ @xmath33/fe ] are plotted against [ fe / h ] , together with their ratio ( _ bottom panel _ ) [ @xmath32/@xmath33].,width=264 ]    to further investigate on the source of @xmath2-process enrichment , we used an indicator of the neutron exposure , or efficiency of the @xmath2-process : the ratio [ @xmath32/@xmath33 ] between heavy and light @xmath2-process elements .",
    "we computed these ratios by averaging ba with nd for the heavy component and y with zr for the light component .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ hsls ] , where uves measurements are compared with literature results , as above .    the clear overabundance of heavy @xmath2-sprocess elements with respect to the light ones points towards low mass ( 1.5@xmath353  @xmath36 ) agb stars as the main enriching source for @xmath0  cen , through the @xmath37c(@xmath1,@xmath38)@xmath39o reaction that takes place in the interpulse period ( busso et al .",
    "1999 ) . the rgb - a makes no exception , showing again a perfect continuity of properties with the rgb - mint .",
    "the literature data from figures  [ alpha ] and [ esse ] suggest that the rgb - mp and the rgb - mint sub - populations have been simultaneously enriched by sne  ii and low mass agb stars ( see norris & da costa 1995 and smith et al .",
    "this poses a well known problem , concerning the enrichment timescales of these two contributors .",
    "in particular , the timescales of enrichment by sne  ii are thought to be extremely short ( @xmath40  gyr ) , so the hypothesis was made that @xmath0  cen reached [ fe / h]@xmath41 in such a short time , i.e. , soon after a burst of star formation .",
    "however , the lifetime of a 1.5@xmath353  @xmath36 agb star is of 13  gyr ( castellani , chieffi & straniero 1990 ) , so agb stars took _ at least _ 13  gyr to enrich stars with [ fe / h]@xmath42 , where the break in the [ @xmath2/fe ] slope with [ fe / h ] appears .",
    "concerning the rgb - a , as already said , we also have some contradictory evidence .",
    "we see a remarkable continuity of properties with the other rgb sub - populations  especially with the rgb - mint  when we look at the enrichment in @xmath2-process elements , where [ @xmath2/fe]@xmath43 at all metallicities ( figure  [ esse ] ) .",
    "we see instead a clearly discontinuous behaviour in the @xmath1-enhancement , suggesting some additional enrichment by sne  ia ( figure  [ alpha ] ) ."
