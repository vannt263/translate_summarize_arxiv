    "there exist many controversial models to explain how copper enhances the activity of such zno  based catalysts.@xcite different `` active species '' are proposed in the literature , like the existence of cu@xmath2 impurities at the zno surfaces , but the most commonly accepted picture is that cu forms small metallic clusters which are dispersed on defect  rich and heterogeneous zno surfaces .    the initial growth of vapor  deposited copper on different zno surfaces at ultra ",

    "initially , the deposited cu atoms form two  dimensional islands ( i.e. clusters with a thickness of one atom ) until a critical coverage is reached , at which further cu atoms begin to add on top of the islands to form three  dimensional clusters , whereas the metal  free regions between the clusters fill only very slowly.@xcite this behavior was attributed to _ purely kinetic _ limitations at low temperatures since a thickening of the islands was observed upon annealing the surfaces .",
    "the critical coverages at which three  dimensional growth of the clusters begins , depends slightly on temperature and was estimated to be about 1/2 monolayer for the o  terminated ( 000@xmath3)o surface@xcite and 1/3 of a monolayer for the zn  terminated ( 0001)zn polar face of zno.@xcite in contrast , for clean , adsorbate ",
    "free nonpolar ( 10@xmath30 ) surfaces exclusively three  dimensional islands were observed at all coverages.@xcite    the main focus of theoretical investigations of the bonding of metal films and clusters on oxide surfaces has been on the mgo ( 001 ) surface@xcite and to a lesser extent on the surfaces of more complex oxides such as tio@xmath0,@xcite al@xmath0o@xmath1,@xcite and mgal@xmath0o@xmath4.@xcite almost all studies were restricted to nonpolar surface terminations .",
    "polar surfaces , on the other hand , like the two basal planes of zno , may show a completely different behavior compared to nonpolar surfaces .",
    "the reason is that polar surfaces are characterized by an excess of one atomic species@xcite which leads to an interesting interplay between their electronic and atomic structure : in order to be charge ",
    "neutral the polar surfaces either have to adopt an electronic structure with partially occupied surface bands ( sometimes referred to as `` metallization '' of polar surfaces ) , or they have to reconstruct ( preferentially by the loss of suitable surface atoms ) in order to avoid partial band filling , or charged species have to be adsorbed.@xcite depending on which mechanism is realized in a particular system , very different properties of the interaction with metal films and coadsorbates may occur .",

    " functional results .    in the present study",
    "we have calculated the adhesion energy and geometry of single cu atoms and copper monolayers at various coverages on the two polar surface terminations of zno .",
    "the surfaces are described by periodically repeated slabs so that the different stabilization mechanisms for the polar surfaces , in particular the existence of partially occupied surface bands , can be handled without any restrictions .",
    "additionally , atomic relaxations are fully taken into account .",
    "the main focus of this study will be on how the charge neutralization process of the polar surfaces and the filling of the surface bands influences the adsorption properties of copper spanning the range from single atoms to full monolayers .",
    "in addition to the very recent quantum  chemical finite cluster study , ref .  , these are the first ab  initio results for the adhesion energies and geometries of copper on zno surfaces .",
    "self  consistent total  energy calculations based on density  functional theory ( dft)@xcite were carried out to determine the adsorption energies and geometries of cu atoms and monolayers on the polar zno surfaces .",
    "the exchange  correlation energy and potential were treated within the generalized  gradient approximation ( gga ) using the functional of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite normconserving pseudopotentials@xcite were employed together with a mixed  basis set consisting of plane waves and non  overlapping localized orbitals for the o@xmath5 , the zn@xmath6 and the cu@xmath6 electrons.@xcite a plane  wave cut  off energy of 20ry was sufficient to get well converged results .",
    "the polar surfaces are represented by periodically repeated slabs .",

    "o double - layers were used to reduce the residual internal electric field.@xcite .",
    "all atomic configurations were fully relaxed by minimizing the atomic forces .",
    "the calculations for single cu atoms were performed on ( 2@xmath72 ) surface unit cells ( corresponding to a cu surface coverage of 1/4 monolayer ) , and the slab thickness was reduced to 4 zno double - layers . in a ( 2@xmath72 ) surface unit cell arrangement",
    "the cu atoms are more than 6.5 apart .",
    "the interaction energy between the cu atoms is calculated to be less than 0.02ev so that this setup is sufficient to describe very well isolated cu atoms .",
    "three different high  symmetry adsorption sites are present at the polar zno surfaces ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : polar ] ) : an ` on - top ' position which would be the regular lattice site for the next atomic layer , a ` hcp - hollow site ' above atoms in the second surface layer and a ` fcc - hollow site ' with no atoms beneath .",
    "all three adsorption sites are considered in the present study .",
    "copper atoms are only adsorbed on one of the two slab terminations .",
    "the electrostatic potential is calculated as for a genuinely isolated slab@xcite so no artificial interactions between the periodically repeated images of the slabs is present .",

    "before we start our investigation of copper on the polar zno surfaces , we address the question how well our dft method and in particular the pbe functional are able to describe the interaction of cu and zno surfaces . for cu on mgo(001 ) significant differences between various wave  function based quantum  chemical methods and dft calculations using different gga functionals were observed.@xcite as a general trend it was found that dft slightly overestimates the adhesion energy of cu on mgo clusters compared to best coupled  cluster calculations , with noticeable variations between the gga functionals .    to test the reliability of our dft results we have calculated the binding energy and equilibrium distance of cu on a small , isolated zn@xmath4o@xmath4 cluster which we can compare with recently published results of an accurate coupled",
    " type calculation ( multi  configuration coupled electron  pair approximation mc ",
    "cepa).@xcite a wurtzite  like cluster geometry was chosen in order to mimic the stacking sequence of polar slabs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zn4o4 ] ) .",
    "the cu atom is adsorbed to the top o and bottom zn atom of the cluster which are three  fold coordinated like at a zno surface .",
    "the zn@xmath4o@xmath4 cluster itself is a closed  shell system , but with the additional cu atom it becomes open - shell .",
    "therefore , in the first calculation for a single cu atom on - top of the three ",
    "fold o atom of the cluster we used the spin  polarized version of the pbe functional to obtain the total energy of the adsorbate system as well as for the energy of the single cu reference atom . the binding energy and the equilibrium distance",
    "are given in table  [ tab : zn4o4 ] .",
    "no significant differences in the adsorption properties are found if the spin  polarization is completely neglected and both , the calculations for the adsorbate system and the separate zn@xmath4o@xmath4 cluster and the isolated cu atom are done with the nonpolarized pbe functional . also using a cu dimer instead of",
    "a single cu atom gave a very similar result .",
    "since the inclusion of spin polarization doubles the computational cost , we only used a cu dimer for the study of the interaction of cu with the three  fold coordinated zn atom of the finite cluster .    compared to mc ",
    "cepa results we find a satisfying agreement for the binding energies and equilibrium distances . like in the case of cu on mgo ,",
    "the dft calculation ( here with the pbe functional ) slightly overestimates the bond strength . however , the adsorption energy is ` equally ' to large by 0.15 to 0.25ev , so that the relative stability of the o and the zn adsorption site is quite well described .",
    "overall we find that cu preferentially binds to oxygen atoms with an adhesion energy of almost 1ev .",
    "the same behavior was also found for mgo@xcite , but with a lower binding energy of 0.4ev ( coupled  cluster ) and 0.6ev ( dft - gga ) .",

    "the mc  cepa values are taken from ref .  . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      several very recent studies have created considerable doubt that the polar zno surfaces really exist as ideal , truncated  bulk  like surfaces . with scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )",
    "nanoscaled island and pit structures were found at the zn  terminated face@xcite which lead to an overall loss of roughly 1/4 of the surface zn atoms .",
    "such a stabilization mechanism was confirmed in dft calculations@xcite which furthermore predict high concentrations of adsorbed oh  groups in hydrogen ",
    "rich environments . for the o  terminated surface it was shown by he atom scattering,@xcite in a study of the co adsorption energetics,@xcite and also by dft calculations @xcite that they are h covered for a wide range of temperatures and h partial pressures . both mechanisms , loss of zn atoms and adsorption of hydrogen , lead to a filling of the surface bands .",
    "the filling need not to be perfect , however , in order to study the consequences of such a stabilization of the polar surfaces on the cu ( co)adsorption properties and also in order to support our prediction from the last subsection , we have considered two idealized surface structures of the polar zno surfaces for which the surface bands are fully occupied .    for the o and the zn  terminated surface",

    "[ sec : metallic ] .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : insulating ] .",
    "we find indeed that the cu binding energy is significantly reduced compared to the result of the ideal surface termination with partially occupied ( `` metallized '' ) surface bands .",
    "the adsorption energy of roughly 1ev of cu atoms on the h covered o  terminated surface is only slightly larger than what was found for the finite closed - shell zn@xmath4o@xmath4 cluster and for the nonpolar zno surface ( having fully occupied bands , i.e. nonmetallic character).@xcite in addition , a similarly small value was also found in a quantum  chemical embedded cluster study of the polar o  terminated surface@xcite in which the embedding scheme was chosen in such a way that it leads to fully occupied surface bands , similar to our hydrogen covered surface .",

    "zno and bulk cu have very different lattice constants .",
    "the equilibrium distance of the surface atoms at the polar surfaces is computed to be 3.28 ( experimentally : 3.25 ) , and for the cu bulk lattice constant we found 3.65 which corresponds to a nearest  neighbor separation between the cu atoms of 2.58 ( experimentally : 3.615 and 2.56 , respectively ) .",
    "epitaxial growth with a ( 111 ) orientation of copper would therefore lead to a lattice mismatch of 21% .",
    "thus , we can not expext that expitaxial growth occurs .",
    "experimentally it was found that cu on the polar surfaces is basically unstrained , even at very low coverages.@xcite exclusively ( 111 ) cu planes were observed with a fixed orientation given by the zno substrate .    the realistic treatment of such unstrained copper layers on the zno surfaces would be computationally very demanding since we would have to use prohibitively large surface unit cells for our slab .",
    "however , in order to get a first idea on how the cu adsorption strength and the preferred adsorption sites change if a high concentration of copper is present on the polar surfaces we have nevertheless studied ideal expitaxial cu ( 111 ) monolayers on the zno surfaces . for such hypothetical films we have calculated the equilibrium distance and the work of separation which is defined as the energy difference between the adsorbed monolayer and separate zno slabs and metal films .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : mono ] .",
    "for the o  terminated surface we find that cu preferentially binds on - top of the oxygen atoms .",
    "the equilibrium distance and the binding energy of 1.23ev per cu atom are very similar to the results obtained for single atoms on the finite zn@xmath4o@xmath4 cluster and the surface with filled surface states . also for the zn  terminated surface",
    "we find a good binding of the copper monolayers with a work of separation of almost 0.9ev per cu atom .",
    "this is in agreement with experiment where a good adhesion of cu on both polar surface terminations was found.@xcite in contrast to the o  terminated surface , the hollow positions for the cu atoms are more stable than the on - top site .",
    "the two hollow positions are very similar in energy and may both be populated for non  epitaxial films .",
    "this may explain the experimental observation that the orientation of deposited cu relative to the substrate is less strict for the zn  terminated face than for the o ",

    "the relaxation energy contributes 20% to 30% to the binding energy of these copper films .",

    "this will give some insight into the nature of the chemical bond at the interface .",
    "the higher coverages were simulated by adding a second and a third monolayer of cu on - top of the polar surface .",
    "for the two and three layer films different stacking sequences are possible .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : double ] and table  [ tab : triple ] , the energy differences between different stacking sequences turn out to be very small so that the specific stacking does not play a role in the following arguments .",
    "overall we find that the same adsorption sites as for the monolayer coverage are the most stable ones for the thicker cu films : the on - top position for the o  terminated surface and the hollow - sites for the zn  terminated face .",
    "for the o  terminated surface the work of separation increases with the thickness of the copper film , whereas for the zn  termination a small decrease in the binding energy is observed .",
    "this behavior as well as the preferred adsorption sites can be explained as follow : for the o  terminated surface the first copper layer adopts the role of the missing next zn layer .",
    "therefore the on - top position , which is the next regular lattice site of the wurtzite structure , is preferred .",
    "charge is donated to the surface o ions to fill the partially occupied surface bands , which can more easily occur for thicker copper films , and a partially ionic / covalent bond like in bulk zno is formed .    on the other hand , for the zn  terminated surface , the topmost zn layer behaves more like the first layer of the adsorbed metal film .",
    "therefore the hollow positions , which correspond to an extension of the metal film , are the low - energy adsorption sites .",
    "the @xmath11 electrons of the partially filled zn surface band contribute to the metallic state of the metal film so that the zn  cu bond is more metallic in character .",

    "using dft calculations and periodically repeated slabs to represent the two polar zno surfaces , i.e. the ( 000@xmath3)o and ( 0001)zn faces , we find a pronounced difference in the adsorption energy of cu atoms depending on the coverage . crucial to the proposed understanding of this phenomenon is the fact that the ideal , unreconstructed o and zn  terminated surfaces feature partially filled surface states with a 3/4 and a 1/4 filled band , respectively ( often referred to as `` metallization '' of the polar surfaces ) . up to 1/2 monolayer coverage",
    "the adhesion of copper on such polar surfaces is found to be very strong since the @xmath11 electrons of the cu atoms can fill these partially occupied bands and thereby stabilize the polar surface itself . however ,",
    "as soon as these bands are filled due to copper ( or due to coadsorbates ! ) already present on the surface , the binding of additional cu to the surface becomes weaker and less favorable in comparison to the cohesion energy of cu in small cu clusters and thin cu films .",
    "considering the experimentally known coverage ",
    "dependent change of the growth mode of copper on the polar zno surfaces ( i.e. formation of two  dimensional islands until critical coverages of about 50% and 30% for the o and the zn  terminated surface , respectively , is reached at which three  dimensional growth of cu clusters sets in ) it may very well be that this sudden change is not caused by _",
    "kinetic _ limitations at low temperatures alone . instead",
    ", it might also be driven _ thermodynamically _ by the significant change in the adsorption energetics of copper on such polar surfaces due to successive band filling , which in turn is directly coupled to increasing the surface coverage . the lower critical coverage found experimentally for the zn  terminated surface",
    "may then be explained quite naturally by the lower adsorption energy of copper found for this particular surface .",
    "additionally , the presence of coadsorbates during or prior to copper deposition may strongly influence both the critical coverage and the morphology of the grown cu particles .",
    "thus , it becomes evident that the _ polar _ zno surfaces allow for a wealth of quite different adsorption scenarios depending on parameters such as coverage , defects , coadsorbates etc .",
    "since these parameters typically change in complex ways during catalytic cycles one is tempted to speculate that the polar character might be at the very heart of the catalytic activity of zno .",
