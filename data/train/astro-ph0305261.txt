    "the ultimate observational evidence of a celestial body being a black hole comes from dynamical studies , by measuring the gravitational influence of the central object on neighboring stars and gas , both in binary systems and in the nuclei of galaxies . however , there are a number of distinctive signatures of black hole - powered activity that are usually regarded as proxy of black hole existence .",
    "relativistic jets emitting synchrotron radiation in the radio band are one such signature , the second most common being the presence of strong , compact power - law x - ray emission commonly associated with the inner part of an accretion flow .",
    "indeed , as a general property , accretion onto compact objects and the launch of relativistic outflows / jets seem to be correlated ( or _ symbiotic _ , falcke & biermann , 1995 ) phenomena @xcite .",
    "this implies that , at some level , a correlation between jet and disc flux is unavoidable .",
    "observationally , jet morphologies and spectral properties of both radio and x - ray cores are remarkably similar in the case of black holes of stellar mass ( galactic black holes , hereafter gbh ) and of their supermassive counterparts in the nuclei of galaxies ( hereafter smbh ) .",
    "if jets are launched in the innermost parts of the accretion flows , as commonly assumed , then these similarities suggest that it should be possible to understand the physics of both black hole accretion and jet production by studying all those systems as a _",
    "single _ class . to this end ,",
    "radiation emerging at radio and ( hard ) x - ray frequencies is the most direct probe of the immediate vicinity of the black hole : effects of extinction are unimportant in the radio band , while in the x - rays , where a large fraction of the accretion energy is radiated , such effects can be accounted for with good enough spectral capabilities .",
    "thus , radio and x - ray observations , together with the information on the central black hole mass , should allow us to study the relationship between the fundamental parameters characterizing black hole activity such as the central black hole mass , @xmath7 , and the accretion rate , @xmath8 , as well as the disc  jet coupling .",
    "until less than ten years ago , quasars and active galactic nuclei , and the supermassive black holes believed to power them , were regarded as exceptional ( and extreme ) objects . however , beginning with the work of kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) and , in particular , magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the idea that smbh reside in the nuclei of virtually every galaxy in the nearby universe has become almost commonplace .",
    "a sharp picture of the demographics of local smbh comes from the work of ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1997b ) , who have carried out a detailed optical spectroscopic survey of a large number of nearby galaxies . from this work",
    ", it was found that between a third and a half of the sample has agn - like spectra , albeit of low luminosity , ( llagn ; either of the liner , seyfert or transition type ; see ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a ) , thus confirming that smbh are not only present in galaxies , but that they are also active ( at least as some level ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "follow - up radio surveys of optically selected llagn @xcite have yielded extremely high detection rates , with the radio emission having predominantly a compact core morphology , occasionally accompanied by jet - like features .",
    "x - ray studies at arcsecond ( or sub - arcsecond ) resolution with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory have also allowed us to firmly pin down the emission properties of the nearby dim galactic nuclei through systematic surveys of llagn @xcite .",
    "these pieces of information on local , low - luminosity objects nicely complement those on more luminous ( and more distant ) `` classical '' agn ( i.e. seyfert galaxies , qsos , radio galaxies ) and allow us to investigate the dependences of observable properties on black hole mass and accretion rate .    as a matter of fact , alongside the work on black hole demographics ,",
    "there have been various claims for the existence of a correlation between radio luminosity or radio loudness ( a measure of the ratio of radio to bolometric luminosity ) and smbh masses @xcite .",
    "comparisons of radio emission from gbh and smbh has also led to the suggestion that there is a systematic difference in radio loudness between the two classes , smbh being on average more radio loud @xcite .",
    "furthermore , among x - ray binaries , black holes tend to be more radio loud than neutron stars @xcite , possibly also indicating a mass dependence of the radio loudness parameter",
    ". however , the difficulty of separating the dependence of the radio power output on the accretion rate ( due to the lack , or the neglect , of an independent observational indicator of it for smbh ) unavoidably makes the evidence of any such correlation rather weak .",
    "indeed , other authors , using different samples , have recently found no evidence for such correlations @xcite .    a link between the disc accretion rate and the generation of relativistic radio jets has been suggested by willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for radio galaxies and by ho & peng ( 2001 ) for seyfert 1 nuclei , on the basis of the strong observed correlations between radio and optical powers . moreover , by studying a sample of galactic nuclei with measured black hole masses , ho ( 2002 ) found clear evidence of radio loudness being anti - correlated with some estimator of the dimensionless accretion rate .",
    "interestingly , brinkmann et al . ( 2000 ) have also correlated the rosat all - sky survey and the vla first catalog , and have shown that there is some degree of correlation between the monochromatic x - ray luminosity at 2 kev and the radio ( 5 ghz ) luminosity for bright agn and quasars ( for both radio loud and radio quiet sources ) , while sambruna et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have found a weak correlation between lobe radio power and 2 - 10 kev luminosity in a sample of radio loud agn .",
    "the situation is rather different for gbh where the measured black hole masses span a very narrow range ( around 10 solar masses ) . in this case , the observed , rather large , changes in luminosity can only be explained if they are somehow linked to variations in the accretion rate . on this note ,",
    "recent work has shown that gbhs in the low / hard state ( where their spectra are dominated by a power - law x - ray emission with typical bolometric luminosities @xmath9 ) always possess compact radio cores @xcite the radio luminosity of which is tightly correlated with their x - ray luminosity over more than three orders of magnitude , with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the evidence of such a correlation emphasizes the effects of the dependence of the radio luminosity on the accretion rate and hence the connection between accretion and jet processes .",
    "however , an alternative model has been put forward recently , based on the broad band spectral energy distributions of some gbh in the low / hard state , in which the x - ray emission from those objects is produced by optically thin synchrotron radiation emerging from the jet itself @xcite .",
    "the tightness of the observed correlation between radio and x - ray luminosity , and its slope , seem to support such an idea @xcite .",
    "finally , we should also note that gbh with bolometric luminosity close to their eddington limit display a more complicated behavior when observed in the radio band .",
    "there is evidence that in the high / soft state ( when the spectral energy distribution is dominated by a quasi - thermal component with @xmath11 kev ) continuous jet production is inhibited , while at still higher luminosities ( in the so - called very high state ) powerful , episodic super - luminal ejection events have been observed ( in particular in the prototypical microquasar grs 1915 + 105 , mirabel & rodriguez , 1994 ) .",
    "thus , high luminosity black hole x - ray binaries seem to display a ( temporal ) dichotomy between radio loud and radio quiet states , reminiscent of that of powerful quasars .",
    "this rapid ( albeit somewhat disorderly ) progress in the observational studies of black holes of all classes seems to offer the possibility for understanding fundamental scalings of black hole properties with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "accretion disc theory can provide us with the relationships between the observed radiative output ( hence x - ray luminosity ) and the black hole masses and accretion rates .",
    "unfortunately , theoretical modeling of the relation between jet properties ( related to the observed radio luminosity ) and the physical parameters of the system ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) has been hampered by the lack of a clear understanding of the mechanism by which jets are accelerated and collimated .",
    "relating the x - ray and radio properties of a black hole system to only @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 has not been straightforward .",
    "however , in a recent paper , heinz & sunyaev ( 2003 ) have demonstrated that , under the general assumption that the jet formation process is not qualitatively different among smbh of different mass or between smbh and gbh , it is in fact possible to derive a universal scaling between the jet ( radio ) luminosity at a given frequency , @xmath12 , and both mass and accretion rate .",
    "the derived relation is _ independent of the jet model _ and has scaling indices that depend only on the ( observable ) spectral slope of the synchrotron emission in the radio band , and on the accretion model ( see   [ sec : physics ] below ) .    motivated by these findings , the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we want to examine ( or re - examine ) the significance of the correlations between radio and x - ray luminosities with @xmath7 and with each other in a large sample of black holes with measured masses that includes _ both _ gbh and smbh .",
    "this will be dealt with in the first part of the paper : in  [ sec : sam ] , we describe the selection criteria and the properties of our sample , while in  [ sec : corr ] and  [ sec : results ] we present the results of the correlation analysis and we describe the observational properties of the fundamental plane of black hole activity .",
    "then , in the second part of the paper (  [ sec : physics ] ) we will make use of the model by heinz & sunyaev ( 2003 ) to relate observed correlation coefficients that define the fundamental plane to theoretically predicted ones .",
    "this will allow us to place constraints on the physical properties of the accretion flow from which the jet is launched , and in particular on its radiative efficiency .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to a discussion of our findings and of their general implications for our understanding of black hole activity in different regimes .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we have selected from the existing literature a sample of black hole - powered systems with measured masses , the nuclei of which have been observed both at 5 ghz ( mostly with arcsecond resolution with the vla ) and in the 2 - 10 kev band . for future reference",
    "we define the dimensionless black hole mass @xmath13 and accretion rate @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the accretion efficiency .",
    "we first considered the full sample of @xmath16 nearby inactive , or weakly active galaxies with existing nuclear black hole mass measurements from observations of spatially resolved kinematics .",
    "to these we have added a comparable number of bright agns ( and qsos ) with nuclear black hole mass measured from reverberation mapping of their broad line region ( a similar sample was compiled by ho et al .",
    "2002 ) . from this sample we selected all objects which have been observed in both the radio and x - ray bands .    in order to obtain a more statistically representative sample",
    ", we also searched the existing literature for both nearby low - luminosity galactic nuclei ( ho et al .",
    ", 2001 ; terashima et al . , 2002 ; nagar et al . , 2002 ; terashima & wilson , 2003 ) and for relatively bright seyfert nuclei ( either type 1 , type 2 or narrow line seyfert 1 ) and radio galaxies with available radio and x - ray flux measurements .",
    "we assign black hole masses to these systems using the observed correlation between black hole masses and stellar velocity dispersion @xcite , , as derived in ferrarese ( 2002 ) .",
    "see however tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for a thorough statistical discussion of the different scalings that have been claimed for the @xmath17 relation . ] mostly using the values of the velocity dispersion provided by the hyperleda catalogue @xcite .",
    "we note here that it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the different methods ( and their qualities ) for estimating black hole masses in the nuclei of galaxies , and refer the reader to the comprehensive literature on the subject ( see e.g. de zeeuw , 2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "we do not include in our sample distant quasars , for which the @xmath18 relation can not be used because of the lack velocity dispersion measurements . in practice , we want to avoid any indirect method for black hole mass estimation that relies on e.g. the continuum optical / uv luminosity ( as done by woo & urry , 2002 , for example ) .",
    "relativistically beamed sources ( i.e. those whose jet axis points towards our line of sight ) are dominated by the boosted jet emission , and can not be used to test the disc - jet coupling .",
    "we therefore excluded from our sample bl lac objects . among the quasars in our sample ,",
    "only 3c 273 , which has an extremely high radio loudness and a blazar - like spectrum , is likely to suffer from strong doppler boosting of the radio jet . on the other hand , according to the unification scheme , seyfert 2 nuclei should not be preferentially viewed pole on .",
    "for all the other sources ( mainly low - luminosity agn and seyfert 1 ) , for which the nature of the ( relatively faint ) radio emission is not well established , we have assumed that the orientation of their jets with respect to line of sight is randomly distributed .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the possible incidence of relativistic beaming as a selection effect will be presented in  [ sec : beaming ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in the previous sections we have shown how different theoretical models for the emission processes responsible for the observed radio and x - ray emission from black holes can be directly translated into predictions for the observable correlation coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : lr ] ) .",
    "the relatively tight observational constraints on these indices that we have derived in section  [ sec : corr ] can therefore be used to directly test these models .",
    "the theoretical coefficients for different models are shown in figure  [ fig : nukerstats1 ] .",
    "the circles and the squares denote inefficient and efficient disc accretion respectively .",
    "diamonds represent synchrotron x - rays from the jet .",
    "open and closed symbols are for flat ( @xmath21 ) and steep ( @xmath22 ) spectrum sources , respectively .",
    "all model coefficients are calculated assuming @xmath23 ( but see  [ sec : jet_xrays ] for a discussion of steeper electron distributions as due , for example , to the effects of cooling ) . to highlight the sensitivity of the coefficients to variations in @xmath24",
    ", we also plotted the tracks in @xmath25 space for changes in @xmath24 between 0 and 0.5 .",
    "for the models in which x - rays are produced by radiatively inefficient accretion , we have @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see  [ sec : adaf ] ) .",
    "the predicted coefficients for both flat and steep spectrum sources lie roughly within the @xmath28 contours of the observed sample .",
    "thus , radiatively inefficient accretion is consistent with the observations .",
    "this conclusion is also true for the general class of models for which @xmath29 .    for the standard disc ",
    "corona model , we have @xmath30 ( high radiative efficiency ) and @xmath31 ( see  [ sec : corona ] ) .",
    "the model predictions fall well outside the @xmath28 contours of the data and are therefore inconsistent with the observations .    for the models in which the x - rays are produced by optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet itself , the flat spectrum model predictions are marginally consistent with the data ( the model point is close to the @xmath28 contour ) , while the steep spectrum model point lies well outside the @xmath28 contour .",
    "these results suggest that , in a statistical sense , the correlations between radio luminosity , x - ray luminosity and mass of active black holes require a radiatively inefficient accretion flow coupled with a ( scale invariant ) synchrotron emitting jet . it is important to stress here that this result does not suggest that the adaf model for the accretion flow is the correct one , and convection and/or powerful outflows are unimportant .",
    "in fact , the nature of the radio emission and the mere existence of the fundamental plane are clear indications that the full dynamical model for the accretion flow should at some level include , in a self - consistent manner , the effects of the backreaction from the outflowing gas .",
    "however , our results rather dictates that the radiative efficiency of the flow _ must _ be low .",
    "this conclusion holds over the observed range of @xmath32 , and therefore for sources which are substantially sub - eddington . in ",
    "[ sec : accretionmodechanges ] we discuss what should be expected from similar studies performed on samples that include a larger number of very luminous black holes .    the jet synchrotron model for the x - ray emission with @xmath23 is only marginally consistent with the data .",
    "however , steeper electron distributions ( @xmath33 , for example ) do predict values for the correlation coefficient that are well within our 3-@xmath34 contours .",
    "an assessment of the relevance of such models should be made taking in due account the effect of cooling , as we discuss in  [ sec : jet_xrays ] .",
    "the main result of our work is the discovery of a `` fundamental plane '' of black hole activity .",
    "that is , if we define the instantaneous state of activity of a black hole of mass @xmath3 ( in units of solar masses ) , by the radio luminosity at a fixed frequency ( for example at 5 ghz ) , and by the hard x - ray luminosity ( for example in the 2 - 10 kev energy band ) of its compact core , and represent such an object as a point in the three - dimensional space ( @xmath4 ) , all the points representing black holes ( either of stellar mass or supermassive ) will lie preferentially on a plane , described by equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) .",
    "we note that in the case the radiatively inefficient disc model ( @xmath26 ) the fundamental plane equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) implies that the radio luminosity satisfies : @xmath35 i.e. , @xmath1 scales with the _ physical accretion rate _ only .",
    "this is very close to the predicted dependence of @xmath36 from [ sec : sync ] for the canonical parameter choice of @xmath37 , @xmath23 , and @xmath38 , for which the kinetic jet power @xmath39 is directly proportional to the physical accretion rate , @xmath40 ( see also falcke & biermann 1995 ) .",
    "then , the total power released by the accretion / jet system may be written as @xmath41 , where the first term on the right hand side is the total radiated luminosity and the last one include contributions from the energy advected and/or stored in the convective motions .",
    "our results suggest that the flow must be radiatively inefficient , therefore , for small enough accretion rates we have @xmath42 . on the other hand , @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the issue of what the relative fraction of the total accretion energy dissipated into the jet is ( or , alternatively , of when a source is `` jet dominated '' ; fender , gallo & jonker 2003 ; falcke , krding & markoff 2003 ) reduces to the determination of the value of the constant @xmath44 .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the structure functions @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc_inv ] ) , i.e. the specification of a jet model or the direct measure of the total kinetic power carried by the jet , together with a dynamical model for the disc - jet coupling , which is clearly beyond the scope of this paper .      the fundamental plane defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp ] ) is not , however , razor thin .",
    "the sources are substantially scattered around it , with a dispersion @xmath46 in @xmath47 ( corresponding to a dispersion of @xmath48 perpendicular to the plane ) .",
    "such a scatter is not at all surprising .",
    "theoretically , it can be explained in large part by the scatter in the radio spectral index @xmath24 .",
    "for example , if we consider the adaf ( @xmath26 ) model with fixed @xmath23 , we expect the theoretical relationship @xmath49 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us assume now that the unknown radio spectral index of all the observed sources is normally distributed , with @xmath50 . in order to fit the observed data ,",
    "we need @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the dispersion in the radio luminosity due to the dispersion in the unknown parameter @xmath24 is then @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the range in @xmath3 and @xmath55 the range in luminosity spanned by our sample .",
    "thus , a dispersion in the unknown radio spectral index of @xmath56 ( consistent with the observations ) , can give a large contribution to the observed intrinsic scatter .",
    "in addition to the scatter produced by the diversity in @xmath57 ( which introduces scatter in the fundamental plane relation simply by the fact the _ orientation _ of the plane is sliiightly different for different @xmath24 ) the _ intercept _ @xmath58 of the plane also varies as we look at different jet models and different spectral indices .",
    "it is not clear a - priori how much it does so , as this depends on how the shape functions @xmath59 ( see section  [ sec : sync ] ) vary in order to produce the different @xmath24 .",
    "while for one spectral class with uniform @xmath24 the normalization cancels out when determining the correlation coefficients , this is not true when comparing jets from different spectral classes , i.e. , with varying @xmath24 .",
    "the fact that the scatter in the relation is moderate indicates , however , that the change in @xmath59 over the range of radio spectral slopes that enter our sample is also moderate .",
    "ideally , we should therefore restrict the above analysis to sub - classes of sources which follow a very narrow range in @xmath24 .",
    "however , at the current stage the data do not allow such a division , both because the sample is too small and because the spectral indices are often not known to an accuracy that would allow such a treatment .",
    "the rough division of our sample into flat and steep spectrum sources nonetheless shows that such a treatment is possible and does lead to a reduction in scatter in the well defined and well sampled class of flat spectrum sources , for which we can be confident that the radio emission does indeed originate in the self - absorbed core of the jet ( a prerequisite of the scale invariance model by heinz & sunyaev , 2003 )",
    ".    a major source of scatter could be relativistic beaming , that we discuss in the following section .",
    "also to be taken into account is the influence of the black hole spin on jet formation @xcite .",
    "while we still expect the accretion disc to have significant influence on the jet power , as the magnetic field necessary to tap the black hole rotational energy must be provided and/or confined by the accretion disc ( thus setting the field strength and the jet power ; see livio , ogilvie & pringle 1999 ; meier 2001 ) , the spin itself will enter as a sensitive parameter into the radio luminosity as well , introducing scatter in any correlation . once again , strong future constraints on the tightness of this relation may help constrain the possible influence of black hole spin ( see e.g. fender 2003 , for a discussion of the gbh case ) .      because the jets that dominate radio emission from active black holes are known to be relativistic , doppler boosting of synchrotron radiation ( relativistic beaming ) must be taken into account when studying these sources .    for the purpose of our study it is of primary importance to avoid",
    "strongly beamed sources , whose intrinsic ( unbeamed ) radio luminosity can be difficult to infer .",
    "this is the reason why bl lac object have been excluded from our study .",
    "furthermore , it is also important to take into account possible strong selection effects due to relativistic beaming , that would skew the observed correlations . then , in a sample of randomly oriented jetted sources ( but without the aligned ones ) , relativistic beaming should be an additional source of scatter in any correlation involving radio luminosities , the magnitude of which depends on the average relativistic speed of the jets .    for the smbh in our sample ,",
    "the first selection criterion is the availability of a mass measurement of the central black hole .",
    "thus , the main selection biases do not come from flux limits , and no preferential selection of bright ( beamed ) sources should be operating , although anti - selection effect might be present .",
    "possible contaminations from beamed sources , however , could still be present among flat spectrum nearby llagn or type 1 seyfert ( we have 27 of them in the sample ) , given the current uncertainties on the exact nature of their radio emission .",
    "nevertheless , there are many reasons to believe that these sources are not biased towards jet axes close to the line of sight .",
    "flat spectrum llagn were originally selected in the optical band , from the palomar spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "many of those type 1 low - luminosity seyfert and liners do indeed possess double - peaked broad emission lines @xcite , clearly indicating a non negligible inclination angle .",
    "the radio properties of a number of these sources were also studied by nagar et al .",
    "they found that llagn lie on the extrapolation of the fr i / fr ii correlations in the @xmath60 plane , while a substantial offset would be expected if they were all strongly affected by beaming .",
    "once again , we are led to the conclusion that nearby llagn and seyfert 1 included in our sample have a random orientation angle , that should disfavor strongly beamed sources .",
    "finally we note that even if a few of these source were indeed strongly doppler boosted , their small number will not affect significantly the measured value of a correlation coefficient calculated in logarithmic space ( logarithmic weighting ) .",
    "selection effects due to beaming in galactic sources may be more subtle .",
    "due to the overall scaling of radio luminosity with mass , gbh are expected to be on average more radio quiet than smbh ( see also  [ sec : accretionmodechanges ] ) .",
    "it is indeed well known that galactic x - ray binaries are difficult to detect in the radio band , and this might already determine a selection bias towards beamed sources . in particular , sources selected from gbi monitoring ( see  [ sec : sam_gbh ] ) might be more beamed .",
    "if indeed gbh were all affected by strong selection biases toward beamed emission , the derived correlation coefficients of the fundamental plane , @xmath20 in particular , might be incorrect .",
    "however , we know from observation of proper motion during radio outbursts that the jets of the classical microquasars gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 have large angle with the line of sight ( see e.g. fender 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , for all the other gbh in our sample , apart from ls5039 , orbital parameters have been inferred from optical spectroscopy , and in none of them the inferred inclination angle appears to be small . therefore ,",
    "unless the black hole jets are all misaligned with the orbital angular momentum @xcite , we can exclude that strong beaming affects our sample .",
    "a similar conclusion had already been reached by an accurate study of the observed scatter ( @xmath61 ) about the @xmath62 correlation in a larger sample of low / hard state gbh @xcite .",
    "an analogous argument could be put forward for our entire sample , with the similar conclusion ( given the similar amount of scatter found here ) that the maximum doppler factor should not be too large .",
    "this conclusion would be further strengthen by noting that the observed scatter about the fundamental plane is not much larger than what expected from the intrinsic scatter in the radio spectral index @xmath24 ( see  [ sec : scatter ] ) .",
    "however , precise constraints on the doppler factor could only be obtained by analyzing more carefully selected samples with well determined ( possibly fixed ) radio spectral indices .      for the steep spectrum sources in our sample ,",
    "the origin of the radio emission is not entirely clear .",
    "steep spectra in general imply optically thin emission .",
    "this could be an indication that the emission is dominated by regions far away from the central engine , e.g. in the diffuse extended radio lobes or hot spots .",
    "this would prohibit any treatment that makes use of the scale invariant model , though scaling arguments for the large scale emission still apply @xcite .",
    "steep spectrum sources should then be excluded from the sample completely , and the fact that they still fit into the plane would then mostly be due to selection effects . it should be noted that in this case the radio luminosity should strongly correlate with the black hole mass ( which determines the kinetic jet power @xmath39 and thus the large scale radio luminosity ) , while it should not be related to the instantaneous x - ray flux , because the radio lobes reflect the mean power output by the central source , averaging out its temporal variability .",
    "we expect this to be a problem for galactic black hole sources , where we have lower resolving power . for supermassive black holes and for nearby llagn in particular",
    ", we can be more confident that the large scale emission is well resolved and thus does not contribute to the core emission used in our sample .",
    "it is also possible that some of the steep spectrum sources can be associated to core jet emission which is optically thin at radio frequencies , i.e. , their self - absorption break lies below 5 ghz . because we would expect the self - absorption break frequency to be lower for higher @xmath3 and lower accretion rates @xmath63 @xcite",
    ", this effect would imply that steep spectra should predominantly be observed in smbh which are relatively x - ray dim . while the trend with @xmath2 is not clear in the data , the fact that the steep spectrum sources in our sample almost exclusively belong to the smbh class does suggest that at least some of the sources in the sample might indeed be core dominated steep spectrum sources , for which the theoretical analysis of  [ sec : physics ] holds .      our analysis , taken at face value , does suggest that accretion models for the origin of the x - ray emission fit the data somewhat better than pure jet models . however , at x - ray energies the effects of cooling on the particle spectrum can not be ignored . in the context of scale invariant models , taking cooling into account is not possible .",
    "proper treatment of particle transport including the effects of cooling may lead to different results for the synchrotron x - ray model .",
    "in fact , simply using @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tildexi ] ) ( as expected in a continuous particle injection model with cooling ) moves the flat spectrum point close to the @xmath64 contour of the observed correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig : nukerstats1 ] .    for the case of the galactic black hole gx 339 - 4 in the hard state , where the radio  x - rays correlation is well established , markoff et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were able to fit the observed slope ( @xmath65 ) with a synchrotron x - ray model assuming @xmath66 ( and thus @xmath67 , which is also close to the average slope of the x - ray spectral index of the source in the hard state ) .",
    "here we have found that , in a statistical sense , higher values of @xmath68 are needed to explain the observed correlation for the entire sample in the framework of the jet synchrotron model for the x - ray emission .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath23 the x - ray synchrotron luminosity from the jet scales like @xmath69 , while the disc x - ray luminosity follows @xmath70 .",
    "thus , _ if _ the x - ray emission in gbh jets like gx 339 - 4 were indeed due to synchrotron emission , we would expect an even stronger contribution from synchrotron x - rays relative to the disc emission in agns with the same accretion rate , where the general wisdom ( mainly based on accurate analysis of detailed x - ray spectra ) is still that the x - rays originate predominantly in the disc . for @xmath33 , on the other hand , the synchrotron x - rays follow @xmath71 , and the relative contribution from jet and disc will be independent of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , the x - ray spectral variability behaviour of both gbh and seyfert galaxies is consistent with pivoting of the spectrum at x - ray energies .",
    "if the x - ray emission is produced by synchrotron radiation and there is no cooling break at longer wavelengths , such a power - law variability would imply a radio variability which is orders of magnitude larger than observed ( see discussion in zdziarski et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it seems , therefore , that _ if _ the x - ray emission in some of the sources is dominated by synchrotron emission from the jet , the effects of cooling must play an important role in determining the observed correlation . in the context of the scale - invariant model ,",
    "it is rather problematic to take cooling into account ; this is why a theoretical assessment of the role of the cooling on the observed correlation is beyond the scope of this paper .      due to the intrinsic scatter ,",
    "the predictive power of the @xmath72 relation is currently limited in scope . nonetheless , from the fundamental plane equation ( [ eq : fp ] )",
    ", we can derive a formal relationship between the observed fluxes in the radio ( at 5 ghz ) and in the x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) band ( in erg s@xmath73 @xmath74 ) , the distance to a source @xmath75 ( in mpc ) and its unknown mass .",
    "we obtain @xmath76    in particular , we can predict in which region of @xmath77 space we would expect to find intermediate mass black holes , if they exist , and specifically , where we would expect ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulx ; makishima et al . 2000 ) based on their x - ray flux , should they be intermediate mass black holes , as opposed to intrinsically beamed low mass black holes .",
    "a clear prediction of the fundamental plane equation in this sense is that , if ulx are stellar mass objects ( with @xmath78 ) , and their radio emission is not strongly doppler boosted , there is an upper limit to their radio flux at 5 ghz .",
    "for example , a ulx with and x - ray luminosity ( in the 2 - 10 kev band ) of 10@xmath79 ergs s@xmath73 at a distance of 10 mpc will have @xmath80 so its flux will be at most few microjansky .",
    "as an example , we refer to the recent claim of the observation of synchrotron radio emission from the ulx 2e 1400.2 - 4108 , in the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 5408 ( at a distance of @xmath81 mpc ) @xcite . the observed radio ( 0.26 mjy at 4.8 ghz ) and x - ray fluxes ( @xmath82 erg s@xmath73 @xmath74 in the 0.3 - 8 kev band ) ,",
    "if indeed both associated with a compact source at the distance of ngc 5408 , would imply a mass of @xmath83 .",
    "however , we should stress here that such an estimate only holds _ if the radio emission is not beamed_. the uncomfortably high value for the estimated mass , the steep inferred radio spectral index and the radio to x - ray flux ratio , all suggest that the observed intensity of the radio emission in this source may be doppler boosted by a relativistic jet pointing in our direction as already suggested by kaaret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "it is well accepted , both from theory and observations , that accretion can proceed in different modes ( or states ) , with different radiative efficiencies and spectral properties @xcite , mainly driven by variations of the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath84 .",
    "here we have demonstrated (  [ sec : physics ] ) that the correlation between radio and x - ray luminosity in gbhs and smbhs can provide valuable constraints on the emission mechanisms in these bands and on the physics of accretion .",
    "we have shown how low radiative efficiency accretion models can possibly provide the underlying scalings that most easily explain the properties of the observed fundamental plane .",
    "radiatively efficient thin disc  corona systems are clearly inconsistent with the data .",
    "the only possibility for these models to be reconciled with our observations would entail a highly radiatively inefficient corona , where most of the dissipated magnetic energy is converted into bulk kinetic energy of outflowing gas @xcite , as described by merloni & fabian ( 2002 ) .",
    "this would require some specific model for the magnetic dissipation processes , and for their scaling with @xmath3 and @xmath85 , which are currently unknown .",
    "however , because both such modes of accretion are expected to occur only below accretion rates @xmath86 few percent of eddington , we would expect the @xmath87 correlation to break down at around this limit .",
    "in other words , we should expect the qsos and the bright seyferts in our sample , which occupy the region of high accretion rates and are independently known to have spectral characteristics inconsistent with models of low radiative efficiency , to depart from the observed correlations .",
    "also in gbhs , it has indeed been shown that the correlation between radio and x - ray luminosity breaks down as the sources switch to their high states @xcite .",
    "in particular , high luminosity states of gbh ( high or very high states ) show highly variable radio fluxes and radio to x - ray ratios @xcite .",
    "if this reflects a general property of the disc  jet coupling at high accretion rates , a substantial increase in the scatter should appear above the critical accretion rate .    in order to illustrate this point further , in figure  [ fig : mdotcr ] we plot , as a function of the ratio @xmath32 , the radio luminosity divided by @xmath88 ( such a scaling for the radio luminosity with mass is obtained directly from the fundamental plane equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) by imposing that the x - ray luminosity scales linearly with black hole mass ) .",
    "as indeed expected , by rescaling the radio luminosity in such a way all the different tracks corresponding to different mass bins in fig .",
    "[ fig : lr_lx_bin]b collapse into a single one ( with some residual scatter ) .",
    "the region between the two vertical lines corresponds to the expected values of @xmath32 above which a change of accretion mode , from radiatively inefficient to standard radiatively efficient is expected to occur .",
    "our smbh sample is still limited in order to test whether such a change is observed .",
    "in fact , we select out of our sample the majority of bright quasars , both radio quiet and radio loud , because of the lack of a reliable mass estimates for these sources . however , there is indeed a hint of an apparent increase in the scatter about the correlation , above the critical accretion rates , as seen in figure  [ fig : mdotcr ] .",
    "we may thus speculate that the famous ( and still much debated , see e.g. cirasuolo et al .",
    "2003 ) radio loud / radio quiet dichotomy of quasars will appear only at the highest values of @xmath85 , and be caused mainly by a switch of accretion mode analogous to the high / very high transition in gbh . at low accretion rates , black holes seem to follow the more regular behavior circumscribed by the fundamental plane of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp ] ) .",
    "such sources not only tend to be radio loud @xcite , but also their radio loudness parameter , @xmath89 ( here defined as the ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity ) , obeys the following scaling : @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the smallest the x - ray luminosity , the more radio loud these sources are @xcite . in this regime , no dichotomy has to be expected , as already suggested by nagar et al .",
    "we have shown how the coupling between accretion flows and jet emission in black holes can be understood by studying large samples of _ both _ galactic ( gbh ) and supermassive ( smbh ) black holes with measured mass , observed at both radio and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "we have compiled , from the existing literature , a sample of @xmath0100 supermassive black holes and @xmath050 different observations of galactic , stellar mass black holes .",
    "we required that the smbh have a reliable measure of the central black hole mass , either ( preferentially ) direct , via high resolution kinematics studies of surrounding stars and gas or reverberation mapping of the broad line region ( for luminous seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars ) , or , indirectly , thanks to the empirical correlation between black hole masses and central velocity dispersion .",
    "although such selection criteria introduce a number of biases in the final distribution of @xmath3 , which are difficult to control , our final sample spans a large enough range in both mass and accretion rate to unveil major trends in the physical properties of active black holes .",
    "this is a crucial point , and represents the main novelty of our approach .",
    "most previous studies on the subject have only considered correlations of jet ( radio ) luminosity with black hole mass or with luminosity in other wavewbands ( and hence with accretion rate ) separately .",
    "we have performed a partial correlation analysis on the sample , and concluded that the radio luminosity is strongly correlated with _ both _ black hole mass _ and _ x - ray luminosity , while in turn , the x - ray luminosity correlates with both mass and radio luminosity . in light of this , we have carried out a multivariate linear regression analysis and derived the best fit correlation coefficient between radio luminosity , x - ray luminosity and black hole mass .",
    "the data from the entire sample allow us to put tight constraints on the correlation coefficients .",
    "remarkably , we find that the sources lie preferentially on a plane ( `` the fundamental plane of black hole activity '' ) in the three dimensional @xmath91 space , described by the equation @xmath92 .",
    "the scatter around this plane is , however , significant ( @xmath93 ) .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", these results clearly suggest that the _ ansatz _ of scale invariance for the disc ",
    "jet coupling @xcite captures the main physical properties of such systems .",
    "thus , a universal theoretical scaling between the radio flux at a given frequency and both mass and accretion rate can be derived , _ independently of the jet model _ , with scaling indices that depend only on the ( observable ) spectral slope of the synchrotron emission in the radio band , and on the accretion mode .",
    "also , it is possible to predict the correct amount of scatter for any such relationship .    by comparing the observationally derived correlation coefficients to the theoretically predicted ones , we are able to put constraints on accretion models and on the disc  jet coupling . we demonstrate that the x - ray emission from black holes accreting at less than a few per cent of the eddington rate can not be produced by radiatively efficient accretion , while radiatively inefficient accretion flows agree well with the data .",
    "the optically thin x - ray jet synchrotron emission model is only marginally consistent with the observed correlation ; however , cooling of the electrons should be properly taken into account before drawing a firmer conclusion on the issue .",
    "the fundamental plane equation also implies that low luminosity black holes should be more and more radio loud as the accretion rate decreases , as observed @xcite .",
    "the possible dichotomy between radio quiet and radio loud quasars could instead be due to a switch of accretion mode at the highest accretion rates .",
    "therefore , more accurately selected samples of more luminous sources , including a significant number of both radio quiet and loud quasars with well determined radio spectral properties , should allow the observation of bends , discontinuities or even bifurcations of the fundamental plane associated with accretion mode switches and with the turning on and off of the most powerful radio sources .",
    "after the submission of this manuscript another work has appeared as preprint @xcite , that is similar in scope , and reaches very similar conclusions about the scale invariant properties of low luminosity black holes .",
    "we are grateful to marat gilfanov for his useful comments .",
    "we thank eric feigelson and the statistical consulting center for astronomy ( sdass ) for providing the code for the partial correlation analysis and some advice on its usage .",
