    "these results indicate that the superconductivity coexists with a bulk ferromagnetic - like order in the sample .",
    "thus far , a growing body of evidence for the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been reported .",
    "the vast majority of these systems show superconductivity before the ferromagnetic ordering , and lead to the re - entrant superconductivity overlapped with a magnetic phase , such as errh@xmath7b@xmath7@xcite , erni@xmath0b@xmath0c@xcite , eufe@xmath0as@xmath4p@xmath5@xcite . in those systems , two separate sets of electrons may be responsible for magnetic ordering and superconductivity , respectively . while in our case , the ferromagnetic transition temperature is substantially higher than @xmath31 .",
    "the role of ce doping is twofold , they provide carriers to bis@xmath75 layers inducing superconductivity and they ferromagnetically order in the ( sr , ce)f sublattice . compared with the previous reports@xcite , the remarkable feature here",
    "is that the fm ordering can be established in the diluted ce lattice ( 50% ce in the srf layer ) mainly due to the rkky interaction .",
    "more experiments ( neutron and nmr ) and theoretical insight may provide useful clues for this issue in bis@xmath0-based superconductors .",
    "in summary , by partially substituting ce for sr in the newly discovered srfbis@xmath0 system , a ferromagnetic - like bulk ordered phase was put in evidence for temperatures below 7.5 k by transport , specific heat and dc - magnetization measurements .",
    "interestingly , this magnetic phase due to ce@xmath35 order coexists with superconductivity as temperature is lowered below @xmath3=2.8 k. in this system ce substitution likely provides carriers to the superconducting bis@xmath0 layers and , at the same time , it induces a fm ordering in the blocking ( sr , ce)f layers .",

    "<S> through the combination of x - ray diffraction , electrical transport , magnetic susceptibility , and the heat capacity measurements , we studied the effect of ce doping in the newly discovered srfbis@xmath0 system . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that sr@xmath1ce@xmath1fbis@xmath0 undergoes a second - order transition below @xmath27.5 k , followed by a superconducting transition with the critical temperature @xmath3@xmath22.8 k. our transport , specific heat and dc - magnetization results suggest the presence of bulk ferromagnetic correlation of ce ion below 7.5 k that coexist with superconductivity when the temperature is further lowered below 2.8 k. </S>"
