    "the temperature variation of relaxation times , viscosity and diffusion coefficient in glass forming liquids upon approaching the glass transition has been studied for a wide variety of substances . near the glass transition",
    ", these quantities show a rapid increase , but with a rate of change that is different for different substances .",
    "the rapidity of rise of relaxation times near the glass transition has been quantified by `` fragility '' , introduced and analyzed extensively by angell @xcite , which has proved to be useful in organizing and understanding the diversity of behavior seen in glass formers .",
    "fragility has been defined in a variety of ways .",
    "two of the popular definitions are in terms of the `` steepness index '' @xmath2 , and the fragility defined using vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) fits to viscosity and relaxation time data .",
    "the steepness index of fragility is defined from the so - called angell plot as the slope ( @xmath2 ) of logarithm of the viscosity ( @xmath3 ) or relaxation time ( @xmath4 ) at @xmath5 , with respect to the scaled inverse temperature @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the laboratory glass transition temperature :    @xmath8    we refer to the fragilities defined from transport quantities and relaxation times as _ kinetic _ fragilities , to be distinguished from _ thermodynamic _",
    "fragilities defined later . a kinetic fragility may also be defined from a vft fit of the relaxation times ,    @xmath9 \\label{eqn : kinfr2}\\ ] ]    which defines the kinetic fragility @xmath10 and the divergence temperature @xmath11 .    despite considerable research effort @xcite , and",
    "the observation of many empirical correlations between fragility and other material properties , a fully satisfactory understanding of fragility hasnt yet been reached .",
    "such understanding has been sought , broadly , along two lines .",
    "the first is a conceptual understanding of fundamental quantities that may govern fragility .",
    "an example of this kind is the use of the potential energy landscape approach in combination with adam gibbs ( ag ) relation @xcite between relaxation time and configuration entropy [ eq . [ eqn : ag ] ] to relate features of the energy landscape of a glass former to the fragility .",
    "the adam - gibbs relation @xmath12 relates the temperature dependence of the relaxation times to the temperature change in the configuration entropy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an activation free energy for particle rearrangements , and @xmath15 is the configurational entropy of cooperatively rearranging regions invoked in adam - gibbs theory .",
    "if @xmath16 has no significant role to play in determining the fragility of a substance , it is the temperature variation of @xmath17 that dictates the fragility . if the t - dependence of @xmath13 is given by @xmath18 the adam - gibbs relation yields the vft relation , with the identification @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is a thermodynamic index of fragility .",
    "in what follows , we use eq.s [ eqn : kinfr2 ] and [ eqn : ag ] which describe our simulation data well , as we demonstrate",
    ". however , our discussion does not depend crucially on the strict validity of the vft temperature dependence near the glass transition , or the divergence of relaxation times at finite temperature ; both these features have been questioned by various investigations and alternative forms to the vft temperature dependence have been proposed @xcite .    in potential energy landscape approach @xcite configuration entropy",
    "is associated with the number of local potential energy minima or _ inherent structures _ ( is ) @xcite , and can be computed in terms of parameters describing the energy landscape @xcite .",
    "hence thermodynamic fragility can be understood in terms of parameters of the potential energy landscape , namely the distribution of inherent structures and the dependence of the vibrational or basin entropy corresponding to inherent structures on theie energies .",
    "although the exact temperature dependence of the configuration entropy depends on detailed properties of the distribution of inherent structures , and @xmath21 is not a constant even in the simplest case , such analysis does yield insight into the relationship between the energy landscape features and fragility . to a first approximation , the broader the distribution of energies of inherent structures , the larger the fragility of a glass former @xcite .",
    "going beyond such analysis , one needs to also understand the behavior of the prefactor @xmath22 , which is related to the high temperature activation energy @xcite .",
    "to the extent that the adam - gibbs relation quantitatively describes the temperature dependence of the relaxation times , such analysis provides a route to a fundamental understanding of fragility in terms of the phase space properties of a substance .",
    "however , such a conceptual understanding does not directly address the dependence of fragility on specific , controllable material properties , an understanding that is desirable from the perspective , _",
    "e. g. _ , of materials design .",
    "the investigation of the dependence of fragility on the nature of molecular architecture and intermolecular interactions defines therefore a second distinct line of investigation , which has been pursued by various groups .",
    "for example , dudowicz , freed and douglas @xcite have investigated the role of backbone and side group stiffness in determining the fragility of polymer glass formers . in another recent example , from an experimental investigation on deformable colloidal suspensions , mattsson _ et al _ @xcite suggested that increasing the softness of the colloidal particles should decrease the fragility of the colloidal suspensions , and that such a principle should be more generally applicable .",
    "indeed , this conclusion is consistent with that of douglas and co - workers @xcite that the ability to better pack molecules leads to lower fragilities . in energy landscape terms , one may understand this conclusion as implying that molecules that pack well together will have narrower distributions of inherent structure energies .",
    "without truncation for the three different potentials used in the present study .",
    "@xmath23 are the positions of the minima of the interaction potentials.,width=226,height=188 ]     with truncation for the three different potentials .",
    "@xmath23 are the positions of the minima of the interaction potentials . , width=226,height=188 ]    the influence of the softness of interaction on the fragility was also investigated some time ago _ via _ computer simulations of model glass formers by bordat _",
    "they considered a binary mixture of particles interacting _ via _ generalized lennard jones potentials , of the form @xmath24 for combinations of the exponents @xmath25 of repulsive and attractive parts of the potential ( 12,11 ) , ( 12,6 ) and ( 8,5 ) .",
    "these combinations , corresponding to models labeled i , ii and iii , have decreasing curvatures at the minimum of the potential , and thus increasing softness . by evaluating the _ kinetic _ fragility of these models",
    "( the steepness index defined above ) , bordat _ et al _ found that _ increasing _ softness of the interaction potential _",
    "increases _ the kinetic fragility @xcite .    the trend found by bordat _",
    "et al _ therefore is apparently not consistent with expectations arising from the other studies mentioned , although the nature of the changes in the interactions considered are not strictly the same . in order to understand better the relationship between the nature of the intermolecular interactions and fragility , in the present work we calculate the kinetic fragility @xmath10 using computer simulation data of the diffusion coefficient , and relaxation times obtained by a number of different means .",
    "we also calculate , using the procedure in @xcite , the configuration entropy , from which we calculate a thermodynamic fragility ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we find that these two fragilities show opposite trends , with the kinetic fragility increasing with softness , and the thermodynamic fragility decreasing with softness . in order to understand this apparent disagreement",
    ", we must consider the full form of the adam - gibbs relation , including terms that relate to the high temperature activation energy .",
    "we present our analysis along these lines below .",
    "we focus our analysis here on the role of a specific feature of the interaction potential , namely the softness , for reasons stated above . however , fragility in principle depends on a number of parameters that describe a glass former , which may include pressure , density _ etc._. while our study implicitly includes those factors that are affected by a change in the interaction potential ( keeping other parameters fixed ) , we do not attempt here a comprehensive analysis of all factors that may influence the fragility of a glass former .",
    "related questions concerning the change in structure , dynamics and thermodynamics in a glass forming liquid upon tuning the interaction potential have been addressed in @xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we summarize the computer simulation details . in section iii",

    "relaxation times obtained from the decay of overlap function @xmath58 using the definition @xmath59 . the overlap function is a two - point time correlation function of local density @xcite which has been used in many recent studies of slow relaxation , and is defined as : @xmath60 here the averaging over time origins @xmath61 is implied .",
    "the overlap function naturally separates into `` self '' and `` distinct '' terms : @xmath62 in our work , we consider only the self part of the total overlap function ( _ i.e. _ neglect the @xmath63 terms in the double summation ) , based on the observation @xcite that the results obtained from the self part are not significantly different from those obtained by considering the collective overlap function .",
    "thus we use + @xmath64 + further , for numerical computation , the @xmath65 function is approximated by a window function @xmath66 which defines the condition of `` overlap '' between two particle positions separated by a time interval @xmath67 : @xmath68 the time dependent overlap function thus depends on the choice of the cutoff parameter @xmath69 , which we choose to be @xmath70 .",
    "this parameter is chosen such that particle positions separated due to small amplitude vibrational motion are treated as the same , or that @xmath71 is comparable to the value of the msd in the plateau between the ballistic and diffusive regimes .",

    "the self intermediate scattering function is calculated from the simulated trajectory as : @xmath80        dynamics of fragile glass forming liquids show characteristic cross - over from high temperature arrhenius behaviour to low temperature super arrhenius behaviour at some characteristic temperature . at this temperature",
