    "our results are independent of the number of tunnelling pathways available through the system , although more than one seems necessary , indicating that an interference effect may be responsible for the robustness of these states .",

    "this point is specifically reflected in our findings as we only observe the fsc resonance under coupling anisotropies .",
    "these coupling anisotropies may play the role of a path difference between the channels , where specific path differences may quench transport through the system in an effect akin to negative differential conductance .",
    "@xcite in such a case the fsc is enhanced  forming a resonance  since the dominant decoherence pathways are also effectively quenched .",
    "this may also help explain the presence of the single dominant resonance in the range of the orbital anisotropy in our model , since only a specific energy and coupling configuration will lead to transport quenching .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the fsc of a fermionic system can be decoupled from the evolution of the population probabilities and the hsc of the system , even under the presence of boson - mediated relaxation and single - particle exchange with a bath .",
    "we demonstrated a resonant regime in this fsc where the decoherence times extend far beyond that of the hsc , and we have been able to relate these results to an analytically derived relationship in the coupling parameters of the system arising from the formation of a bound state between the system and reservoirs .",
    "we anticipate the primary difficulty in the experimental confirmation of our theory to be the establishment of the fsc in the first instance .",
    "what we have shown here is that such a fsc can exhibit a remarkable , robust , and long - lived resonance even in the presence of ordinarily very destructive perturbations such as particles tunnelling into and out of the system .",
    "a plausible configuration to obtain this fsc resonance effect is one where the particle reservoirs are macroscopic systems in thermodynamic equilibrium , as envisioned in the present work , and whose description is properly and most conveniently characterised by a particle density ( not particle number ) in a grand canonical ensemble .",
    "subsequent experimental and further theoretical efforts extending this work may shed light on the fundamental problem of decoherence , and on quantum information processing in a semiconductor environment ."
