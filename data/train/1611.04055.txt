    "the existence of conformal unit defining densities allows us to proliferate conformal hypersurface invariants as encapsulated by the following theorem :    suppose that @xmath8 is a conformal unit defining density and @xmath75 is a weight  @xmath76 coupled conformal invariant depending pointwise on at most the @xmath0-jet of @xmath8 .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath77 to @xmath2 is a weight  @xmath76 conformal hypersurface invariant .",

    "an application of these is the construction of scalar invariants that can not be directly reached from the above theorem .",
    "in particular , we can produce invariants of the weight @xmath81 that allows them to be integrated over a hypersurface .",
    "this exploited in the following result :    [ kin ] given a closed embedded hypersurface  @xmath2 in @xmath82 , the functional @xmath83 is a conformal invariant of  @xmath2 . with respect to variation of the embedding , the gradient of this functional is a conformal hypersurface invariant . for even dimensional hypersurfaces",

    "the last statement of theorem  [ kin ] shows that for @xmath2 of even dimension , these energy functionals are genuinely quadratic at leading order , meaning that their variational gradients are linear at linear leading order .",

    "apart from the new results established here , this paper is strongly linked to  @xcite . in one direction ,",
    "an objective here is to show how the formalism introduced in @xcite gives an effective calculus for the computation and treatment conformal hypersurface invariants . in the other direction , many of the results in @xcite can only be fully appreciated and exploited when reinterpreted in terms of basic riemannian geometry formulae ; producing these involves considerable subtlety , and so a second objective is illustrate how such formulae may be extracted .    in section  [ riemann ]",
    ", we review the theory of riemannian hypersurface invariants , and show how these may be treated via a riemannian analog of the singular yamabe problem . in section  [ canda ] we show how existence of conformal unit defining densities alone allows us to proliferate conformal hypersurface invariants . as an application , we compute the obstruction density in low dimensions .",

    "this methodology also yields efficient derivations of the relations of gau , codazzi , mainardi and ricci .",
    "for example , call @xmath152 . then from the second fundamental form preinvariant given in example  [ preinvariants ] , we see immediately that @xmath153 however , @xmath154 restricting the above relation to @xmath2 , applying the projector @xmath139 to the indices @xmath155 , @xmath156 and  @xmath157 , and then using the gau  formula  ( [ hypgrad ] ) , the above relation becomes the well known codazzi ",
