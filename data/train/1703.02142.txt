    "spintronics and magnetoelectronics constitute one of the most rapidly expanding research fields of materials science and condensed matter physics @xcite . the on - going research on the modelling of novel materials plays a key role in the advancements in this research field as it allows an  - la - carte design of materials for specific applications @xcite .",
    "in this respect , heusler compounds @xcite are widely studied due to the variety of magnetic properties exhibited , in particular , in combination with the half - metallicity @xcite .",
    "apart from half - metallic heusler compounds , also the ones being magnetic semiconductors are of interest for spintronic and magnetoelectronic applications @xcite .",
    "magnetic semiconductors can act as spin - filter materials ( sfms ) @xcite to maximize the efficiency of devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) @xcite , like the recently proposed spin - current diodes @xcite .",
    "a special class of magnetic semiconductors are the so - called spin - gapless semiconductors ( sgss ) , where one of the two spin channels presents a gapless or almost - gapless semiconducting behavior while the other spin channel possesses a finite gap at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "several studies have been devoted recently to the sfms and sgss .",
    "first - principles electronic band structure calculations have suggested that the ordered quaternary ( cov)yal and ( crv)yal heusler compounds @xcite - where y stands for ti , zr , or hf - are sfms @xcite",
    ". the former compounds are ferromagnetic semiconductors , while the latter ones are fully - compensated ferrimagnetic semiconductors , as they combine the existence of energy gaps in both spin directions to zero magnetization @xcite .",
    "both families of heusler sfms present high curie temperatures well above the room temperature and , thus , are of interest for room - temperature spintronic / magnetoelectronic applications contrary to other well known sfms @xcite .",
    "the fully - compensated ferrimagnetic character of ( crv)yal compounds makes them even more attractive for applications as the zero net magnetization leads to vanishing stray fields and thus to minimal energy losses .",
    "recently , stephen and collaborators have successfully grown samples of ( crv)tial and their measurements confirm the _ ab - initio _ predictions @xcite .",
    "sgs materials are known for almost a decade @xcite .",
    "although several _ ab - initio _ calculations had suggested that the band structure of mn@xmath1coal , an inverse heusler compound @xcite , is compatible with that of an sgs material @xcite , it was not until 2013 when experiments by ouardi et al",
    ". confirmed the sgs character of mn@xmath1coal in bulk - like pollycrystalline films and measured a curie temperature of 720 k far above the room temperature @xcite . also .",
    "experiments were carried out on thin films of mn@xmath1coal on various substrates ; films on top of gaas were found to deviate from sgs @xcite , while films on thermally oxidized si substrates were found to be sgs with a curie temperature of 550 k @xcite .",
    "these experimental findings were accompanied by several _",
    "ab - initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , and also ti@xmath1cosi , ti@xmath1mnal , ti@xmath1vas and cr@xmath1znsi have been identified as potential sgs materials sublattices @xcite . simultaneously , several theoretical studies appeared dealing with the various phenomena that affect the sgs character of these compounds with a focus mainly on mn@xmath1coal @xcite .",
    "lattice structure , the quaternary ordered ones , which include also the spin - filter materials , and the inverse heusler compounds adopting the @xmath2 ( also known as @xmath3 ) lattice structure which is identical to that of the spin - gapless semiconducting heusler compounds . in all cases ,",
    "the lattice consists of four interpenetrating fcc lattices .",
    "for sgs materials the most important property is the zero gap in the majority - spin or spin - up ( for materials with zero magnetization where we can not distinguish majority and minority spins ) electronic band structure . in the case of sfms",
    "the most important property is the energy difference in the bottom of the conduction band for the two spin directions , the exchange splitting @xmath4 , which corresponds to the difference of the barrier that spin up and spin down electrons confront when they tunnel through the sfm @xcite .",
    "this exchange splitting for the sfms under study is about 0.1 - 0.3 ev @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy quantities characterizing the sgss and sfms are relatively small .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the second part of our study , we focus on the sgs materials , namely cr@xmath1znsi , mn@xmath1coal , ti@xmath1cosi , and ti@xmath1mnal . the magnetic moments and the exchange splitting can be found in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the calculated magnetic energy ( difference between the total energy for a spin - polarized and a non - spin - polarized calculation ) suggests that these compounds prefer the magnetic configuration and especially for mn@xmath1coal , which is the prototype the value approaches -1 ev , and this explains why this was the first sgs heusler to be grown .",
    "only cr@xmath1znsi has a very small magnetic energy of -0.11 ev and thus would be more difficult to stabilize its magnetic phase in experiments .",
    "the spin magnetic moments have been already presented in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "thus , we will only shortly discuss them here .",
    "the most noticeable difference between this study and the one in reference @xcite is that for mn@xmath1coal we have used the experimental lattice constant of 5.798  , while in @xcite the equilibrium lattice constant of 5.73   was employed .",
    "the larger experimental lattice constant leads to spin magnetic moments of larger absolute values , but the total spin magnetic moment per formula unit remains equal to 2 @xmath5 and mn@xmath1coal is a sgs for both lattice constants .",
    "the exchange splitting values presented in the last column of table [ table1 ] are of more interest .",
    "sgs materials can also act as spin filters since they are just a special case of magnetic semiconductors . with the exception of ti@xmath1cosi , the sgss under study present exchange splitting energies much larger than the sfms studied in the previous section . for mn@xmath1coal and ti@xmath1mnal",
    "the use of @xmath0 instead of pbe has a minimal effect on the obtained values contrary to the other two materials . for ti@xmath1cosi",
    ", @xmath0 produces an almost vanishing exchange splitting , while for cr@xmath1znsi @xmath0 almost doubles the exchange splitting with respect to the pbe .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we present the spin - resolved band structure for mn@xmath1coal using both the pbe functional and the @xmath0 approximation .",
    "contrary to ( cov)tial and ( crv)tial presented in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , the situation for mn@xmath1coal is completely different .",
    "close to the fermi level , @xmath0 has a minimal effect on the band structure for both spin directions , and hence the energy band gaps and the transition energies presented in table [ table3 ] are only marginally affected .",
    "the majority spin band gap is 0.02 ev within @xmath0 and 0.05 ev within pbe , and the sgs character is conserved . in the minority spin band structure",
    "the @xmath0 calculated band gap is just 0.06 ev larger than the pbe one .",
    "similarly for the transition energies for mn@xmath1coal , the discrepancy between the pbe and @xmath0 calculated values is marginal , especially for the majority - spin band structure .",
    "the other three compounds show a similar behavior . in the two compounds containing ti atoms ( ti@xmath1cosi and ti@xmath1mnal )",
    "@xmath0 slightly enlarges the band gaps and the transition energies , similarly to the case of the sfms . in the case of cr@xmath1znsi",
    "the situation is opposite , and the @xmath0 renormalization slightly decreases the energy band gaps , especially for the minority - spin band structure .",
    "overall , in the case of the sgs materials , the @xmath0 self - energy has only a small effect on the electronic band structure , but it may affect the exchange splittings significantly with consequences for spin - filter related applications .",
    "the @xmath0 approximation for the electronic self - energy was employed to account for many - body exchange - correlation effects as a correction to standard density - functional theory calculations using the pbe functional .",
    "we have studied the properties of two distinct subfamilies of the full - heusler compounds : ( i ) the ordered quaternary ( also known as limgpdsn - type ) heusler compounds having the chemical formula ( cov)yal and ( crv)yal , where y is ti or zr , and which are magnetic semiconductors ( known as spin - filter materials ) , and ( ii ) the so - called inverse heusler compounds with the chemical formula x@xmath1yz which are spin - gapless semiconductors and thus present a gapless or almost - gapless semiconducting behavior in the majority spin band structure combined with a finite energy gap in the other spin channel .",
    "our first - principles results suggest that the use of @xmath0 is important for the spin - filter materials .",
    "it shifts both valence and conduction bands away from the fermi level leading to larger energy band gap values as well as larger transition energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of employing @xmath0 is smaller in the spin - gapless semiconductors and the usual density - functional theory gives a fair description of the properties of these materials .",
    "thus the effect of the @xmath0 approximation is material - specific even among materials of the same family with similar electronic and magnetic properties and its use seems essential to get a good description of their electronic properties .",
    "we hope that our results further enhance the interest in these classes of heusler compounds and that they contribute to the understanding of their extraordinary properties .",
