    "the development of the high - power femtosecond laser has stimulated the investigation of the multi - photon processes of atoms and molecules interacting with intense laser fields [ 1 - 9 ] .",
    "recently , there are many theoretical and experimental references about these multiphoton process . within a proper intensity region ,",
    "lots of odd harmonics of laser are generated by atomic and molecular gases [ 1 - 5,14 ] .",
    "the harmonic structure distributes as a plateau which is cut off at a special high - order harmonic . when the intensity increases , the ionization channel is opened and the high - order harmonics disappear . the above threshold ionization ( ati ) occurs when the laser intensity is sufficient power ( above @xmath0 ) .",
    "various structures ( plateau , angular distribution , etc . ) in ati spectra have been detailed in ref.[6 - 8 ] .",
    "the above threshold dissociation ( atd ) and dissociation - ionization of molecular systems are also reported [ 9 - 10 ] .",
    "studying the laser - matter interaction deeply , not only can obtain new knowledge of the interacting mechanism , but also can provide widely application in the generation of high - order coherent harmonics , @xmath1-rays laser and @xmath2-rays laser .",
    "the classical dynamics of most laser - driven systems is generally chaotic , due to the existence of nonlinearity .",
    "chaos usually manifests itself as some control parameters ( initial energy , laser intensity , laser frequency , etc . )",
    "are varied .",
    "the microscopic systems , in particular those involving atoms and molecules , are governed by a hamiltonian . to study these systems are of great importance in the context of quantum - classical correspondence . at the investigated high power laser intensity @xmath3 ,",
    "the electric field of the laser is equal in strength to the coulomb field of the nuclei [ 8 ] , and the laser field can not be looked as a perturbation to the field - free system , for the states themselves are no longer independent of the laser .",
    "generally , the microscopic systems ( atoms or molecules ) are intrinsically quantum mechanical systems , thus they must be described by quantum mechanics . however , due to the presence of intense laser , the exact calculation even numerical simulation based upon quantum mechanics tend to be very difficult to perform . fortunately",
    ", classical approach to these similar problems is useful for providing physical insight into dynamics processes [ 10 - 13 ] .",
    "classical chaos associating with the microwave ionization of atomic hydrogen reveals that the detailed mechanism of atomic ionization in terms of transport in phase space [ 11 - 12 ] .",
    "classical prediction for scaled frequencies has been verified by quantum calculations [ 12 - 13 ] , and , in turn , has confirmed the dynamical significance of classical chaos .",
    "the harmonic generation ( hg ) of laser driven hydrogen atoms is simulated with classical monte - carlo method [ 14 ] , the numerical results are qualitatively consistent with the quantum mechanic results and the experimental observation . for the molecular systems ,",
    "the classical calculation is a good first step , since length and energy scales are often large enough for classical mechanics to be at least approximately valid . using softened potential model , the classical dynamics of the one - dimensional hydrogen molecular ion @xmath4 interacting with an intense laser pulse are detailed [ 15 - 16 ] .",
    "there are two important and realistic examples of laser driven systems , where nonlinear dynamics has played a major role , which have been traditionally studied .",
    "one is the laser driven hydrogen atom that is the fundamental system in atomic physics , the other is the laser driven hydrogen molecular ion @xmath4 , which is the fundamental diatomic molecular system in molecular physics .",
    "bellow , we shall show our classical calculation of the high - order harmonic generation of these two fundamental systems .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the regularized model and the corresponding initial microcanonical distribution are presented in the next section . in section iii",
    ", we show the numerical results in details .",
    "a briefly summary and discussion is given out in the last section .",
    "in this article , we consider a classical hydrogen atom , with an infinite mass nucleus fixed at the origin of coordinates , interacting with a high intense laser field which is linearly polarized along the @xmath5 , and with the electric field component @xmath6 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian in atomic units in cartesian coordinates is @xmath7 where , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "apparently , the above hamiltonian has a coulomb singularity corresponding to electron - nucleus collision . to remedy the singularity",
    ", we introduce the parabolic coordinates @xmath10@xmath11 and a new fictive time scale @xmath12@xmath13 in order to implement regularization , following the notation of szebenhely [ 17 ] , regarding the motion time @xmath14 and the negative total energy @xmath15 as generalized coordinate and generalized momentum respectively , then the hamiltonian function in extended space becomes into @xmath16 for the sake of obtaining the regularized hamiltonian , we introduce the third category generating function @xmath17 , then obtain @xmath18 so the third category generating function @xmath19 is in the form of @xmath20 the new momenta @xmath21 are related with old momenta @xmath22 by @xmath23 then the regularized hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath24 - 2-e(u^{2}+v^{2})-\\frac{1}{2}(v^{4}-u^{4})\\varepsilon ( t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we define @xmath25 - 1-eu^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}% u^{4}\\varepsilon ( t ) ,   \\nonumber \\\\",

    ", we can assume that two protons are fixed at the positions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with a distance @xmath37 away from each other , in the locations @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the cartesian coordinates system .",
    "a single electron at @xmath40 is subject to the coulomb attraction of both protons and the interaction of the laser .",
    "let @xmath41 be its distance from @xmath35 , and @xmath42 be its distance from @xmath36 . within the dipole approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian in atomic units is @xmath43 where , @xmath6 is the electric field of the laser pulse , @xmath44 is the interacting hamiltonian .",
    "apparently , the above hamiltonian has singularities at points @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which corresponds to electron - proton collision . to overcome this barrier",
    ", regularization has to be performed .",
    "define the new coordinates @xmath10 as @xmath47 and introduce the new fictive time scale @xmath12 satisfying @xmath48 similar to the previous subsection , regarding the motion time @xmath14 and the negative total energy @xmath15 as generalized coordinate and generalized momentum respectively , then we can write the hamiltonian function in extended space as @xmath16 introducing the third category generating function @xmath49 , which satisfies @xmath50 thus momenta @xmath21 are related with old momenta @xmath22 by @xmath51 and the regularized hamiltonian is @xmath52-r\\cosh v-\\frac{(e - h_{i})}{4}r^{2}(\\cosh ^{2}v-\\cos ^{2}u).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath53 .",

    "equations of the motion for the ground - state hydrogen molecular ion interacting with laser field can be easily obtained from the regularized hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the field - free case , defining @xmath59 thus @xmath27 is a constant of the field - free motion , they are related to @xmath2 and @xmath60 by @xmath61 constants @xmath60 and @xmath2 are first introduced by erickson [ 18 ] and strand [ 19 ] respectively , which have the following forms @xmath62 here , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the angular momentum vector of the motion around nucleus @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the angle from the vector @xmath67 and @xmath68 to positive @xmath5 respectively , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the mass and the charge of the electron respectively .      the action - angle variables for separated systems are defined as @xmath71 the motion of the classical field - free hydrogen atom is periodic , then it need only a pair of conjugated action - angle variables [ 20 ] @xmath72 the corresponding angle is given by the kepler s equation @xmath73 this means @xmath74 is the mean anomaly of the free orbits .",

    "so the spectrum obtained from a single trajectory exhibits unphysical even harmonics . a natural way to remedy the unphysical even harmonics",
    "is to consider an ensemble of trajectories , evolving from an initial microcanonical distribution with inversion symmetry . for a chaotic system",
    ", the initial distribution can be generated with monte - carlo method .",
    "however , for an integrable system , the distribution generated by monte - carlo method does not possess of ergodicity .",
    "we find that the points on the same equienergy surface generated by action - angle variables with regular steps possess of good ergodicity .",
    "to reconstruct the inversion symmetry , there must exist pairs of @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the initial distribution .",

    "the numerical computational procedure is based upon the classical trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) method [ 20 - 21 ] .",
    "ctmc simulation procedure involves three stages , ( i ) choice of initial conditions , ( ii ) numerical integration of equation of motion , and ( iii ) categorization of each trajectory as excitation , charge transfer or ionization . in the process of numerical integrating ,",
    "numerical accuracy and computing time are two primary aspects that must be considered .",
    "we use the fourth - order runge - kutta method with variable steps to perform the numerical calculation .",
    "note also that computer can not deal with singularity , which corresponds to electron - nucleus collision , to overcome this difficulty , we have implemented regularization . with complete regularization , numerical simulation can be established with required precision before , at , and , after collision successfully .    to obtain the harmonic spectra , our procedure",
    "also calculate the averaged dipole moment of the excited trajectories with pairs of inversion symmetric initial conditions in the same distribution .",
    "having determined the actual trajectories of the electron , one can easily obtain the component of the averaged dipole moment , which along the laser polarization direction .",
    "then the harmonic spectra of the driven dipole is straightforwardly obtained from it s power spectra @xmath93 where , @xmath94 is the component of the averaged dipole moment along the laser polarization direction . in our calculation ,",
    "the electric fields of the ultrashort laser pulses are chosen as @xmath95 the maximum electric field strength @xmath96 is related to the laser intensity @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the angular frequency , and period @xmath99 is equal to @xmath100 .    the time - dependent dipole moment @xmath101 of a single trajectory along the laser polarization direction sensitively depends on the laser intensity .",
    "fig.1 shows the time evolution of the dipole of the hydrogen molecular ion with initial energy @xmath102 @xmath103 , internuclear distance @xmath104 @xmath105 , laser wavelength @xmath106 @xmath107 and different laser intensity . and some dipoles of the hydrogen atom and their power spectra are presented in fig.2 , with initial energy @xmath108 @xmath103 , laser wavelength @xmath109 @xmath107 and different laser intensity . with the increasing of the laser intensity , the oscillations of the dipole moments are modulated gradually , and it follows a regular pattern with both high and low frequency components .",
    "such patterns are independent of initial conditions .",
    "when the laser intensity is large enough , ionization takes place , which strongly modifies the subsequent time evolution of the dipole moment .    the power spectra obtained from a single trajectory of the laser driven hydrogen molecular ion , which with initial energy @xmath102 @xmath103 , internuclear distance @xmath104 @xmath105 , laser wavelength @xmath106 @xmath107 and different laser intensity , are presented in fig.3 .",
    "the first one corresponds to the field - free case . for the hydrogen atom ,",
    "it possesses of only regularly decreasing peaks locating at multiples ( harmonics ) of kepler s frequency , that is , @xmath110 , for @xmath111 , which manifests that the free motion is periodic . while for the hydrogen molecular ion",
    ", the free motion is quasi - periodic , it appears regularly decreasing peaks locating at two different characteristic frequencies and their combinations , i.e. , at @xmath112 , for @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 . for the laser driven systems , the peaks of harmonic spectra depend strongly on the laser intensity .",
    "in addition to the origin peaks , a dominant line at the laser frequency @xmath98 appears , which is the rayleigh component in the light scattered by the atoms and molecular ions .",
    "high - order harmonics , which consist of both odd and even components , do appear in the spectra , and their orders and strengths increase with the increasing of the laser intensity . for a low laser intensity ,",
    "i.e. , in the perturbative regime , the characteristic peaks dominate the power spectrum . for a proper laser intensity , the plateau structure containing both odd and even harmonics appears . for a larger laser intensity , because of the presence of chaos , the spectra become noisier even the motion is bound . for a strong enough laser intensity ,",
    "the motion becomes unbound and the corresponding spectrum is dominated by a very noise background , which is generated by the ionized electrons , the only line surviving being the one at the laser frequency , which corresponds to the light scattered by the asymptotically free electron thomson scattering .    to eliminate",
    "the unphysical even harmonics , averaging an ensemble of trajectories evolving from an inversion symmetric distribution is necessary .",
    "the time evolution of the averaged dipole , which evolve from a microcanonical ensemble of 5000 trajectories , are presented in fig.4 , the first one corresponds to the hydrogen atom with initial energy @xmath108 @xmath116 , laser wavelength @xmath117 @xmath107 and laser intensity @xmath118 @xmath119 , the second one corresponds to the hydrogen molecular ion with initial energy @xmath102 @xmath103 , internuclear distance @xmath104 @xmath105 , laser wavelength @xmath106 @xmath107 and laser intensity @xmath120 @xmath119 .",
    "comparing with the evolution of the dipole of a single trajectory , one can easily find that the oscillation of the averaged dipole is smooth and it globally follows the laser oscillation .",
    "the spectra obtained from an ensemble of trajectories are showed in fig.5 and fig.6 .",

    "the unphysical even harmonics are remedied really . within a proper laser intensity range ,",
    "the plateau structure that only possesses of odd harmonics appears .",
    "as pointed out previously , at a higher intensity , the spectra become noisier even the ionization does not happen because of the effects of chaos .",
    "this indicates that the chaos cause the noise of the harmonic spectra .",
    "when the laser intensity is high enough , the ionization takes place , thus the noise background conceals the high - order harmonics .",
    "this means that the onset of ionization follows the onset of chaos and the ionization suppresses the harmonic generation .",
    "in summary , within the born - oppenheimer approximation and using the classical trajectory method , we have calculated the high - order harmonic generation spectra of the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen molecular ion interacting with ultrashort intense laser pulses .",
    "the other multi - photon phenomena , such as multi - photon ionization and above threshold dissociation , can also be simulated . in our subsequent calculations ,",
    "the dynamics of the electron is investigated by numerical integrating the equations of motion using regularized coordinates .",
    "to eliminate the unphysical even harmonics of a single trajectory , averaging over an ensemble of trajectories evolving from an initial microcanonical distribution with inversion symmetry is necessary .",
    "such distribution is constructed using action - angle variables . a plateau structure in the spectra with only odd harmonics",
    "is observed within a proper laser intensity range of about @xmath121 @xmath119 . from our numerical results ,",
    "we observe that the high order harmonics are cut off at a special order harmonic . at higher laser intensities",
    ", chaos introduces noise into the spectra even though the motion is still bound .",
    "finally as the intensity is further increased , ionization takes place , and the harmonics disappear .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with recent quantum calculations [ 16 ] and experimental observations [ 1 - 5 ] , but the cutoff order @xmath122 of the plateau structure is not precisely consistent with formula @xmath123[27 ] , here , @xmath124 is the ionization potential and @xmath125 denotes the quiver energy or the ponderomotive energy of an electron . as an example , when the laser intensity @xmath126 @xmath119 and wavelength @xmath127 @xmath107 , the ionization potential @xmath124 of the ground - state hydrogen molecular ion is @xmath128 @xmath103 @xmath129 @xmath130 , the quiver energy @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 , then @xmath134 , and when @xmath135 @xmath119 , @xmath136 ; however , from our simulation , the harmonic plateau are both cut off at @xmath137 , and for very large intensity ( above @xmath138 @xmath119 ) the high - order harmonics are concealed by the noises . to obtain quantitative results",
    ", we have to integrate the time - dependent schr@xmath139dinger equation , this can be realized with the split - operator method [ 22 ] . for the hydrogen molecular ion , within boa , a proper internuclear distance @xmath37 will enhance the high - order harmonic generation[16 ] , and",
    "it will be interesting to go beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation to investigate what further interesting insights can be obtained when the nuclear motion is taken into account [ 23 - 24 ] .    in our model , we only consider the non - relativistic case with dipole approximation . when the laser is sufficiently intense , photoelectrons of relativistic energies can be produced , necessitating a fully relativistic treatment [ 25 ] .",
    "the dipole approximation is no longer valid , and the magnetic field is not only present , but acquires an importance similar to that of the electric field . and even before the appearance of the relativistic photoelectrons ,",
    "the effects of the magnetic field may be very important too [ 26 ] . due to the wiggly motion and the acceleration of the electron near the outermost turning points induced by the magnetic field , the cut - off order of the harmonic plateau maybe higher .",
