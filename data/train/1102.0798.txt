    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are strong sources of optical and x - ray radiation .",
    "their emission is commonly thought to be composed of two main components : thermal blackbody type radiation emerging from a geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disc in the optical / uv band , and a non - thermal power - law type hard x - ray tail believed to be formed by inverse compton up - scattering of the disc seed photons by energetic electrons in a hot plasma , so called x - ray corona ( e.g. magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 ; chiang 2002 ; chiang & blaes 2003 ; sobolewska , ycki & siemiginowska 2004a , b ; middleton , done & gierliski 2007 ; vasudevan & fabian 2009 ) .",
    "dependencies between the x - ray and optical / uv luminosities , and the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in different cosmic times are studied to constrain accretion models , understand agn variability , agn influence on intergalactic medium and a contribution to the x - ray background .",
    "these dependencies have been investigated by many authors ( e.g. young , elvis & risaliti 2010 ; grupe et al .",

    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "most of the authors agree that the x - ray loudness , defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are monochromatic luminosities at the rest frame optical / uv and x - ray energies , @xmath7 and @xmath8 kev , respectively , correlates primarily with l@xmath9 , and that there is a strong correlation between l@xmath9 and l@xmath10 .",
    "the correlation between the rest frame 210 kev x - ray photon index , @xmath11 , and optical / uv or x - ray luminosities is still a matter of debate , however a correlation of @xmath11 with the eddington luminosity ratio has been reported by several authors ( e.g. grupe 2004 , kelly et al .",
    "2008 , sobolewska & papadakis 2009 ) .",
    "kelly et al .",
    "( 2008 ) pointed out that this correlation may be induced by the underlying dependence of the x - ray photon index on the mass accretion rate .",
    "grupe ( 2006 ) found a mild correlation between the x - ray loudness and the x - ray spectral index , @xmath12 = @xmath13 , but its significance was low .",
    "in addition , correlations of @xmath1 and @xmath11 with redshift are studied in attempt to discover how quasars have been evolving over the cosmic time .",
    "it seems that quasars seds become more x - ray quiet for higher redshifts , but no significant intrinsic dependence of @xmath11 on the redshift was found .",
    "galactic black hole binaries ( gbhs ) represent another class of accreting black holes . similarly to agn , they also accrete matter through an accretion disc emitting thermal x - rays , posses a hard x - ray emitting corona and may show collimated outflows in the form of jets , or uncollimated outflows , the so called disc winds .",
    "gbhs exhibit state transitions that can be followed throughout the entire outburst cycle of the duration of the order of @xmath14100 days .",
    "the gbhs state transitions happen on timescales of hours or shorter .",
    "therefore , x - ray spectra of gbhs provide a way to study properties of the disc - corona accretion system at different luminosity levels .    signatures of agn outbursts and their different luminosity states have been recently observed in x - rays ( for example observations of clusters of galaxies , e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2001 , mcnamarra & nulsen 2007 ; compact radio sources , e.g. czerny et al . 2009 ; and x - ray jets , e.g. siemiginowska et al .",
    "however , in the case of agn characteristic transition timescales exceed 10@xmath15 years , as the timescales are thought to scale inversely with the black hole mass , and so agn population studies are needed in order to identify sources in different spectral states ( e.g. krding , jester & fender 2006 ) .",
    "one way to deal with this difficulty is to follow gbhs spectral evolution through different states and then apply its pattern to a population of agn to identify their states .",
    "the rossi x - ray timing experiment ( rxte ) archives contain gbh data that cover many complete x - ray outbursts , during which an object emerges from the quiescence , reaches a significant fraction of eddington luminosity , and fades away .",
    "application of even simple models to these data leads to a good phenomenological understanding of accretion mechanism at different luminosity levels .",
    "spectral studies accompanied by studies of the high quality x - ray power spectra facilitate classification of gbhs spectral states ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; done , gierliski & kubota 2007 ) .",
    "the situation is quite different in the case of agn .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the typical timescales in accreting black holes are inversely proportional to the black hole mass , and so the timescales of state transitions in agn are too long to be covered by an observing run . as a consequence ,",
    "it is unlikely to observe a state transition of an individual agn .",
    "however , a large enough unbiased sample of agn should contain a mixture of objects in different spectral states . still , it is not trivial to determine a spectral state of an agn relying solely on the x - ray power - law like continuum .",
    "the galactic black hole binaries phenomenology clearly shows that a sed with a typical x - ray photon index @xmath16 may be representative of a hard , intermediate , or very high spectral state .",
    "even though these gbh states show similar hard x - ray spectra , the properties of their thermal disc components peaking in soft x - rays around 1 kev differ dramatically ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; done et al .",
    "2007 ) . since the mass of the accreting black hole affects the characteristic temperature of the accretion disc emission : the disc spectrum of more massive objects shifts towards lower energies . as a result agn s discs emerge in the optical / uv band .",
    "confirmed gbhs are homogeneous in terms of the mass of the compact object and they all contain black holes with mass of the order of several solar masses ( see e.g. done & gierliski 2003 , remillard & mcclintock 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , the agn samples contain black holes that differ in mass by 34 orders of magnitude ( e.g. grupe et al .",
    "2010 ; merloni et al .",
    "2010 ; shen et al .",
    "2008 ; kelly et al .",
    "unfortunately , good quality simultaneous agn data covering a multiwavelength optical / uv to hard x - ray band are rarely available .",
    "consequently , it is not straightforward to disentangle the intrinsic and apparent ( e.g. due to absorption or reflection ) agn x - ray spectral variability and develop an agn spectral state phenomenology , similar to that of gbhs . the method to assign spectral states to agn based on their power spectra ( see e.g. uttley & mchardy 2005 , arvalo et al .",
    "2006 , mchardy et al .",
    "2007 ) can be applied only to a few best monitored objects with quality light curves .",
    "clearly , there is a need to develop indirect methods of assigning the accretion mode to the seds of agn .    in sobolewska , gierliski , siemiginowska ( 2009 , hereafter paper i )",
    "we defined the disc - to - power law index for galactic black hole binaries , @xmath17 , which corresponds to the x - ray loudness parameter , @xmath1 , used to characterize the agn broad - band optical / uv / x - ray spectra .",
    "the @xmath18 + 1 $ ] ( where @xmath19 denotes the @xmath20 flux in erg @xmath21 s@xmath22 ) was defined as the index of a nominal power law between the 3 kev , where the accretion disc dominates the spectrum of a gbh ( with the exception of the hard state ) and 20 kev , where the spectrum is dominated by a power law emission , modelled as comptonization of the seed disc photons in the hot corona .",
    "the @xmath23 accounts for the many orders on magnitude difference between the energies for which the @xmath24 and @xmath1 are defined ( 3-to-20 kev and 2500 - to-2 kev , respectively ) .",
    "we showed that the distribution of @xmath23 shows three distinctive peaks around @xmath141 , 1.5 and 2 , which correspond to hard , intermediate / very high and soft spectral states , respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath25 and so @xmath1 , together with the x - ray photon index , can be indicators of a spectral state of accreting black holes .",
    "in the present paper we develop the paper i idea in more detail .",
    "we use the gbh phenomenology to simulate an outburst of agn .",
    "we use a physical model of accretion to describe the spectra of a representative gbh , gro  j1655 - 40 , at various luminosity levels , and then we scale the seed photons temperature and bolometric luminosity in the best fitting models with mass , as in the standard shakura - sunyaev disc case , to study accretion onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "next , we separate the simulated agn spectral states in the @xmath1 vs. @xmath5 plane for various classes of agn , including broad and narrow line type 1 seyferts and liners .",
    "we investigate if the mass spread in the observed agn samples can contribute to the observed correlation between the x - ray loudness , @xmath26 ) and monochromatic luminosity at 2500 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the data selection criteria and data reduction procedure as well as give details of data modeling .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] we present our method of mass scaling of a gbh outburst to the case of agn . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] we present simulated spectra , resulting correlations between the parameters , and compare our work with observational samples .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dc ] we discuss and conclude our results .",
    "gbh binaries undergo violent events during which their luminosity may increase by more than 3 orders of magnitude . during these outbursts",
    "the sources show variety of different x - ray spectral shapes ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; done et al .",
    "this spectral variability is relatively well understood ( e.g. gierliski & done 2004 ) .",
    "typical peak outburst luminosities do not exceed 0.30.5@xmath27 ( e.g. done et al .",
    "this is most probably connected to the physics of the accretion discs that become unstable at high @xmath27 ( e.g. merloni 2003 , merloni & nayakshin 2006 ) .",
    "a few gbhs sporadically reach the high eddington ratios ( see e.g. references in done et al .",
    "2006 ) , but only grs 1915 + 105 accretes steadily at eddington ratios @xmath28 .",
    "it was shown in done , wardziski , gierliski ( 2004 ) , however , that grs  1915 + 105 occupies a different region in their color - color diagram than the normal gbhs , and it never goes into a normal hard or soft state .    in our study",
    "we are looking for a well monitored outburst of a _ typical _ gbh , that would display a variety of different spectral states , and could be easily described with a standard disc+corona model . for these reasons , we have selected the 2005 outburst of a confirmed galactic x - ray black hole binary gro  j165540 hosting a 6.3m@xmath29 black hole , located at the distance of 3.2 kpc , with inclination of 30@xmath30 ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "the lightcurve of the outburst is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop]a . the x - ray bolometric luminosity ( calculated based on the extrapolated 0.011000 kev flux of the best fitting models ) changed by more than 3 orders of magnitude , and at the peak of the outburst the system reached @xmath142030% of the eddington luminosity .    in 2005",
    "gro  j1655 - 40 displayed a variety of gbh spectral states ( e.g. brocksopp et al .",
    "2006 ; done et al .",
    "2007 ) , with the spectral variations covering a typical range for its class .",
    "this can be seen e.g. in the patterns followed by gro  j1655 - 40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loop]b ) and other gbhs ( sobolewska et al . 2009 ) in the @xmath31 vs. monochromatic luminosity at 3 kev diagrams , and also in the hardness - intensity diagrams presented for other gbhs ( e.g. fender , belloni & gallo 2004 , belloni et al . 2005 ) .",
    "hence , we argue that the 2005 data of gro  j1655 - 40 provide a reasonable sed template to study accretion mechanisms onto a black hole at various luminosity levels .",
    "we note , however , that the hard - to - soft state transition in 2005 outburst of gro  j1655 - 40 happened at @xmath32 , while it was shown that such a transition may also happen in gbh at much higher ratios , @xmath330.3@xmath34 ( gierliski & newton 2006 ) .",
    "thus our template may lack luminous hard state seds , and we discuss its implications later on .",
    "we reduced all data of the 2005 outburst found in the public heasarc using ftools ver .",
    "we extracted pca spectra for detector 2 , top layer only and hexte spectra from both clusters ; one spectrum per pointed observation ( see paper i for the details of data reduction ) .",
    "for modeling we used xspec ver .",
    "11.3 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "it has been shown ( e.g. gierliski et al . 1999 , done & gierliski 2003 ) that the spectral evolution of gbh during an outburst can be explained in terms of variations of the soft photons temperature and hard - to - soft compactness ratio , which depends mostly on the geometry of the disc - corona system . following these authors , we described the spectra with a sum of the disc blackbody component ( diskbb ) and comptonization ( eqpair , coppi 1999 ) .",
    "the eqpair code gives the ratio between the power in seed photons , @xmath35 and hot electrons , @xmath36 .",
    "this ratio , @xmath37 , depends mostly on the geometry of the accretion flow and defines the spectral shape of the hard x - ray continuum .",
    "typically , the hard state is characterized by @xmath38 , ( ultra ) soft state by @xmath39 and very high / intermediate state by @xmath40 .",
    "the other important model parameters include the optical depth , @xmath41 , the temperature of the seed photons , @xmath42 , and the ratio of the nonthermal - to - thermal compactness @xmath43 .",
    "the index of the injected non - thermal electrons was fixed at @xmath44 in all but 14 cases for which the fits resulted in @xmath45 .",
    "the model is not very sensitive to the changes of the total compactness @xmath46 .",
    "the eqpair also accounts for a reflection of the hard x - rays from a cold medium ( presumably an accretion disc ) .",
    "this reflected component is parametrized by the reflection amplitude and ionization parameter .",
    "the complete model used in xspec was defined as constant*wabs(diskbb+eqpair ) , where constant allows for normalization between pca and hexte data and wabs models the galactic absorption with @xmath47 fixed at 0.8@xmath48@xmath21 ( done & gierliski 2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "the eqpair model is particularly well suited for our study because it allowes for straight forward scaling of the spectra between the accreting black holes of different mass by applying due corrections to the seed photons temperature , while keeping the geometry of accretion constant .",
    "we modeled 94 hard state spectra of the outburst and 38 representative soft state spectra ; 132 data sets in total .",
    "the times of the data sets that we used are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop]a .",
    "we set a lower limit of 0.4 kev on the disc photons temperature , @xmath49 , and in the case of the hard state spectra we fix @xmath49 at 0.4 kev",
    ". fits to 119 data sets ( 90% ) result in the null hypothesis probability , @xmath50 , greater than 5% .",
    "the remaining 13 data sets with @xmath51% show residuals around 67 kev which are reminiscent of an iron line emission , which is not computed together with the reflected component by the eqpair code .",
    "thus in these 13 cases we include explicitly the relativistic line model of laor ( 1991 ) , laor .",
    "we fix the emissivity of the line at 3 , and the inner and outer radius at the values used to compute the reflected component in eqpair : 20 and 1000 gravitational radii , respectively .",
    "after addition of the line , the fits to 9 of 13 data sets resulted in @xmath51% .",
    "we notice that it has been reported by e.g. sala et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and miller et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that xmm - newton and chandra spectra of gro  j1655 - 40 , respectively , show features implying strong accretion disc winds . a number of absorption lines in the 79 kev band have been observed .",
    "however , rxte has a much poorer energy resolution than chandra or xmm - newton , and so we are not able to handle properly these absorption features .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that we have found a model that fits well 128 of 132 considered data sets , which means that the model fits our set of data well from the statistical point of view ( see e.g. sobolewska & papadakis 2009 ) .",
    "an example of soft / hard state models fitted to the gro  j1655 - 40 data is shown in figs .",

    "the disc temperature scales with the black hole mass as @xmath54 , and the bolometric luminosity is proportional to the black hole mass , @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that the accretion flow geometry , and hence the heating to cooling compactness ratio , @xmath37 , varies in the same way as the function of the mass accretion rate both in galactic and supermassive black holes .",
    "we set the normalization of the iron line , when present in the baseline spectrum , to zero , since it does not contribute significantly to the total simulated agn flux .",
