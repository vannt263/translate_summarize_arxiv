    "note that the present values of @xmath5 are in the ballpark of the values so far reported in the literature @xcite . at low temperatures pinning",
    "effects give rise to the rather large errors in the anisotropy parameter , preventing a reliable determination of @xmath5 for @xmath76  k. in order to demonstrate that the strong temperature dependence of @xmath5 is not an artefact of the increasing pinning strength at low temperatures , we compared shaked and unshaked torque data .",
    "one would expect that the shaked data are close to the reversible thermal equilibrium state .",
    "however , as indicated by the open and closed symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] there is within error bars no difference between the values of @xmath5 determined with and without shaking , attesting that the used procedure to determine @xmath5 below the irreversibility line is still reliable @xcite .",

    "[ fig3 ] , for 0.6 t @xmath78 t no field dependence of @xmath5 could be detected , suggesting that the measured anisotropy parameter in this work is @xmath79 .",

    "( [ kogan ] ) in the presence of weak pinning is the upper critical field @xmath60 as it enters only logarithmically into the formula .",

    "the exponent @xmath90 is close to @xmath99 for the two - fluid model , characteristic for a superconductor in the strong - coupling limit @xcite .",

    "therefore , the unusual temperature dependence of @xmath5 of smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 , which can not be explained by conventional ginzburg - landau theory , indicates a possible two gap scenario @xcite .",
    "note that other experiments such as recent resistivity measurements of the upper critical field on lafeaso@xmath100f@xmath101 @xcite and nmr studies of prfeaso@xmath100f@xmath101 @xcite also suggest that the novel class of fe - based oxypnictide superconductors exhibit two - band superconductivity .",
