    "for a compact set @xmath0 and a topological embedding @xmath5 , we shall say that @xmath1 is a _ topological contraction _ if @xmath6 consists of one point .",
    "we shall show that such a contraction can be very complicated when @xmath0 is a 3-dimensional handlebody .",
    "namely , we have the following result for which some more classical definitions will be recalled thereafter .",
    "+ we shall limit ourselves to @xmath7 , since the generalization will be clear .",
    "we recall that a 3-dimensional _ handlebody _ of genus 2 is diffeomorphic to the regular neighborhood @xmath8 in @xmath9 of the planar figure eight @xmath10 .",
    "a _ compression disk _ of @xmath8 is a smooth embedded disk in @xmath8 whose boundary lies in @xmath11 in which it is not homotopic to a point . among the compression disks are the _ meridian _",
    "disks @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a regular point in @xmath10 and @xmath14 is the regular neighborhood projection ( that is , a submersion over the smooth part of @xmath10 ) .",
    "a subset @xmath0 of @xmath15 is said to be _ essential _ in @xmath15 if it intersects every compression disk .",
    "+ a diffeomorphism @xmath1 of @xmath16 is a north - south diffeomorphism if it has two fixed points only , one source @xmath17 and one sink @xmath18 , every other orbit going from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "heegaard splitting _ of @xmath16 is made of an embedded surface dividing @xmath16 into two handlebodies . according to a famous theorem of f. waldhausen such a decomposition is unique up to diffeomorphism @xcite ( hence up to isotopy after cerf s theorem @xmath21 @xcite ) .",
    "it is not hard to prove that the phenomenon mentioned in theorem a does not happen with a heegaard splitting of genus 1 : if @xmath22 is a solid torus and @xmath1 is a topological contraction of @xmath22 , then there is a compression disk of @xmath22 avoiding @xmath23 .",
    "+ the example which we are going to construct for proving theorem a is based on the next theorem , for which some more notation is introduced . let @xmath24 be a simple closed curve .",
    "there exists a solid torus @xmath25 which contains @xmath8 and which is a tubular neighborhood of @xmath26 .",

    "we say that a simple curve is unknotted in @xmath22 if it bounds an embedded disk in @xmath22 .",
    "+   + theorem b looks very easy as it is simple to draw a simple curve which intuitively satisfies its conclusion .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that there are very few criteria for proving that a curve is essential in @xmath8 .",

    "the second author is grateful to sylvain gervais and nathan habegger for interesting conversations on link invariants , in particular on milnor s invariants @xcite .",
    "he is also grateful to the organizors of the conference in toulouse in memory of heiner zieschang ( _ braids , groups and manifolds _ , sept .",
    "2007 ) , who offered him the opportunity to give a short talk on that subject .",
    "our candidate for @xmath28 in theorem b is pictured in figure 1 .",

    "instead of proving that @xmath28 is essential in @xmath8 , we are going to prove a stronger result .",
    "clearly proposition 1 below implies theorem b. +   + we have the following description of @xmath30 : it is a 3-ball with a cantor set @xmath31 removed from its bounding 2-sphere properly embedded in the hyperbolic plane and take a 3-dimensional thickening of it . ] .",
    "this cantor set is the set of ends of @xmath30 .",
    "a simple curve in @xmath32 is not homotopic to zero if it divides @xmath31 into two non - empty parts .",
    "we get a fundamental domain @xmath33 for the action of @xmath34 on @xmath30 by cutting @xmath8 along two non - parallel meridian disks @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "here is a description of @xmath37 ( see figure 2 ) : @xmath33 is a 3-ball whose boundary consists of four disks @xmath38 and a punctured sphere @xmath39 .",
    "we have @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we have four strands in @xmath37 : @xmath42 and @xmath43 joining @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( resp .",
    "@xmath47 ) whose end points belong to @xmath48 ( resp .",
    "@xmath49 ) .",
    "moreover @xmath50 , @xmath51 , is linked with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , in the following sense : any embedded surface whose boundary is made of @xmath50 and a simple arc in @xmath54 intersects @xmath52 for @xmath53 ( the algebraic intersection number is 1 for some choice of orientations ) .",
    "figure 2    globally @xmath55 looks like an infinite borromean chain : any finite number of components is unlinked .",
    "suppose the contrary that @xmath55 is not essential and consider @xmath56 , a compression disk of @xmath30 avoiding @xmath55 .",
    "we take it to be transversal to @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 be the finite family of curves ( arcs or closed curves ) in @xmath59 .",
    "an element @xmath60 of @xmath58 is said to be _ innermost _ if @xmath60 divides @xmath56 into two domains , one of them being a disk @xmath61 whose interior contains no element of @xmath58 .",
    "take such an innermost element @xmath60 ; its associated disk @xmath61 lies in @xmath33 , up to a covering transformation , and divides @xmath33 into two balls @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "+   + let us consider the case when @xmath64 ; say that @xmath65 .",
    "the other cases are very similar .",
    "let @xmath66 .",
    "it is a simple arc dividing @xmath48 into two parts .",
    "both end points of @xmath46 lie in the same part since @xmath67 avoids @xmath46 .",
    "they are joined by a simple arc @xmath68 disjoint from @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 be an embedded disk bounded by @xmath71 .",
    "this disk can be chosen disjoint from @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath72 is not empty , this intersection being transversal , by looking at an innermost intersection curve on @xmath61 one finds an embedded 2-sphere @xmath73 in the complement of @xmath55 with one hemisphere in @xmath61 and the other in @xmath70 . as @xmath73 bounds a 3-ball @xmath74 in @xmath75 , which hence is also disjoint from @xmath55 , there is an isotopy supported in a neighborhood of @xmath74 whose effect on @xmath70 decreases the number of intersection curves with @xmath61 .",
    "once @xmath72 is empty , we have @xmath76 . but @xmath42 and @xmath43 must intersect @xmath70 .",
    "hence we have @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath78 . + one checks easily that there is an isotopy of @xmath56 , supported in a neighborhood of @xmath62 , till a new compression disk having fewer intersection curves with @xmath79 than the cardinality of @xmath58 . repeating this process",
    ", we push @xmath56 into a fundamental domain , say @xmath33 . in that position we have @xmath80 .",
    "again @xmath56 divides @xmath33 into two balls and one of them , @xmath62 , avoids @xmath55 .",
    "this proves that @xmath81 bounds a disk in @xmath82 , namely @xmath83 . hence @xmath56 is not a compression disk .",
    "+ we used local linking information ( namely , linking of strands in a fundamental domain of the universal covering space ) which , as in this example , follows from usual linking numbers and we got a global result .",
    "this method looks very efficient .",
    "the general criterion is the following , where we use the same notation as above .",
    "we recall the embedding @xmath84 . we start with a curve @xmath28 in @xmath8 which meets the conclusion of theorem b. we equip it with its 0-normal framing ( a section in this framing is not linked with @xmath28 in @xmath9 ) and we choose an embedding @xmath85 whose image is a tubular neighborhood of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath86 be a small ball in @xmath87 .",
    "as @xmath28 is unknotted in @xmath22 , there is an ambient isotopy , supported in @xmath87 , deforming @xmath88 to @xmath89 such that @xmath90 is a standard small solid torus in @xmath86 .",
    "one half of the desired heegaard splitting of genus 2 will be given by @xmath91 .",
    "at the present time @xmath1 is only defined on @xmath22 by @xmath92 .",
    "if we compose @xmath93 with a sufficiently strong contraction of @xmath86 into itself , then @xmath1 is a contraction in the metric sense .",
    "hence @xmath94 consists of one point . + choose a round ball @xmath95 containing @xmath22 in its interior . since @xmath96 is isotopic to the inclusion @xmath97 , @xmath1 extends as a diffeomorphism @xmath98 , and further as a diffeomorphism @xmath99 .",
    "we are free to choose @xmath100 as we like .",
    "if we compose @xmath101 with a strong contraction of @xmath102 , the intersection @xmath103 consists of one point .",
    "we now have a north - south diffeomorphism @xmath1 of @xmath16 which induces a topological contraction of @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath104 , @xmath1 also induces a topological contraction of @xmath15 .",
    "+ it remains to prove that @xmath105 is essential in @xmath15 .",
    "we know that @xmath106 is essential in @xmath15 . as a consequence ,",
    "any compression disk @xmath56 of @xmath15 crosses @xmath23",
    ". we can take @xmath56 to be transversal to @xmath107 such that no intersection curve is null - homotopic in @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath60 be an intersection curve which is _ innermost _ in @xmath56 and let @xmath61 be the disk that @xmath60 bounds in @xmath56 .",
    "+   + if not , we have @xmath108 and the simple curve @xmath60 in @xmath107 is unlinked with the core @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , up to isotopy in @xmath107 , it is a section of the 0-framing . in that case ,",
    "@xmath109 itself bounds an embedded disk in @xmath15 .",
    "this is impossible , as @xmath109 is essential in @xmath15 .",
    "+ therefore @xmath61 is a compression disk of the solid torus @xmath23 .",
