    "the stratified mukai flop is an algebro - geometric construction relating two birational varieties .",
    "there are three basic types of mukai flops ( a , d and e6;i / e6;ii ) named after the lie algebra to which they are related .",
    "namikawa coined these terms in @xcite where he showed that any two springer resolutions of a nilpotent orbit closure are connected by a series of such flops ( this result also appears in @xcite ) .",
    "there are also deformations of these mukai flops which we call atiyah flops .    the local model of a mukai flop of type a is a correspondence which relates the cotangent bundles @xmath0 and @xmath1 of grassmannians .",
    "these cotangent bundles are examples of springer resolutions of the closure of nilpotent orbits . in this case",
    "the orbit is that of a matrix @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the rank of @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "stratified flops also control the birational geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces . in @xcite markman",
    "examined brill - noether type stratifications of the moduli spaces of sheaves on a fixed k3 surface .",
    "he showed that two moduli spaces with mukai vectors related by certain involutions of the mukai lattice are related by stratified mukai flops .",
    "a basic question is when two birational varieties @xmath4 and @xmath6 have isomorphic derived categories of coherent sheaves @xmath7 and @xmath8 . if @xmath9 then we say that @xmath4 and @xmath6 are derived equivalent .",
    "one general conjecture implies that two varieties related by a stratified flop are derived equivalent .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be derived equivalent .",
    "constructing this equivalence is the motivating problem discussed in this paper .",
    "of course , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are actually isomorphic , but this isomorphism is not canonical . the derived equivalence described in section [ sec : equivlocmod ] is canonical in the sense that it also works in families .",

    ". these might not be isomorphic ( for the same reason @xmath10 and @xmath13 might not be isomorphic ) but , nevertheless , are derived equivalent .",

    "kawamata @xcite was also able to work out the case @xmath16 and @xmath17 and conjecture explicit equivalences when @xmath16 and @xmath18 .    to deal with arbitrary @xmath19 and @xmath20 we adopted a technique used by chuang and rouquier @xcite in modular representation theory .",

    "stratified flops also show up in the geometry of the affine grassmannian . more precisely , the twisted products @xmath30 and @xmath31 of orbits in the affine grassmannian of @xmath32 are related by stratified mukai flops ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "these braid group actions were used to construct homological knot invariants such as khovanov homology .",
    "this paper is , for the most part , a survey of topics related to flops , categorical lie algebra actions and derived equivalences .",

    "i began working in this area with the paper @xcite jointly written with joel kamnitzer .",
    "in it we give an algebro - geometric construction of khovanov knot homology .",
    "trying , at first somewhat unsuccessfully , to generalize this construction led us , over several years , in several tangential directions .",
    "i would like to thank joel for many years of truly fantastic ideas and insights which he shared with great enthusiasm and without which i am convinced none of this would have been possible .",

    "the cotangent bundles of @xmath818 can be described as @xmath819 where @xmath820 is a skew - symmetric matrix meaning that @xmath821 .",
    "now consider the map @xmath822 given by forgetting @xmath43 where @xmath823 .",
    "a general point @xmath824 has @xmath825 equal to @xmath20 or @xmath826 depending on whether @xmath20 is even or odd .",
    "this essentially comes down to the fact that a skew - symmetric matrix of size @xmath20 has rank at most @xmath826 if @xmath20 is odd but can have full rank if @xmath20 is even .",
    "so there are two cases to consider .",
    "if @xmath20 is even then @xmath827 has two components .",
    "two general points @xmath828 lie in the same component if and only if @xmath829 is even .",
    "then one component has a resolution given by @xmath830 and the other component has a resolution given by @xmath831 .",
    "if @xmath20 is odd then @xmath827 only has one component .",
    "a resolution of this component is the variety @xmath832 where @xmath820 and @xmath833 . on the other hand",
    ", there is a natural map from @xmath834 to ( [ eq:12 ] ) .",
    "this map is everywhere @xmath835 since the fibres are all isomorphic to @xmath836 using the restriction of @xmath434 to @xmath837 and @xmath836 is the disjoint union of two points .",
    "forgetting @xmath43 and @xmath838 we get a generically one - to - one map from ( [ eq:13 ] ) to the two connected components in @xmath839 .",
    "thus if @xmath20 is odd we get the following diagram ( in analogy with ( [ eq:10 ] ) ) @xmath840_{\\ip^- } & & t^ * { \\mathbb{ig}}(n,2n)^+ \\ar[dl]^{\\ip^+ } \\\\ & \\ib(n,2n ) & } \\ ] ] this is the local model for the stratified mukai flop of type @xmath809 where @xmath841 . we equip everything with the @xmath63-action acting on the fibres of @xmath842 just like in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "the type a grassmannian @xmath37 corresponds to the minuscule @xmath843 representation @xmath844 . in the case of @xmath845",
    "there are three minuscule representations .",
    "one of them corresponds to @xmath846 while the other two correspond to @xmath814 and @xmath815 .",
    "when @xmath20 is even the latter two respresentations are self dual but when @xmath20 is odd they are dual to each other .",
    "this is the representation theoretic manifestation of the dichotomy above .",
    "* example .",
    "* let us briefly examine @xmath847 and @xmath848 .",
    "we fix the bilinear form @xmath849 on @xmath810 and write a general element of @xmath850 as @xmath851 where @xmath852 are @xmath853 matrices .",
    "the condition that it be skew - symmetric translates into @xmath854 while the condition that it squares to zero is equivalent to @xmath855 now , if @xmath856 then the first condition implies that @xmath857 and @xmath858 and the second condition says @xmath859 so that @xmath847 consists of just a point .",
    "if @xmath60 then an elementary calculation ( which we omit ) shows that @xmath848 has two possible types of solutions .",
    "the first is of the form @xmath860 where @xmath861 is a @xmath862 matrix with @xmath863 ( i.e. a @xmath864-dimensional quadric cone ) .",
    "the second solution is of the form @xmath865 where @xmath866 .",
    "so @xmath848 is the union of two @xmath864-dimensional quadric cones which intersect only at their apex .",
    "fix @xmath841 from now on .",
    "the varieties @xmath842 have a natural filtration @xmath867 where @xmath868 corresponds to the locus where @xmath869 .",
    "as before , we denote the image of @xmath868 by @xmath870 .",
    "the subvariety @xmath871 consists of the locus where @xmath872 and hence is isomorphic to @xmath873 since @xmath225 can be recovered as @xmath874 .",
    "restricting @xmath434 to @xmath875 we find that @xmath876 is isotropic inside @xmath875 .",
    "thus the restriction of @xmath877 to @xmath871 is a @xmath878-fibration onto its image @xmath879 .    motivated by this structure",
    ", one can define a stratified mukai flop of type @xmath809 just like in the type a case .",
    "in other words , one has subvarieties @xmath880 and maps @xmath881 satisfying the same conditions as before .",
    "the difference is that @xmath10 is now a rank @xmath882 vector bundle equipped with a fibre - wise non - degenerate , symmetric bilinear form and @xmath883 is @xmath884 which is the relative isotropic grassmannian .",
    "once again we can consider the fibre product @xmath885 but , as before , we can not expect @xmath886 to induce an equivalence . on the other hand , @xmath887 is made up of @xmath888 components @xmath889 of dimension @xmath890 where @xmath891 inside @xmath892 .",
    "one can define open subvarieties @xmath893 by imposing the additional condition @xmath894 just as we did to define @xmath258 .",
    "it is not difficult to check that the open subvariety inside @xmath895 given by the condition @xmath896 is co - dimension one inside @xmath897 and @xmath898 .",
    "this is completely analogous to the situation in type a. so one should strongly expect an analogue of theorem [ thm : main3 ] .",
    "[ conj : main1 ] there exists a @xmath63-equivariant line bundles @xmath899 on @xmath900 such that @xmath901 induces an equivalence @xmath902 here @xmath254 and @xmath255 are the natural inclusions @xmath903    since the cohomology of @xmath811 is fairly different than that of @xmath37 it does not seem possible to construct a categorical @xmath21 action on cotangent bundles to isotropic grassmannians .",
    "nevertheless , one can imagine that some sort of action still exists .",
    "finally , note that @xmath842 also have natural one - parameter deformations , defined just like in the type a case .",
    "this leads to a stratified atiyah flop of type d. one can also conjecture and study derived equivalences in this case .",
    "there are also stratified flops of type e which show up naturally in the birational geometry of resolutions of nilpotent orbit closures .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite for a description of these .",
    "most questions mentioned above in the case of type d flops also remain valid for type e.",
    "* deformation quantization : * the category of @xmath904-modules on @xmath37 can be deformed to the category of coherent sheaves on @xmath0 . the specialization map from @xmath904-modules to coherent sheaves is given by taking the associated graded .",
    "now consider the open subset @xmath905 defined as the locus @xmath906 where @xmath290 .",
    "it turns out that the push - forward @xmath907 of the @xmath904-module @xmath908 is a @xmath904-module on @xmath909 which induces an equivalence @xmath910 . in @xcite",
    "we check that the associated kernel of this equivalence is actually the kernel @xmath911 .",
    "calculating the associated graded of a @xmath904-module is quite difficult in general . in @xcite",
    "we compute the associated graded by first constructing a categorical @xmath21 action on categories of @xmath904-modules on @xmath912 and then showing that it agrees , via the associated graded map , with the categorical @xmath21 action on coherent sheaves on @xmath913 .",
    "so this approach does not really give an entirely different proof that @xmath230 is invertible .",
    "the category of @xmath904-modules on @xmath37 is an example of a deformation quantization of the category of coherent sheaves on @xmath0 . but",
    "deformation quantizations also exists for category of coherent sheaves on quiver varieties , for instance .",
    "understanding how these categorical lie algebra actions and the corresponding equivalences deform to these deformation quantizations is a little explored but interesting problem .",
    "* flops as moduli spaces : * bridgeland @xcite describes a way to construct the atiyah flop @xmath762 of a 3-fold @xmath803 as the moduli of perverse coherent sheaves on @xmath6 ( the definition of these perverse sheaves uses the map @xmath42 ) .",
    "then the universal family over the product @xmath914 induces the derived equivalence @xmath804 .",
    "can you generalize this result to other atiyah or mukai flops ?",
    "this question seems difficult ( but also interesting ) in part because , as we saw in section [ sec : g(2,4 ) ] , the autoequivalence of @xmath915 is not induced by the structure sheaf of the natural fibre product ."
