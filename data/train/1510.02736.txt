    "quantum - state tomography ( qst ) is a standard tool used to characterize , validate , and verify the performance of quantum information processors .",
    "unfortunately , qst is a demanding experimental task , partly because the number of free parameters of an arbitrary quantum state scale quadratically with the dimension of the system . in most applications , however , the goal is not to manipulate arbitrary states , but to create and coherently evolve pure states . when the device is performing well , and there are only small errors , the quantum state produced will be close to a pure state , and the density matrix will have one a dominant eigenvalue .",
    "one can verify the system s performance with other techniques , e.g. randomized benchmarking  @xcite , to gain confidence that it is near this regime .",
    "this important prior information can be applied to significantly reduce the resources required for qst . in this work",
    "we address this problem by studying qst in the case that the measurement data arises from a density matrix with rank less than or equal to a given value ( bounded - rank qst ) .",
    "in particular , we study different aspects of informational completeness that allow for efficient estimation in this scenario , and robust estimation in the face of noise or when the state is full rank but close to a bounded - rank state .",
    "bounded - rank qst has been studied by a number of previous workers @xcite , and has been shown to require less resources than general qst .",
    "one approach is based on the compressed sensing methodology  @xcite , where certain sets of randomly chosen measurements guarantee a robust estimation of low - rank states with high probability .",
    "other schemes  @xcite , not related to compressed sensing , construct specific measurements ( povms ) that accomplish bounded - rank qst , and some of these protocols have been implemented experimentally  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some general properties of such measurements have been derived  @xcite .    in bounded - rank qst ( rank @xmath0 ) , two notions of informational completeness become relevant  @xcite : `` rank-@xmath1 complete '' and `` rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete . '' rank-@xmath1 complete measurements can distinguish a rank @xmath0 state from any other rank @xmath0 state , while rank-@xmath1 _ strictly - complete _ measurements can distinguish a rank @xmath0 state from any other physical state , of any rank .",
    "strictly - complete measurements are only possible due to the positive semidefinite property of the density matrix ( simply referred to throughout as  positivity \" ) for bounded - rank qst  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that strict - completeness has implications for estimating the state of system in the presence of noise . whereas the set of rank-@xmath1 states is nonconvex , with rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete measurements one can use convex optimization programs to estimate the state of the system  @xcite . under certain conditions",
    "@xcite , such programs allow for robust estimation of the quantum state .",
    "therefore , it is practically advantageous to use strictly - complete measurements for bounded - rank state estimation .",
    "currently , the literature lacks analytic tools to easily identify and design povms that are rank - r strictly - complete , since it is difficult in general to treat the positivity constraint .",
    "we address this problem here by developing new tools based on the concept of the schur complement .",
    "our method applies to povms whose outcomes algebraically determine a particular subset of matrix elements in the density matrix .",
    "we refer to such povms as `` element - probing '' povms ( ep - povms ) . for example , the measurements proposed by flammia  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and goyeneche  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for pure state tomography are ep - povms . in this context",
    ", the problem of qst translates to the problem of density matrix completion , where the goal is to recover the entire density matrix when only a few of its elements are given .",
    "the formalism we develop here entirely captures the underlying structure of ep - povms and solves the problem of bounded - rank density matrix completion . as such",
    ", it gives methods to test whether a given ep - povm is a rank-@xmath1 complete or strictly - complete , and thus it has applicability to high - fidelity bounded - rank qst .",
    "it also provides intuition on how to design measurement schemes for this task .",
    "based on this intuition , we construct two examples of rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povms . moreover , our analysis elucidates the role of the positivity constraint in quantum tomography .",
    "we will show how to apply the positivity constraint to determine whether an ep - povm is rank-@xmath1 strictly complete .",

    "so far , we have discussed the ideal noiseless case but in this section we will consider the affects of realistic noise on bounded - rank qst . we discuss two important sources : statistical noise in the measurements and preparation noise .",
    "statistical noise can come from finite sampling of the quantum system or other random fluctuations .",
    "preparation can come from inhomogenities in control or decoherence and causes the state being measured to not be represented by a bounded - rank density matrix .",

    ", we typically use numerical programs to obtain an estimation by minimizing a cost function under appropriate constraints .",
    "the cost function , for example , can be a distance measure between the measurement record and the model .",
    "the result would be a density matrix that estimates the measurement record , according to the cost function that we minimized .",
    "if the povm we use is rank-@xmath1 complete , there are potentially other higher - rank density matrices which produce similar data , but are very different than the ( bounded - rank ) state of the system .",
    "therefore , we must search for an estimate only within the set of rank-@xmath1 states . however , the set of rank-@xmath1 states is a nonconvex set and , therefore , it is difficult to find global optimum . hence , in practice it is difficult to reliably estimate bounded - rank quantum states by measuring rank-@xmath1 complete povms .    on the contrary , rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povms uniquely identify , in the absence of noise , a rank-@xmath1 state from within the set of _ all _ density matrices . since the set of density matrices is a convex set we can use convex programs to estimate the state .",
    "convex programs are appealing since they are efficient and converge to global optimum .",
    "moreover , it was recently shown  @xcite that the estimate returned by a convex program is robust to both sources of noise .",
    "the positivity constraint allows us to form rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povms , which in turn , enables us to treat the problem of bounded - rank qst as a convex problem and thereby estimate the state in a robust way .",
    "another implication of statistical noise is on the failure set of a given povm .",
    "as described above , this set correspond to states for which a principal submatrix @xmath88 used in the reconstruction is singular . without noise",
    ", this is a set of measure zero and is avoided with probability one .",

    "consider the povm in eq .   in the absence of statistical noise",
    ", its failure set corresponds to all states for which @xmath132 .",
    "if the statistical noise has fluctuations of the order of @xmath133 then every state within a finite ball @xmath134 can not be distinguished from a state with @xmath132 , and thus could not be identified by this povm  @xcite . while the povm in eq .   has a failure set with a simple structure , other povms may have failure sets that are more complex .",
    "the more complicated the structure , the less likely it is to affect the estimation of the state in the presence of statistical noise .",

    "the framework we developed in the previous sections allows us to construct rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povms .",
    "we present two such povms , and describe the algebraic reconstruction of the rank-@xmath1 state .",
    "the povms are generalization of the povms by flammia  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and goyeneche  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite from pure states to rank-@xmath1 states .",
    "the construction of these povms is made easier thanks to the tools presented in this work .",
    "additionally , these povms can be implemented iteratively , since the construction of rank-@xmath135 strictly - complete povm is nested in rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povm . therefore , suppose that it is _ a priori _ known that the state is nearly pure , then one could estimate it based on a rank-@xmath77 strictly - complete povm .",
    "if the estimate is not satisfactory , or if we wish to learn about the state beyond the rank-1 estimation , one can , e.g. , complement the rank-@xmath77 strictly - complete povm , into a rank-2 strictly - complete povm by a few additional measurements .",
    "a rank-@xmath1 density matrix has @xmath136 free parameters .",
    "the first rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povm we form has @xmath137 elements , and is a generalization of ther povm in eq .  .",

    "thus , this is an ep - povm which reconstruct the first @xmath1 rows and first @xmath1 columns of the density matrix .",
    "given the measured elements , we can write the density matrix in block form corresponding to measured and unmeasured elements , @xmath148 where @xmath48 is a @xmath49 submatrix and @xmath48 , @xmath149 , and @xmath51 are composed of measured elements",
    ". suppose that @xmath48 is nonsingular .",
    "given that @xmath150 , using the rank additivity property of schur complement and that @xmath151 , we obtain @xmath152 .",

    ", we will obtain the `` first - order '' correction for the estimate . in the same way",
    ", we can measure higher @xmath154 povms and obtain `` higher - order '' estimates of the state .",
    "the second rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povm we assemble corresponds to a measurement of @xmath160 orthonormal bases , which is a generalization of the four basis in eq .  .",
    "we consider the case that the dimension of the system is a power of two .",
    "since a measurement of @xmath161 mutually unbiased bases is informationally complete  @xcite ( can distinguish any quantum state from any other ) , this construction is relevant as long as @xmath162 .",
    "we first asses the case of @xmath163 , which is similar to the measurement proposed by goyeneche  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in this case",
    "there are five bases , the first is the computational basis , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and the other four are given in eq .  .",
    "goyeneche  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the last four bases are rank-1 complete . here , we show these five bases are rank-1 strictly - complete with the techniques introduced above .",
    "we label the upper - right diagonals @xmath166 to @xmath167 , where the @xmath166th diagonal is the principal diagonal and the @xmath168st diagonal is the upper right element . each diagonal , except the @xmath166th , has a corresponding hermitian conjugate diagonal ( its corresponding lower - left diagonal ) .",
    "thus , if we measure the elements on a diagonal , we also measure the elements of its hermitian conjugate .",
    "the computational basis corresponds to measuring the @xmath166th diagonal . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qst ] we showed measuring the last four bases corresponds to measuring the elements on the first diagonals . to show that the measurement of these five bases is rank-1 complete",
    ", we follow a similar strategy outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] .",
    "first , choose the leading @xmath169 principal submatrix , @xmath170 where , hereafter , the elements in bold font are the unmeasured elements . by applying a unitary transformation , which switches the first two rows and columns , we can move @xmath171 into the canonical form , @xmath172 from eq .",
    "we can solve for the bottom @xmath173 block of @xmath174 if @xmath175 .",
    "the set of states with @xmath176 corresponds to the failure set .",
    "note that the diagonal elements of the bottom @xmath173 block , @xmath59 and @xmath177 , are also measured .",
    "we repeat this procedure for the set of principal @xmath169 submatrices , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 for each @xmath181 , the upper - right and the lower - left corners elements @xmath182 and @xmath183 are unmeasured . using the same procedure as above we reconstruct these elements for all values of @xmath184 and thereby reconstruct the 2nd diagonals .",
    "we repeat the entire procedure again choosing a similar set of @xmath185 principal submatrices and reconstruct the 3rd diagonals and so on for the rest of the diagonals until all the unknown elements of the density matrix are reconstructed .",
    "since , we have reconstructed all diagonal elements of the density matrix and used the assumption that @xmath186 these five bases correspond to rank-@xmath77 complete povm . the first basis measures the 0th diagonal so by proposition  1 the measurement is rank-1 strictly - complete .",
    "the failure set corresponding to @xmath187 is when @xmath188 for @xmath189 .",
    "additionally , the five bases provide another set of submatrices @xmath190 to reconstruct @xmath5 .",
    "this set of submatrices results from also measuring the elements @xmath191 and @xmath192 , which were not used in the construction of @xmath187 .",
    "the failure set for @xmath190 is the same as the failure set of @xmath187 but since @xmath193 we gain additional robustness .",
    "when we consider both sets of submatrices the total failure set is @xmath188 and @xmath194 for @xmath189 and @xmath195 .",
    "this is the exact same set found by goyeneche  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we generalize these ideas to measure a rank-@xmath1 state by designing @xmath196 orthonormal bases that correspond to a rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povm . the algorithm for constructing these bases , for dimensions that are powers of two ,",
    "is given in algorithm  [ alg : rankr_gmb ] in the appendix .",
    "technically , the algorithm produces unique bases for @xmath197 but , as mentioned before , since @xmath161 mutually unbiased bases are informationally complete , for @xmath198 one may prefer to measure the latter .",
    "the corresponding measured elements are the first @xmath1 diagonals of the density matrix .",
    "given the first @xmath1 diagonals of the density matrix , we can reconstruct a state @xmath199 with a similar procedure as the one outlined for the five bases .",
    "first , choose the leading @xmath200 principle submatrix , @xmath171 .",
    "the unmeasured elements in this submatrix are @xmath201 and @xmath202 . by applying a unitary transformation we can bring @xmath171 into canonical form , and by using the rank condition from eq .",
    "we can solve for the unmeasured elements .",
    "we can repeat the procedure with the set of @xmath200 principle submatrices @xmath203 for for @xmath204 and @xmath205 from @xmath87 we can reconstruct the elements @xmath206 , which form the @xmath207st diagonal .",
    "we then repeat this procedure choosing the set of @xmath208 principle submatrices to reconstruct the @xmath209nd diagonal and so on until all diagonals have been reconstructed .",
    "this shows the measurements are rank-@xmath1 complete and by proposition  1 , since we also measure the computational bases , the povm is also rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete .",
    "the failure set corresponds to the set of states with singular @xmath49 principal submatrix @xmath210 for @xmath211 .",
    "this procedure also has robustness to this set since , as in the case of @xmath43 , there is an additional construction @xmath190 .",
    "the total failure set is then when @xmath88 is singular for @xmath204 and @xmath212 is singular for @xmath213 .",
    "if we are given a state that is close to pure , similarly to the povm of example  1 , we can iteratively create estimates of the state .",
    "the first five bases form a rank-@xmath77 strictly - complete measurement which gives most of the information about the state . measuring the next four bases",
    "forms a rank-@xmath214 strictly - complete which gives a first - order estimate of the state .",
    "we can repeat , measuring more series of four bases , to get higher - order estimates of the state .",
    "we have studied the problem of qst under the assumption that the state is pure and more generally has rank @xmath0 , for a permissible @xmath1 . with this prior information",
    ", we can design special measurements that are more efficient than measurements for a general quantum state , that is , povms with less than @xmath14 elements .",
    "there are two notions of completeness for these measurements : rank-@xmath1 complete and rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete .",
    "rank-@xmath1 complete measurements uniquely identify states within the set of rank @xmath0 states while rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete measurements uniquely identify states within the set of all physical states , of any rank .",
    "the latter type of measurements are only possible due to the positivity property of the density matrix .",
    "strict - completeness has a practical implication for estimating the state of system in the presence of noise .",
    "although the set of rank-@xmath1 states is nonconvex , using rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povms we are able to use convex optimization programs to estimate the state of the system .",
    "such programs ensure robust estimation of the quantum state .",
    "generally , it is difficult to asses if an arbitrary povm satisfies one of these completeness relations . in this work we studied povms that allow for the reconstruction of a few density matrix elements , ep - povms . in this situation",
    "the problem of qst is reduced to density matrix completion .",
    "we developed tools to determine if a given ep - povm is rank-@xmath1 complete or rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete based on properties of the schur complement .",
    "these tools provide a unified framework for all ep - povms .",
    "we applied them to previous constructions of povms by flammia  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and by goyeneche  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and showed that they are rank-1 strictly - complete povm .",
    "the framework also allow us to construct new rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete ep - povms and we constructed two examples .",
    "one could use rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povms , such as the ones presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] , to iteratively probe highly - pure quantum states .",
    "a rank-@xmath77 strictly - complete povm could be used to produce an estimate of the dominant eigenvalue , as was shown by goyeneche  _ et al . _",
    "we can use our generalization for rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povms to produce more accurate estimates , when needed .",
    "for example , a rank-@xmath214 strictly - complete povm , such as the ones introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] , would produce an estimate corresponding to the state s two largest eigenvalues .",
    "we could continue to produce more accurate estimates but at some point the eigenvalues will be so small that other sources of noise will dominate . in future work",
    "we plan to explore how one can use such an iterative procedure to certify the number of dominant eigenvalues in the state without performing full quantum tomography .",
    "this work provides a full understanding of element - probing measurements but these are only a subset of all possible measurements .",
    "there are non ep - povms that are rank-@xmath1 complete and rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete but our framework can not be applied to them .",
    "this general case will be studied in subsequent work as well as the relation of this approach to compressed sensing techniques  @xcite .",
    "we focused here exclusively on qst and implicitly assumed that the povms are implemented perfectly .",
    "however , any experimental implementation of povms would be imperfect and thus the tomographic measurement record will be polluted by noise due to such imperfections .",
    "this motivates the necessity of self - consistent tomography procedure that includes quantum - process tomography and quantum - detector tomography .",
    "these important issues will be studied elsewhere .",
