    "in light of the remarkable achievement of bose - einstein condensation in 1995 @xcite , there has been a growing application of ideas from quantum optics to matter waves .",
    "this new field of atom optics @xcite has included both theoretical and experimental investigations of matter wave coherence @xcite , atom lasers @xcite , non - linear effects in matter waves including matter wave mixing @xcite , parametric amplification and squeezing in coupled optical and matter waves @xcite .",
    "however the extension of these ideas to degenerate fermi gases has proven difficult because of the pauli exclusion principle , which prohibits one from developing simple theoretical models based on only a few normal modes of the schrdinger field .",
    "in addition to this , fermi fields do not possess a classical limit analogous to the coherent state for bose fields thereby making it impossible to develop semiclassical mean - field theories such as the gross - pitaevskii equation for bose fields .",
    "all in all , the physical intuition obtained from quantum optics can not be directly applied to theoretical investigations of fermions .",
    "it therefore seems necessary that in order to make progress in the theory of fermionic atom optics , fundamental model systems in quantum optics need to be reanalyzed from first principles .",
    "recent work in this direction indicates that four - wave mixing and coherent amplification of matter waves can occur in fermionic systems as a result of cooperative many - particle quantum interference analogous to dicke superradiance @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider another model system , the atomic analog of an optical cavity with two partially transmittive mirrors .",
    "a schematic of our system is illustrated in fig .",
    "it consists of an atom cavity formed by two potential barriers with a finite number of bound states .",
    "the cavity states are coupled to a continuum of free particle states on either side of the cavity via tunnelling through the barriers .",
    "our goal is to develop an input - output theory for fermions in the atom cavity that allows one to calculate the field radiated out of the cavity in terms of the field incident on the cavity .",
    "the input - output theory for a single mode of a lossy optical cavity was developed by collett and gardiner in the form of quantum langevin equations for the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "the great utility of this theory is that it allows one to incorporate the effects of quantum noise on the output field transmitted by the cavity as well as in the intracavity dynamics .",
    "collett and gardiner s formalism has been extended to bosonic matter fields in order to model the output coupling of atoms from a bose - einstein condensate in a single mode of an atom trap @xcite .",
    "as we will show below , the necessity of treating all modes of the atom cavity for fermions leads to novel features not present in the single mode bosonic theories .",
    "most significantly , the eigenstates of the cavity become coupled due to their mutual interaction with the same external continuum states .",
    "secondly , the coupling of the reservoir modes to all cavity modes leads to the creation of coherences between fermions occupying different single particle modes in the radiated field even if the incident field is completely incoherent .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we present our physical model for an atom cavity coupled to a continuum of reservoir states . in section iii , we derive a set of quantum langevin equations for the fermionic annihilation and creation operators of the eigenstates of the cavity in terms of both the input and output fields .",
    "these results are generalized to a two sided cavity in section iv . in section",
    "v , we consider a constant current of fermions incident on one side of the atom cavity and calculate the steady state statistics of the fermions transmitted through the other side of the cavity . in appendix",
    "a , we show that in a manner similar to the bosonic case , the presence of noise operators in the langevin equations is necessary to preserve the anticommutation relations for the fermion operators . in appendix",
    "b we derive explicit forms for the coupling constants , which connect the intracavity modes to external continuum modes via a tunnelling hamiltonian .",
    "a physical schematic of our system is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to one spatial dimension , which allows space to be divided up into five distinct regions .",
    "the region @xmath0 between the two potential barriers of height @xmath1 represents the atom cavity . for thick barriers ,",
    "the number of bound states of the cavity , @xmath2 , is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of the atoms @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the case where @xmath5 .",
    "the regions @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the left and right reservoirs , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is the length of the reservoir region .",
    "we let it go to infinity so that the fermions are described in terms of a continuum of free particle plane wave states .",
    "atoms located in the reservoir regions with energies less the @xmath1 couple to the cavity states by tunnelling through the potential barriers located at @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "since the wave functions for atoms with energies greater than @xmath1 are not spatially localized in either the cavity or the reservoir regions , we restrict ourselves to single particle states with energies less than @xmath1 . in this case",
    "we can meaningfully speak of left / right reservoir states and cavity states since the single particle wave functions decay exponentially inside the potential barriers .",
    "such a restriction is valid provided the initial state does not contain any occupied states with energies greater than @xmath11 and two - body collisional interactions between atoms , which can cause atoms to be scattered into higher energy states , are negligible",
    ". the latter condition will indeed be satisfied for ultra - cold spin polarized fermions since @xmath12-wave collisions are forbidden and @xmath13-wave collisions are negligible at these temperatures . under these conditions , the states with energies larger than @xmath11 are not coupled to states with energies less than @xmath11 .",
    "the second quantized hamiltonian for the cavity - reservoir system in the subspace of states with energies below the barrier is @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the free hamiltonians for the system ( i. e. the atom cavity ) and the left and right reservoir states , respectively , @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is a fermionic annihilation operator that destroys an atom in the cavity with wave function @xmath20 and energy @xmath21 . similarly , @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 are fermionic annihilation operators that destroy an atom in the left and right reservoirs , respectively , with the wave function @xmath24 and energy @xmath25 in the regions outside the barrier .",
    "the coupling between the system and the reservoirs , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , is given by effective tunnelling hamiltonians @xcite @xmath28 \\\\ h_{sr}=i\\hbar\\sum_{n , k}\\left[\\tilde{\\kappa}_{n , k}c^{\\dagger}_n b_k - \\tilde{\\kappa}_{n , k}^{*}b^{\\dagger}_k c_n \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in all cases the summation is restricted to those states with energies below the barrier .",
    "explicit expressions for the tunnelling matrix elements , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are given in appendix b. we note here that in 1-d , the coupling constants depend only on the magnitude of @xmath31 and not its sign .",
    "in contrast to quantum optical systems , which are often approximated as a single cavity mode with a large occupation number , a full multi - mode treatment is required for fermions even if the number of fermions in the cavity is small ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is because of the pauli principle , which forbids more than one atom from occupying the same cavity state , and thereby prevents one from singling out a particular state as being more important than the rest .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that the general results presented below do not depend on the precise nature of our physical model .",
    "we use a stepwise constant potential because it leads to simple analytic results for the coupling between the reservoirs and cavity states . our model system in eq .",
    "( [ htot ] ) could be applied to any fermion system in which a finite number of discrete states are linearly coupled to a dense continuum of states .",
    "we now derive a set of integro - differential equations of motion for the cavity operators that only involve the initial or final state of the reservoir operators .",
    "we proceed by formally integrating the equations of motion for the reservoir operators and substituting these back into the equations for the cavity operators . in this section ,",
    "we set @xmath33 so that the atom cavity is coupled to a single reservoir .",
    "this is analogous to an optical cavity with a single partially transmittive mirror .",
    "the inclusion of the right reservoir is summarized in the following section .",
    "it is convenient to work with slowly varying operators in the interaction representation , @xmath34 by formally integrating the heisenberg equations of motion for @xmath35 from the initial time @xmath36 to @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the operators for the input field incident on the cavity barrier , and substituting this solution into the equations of motion for @xmath40 , we obtain    @xmath41    here , @xmath42 is a reservoir correlation function , @xmath43 that decays to zero in a characteristic time @xmath44 due to the destructive interference between the different oscillations . note that @xmath44 depends , in general , on the cavity states @xmath45 and @xmath4 that are coupled by @xmath42 , and @xmath46 is on the order of the bandwidth of the reservoir , @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that @xmath48 only changes significantly over a time scale @xmath49 , then we can make the markov approximation by setting @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ lang1 ] ) . for time",
    "intervals @xmath51 , we can then make the replacement @xmath52 where the later expression is given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 these expressions are defined in the continuum limit that @xmath56 .",
    "the markov approximation assumes that the correlation function decays very rapidly , which requires that @xmath29 vary slowly with @xmath31 .",
    "2 , shows the correlation function @xmath57 for the highest energy bound state in the potential well .",
    "this state has the longest correlation time since the @xmath58 are the largest for this state and because the summation over reservoir states is restricted to states with energies less than @xmath11 .",
    "for the three cases plotted in fig .",
    "2 , the smallest value of @xmath59 among all the cavity states is @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . in each case",
    "we see that the correlation function goes to zero in a time much shorter than @xmath66 .",
    "this shows that the markov approximation is a very good approximation for our system with @xmath67 .     for @xmath68 and @xmath61(solid line )",

    "@xmath11 and @xmath72 were chosen so that the cavity contains @xmath73 bound states . ]    by combining the above results , we obtain a quantum langevin equation for each of the cavity modes , @xmath74    in eq .",
    "( [ lang_in ] ) , we have defined the _ input noise operator _ @xmath75 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the annihilation operator for mode @xmath78 of the input fermi field at time @xmath37 , and the total input field operator is therefore @xmath79 that is , @xmath80 is the free fermi field that propagates from the initial time @xmath36 to @xmath37 in the heisenberg picture .    since the initial reservoir operators obey the anticommutation relations @xmath81 and @xmath82 , it is easy to show that the noise operators obey the anticommutation relations , @xmath83 furthermore , if we restrict ourselves to time scales much longer than the correlation time @xmath44 , then we can approximate the correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ acn_in ] ) by a delta function times the area under @xmath42 , so that @xmath84    before proceeding , there are several features of eq . ( [ lang_in ] ) that are worth mentioning .",
    "first , the dissipative term @xmath85 gives a damping term plus an energy shift for @xmath86 while for @xmath87 there is a non - zero coupling between cavity states .",
    "the coupling between cavity states is a result of all states coupling to the same reservoir , which leads to an indirect coupling between cavity states .",
    "second , the noise operators couple all of the reservoir states to each of the cavity states .",
    "moreover , the noise operators are different for each cavity state due to the @xmath45-dependence of the coupling constants .    instead of solving for the reservoir operators in terms of the initial time @xmath36 , one can instead solve for @xmath35 in terms of a final time @xmath88 , @xmath89 the operators @xmath90 represent the modes of the output field that contain the field radiated by the cavity at earlier times . by substituting this expression into the equations of motion for @xmath40 , making the markov approximation in the integrand , and transforming back to the heisenberg representation one",
    "obtains @xmath91 here , @xmath92 is the _ output field noise operator _ for state @xmath45 , @xmath93 where we have defined the output field annihilation operator @xmath94 for the mode @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath94 are related to the output field of the reservoir by , @xmath95 it is clear that @xmath96 represents the free fermi field for the reservoir that propagates from @xmath37 to the final time @xmath97 .",
    "it is easy to see that if the @xmath98 obey normal fermionic anticommutation relations , then the anticommutators for the output noise operators are the same as eqs .",
    "( [ acn_in]-[acn_in2 ] ) .",
    "the boundary condition for the barrier separating the cavity from the reservoir is obtained by subtracting eq .",
    "( [ lang_in ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ lang_out ] ) , @xmath99 equation ( [ bc ] ) relates the noise operator for the output field to the input noise operator reflected by the barrier and the field radiated by the cavity .",
    "it is of the same form as the boundary condition for an optical cavity @xcite except that in our case there are separate noise operators for each cavity modes since we can not , in general , assume that the coupling constants are independent of the cavity state . in appendix a , we use eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) and ( [ lang_in ] ) to derive the anticommutation relations between the cavity operators and the noise operators at arbitrary times .",
    "equation ( [ bc ] ) is not very useful since it is the mode operators of the output field , @xmath100 , that are needed to calculate properties of the output field such as mode occupation statistics , current density , etc .",
    "therefore , we must extract from eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) a boundary condition for the annihilation operators of the modes of the input and output fields .",
    "first we note that in the limit of an infinite potential barrier the system - reservoir coupling vanishes , @xmath101 . in this limit , a fermion incident from the left is perfectly reflected by the barrier . since @xmath80 and @xmath96 are the free schrdinger fields that propagate forward in time from @xmath102 to @xmath37 and from @xmath37 to @xmath103 , respectively , it follows that @xmath104 the total field is the incident plus reflected fields , @xmath105 it follows from ( [ inoutbc ] ) and ( [ total ] ) that @xmath106 and that the eigenmodes of the reservoir are standing waves for @xmath107 .",
    "note that ( [ inoutbc ] ) and ( [ total ] ) are second quantized versions of the relations for the incident and reflected wave functions from an infinite potential barrier @xcite .    for the reservoir , the displacement operator is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the momentum operator for the reservoir @xcite . multiplying ( [ bc ] ) by @xmath110 on the left and @xmath111 on the right gives after some manipulation @xcite , @xmath112 multiplying eq .",

    "( [ bcmode ] ) says that the difference between the mode of the output field propagating away from the barrier with momentum @xmath116 is the input field with momentum @xmath117 reflected by the barrier plus the field radiated by the cavity .",
    "furthermore , only those states of the cavity that have the same energy as the reservoir mode can radiate into that mode .",

    "we illustrate how to utilize these results for a particular initial state of the cavity plus reservoirs .",
    "specifically , we assume that the atom cavity initially contains no atoms and that the right reservoir is likewise in the vacuum state .",

    "this is analogous to the optical case where an incoherent white light source is used to drive an optical cavity .    even though @xmath138 is a state with a fixed number of atoms , it acts like a constant input flux of fermions on the cavity",
    "this is because of the implicit use of the born approximation in the derivation of the langevin equations , i. e. the reservoir is assumed to be so large that the back - action of the system is negligible .    using the results of the previous section",
    "we can calculate how the state of the left and right reservoirs are modified due to their coupling to the cavity .",
    "in particular , we focus on the occupation numbers @xmath140 as well as the current density operators for the reservoirs @xmath141 where @xmath142 are the spatial fourier components of the current .",
    "note that @xmath143 is the average momentum in the output fields",
    ".    equation ( [ lang_in2 ] ) for @xmath144 can be numerically integrated but we note that because of the exponential dependence of the reservoir - cavity coupling constants on the barrier height and thickness , the off - diagonal coupling is much smaller than the energy difference between the cavity modes , @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "in fact , a numerical evaluation of @xmath147 and @xmath148 using the coupling constants of appendix b indicate that these terms are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the energies of the cavity modes .",
    "it is therefore an excellent approximation to neglect all off - diagonal terms in the equations of motion .",
    "furthermore , we can perform a renormalization of the cavity mode energies by absorbing the radiative energy shifts into them , @xmath149 .    for times much longer than the lifetimes of the cavity modes , @xmath150 , the system reaches a steady state with the solution , @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",

    "( [ cout1 ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) , one obtains @xmath213 while using eq .",
    "( [ cin1 ] ) along with ( [ bc ] ) gives , @xmath214 for @xmath210 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) that the equal time anticommutators can be written as @xmath215 .",
    "the operator @xmath216 is determined from the equations of motion , ( [ lang_in ] ) and ( [ lang_out ] ) , to be @xmath217 .",
    "if we define the step function @xmath218 as @xmath219 then the anticommutators for arbitrary @xmath220 are given by    @xmath221    finally , we show that eq .",
    "( [ lang_in ] ) preserve the equal time anticommutators for the system operators . since ( [ lang_in ] ) constitute an @xmath222 system of equations , an explicit solution will be non - trivial for @xmath223 .",
    "however , it is already apparent that @xmath224 since , as we stated before , @xmath144 can be expressed in terms of the initial states for the operators at @xmath36 and @xmath225 .",
    "we are therefore left with showing that @xmath226 . calculating the derivative of the anticommutator using ( [ lang_in ] ) and ( [ in_anti ] ) ,",
    "one obtains , @xmath227 integrating this expression and using the initial condition , @xmath228 , we obtain the desired result .",
    "in this appendix we derive explicit expressions for the tunnelling coupling constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "tunnelling in many - body systems was first treated by bardeen @xcite and later elaborated on by prange @xcite and harrison @xcite in the context of electron tunnelling across insulator junctions .",
    "bardeen showed that if there exists a potential barrier separating two regions of space , then the tunnelling matrix element , @xmath229 , for the tunnelling of a particle from state @xmath230 on one side of the barrier into the state @xmath231 on the opposite side of the barrier is given by the off - diagonal current density in the barrier , @xmath232_{x = x_1}. \\label{tt}\\ ] ] here @xmath233 is a point inside the barrier and @xmath231 and @xmath230 are the continuations of the single particle wave functions into the barrier where they decay exponentially .",
    "@xmath229 is independent of the choice of @xmath233 provided the energy difference between the two states @xmath234 and @xmath235 is much less than the height of the barrier .",
    "the relationship between ( [ tt ] ) and the overlap of the hamiltonian between states localized on either side of the barrier is discussed in @xcite .      for the purpose of calculating the coupling constants , we take the @xmath20 to be the eigenstates of the finite potential well corresponding to @xmath241 . in the classically allowed region , @xmath0",
    ", @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath242 for @xmath45 even and @xmath243 for @xmath45 odd while inside the barrier @xmath244 .",
    "the cavity wave numbers @xmath245 are determined by the solutions to @xmath246 for @xmath45 even and @xmath247 for @xmath45 odd @xcite .        an interesting consequence of eqs . ( [ coupleeven ] ) and ( [ coupleodd ] )",
    "is that if @xmath45 is even and @xmath4 is odd or vice versa , then @xmath254 on the other hand if @xmath45 and @xmath4 are both even or both odd , then @xmath255 since @xmath256 is an eigenstate of the parity operator with parity @xmath257 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ lang_in2 ] ) that for a two - sided cavity only states of the same parity are coupled .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the our model system in fig .",
    "1 being invariant under spatial reflections , which implies that even when the coupling of the cavity states to the reservoirs is taken into account , parity will still be a good quantum number for the cavity states .",
    "no such result holds for the single - sided cavity since the cavity plus reservoir system is no longer invariant with respect to reflections .",
    "finally we note that the approximation @xmath258 used in deriving @xmath29 becomes exact for the evaluation of the @xmath259 and the cavity boundary conditions ( [ bcmode ] ) and ( [ bcmode2 ] ) since in these expression @xmath29 is always multiplied by @xmath260 .",
