    "although the static and dynamic properties of a single polaron have been @xcite ( and still are @xcite ) extensively studied , the properties of an interacting polaron system , e.g. their optical absorption @xcite , are less well understood . thus far , the many - polaron system has been studied mainly in the hartree - fock approximation and in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , even though in ref . @xcite it was shown that in three dimensions ( 3d ) the polaron energy and effective mass are influenced by screening effects beyond rpa . in this paper",
    ", we investigate dynamical exchange effects in both static properties ( energy and effective mass ) and response properties ( optical absorption ) of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) polaron system .",
    "however , although our formalism is appropriate for the description of an interacting electron ( or polaron ) gas , it does not allow to investigate the 2d wigner solid phase formed for example by electrons on a helium surface .",
    "also the study of the many small - polaron gas and bipolarons in quasi-2d systems such as the copper oxide planes in high - t@xmath0 cuprate superconductors ewardsmottalexandrov , alexandrovprcuprates , alexandrovtcbipolarons , alexandrovbook lies beyond the scope of our approach in its current form .",
    "a convenient formalism to take into account many - body effects in the polaron system relies on containing these effects in the structure factor lemmenspss82 .",
    "this approach , reminiscent of the feynman - bijl treatment of superfluid helium-4 , was first developed to calculate the ground state energy of a many - polaron system @xcite , and has later been applied to the optical absorption of this system @xcite .",
    "the 2d dynamic structure factor can be written as @xmath1with @xmath2 the fourier transform of the bare coulomb interaction in 2d , @xmath3 the surface density of charge carriers , @xmath4 the dielectric constant at high frequency , and @xmath5 the dielectric function of the system of charge carriers .",
    "previous work lemmenspss82,wuprb34,deganiprb35,jalabertprb40,tempereprb64 relied on the rpa dielectric function : @xmath6where @xmath7 is the 2d lindhard polarizability and is known in closed form @xcite . a more accurate result for the dielectric function",
    "is obtained by introducing the frequency dependent local field correction @xmath8@xmath9 in the 3d case , the local field correction was derived in the framework of the dynamical exchange decoupling ( ded ) method @xcite .",
    "this method , based on the time - dependent hartree - fock formalism , was recently extended to the 2d case in refs .",
    "this leads to an improved dielectric function , @xmath10 , that can be used to include dynamical exchange effects in the analysis of the many - polaron system .",
    "the ded result for the dielectric function is markedly different from the results obtained in the rpa formalism , hubbard s formalism @xcite and the formalism of singwi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in 3d",
    "these different approaches can be compared to experiment : measurements of the dynamic local field correction by larson and co - workers @xcite have shown that the 3d ded approach @xcite leads to superior results .    in this work , we use the ded dielectric function in combination with the formalism describing the many - body effects in a polaron system through the structure factor . in section",
    "ii , we investigate the dynamical exchange effects on the optical absorption of the many - polaron system . from the optical conductivity",
    "the effective mass of the polaron as a function of the density is derived through a sum - rule in section iii . finally , in section iv , the ground state energy of the interacting polaron system is calculated beyond  rpa .",
    "as we shall show , including dynamical exchange effects leads to non - negligible corrections to all these quantities .",
    "the optical absorption of an interacting system of frhlich polarons in the weak - coupling regime was investigated in @xcite .",

    ", the effect of electron - electron interactions on the _ optical absorption _ of a many - polaron gas has been investigated only in the framework of rpa wuprb34,tempereprb64,iadonisiepjb12 .",
    "nevertheless , expression ( opticon ) is not restricted to the rpa approximation : any form of the dynamic structure factor can be introduced in the integrand . here , we will use the results obtained for the dielectric function in the ded formalism @xcite instead .    using expression ( [ strucfac ] ) and the ded result for the dielectric function , we can rewrite ( [ opticon ] ) as@xmath17 = -\\alpha   % tcimacro{\\dfrac{{\\cal n}}{(\\nu /\\nu _ { lo})^{3}}}% % beginexpansion { \\displaystyle{{\\cal n } \\over ( \\nu /\\nu _ { lo})^{3}}}% % endexpansion % tcimacro{\\dint}% % beginexpansion \\displaystyle\\int % % endexpansion \\limits_{0}^{\\infty } dk\\text { } k^{3}% % tcimacro{\\func{im}}% % beginexpansion \\mathop{\\rm im}% % endexpansion \\left (   % tcimacro { % \\dfrac{1}{\\varepsilon _ { \\text{ded}}\\left ( k,\\nu -\\nu _ { \\text{lo}}\\right ) } } % % beginexpansion { \\displaystyle{1 \\over \\varepsilon _ { \\text{ded}}\\left ( k,\\nu -\\nu _ { \\text{lo}}\\right ) } } % % endexpansion \\right ) ,   \\label{opticon2}\\]]where now @xmath18 and @xmath19 are dimensionless wave numbers and frequencies based on the fermi wave vector @xmath20 and the fermi energy @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "the plasmon branch @xmath29 lies close to the edge of the landau continuum , @xmath37 .",
    "figure 1 compares the plasmon dispersion in the ded approach to the dispersion in the rpa approach for several values of @xmath38 . for small @xmath39 values",
    "the plasmon frequency in ded is lower than in rpa .",
    "furthermore , in ded longer wave length plasmons are present .",
    "the oscillator strength @xmath31 of the plasmon branch can be obtained straightforwardly using the @xmath40-sum rule .",
    "if we substitute ( [ splitup ] ) in the @xmath40-sum rule , @xmath41we can find an expression for the oscillator strength of the plasmon branch : @xmath42where @xmath43is the first frequency moment of the landau continuum contribution only . in figure 2",
    ", we compare the oscillator strength of the plasmon branch in rpa and ded for several values of @xmath38 . at small @xmath39 the difference between",
    "the strength of the plasmons in rpa and ded is negligible .",
    "as @xmath39 increases , a difference appears : the maximum oscillator strength for the plasmon branch in ded is reached at a smaller wave vector .",
    "compared to rpa , the oscillator strength of the ded plasmons shows a long tail as a function of @xmath39 .    in figure 3 the optical absorption due to the plasmon contribution",
    "is shown for several relevant values of the density @xmath3 of a two dimensional polaron gas , using the material parameters for gaas ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xmath46 , @xmath47 mev , @xmath48 nm ) .",
    "the presence of the shorter wave length plasmons in ded as compared to rpa shifts the spectral weight to higher frequencies .",
    "nevertheless , both in rpa and ded the contribution of plasmons to the optical absorption of the many - polaron gas is small in comparison with the contribution of the single - particle excitations .",
    "the total optical absorption is shown in figure 4 , again for different surface densities of polarons in gaas .",
    "although the landau continuum occupies the same region of the @xmath49-plane in the ded and rpa approaches , the spectral weight of the structure factor is distributed differently . as can be seen in figure 4",
    ", this leads to a measurable difference between the ded and rpa results . comparing both the ded and rpa optical absorption with the single - polaron absorption @xcite",
    ", we find that the rpa result overestimates the damping due to many - body effects .",
    "from figure 4 , it is clear that the spectral weight of the optical absorption in the region beyond the single - phonon gap @xmath50 is different for each of the approaches ( ded , rpa and single - polaron ) .",
    "this may seem surprising at first glance , since the @xmath40-sum rule imposes that the total spectral weight is a constant : @xmath51d\\omega = \\frac{\\pi ne^{2}}{2m_{b}}.\\]]it is important to keep in mind that the optical absorption of the polaron system shows a delta - function in the origin ( @xmath52 ) , not shown in figure 4 .",
    "the total spectral weight is distributed between this delta - function peak and the optical absorption spectrum beyond the single - phonon gap @xcite .",
    "the spectral weight of the delta - function is related to the polaron effective mass @xmath53 in such a way that @xcite @xmath54d\\omega = \\frac{\\pi ne^{2}}{2m_{b}}\\left ( 1-\\frac{m_{b}}{% m^{\\ast } } \\right ) .",
    "\\label{sumrule}\\]]thus , a change in the spectral weight allotted to the @xmath55 region of the optical conductivity indicates a change in the effective mass of the polarons .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling increases the effective mass of a single polaron by @xmath56 .",
    "the well - known single - polaron result for this effective mass increase in 2d is @xmath57 . in figure 5 , we show the effective mass increase @xmath58 as a function of the surface density of polarons in gaas . both the rpa result ( dashed curve , cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the ded result ( full curve ) approach the one - polaron result in the limit of small density . as the surface density of polarons increases , @xmath59 decreases , more rapidly in rpa than in ded .    the fractional change @xmath60 is shown in the inset of figure 5 , and indicates that there is roughly a 15% difference between the effective mass increase predicted by ded and that predicted by rpa",
    "this is consistent with the increase in spectral weight of the optical absorption at @xmath61 in ded as compared to rpa : if less spectral weight is present in the region @xmath62 , the delta - function in the origin must carry more spectral weight , indicating an increase in effective mass .",
    "a general expression for the ground state energy per particle of an interacting polaron gas at weak coupling was derived in ref .",
    "lemmenspss82 : @xmath63 in this expression @xmath64 is the energy contribution per particle of the system of charge carriers , without electron - phonon coupling , and the second term is the polaron contribution .",
    "the 2d frhlich interaction amplitude appearing in this expression is@xmath65with @xmath66 the surface of the 2d system .",
    "whereas the optical conductivity depends on the dynamic structure factor , the ground state energy depends on the static structure factor@xmath67expressed in dimensionless variables for the wave number and the frequency , this is@xmath68a comparison between the static structure factor in rpa and ded is shown in figure 6 .",
    "around @xmath69 the ded static structure factor shows a transition to the long wave length behavior @xcite .",
    "the shift in ground state energy per particle due to the electron - phonon coupling @xmath70 is given by lemmenspss82 : @xmath71^{2}}{% s_{\\text{2d}}(k)+\\gamma ^{2}k^{2}}.\\]]with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the result for the polaronic shift in the ground state energy per particle , as a function of the wigner - seitz radius @xmath38 , is shown in figure 7 for different approaches .",
    "the material parameters for gaas were used for this figure . if no many - body effects are taken into account",
    ", the 2d polaronic energy per particle is @xmath74 in the weak coupling regime .",
    "if many - body effects are taken into account on the level of the hartree - fock approximation , we get a monotonous decreasing energy as @xmath75 increases , while the rpa approximation leads to a minimum in the polaronic energy at @xmath76 , with @xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "we find that including dynamical exchange effects lowers @xmath79 with respect to rpa , and shifts the energy minimum to slightly lower density : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "so , using an improved dielectric function as compared to rpa leads to a change of ca .",
    "10 % in the ground state energy .",
    "efforts to describe many - body effects in the polaron system have thus far relied strongly on the rpa approach lemmenspss82,wuprb34,deganiprb35,jalabertprb40,iadonisiepjb12,tempereprb64 , even though there have been indications that inclusion of a _ static _ local field correction modifies the ground state energy and the effective mass of the polarons @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use a dielectric function that includes a _ frequency - dependent _ local field correction derived in the time - dependent hartree - fock formalism brosenspss74,hameeuwssc126,hameeuwepjb35 .",
    "we find that taking into account dynamical exchange effects reveals important corrections at weak coupling to the optical absorption of the polaron system , the effective mass of the polarons and the ground state energy of the polaron system . in gaas , estimates of the effective mass based on rpa are roughly 15% off from the improved results , estimates of the ground state energy differ roughly 10% .",
    "furthermore , we show that in the optical absorption , rpa considerably overestimates the reduction of spectral weight due to the many - body effects .",
