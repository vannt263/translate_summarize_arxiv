    "heavy ion collisions have received significant attention in recent years .",
    "various possible probes have been studied in order to detect the signatures of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "study of direct photon and dilepton spectra emanating from hot and dense matter formed in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is a field of considerable current interest .",
    "electromagnetic probes have been proposed to be one of the most promising tools to characterize the initial state of the collisions  @xcite . because of the very nature of their interactions with the constituents of the system they tend to leave the system almost unscattered .",
    "in fact , photons ( dilepton as well ) can be used to determine the initial temperature , or equivalently the equilibration time .",
    "these are related to the final multiplicity of the produced hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( hic ) . by comparing the initial temperature with the transition temperature from lattice qcd",
    ", one can infer whether qgp is formed or not .",
    "photons are produced at various stages of the evolution process .",
    "the initial hard scatterings ( compton and annihilation ) of partons lead to photon production which we call hard photons .",
    "if quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is produced initially , there are qgp - photons from thermal compton plus annihilation processes .",
    "photons are also produced from different hadronic reactions from hadronic matter either formed initially ( no qgp scenario ) or realized as a result of a phase transition ( assumed to be first order in the present work ) from qgp .",
    "in addition to that there is a large background of photons coming from @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays .",
    "if this decay contribution is subtracted from the total photon yield what is left is the direct ( excess ) photons .",
    "these apart , there exits another class of photon emission process via the jet conversion mechanism ( jet - plasma interaction )  @xcite which occurs when a high energy jet interacts with the medium constituents via annihilation and compton processes .",
    "it might be noted that this phenomenon ( for compton process ) has been illustrated quite some time ago  @xcite in the context of estimating photons from equilibrating plasma .",
    "there , it is assumed that because of the larger cross - section , gluons equilibrate faster providing a heat bath to the incoming quark - jet .",
    "a comparison of the non - equilibrium photons ( equivalent to photons from jet - plasma interaction ) with the direct photons ( thermal ) shows that this contribution remains dominant for photons with @xmath0 upto 6 gev .",
    "however , while evaluating jet - photon the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite assumes that the largest contribution to photons corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the annihilating quark ( anti - quark ) directly converts into a photon . in the present work ,",
    "we calculate photons from jet - plasma interaction relaxing the above assumption and including the energy loss of the participating jet where the strong coupling constant ( @xmath1 ) is taken as running as given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the phenomena of jet quenching vis - a - vis energy loss have been studied by several authors @xcite taking into account both collisional and radiative losses . however , in the present work , our main concern is to examine the role of collisional loss ( where @xmath1 is running ) in the context of photon production from jet - plasma interaction for the following reason . the suppression of single electron data  @xcite is more than expected which led to the re - thinking of the importance of collisional energy loss in the context of rhic data . a substantial amount of work has been done to look into this issue in recent times  @xcite .",
    "few comments about the recent developments of collisional energy loss are in order here",
    ". it is argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the collisional energy loss is approximately of the same order as the radiative loss .",
    "it is also shown by braun et . al  @xcite that the collisional energy loss increases substantially if the strong coupling is treated as function of temperature and momentum and if , in addition to @xmath5-channel process , the inverse compton reaction is considered . in a most recent calculation , using a reduced screening mass and running coupling the collisional energy loss is six times larger than that with the constant coupling  @xcite",
    ". it explains single electron @xmath6 quite well .",
    "however , it fails to account for the elliptic flow , @xmath7 of the electron .",
    "effective resonance with lo - pqcd model  @xcite also improves the collisional energy loss and the single electron data is well reproduced .",
    "it is also important to note that only the radiative energy loss fails to account for the single electron data at rhic  @xcite . on the other hand , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claims that the collisional energy loss is sub - leading .",
    "however , in order to see the effects of energy loss on jet - photon one should also incorporate the radiative energy loss for completeness and this has to be done in the same formalism in a realistic scenario .",
    "thus , it is apparent that the issue of the relative importance of the mechanism of energy loss in the context of rhic data is not settled yet .",
    "we shall re - visit the importance of collisional energy loss in the context of photons from jet - plasma interactions .",
    "moreover , in high temperature ( @xmath8 ) effective field theory the coupling constant , @xmath1 , is taken to be a function of temperature only , which may be justified when @xmath9 .",
    "however , in the case of relativistic heavy ion collisions , temperature is not the only scale , there is the momentum scale ( @xmath10 ) also .",
    "one has to take into account the case when @xmath11 and treat @xmath1 to be function of both @xmath10 and @xmath8  @xcite . by incorporating this fact",
    "it is shown that the energy loss is by a factor of @xmath12 more than the case when @xmath1 is constant .",
    "it is for this purpose we concentrate on the collisional energy loss  @xcite with the formalism given in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate photons from jet - plasma interaction . for completeness",
    ", we also include the radiative loss in an effective way .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we give a brief description of jet - photon production in qgp in section iia .",
    "the evolution of jet quark and photon @xmath0 distributions are discussed in sections iib and iic respectively .",
    "section iii is devoted to the discussions of results and finally , we summarize in section iv .",
    "the lowest order processes for photon emission from qgp are the compton scattering ( @xmath13 ) and annihilation ( @xmath14 ) process .",
    "the total cross - section diverges in the limit @xmath5 or @xmath15 .",
    "these singularities have to be shielded by thermal effects in order to obtain infrared safe calculations .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the intermediate quark acquires a thermal mass in the medium , whereas the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approach of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that very soft modes are suppressed in a medium providing a natural cut - off @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the singularities can be shielded by the introduction of thermal masses for the participating partons .",
    "apart from the thermal interactions of the plasma partons , interaction of a leading jet parton with the plasma was found to be a very important source of photons .",
    "the differential photon production rate for this process is given by : @xmath17 where , @xmath18 represents the spin averaged matrix element squared for one of those processes which contributes in the photon rate and @xmath19 is the degeneracy factor of the corresponding process .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the initial state and final state partons . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution functions . @xmath23",
    "in the photon production rate ( from jet - plasma interaction ) one of the collision partners is assumed to be in equilibrium and the other ( the jet ) is executing random motion in the heat bath provided by quarks ( anti - quarks ) and gluons . furthermore , the interaction of the jet is dominated by small angle scattering . in such scenario the evolution of the jet phase space distribution",
    "is governed by fokker - planck ( fp ) equation where the collision integral is approximated by appropriately defined drag and diffusion coefficients .    as mentioned already in the introduction",
    "that the quark jet here is not in equilibrium .",
    "therefore the corresponding distribution function ( @xmath20 ) that appears in eq .",
    "( [ photonrate ] ) is calculated by solving the fp equation .",
    "the energy loss is represented by the drag coefficient ( see later ) .",
    "the fp equation , can be derived from boltzmann equation if one of the partners of the binary collisions is in thermal equilibrium and the collisions are dominated by the small angle scattering involving soft momentum exchange  @xcite . for a longitudinally expanding plasma ,",

    "note that the coefficient @xmath28 is related the drag coefficient @xmath29 by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "now , @xmath32 can be decomposed into longitudinal and transverse components : b_ij = b_t ( _ ij- ) + b_l explicit calculation shows that the off diagonal components of @xmath32 vanish and we have , b_t , l&= & ( -*v_pq * ) ( -*v_kq * ) + & & _",
    "t0 ^ 2 f(k)[1+f(k)+ ] q_t , l^2 , [ eq : blt ] where , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , represent diffusion constants along parallel and perpendicular directions of the propagating partons .",
    "evidently , @xmath28 ( @xmath35 ) is infrared singular .",
    "such divergences do not arise if close and distant collisions are treated separately .",
    "for very low momentum transfer the concept of individual collision breaks down and one has to take collective excitations of the plasma into account .",
    "hence there should be a lower momentum cut off above which bare interactions might be considered . while for soft collisions medium modified hard thermal loop corrected propagator should be used  @xcite .",
    "it is evident that eq .",
    "( [ eq : drag1 ] ) actually gives @xmath36 or the energy loss rate  @xcite that can be related to the drag coefficient .",
    "0.5 in    however , in the above treatment , the infra - red cut - off is fixed by plasma effects , where only the medium part is considered , completely neglecting the vacuum contribution leading to ambiguity in the energy loss calculation .",
    "if the latter part is taken into account the strong coupling should be running .",
    "thus for any consistent calculation one has to take into consideration this fact . in that case @xmath37",
    "( @xmath38 in this case ) , and the above integrals must be evaluated numerically where the infra - red cut - off is fixed by debye mass to be solved self - consistently : ( t ) = 4(1+)_s(m_d(t),t)t^2 [ eq : dmass ] we reiterate that the matrix elements in eqs .",

    "@xcite .",
    "so far we have discussed about the collisional energy loss which , although , dominates at lower energies , is not the only mechanism of energy loss . as the energy increases radiative energy loss starts to dominate and hence can not be neglected . in case of jet - photon production ,",
    "since the photon energy is almost equal to the jet energy , one has to include the radiative loss to account for the high @xmath0 photons .",
    "however , in order to see the effects of both the collisional and radiative energy losses , one must develop a formalism in which both the mechanisms can be taken into account in a consistent manner .",
    "the two mechanisms are not entirely independent , i.e. , the collisional loss may influence the radiative loss . thus both should be included to calculate transport coefficients . since there is no rigorous way to implement this , the approximate way is to define effective drag ( diffusion ) in the following manner : @xmath56\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 can be calculated from eq .",
