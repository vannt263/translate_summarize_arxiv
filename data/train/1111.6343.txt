    "weak itinerant ferromagnets ( wifms ) are metallic magnetic systems characterized by very low saturation moment and low curie temperature ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite wifms attracted considerable attention due to their exotic ground state properties such as unusual magnetic excitation , superconductivity , quantum critical behavior , non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) state etc .",
    "@xcite the itinerant magnetism is based on the band theory of electrons and the magnetic moment arises from the exchange splitting of the band .",
    "@xcite in case of wifms , the band splitting is extremely small , and as a result the high field moment per magnetic element is only a fraction of a bohr magneton .",
    "wifms lie very close to the magnetic non - magnetic phase boundary and often a small perturbation can give rise to a large change in the electronic and magnetic properties .    the conventional stoner - wohlfarth theory of band ferromagnetism  @xcite based on hartree - fock mean field theory",
    "is found to be inadequate to explain the various thermodynamical properties of wifms . the theoretical model based on self consistent renormalization ( scr ) approach in presence of spin fluctuations  @xcite is found to be more appropriate describing the electronic and magnetic properties of such materials . among others , several transition metal based intermetallic compounds , such as zrzn@xmath0  @xcite , sc@xmath6 in  @xcite , ni@xmath6al  @xcite , mnsi  @xcite , nbfe@xmath0  @xcite etc .",
    "show weak itinerant ferromagnetism , which is primarily connected to the delocalized nature of the @xmath7 electrons .",
    "the title compound of the present work , y@xmath0ni@xmath1 is also a transition metal based wifm .",
    "y - ni solid solutions show interesting magnetic properties depending upon the ratio of y and ni.@xcite the stoichiometric compounds yni@xmath8 and yni@xmath9 show ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "however , saturation moment and @xmath5 decrease as the ni concentration is further lowered and eventually yni@xmath10 becomes a paramagnetic material . with further decrease in ni concentration , ferromagnetism reappears and the compounds such as y@xmath0ni@xmath1 and yni@xmath6 show weak itinerant ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite finally , ferromagnetic state disappears in case of yni@xmath0 .",
    "evidently , y@xmath0ni@xmath1 remains close to the magnetic and non - magnetic phase boundary .",
    "the weak itinerant character of ferromagnetism in y@xmath0ni@xmath1 is apparent from the low saturation moment and low @xmath5 ( @xmath11 50 k ) as reported in previous studies .",
    "@xcite however , a comprehensive investigation of the ground state magnetic and electronic properties of the material is lacking .",
    "such investigation is necessary to understand the low lying excitation in the system , where magnetic fluctuations play a very crucial role in determining the magnetic state .",
    "another important aspect associated with the low moment ferromagnet like y@xmath0ni@xmath1 is the nature of the paramagnetic ( pm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase transition .",
    "for that , one needs to investigate the critical region and the corresponding critical exponents .",
    "this can provide us the order , the universality class and the effective dimensionality of the phase transition .",
    "the present paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "firstly , a thorough investigations have been presented based on the magnetic , transport and heat capacity measurements .",
    "later we have provided the criticality and scaling behavior of y@xmath0ni@xmath1 around @xmath5 using modified arrott plot , kouvel - fisher plot and critical isotherm method .    0.4 cm    0.4 cm    0.4 cm    0.4 cm",
    "the bulk polycrystalline sample of y@xmath0ni@xmath1 for the present investigation was prepared by argon arc melting followed by annealing at 1000@xmath12c for 500 h. the x - ray powder diffraction pattern ( using cu k@xmath13 ) were collected using a seifert xrd3000p diffractometer ( cu k@xmath13 radiation , 2@xmath14 range from 30@xmath12 to 80@xmath12 with step size 0.02@xmath12 ) .",
    "the collected powder patterns have been used for rietveld refinement ( see inset of fig",

    "@xcite the analysis shows that the sample was formed in single phase with rhombohedral gd@xmath15co@xmath1 type crystal structure ( space group : @xmath16 ) with lattice parameters @xmath17 = 4.952  , @xmath18 = 36.230  , and @xmath19 = 888.44 @xmath20 , which match well with previous result .",
    "@xcite    magnetization ( @xmath21 ) measurements on y@xmath0ni@xmath1 sample was carried out on a quantum design squid magnetometer ( mpms 6 , evercool model ) .",
    "the resistivity ( @xmath22 ) and magnetoresistance ( mr ) were measured on a cryogen - free high magnetic field system from cryogenic ltd . , uk . the heat capacity ( @xmath23 )",
    "was recorded on a qantum design physical property measurement system down to 2 k.",

    "this corresponds to the pm to fm transition in the sample and the associated @xmath5 is found to be around 53 k. this value of @xmath5 has been calculated from the first @xmath24 derivative of @xmath27 ( not shown here ) . above 200 k , @xmath28 varies linearly with @xmath24 ( see inset of fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) , which signifies the validity of curie - weiss law at high-@xmath24 .",
    "linear fit to the high-@xmath24 part of @xmath28 _ vs. _ @xmath24 data gives the paramagnetic effective moment @xmath29= 0.93 @xmath30/ni and paramagnetic curie temperature @xmath31 = 40 k. these values are close to the previously reported results .",

    "1(b ) shows the @xmath21 versus @xmath26 isotherm recorded at 4 k. we observe fm like behaviour with steep rise at low @xmath26 and a sluggish increase at higher fields . till @xmath26 = 50 koe , @xmath21",
    "does not show complete saturation .",
    "this lack of saturation is presumably connected to the itinerant character of the ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite the magnetic moment for @xmath26 = 50 koe is found to be 0.06 @xmath30/ni , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the _ per atom _ moment in metallic ni ( 0.64 @xmath30/ni ) .",
    "@xcite such small value of moment in y@xmath0ni@xmath1 is an indication of the very weak fm nature of the sample .",
    "the observed moment is comparable with the results reported in previous studies on y@xmath0ni@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite it is to be noted that there is no hysteresis in the field increasing and decreasing legs of the @xmath32 isotherm , indicating a very soft fm character of the sample .",
    "the itinerant ferromagnetism is often characterized by the rhodes - wolhfarth ratio , which is defined as rwr = @xmath33 .",
    "here @xmath34 is related to @xmath29 by the relation @xmath29 = @xmath34(@xmath34 + 2 ) , while @xmath35 is the saturation moment per magnetic atom at the temperature of interest .",
    "@xcite for a localized system , the value of rwr should be close to 1 , while it diverges for itinerant ferromagnets . for y@xmath0ni@xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath35 has been calculated from the @xmath32 isotherm at 4 k and the resulting rwr is found to be 6.17 .",
    "this value is much larger than unity and provides support for the itinerant character of ferromagnetism in y@xmath0ni@xmath1 .",
    "it is to be noted that for a typical wifm such as zrzn@xmath0 , the rwr is close to 5.4 .",
    "@xcite    0.4 cm      @xmath24 dependence of @xmath22 for y@xmath0ni@xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "clear signature of change in slope is observable around @xmath36 53 k. at low-@xmath24 ( below @xmath11 18 k , in the fm state ) , @xmath37 shows a well defined @xmath38 dependence ( @xmath39 ) as evident from the upper inset of fig .",
    "such @xmath38 dependence is the typical fermi liquid behavior arising from the electron - electron scattering which generally does not involve spin - flip process .",

    "@xcite the scr theory which incorporates spin fluctuations in wifm also predicts a @xmath38 dependence of @xmath22 well below @xmath5 .",
    "however , this @xmath38 dependence has different origin than the simple electron - electron scattering and it is connected to the _ spin - flip _ scattering of @xmath40 electrons by the spin density fluctuations of the @xmath7 electrons via @xmath41 exchange interaction .",
    "@xcite notably , the coefficient @xmath42 of the @xmath38 term is found to be rather large in case of y@xmath0ni@xmath1 with its value being 5.04 @xmath4310@xmath44 @xmath45k@xmath46 .",

    "@xcite we have fitted the @xmath38 dependent part of @xmath37 to the formula @xmath39 and it has been observed that @xmath42 decreases with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the applied field tends to quench the spin fluctuations .",

    "the ground state physical properties indicate the wifm character of the sample , which is particularly evident from the large value of the coefficient of @xmath38 term in @xmath22 and large coefficient of the linear term in @xmath23 .",

    "it is to be noted that their ratio @xmath59 is an important parameter to ascertain the fermi liquid state in a metal .",
    "@xcite the coefficient @xmath42 in @xmath22 arises from the electron - electron scattering and it is found to be proportional to the square of the effective mass of the conduction electrons . on the other hand the electronic specific heat coefficient is linearly proportional to the effective mass",
    ". therefore , within a class of materials obeying renormalized band picture , the ratio should have universal value .",
    "for heavy fermion metals , the ratio is found to be close to 1.0@xmath4310@xmath60 cm mole@xmath61 k@xmath61 j@xmath46 .",

    "@xcite this contradictory result in y@xmath0ni@xmath1 might be an indication of field induced instability in the fermi liquid ground state of y@xmath0ni@xmath1 .",
    "it is to be noted that the sample remains fm in high fields and @xmath5 does not decrease with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the emergence of nfl like state with @xmath26 can not be attributed to the fact that the system is nearing to a quantum critical point .",
    "@xcite it is to be noted that zrzn@xmath0 shows nfl like resistivity behavior at the ambient condition in the fm state .",
    "@xcite coexistence of fm and nfl states has been observed in the alloys uru@xmath67re@xmath68si@xmath0 and it is found to be feasible if we consider the material to be disordered and anisotropic leading to the formation of fm clusters .",
    "@xcite such scenario can not be ruled out in case of y@xmath0ni@xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "electronic structure calculations indicates a weak peak in the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level of y@xmath0ni@xmath1 , which is found to be responsible for the wifm character .",

    "the kouvel - fisher plot can provide the most accurate values of the critical exponents .",

    "7 ) produces two curves for the state below and above @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "7 ( b ) ) .",
    "this proves the authenticity of the calculated exponents .    in table",
    "ii , we show the theoretical values of critical exponents for mean field , 3d ising and 3d heisenberg models .",
    "notably , the calculated exponents do not match well with any of the 3d models .",
    "similar discrepancy was also observed in various other itinerant magnetic systems and it has been attributed to the length scale of interaction .",
    "the 3d ising and heisenberg models described in table ii are of _ short range _ type , _",
    "i.e. _ the spin spin interaction falls off rapidly with distance .",
    "however , for itinerant system , the interaction can be of long range due to the mobile electrons .",
    "it has been observed that for long range interaction , the spin - spin interaction term varies as @xmath69 , where @xmath7 is the effective dimensionality of the system , @xmath70 is the spin - spin distance and @xmath71 is an exponent .",
    "@xcite it has been found that for @xmath72 2 , such model for long range interaction can hold good .    in case cr - fe itinerant system",
    "@xcite , the observed critical exponents were explained on the basis of long range interaction .",
    "@xcite it was found that for @xmath71 = 1.34 , the observed exponents ( @xmath2 = 0.298 @xmath3 = 1.392 @xmath4 = 5.67 ) match well with 2d ising model coupled with long range interaction .",
    "interestingly , like cr - fe system , the critical exponents obtained for y@xmath0ni@xmath1 from the present study are also very close to the 2d ising model with long range interaction .",
    "therefore , it appears that y@xmath0ni@xmath1 also has the same universality class of cr - fe alloys as far as the critical exponents are concerned .",
    "prompted by the similarity , we have also used the same method to calculate the value of @xmath71 that produces the best suitable set of critical exponents . for long range interaction , the exponent @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a known function ( see equation 9 of reference  @xcite ) and @xmath75 is the dimension of the order parameter .",
    "the other exponents are related to @xmath71 as @xmath76 , @xmath77 = 2-@xmath78 , @xmath2 = ( 2@xmath79)/2 , and @xmath4 = 1 + @xmath80 .",
    "we have used an iterative method to calculate @xmath71 from these relations starting from the experimental value of @xmath3 (= 1.40 ) and the best match to our experimental data is obtained for @xmath7 = 2 , @xmath75 = 1 and @xmath71 = 1.38 . this long range 2d ising model with @xmath71",
    "= 1.38 produces critical exponents @xmath2 = 0.314 , @xmath3 = 1.40 , and @xmath4 = 5.46 , which match very well with our experimentally obtained values .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recently such long range model for magnetic interaction was also found to be suitable for explaining the critical behavior of itinerant manganite pr@xmath81sr@xmath81mno@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite    the possible long range spin spin interaction in case of y@xmath0ni@xmath1 can be understood on the itinerant character of the electrons responsible for magnetism .",
    "since the electrons are delocalized , the spin - spin interaction can be of long range .",
    "the 2d ising character of the magnetic interaction can have its origin in the anisotropic crystal structure .",
    "y@xmath0ni@xmath1 has gd@xmath0co@xmath1 type rhombohedral structure , which can be considered to be derived by stacking yni@xmath10 and yni@xmath0 slabs in 2:1 ratio along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "such layered arrangements of atoms can give rise to effectively 2d character of the magnetic interaction .",
