    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are bursts of gamma radiations that are isotropically distributed on the sky .",
    "their time duration @xmath3 ranges from @xmath4 s up to @xmath5 s , and their measured spectroscopic redshifts range is @xmath6 . based on the time duration ,",
    "they are divided into two different groups : grbs with @xmath7 s are classified as short duration bursts , and those with @xmath8 s as long duration grbs .",
    "the spectral lag ( @xmath9 ) of a grb is a parameter that measures the delay time between the soft and hard light curves of the grb .",
    "the global hard - to - soft spectral evolution of grb pulses was found by @xcite in analysis of smm ( solar maximum mission satellite ) grb data , and a cross - correlation analysis between different channels of data for calculating @xmath9 values was performed by @xcite .",
    "a power law function between the @xmath9 value and the peak luminosity ( l ) was well fitted for six batse and bepposax long grbs with measured redshifts @xcite . in the power law function ,",
    "the @xmath9 is corrected for the cosmological time dilation effect by dividing a factor of ( 1+z ) .",
    "it was also pointed out in the same paper that grb980425 with a long @xmath9 value ( @xmath10 s ) falls far below the power law fitting curve by a factor of several hundred .",
    "the empirical @xmath11 relation can be simply explained as a consequence of radiative cooling of the shocked material in the jet @xcite .",
    "high - luminosity bursts will have fast radiative cooling and hence short lags , while low - luminosity bursts will have slow radiative cooling and hence long lags .",
    "this general result predicts that the burst luminosity should be proportional to @xmath12 and that is exactly what is observed .",
    "the @xmath9 analysis on batse and integral samples shows a distribution from @xmath13 s for long grbs @xcite , with most of these @xmath9 concentrated in the 0 - 1 s region . according to the @xmath11 relation",
    ", a long @xmath9 corresponds with a low luminosity , and for a low luminosity grb to be detected by our instruments , it should be relatively nearby .",
    "@xcite pointed out that grb980425 might represent a subclass of long grbs , with long @xmath9 , soft spectrum , ultra - low luminosity , and nearby . in this case , a possible break might exist in the @xmath11 relation in the long @xmath9 region , which would indicate that these long @xmath9 grbs are even closer than what is predicted by the @xmath14 relation . indeed , two long @xmath9 bursts are confidently known to be at distances close enough to be inside the local supercluster .",
    "grb980425 , with @xmath10 s , had an ultra - low luminosity , and lies in a galaxy only @xmath15 mpc away @xcite .",
    "grb830801 , is the all - time brightest grb yet has a long @xmath9 ( @xmath16 s ) , so a very low redshift of @xmath17 is calculated from the @xmath11 relation @xcite .",
    "grb830801 also happens to be from a direction close to the virgo cluster .",
    "given that these long @xmath9 grbs might be nearby , is there any local structure of galaxies to host these grbs ?",
    "the local supercluster was proposed by @xcite , from an investigation of spatial distribution of galaxies .",
    "it was first named as ` supergalaxy ' , which was later changed to be ` local supercluster ' @xcite .",
    "more detailed studies show that the main body of the local supercluster is a filamentary structure extending over @xmath18 mpc , and is centered on the virgo cluster @xcite . around @xmath19 of the luminous galaxies in the volume of local supercluster",
    "are within the structure that defines the plane of the supercluster ( @xmath20 in virgo cluster and @xmath21 in virgo ii cloud and canes venatici cloud ) , and most of the remaining @xmath21 lies within five clouds off the plane , which is called a ` halo ' @xcite .",
    "our local group is in the outskirt of this region .",
    "@xcite presented a catalog of @xmath9 values for 1429 batse long grbs , from which a sample of 64 long @xmath9 grbs ( with @xmath22 s ) was selected .",
    "these @xmath9 values were calculated in the observer s rest frame , without making the time dilation correction ( which should be small for local bursts ) . by plotting these long @xmath9 bursts on a sky map in supergalactic coordinates ,",
    "a concentration towards the supergalactic plane was found , with three - fourth of these bursts located in the half of the sky between @xmath23 and @xmath24 of supergalactic latitude .",
    "quantitatively , the quadruple moment of these grbs is roughly @xmath25 , which shows a @xmath26 deviation from isotropy .",
    "this result implies that long @xmath9 value will be an indicator for local grbs . from the solid long grb - sn connection ( e.g. grb980425 & sn1998bw , grb030329 & sn2003dh ) and the model of massive sn ( from the collapsing in highly non - axisymmetric modes )",
    ", strong gravitational waves can be produced at a rate of @xmath27 , and these gravitational waves might be able to be detected by ligo @xcite .",
    "an independent catalog of long @xmath9 bursts discovered by integral has been created by @xcite , with 11 long @xmath9 ( @xmath28 s ) grbs being pulled out from the whole integral sample .",
    "they found that 10 of the 11 long @xmath9 bursts are located within the @xmath23 to @xmath24 supergalactic latitude region .",
    "the quadruple moment of the 11 grbs is @xmath29 .",
    "this result is confirmed by @xcite . by comparing with the simulation based on integral sky coverage , the quadruple moment is @xmath30 for long @xmath9 grbs and @xmath31 for the whole sample .",
    "the integral result is broadly consistent with the conclusion of @xcite , however , in @xcite , the quadruple moments for the samples of @xmath32 s and @xmath33 s have a substantially lower significance ( @xmath34 for the @xmath32 s sample and @xmath35 for the @xmath33 s sample ) . with three results on two independent samples ( pointing to a concentration towards the supergalactic plane )",
    ", another sample is needed to test the local supercluster hypothesis .",
    "_ swift _ , the multiwavelength grb detection satellite , was launched nov .",
    "2004 @xcite .",
    "it has three instruments on board .",
    "the wide field burst alert telescope ( bat ) , which covers 15 kev to 150 kev energy band , can position a burst to @xmath36 accuracy .",
    "the narrow x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and uv / optical telescope ( uvot ) will start observing the grb within @xmath37 s after it is triggered and position it within @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively . within @xmath37",
    "s , this accurate position of the grb will be measured and distributed to the community through grb coordinate network ( gcn ) , and large ground telescopes will be able to follow up and make their own observations . during its four years of operation , _ swift _ has been triggered by more than 350 grbs , @xmath40 of which have been confirmed as long duration grbs , and @xmath41 have their spectroscopic or photometric redshift measured .",
    "the accurate localizations of _ swift _ grbs make possible the search for hosts of long @xmath9 bursts in local supercluster galaxies .",
    "the grb redshift will also directly tell us the distances of these grbs .    in this paper , we will use _ swift _ data to test the hypothesis that most long @xmath9 grbs are in the local supercluster .",
    "the tests are made of four parts : ( 1 ) is there any tendency of concentration towards the supergalactic plane ?",
    "( 2 ) is there any tendency of concentration towards the virgo cluster ? ( 3 ) can we find bright host galaxies for these long @xmath9 grbs ? ( 4 ) do any of these long @xmath9 grbs have a redshift of @xmath42 ?",
    "all _ swift _ grb data are available on the legacy ftp site , along with the software published by the _ swift _ team .",
    "bat light curves for grbs within any possible energy bands ( 15 kev to 150 kev ) at any possible time bins ( @xmath43s ) can be generated .",
    "conventionally , for the calculation of @xmath9 , we use the light curves with 0.064 s time bins and energy bands from 25 - 50 kev and 100 - 150 kev . by applying a cross - correlation function ( ccf ) method on the light curves , and fitting the ccf plot with an automatically selected polynomial function",
    ", we calculated the @xmath9 values for all _ swift _ long grbs .",
    "details of our conventional calculation are presented in @xcite . in the same paper , by using the @xmath9 values as well as four other luminosity indicators ( variability , minimum rise time @xmath44 , number of peaks @xmath45 and peak energy in the spectrum @xmath46 ) , we calculated the redshifts for all _ swift _ long grbs completely independent of spectroscopic redshifts .",

    "the celestial right ascension and declination of these grbs from bat localizations are listed in columns 5 and 6 , and the corresponding latitude and longitude in supergalactic coordinate systems are listed in columns 7 and 8 . the conversion from celestial coordinate system to the supergalactic coordinate system is done by using the online tools provided on a nasa website .",
    "column 9 lists the galaxy information within the field of the grbs , with all the references given in column 10 .",
    "all information of the galaxies are drawn from the reports on gcn circulars and the digital sky survey .",
    "the sky distribution of these long @xmath9 grbs in supergalactic coordinates are plotted in figure 1 . at first glance , there is no tendency of concentration either towards the supergalactic plane or towards the virgo or coma cluster .",
    "more detailed analysis are presented in the next section .",
    "our local supercluster has a flattened distribution , with @xmath19 of its luminous galaxies in the structure which is called the plane of the local supercluster , and the other @xmath21 lies in five clouds off the plane , called the ` halo ' .",
    "if long @xmath9 grbs reside in galaxies in our local supercluster , they will show a tendency of concentration towards the supergalactic plane .",
    "to quantitatively measure the tendency of the concentration , a quadruple moment of the distribution can be calculated , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite , where _ b _ is the latitude of grbs in supergalactic coordinate and @xmath54 is the number of grbs .",
    "a significant concentration towards the plane will result in a negative q value , while an isotropic distribution will result in a near - zero q value .",
    "both the quadruple moments of @xcite ( @xmath55 ) and of @xcite ( @xmath56 ) show high significance ( with @xmath57 ) of a concentration towards the supergalactic plane .    for our long @xmath9 burst sample from _ swift _ , by simply counting the number of grbs , we get only 8 of a total of 18 ( @xmath58 ) lying between -30@xmath59 and 30@xmath59 in supergalactic latitude , which is in agreement with the area coverage percentage within the usual uncertainties .",
    "the calculated quadruple moment of this distribution is @xmath60 .",
    "it is not significantly negative .",
    "instead , the q value equals zero within @xmath51 uncertainty and this is an indication of a homogeneous distribution .",
    "we also raised the lower limit of the ` long @xmath9 ' criteria to @xmath61 s and @xmath22 s , and calculated the quadruple moment for these subsamples .",
    "the results of @xmath62 for @xmath61 s and @xmath63 for @xmath22 s also show no tendency towards the supergalactic plane .",
    "the samples and our results are shown in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "a real - time sky map of _ swift _ grbs shows a nearly isotropic sky distribution for _ swift _ bursts , and the quadruple moment for all short @xmath9 ( @xmath64 s ) long duration grbs ( @xmath65 ) also shows an isotropic sky distribution , with no tendency either towards or away from the supergalactic plane . with this",
    ", we see that _ swift _ has a uniform sky coverage for the purpose of this paper , and so our quadruple moment of the long @xmath9 bursts needs no correction for sky coverage . as such",
    ", we find no concentration towards the supergalactic plane , and the supergalactic hypothesis fails our first test .",
    "the majority of the mass in our local supercluster is towards the virgo cluster and the coma cluster ( which is in about the same direction as the virgo cluster , but with much larger distance from the earth ) .",
    "so if these long @xmath9 grbs are from the local supercluster , there should be a tendency of concentration towards the virgo and coma clusters .",
    "a dipole moment can be calculated to quantitatively measure the concentration , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite , in which @xmath68 is the angle between the grb and the virgo or coma cluster .",
    "a concentration towards the virgo or coma cluster will result in a positive dipole moment , while an isotropic distribution would result in a near - zero dipole moment .",
    "d values for a majority of long _ swift _ grbs ( 331 bursts with @xmath64 s ) shows no tendency towards or away from virgo and coma clusters , as shown in table [ tbl-2 ] . the fact that the dipole for the @xmath64 s bursts is closely zero tells us that the _ swift _ sky coverage is sufficiently uniform for the purpose of this paper and no correction to our measured d values is needed .",
    "we calculated the dipole moment of our long @xmath9 grbs , towards both the virgo and coma clusters .",
    "for the virgo cluster , the dipole moments are @xmath69 for @xmath33 s sample , @xmath70 for the @xmath61 s subsample , and @xmath71 for the @xmath22 s subsample . while for coma cluster , the calculated dipole moments are respectively @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 for the three cuts on @xmath9 . with the _ negative _ dipole moments , _ swift _ long @xmath9 bursts are showing a tendency _ away from _ the virgo and coma clusters .",
    "hence the hypothesis that these grbs are from the local supercluster fails our second test . by checking figure 5 in @xcite and",
    "figure 3 in @xcite , we do not see any tendency towards the virgo or coma cluster .      as long grbs",
    "are formed by the collapsing of fast - rotating massive stars , they should be located in the star forming region of galaxies ( e.g. in the spiral arms of the spiral galaxies ) , and these galaxies should appear within the small _",
    "swift_-xrt @xmath75 error circles .",
    "if these galaxies are members of the local supercluster , given the scale of the local supercluster ( @xmath18 mpc ) , they should be rather nearby , and hence relatively bright .",
    "if we adopt the r - band schechter luminosity function with @xmath76 ( for a hubble constant of 65 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 ; @xcite ) , a galaxy in our local supercluster with luminosity of @xmath78 will have its absolute magnitude of @xmath79 .",
    "this limit of @xmath78 is somewhat arbitrary , but it does include @xmath75 of the mass in a standard luminosity function .",
    "such a galaxy on the far edge of local supercluster ( for which we adopt a distance of @xmath80 mpc ) will have an apparent magnitude of @xmath81 or brighter .",
    "an increasing of hubble constant from 65 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 to 72 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 will cause a slightly decreasing of the distance , and hence a brighter apparent magnitude for the threshold . as a result ,",
    "if the long @xmath9 grbs reside in our local supercluster , we should be able to find their host galaxies with @xmath82 .",
    "that is , any grb from our local supercluster should be immediately obvious by having its bright host galaxy in the _",
    "swift_-xrt error circle .",
    "we checked all the gcn reports regarding to these long @xmath9 grbs , and all these 18 grbs have follow up observations reported except for grb060607b ( which was too close to the sun ) .",
    "possible host galaxies are found for grb050126 and grb060218 , with redshifts of 1.29 and 0.0331 . with accurate positions reported by xrt",
    ", no galaxies are found to be within the xrt @xmath75 error circles for the remaining 16 grbs .",
    "we also searched through the digital sky survey for the fields of these grbs , and no galaxies are found to be within the xrt error circle for all of the 18 grbs in poss ii - f archive , the limit magnitude of which is 20.8 .",
    "hence the supergalactic hypothesis fails this test also .",
    "grb060218 is a very long and smooth burst with a very long lag @xcite .",
    "an optical transient was speedily discovered with uvot @xcite and with rotse @xcite .",
    "the burst position is coincident with a nearby galaxy at z = 0.0331 @xcite .",
    "later , a supernova ( sn2006aj ) was found at the same position @xcite .",
    "the position is on the edge of the constellation taurus , with @xmath83 to the virgo cluster and @xmath84 to the coma cluster . for the redshift and a hubble constant of @xmath85 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77",
    ", the burst is @xmath86 mpc distant from the earth .",
    "this is close , but certainly outside our local supercluster .",
    "as such , this long @xmath9 burst is an example of an extremely under - luminous event , but is not associated with any concentration towards the supergalactic plane .      given that the distance of galaxies in local supercluster are less than 56 mpc from the earth ( for the hubble constant @xmath87 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 ) , the corresponding upper limit on the redshift is @xmath88 . if the long @xmath9 grbs are from the local supercluster , they should be at redshift @xmath42 or so .    of our 18 long @xmath9 grbs ,",
    "5 have their spectroscopic redshift reported , ranging from 1.29 to 3.08 ( as listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "these bursts are certainly far outside the local supercluster .",
    "the redshift of grb050126 is measured from the spectrum of its host galaxy , while the other 4 are all from multiple absorption lines in the optical afterglow spectra , hence these redshift values are with high confidence .",
    "the sixth grb with a spectroscopic redshift is grb060218 , with z = 0.0331 , which is also too far to be inside our local supercluster ( see previous section ) . with six out of six long @xmath9 grbs having their spectroscopic redshift much larger than the upper limit redshift of local supercluster ( 0.013 ) , we are very confident to make the conclusion that the supergalactic hypothesis fails this test also . while for the remaining 12 grbs without spectroscopic redshifts , our redshift calculated from luminosity indicators @xmath47",
    "are within the range of 0.6 to 5.0 @xcite , and the @xmath51 lower limit of redshifts for all these grbs are @xmath2 . in summary , all these _ swift _ long @xmath9 bursts are certainly outside the local supercluster , with 17 out of 18 at @xmath2 .",
    "hence the supergalactic hypothesis fails the fourth test for all of 18 long @xmath9 grbs .",
    "moreover , if we check the whole _ swift _",
    "grb catalog ( with long and short @xmath9 values ) , it is easy to see that only one of all the grbs ( grb980425 ) with reported spectroscopic redshift are close enough to be in our local supercluster .",
    "the lack of low redshift grbs in the catalog also indicates that it is impossible to have a large fraction of long @xmath9 of grbs in local supercluster .",
    "the local supercluster hypothesis strongly failed all of our four tests .",
    "although some small fraction of long @xmath9 grbs can still be local ( e.g. grb980425 , grb830801 ) , our analysis on _ swift _ data puts a limit of @xmath89 on the fraction of long @xmath9 grbs to be in local supercluster .",
    "both the results of @xcite and @xcite show a high significance ( with @xmath57 ) on the tendency of concentration towards the supergalactic plane , which is not significantly high .",
    "given that batse positions have had many selections of grbs examined for anisotropies in many directions @xcite , with this large number of trials , we can expect that some will be significant at this level .    from our analysis",
    ", only a small fraction of long @xmath9 grbs ( less than one out of eighteen or so ) could be in the local supercluster .",
    "hence , the rate of long @xmath9 grbs in the local supercluster is greatly smaller than what has been reported by @xcite , and should not be included in the calculation of ligo s detection rate .    from table [ tbl-1 ]",
    "we see that redshifts for these long @xmath9 grbs ( @xmath90 ) are not greatly lower than for other grbs ( @xmath91 ) . from the logic that long @xmath9 corresponds with low luminosity",
    ", one might be curious as to how we can detect a @xmath33 s grb at redshift as high as @xmath92 ?",
    "grb980425 is an example of long @xmath9 and low redshift ( @xmath93 ) grb , and it is _ very _ under - luminous ( with its @xmath94-ray peak luminosity @xmath95 according to @xcite ) .",
    "of course if we put grb980425 to the redshift of @xmath92 , its luminosity distance will be increasing by a factor of @xmath96 , and it s peak flux will be decreasing by a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "with such a low peak flux , we will definitely not be able to detect it .",
    "however , grb980425 is not a typical grb .",

    "grb980425 might represent a subclass of long grbs with long @xmath9 , soft spectrum and low luminosity , as suggested by @xcite , but with only one example , it is unreasonable for us to take all long @xmath9 grbs as ultra - low luminosity bursts .",
    "consider a ` normal ' long grb that has @xmath98 s and redshift @xmath92 .",
