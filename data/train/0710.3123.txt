    "it is well known that the lagrangian ( therefore the hamiltonian ) formulation for some systems of more than one dimension may not exists ( douglas 1941 ) .",
    "fortunately for our study of the nature up to now , most of our physical systems have avoided this problem , and the whole quantum and statistical mechanics of non - dissipative systems can be given in terms of a lagrangian or hamiltonian formulation .",
    "now , for dissipative systems there have been two main approaches .",
    "the first one consists of keeping the same hamiltonian formalism for the whole system where the interacting background is included , as a result , one brings about a master equation with the dissipation and diffusion parameters appearing as part of the solution ( caldeira and legget 1983 , unruh and zurek 1989 , and hu et al 1992 ) .",
    "this approach has its own merit , but it will not be followed in this paper .",
    "we will follow the second approach which consists in to obtain a phenomenological velocity depending hamiltonian , representing a classical dissipative system , and to proceed to make the usual quantization ( or statistical mechanics ) with this hamiltonian .    within this last approach , one can , additionally , study the mathematical consistence of the the hamiltonian formalism in quantum and statical mechanics .",
    "it is also known that even for one - dimensional systems , where the existence of their lagrangian is guaranteed ( darboux 1894 ) , the lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations are not free from problems ( havas 1973 , okubo 1980 , dodonov et al 1981 , marmon et al 1985 , glauber et al 1984 , @xmath0lpez 1998 , and @xmath1lpez 1999 ) .",
    "one of the main problems is the implication on the quantization of the associated classical system when different hamiltonians describe the same classical system ( @xmath2lpez 2002 ) .",
    "this ambiguity has already been studied for the harmonic oscillator with dissipation and some general system ( @xmath3lpez 1996 ) . in this paper , we want to show explicitly this ambiguity by studying the free falling particle within a medium which has the effect on the particle of producing the dissipation .",
    "this dissipation depends quadratically on the velocity of the particle .",
    "firstly , two constants of motion are deduced for this system . secondly , with these constants of motion two lagrangian and two hamiltonian are obtained using a known procedure ( @xmath3lpez 1996 and @xmath4lpez and hernndez 1989 ) . finally ,",
    "using the hamiltonian expression at first order in the dissipation parameter , the resulting eigenvalues of their associated quantum hamiltonian and their associated statistical mechanics properties ( for an ensemble of particles ) are shown .",
    "the motion of the particle of mass @xmath5 falling under a constant gravitational force , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the constant acceleration due to gravity , which is within a dissipative medium which has the effect on the particle of producing a force proportional to the square of the velocity of the particle , @xmath8 for @xmath9 , can be described by the following autonomous dynamical system @xmath10 where the variable @xmath11 represents the vertical position of the particle , and @xmath12 represents its velocity .",
    "a constant of motion for this system is a function @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , i.e. it satisfies the following equation ( @xmath15lpez 1999 ) @xmath16 the general solution of this equation is given by ( john 1974 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an arbitrary function of the characteristic curve @xmath19 .",
    "this characteristic curve can be given in two different ways as @xmath20 or @xmath21 considering that one must obtain the usual constant of motion ( energy ) expression for @xmath22 equal to zero , the functionality of @xmath18 in eq .",

    "using the know expression ( kobussen 1979 , leuber 1987 , yan 1981 , and @xmath3lpez 1996 ) ,    @xmath28    to get the lagrangian , the lagrangian associated to eq .",

    "one must note that the following limits are gotten    @xmath40    @xmath41    and    @xmath42    at first order in the dissipation parameter @xmath22 , the hamiltonians are given by    @xmath43    and    @xmath44",
    "our hamiltonians eq .  (",
    "[ ii : h1f ] ) and eq .  ( [ ii : h2f ] ) can be written as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 represents the non dissipative part of the hamiltonian , @xmath47 and @xmath48 represents the contribution of the dissipation at first order in @xmath22 ,    @xmath49    and    @xmath50    the schrdinger equation , @xmath51 represents an stationary problem .",
    "therefore , in order to get the quantization of the system , one just need to solve the following eigenvalue problem    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the associated hermitian operator of eq .",
    "( [ ii : hq ] ) . of course",
    ", one must not allow the particle to go beyond down the surface level .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ ii : h0q ] ) is representing the hamiltonian of the quantum bouncer ( @xmath54 ) ( gean - banacloche 1999 ) , where the eigenvalue problem    @xmath55    has the eigenvectors and eigenvalues solution given by    @xmath56    and    @xmath57    the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the airy function and its differentiation respect to @xmath60 .",

    "( [ ii : w2 ] ) at first order in perturbation theory is    @xmath67    now , using the relation @xmath68 , the correction at first order in perturbation due to eq .  ( [ ii : w1 ] ) is given by    @xmath69    therefore , for the same classical dynamical system we have two different associated quantum systems which have completely different quantum dynamics , which is shown through the eigenvalues    @xmath70    and    @xmath71",
    "consider a system of @xmath72 particles , where @xmath73 particles are small of mass @xmath74 , and @xmath75 particles are are big of mass @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the small particles move under the action of an external force with components @xmath78 and suffer collisions with the walls of the container which consists in a narrow - square shape pipe of cross sectional area @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , each small particle can have occasional ( stochastic ) collision with the big particles , when they are added , establishes the dissipative medium where the big particles will move .",
    "the big particles move in this dissipative medium , and it is assumed that , since this type of collision does not occur frequently , its average effect may have neglected contribution on the dynamical macroscopic variables of the system .",
    "newton s equations of motion for this system can be written as    @xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    where @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the generalized coordinates , velocities and accelerations of the light - small ( @xmath87 ) and heavy - gross ( @xmath88 ) particles , and the parameter @xmath22 characterizes the dissipative medium .",

    "this difference seems to have an important implication related with the ergodic hypothesis ( toda et al 1998 ) . assuming the validity of the hypothesis",
    ", one would expect not difference at all on the calculated heat capacities ( or internal energies ) since averaging over the time variable must bring about the same value for both hamiltonians ( they represent the same dynamical system ) .",
    "however , averaging over the canonical ensemble must be different if the hamiltonians are different .",
    "this ambiguity will remain when quantum canonical ensemble is considered ( using eq .",

    "these quantities describe the same dynamics of the classical system , but their quantization and the associated statistical mechanics ( for an ensemble of particles ) describe two different quantum and statistical dynamics .",
    "we have showed this at first order in the dissipative parameter and at first order in perturbation theory .",
    "there is still a point which reamins to to study and has to deal with quasi - classical limit .",
    "the question is whether or not both quantum hamiltonians , eq .",
    "( [ ii : hq ] ) , describes the same quasi - classical dynamics ( @xmath134 ) and coincides with the classical dynamics in this limit .",
