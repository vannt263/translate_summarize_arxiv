    "the configuration involves two orthogonally polarized beams incident on @xmath0rb , both resonant with the transition between hyperfine levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "one of them is polarized along the axis of quantization and denoted @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "this is referred to as @xmath4 beam .",
    "the other beam , referred to as @xmath5 beam , is denoted as @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "this beam is a plane polarized beam in the xy plane and can effectively be decomposed into a pair of circularly polarized beams with opposite helicities @xmath7 .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 beams can be derived from a single laser source by use of a halfwave plate and a polarizing beam splitter as shown in figure 1a . by rotating the hwp",
    ", the full intensity of the laser can be distributed between these two beams as desired .",
    "following the selection rules involved with polarizations @xcite , these two beams couple transitions between the various zeeman subleves as shown in figure 1b .",
    "the levels labeled @xmath8 in and @xmath9 in the figure denote the zeeman sublevels of the ground state @xmath1 with m@xmath10 values @xmath11,@xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "similarly the levels labeled @xmath14 and @xmath15 are those of the excited state @xmath2 , with = @xmath16 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath4 beam therefore couples transitions @xmath17 which results in @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath19 component of @xmath5 couples @xmath20 component couples @xmath21 and latexmath:[$|g_+\\ra \\lr    @xmath12 respectively . the transition between latexmath:[$|g_0\\ra \\lr    @xmath18 because the clebsch - gordon coefficients for this transition vanishes due to symmetry considerations .",
    "if only the @xmath5 beam is present and @xmath24 , then the configuration is a classical @xmath25 system formed by @xmath26 , leaving the atomic population in the coherent population trap ( cpt ) state @xmath27 $ ] @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if only @xmath4 beam is present , the atoms in @xmath28 levels absorb this light and reach @xmath29 and subsequently decay to all three ground states .",
    "those that decay into @xmath28 get pumped again to @xmath29 whereas those that reach @xmath30 get trapped in it .",
    "after a few cycles , all atoms are optically pumped to @xmath30 . in this way , the configuration exhibits two trap states @xmath31 with respect to @xmath4 beam and @xmath32 $ ] which can be obtained by the @xmath5 beam . by switching between these two beams ,",
    "the atom can be pumped out of one of these two states and prepared in the other .",
    "now these two states can be mapped onto two qubit states @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the atom can be prepared in either of the two states are desired .",
    "an even more interesting situation occurs when both @xmath5 and @xmath4 beams are simultaneously present .",
    "the steady state solution for the atom then is not a simple statistical mixture of the two trap states but a three - component cpt state , given by @xcite    @xmath35    where states @xmath36 and @xmath37 are as describes above and    @xmath38    this implies that a superposition of the two qubit states can be prepared as @xmath39 by switching on both beams simultaneously .",
    "further , any desired @xmath40 value in the above superposition can be obtained by varying the ratio between the rabi frequencies @xmath41 .",
    "if both beams are derived from a single source as shown in figure 1a , then the ratio is easily manipulated by rotating the halfwave plate .",
    "this divides the intensity between @xmath5 and @xmath4 beams in such a way that @xmath42 is zero when @xmath43 is maximum and vice versa and hence the angle @xmath40 can be varied from @xmath11 to @xmath44 . since rabi frequencies are normally complex quantities , a phase difference @xmath45 can be obtained between them .",
    "the above scheme allows us to prepare the atom in two qubit states @xmath46 or @xmath47 as well as any desired superposition state of the two , with certain distinct advantages .",
    "( i ) both these states as well as their superposition are cpt states .",
    "therefore , once prepared , the states do not interact with the preparing laser , which eliminates a need for precise control of the ontime of the laser .",
    "( ii ) decoherence due to spontaneous emission is eliminated since all these states are made up of only ground states .",
    "( iii ) cpt preparation is always the endpoint of the process and therefore the cpt state will be reached even if there are small variations in the intensity and frequency of the lasers involved .",
    "the state preparation is therefore robust and certain .",
    "( iv ) the state preparation involves only cw beams and does not require any complex pulse shaping schemes .",
    "( v ) since it does not involve single photon processes , lasers with nominally high intensity can be used .",
    "this would allow very precise control of phase @xmath45 while allowing fluctuations in the intensity .",
    "( vi ) any desired superposition , denoting any bloch vector can be prepared by simply varying the intensity ratio between two laser beams . due to all of above",
    ", the configuration allows a robust and reliable preparation of two qubit states and its superposition and also the method of state preparation is very easy . in the following sections , methods of performing single qubit and two - qubit operations are discussed .",
    "the atom prepared in state @xmath46 above can be flipped onto state @xmath47 by simply switching switching on the @xmath5 beam and switching to the @xmath4 beam will prepare flip the atom back to state @xmath46 .",
    "but this process involves spontaneous emission from states @xmath48 and hence is an incoherent process .",
    "this technique therefore is not a proper bit - flip operation . however a coherent bit - flip operation can still be operated using a process very similar to the stirap process as suggested by gaubatz and coworkers @xcite .",
    "this process involves varying parameters of a cpt state , adiabatically slowly such that the atom is always in the cpt state , even as the state itself evolves from an initial state to the final state . in this case , the three component cpt state ( [ threetrap ] ) is made to evolve between @xmath36 and @xmath49 by varying the angle @xmath40 .",
    "if this variation is achieved adiabatically slowly the atom is always in the state ( [ state2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath40 can be varied by varying the ratio between the rabi frequencies @xmath41 .",
    "this ratio can be varied by varying the amplitudes @xmath4 and @xmath5 . since the rabi frequencies are related to the amplitude @xmath50 .",
    "if the experimental setup is as suggested in figure 1a , rotation of the halfwaveplate ensures that the total intensity is redistributed between @xmath4 and @xmath5 beams such that @xmath24 when @xmath5 is maximum ( @xmath51 ) and vice versa ( @xmath52 ) . for any other position of the halfwaveplate",
    ", the value of @xmath5 and @xmath4 are appropriately distributed in such a way that @xmath53 . by rotating the halfwaveplate",
    ", the atom is flipped between the two bits coherently .",
    "two - qubit operations can be obtained on this system in three different methods .",
    "all the three exploit a dipole - dipole interaction between two atoms in the cpt states , but between magnetic spins instead of electric dipoles , as described below .    in presence of a static magnetic field @xmath54 ,",
    "the atomic spin vectors orient themselves such that the projection of the spin vector onto the magnetic field vector is equal to the magnitude of the magnetic quantum number m@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the state @xmath46 , with is m@xmath55 orients perpendicular to this field and the state @xmath47 orients along the field since its constituent components have m@xmath56 .",
    "further , these spin vectors precess about the magnetic field vector with a larmor frequency @xmath57 the field strength .",
    "an additional oscillatory magnetic field @xmath58 , at the frequency @xmath59 , applied perpendicular to @xmath60 will now cause an energy shift so that the atoms flip from one one m@xmath10 state to another @xcite .",
    "if two such atoms are considered , then the energy of the atom - pair in presence of @xmath60 is as shown in figure 2a , with each spin flip transition separated by an energy @xmath61 .",
    "however , if these atoms are brought sufficiently close together , there exists an interaction between two spin -dipoles of the nature @xmath62 , which will result in an interaction potential @xcite    @xmath63    here @xmath64 is the normal distance between the two spin states and @xmath65 the angle between them .",
    "@xmath66 is the permittivity of free space and the ratio @xmath67 is the scaling factor required to change from cgs to mks units .",
    "this interaction causes a mixing of the pair states @xmath68 and @xmath69 and also causes a shift of the state @xmath70 as shown in figure 2b",
    ". the oscillatory magnetic field oscillating at larmor frequency will no longer be in resonance with the spin flip operation .",
    "this unequal shift is due to the fact that the angle @xmath65 between the two spins is 0 if both atoms are in same state and is equal to @xmath44 if the two atoms are in different state .",
    "the shift is equal to @xmath71 where @xmath72 which is the case when @xmath73 in equation ( [ dipoledipole ] ) .",
    "a controlled - phase operation can now be performed in a manner similar as suggested by gavin brennen and coworkers @xcite , except for using magnetic dipoles instead of electric dipoles .",
    "the two atoms are brought close and a short pulse of oscillating magnetic field of frequency @xmath74 and a mccall - hahn area of 2@xmath75 is applied .",
    "the pulse will not have any effect if the atom pairs are in state @xmath76 or in mixed state @xmath77 .",
    "if it is instead in @xmath78 then the pair gets pumped to state @xmath79 and back , but this cyclic transformation brings about an additional phase @xmath75 @xcite . when pulled apart , @xmath69 would have acquired a @xmath75 phase .",
    "if instead the state was already in @xmath80 , the phase factor is already present .",
    "the controlled phase gate can also be obtained here in the same manner as given by igor ryabstev and coworkers for rydberg atoms@xcite . in this method , the two atoms are brought closer .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction causes a time dependent state that periodically moves from @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath81 the state returns back to original state , but with an additional @xmath75 phase after every period of @xmath82 .",
    "the phase gate therefore involves bringing the two atoms closer and hold it for a period @xmath82 and taking it apart , by which time , only the state @xmath68 would have acquired a phase .",
    "although both above methods are equally useful , they both suffer from a serious drawback .",
    "the phase shift happens with equal certainty whether the atoms are in state @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "in other words , the above protocols do not distinguish between control and logic qubit atoms .",
    "one suggested workaround for this is to use two different atoms , both of which exhibit similar configurations .",
    "another atom that shows similar zeeman sublevel structure as @xmath0rb is sodium , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 triplets .",
    "that ensures that all the state preparation and qubit operations described above are valid for sodium atoms as well .",
    "the behaviour of the sodium atoms under above operations will be identical to that described above for @xmath0rb , except for a different larmor frequency .",
    "the two - qubit operation can now be adopted using @xmath0rb and sodium atoms together , with one of them as the logic qubit and the other as the control qubit .",
    "for the present , let sodium be the control atom and @xmath0rb the logic atom , though the other way around is equally appropriate .",
    "since their gyromagnetic ratios are different , the larmor precession frequencies are also different and therefore , the spin flip resonances are @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively as shown in figure 3a .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction between one sodium and one @xmath0rb atom will lead to energy shifts , but not a mixing , with the energy shifts being @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are their respective gyromagnetic ratios .",
    "the shifted energy schematic is shown in figure 3b , where the gray lines show the original position of the energy level .    since the transitions @xmath90 and @xmath91 transitions are shifted by different energies , it is easy to distinguish them and operate that 2@xmath75 pulse which brings about the desired transition . in other words ,",
    "if the first atom is the control and the second atom is the logic , then @xmath92 operation can be obtained by using a pulse of the frequency @xmath93 or @xmath94 transition can be obtained by using a pulse of the frequency @xmath95 . or a combination of the two pulses in a sequence can bring about a raman transition @xmath96 or vice versa , which is a controlled - swap operation .",
    "a few practical considerations requires to be carefully taken into account to use this scheme effectively .",
    "firstly , the state preparation is based on optical pumping and therefore some atoms may be lost to level @xmath97 during this process due to spontaneous emission . a repumping laser which pumps these atoms back into the main cycle",
    "will be needed for this .",
    "however , the bit flip operation involves an adiabatic variation of the state of the system from @xmath36 to @xmath49 without involving any of the excited states @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , this will not require a repump laser .",
    "secondly , the magnetic spin dipole interactions that are required here for two qubit operations are much weaker than the electric dipole interactions exploited in reference @xcite or @xcite .",
    "therefore the shift in energies will also be smaller .",
    "but the gyromagnetic ratios and hence the larmor frequencies are typically a few hundred khz per gauss for alkali atoms . the shift due to dipole - dipole interaction will also be in this order of magnitude and precise measurement of such quantities are feasible . further the shift is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance between the two atoms and hence can be increased by moving them closer .",
    "thirdly , the method involves optical lattices which can be moved independently so that the atoms are brought closer and taken apart .",
    "although this has been achieved in several laboratories , it is still bogged by technical difficulties .",
    "this is probably the biggest disadvantage of this scheme , especially when two different species of atoms such as sodium and rubidium have to be independently loaded onto two different lattices and then moved .",
    "it is shown that a @xmath0rb atom interacting with two lasers that couple its f=1 @xmath99 f=1 transition exhibits two trap states .",
    "these two trap states can be mapped onto two qubits @xmath47 and @xmath46 and can be used for quantum computation .",
    "both qubit states are trap states and are made up of only ground states . a three component trap state , which is a coherent superposition of these two trap state is also feasible .",
    "this means that the qubit state preparation is reliable , robust and free of decoherence due to spontaneous emissions .",
    "it is also shown that any desired bloch vector can be prepared out of qubit states and this is also a robust trap state .",
    "two - qubit operations such as controlled phase and controlled swap are shown feasible on this system . in short , a robust , reliable and easily available configuration is suggested for use in quantum computation .",
    "the next question that needs to be examined is the effect of one and two - qubit operations on the superposition state ( [ state2 ] ) , which will be addressed somewhere else .",
    "several useful discussions led to fine tuning of this work .",
