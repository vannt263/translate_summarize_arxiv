    "supernova ( sn ) 2010jl was discovered on 2010 nov 3.5 ( ut ) at a magnitude of 13.5 @xcite , and brightened to magnitude 12.9 over the next day , showing that it was discovered at an early phase .",
    "pre - discovery observations indicate an explosion date in early october 2010 @xcite .",
    "spectra on 2010 nov 5 show that it is a type iin event @xcite .",
    "the apparent magnitude is the brightest for a type iin sn since sn 1998s .",
    "sn 2010jl is associated with the galaxy ugc 5189a at a distance of 50 mpc ( @xmath5 ) , implying that sn 2010jl belongs to the class of luminous sne iin with an absolute magnitude @xmath6 . _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "images of the site of the sn taken a decade before the sn indicate that , unless there is a chance coincidence of a bright star with the sn site , the progenitor star had an initial mass @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "optical spectra give evidence for a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) expanding around the progenitor star with speeds of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the host galaxy is of low metallicity , supporting the emerging trend that luminous sne occur in low metallicity environments .",
    "they determine the metallicity @xmath9 of the sn region to be @xmath10 .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations showed a significant infrared ( ir ) excess in sn 2010jl , indicating either new dust formation or the heating of circumstellar dust in an ir echo @xcite .",
    "@xcite attributed the ir excess to pre - existing dust and inferred a massive csm around sn 2010jl , possibly suggesting a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) like progenitor .",
    "@xcite found signatures of new dust formation in the post - shock shell of sn 2010jl from their multi - epoch spectra .",
    "while a significant ir excess is present , the sn does not show large reddening , indicating that the dust does not have a spherically symmetric distribution about the sn @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ on - board x - ray telescope ( xrt ) detected x - rays from sn 2010jl on 2010 nov @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "assuming a temperature of 10 kev and a galactic absorption column of @xmath12 @xmath2 , @xcite obtained an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 in the @xmath3 kev band .",
    "after the detection of sn 2010jl with the _ swift_-xrt , we triggered _ chandra _ observations of the sn at two epochs , in dec 2010 and oct 2011 , and we present the results here ( section  [ observation ] ) .",
    "we discuss the significant changes in the two _ chandra _ observations taken 10 months apart in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the _ swift _ detection of sn 2010jl allowed us to trigger our approved _",
    "chandra _ cycle 11 program in dec 2010 .",
    "we again observed sn 2010jl in oct 2011 under cycle 13 of _ chandra_. the first observation ( figure [ first ] ) took place under the proposal # 11500430 starting 2010 dec 7 at 04:22:53 hrs ( ut ) for an exposure of 19.05 ks and then on 2010 dec 8 at 00:50:20 hrs ( ut ) for a 21.05 ks exposure . the observations were taken with the acis - s without grating in a vfaint mode .",
    "a total of 39.58 ks exposure time was used in the data analysis and 468 counts were obtained with a count rate of @xmath15 cts s@xmath14 .",
    "the second set of observations ( figure [ second ] ) took place under our proposal # 13500593 starting on 2011 oct 17 at 20:25:09 hrs ( ut ) for an exposure of 41.04 ks .",
    "the observations were again taken with the acis - s in the vfaint mode with grating none . in a total of 40.51 ks",
    "usable exposure time , we obtained 1342 total counts , i.e. a count rate of @xmath16 cts s@xmath14 .",
    "we extracted the spectra using ciao software and used heasoft to carry out the spectral analysis .",
    "as can be seen in figures [ first ] and [ second ] , the normalized count rate is higher in the oct 2011 spectra .",
    "this does not necessarily indicate higher intrinsic emission from the sn at the later time , because the count rates are absorbed count rates and the unabsorbed emission depends on the intervening column density , which may change . in the @xmath17 kev range ,",
    "the fluorescent 6.4 kev fe line is present in the first spectrum but not the second ( figure  [ comparison ] ) . here",
    "we carry out a detailed spectral analysis of both spectra and determine the significance of various emission components along with the fe 6.4  kev line .      for the december 2010 spectrum , we first fit the high temperature component in the @xmath18  kev energy range , where most of the emission in the _ chandra _ energy band lies .",
    "we fit the spectrum in this range with an absorbed mekal model @xcite with metallicity @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the preferred mekal temperature always hit the upper bound of the temperature allowed in the mekal model , i.e.  79.9 kev .",
    "the column density is also very high , with @xmath20 @xmath2 .",
    "since the temperature in the best fit models seems high , we checked for the possibility of non - thermal x - ray emission and fit a power law model .",
    "the column density in this fit is consistent with that of the mekal model ; however the photon index is too small to be physically plausible ( @xmath21 ) , and we disfavor the non - thermal model",
    ".    when we plot the confidence contours of @xmath22 versus @xmath23 , the column density in our fits is well constrained , but the upper bound of the temperature is not constrained ( figure  [ confidence1 ] ) .",
    "we established a lower bound on the temperature by assuming a value and finding the goodness of fit ; @xmath24 kev gives a good fit with acceptable @xmath25 value , but not lower values .",
    "thus 8  kev is a lower limit on the temperature of the main x - ray emission component of the sn . for the lower temperature component in the @xmath26 kev range , we fix the absorption column to the galactic value of @xmath27 @xmath2",
    "since the absorption column for this component is very poorly constrained .",
    "this component is best fit with a temperature of @xmath28  kev or a power law with @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ first ] shows the best fit to the _ chandra _ spectrum taken between 2010 dec 07.18 ut and 2010 dec 08.03 ut , and the best fits are tabulated in table  [ tab : xspec ] .",
    "our complete model is the absorption@xmath30powerlaw @xmath31 absorption@xmath30(mekal@xmath31gaussian ) .",
    "97.9% of the total unabsorbed flux in the _ chandra _ band is carried by the high temperature component .",
    "the fe 6.4 kev line carries 1.7% of the total flux while the low-@xmath22 component has only 0.4% of the total flux .",
    "the rest energy of the fe line is @xmath32 kev , which is consistent with the k@xmath33 line .",
    "the equivalent width of the line is @xmath34 kev .",
    "the _ chandra _ spectrum taken between 2011 oct @xmath35  ut is different from the first epoch spectrum .",
    "we first fit the high temperature component between @xmath18 kev .",
    "the temperature in this case also reaches the mekal model upper limit of 79.9 kev . to consider the possibility of non - thermal emission",
    ", we fit a power law to the spectrum .",
    "however , the power law fit to this component yields a photon index of @xmath36 , which is implausible .    in this spectrum ,",
    "the column density has decreased by a factor of three ; the best fit column density for @xmath37 is @xmath38 @xmath2 .",
    "the fe 6.4 kev line is not present , but the low - temperature component is there .",
    "because of few data points and a large uncertainty in the column density in this component , we again fix the column density to the galactic value .",
    "when we fit the low temperature component with a thermal plasma or a power law model , it fits with a temperature of @xmath39  kev or a power law of @xmath40 .",
    "however , another component is still required by the data .",
    "when we try to fit this component using the same column density as that of the main emission component , we find @xmath41 kev and a very high unabsorbed luminosity @xmath42 erg s@xmath14 , which is implausible .",
    "thus we try to fit this component with an independently varying column density .",
    "the column density associated with this component is around 1/4 that of the high @xmath22 component column density .",
    "this gives a reasonable and physically plausible component and indicates that the flux is this component is @xmath43% of the total emission .",
    "thus , in this spectrum , we have three components : a high-@xmath22 high-@xmath44 component , a high-@xmath22 low-@xmath44 component and a low-@xmath22 component .",
    "although the preferred temperature again reaches the upper bound allowed by the mekal model , the error determination shows that there is no upper bound and the lower bound to the temperature is 12  kev .",
    "our final model thus is absorption@xmath30power law @xmath31 absorption@xmath30mekal+absorption@xmath30mekal .",
    "figure [ second ] shows the best fit to the _ chandra _ october 2011 spectrum .",
    "table [ tab : xspec ] lists the models and best fit parameters . in this case ,",
    "81.1% of the unabsorbed flux is carried by the high column density component , 18.2% by the lower-@xmath22 component and 0.7% is carried by the power law component .",
    "here we highlight the main differences between the december 2010 and october 2011 spectra and discuss the best fit models and their implications .",
    "the lower limits on the temperature for the two spectra are 8  kev and 12  kev , respectively , showing that a hot component is present .",
    "the column densities of the main x - ray emission component ( high-@xmath22 component ) are high at both epochs .",
    "the column densities at the first and second epochs are @xmath45 @xmath2 and @xmath46 @xmath2 ( for a metallicity of @xmath47 ) , respectively .",
    "these are 3000 times and 1000 times higher than the galactic column density ( @xmath48 @xmath2 ) . the high value and variability of @xmath22 point to an origin in the circumstellar medium .",
    "the excess column density to the x - ray emission is not accompanied by high extinction to the supernova , showing that the column is probably due to mass loss near the forward shock wave where any dust has been evaporated .",
    "this is the first time that external circumstellar x - ray absorption has been clearly observed in a supernova .    assuming 2010 oct 10 as the date of explosion @xcite , the epochs of the two _ chandra _ observations are 59 and 373 days , respectively .",
    "the @xmath3 kev absorbed flux at the second epoch ( @xmath49 erg @xmath2 s@xmath14 ) is higher than that at the first epoch ( @xmath50 erg @xmath2 s@xmath14 ) , but this is due to the lower absorption column density at the second epoch .",
    "the actual unabsorbed emission from the sn is constant within @xmath51% . at the two epochs ,",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity in the @xmath3  kev band is @xmath52 , placing sn 2010jl among the most luminous x - ray supernovae yet observed .",
    "table 1 of @xcite shows that the only other sne with comparable luminosities are type iin events or gamma - ray burst associated sne at early times .",
    "the luminosity of @xmath53 found by _ swift _ on 2010 nov 5 @xcite is revised to a value close to our _ chandra _ result if @xmath54 @xmath2 is assumed . in the thermal interpretation",
    ", the shock velocity can be deduced as @xmath55^{1/2}=7700(kt/80{\\rm~kev})^{1/2}$ ] km s@xmath14 , where @xmath56 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath57 is the mean particle weight .",
    "a lower limit of 10 kev for the temperature puts a lower limit of the 2700  km  s@xmath14 on the shock speed .    in comparing the observed luminosity to a thermal emission model to find the physical parameters",
    ", we note that our measurements give the spectral luminosity , not the total luminosity .",
    "we use equation ( 3.11 ) of @xcite for the luminosity , adjusting to an observed photon energy of @xmath58 kev rather than @xmath59 kev ; the gaunt factor is increased to @xmath60 . for the preshock column density , we use equation ( 4.1 ) of @xcite",
    "these expressions allow for a variation of the preshock density @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a constant .",
    "the value @xmath63 corresponds to a steady wind and is commonly used , but implies stronger evolution than we observe in sn 2010jl .",
    "if the circumstellar medium around sn 2010jl is due to some presupernova eruptive event , deviation from @xmath63 is plausible .",
    "another parameter is @xmath64 , determined by the expansion of the supernova shock @xmath65 .",
    "for the plausible value @xmath66 , we find that @xmath67 give a reasonable representation of the luminosity and @xmath22 evolution .",
    "the implied value of the mass loss rate @xmath68 , normalized to @xmath69 cm , is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the preshock wind velocity in units of @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath75 at the first epoch .",
    "the high temperature implies that we are observing the forward shock region .",
    "the physical conditions are such that the forward shock front is close to the cooling regime @xcite . in this case",
    ", the luminosity of the forward shock is expected to dominate that from the reverse shock and the reverse shock emission may be absorbed by a cooled shell , which explains the lack of observational evidence for reverse shock emission .    in modeling the x - ray absorption in sn 2010jl",
    "we have assumed that the absorbing gas is not fully ionized .",
    "if the circumstellar gas is photoionized by the x - ray emission , the absorption is reduced ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "taking an x - ray luminosity of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( at @xmath78 cm ) , the ionization parameter is @xmath79 ; a similar value is obtained taking @xmath80 @xmath2 and @xmath81 cm for the early epoch .",
    "this is in a regime where the cno elements may be completely ionized , but fe is not @xcite .",
    "the cno elements absorb radiation at @xmath82 kev , so there is the possibility of getting enhanced emission around that energy , as is observed in sn 2010jl .",
    "we investigated this possibility by running various cases with the cloudy photoionization code @xcite .",
    "it is possible to obtain cases in which there is a peak at @xmath82 kev , but they had too little absorption in the @xmath83 kev range .",
    "we thus favor a background source origin for the 1 kev emission , especially because the emission remains fairly constant over the 2 epochs .",
    "the value of @xmath22 in dec 2010 implies that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the electron scattering optical depth through the preshock wind .",
    "the h@xmath33 line at that time showed roughly symmetric broad wings @xcite that are probably best explained by electron scattering in the slow moving wind .",
    "@xcite estimated that the broad features observed in sn 1998s require @xmath86 .",
    "the required optical depth may be several times that observed along the line of sight to the x - ray emission , which could be the result of asymmetry .",
    "@xcite found that the column density of dust needed for observed infrared emission is larger than that on the line of sight to the supernova , although this is at larger radii .",
    "the dec 2010 spectrum shows a 6.4 kev feature ( figure [ comparison ] ) , which is identified with the narrow k@xmath33 iron line .",
    "since the 6.4 kev fe line arises from neutral or low ionized iron ( fei to fexi ) , it supports our finding that the radiation field is not able to completely ionize the circumstellar gas .",
    "a simple estimate of the expected equivalent width of the fe line ( @xmath87 ) can be obtained from equation ( 5 ) of @xcite : @xmath88 kev , where @xmath89 is the circumstellar column density in units of @xmath90 cm@xmath14 and the line production is due to a central x - ray source in a spherical shell .",
    "the expression assumes a flux spectrum @xmath92 ; @xmath93 , which is more appropriate to the hot thermal spectrum here , increases @xmath87 by 1.2 .",
    "the prediction for the metallicity in our case in the early spectrum is @xmath94 kev , and the observed value is 0.2 kev . in view of the uncertainties in the model and the observations",
    ", we consider the agreement to be adequate . at the second epoch , @xmath22 is smaller by a factor of 3 , so the strength of the fe line should be correspondingly smaller ; this is consistent with the nondetection of the line .",
    "the problem with this picture is that it assumes the fe is in the low ionization stages that produce the k@xmath33 line ; this requires an ionization parameter @xmath95 @xcite , which is below the inferred value .",
    "one possibility is that the circumstellar gas is clumped , with a density @xmath96 times the average ; another is that the k line emission is from dense gas that is not along the line of sight .",
    "a thermal fit to the low temperature component implies an absorbing column density of @xmath97 @xmath2 , much less than the column to the hot component and consistent with the galactic column density within the errors .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the cooler x - rays come from slow cloud shocks in the clumpy csm or from the reverse shocks .",
    "the component is also present in the second epoch .",
    "it could arise from a presupernova mass loss event or from an unrelated source in the direction of the supernova .",
    "the components are best fit with either a thermal component ( @xmath98 kev ) or a power law with @xmath99 .",
    "the luminosities of this component in the dec 2010 and oct 2011 spectra are @xmath100 erg s@xmath14 and @xmath101 erg s@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the luminosity range and the power law index are compatible with a background ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) , which can typically be described by an absorbed power law spectrum @xcite .",
    "since the error in the flux determination is between @xmath51% , a factor of 1.4 change in the luminosity at the two epochs is consistent with a constant flux .",
    "thus we attribute this component to a background source , most likely an ulx , which is associated with the blue excess emission region seen in the pre - sn hst images @xcite .",
    "we examined the heasarc archives for useful limits on such a source , but did not find any .",
    "the december 2010 spectrum has only one temperature component associated with the high column density .",
    "however , in the october 2011 spectrum , there are two temperature components associated with a high column density , one with temperature @xmath0 kev and another with temperature 1.1 kev .",
    "the lower temperature component fits with 1/4 the column density of the high temperature component .",
    "the fact that the component is absent at the first epoch suggests that it is related to the supernova emission .",
    "we examined the possibility that the emission is the result of reduced absorption due to photoionization of the absorbing material , in particular , that lighter atoms are ionized but heavier atoms are not .",
    "however , we were not able to reproduce the observed emission and the source of this emission remains uncertain .",
    "sn 2010jl is a special type iin supernova because we have been able to catch it in x - rays early on with as sensitive an instrument as _ chandra _ and trace the early x - ray evolution .",
    "we observe dramatic changes over two epochs separated by 10 months .",
    "for the first time we see clear evidence of external csm absorption in a supernova .",
    "we also find that the csm is not fully photoionized by the sn emission , the sn is very luminous in x - rays , and the temperature of the emitting gas is @xmath0 kev .",
