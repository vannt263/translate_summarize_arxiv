    "several mechanisms have been suggested to describe photoproduction of @xmath0  mesons @xmath110 for the description of the _ elastic _ ( or _ exclusive _ ) process where @xmath111 , a diffractive mechanism has been proposed by donnachie and landshoff  @xcite .",

    "the variables used for the description of @xmath0 photoproduction at hera are :    @xmath126    with the 4-momenta @xmath127 and @xmath128 of the incoming proton and positron , @xmath129 of the scattered positron , @xmath130 of the exchanged photon , and @xmath131 of the system x , which is identical to the proton for elastic @xmath0  production .",

    "since the photon flux decreases rapidly with @xmath109 and @xmath132 , the weak @xmath109 and @xmath132 dependences of @xmath152 play only a minor role and the photoproduction cross section   @xmath153 can in first approximation be identified with @xmath152 .",
