    "the discovery of the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) by schramm  @xcite opened a rigorous way to study conformally invariant systems .",
    "some well - known results from physics literature were proved  @xcite , new formulas were also discovered  @xcite .",
    "notably , conformal invariance was proved for percolation clusters  @xcite and for ising fortuin - kasteleyn and spin clusters  @xcite .",
    "one of the key steps in these proofs is to find an appropriate discrete holomorphic parafermion for the critical interface .",
    "relating the holomorphic parafermion to a specific property of the critical curve , one can conjecture and then prove that the continuum limit of the interface is sle .",
    "different methods of finding discrete holomorphic parafermions for statistical models and their relation to integrability were investigated by cardy and collaborators in a series of papers @xcite . in some cases @xcite the relation of the parafermion to a critical interface is known , and so there are conjectures on the sle corresponding to the continuum limit of the interfaces , but in other cases @xcite the corresponding interfaces are not known and so there is no known sle .",
    "one of the interesting models where neither discrete holomorphic parafermions nor corresponding sle were known up to now is the ashkin - teller ( at ) model  @xcite ( the phase diagram is described in  @xcite ) . from the conformal field theory ( cft )",
    "point of view , the at model is interesting because it has a critical line with constant central charge @xmath3 and changing critical exponents . although it is possible to define different kinds of critical interfaces for the at model @xcite , it is shown numerically  @xcite that some of the natural possibilities are not related to simple sle s . recently , in  @xcite , the at model was studied on iso - radial graphs , the critical surfaces on generic iso - radial graphs were found , and discrete holomorphic parafermions were defined at some particular points of the critical line , by using algebraic relations between spin and disorder variables . in the present paper , we introduce discrete holomorphic parafermions all over the critical line , without using these relations directly .",
    "the idea is to map some particular interfaces to the @xmath0 model on the square lattice , and then to exploit some of the results of  @xcite .",
    "our main conjecture is based on the continuum gaussian theory for the solid - on - solid ( sos ) model associated to the at model , and on the known relation between this theory and @xmath4  @xcite : in the upper half - plane , we expect the curve created by the insertion of a parafermion at the origin and at infinity to have the statistics of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coupling constant of the gaussian theory ( see section  [ sec : sle ] for details on the definition of @xmath6 ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we recall the definition of the at model on the square lattice and its mapping to the staggered six - vertex model . in section  3 ,",
    "the six - vertex model is mapped to the @xmath0 model , and , using this mapping , we find a lattice holomorphic parafermion for the at model all over the critical integrable surface . in section  4 ,",
    "we formulate conjectures on the relation of our interfaces to sle .",
    "section  5 is dedicated to bulk critical exponents in the @xmath0 loop model associated to the at model .",
    "the results are checked numerically by transfer - matrix diagonalisation .",
    "the ashkin - teller model can be defined on any graph , but , for clarity , we will restrict to the square lattice in this paper . at each vertex @xmath7 of the lattice , we define two spin variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which can take individually the values @xmath10 .",
    "a spin configuration @xmath11 gets the boltzmann weight : @xmath12 \\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) if @xmath15 is a horizontal ( resp .",
    "vertical ) bond .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the averaging with respect to the normalized boltzmann weights @xmath17 , where @xmath18 let us recall the graphical expansion of this partition function  @xcite . introducing the change of variables @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , the edge interaction can be written as : @xmath21 \\,.\\ ] ] first , we fix the values of the @xmath22 spins , which define a domain - wall ( dw ) configuration on the edges of the dual lattice .",
    "let @xmath15 be an edge of the original lattice .",
    "if @xmath15 is crossed by a dw , then it gets a weight @xmath23 . if not , then it gets the weight @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "we depict the first term as an empty edge , and the second one as an occupied edge .",
    "thus the partition function reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( resp .",
    "@xmath27 ) is a subgraph of the original ( resp .",
    "dual ) lattice , all vertices in @xmath26 and @xmath27 must have even degree , @xmath26 and @xmath27 must not intersect each other , and @xmath28 are the numbers of horizontal and vertical bonds of @xmath26 . an example configuration is shown in figure  [ fig : clusters ] .",
    "spins are depicted in thick , black lines , and high - temperature polygons for the @xmath8 variables , in thick , grey lines .",
    "crossings between the black and grey clusters are forbidden . ]",
    "one interest of this graphical expansion is that it maps to the six - vertex model on the medial lattice variables .",
    "however , in the present paper , we focus on the mapping to the six - vertex model because the latter has a known discrete holomorphic parafermion . ] . the correspondence is given in figure  [ fig : at-6v ] .",
    "the ashkin - teller model is critical when the six - vertex model is not staggered .",
    "the weights of the six - vertex model with parameter @xmath29 can be parameterised as @xmath30 this corresponds to the weights of the at model : @xmath31 the variable @xmath32 is a spectral parameter , whereas @xmath33 determines the universality class .",
    "the isotropic point is at @xmath34 .",
    "some special values are : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , corresponding to the four - state potts , @xmath39 fateev - zamolodchikov @xcite , ising@xmath40ising and xy models .",
    "when @xmath33 is varied , the central charge remains constant @xmath3 , but the critical exponents change .",
    "for example , the correlation exponent is @xmath41    more generally , it was shown in ref  @xcite that the critical weights of the at models on any baxter lattice are given by  ",
    ", with the spectral parameter @xmath32 related to the angle of @xmath42 the rhombic faces by @xmath43 . in the next section , we will describe a discrete holomorphic parafermion in the critical square - lattice at model .",
    "note that this parafermion is also present for the at model on a baxter lattice , at the critical value of the boltzmann weights .        .",
    "the arrows of six - vertex model live on the edges of the medial lattice . ]",
    "in  @xcite , using the spin variables of the at model , discrete holomorphic parafermions were found at some particular points of the critical line , namely at the four - state potts , fz , ising and xy points . in this section",
    ", we will exhibit _ another _ discrete holomorphic parafermion all along the critical line of the at model .",
    "this parafermion is defined in the loop formulation of the at model .",
    "the key idea is to use the chain of mappings : @xmath44 the first mapping is described in section  [ sec : at - model ] , and the second one is given , for example , in  @xcite . for completeness , we recall it in figure  [ fig:6v - on ] .",
    "the resulting loop model has seven possible vertices , and each closed loop has a boltzmann weight @xmath45 .",
    "we will denote this model the @xmath0 model for short .     loop model .",
    "the correspondence between the arrow and loop vertices shown here is valid on the sublattice 1 of the medial lattice . on the sublattice 2",
    ", the same correspondence holds , with all arrows reversed . ]",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the @xmath0 model , with weights given by  , possesses a discrete holomorphic parafermion @xmath46 , associated to the insertion of one path at point @xmath47 .",
    "the spin @xmath48 of this parafermion is related to the parameter @xmath33 by : @xmath49    in terms of the at model , @xmath50 is defined on the edges of the covering lattice ( the union of the original and dual lattices ) . if @xmath47 denotes an edge of this lattice , the operator @xmath46 inserts a @xmath51 variable and a @xmath52 dw at the ends of the edge @xmath47 .",
    "the two - point function @xmath53 also contains a non - local phase factor given by the simultaneous winding of the @xmath52 dw and @xmath51 cluster between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we might decompose symbolically @xmath50 into three factors : @xmath56 where @xmath42 is a contribution to the winding angle ( see above ) and @xmath57 creates a @xmath52 domain wall .",
    "let us interpret the effect of @xmath50 on the at model , when inserted at two boundary points @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in this situation , there must be , in the @xmath0 model , a path @xmath60 going from @xmath58 to @xmath59 ( see figure  [ fig : domain ] ) .",
    "the occupied area adjacent to @xmath60 is bounded on one side by a @xmath52 domain wall , and on the other side by a @xmath51 high - temperature cluster .",
    "so @xmath61 corresponds to the two - point function @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes the averaging with boltzmann weights @xmath17 and the following boundary conditions ( denoted bc@xmath64 ) : free boundary conditions for @xmath51 and @xmath65 on one arc @xmath66 of the boundary , @xmath67 on the other arc .",
    "we can also think of boundary conditions which allow the path @xmath60 to end anywhere in a given interval of the boundary .",
    "let @xmath68 be three marked points on the boundary .",
    "we consider the two - point function @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the boltzmann average with the following boundary conditions : free bc for @xmath51 , @xmath71 on @xmath66 and @xmath72 , @xmath67 on @xmath73 . in the @xmath0 model , this forces a path @xmath60 to go from @xmath58 to a point on @xmath72 , as shown in figure  [ fig : domain ] .",
    "we call these boundary conditions bc@xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath57 is viewed as a boundary - condition changing operator , the correlation function @xmath75 can be written as a three - point function , reflecting explicitly the role of point @xmath76 : @xmath77    , defined on a domain @xmath78 with boundary conditions bc@xmath64 ( left ) and bc@xmath74 ( right ) . in both cases , closed loops may be present around @xmath60 . ]",
    "the six - vertex model can be transformed into an sos model by introducing height variables @xmath79 on the faces of the medial lattice , so that two neighbouring @xmath79 s differ by @xmath80 , the highest being on the left of each arrow .",
    "the sos model renormalises to a gaussian theory with action @xmath81    when the at model is defined on a system with one or more periodic directions ( _ e.g. _ , a torus or a cylinder ) , the height @xmath79 is only well - defined up to the identifications @xmath82 .",
    "the first corresponds to a height defect around one direction of the system , while the second is a ` twist ' induced by an odd number of dw s winding around the system  @xcite .",
    "the theory with action   and the above identifications is called the @xmath83-orbifold of the compact boson . however , in this section , we will be dealing only with simply - connected domains , so the sos configurations are always well - defined without any identification , and the continuum limit is simply the gaussian model  .    in the case of boundary conditions",
    "bc@xmath64 , the presence of the path @xmath60 induces a height gap at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "so we expect the sos model to be a free field with dirichlet bc , and boundary values @xmath84 on one arc , @xmath85 on the other arc .",
    "since the dw and high - t cluster play the same role at the critical point , we must have @xmath86 .",
    "schramm and sheffield have shown  @xcite that the contour line in such a model is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is a universal constant .",
    "now , we use the results of  @xcite : when a consistent normalisation is chosen for @xmath79 , we have @xmath90 and the operator inserting the height gap @xmath91 has conformal dimension",
    "@xmath92 comparing to the spin   of the parafermion @xmath93 , we obtain @xmath94 , and so we conjecture that the curve @xmath60 has the statistics of @xmath5 .",
    "in this section , we derive the bulk exponents for watermelon correlation functions in the @xmath0 model , and give numerical results on some of these exponents .",
    "the @xmath0 model is a peculiar loop model , where the central charge is fixed , but the critical exponents vary along the critical line .    to calculate bulk exponents , it is easiest to consider the loop model on a cylinder of circumference @xmath95 sites ( @xmath95 even ) . in this setting ,",
    "the model is described by the @xmath83-orbifold theory , and part of the conformal spectrum  @xcite is given by ` electromagnetic ' exponents @xmath96    in the transfer - matrix formalism , the @xmath97-leg watermelon exponent corresponds to the dominant eigenvalue in the sector with @xmath97 strands propagating along the cylinder . for a given @xmath97",
    ", there are several exponents , according to the parity of the sites where the @xmath97 strands sit . indeed , because of the staggering in the 6v/@xmath0 correspondence , strands sitting on an even ( resp .",
    "odd ) edge are oriented positively ( resp . negatively ) .",
    "each strand contributes a height defect of magnetic charge @xmath98 , so if we write @xmath99 , where @xmath100 are the numbers of strands sitting on even and odd edges , the total magnetic charge is @xmath101 .",
    "hence , when @xmath102 , we get the exponent : @xmath103 in the special case @xmath104 , the total magnetic charge vanishes .",
    "our numerical results allow us to conjecture to exponent : @xmath105    the fractal dimension of the path @xmath60 is related to a two - leg watermelon exponent : @xmath106 . for @xmath107",
    ", there are two choices : @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the choice @xmath110 gives a fractal dimension @xmath111 , which is the correct value for @xmath4 .",
    "note that the direct numerical calculations of picco and santachiara  @xcite on the at model show that the fractal dimension of the boundaries of @xmath52 clusters is also @xmath112 .",
    "the central charge and the exponents of the loop model are extracted using the finite - size formulae for the eigenvalues @xmath113 of the transfer matrix  @xcite : @xmath114 in figures  [ fig : cc][fig : x6 ] , we depicted numerical data for the central charge , the thermal exponent and some watermelon exponents of the @xmath0 loop model .     on the whole critical line .",

    "in this paper we first found a discrete holomorphic parafermion for at model on the whole critical line . there may exist other discrete holomorphic parafermions in this model , but the one we describe is defined in terms of the @xmath0 loop model , which enables us to relate it to the sle model .",
    "our conjecture is compatible with our numerical calculations on the @xmath116 model .",
    "of course , more precise numerical calculation is needed to confirm our conjecture , such as the left - right schramm s formula .",
    "unfortunately , no schramm s formula for @xmath117 is known , but for @xmath118 it could be tractable , thanks to the relation with the gaussian free field .",
    "one can also think of monte - carlo simulation as it was done for the ising model  @xcite , and martingale arguments  @xcite .",
    "at the point @xmath119 , the at model is equivalent to two decoupled ising models .",
    "oshikawa and affleck have studied the boundary cft of this model , in relation to the @xmath83 orbifold theory  @xcite . in particular , our parafermionic observable @xmath50 , when inserted on the boundary , corresponds to a jump in dirichlet boundary conditions for the orbifold ( @xmath120 in the notations of  @xcite ) , together with the insertion of a @xmath51 operator .",
