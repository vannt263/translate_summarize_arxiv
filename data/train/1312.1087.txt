    "in the last few years , ir surveys have revealed a large dust content in quasar ( qso ) hosts at high redshift .",
    "recent atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) observations of systems at redshift z@xmath36 have shown the presence of large dust masses in qso hosts ( wang et al 2010 , 2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "their large far - infrared luminosities indicate that vigorous starbursts are present in the centre of these systems , ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 ) , with star formation rates of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , attempts have been carried on to constrain the dynamical properties of such systems ; in a few objects , the observed velocity maps have revealed a rotating , gravitationally bound gas component , which made possible an estimate of the dynamical mass ( walter et al .",
    "+ the considerable amounts of dust present in these objects is in contradiction with standard scenarios for interstellar dust formation .",
    "in fact , dust is expected to be present in little amounts at high redshift , if it is mostly produced in the cold atmospheres of evolved asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars on timescales of a few gyr ( matsuura et al .",
    "2009 ) . at these redshifts ,",
    "the universe is still young , and intermediate mass stars ( i.e. those with masses @xmath5 ) are still on the main sequence , hence they did not have enough time to produce considerable amounts of dust grains .",
    "this suggests that other dust production sources should be at play to justify the large dust masses observed in high - redshift galaxies , such as core - collapse supernovae ( todini & ferrara 2001 ; maiolino et al .",
    "2006 ) or dust accretion in molecular clouds ( pipino et al .",
    "all the observational constraints on the dust content of high - redshift qsos are of invaluable importance not only for constraining the relative importance of dust production mechanisms in the early universe , but also for probing the star formation histories ( sfhs ) and the mass buildup of spheroidal galaxies , a fundamental benchmark for galaxy formation theories .",
    "+ in this paper , we compare the available data of high - redshift qso hosts with chemical evolution models reproducing the dust content of local elliptical galaxies and their downsizing behaviour , in order to improve our understanding of dust production and of the main parameters regulating star formation ( sf ) in the early universe .",
    "our primary goal is to understand , through this comparison , whether the intense starbursts galaxies hosting high-@xmath0 qsos may be associated with the progenitors of local ellipticals .",
    "another aim of this work is to assess whether at high redshift , the star formation conditions are similar to those observed in local starbursts , which are known to obey to the popular schmidt ( 1959)-kennicutt ( 1998a ) relation , characterised by a marked correlation between the surface star formation rate ( sfr ) density and the molecular gas density .",
    "our models can also be useful tools to test the reliability of the dynamical mass estimates from co and cii emission , to understand the implications for the formation of such objects , for the duration of their starbursts , and finally , their abundance at high redshift and to explore the possibility to detect massive spheroids in the fields of present and future galaxy surveys .",

    "6 we draw our conclusions .",
    "we searched the literature and compiled to the best of our knowledge a list of all qsos at @xmath6 that have been observed in the far - ir .",
    "fifty - eight high - z qsos were found , either discovered by the sdss ( e.g. fan et al .",

    "the whole object list is shown in table  1 .",
    "most of the far - ir observations were performed by the iram max - planck millimeter bolometer array ( mambo , kreysa et al .",
    "1998 ) at 250 ghz ( 1.2 mm ) ; data from alma were also available for several objects .",
    "seventeen objects were detected , whose far - ir luminosity @xmath7 ( 42.5 - 122.5 @xmath8 ) was derived by fitting an optically thin grey - body to their far - ir spectral energy distribution ( e.g. wang et al .",
    "2008 ) . for most qsos the flux density at 250 ghz ( @xmath9 )",
    "is the only far - ir datapoint available : in these cases , a dust temperature of @xmath10  k and emissivity index @xmath11 were assumed ( e.g. wang et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 , 2011a , 2011b ; omont et al . 2013 ) , which are consistent with the average values observed in qso hosts at @xmath12 ( beelen et al .",
    "when @xmath7 was not directly available from the literature , we converted @xmath9 ( or its 3@xmath13 upper limit ) into @xmath7 by using the same assumptions on the gray - body parameters as described above .",

    "2013 ) : @xmath14 for an object at @xmath15 , which is also accurate to within 6% ( i.e. well below the statistical uncertainties ) for the whole redshift range of the sample .",
    "the sfr and dust mass @xmath16 were derived directly from @xmath7 and are mostly quoted in the literature papers ( see table 1 ) .",
    "whenever no such values were reported , we derived them from @xmath7 as follows : we integrated a grey - body spectrum with @xmath10  k and @xmath11 to convert the far - ir ( 42.5 - 122.5@xmath17 m ) to total - ir ( 8 - 1000@xmath17 m ) luminosity ( @xmath18 ) , and then used the relation @xmath19 ( kennicutt 1998b ) .",

    "[ sfr_to_lir ] is generally considered valid in starbursts with ages less than @xmath22 yr . in older systems or in galaxies characterised by low - star formation efficiency ,",
    "the conversion is uncertain due to the presence of evolved stars , contributing to dust heating , a different dust optical depth and the possible presence of an active galactic nucleus ( kennicutt 1998b ) .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the assumed stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , which plays a major role in models of stellar population synthesis , where it is used as weight for the theoretical simple stellar populations , then summed together to synthesize the luminosities of galaxies ( kennicutt 1998b ) .    as discussed later in sect .",
    "[ sect_imf ] , in general , a top - heavy imf , particularly rich in massive stars , gives place to a larger dust yield per stellar mass with respect to a standard salpeter ( 1955 ) imf ; at fixed star formation rate , this corresponds to a larger @xmath7 to sfr ratio ( see also rengarajan & mayya 2004 ) .",
    "the total dust mass @xmath16 is obtained from the relation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the planck function and @xmath25 is the dust absorption coefficient , we again assumed @xmath10  k and @xmath11 and @xmath26 @xmath27g@xmath28 at 125@xmath8 ( hildebrand 1983 ) as commonly used in the literature ( wang et al .",

    "2013 ) .",
    "we then searched for any information about the molecular and atomic gas content of these systems , as traced by the co emission line(s ) or the [ cii]158@xmath17 m emission line , respectively .",
    "observations of co lines were available for 17 objects ( either from iram pdb , evla , alma ) .",
    "twelve objects were detected , for which the molecular gas mass was derived by assuming @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the co intensity - to - gas mass conversion factor appropriate for ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , downes & solomon 1998 ) and @xmath32 is the luminosity of the co(1 - 0 ) line expressed as the velocity - integrated brightness temperature times the source area ( it has units of @xmath33 .",
    "when considering the co(1 - 0 ) line luminosity in units of @xmath34 , @xmath35 rather than @xmath32 ( which are linked by the relation @xmath36 ) , the relevant equation to convert co luminosities into molecular gas masses becomes : @xmath37    to get the luminosity of the co(1 - 0 ) line from the higher - order co transitions that are observed in these high - z qsos , the line ratios observed for the z=6.43 qso j1148 + 5251 are normally assumed ( riechers et al .",

    "this small systematic uncertainty is not likely to bias our results significantly .",
    "however , there are also several reasons for which the real dynamical masses could have been underestimated .",
    "first of all , in principle , the detected emission could allow one to trace only the brightest , innermost regions of the qso hosts .",
    "if , for some systems , a non - negligible amount of the gas were distributed around this central region and characterized by a low surface brightness , its detection would be problematic and the dynamical mass could be severely underestimated . for this reason , the different angular scales over which the gas and dust content are measured is a source of concern . indeed , most fir ( dust )",
    "measurements come from mambo at an angular resolution of 11 arcsec ( @xmath121 kpc at z=6 ) , while pdb and alma observations of cii and co lines have even sub - arcsec resolution .",
    "all measurements by mambo , however , are unresolved , and , in the few cases where both mambo and alma continuum observations were available together with alma cii emission ( wang et al . 2013 ) , it was shown that all the dust emission measured by mambo on scales @xmath122kpc is in reality co - spatial with the gas within a few kpc region .    however , recent co observations found no evidence for extended reservoirs of low - surface brightness molecular gas beyond the compact nuclear region of high-@xmath0 qso host galaxies ( riechers et al .",

    "a low surface brightness component is found in some submillimetre - selected galaxies at @xmath123 ( ivison et al .",

    "in addition , the conversion factor @xmath124 used to derive molecular gas masses from measured co emission is generally valid in star - forming galaxies similar to local ulirgs / starbursts ( downes & salomon 1998 ) . if a faint extended component were present , i.e. if a value for @xmath124 more appropriate for milky - way like galaxies were used , the estimated @xmath125 mass would be larger .",
    "as far as our systems are concerned , there is a possibility that the co emission could be more extended than the [ c ii ] emission .",

    "if this were the case of our systems , i.e. , by taking into account a substantial contribution of undetected gas in the gas mass estimate , the observed sfr-@xmath94 relation would move towards the region occupied by our standard models , without requiring a sf enhancement as for model m3e11s .",

    "if for some systems the atomic gas masses or the molecular gas masses represent underestimates of the total amount of star - forming gas , their sfr values and dust masses should not be compared with our intermediate mass model 1e11 , but with a more massive one .",
    "interestingly , for the systems characterised by detections , the dust masses and sfr values of our most massive model 1e12 are compatible with the observed ranges ; however , this model would be a faithful description of the high-@xmath0 qso hosts only if , for most of them , the gas and dynamical masses had been underestimated by a factor of @xmath131 .",

    "moreover , the denser environments and the different physical conditions of high - z starbursts could render the local calibrators unsuited to derive the sfr at high redshift ( fan et al .",

    "a very high star formation efficiency in large spheroids , such as the one assumed here for our model m3e11s , is explainable in galaxy evolution models taking into account a positive ( i.e. boosting sf ) feedback produced in the early stages of supermassive central black hole growth ( silk 2005 ; ciotti & ostriker 2007 ; pipino , silk & matteucci 2009 , silk & norman 2009 ) .",
    "in such a model , sf is triggered coherently and rapidly by a smbh jet - induced hot plasma cocoon , which sweeps up and over pressures cold clouds ( silk 2005 ) .",
    "the instabilities caused by a broad jet propagating into an inhomogeneous ism leads cold clouds to shock and disperse into filaments ( krause & alexander 2007 ; antonuccio - delogu & silk 2008 ) . over time , more and more gas condenses into the cold phase and fragment into small stable cloudlets , which may host sf ( mellema et al . 2002 ; fragile et al .",
    "the overall feedback to sf is positive , and the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding protogalactic gas at first stimulates sf on a time - scale which is much shorter than the one required by negative feedback from sne to take place .",
    "such a scenario is supported by evidence for jet - stimulated sf in high - z systems ( bicknell et al .",

    "because of the short duration of the agn phase , the jet - induced sf - enhancement may be more common than the detections of systems presenting simulaneously a starburst and an agn .",

    "one major difficulty is to explain the undisturbed morphologies as visible in a large fraction of the systems observed at @xmath1 ( wang et al .",
    "2013 ) : the last major merger triggering the starburst must date back enough to allow the systems to relax and present an undisturbed velocity profile .",
    "another major difficulty of explaining the properties of the most massive qso hosts at @xmath118 by means of mergers , in particular within lcdm galaxy formation , is that lcdm - based models generally tend to underpredict the rate of merging , hence the abundance , of massive galaxies at high redshift ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , within the same scenario , various results have shown that a strictly negative feedback of the agn is not enough to accelerate the gas consumption timescales enough to account for the basic scaling relations of elliptical galaxies outlining their marked anti - hierarchical mass buildup , such as the [ @xmath124/fe]-mass relation ( pipino et al .",
    "2009b ; calura & menci 2011 ; yates et al .",

    "acceptable results are instead achieved assuming @xmath143 gyr , i.e. an order of magnitude smaller than the one assumed in chemical evolution models designed to reproduce the properties of local galaxies .",
    "this assumption is supported by other theoretical attempts to model the dust content of galaxies .",
    "sophisticated models including a treatment of the grain size distribution and physical processes such as shattering ( kuo & hirashita 2012 ) and coagulation ( asano et al . 2013 ) indicate that the grain size has an important effect on the grain growth . in particular , at extreme star forming conditions such as in high - z starbursts , turbulence - driven collisions between grains moving at high velocities could render grain shattering very efficient , with the production of large numbers of small grains .",
    "the grain growth rate is an increasing function of the surface - to - volume ratio of the dust grains : an efficient shattering increases this ratio , enhancing the accretion process ( kuo & hirashita 2012 ) . according to these results , a shorter accretion timescale in starbursts",

    "in fact , as mentioned in kuo & hirashita ( 2012 ) , also larger average particle densities in high - z molecular clouds are likely to decrease the accretion timescales , as well as the supersolar metallicities which may characterise some qso hosts ( dodorico et al .",

    "however , the dust yields per unit stellar mass required by the large dust content of @xmath1 qsos are probably too high even for a top - heavy imf ( michalowski et al .",

    "another fundamental parameter in chemical evolution models is the stellar initial mass function , which could be different from the local one in environments characterized by peculiar physical conditions , such as high-@xmath0 starbursts .",
    "larson ( 1998 ) presented a list of circumstantial evidence supporting the possibility of a high-@xmath0 imf more skewed towards massive stars with respect to the local one .",

    "furthermore , larger average molecular cloud masses can also be explained by a less efficient cooling at lower metallicities and by means of a particularly intense uv radiation field .",
    "also the g - dwarf problem , i.e. the overabundance of low - metallicity stars predicted by closed - box chemical evolution models using a standard imf , may be partially alleviated with the assumption of an imf poor in low mass stars , even though other realistic solutions could be proposed , such as an infall of pristine gas .",
    "other indirect evidence involve the observed evolution of the optical luminosity density , which may be underestimated using a normal imf if dust extinction is taken into account .",

    "this is also supported by our results ; the production of large amounts of dust has necessarily to be accompanied by large stellar masses . on the other hand",

    "2009 ) and euclid ( laureijs 2011 ) . to compute the seds in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed ] , for our model galaxy we have assumed a formation redshift of @xmath161 .",
    "these assumptions imply that the systems observed at @xmath1 should be @xmath162 gyr old ; according to the star formation history of our model me311s , at 0.5 gyr star formation is about to cease .",
    "[ fig_sed ] shows that , in principle , the massive descendants of the qso hosts could be detected by both lsst and euclid out to al least @xmath163 .",
    "they could even be detected at larger redshifts ( @xmath164 ) thanks to the deep portions of these surveys .    in order to assess how many of such systems will be observable by future surveys",
    ", we can evaluate the expected integral number @xmath165 of descendants of qso hosts brighter than @xmath166 .    in a given redshift interval between @xmath167 and @xmath168 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath165 can be calculated from the integral @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the luminosity function ( lf ) and @xmath171 is the comoving volume element ( pozzetti et al .",
    "1996 ; shimasaku & fukugita 1998 ) . the relation between the absolute magnitude @xmath172 and the apparent magnitude @xmath166 is @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the luminosity distance expressed in pc , @xmath175 is the evolutionary correction and @xmath176 is the k - correction .    to assess the luminosity function of the massive qso descendants , we use the black hole mass function estimated by willott et al .",
    "( 2010b ) for a sample of quasars at @xmath177 .",
    "this function is converted into a lf by assuming a fixed @xmath178 , i.e. corresponding to the local value ( marconi & hunt 2003 ) , by computing the @xmath179 ratio directly from our seds , and assuming that the latter quantity is does not vary with the bulge stellar mass @xmath180 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_counts ] we show the expected integrated counts in various redshift bins and in the three euclid near - infrared bands @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 . the dotted vertical lines in fig .  [ fig_counts ] correspond to the magnitude limit of the deep and wide euclid surveys , i.e. ab magnitudes 26 and 24 , respectively .",
    "the largest contribution to the number counts come from the systems at redshift between 0 and 2 . in the h band",
    ", @xmath184 systems per square degree are expected at @xmath185 ; this means that in the area of the euclid deep survey of 40 square degrees , @xmath186 objects are expected .",
    "the euclid wide survey has a considerably larger area , of the order of 15000 @xmath187 ( laureijs 2011 ; majerotto et al .",
    "2012 ) ; in such an area , @xmath188 qso host descendants are expected between @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "more problematic is the detection of such objects at larger redshifts : in the j and h bands , @xmath191 and @xmath192 objects between @xmath193 and @xmath51 are expected in the deep portion of the euclid survey , respectively .",
    "figures  [ fig_sed ] and  [ fig_counts ] show that the sensitivity of future wide - field surveys is sufficient to provide a complete characterization of the optical to near - ir sed of the descendants of @xmath118 qso hosts .",
    "therefore , although their surface density on the sky will be overwhelmed by that of other galaxies and local stars , accurate sed - fitting procedures would provide reliable photo - z measurements to identify these descendants",
    ".    it may be interesting to compare our predictions to actual depths and areas reached in existing surveys , i.e. cosmos and candels .",
    "overall , given their small areas , we do not expect to detect a significant number of descendants of @xmath1 qsos . in the cosmos",
    "ultravista survey ( mccracken et al . 2012 , with an area of @xmath1531.5 @xmath187 ) , at h - band magnitude 25 we expect to detect @xmath153100 qso descendants in total , with only 1 - 2 of them at very high - z ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "similar numbers are expected in the deep pencil - beam candels survey ( 0.2 @xmath187 , grogin et al . 2011 ) in the h band at magnitude 27 .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that if we had assumed a larson ( 1998 ) imf to compute the spectra , the detectability of the high redshift descendants would be more problematic ; in fact , such an imf causes lower stellar masses and consequently fainter objects . + also the assumption of a larger @xmath151 ratio as suggested by some authors ( wang et al .",
    "2013 ) would worsen their detectability , since it would imply a shift of the mass function towards fainter magnitudes , i.e. a lower number density at fixed stellar mass .",
    "the dust content of high-@xmath0 qsos is a record of their star formation history . in this paper",
    "we have shown how , by studying the dust content of such systems in combination with other observables , such as the neutral gas mass , the molecular gas and the sfr , it is possible to achieve crucial information on their star formation efficiency and derive constraints for other fundamental parameters , such as the dust accretion timescale and their initial stellar mass function .",
    "+ in this paper , we have collected a database of 58 high redshift ( @xmath195 ) qsos from various sources in the literature and discovered by various surveys , including the sdss , the cfhqs , the ndfws and the ukidss survey and observed in the fir . for each systems , by means of standard calibration methods , we derived the dust masses , the sfrs , and , when possible , the neutral gas masses and the h2 masses . in a few cases ,",
    "estimates of the dynamical masses are available .",
    "+ we have interpreted the observed dust masses , gas masses and dynamical masses by means of chemical evolution models designed to reproduce the main features of local elliptical galaxies .",
    "these models are tuned to account for the local abundance ratios ( e.g. , pipino et al .",
    "2009a ) and the dust content of local early - type galaxies ( calura et al . 2008 ) , and they have already been used to study the dust budget in one qso host galaxy at @xmath196 ( pipino et al .",
    "we have considered chemical evolution models for galaxies of three different baryonic masses , encompassing the range of dynamical masses derived for high-@xmath0 qso hosts .",
    "some fundamental parameters regulating star formation and dust production , including the initial stellar mass function , have been studied in detail when comparing model results with observed data .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows : +    * most of the observed systems present upper limits for the dust masses . for such systems , in general",
    "the dust masses , gas masses and sfrs are consistent with the results of our chemical evolution models adopting standard prescriptions for star formation , dust production and a standard , salpeter imf .",
    "the systems presenting detections for dust masses , sfrs , gas masses and dynamical masses represent the most luminous sources ; our standard models fail to reproduce both the dust masses and the sfrs for these peculiar systems . * to reproduce the high star formation rates at the observed gas masses of such peculiar systems , the star formation efficiency adopted in our standard models needs to be increased .",
    "this can be explained qualitatively by means of a `` positive '' agn feedback , boosting star formation in the innermost regions of proto - spheroidals ( silk 2005 ) .",
    "the enhanced sf efficiencies found in chemical evolution studies including this process support this conclusion ( pipino et al . 2009a ) . by increasing the star formation efficiency",
    ", the dust content is reduced owing to more efficient grain destruction by supernovae . *",
    "the dust content of the systems with detections require an average dust yield per stellar mass larger than solar .",
    "this can be achieved by increasing the dust growth efficiency and by assuming a top - heavy imf . * by assuming a dust growth efficiency an order of magnitude larger than the one implied by studies of the local dust budget , the discrepancy between our models and the observed dataset is reduced .",
    "theoretical studies of dust production in starbursts indicate that , in extreme star formation conditions , larger growth efficiencies can be explained by larger average particle densities in high - z molecular clouds , as well as higher metallicities . * beside an enhanced star formation and dust growth efficiency , to fully account for the observed dust masses , a top - heavy stellar initial mass function is required . in this work ,",
    "we have considered a larson ( 1998 ) imf with a a characteristic mass of @xmath197 m@xmath109 . a top - heavy imf in high-@xmath0 starbursts can be explained by means of an average jeans mass larger to the local one , due mostly to less efficient cooling and to a particularly intense uv radiation field .",
    "a top - heavy imf would imply a ten - times solar interstellar metallicity .",
    "no such vale has ever been observed so far , in any environment . in the future ,",
    "the use of alma for the study of diagnostics such as the far - infrared fine - structure emission lines [ nii ] at 205 @xmath8 and [ cii ] at 158 @xmath8 , already used for the analysis of the metal content of a massive starburst at z@xmath153 4.8 ( nagao et al .",
    "2012 ) , will be of crucial importance to constrain the metallicity and hence the stellar imf of high - redshift star - busts .",
    "* the descendants of some of our systems may be potentially visible at lower redshift , in the form of large , passive objects . by means of a spectro - photometric code",
    "( jimenez et al . 2004 ) , starting from our model star formation history , we computed synthetic spectra for the descendants of the high-@xmath0 qso hosts . in principle , the sensitivity limits of deep future surveys such as lsst and euclid will allow one to reveal such systems already at large redshifts ( @xmath2 ) . by normalizing their number density to the bh mass function of high-@xmath0 qso hosts , we predicted the expected number counts of such objects .",
    "their presence could be significant in the wide euclid survey , where @xmath188 qso host descendants are expected between @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "future studies of the properties of qso hosts will be very important to assess the nature of the progenitors of present - day ellipticals , and will serve as valuable benchmark for galaxy formation theories . as forthcoming work , it will be important to use the data collected in this work to investigate the dust content , the sf properties , and the buildup of both the bulge and black hole mass by means of semi - analytical galaxy formation models .",

    "<S> infrared observations of high-@xmath0 quasar ( qso ) hosts indicate the presence of large masses of dust in the early universe . when combined with other observables , such as neutral gas masses and star formation rates , the dust content of @xmath1 qso hosts may help constraining their star formation history . </S>",
    "<S> we have collected a database of 58 sources from the literature discovered by various surveys and observed in the fir . </S>",
    "<S> we have interpreted the available data by means of chemical evolution models for forming proto - spheroids , investigating the role of the major parameters regulating star formation and dust production . </S>",
    "<S> for a few systems , given the derived small dynamical masses , the observed dust content can be explained only assuming a top - heavy initial mass function , an enhanced star formation efficiency and an increased rate of dust accretion . </S>",
    "<S> however , the possibility that , for some systems , the dynamical mass has been underestimated can not be excluded . if this were the case , the dust mass can be accounted for by standard model assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> we provide predictions regarding the abundance of the descendants of qso hosts ; albeit rare , such systems should be present and detectable by future deep surveys such as euclid already at @xmath2 .    </S>",
