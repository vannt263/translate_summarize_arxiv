    "the potential of emerging technologies such as fuel cells ( fcs ) and photovoltaics for environmentally - benign power generation has sparked renewed interest in the development of novel materials for high - density energy storage .",
    "for mobile applications such as in the transportation sector , the demands placed upon energy storage media are especially stringent,@xcite as the leading candidates to replace fossil - fuel - powered internal combustion engines ( ices)proton exchange membrane fcs and hydrogen - powered ices ( h@xmath1-ices)rely on h@xmath1  as a fuel .",
    "although h@xmath1  has about three times the energy density of gasoline by weight , its volumetric density , even when pressurized to 10,000  psi , is roughly six times less than that of gasoline .",
    "consequently , safe and efficient storage of h@xmath1  has been identified@xcite as one of the key scientific obstacles to realizing a transition to h@xmath1-powered vehicles .",
    "perhaps the most promising approach to achieving the high h@xmath1densities needed for mobile applications is via absorption in solids.@xcite metal hydrides such as lani@xmath2h@xmath3 have long been known to reversibly store hydrogen at volumetric densities surpassing that of liquid h@xmath1 , but their considerable weight results in gravimetric densities that are too low for lightweight applications.@xcite accordingly , recent efforts@xcite have increasingly focused on low - z complex hydrides , such as metal borohydrides , @xmath4(bh@xmath5)@xmath6 , where @xmath4 represents a metallic cation , as borohydrides have the potential to store large quantities of hydrogen ( up to 18.5 wt.% in libh@xmath0 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the thermodynamics of h@xmath1-desorption from known borohydrides are generally not compatible with the temperature - pressure conditions of fc operation : for example , in libh@xmath0  strong hydrogen - host bonds result in desorption temperatures in excess of 300@xmath7c.@xcite thus the suitability of libh@xmath0  and other stable hydrides as practical h@xmath1-storage media will depend upon the development of effective destabilization schemes .",
    "building on earlier work by reilly and wiswall,@xcite vajo _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite recently demonstrated that libh@xmath0  can be destabilized by mixing with mgh@xmath1 . in isolation , the decomposition of these compounds proceeds according to :    [ pure_rxns ] @xmath8    yielding 13.6 and 7.6 wt.% h@xmath1 , respectively , at temperatures above 300@xmath7c .",
    "the high desorption temperatures are consistent with the the relatively high enthalpies of desorption : @xmath9 67 ( libh@xmath0 ) and @xmath1070 ( mgh@xmath1 ) kj/(mol h@xmath1).@xcite by mixing libh@xmath0  with mgh@xmath1 , @xmath11 for the combined reaction can be decreased below those of the isolated compounds due to the exothermic formation enthalpy of mgb@xmath12 : @xmath13 that is , formation of the mgb@xmath12 product _ stabilizes _ the dehydrogenated state in eq .",
    "[ destab ] relative to that of eq .",
    "[ pure_rxns ] , thereby _ destabilizing _ both libh@xmath0  and mgh@xmath1 . by adopting this strategy , measured isotherms for the libh@xmath0  + @xmath14mgh@xmath1  mixture over 315400@xmath7c exhibited a 25 kj / mol h@xmath1  decrease in @xmath11 relative libh@xmath0  alone , with an approximately tenfold increase in equilibrium h@xmath1pressure.@xcite in addition , the hydride mixture was shown to be reversible with a density of 810 wt.% h@xmath1.@xcite nevertheless , the extrapolated temperature of @xmath15c at which @xmath16  bar is still too high for mobile applications , and suggests that _ additional _ destabilization is necessary .",
    "the concept of thermodynamic destabilization appears to offer new opportunities for accessing the high h@xmath1  content of strongly - bound hydrides .",
    "however , the large number of known hydrides suggests that experimentally testing all possible combinations of known compounds would be impractical ; thus a means for rapidly screening for high - density h@xmath1-storage reactions with appropriate thermodynamics@xcite would be of great value . towards these ends , here we employ first - principles calculations to identify new h@xmath1-storage reactions with favorable temperature - pressure characteristics based on destabilizing libh@xmath0  and ca(bh@xmath0)@xmath1@xcite by mixing with selected metal hydrides .",
    "our goal is to determine whether additional destabilization of libh@xmath0  and ca(bh@xmath0)@xmath1beyond that demonstrated@xcite with libh@xmath0/mgh@xmath1is possible by exploiting the exothermic formation enthalpies of the metal borides .",
    "we focus specifically on thermodynamic issues since appropriate thermodynamics is a necessary condition for any viable storage material , and thermodynamic properties are not easily altered .",
    "while kinetics must also be considered , catalysts and novel synthesis routes have been shown to be effective at improving reversibility and the rates of h@xmath1  uptake / release.@xcite by screening through @xmath1020 distinct reactions , we identify four new destabilized mixtures having favorable gibbs free energies of desorption in conjunction with high gravimetric ( 59 wt.% ) and volumetric ( 85100 g h@xmath1/l ) storage densities .",
    "the predicted reactions present new avenues for experimental investigation , and illustrate that compounds with low gravimetric densities ( i.e. , transition metal hydrides ) may yield viable h@xmath1-storage solutions when mixed with lightweight borohydrides .",
    "an advantage of the present approach is that it relies only on known compounds with established synthesis routes , in contrast to other recent studies which have proposed h@xmath1-storage reactions based on materials which have yet to be synthesized.@xcite    an additional distinguishing feature of this study is the development of a set of thermodynamic guidelines aimed at facilitating more robust predictions of hydrogen storage reactions .",

    ", this exercise reveals some of the common pitfalls that may arise when attempting to simply `` guess '' at reaction mechanisms .",
    "our first - principles calculations were performed using a planewave - projector augmented wave method ( vasp)@xcite based on the generalized gradient approximation@xcite to density functional theory .",

    "thus @xmath11 for the destabilized libh@xmath0  reaction is simply an average of the hydride desorption enthalpies , less the enthalpy of boride formation .",

    "crystal structure,@xcite we expect @xmath29 due to the higher enthalpy of the liquid state .",
    "we begin our discussion of the candidate reactions by commenting on the vibrational contributions ( @xmath30 ) of the solid state phases to the total dehydrogenation entropy , @xmath31 .",
    "based on the notion that @xmath31 is largely due to the entropy of h@xmath1   [ @xmath32j/(mol k ) at 300 k ] , a dehydrogenation enthalpy in the approximate range of 2050 kj / mol h@xmath1  would yield desorption pressures / temperatures that are consistent with the operating conditions of a fc.@xcite however , as shown in the last column of table  [ table ] , the calculated @xmath30 are not negligible ( up to 21% ) in comparison to @xmath33 , calling into question the assumption @xmath34 and the guideline @xmath11 = 2050  kj / mol h@xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that a precise determination of the pressure - temperature characteristics of a given desorption reaction requires evaluating the change in gibbs free energy [ @xmath35 , accounting explicitly for the effects of temperature and @xmath30 , as done below .",
    "a key concern when attempting to predict favorable hydrogen storage reactions is to ensure that the thermodynamically preferred reaction pathway has been identified .",
    "this is a non - trivial task , and our experience has shown that intuition alone is not sufficient to correctly identify realistic reactions involving multicomponent systems.@xcite in this regard , several of the reactions in table  [ table ] ( denoted by @xmath36 ) are noteworthy as they illustrate the difficulties that may arise when `` guessing '' at reactions .",
    "for example , all of the candidate reactions are written as simple , single - step reactions .",
    "while this may seem reasonable given the mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "( eq .  [ destab ] ) and its generalization in eq .",
    "[ gen_eqn ] , as we discuss below , some of these reactions should proceed via multiple step pathways , with each step having thermodynamic properties that are distinct from the presumed single - step pathway .",
    "we group the examples of how chemical intuition might fail into three categories , and for each class , give a general guideline describing the thermodynamic restriction :    _ ( 1 ) reactant mixtures involving `` weakly - bound '' compounds : _ we refer here to systems where the enthalpy to decompose one ( or more ) of the reactant phases is less than the enthalpy of the proposed destabilized reaction ; thus , the weakly - bound phase(s ) will decompose before ( i.e. , at a temperature below that which ) the destabilized reaction can proceed .",
    "two examples of this behavior can be found in table  [ table ] .",
    "the first case pertains to reactions 1316 , which , based on their larger enthalpies relative to reaction 12 , would appear to `` stabilize '' ca(bh@xmath0)@xmath1 . in reality",
    ", ca(bh@xmath0)@xmath1  will decompose before ( with @xmath16  bar at @xmath37 = 88@xmath7c ) any of the higher temperature reactions 1316 will occur ( @xmath38 110@xmath7c ) , indicating that it is impossible to stabilize a reaction in this manner .",
    "additional examples of this scenario occur in reactions 1 , 8 , 17 , and 21 , which involve the metastable alh@xmath39  and crh@xmath1  phases . in the case of reaction 1 , alh@xmath39will decompose first ( yielding al and @xmath40h@xmath1 ) , followed by reaction of al with libh@xmath0  ( reaction 2 ) .",
    "the consequences of this behavior are significant , since although the intended reaction 1 has an enthalpy ( @xmath1040 kj / mol h@xmath1 ) in the targeted range , in reality the reaction will consist of two steps , the first of which has an enthalpy below the targeted range ( alh@xmath41 decomposition ) , while the second ( reaction 2 ) has an enthalpy above this range .",
    "_ guideline 1 : the enthalpy of the proposed destabilized reaction must be less than the decomposition enthalpies of the individual reactant phases . _    _ ( 2 ) unstable combinations of product or reactant phases : _ reaction 4 illustrates how the seemingly straightforward process of identifying stable reactant and product phases can become unexpectedly complex . here , the starting mixture of libh@xmath0  and mg is unstable and will undergo the exothermic transformation : @xmath42 which will consume the available mg and form mgh@xmath1 , which will itself react endothermically with the remaining libh@xmath0  according to reaction 24 . the exothermic nature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : exolibh ] ) can be understood by noting that the enthalpy of reaction 4 ( 46.4 kj / mol h@xmath1 ) is lower than the decomposition enthalpy of mgh@xmath12 , given by reaction 27 ( 62.3 kj / mol h@xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , the total energy can be lowered by transferring hydrogen to the more strongly bound mgh@xmath1  compound .",
    "_ guideline 2 : if the proposed reaction involves a reactant that can absorb hydrogen ( such as an elemental metal ) , the formation enthalpy of the corresponding hydride can not be greater in magnitude than the enthalpy of the destabilized reaction . _    _ ( 3 ) lower - energy reaction pathways : _ reaction 3 , involving a 4:1 mixture of libh@xmath0:mgh@xmath1 , as well as the related reaction involving a 7:1 stoichiometry , 7libh@xmath0  + mgh@xmath1  @xmath43 mgb@xmath44 + 7lih + 11.5h@xmath1 , were recently suggested in ref .  , which considered only a single - step mechanism resulting in the formation of mgb@xmath0  and mgb@xmath44 , respectively .",
    "here we demonstrate that these reactions will not proceed as suggested there due to the presence of intermediate stages with lower energies .",
    "in fact , both hypothetical reactions have larger enthalpies [ @xmath45 = 69 ( 4:1 ) and 74 ( 7:1 ) kj / mol h@xmath1@xcite ] than the 2:1 mixture ( reaction 24 ) , suggesting that , upon increasing temperature , the 4:1 and 7:1 mixtures will follow a pathway whose initial reaction step is the 2:1 reaction ( reaction 24 ) , which will consume all available mgh@xmath1 .",
    "subsequent reactions between unreacted libh@xmath0  and newly - formed mgb@xmath1  will become thermodynamically feasible at temperatures above that of reaction 24 , since their enthalpies exceed 50 kj / mol h@xmath1 .",
    "[ similar behavior is expected for reactions 9 & 10 , as the 1:1 mixture of libh@xmath0:fe ( reaction 9 ) will initially react in a 1:2 ratio ( reaction 10 ) , which has a lower enthalpy . ] _ guideline 3 : in general , it is not possible to tune the thermodynamics of destabilized reactions by adjusting the molar fractions of the reactants .",
    "there is only one stoichiometry corresponding to a single - step reaction with the lowest possible enthalpy ; all other stoichiometries will release h@xmath1  in multi - step reactions , where the initial reaction is given by the lowest - enthalpy reaction_.    .",
    "the region within the dashed box corresponds to desirable temperatures and pressures for on - board hydrogen storage : @xmath46 = 1700  bar , @xmath37 = -40100@xmath7c . ]      in total , the preceding examples reveal that great care must be taken in predicting hydrogen storage reactions .",
    "having ruled out the specious reactions , we now discuss the thermodynamics of the remaining reactions . using the calculated thermodynamic data ( table  [ table ] ) as input to the vant hoff equation , @xmath47 , where @xmath48  bar , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] plots the equilibrium h@xmath1  desorption pressures of these reactions as a function of temperature",
    ".  structural transition at @xmath49c@xcite , which should reduce the slope of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath50 . ] included in the plot is a rectangle delineating desirable temperature and pressure ranges for h@xmath1  storage : -40100@xmath7c , and 1700  bar .",
    "as expected , our vant hoff plot confirms that the experimental reactions having large dehydrogenation enthalpies ( reactions 2427 ) yield pressures @xmath51  bar , even at elevated temperatures . on the other hand , some of the candidate reactions , for example 5 and 19 ,",
    "readily evolve h@xmath1  at very low temperatures ( consistent with their low enthalpies ) and are therefore too weakly bound for practical , reversible on - board storage .",
    "however , the candidate reactions involving mixtures with sch@xmath1 ( reactions 7 and 18 ) and cr ( reactions 11 and 22 ) desorb h@xmath1  in @xmath52-@xmath37 regimes that strongly intersect the window of desirable operating conditions .",
    "these reactions have room - temperature enthalpies in the range of 2733 kj / mol h@xmath1 , relatively high h@xmath1   densities ( 58.9 wt.% h@xmath1  and 85 - 100 g h@xmath1/l ) , and achieve @xmath16  bar at moderate temperatures ranging from 26 and @xmath5338@xmath7c .",
    "thus , via a first - principles approach of rapid screening through a large number of candidate reactions , and the careful use of thermodynamic considerations to eliminate unstable or multi - step reactions , we predict here several reactions with attributes that surpass the state - of - the - art for reversible , low - temperature storage materials .",
    "in conclusion , using first - principles free energy calculations we have demonstrated that further significant destabilization of the strongly - bound libh@xmath0  and ca(bh@xmath0)@xmath1  borohydrides is possible , and we identify several high h@xmath1-density reactions having thermodynamics compatible with the operating conditions of mobile h@xmath1-storage applications .",
    "unlike other recent predictions , the proposed reactions utilize only known compounds with established synthesis routes , and can therefore be subjected to immediate experimental testing . in addition , we provide guidance to subsequent efforts aimed at predicting new h@xmath1  storage materials by illustrating common pitfalls that arise when attempting to `` guess '' at reaction mechanisms , and by suggesting a set of thermodynamic guidelines to facilitate more robust predictions ."
