    "recently , superconductivity was found in pucoga@xmath0 at the amazingly high transition temperature ( t@xmath5 ) of 18.5 k @xcite .",
    "considering the fact that the highest t@xmath5 of f - electron based compounds @xcite was @xmath6 2k , the t@xmath5 of 18.5 k is an order of magnitude larger value than the previous highest t@xmath5 in f - electron based superconducting compounds .",
    "therefore , the understanding the origin of this 18.5 k transition temperature in pucoga@xmath0 should not only provide important information on the puzzling behavior of f - electrons but also shed light on the origin of the high transition temperature in cuprate superconductors .",
    "let us briefly review the experimental data known about pucoga@xmath0 .",
    "first , from the specific heat jump at t@xmath5 , the sommerfeld coefficient is @xmath7 mj / k@xmath8mol .",
    "second , from the t@xmath9 phonon contribution in c(t ) , the typical value of the phonon frequency scale ( @xmath10 ) is estimated to be 240 k. third , the resistivity @xmath1 shows a typical s - shape behavior in its temperature dependence , which is often observed in spin fluctuating heavy fermion compounds such as upt@xmath9 [ @xcite ] .",
    "another important piece of information from @xmath1 is its magnitude ; the value @xmath11 cm itself indicates strong scattering of the conduction electrons ( an order of magnitude larger than the values of cemin@xmath0 ( m = co , ir , rh ) superconductors having t@xmath5 of @xmath6 2 k @xcite ) .",
    "forth , puzzling is the data of the uniform susceptibility @xmath12 ; it shows an almost exact curie - weiss temperature dependence of @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "this indicates that there are almost free local moments in the temperature range of 18.5 to 300 k with an effective local moment magnitude ( 0.68 @xmath15 ) close to the value of the local moment of free pu@xmath16 ( 0.84 @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "we believe that these local moments responsible for the observed @xmath12 are not coupled ( or negligibly weakly coupled ) to the conduction electrons and play no significant role in the transport properties as well as in the superconducting pairing .",
    "this does not mean that there are no interesting spin fluctuations  their contribution to @xmath12 might be much smaller than the local moment contribution or more probably their temperature dependence is not pronounced . if this is the case , the curie - like @xmath12 should continue to exist below the transition temperature and should be observable if the diamagnetic part of @xmath12 is subtracted or suppressed below t@xmath5 .    as a possible pairing mechanism and pairing symmetry",
    ", we do not have much decisive data except estimates of a few energy scales .",
    "first of all , conventional phonon mediated pairing seems not unreasonable but only barely possible with values of @xmath17 , dimensionless coupling constant @xmath18 , and a typical value for the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath19 .",
    "the allen - dynes t@xmath5 formula @xcite t@xmath20 $ ] provides t@xmath5=16.7k for @xmath21 and t@xmath5=2.9k for @xmath22 , respectively . on the other hand , although there is not yet direct experimental evidence , the existence of pu f - orbitals participating in fermi level crossing band(s ) @xcite and the isostructure cemin@xmath0 ( m = co , rh , ir ) compounds let us suspect the important role of spin - fluctuations to explain the normal state transport properties as well as the pairing mechanism in pucoga@xmath0 .    in this paper ,",
    "we examine two possible bosonic scattering mechanisms , namely , phonons and spin - fluctuations , to consistently understand the available experimental data mentioned above .",
    "our strategy is the following . assuming each bosonic scattering",
    ", we try to fit the dc - resistivity data @xmath1 for its temperature dependence as well as its magnitude . from this fitting procedure",
    ", we extract the magnitude of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath23 and the typical energy scale of the corresponding boson . from these two numbers ,",
    "we then can estimate t@xmath5 using mcmillan s formula .",
    "we calculate the conductivity using the kubo formula as follows .",
    "@xmath24}]\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the one particle spectral density of quasiparticle in the conduction band and the retarded green function of the quasiparticle is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "all scattering information is included in the self - energy @xmath27 . within the born approximation , the self - energy is calculated as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the spectral density of a bosonic propagator @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the electron - boson coupling constant . after a matsubara frequency ( @xmath32 ) summation , the imaginary part of @xmath33 is written as    @xmath34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the boson and fermion distribution functions , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the density of states per spin at the fermi level . plugging the self - energy eq.(2 ) into eq.(1 ) and summing @xmath38 , eq.(1 ) gives    @xmath39 } ] \\frac{1}{im \\sigma_r ( t , \\omega)}\\ ] ]    a few remarks are in order for the above equations .",
    "first , the vertex correction is ignored .",
    "the justification is that when the scattering is local in space  technically meaning that the self - energy is momentum independent  the current vertex is not renormalized .",
    "this is consistent with the local approximation in calculating eq.(2 ) and eq.(3 ) ; consistent with this , we also neglect the momentum dependence of the coupling @xmath31 implying every quasiparticle is equally scattered by the assumed boson .",
    "second , the self - energy is calculated only in the born approximation .",
    "third , the fermi surface ( fs ) anisotropy is neglected , resulting the factor @xmath40 and the fs averaged fermi velocity squared @xmath41 . with all these approximations",
    ", we should take the temperature power law of the calculated resistivity at low temperatures with reservation .",
    "otherwise it induces an error of order o(1 ) for the overall magnitude . finally , @xmath37 and @xmath41 are the values before they are renormalized by the bosonic scattering and , therefore , are difficult to be estimated from experiments",
    ". we rewrite eq.(4 ) as follows .",
    "@xmath42 } ] \\frac{1}{im \\sigma_r ( t , \\omega)}\\ ] ]    in the above equation , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the quantities renormalized by the bosonic scattering and @xmath45 is the wave function renormalization parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the above expression is very useful for our purpose .",
    "the renormalized quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be obtained from experiments .",
    "furthermore , although eq.(5 ) has an explicit dependence on @xmath45 , the implicit dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath48 makes eq.(5 ) a slowly varying function of @xmath45 .",
    "the reason is because the real and imaginary parts of @xmath49 are related by the kramer - kronig relation , so that @xmath50 resulting @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "we choose the mean field type spin relaxational mode of @xmath52 ^ 2 + [ \\frac{\\omega}{\\gamma}]^2}$ ] , where @xmath53 is the magnetic fermi energy @xcite , @xmath54 is the parameter controlling the distance from a magnetic quantum critical point , and @xmath55 is a typical wave vector of the magnetic ordering .",
    "@xmath56 defines the characteristic energy scale of the fluctuations .",
    "@xmath57 describes the dispersion of the collective mode of @xmath58 .",
    "the magnetic ordering vector @xmath55 can be in two dimensions or in three dimensions depending on the nature of the incipient magnetic order .",
    "this dimensionality of magnetic ordering would affect the power law of the resistivity at low temperatures .",
    "we assume 2-d in our calculations , reflecting the band calculations @xcite .",
    "the overall magnitude @xmath59 of @xmath29 is combined with @xmath60 in eq.(3 ) to determine the overall magnitude of @xmath61 .",
    "this overall magnitude is determined once @xmath62 is fixed .",
    "therefore , we do not need to determine separate values of @xmath63 , @xmath37 , and @xmath59 .",
    "most importantly , @xmath64 determines the low temperature t@xmath65 region of the resistivity before the inflection point ; @xmath66 was extracted from experiments @xcite for t@xmath5 @xmath67 t @xmath67 50k , but a dimensional counting for the spin fluctuations model in 2-d gives @xmath68(t ) @xmath69 at low temperatures .",
    "the temperature variation of @xmath70 in @xmath71 also controls the high temperature saturation behavior of @xmath1 , since increasing value of @xmath71 for larger temperatures reduces the scattering rate .",
    "fig.(1 ) shows the typical results from eq.(5 ) with @xmath45 values varying from 2 to 8 . to be quantitative ,",
    "the experimental values of @xmath72 and @xmath73@xcite are used .",
    "given these two experimental input values , there is no free parameter to adjust the overall magnitude of the resistivity .",
    "the detailed temperature dependence of @xmath68(t ) is controlled by @xmath71 . @xmath74",
    "150 k , @xmath75 are chosen for illustration . as seen in fig.(1 ) , with increasing @xmath45 ,",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath1 to @xmath45 becomes weaker , and for all values of @xmath45 the calculated @xmath76 is smaller than the experimental one by a factor of 3 to 4 ( see fig.2 ) . in order to fit the experimental @xmath77",
    ", we tune the value of @xmath44 , which is a rather rough estimate from the critical magnetic fields ( @xmath78 ) in superconducting state of pucoga@xmath0 , while the value of @xmath79 is more reliable .",
    "we also chose to use @xmath80 which is the ratio of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig.(2 ) in comparison with the experimental @xmath77 .",
    "input parameters are @xmath82 150k , @xmath83=1 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the residual resistivity @xmath86 cm is added to the theoretical result ( the better fitting of the low temperature part only would give @xmath87 .",
    "see the inset of fig.(2 ) . )",
    "the overall fitting is satisfactory from low to high temperatures .",
    "in particular , the saturation behavior at high temperatures is well reproduced with the temperature dependent i(t ) .",
    "this is an expected behavior since increasing temperature should shorten the magnetic correlation length such as @xmath88 .",
    "some discrepancy between the theoretical result and the experimental one beyond 250 k ( fig.2 ) would be due to the failure of the simple relation @xmath89 at such high temperatures . to obtain better fitting in the low temperature region",
    ", one needs to allow a modification of the high temperature part .",
    "the result is shown in the inset .",
    "it indeed reproduces the experimental observation @xmath68(t ) @xmath6 t@xmath90 [ @xcite ] for t@xmath91 t @xmath67 50 k , while the correct theoretical form of @xmath68(t ) at low temperatures is @xmath92 .",
    "fig.3 shows the resistivity calculated with an einstein phonon @xmath93 with @xmath94 , which is the value obtained from the specific heat c(t ) above t@xmath5 @xcite , for varying values of z from 2 to 8 .",
    "the input values are @xmath84 and @xmath95 . as in the spin - fluctuations case ( fig.1 ) , with increasing z values",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath1 to z becomes weaker , and the overall magnitude of @xmath96 is smaller than @xmath97 by the factor of 2 to 3 ( compared the values at t=100k ) . in fig.4 , we show the tuned theoretical results of @xmath96 in comparison with the experimental @xmath77 . as before , in order to increase the overall magnitude of @xmath96 , we tune the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath44 .    in fig.4",
    ", we see that the theoretical resistivity @xmath96 with @xmath98 ( green open squares ) has a higher power law region over a braoder range of low temperatures relative to the experimental data . for overall fitting of the data ,",
    "we add a large impurity resistivity @xmath99 cm , which makes the low temperature part in clear disagreement with experiment .",
    "to fit the low temperature region better , we need to reduce @xmath100 .",
    "the blue open circles are the result with @xmath101 .",
    "this happens to be the same bosonic energy scale as used in the spin - fluctuation model fitting .",
    "it means that the resistivity data reveal a characteristic energy scale of the scattering boson to be @xmath6 150 k , irrespective of the origin of the boson .",
    "an impurity resistivity @xmath102 cm is added .",
    "the inset shows a close - up view of the low temperature region .",
    "there is a clear deviation between @xmath103(t ) @xmath104}$ ] and @xmath105(t ) @xmath6 t@xmath90 [ @xcite ] .",
    "the phonon model has a critical defect at high temperatures with any reasonable parameters . while the experimental @xmath97 show a clear saturation behavior for t @xmath106 160 k , phonon scattering results in an ever increasing t - linear resistivity for temperatures beyond a fraction of @xmath100 .",
    "this saturation behavior in resistivity is a long standing problem in a-15 compounds @xcite , transition metals , and some heavy fermion compounds such as upt@xmath9 [ @xcite ] .",
    "while there is no general mechanism to explain this phenomena @xcite , we can make the following remark .    with the spin - fluctuation model , this saturation behavior",
    "is naturally explained by the temperature dependence of the magnetic correlation length @xmath107 ( see fig.2 ) . on the other hand , phonon scattering needs to invoke a separate mechanism to explain the saturation behavior .",
    "recently , calandra and gunnarsson @xcite , assuming lattice vibrations couple with the electron hopping integral ( hi ) , have shown that the saturation resistivity arises at high temperatures due to a cancellation between an increasing phonon population and an increasing electron kinetic energy . without a specific model and numerical calculations , this saturation behavior can be described phenomenologically in a two parallel resistor model ( `` shunting model '' ) as @xcite    @xmath108    where @xmath109 = @xmath110 , and @xmath111 is calculated by eq.(5 ) .",
    "@xmath112 is the maximum resistivity determined by the @xmath113-sum rule @xcite , but here determined by empirical fitting .    in fig.5",
    ", we show the best fit results with this model . for the electron - phonon resistivity @xmath114 ,",
    "we use z=2 and @xmath115 as in fig.4 and the overall magnitude is tuned with @xmath116 . as seen",
    ", the simple shunting model can not fit the whole temperature region with any parameters in contrast to the successful cases of a-15 compounds @xcite .",
    "the implication is either that the shunting model is not good enough to fit the fine details or that phonon scattering is simply not the correct model for the resistivity of pucoga@xmath0 .      before we estimate t@xmath5 , we need to consider the effect of impurities in the sample .",
    "the effect of impurities on @xmath117 depends on the gap symmetry . for an s - wave gap  in the case of phonon pairing ",
    "t@xmath5 is not reduced by nonmagnetic impurities @xcite in the first approximation . however , for an unconventional non s - wave gap  in the case of spin fluctuation pairing ",
    "t@xmath5 is reduced by any type of impurities . as noticed in the previous section",
    ", the experimental resistivity has a large residual value of @xmath118 , which should be a serious pair breaker for non s - wave pairing .",
    "assuming @xmath119 in the spin fluctuation model and plugging z=4.6 and @xmath120 in eq.(5 ) , we obtain @xmath121 .",
    "this scattering rate is far larger than t@xmath5=18.5 k. from the theory of abrikosov - gorkov @xcite , the transition temperature is reduced by @xmath122 .",
    "but the original abrikosov - gorkov formula should be modified by the mass renormalization factor z as @xmath123 . with z=4.6 and @xmath124 t@xmath5 = t@xmath125 t@xmath126 k",
    ", we estimate the transition temperature of an ideally pure sample to be t@xmath127 39 k. therefore , it appears that if the gap symmetry of pucoga@xmath0 is unconventional , as in most of heavy fermion superconductors , pucoga@xmath0 is another true high temperature superconductor .",
    "the important question is then whether the parameters of the spin fluctuation model obtained in the previous section can produce a transition temperature of @xmath128 k. for a ballpark estimate , we use the allen - dynes formula@xcite for t@xmath5 ,    @xmath129,\\ ] ]    assuming @xmath130 for non s - wave pairing channel .",
    "the important parameter is @xmath131/[\\int_0 ^{\\infty } d \\omega~ \\alpha^2 b(\\omega)/ \\omega]$ ] , which defines the characteristic energy scale of the pairing boson .",
    "the nominal characteristic energy scale of spin fluctuations is @xmath132 k , but the above allen - dynes definition of @xmath133 would give several times @xmath134 because of the @xmath135 long tail of the spin fluctuation spectra @xmath136 .",
    "in reality , the effective cut off energy scale should be between these values , say , @xmath137 @xcite . without solving the strong coupling t@xmath5 equation with details of the band structure and full dynamics of the spin fluctuations , we can not tell the precise value of this . with this reservation for @xmath133 , the allen - dynes formula with @xmath138 and @xmath139 k indeed produces t@xmath140 k.    for",
    "the phonon case , nonmagnetic potential scatterers do not affect t@xmath5 for an s - wave symmetry gap@xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not need to consider impurity effects on t@xmath5 .",
    "the allen - dynes formula with @xmath141 , and @xmath142 gives t@xmath5= 10.44 and 16.7 k for @xmath133=150 k and 240 k , respectively .",
    "however , if we assume that the total mass renormalization ( z=4.6 ) is caused solely by phonon scattering , the effective coupling @xmath143 should be used , and it would be strong enough to produce t@xmath144 k with @xmath133=150 k.      pucoga@xmath0 should have radiation - induced self damage as a function of time .",
    "a preliminary measurement @xcite indicates a decrease of t@xmath5 at a rate of @xmath6 0.2 k / month , due to a radiation damage , which appears to be a quite slow suppression rate at a first look .",
    "here , we estimate a theoretical t@xmath5 suppression with radiation damage and compare it with experiments . because there is no study of radiation damage in pucoga@xmath0 itself , we use results from pu metal ( @xmath145-phase)@xcite .",
    "each pu decays into u and an @xmath146 particle .",
    "both particles collide with nearby pu nuclei creating so - called frenkel pairs consisting of a vacancy and a self - interstitial of pu ions . in the case of @xmath145-pu ,",
    "the total number of frenkel displacements from one pu is 0.1033 per year .",
    "given these data , the estimated number of displacements per pu per month is @xmath6 0.86 @xmath147 . assuming the unitary limit of the impurity scattering strength , the impurity scattering rate is given by @xmath148 , and therefore @xmath149 k. for s - wave pairing , this little potential scattering should have no effect on t@xmath5 suppression .",
    "however , it is not certain whether the displaced pu ions would behave as potential scatterers or magnetic scatterers . for non s - wave unconventional pairing ,",
    "t@xmath5 decreases even with potential scatterers . with a modified abrikosov - gorkov formula , @xmath124 t@xmath5 = t@xmath125 t@xmath5= @xmath123",
    ", we obtain @xmath124 t@xmath150 k per month , assuming the mass renormalization factor @xmath151 , consistent with the experiment .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the t@xmath5 degradation with natural radiation damage is consistent both with unconventional pairing and also with s - wave pairing , if the displaced pu ions behave as magnetic impurities in the latter case .",
    "we have found rather specific constraints on possible pairing bosons to be consistent with available experimental data for pucoga@xmath0 .",
    "we examined two possible bosons as a common source for the normal state resistivity and the superconducting pairing .    for a spin fluctuation model",
    ", we found that the characteristic spin fluctuation energy of 150 k is consistent with the resistivity data .",
    "theoretical calculations of resistivity produce a satisfactory agreement with the experimental resistivity : both for the anomalous power law ( @xmath6 t@xmath90 ) at low temperatures and for the saturation behavior at high temperatures .",
    "the same spin fluctuations would produce unconventional superconducting pairing , such as d - wave symmetry . in this case",
    ", the large residual resistivity @xmath152 acts as a serious pair breaker . to survive with t@xmath5=18.5 k after this pair breaking effect",
    ", the original t@xmath153 should be @xmath154 k. the allen - dynes t@xmath5 formula can support this high t@xmath153 with @xmath155 .",
    "if this is the case , we have observed another unconventional high temperature superconductor after the cuprate superconductors .",
    "perhaps this large impurity effect explains why ucoga@xmath0 ( @xmath156 cm ) is not a superconductor @xcite .",
    "taken together , we think that spin fluctuations are the most likely source of superconducting pairing as well as the normal state resistivity in pucoga@xmath0 .    for the phonon model , we found that the most consistent phonon frequency to fit the resistivity data should be also 150 k , having a discrepancy with the estimate from the specific heat measurement ( @xmath157 k ) .",
    "however , theoretical calculations of the resistivity with phonon scattering have crucial defects to explain the experimental resistivity .",
    "first , it is impossible to produce @xmath105(t ) @xmath6 t@xmath90 with phonon scattering at low temperatures .",
    "second , the saturation behavior at high temperatures needs a separate explanation  this high temperature feature in resistivity has no direct relation with the superconducting pairing mechanism , though .",
    "putting aside these defects and pushing the possibility of the phonon pairing , the merit of phonon mediated s - wave pairing is its insensitivity to large impurity scattering observed in the sample . using a typical strong coupling constant value @xmath21 , it is difficult to achieve t@xmath5 of 20 k. but , assuming that phonon scattering is the main source of the large mass renormalization of z @xmath158 , the allen - dynes t@xmath5 formula with @xmath159 k can easily support t@xmath5 of @xmath6 20 k. in this case we find some similarity with the phonon mediated a-15 compound superconductors , such as nb@xmath160sn .",
    "however , comparing with the spin fluctuation model , we think that the phonon model is unlikely in pucoga@xmath0 .",
    "some key questions to be answered for the phonon model are : ( 1 ) the experimental @xmath161 for t@xmath5 @xmath67 t @xmath67 50 k [ @xcite ] is not easily reconciled with a phonon scattering mechanism ; ( 2 ) the absence of superconductivity in ucoga@xmath0 also needs an explanation if phonons are the pairing boson .",
