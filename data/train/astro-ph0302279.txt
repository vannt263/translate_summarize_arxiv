    "one of the greatest challenges in modern cosmology is understanding the nature of the dark energy responsible for the observed acceleration of the present universe  @xcite .",
    "a popular framework , known as quintessence , involves scalar field models in which the field slow - rolls down a potential , with its potential energy acting analogously to that of early universe inflation  @xcite models .",
    "however , recently a second possibility , that of an effective scalar field theory described by a lagrangian with a non - canonical kinetic term , has also been proposed .",
    "such a model may lead to early time acceleration , where it is named k - inflation  @xcite , or acceleration in the present universe under the name k - essence  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that tachyon dark energy models  @xcite may be seen as special cases of k - essence .",
    "allowing the dark energy to be dynamical provides an opportunity to study the so - called coincidence problem , which asks why dark energy domination begins just at the epoch when we cosmologists exist to observe it .",
    "traditional quintessence models appear promising in this regard , as they can support scaling or tracking solutions , in which the scalar field energy density follows that of the dominant source of matter  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these models require a fine - tuning of parameters , making them not particularly more attractive than a pure cosmological constant in the cases considered so far .",
    "alternatively , a class of k - essence models  @xcite has been claimed to solve the coincidence problem in a generic way ; after a long period of perfect tracking , the domination of dark energy is triggered by the transition to matter domination , a time period during which structures  and cosmologists  can form .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the extent to which these models differ from quintessence models . in particular , one would like to understand whether these models suffer from the same sort of fine tuning issues as quintessence , and also whether observations can differentiate between the two models .",
    "we will address this question by employing field redefinitions which allow k - essence models to be recast in a form similar to quintessence , though we stress immediately that in general the two ideas are distinct and it is not possible to write an arbitrary k - essence model in quintessence form .    throughout this article a prime",
    "denotes a derivative with respect to the argument of the function to which it is applied , and a dot denotes a derivative with respect to time .",
    "to begin with , we wish to be absolutely clear in our terminology .",
    "although the literature contains different usages , particularly of the word quintessence , it is important that our own usage be unambiguous .",
    "we will use the word ` quintessence ' exclusively to refer to models which feature a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term ( whereas in some other papers the definition of quintessence is so general as to include k - essence within it ) .",
    "we now introduce the k - essence model . neglecting for now the part of the lagrangian containing ordinary matter , the action for a k - essence field @xmath0 is given by @xmath1}{\\,\\mathrm{,}}\\ ] ] where we assume @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the name of the model suggests that the field should be driven only by its kinetic energy . for that to be strictly true one should impose @xmath4 ,",
    "otherwise that term could be separated as a potential term independent of @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , for sufficiently small @xmath6 , one could even write @xmath7 and , after field redefinition , obtain a canonical scalar field with a potential . however this condition is not imposed in most k - essence papers , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite , and we will not impose it either .    in order to be even more general , one may include a separate potential term @xmath8 in the lagrangian , now setting @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "obviously , this model includes the one given by eq .",
    "( [ k_action ] ) .",
    "we give an extension of our results to this more general possibility in the appendix .",
    "now , we recall some properties summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the perfect fluid analogy ,",
    "the pressure and the energy density are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 the equation of state parameter is given by @xmath11 while the effective sound speed is given by @xmath12 this definition comes from the equation describing the evolution of linear perturbations in a k - essence dominated universe  @xcite , and therefore is relevant when studying the stability of the theory .",
    "we note , however , that , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath13 is not a sufficient condition for the theory to be stable .",
    "it is important to notice that the effective sound speed is not always equal to @xmath14 , as it is in quintessence models .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of perturbations in this case is genuinely different from that in the case of canonical scalar fields and this difference may be observable  @xcite . also , note that the definition given in eq .",
    "( [ sound_speed ] ) is different from the thermodynamic definition of the isentropic sound speed @xmath15 as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the difference arises from the fact that `` a well - defined concept of sound speed does not exist for classical scalar fields '' and therefore their density perturbations behave quite differently from the usual hydrodynamic case .",
    "although models with negative energy density , super - negative or diverging equation of state and/or imaginary or diverging sound speed have been studied , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to restrict the class of models by imposing one or more of the following independent constraints : @xmath16    from the action eq .",
    "( [ k_action ] ) , in the case of a flat robertson ",
    "walker metric @xmath17 the euler  lagrange equation for the k - essence field is @xmath18 where @xmath19 . we see that if @xmath20 at some @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 diverges , the equation is singular and reduces to a first - order equation which gives a constraint on @xmath0 . some problems may arise at this singularity , but we leave this issue for future investigation . in any case , regions separated by a diverging sound speed are disconnected and may be considered as different models . in each such region the euler  lagrange equation may be rewritten as @xmath23    finally , note that , for models in which @xmath24 is analytic and equal to @xmath25 at the origin , then if @xmath26 the function @xmath27 must be negative for some @xmath6 . given that @xmath24 is analytic at the origin , we then have @xmath28 which implies @xmath29 with @xmath30 a positive integer and where @xmath31 is the first non - zero co - efficient .",
    "hence @xmath32 for some range of @xmath6 .    in the models described in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath24 is negative for small @xmath6 and therefore , if @xmath4 then @xmath33 must be negative close to the origin .",
    "hence @xmath34 over some range of @xmath6 . as a result ,",
    "for these models , if one imposes @xmath35 and the analyticity of @xmath24 at the origin , then @xmath36 must be non - zero and , as explained above , this implies that one has , in effect , introduced a potential term .",
    "in this section we present a model which is dynamically equivalent to the k - essence model .",
    "consider a new action @xmath37\\bigg\\}{\\,\\mathrm{,}}\\end{split}\\ ] ] in which we have introduced a field @xmath38 , which acts like a lagrange multiplier .",
    "the variational principle with respect to @xmath38 gives @xmath39 and therefore  as long as @xmath40  the action eq .",
    "( [ newaction ] ) is dynamically equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ k_action ] ) .",
    "note , however , that , when quantized , the theories will no longer be equivalent . now perform a field transformation @xmath41 which leads to @xmath42\\bigg\\}{\\,\\mathrm{,}}\\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] . from now on , for simplicity , we assume that @xmath44 has a constant sign , although this is not a particularly strong assumption .",
    "this allows us to define a new field by computing a modified legendre transformation @xmath45 which finally gives @xmath46{\\,\\mathrm{.}}\\end{split}\\ ] ]    this action is very simple , but contains a non - dynamical field @xmath47 coupled non - canonically to a canonical scalar field @xmath48 .",
    "clearly , if we impose @xmath49 , then the condition @xmath50 implies that @xmath47 is positive , and therefore that the kinetic term has the canonical sign . in the opposite case",
    ", the kinetic term has the sign of the phantom model introduced by caldwell  @xcite .    for the flat robertson  walker metric  ( [ frwmetric ] ) , the energy density and pressure of this two - field component of matter are @xmath51 the euler  lagrange equation for @xmath48 is given by @xmath52 and the constraint equation for @xmath47",
    "is given by @xmath53    if @xmath47 is positive and remains almost constant , the field @xmath48 plays the role of a canonical scalar field .",
    "indeed , by renormalizing @xmath48 as @xmath54 we obtain an ( almost ) equivalent quintessence model which should mimic the k - essence field during the time period for which the assumption of approximately constant @xmath47 holds .",
    "if this is the case when k - essence starts dominating , it will not be possible to distinguish it observationally from a quintessence field , unless one takes into account perturbations . as described in refs .",
    "@xcite the k - essence field can undergo several attractor regimes during which its kinetic energy remains constant .",
    "hence , @xmath47 is indeed constant over those periods of time .",
    "thus , during some time periods , the homogeneous part of the k - essence field will behave exactly like a quintessence field .",
    "in this section we study two examples of k - essence models .",
    "we first study the model described in ref .",
    "@xcite and given by @xmath55}{\\,\\mathrm{.}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to check that this is a rather unconventional model ; for some ranges of @xmath6 we can have @xmath56 , @xmath57 or @xmath58 , and @xmath59 and @xmath22 diverging at @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "nevertheless , this model features an interesting behaviour  in the presence of a dominating fluid with equation of state parameter @xmath62 there exists a stable scaling solution for which @xmath6 is constant and @xmath63    using the transformation described in the last section , we find @xmath64 where @xmath65}{\\,\\mathrm{,}}\\\\ w(\\psi ) & = & \\frac{(\\psi{m_\\mathrm{pl}}^4+p_0)^2}{4p_0}{\\,\\mathrm{.}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided that @xmath6 is constant during the scaling regime ( so that @xmath47 is constant ) , the k - essence field behaves like an inverse power - law quintessence field in its well - known tracker regime .",
    "the transformation described in section  [ dyn_equiv ] allows us to find the appropriate power .",
    "we normalize the kinetic term and obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "obviously , as soon as the scaling solution is modified ( for instance at matter  radiation equality ) @xmath47 evolves until the k - essence field enters a new scaling solution with a new quintessence - like behaviour . in fig .",
    "[ tracker ] we show the evolution of @xmath47 for a cosmologically - realistic model , and also the evolution of the equation of state parameter @xmath68 for the k - essence field and for the almost equivalent quintessence model .",
    "the value of @xmath69 has been chosen so that both models yield the same value of the equation of state parameter in the present epoch . clearly ,",
    "as long as @xmath47 does not remain exactly constant , the equivalence is not perfect and therefore the two models may in principle be distinguished from one another .",
    "however in practice we see in fig .",
    "[ tracker ] that the evolution of @xmath68 is almost exactly the same in the two cases out to high redshift .",
    "as a second example , consider the model described in ref .",
    "@xcite given by @xmath70 and @xmath71{\\,\\mathrm{,}}\\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 .",
    "the constants appearing in this expression are very specific , and it may be that there are simpler versions , but so far this is the best example that we know of in the literature that features an interesting property : the transition between an exact tracker regime and the domination of the k - essence field is triggered by matter  radiation equality and therefore , in a sense , the coincidence problem is solved .",
    "again , for some ranges of @xmath6 , contrary to what is assumed in the first part of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can have @xmath56 , @xmath57 or @xmath58 and @xmath59 and @xmath22 diverging at @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "nevertheless , as long as we take @xmath75 , we have @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath13 and , as explained in section  [ k_essence ] , we know that the field can not cross this boundary .    using the transformation described in section  [ dyn_equiv ] we find @xmath76 note that , since @xmath44 changes sign at @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the legendre transformation described in section  [ dyn_equiv ] can not be computed .",
    "nevertheless we still define @xmath47 as @xmath33 , though @xmath79 can no longer be expressed as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "we have performed a numerical simulation in order to reproduce the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is to say a stable scaling solution during radiation domination which then evolves to k - essence domination after matter  radiation equality . as an aside , we find that the basin of attraction of this solution does not seem to be very large . indeed , random initial conditions , even with a subdominant k - essence field , almost never lead to the desired solution , but instead to an early period of k - essence domination , or in some cases the solution even ceases to exist when , after a finite time , it reaches the singularity @xmath21 .",
    "however we will not pursue this further here , but leave it for a future investigation .    in fig .",
    "[ psi ] we show the evolution of @xmath47 for this model . clearly @xmath47 is almost constant during radiation domination , then evolves to another constant soon after matter  radiation equality , remaining nearly constant even during the transition to k - essence domination .",
    "consequently , we know that during these two time periods the k - essence field behaves like a quintessence field .",
    "renormalizing @xmath48 in order to have a canonical kinetic term , we find two exponential potential quintessence models given by @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which mimic the k - essence field during the two time periods described above respectively .    in order to mimic the k - essence field during these two time periods with only one quintessence model one",
    "may add both potentials to obtain a double exponential quintessence model  @xcite .",
    "in this case we have normalized the potential to fit the late - time behaviour of the k - essence field .",
    "the evolution of the energy density for all these models is shown in fig .",
    "[ rho ] and it is evident that the quintessence models closely mimic the k - essence field while @xmath47 is constant .",
    "moreover , as expected , the double exponential model allows us to mimic the k - essence field for early times as well as for the late - time evolution of the universe .    in fig .",
    "[ mukhanov ] we reproduce the plots shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , adding the quintessence models described here .",
    "again , the quintessence models very closely mimic the k - essence model during the period for which they are equivalent ; for instance the second exponential potential model gives indistinguishable evolution of @xmath83 and @xmath68 back to redshifts of several hundred ( though note that this potential does not exhibit tracker behaviour ) .",
    "accordingly , observations studying the homogeneous evolution , such as supernovae observations , are not able to distinguish between such models . for the double exponential model",
    ", the mimicking is not perfect during the recent past and therefore one might be able to tell the difference .",
    "quintessence and k - essence are two attempts to explain , in terms of scalar fields , the current observation of an accelerating universe .",
    "although they are similar in that they both involve the dynamics of light scalar fields , they differ in that quintessence relies on precise functional forms for the potential of the field , whereas k - essence derives its particular behaviour from the presence of non - canonical kinetic terms associated with the field . given that both models attempt to explain the same observations , and that both models involve evolving scalar fields , a natural question that arises is whether it is possible to write one model in terms of the parameters of the other . in regimes where the effective equation of state parameter for the k - essence field becomes less than -1 ,",
    "such a relationship is not possible whilst maintaining conventional canonical kinetic terms for the quintessence fields , but for @xmath59 greater than -1 such equivalences may exist .",
    "in particular , in this paper we have addressed this question by attempting to rewrite k - essence models in terms of quintessence potentials , relating the two sets of fields through field redefinitions .",
    "our results are intriguing ; we have found a dynamically - equivalent action which has similarities with a canonical scalar field action and may be easier to study .",
    "we have examined two cases from the literature , and shown that during some regimes the homogeneous part of the k - essence field can behave exactly like a quintessence field , and have obtained exact equivalences in those cases .",
    "it could well prove impossible to differentiate between the two models , quintessence and k - essence , by measuring the evolution of the equation of state parameter . to distinguish between the models",
    ", it appears necessary to combine such studies with searches for subtle effects on the perturbations from the different sound speed in the two models @xcite .",
