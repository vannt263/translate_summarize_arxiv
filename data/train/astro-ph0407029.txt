    "planetary nebulae ( pns ) exhibit a wide variety of morphologies including round , elliptical , bipolar , and point - symmetric shapes @xcite .",
    "these main morphological classes can be accounted for by the interacting - stellar - winds model @xcite assuming that a pole - to - equator density gradient exists in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) wind @xcite .",
    "the detailed morphology of some pns has proven to be very complex and rich , however . by analyzing the morphology and kinematics of a pn ,",
    "it is possible to establish its physical structure and gain insight into its evolutionary stage .",
    "we have started a program to analyze high - resolution images and high - dispersion spectra of pns in multiple nebular lines , in order to determine the physical structure of pns . by comparing the results with hydrodynamical models , we hope to understand better the formation and evolution of pns",
    "the first pn we have studied is the owl nebula ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the second pn we have selected to study is ngc7662 , which is distinct from the owl nebula not only in morphology but also in excitation structure .",
    "ngc7662 has a bright main nebula that shows elliptical , double - shell morphology which is successfully reproduced by the interacting - stellar - winds model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the high surface brightness and moderately large size of this nebula , 30  in diameter , make it ideal for a detailed case study of the physical structure of elliptical pns .",
    "we have used narrow - band images and high - dispersion spectra of ngc7662 to build a 3-d spatio - kinematic model , derived the density and ionization fraction profiles , and interpreted the results in the light of the interacting - stellar - winds model .",
    "this paper reports our study of ngc7662 .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) archive contains images of ngc7662 obtained through narrow - band filters in the h@xmath3 , [ o  iii ] @xmath45007 , he  ii @xmath44686 , and [ n  ii ] @xmath46584 lines ( program i d # 6117 , pi : b.  balick ; program i d # 6943 , pi : s.  casertano ; program i d # 8390 , pi : a.  hajian ) .",
    "these filters have central wavelengths and fwhm bandwidths of 6565.6    and 29   ( h@xmath3 ) , 5012.9   and 37   ( [ o  iii ] ) , 4694.5   and 35   ( he  ii ) , and 6590.9   and 40   ( [ n   ii ] ) , respectively .",
    "we retrieved all archival _ hst _ images of ngc7662 in these lines and combined them respectively to result in total exposure times of 200 s ( h@xmath3 ) , 500 s ( [ o  iii ] ) , 200 s ( he  ii ) , and 2,800 s ( [ n  ii ] ) .",
    "the [ n  ii ] image is seriously contaminated by the bright h@xmath3 flux transmitted at the blue wing of the [ n  ii ] filter because ngc7662 is a high - excitation pn with [ n  ii]/h@xmath3 as low as @xmath50.007 in the shells and 0.116 in the [ n  ii]-bright knots @xcite .",
    "we have thus used the transmission curve of the [ n  ii ] filter to estimate this h@xmath3 contribution and subtracted a scaled h@xmath3 image from the [ n  ii ] image to produce a net [ n  ii ] image .",
    "the h@xmath3 , [ o  iii ] , he  ii , and the net [ n  ii ] images are presented in figure  1 .",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopic observations of ngc7662 were obtained with the echelle spectrograph on the 4-m telescope at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) on 1986 october 2123 .",
    "the spectrograph was used in the single - order , long - slit mode , covering only the [ o iii ] @xmath44959 , 5007 lines .",
    "the 79 line mm@xmath6 echelle grating and the long - focus red camera were used ; the resultant reciprocal dispersion was 2.47   mm@xmath6 .",
    "the spectra were recorded with the 800@xmath7800 ti @xmath8 ccd with a 2@xmath72 binning .",
    "the resulting pixel size of 30 @xmath9 m corresponded to a spatial scale of 033  pixel@xmath6 and a sampling of 4.5 km s@xmath6 pixel@xmath6 along the dispersion direction .",
    "a slit width of 150 @xmath9 m ( 1 ) was used , and the resultant instrumental fwhm was 9.5@xmath100.3 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the angular resolution , determined by the seeing , was 19 .",
    "we obtained four long - slit spectra of ngc7662 : one along the major axis ( pa=44 ) , two parallel to but with a 3  offset from the major axis , and one along the minor axis ( pa=135 ) .",
    "the slit positions are marked on the [ o  iii ] image in figure  1 .",
    "the exposure times were 300 s for the spectrum along the major axis , and 200 s for the other three .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf packages .",
    "the curvature - corrected , wavelength - calibrated echellograms are displayed in figure 2 .",
    "the velocities are referenced to the systemic velocity of ngc7662 .",
    "ngc7662 is a triple - shell nebula with a bright 179@xmath7124 inner shell enveloped by a 308@xmath7272 outer shell and surrounded by a faint spherical halo 134   in diameter @xcite .",
    "the major - to - minor axial ratio of the inner shell , @xmath51.4 , is noticeably larger than that of the outer shell , @xmath51.1 .",
    "the inner shell appears as a bright `` rim '' with an apparent thickness of @xmath525 , about half the length of the semi - minor axis .",
    "in contrast , the outer shell appears as an envelope attached to the inner shell , showing no limb - brightening .",
    "the morphology of the main nebula is complicated by the presence of  fast low - ionization emission regions ( fliers ) , \" as discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "our aim is to study the basic underlying structure of the nebula , therefore we select the sectors of the main nebula that are free of fliers . in particular , the analysis of the density and ionization structure of the nebula in section @xmath113.3 will be focused in its northwest quadrant .",
    "the kinematics of ngc7662 has been studied by @xcite using echelle spectra of the h@xmath3 and [ ] lines . as the h@xmath3 line has a large thermal width and",
    "the [ ] emission is dominated by the fliers , we have chosen to use [ o  iii ] to study the kinematics .",
    "our [ o  iii ] echellograms , displayed in figure 2 , show two kinematic systems corresponding to the inner and outer shells .",
    "the inner shell appears as a hollow position - velocity ellipse that has a marked tilt along the major axis ( pa @xmath12 ) , indicating that it is an expanding prolate ellipsoidal shell with its northeast side tilted towards us .",
    "the velocity dispersion within the shell is small ; for example , the blue- and red - shifted components at the central position have an observed velocity fwhm of 13 km  s@xmath6 , corresponding to an intrinsic velocity fwhm of 8 km  s@xmath6 ( after subtracting the instrumental and thermal widths ) .",
    "the brightness variations along the position - velocity ellipse can be naturally produced by the different line - of - sight path lengths through a prolate ellipsoidal shell @xcite .",
    "the outer shell also appears as a position - velocity ellipse , with a hollow center and thick filled rims , but without an obvious tilt .",
    "this echelle line morphology is consistent with a thick expanding shell with a small ellipticity . for sightlines through the thick shell rims , the broad line profiles are caused by the wide range of projection angles between the radial expansion velocity and the line of sight . near the shell center , the line profiles of the outer shell are superimposed on those of the bright inner shell ; however , the narrow widths of the blue- and red - shifted components indicate that the outer shell expands at least as fast as the inner shell and that the velocity dispersion in the outer shell is small as well .",
    "the brightness variations within the thick shell rims in the echellograms can be caused by a combination of small density and velocity variations within the shell",
    ". the echellograms also show faint unresolved emission beyond the visible boundary of the outer shell .",
    "this extension originates from the faint halo of ngc7662 , and its fwhm @xmath5 45  is unusually large for faint pn halos @xcite .",
    "the observed position - velocity ellipse of an expanding shell can constrain its geometry and kinematics . assuming a simple homologously expanding ellipsoidal shell ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) , it is possible to derive the axial ratios , inclination angles and expansion velocities of the shell . for the inner shell of ngc7662 ,",
    "the observed position - velocity ellipse is narrow and well defined , thus it can be directly compared with synthetic position - velocity ellipses to determine its geometry and kinematics .",
    "the outer shell is more difficult to model because its thick shell can be divided into multiple thin expanding shells , but the position - velocity ellipses of these thin shells can not be resolved from one another . in the owl nebula , it has been shown that the outermost layer of its outer shell ( most well defined in the low ionization [ n  ii ] line ) is characterized by a position - velocity ellipse that encloses the echelle line image of that shell ( paper i ) .",
    "we have thus adopted such an ellipse as the position - velocity ellipse of the outermost layer of the outer shell of ngc7662 .",
    "note that this assumption would be valid as long as there is no negative velocity gradient in the outer shell    using these models , we have produced synthetic position - velocity ellipses to match these observed in the inner shell and the outermost layer of the outer shell .",
    "the position - velocity ellipses of the best - fit models are overplotted in figure  2 , and the relevant parameters are summarized in table  1 .",
    "for the inner shell , we find that its major axis is tilted by 50  against the line of sight along pa 45 , and that its expansion velocities are 35@xmath103 km  s@xmath6 and 53@xmath106 km  s@xmath6 in the equatorial plane and along the pole , respectively . for the outer shell , the small line tilt implies a small ellipticity or a pole - on geometry . to overcome this ambiguity",
    ", we assumed that the inclination of the symmetry axis of the outer shell is the same as that of the inner shell @xcite and derived equatorial and polar expansion velocities for the outer shell of 50@xmath105 km  s@xmath6 and 60@xmath108 km  s@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the outer shell of ngc7662 has a smaller axial ratio than the inner shell , 1.2 versus 1.5 .",
    "the outermost layer of the outer shell expands faster than the inner shell , which may be expected for dense gas diffusing into the surroundings with much lower density .",
    "the inner shell has a kinematic age of @xmath5700@xmath14 yr , where @xmath15 is the distance in pc ( @xmath15=800 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the outer shell has a kinematic age of @xmath51,050@xmath14 yr .",
    "the spatio - kinematic models of ngc7662 deduced in @xmath113.2 can be used along with the observed surface brightness distribution in different emission lines to derive the density and ionization structure within this nebula .",
    "the northwest quadrant of ngc7662 provides the most appropriate region for this analysis because it has no fliers and shows smooth , featureless emission in both the direct images and [ o  iii ] echellogram .",
    "furthermore , this quadrant contains the minor axis along which the surface brightness distribution is less sensitive to the detailed shape and orientation of the nebular shells .",
    "the observed surface brightness profiles of the h@xmath3 , [ o  iii ] , he  ii , and [ n  ii ] lines along this minor axis are displayed in figure  3 .",
    "below is our analysis of the shell structure of ngc7662 along the minor axis in the northwest quadrant .    to derive the density and ionization structure from the observed surface brightness , we have adopted a distance of 800 pc @xcite , a logarithmic extinction @xmath16)=0.10 , and an electron temperature of 12,500 k @xcite .",
    "we have approximated the main nebula of ngc7662 by two ellipsoidal shells with the sizes , axial ratios and inclinations given in table  1 .",
    "we have further assumed that each shell consists of concentric sub - shells of constant density and ionization . as the surface brightness at a given radius @xmath17 includes contributions from sub - shells of radii @xmath18 , the derivation of the density is best done from outside in .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the h@xmath3 line is used to determine the radial profile of density @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt a power law for the density profile , i.e. , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 will be determined from the fit to the surface brightness profile .",
    "the presence of multiple kinks in the h@xmath3 surface brightness profile implies that the density profile can not be described by a single power law throughout the nebula .",
    "we have thus derived the density profile piecewisely .",
    "we experimented various power - law index @xmath22 and find that @xmath23 and 1 provide the best fits for the inner and outer shell , respectively .",
    "the best - fit density profile is shown in figure  4 .",
    "the corresponding surface brightness profile , overplotted in figure  3 , is in good agreement with the observed h@xmath3 profile from radii of 2  to 14 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the density profile in the outer shell is better described by a power law index of 1 , instead of 2 , as expected for an agb wind with constant velocity and mass - loss rate .",
    "three segments marked by small density jumps at radii @xmath510@xmath24 and @xmath512@xmath25 are present in the density profile of the outer shell . from the outer shell to the inner shell",
    "there is a sharp increase in density .",
    "the inner shell is best described with a constant density @xmath55,000 @xmath26 over a thickness @xmath27 , but the density drops off steeply at its inner edge .",
    "this shell density is within the range determined from spectrophotometric observations of the [ s  ii ] doublet , @xmath54,000 @xmath26 for the inner shell and @xmath286,000 @xmath26 in isolated dense regions @xcite .",
    "the density in the central cavity is low , but it can not be determined with certainty because the surface brightness at the central region of the nebula is overwhelmed by the emission from the inner and outer shells .",
    "the sharp leading edge of the inner shell is in agreement with its supersonic expansion within the inner edge of the outer shell .    the density profile and the assumed ellipsoidal shell geometry can be used to determine the ionized mass in the inner and outer shells .",
    "the mass in the inner shell is @xmath50.01 m@xmath2 , while that of the outer shell is @xmath50.04 m@xmath2 . to test whether the inner shell consists entirely of swept - up agb wind ,",
    "we have extrapolated the density profile of the outer shell to the center and determined the swept - up mass .",
    "an excellent agreement exists between the expected swept - up mass and the mass in the inner shell , suggesting that no extraneous mass - loss is needed to form the inner shell .",
    "the ionization structure of ngc7662 can be studied using the observed surface brightness profiles of the he  ii , [ o  iii ] , and [ n  ii ] lines ( fig .",
    "the surface brightness , in conjunction with electron temperature and density , can be used to derive the ionic abundance .",
    "we have adopted appropriate electron temperatures for lines of different excitations : 14,000 k and 11,000 k for the high - excitation [ o  iii ] and he  ii lines in the inner and outer shells , respectively , and 8,500 k for the low - ionization [ n  ii ] line @xcite .",
    "the ionic abundances determined using these temperatures and the above derived densities are then divided by the corresponding elemental abundances @xcite to compute the ionization fractions of he@xmath29 , o@xmath29 , and n@xmath30 shown in figure  4 .",
    "an inspection of fig .",
    "4 shows that the ionization fraction of he@xmath29 is rather constant and greater than 0.8 through the nebula , while those of o@xmath29 and n@xmath31 increase outwards , as expected from stratified ionization .",
    "it must be noted that the detailed level and shape of the ionization fraction profiles depends on the choice of elemental abundances and electron temperatures .",
    "the large ionization fraction of he@xmath29 , for instance , may imply full ionization of he , as typically predicted by ionization models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with he abundances smaller by @xmath510% than those here adopted .",
    "similarly , variations of the electron temperature with radius in ngc7662 , as reported by @xcite , may affect the derived ionization fraction profiles , especially those of o@xmath29 and n@xmath31 , so that larger values of electron temperature mimic larger ionization fractions of o@xmath29 and n@xmath31 .",
    "the increased ionization fraction of o@xmath29 in the outermost regions of ngc7662 seems real , however , as the electron temperature is known to decrease outwards @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sharp increase of the ionization fraction of o@xmath29 at @xmath17 @xmath5 7  signifies the transition of ionization stage at the edge of the o@xmath32 strmgren sphere , although the exact shape of the o@xmath29 ionization fraction profile and the radius of the o@xmath32 strmgren sphere might be questionable .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of the physical structure of pns have been carried out in the framework of interacting stellar winds taking into account the evolution and mass - loss history of the central star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in these simulations , the fast stellar wind excavates a central cavity and snowplows the agb wind to produce a double - shell nebula . the inner shell , being the swept - up agb wind , is denser than the outer shell .",
    "the outer shell has a relatively flat density profile as its sudden ionization has resulted in strong pressure gradients that have modified the original @xmath33 law .",
    "this overall structure is observed in ngc7662 ; the h@xmath3 image and echelle spectra are similar to those simulated by @xcite , and the mass in the inner shell is in agreement with the expected swept - up mass of the agb wind .",
    "we attempt to quantitatively compare the density profile and kinematic structure of ngc7662 to pn models .",
    "the density profile of ngc7662 is characterized by :    * a density contrast of @xmath52 between the outer and inner shells , * an inner shell with a thickness of 0.012 pc , about 0.30.5 times the shell radius , and * an almost flat density profile in the outer shell , significantly flatter than the @xmath33 law .",
    "the radial profile of the expansion velocity of ngc7662 can not be determined observationally because of the limited spatial resolution of the echelle observations and the non - negligible thermal line widths .",
    "our analysis in @xmath34 provides only the following basic kinematic characteristics of ngc7662 :    * the inner shell has a small internal velocity dispersion , and expands at 35  and 53  along the equator and poles , respectively ; and * the outer shell also has small internal velocity dispersions , and expands at similar velocities to the inner shell , but its outermost layer expands faster , at 50  and 60  along the equator and poles , respectively .    we have compared the density profile and kinematic structure of ngc7662 to those synthesized from the @xcite models of spherical pns that take into account different initial conditions and central star masses . they have divided the pn evolution into four phases : phase i corresponds to the youngest stage when the central star is still too cool to ionize the agb wind ; phase ii corresponds to the compression stage when an ionized double - shell structure is visible ; phase iii is the stage when the central star reaches the maximum temperature and the inner - to - outer shell density contrast is the highest ; and in phase iv recombination starts and a single shell is observed possibly with a recombination halo .",
    "the extended outer shell , high densities , density profile , and velocity structure of ngc7662 are compatible with those of a pn at phase ii evolving toward phase iii ( compare to fig",
    ".  7 of perinotto et al . ) .",
    "@xcite modeled pns for different central - star masses and presented their results in figures 1316 .",
    "we can rule out a central star mass much below 0.6 m@xmath2 because the densities in ngc7662 , a few 10@xmath35 @xmath26 , are more than an order of magnitude higher than those expected from pns with low - mass central stars .",
    "we can also rule out a central star mass as high as 0.80.9 m@xmath2 , because such pns have higher shell densities and shorter double - shell lifetime than ngc7662 .",
    "the observed properties of ngc7662 are most compatible with the model for a 0.605 m@xmath2 central star",
    ".    we can also compare ngc7662 to the @xcite models for a 0.605 m@xmath2 central star with different agb mass loss rates ( their fig .",
    "10 ) . the density and velocity profiles of ngc7662 are most compatible with the model with an agb mass loss rate of @xmath36 m@xmath2 yr@xmath37 and wind velocity of 10 ; however , the expansion velocities of ngc7662 are much higher than the @xmath515 km s@xmath6 expansion velocities from this model",
    ". a higher shell expansion velocity can be achieved if the agb wind velocity is higher , and to maintain the same agb wind density profile a proportionally higher agb mass loss rate is required .",
    "it is possible that the agb wind velocity of ngc7662 was 3050 , and the agb mass loss rate was @xmath38 m@xmath2 yr@xmath6 . future models of ngc7662 ought to consider these agb wind properties .",
    "ngc7662 is a triple - shell pn with a bright inner shell ( or rim ) surrounded by an outer shell and a faint , large halo .",
    "we have analyzed high - resolution images and spectra of the inner and outer shells of ngc7662 , and constructed 3-d spatio - kinematic models for its inner shell and the outermost layer of the outer shell . both can be modeled as expanding prolate ellipsoidal shells with the northeast end of the major axis tilted toward us .",
    "we have further used the spatio - kinematic models and the h@xmath3 , , [ ] , and [ ] surface brightness profiles to determine the density profile and ionization structure along the minor axis .",
    "the density and kinematic structure of ngc7662 are compared to @xcite models of spherical pns .",
    "we find that ngc7662 is in their phase ii evolutionary stage ( the compression stage ) , as its outer shell is still fairly extended , but may be close to phase iii evolutionary stage as its inner shell does not seem to be compressed strongly from its interior .",
    "ngc7662 is most compatible with models for a central star mass of 0.605 m@xmath2 .",
    "future models with higher agb wind velocities , such as 3050 , are needed for detailed comparisons with ngc7662 .",
