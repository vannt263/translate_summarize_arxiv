    "the disruption of a star by a massive black hole ( bh ) is one of the most spectacular examples of the tidal phenomena ( komossa & bade 1999 ; donley et al .",

    "a star that wanders too close to a massive bh is torn apart by gravitational forces .",
    "almost half the debris would escape on hyperbolic orbits , while the other half would traverse elliptic orbits and returns to periapsis before producing a conspicuous flare ( e.g. rees 1988 ) .",
    "the disruption process has been numerically investigated in detail ( evans & kochanek 1989 ; laguna et al . 1993 ; ayal et al .",

    "2011 ) .",
    "once a star gets deeply inside the tidal radius of a bh , the tidal force dominates over the self - gravity and thermal pressure of the star .",
    "a very simplified description of the disruption process could be the encounter between a star cluster ( or a cluster of point masses ) and a massive bh .",
    "the simplest case consists of a binary and a massive bh in which after the tidal disruption , one star would escape to the infinity , while the other could be captured by the bh .",
    "this is actually one of the leading models for the formation of hypervelocity stars ( hills 1988 ; yu & tremaine 2003 ) .",

    "hypervelocity stars are stars with a high velocity exceeding the escape velocity of the galaxy . after the discovery of such stars in a survey of blue stars within the galactic halo ( brown et al .",

    "these investigations so far have used three - body simulations or analytic methods that relied on results from three - body simulations .",
    "the six orders of magnitude mass ratio between the galactic center bh and the binary stars allows us to formulate the problem in the restricted three - body approximation . in a previous paper ( sari et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter skr ) , we have shown that the approximation is efficient and useful to understand how binary stars behave at the tidal breakup when the binary s center of mass approaches the bh in a parabolic orbit . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the approximation for orbits with arbitrary eccentricity .",
    "this enables us to give a complete picture of the ejection and capture process .",
    "we also provide the ejection and capture probability distributions that can be simply rescaled in terms of binary masses , their initial separation and the binary - to - black hole mass ratio when applied to a specific system .",
    "our method is computationally more efficient than full three - body simulations , and it is easier to grasp the nature of the tidal interaction .    in  2 , we outline the restricted three - body approximation . in  3 , we evaluate how much energy each member gains or loses at the tidal encounter and we discuss how the energy change evaluated for a parabolic orbit can be used to study non - parabolic orbit cases , and in  4 , we give qualitative discussion on the ejection and capture preferences . in  5 , we study high velocity encounters . in  6 ,",
    "the numerical results are discussed . in  7",
    ", we use our results to describe the capture process of triton around neptune . finally , in  8 , we summarize the results .",
    "the equation of motion for each of the binary members is given by @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the respective distance from the massive point mass with @xmath1 .",
    "we will call the point mass the black hole ( bh ) , though the binary is assumed to travel well outside the event horizon and our results can be applied to any systems which include a newtonian massive point mass .",
    "the equation for the distance between the two @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the two masses are much closer to each other , and to the trajectory of the center of mass of the binary @xmath11 , than each of them to the bh . both energy and orbit obtained under the approximation are fairly accurate except a part of the orbit just around the periapsis passage ( see skr for the details ) .",
    "linearizing the first two terms of equation ( [ vecr ] ) around the center of mass orbit @xmath11 , we find that the zero orders cancel out .",

    "we are interested in the fate of stars in a binary , following its encounter with a massive bh . in order to study the ejection and capture process",
    ", we evaluate the energies of the stars as functions of time .",
    "when the binary is at a large distance from the bh , the binary members rotate around their center of mass which gradually accelerates towards the bh .",
    "the specific self - gravity energy of the binary is about @xmath32",
    ". analytic arguments ( skr ) suggest that at the tidal breakup one member gets additional energy of the order of @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the velocity of the center of mass at the tidal radius @xmath35 .",
    "if the binary approaches the bh with negligible orbital energy , the velocity is @xmath36 .",
    "the additional energy is larger than the self - gravity energy by a factor of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , we will neglect the self - gravity term in the following energy estimates .",
    "this treatment is valid as long as the binary is injected into the orbit @xmath11 at a radius much larger than the tidal radius .",
    "the energy of one binary member @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 linearizing the kinetic and potential energy terms around the orbit of the center of mass @xmath40 and using the initial energy @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath42 since in our limit the total energy of the system is @xmath43 , considering @xmath44 , we get @xmath45 using our rescaled variables , the additional energy is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the penetration factor which is useful to characterize the tidal encounter .",
    "once the binary dissolves , @xmath48 becomes a constant because the body is eventually moving only under the conservative force of the bh .",
    "hereafter , the energy change @xmath49 means the constant value after the disruption , otherwise we specify it .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eq : r_vec ] ) indicates that the negative of a solution @xmath50 is also a solution .",
    "the energies @xmath51 are also linear in the coordinates .",
    "therefore , another binary starting with a phase difference @xmath52 will have the same additional energy in absolute value but opposite in sign .",
    "a uniform distribution in the binary phase implies that , when the binary is disrupted , each body has a @xmath53 chance of gaining energy ( and a @xmath53 chance of losing energy ) .    as we have discussed",
    ", the typical energy change is larger than the self - gravity energy by a factor of @xmath54 , it is of order of @xmath55 .",
    "then , the dimensionless quantity @xmath48 is an order - of - unity constant after the disruption .",
    "its exact value depends on orbital parameters , but for qualitative discussion we just need to know that @xmath48 is about unity .",
    "later we will numerically show that @xmath48 is an order - of - unity in the relevant parameter regime , the energy change is as large as @xmath56 in a very narrow range of the binary phase ( see figure 7 in skr ) where the binary members once come close to each other before they break up .",
    "however , the phase - averaged value @xmath57 , and numerical values will be used to estimate the ejection and capture probabilities .",
    "rescaling energies by the typical value of the energy change , the energies of the binary members after the disruption are given by @xmath58 where bar denotes energy scaled by @xmath59 .",
    "an interesting outcome of the encounter between a binary system and a massive bh is the `` three - body exchange reaction '' ( heggie 1975 ; hills 1975 ) where one member of the binary is expelled and its place is taken by the bh , i.e. one binary member is captured by the bh and the other is ejected to infinity . in order for a member @xmath38 to escape from the bh , the initial binding energy should be smaller than the energy gain : @xmath60 .",
    "the same condition is required when a member of the binary in a hyperbolic orbit loses energy and it is bound around the bh .",
    "therefore , when we discuss the ejection or capture process associated with a massive bh , the absolute value of the initial energy should be comparable or less than unit : @xmath61 .",
    "since the energy , penetration factor ( periapsis radius ) and eccentricity are related by eq ( [ eccentricity ] ) or equivalently : @xmath62 only two of them are the independent parameters to describe the binary orbit . considering @xmath61 together with the mass ratio @xmath63 and the tidal disruption condition @xmath64 , the eccentricity should be almost unity @xmath65 for a member @xmath38 to be ejected or captured where @xmath66 is the mass of the partner ( @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) .",
    "if we use the semi - major axis @xmath71 , the condition can be rewritten as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is negative for hyperbolic orbits .",
    "such orbits differ very little from parabolic orbits with the same periapsis distance , especially around the tidal radius and inside it .",
    "therefore , the energy change @xmath48 is expected to be almost identical to that for the parabolic case . as long as we study the exchange reaction , we can approximate @xmath48 by the parabolic results @xmath74 .",
    "however , @xmath75 does not necessarily mean @xmath76 .",
    "in general , we need to take into account the offset of the final energy due to the non - zero initial energy , which would affect the ejection and capture probabilities .",
    "the final energies are approximately given by @xmath77",
    "we here consider a simple question : which member is ejected or captured if an unequal - mass binary is tidally disrupted by a massive bh ? if @xmath78 ( hyperbolic orbits ) , one binary member could lose energy and get captured by the bh , the other flies away with a larger energy . assuming a uniform distribution in the binary phase , each member has a @xmath53 chance of losing energy ( and gaining energy ) .",
    "however , since the lighter one ( the secondary ) has a smaller initial energy , it is preferentially captured and the heavier one ( the primary ) has more chance to be ejected .    for elliptical orbits , by considering a plausible semi - major axis @xmath73",
    ", we can obtain tighter constraints on the eccentricity and energy , compared to the requirements from the exchange reaction .",
    "this is particularly relevant for studies of hypervelocity stars . if @xmath73 is around the radius of influence of the bh @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the local stellar velocity dispersion , for the galactic center , it is about @xmath81 a few parsecs @xmath82 for @xmath83 several solar radii . then , we get @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "our previous estimates based on parabolic orbits are appropriate to study the production of hypervelocity stars for which an equal ejection chance is expected ( skr ) .",
    "when the semi - major axis is as small as @xmath86 , the initial energy @xmath87 would be of the order of unity as we have discussed and it affects the ejection preference .",
    "since the secondary has less negative initial energy , it is preferentially ejected .    recently , antonini et al .",
    "( 2011 ) performed n - body simulations of unequal mass binaries with @xmath88 , @xmath89 or @xmath90 and @xmath91au in elliptical orbits around a supermassive bh @xmath92 .",
    "they find that the initial distance of the binary from the central bh plays a fundamental role in determining which member is ejected : for a large initial distance @xmath93pc or equivalently @xmath94 , the ejection probability is almost independent on the stellar mass , while for @xmath95pc or @xmath96 , the lighter star is preferentially ejected . considering that the ejection probability significantly decreases if @xmath73 becomes smaller than @xmath97 , these results are consistent with our analysis .    these ejection preferences for hyperbolic and elliptic orbits are naturally understood if we consider a large mass ratio for the binary members .",
    "the energy of the primary practically does not change at the tidal encounter . whether it is ejected or captured after the tidal breakup simply depends on the initial energy @xmath98 , while the secondary might have a chance to make a transition between a bound and unbound orbits around the bh ( bromley et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the large mass ratio limit",
    ", the exchange reaction condition ( i.e. the transition condition for the secondary ) is @xmath99 or equivalently @xmath100 .",
    "if a binary has a large orbital energy @xmath101 , both members are ejected after the bh encounter as a binary system or two independent objects .",
    "is a large negative value , both members are captured after the disruption . since the velocity at the tidal radius is reduced @xmath102 , the energy change should be smaller @xmath103 . ]",
    "although the high energy regime is not important in the context of the three - body exchange reaction , we discuss the regime to clarify the parameter dependence of the numerical results in the next section .",
    "a high orbital energy @xmath104 affects the velocity of their center of mass at the encounter @xmath105 .",
    "then , the tidal disruption radius ( i.e. where a binary is disrupted ) can be defined in three different ways . we here order them from a large to small radius . ( a ) _ relative acceleration : _ the radius at which the bh tidal force becomes comparable to the mutual gravity of the binary .",
    "this is @xmath106 .",
    "( b ) _ relative velocity : _ the radius at which the tidal force induces the relative velocity between the binary members comparable to the binary escape velocity @xmath107 .",
    "( c ) _ relative position : _ the radius at which the difference in position increases by more than the initial binary separation .    the duration that the center of mass is around @xmath108 is of order of @xmath109 . during this period ,",
    "the tidal acceleration of the relative motion of the binary members by the bh is of order of @xmath110 .",
    "the two radii ( b ) and ( c ) can be estimated from two conditions : @xmath111 and @xmath112 , provided that the duration of the encounter is comparable or shorter than the binary rotation time - scale : @xmath113 .",
    "if the energy is high @xmath114 , these conditions give @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "since they should be larger than the periapsis distance , only the cases that satisfy @xmath117 for the radius ( b ) or @xmath118 for the radius ( c ) lead to the disruption .",
    "the radius ( c ) is basically the place at which the orbit of the center of mass makes its turn ( i.e. the periapsis ) .",
    "if the energy is low @xmath119 , all the estimates give the original tidal radius @xmath106 .",
    "when we discuss the energy change @xmath120 at the tidal encounter , there are two important points which we should emphasize .",
    "first , the energy of each of the binary members in the bh frame changes only due to the mutual force between the binary members .",
    "secondly most of the work done by one member on the other , which is @xmath120 , is done outside the tidal radius @xmath106 .",
    "the mutual force is of order of @xmath121 . during the binary rotation time - scale @xmath122 ,",
    "the force acts over a length @xmath123 in the bh frame .",
    "therefore , the work is @xmath124 . since the direction of the mutual force changes with the binary rotation",
    ", @xmath125 oscillates with the amplitude of @xmath126 .",
    "when the binary is disrupted , @xmath120 becomes a constant value which is basically determined by the binary phase at the disruption . then , we might expect that the final value of @xmath120 is a sinusoidal function of the binary phase for circular binaries . as we will see later ,",
    "this is actually the case for the high energy encounters .",
    "even with the largest estimate of the tidal radius ( i.e. @xmath106 ) , the duration of the encounter @xmath127 is shorter than the binary rotation time - scale by a factor of @xmath128 .",
    "the work during the encounter is negligible compared to the work @xmath126 which has been done outside @xmath106 . on the other hand , in the low energy regime , the duration of the encounter is comparable to the binary rotation time - scale . considering that at the encounter the orbits of the members in the comoving frame of their center of mass should be significantly deformed from the original orbits ( e.g. circular orbits ) before they finally break up , the work during the encounter could induce deviation of @xmath129 from a simple sinusoidal function .",
    "however , the typical value is still expected to be about @xmath130 .    in both the low and high energy regime ,",
    "the typical energy change is given in a dimensionless form by @xmath131 where we have assumed @xmath132 to estimate @xmath133 .",
    "in the high energy regime , the disruption might happen at a smaller radius , but @xmath133 is determined by the orbital energy and it is insensitive to the choice of @xmath108 .",
    "when @xmath134 , the energy change becomes much larger than unity .",
    "however , the energy gain is not significant compared to the original energy @xmath135 , and one finds that the tidal encounter is not an efficient acceleration process anymore .    in the high energy regime",
    ", the energy change eq ( [ dimlessde ] ) can be evaluated by assuming that a binary is abruptly disrupted at the tidal radius @xmath106 , since the work during the tidal encounter is negligible . for a circular coplanar binary : @xmath136 and @xmath137",
    ", we obtain @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the binary phase at the tidal radius , @xmath140 is the negative value solution of @xmath141 and the signature indicates a prograde ( + ) or retrograde ( - ) orbit .",
    "this is a sinusoidal function of the binary phase as we expected , and the square of its amplitude is @xmath142 which is larger for prograde orbits and the difference between prograde and retrograde orbits becomes smaller for deep penetrators @xmath143 , because in this limit the binary center of mass approaches the bh in an almost radial fashion .    if the disruption is abrupt , the ejection and capture preference could be roughly illustrated in terms of velocity ( e.g morbidelli 2006 ; agnor & hamilton 2006 ) .",
    "the binary members rotate around their center of mass , such that their own motion is half of time with and half of time against , the motion of the center of mass @xmath144 .",
    "the net velocity of the members relative to the bh is accordingly increased or reduced .",
    "since the secondary has a higher rotation velocity , it has more chance that the net velocity exceeds or drops below the escape velocity from the bh .",
    "then , it is preferentially ejected to infinity or captured in a bound orbit . however , for the full discussion of the process , we also need to take into account the variation in the escape velocity or the variation in the potential .",
    "the displacement of order @xmath145 in the position of each member of the binary , at a distance of about @xmath106 from the bh , results in a change in gravitational energy of @xmath146 , this is comparable to the variation in the kinetic energy .",
    "as we have done , it should be easier to discuss the overall effect in the energy domain . in our formula , the energy change ( [ e2 ] ) includes both the variation of kinetic energy and potential energy . for prograde orbits ,",
    "the kinetic and potential terms cooperate and the net energy change is larger , the member on the `` outside track '' is expected to be ejected and its partner is captured ( the `` outside track '' could be well defined especially when the orbital energy is large because the duration of the encounter is much shorter than the binary rotation time - scale ) . on the other hand , for retrograde orbits the variation in the gravitational energy would counteract that in the kinetic energy .",
    "in this paper we focus on results for circular coplanar binaries , though our formulae can be used to study the evolution of a binary with arbitrary orbital parameters .",
    "the orbit of a binary is assumed to be initially circular in the comoving frame of the binary center of mass .",
    "the center of mass of the binary is in a prograde or retrograde orbit around the bh ( see skr for the details of the numerical setup ) .",
    "for @xmath147 the problem can be reduced to the motion of a single particle in a time - dependent potential ( `` the restricted three - body approximation '' ) described by the equations  ( [ ddotx])-([ddotz ] ) and ( [ dotf ] ) .",
    "the energy change , eq ( [ dimlessde ] ) , depends only on the penetration factor @xmath148 , the eccentricity @xmath20 , the initial binary phase @xmath149 , and the binary rotation direction .",
    "as we have shown , when a binary member is captured by the bh and the other is ejected , we can further reduce the number of the parameters by assuming @xmath150 to approximate the additional energy .",
    "the effect of the eccentricity @xmath151 is taken into account through the non - zero initial orbital energy of the center of mass .",
    "this method ( [ eipara ] ) will be called `` the parabolic approximation '' . for a large orbital energy @xmath104 , `` the sudden disruption approximation '' ( [ eq : sudden ] ) would become valid , but the three - body exchange reaction does not take place in this regime . in all the numerical codes the time evolution of objects are evaluated by using a fourth - order runge - kutta integration scheme .",
    "we have tested the restricted three - body approximation against the full three - body simulations of a binary evolving around a massive object ( skr ) .",
    "the full three - body orbit is accurately reproduced by the approximation equations , and the energy change , for example , differs at a @xmath152 level when the exchange reaction happens .",
    "the comparison of the energy change between the full three - body and restricted three - body results is shown in figure [ fig : deltae ] .",
    "since they are in an excellent agreement , in the following discussion , we will use the restricted three - body approximation to test the parabolic and the sudden disruption approximation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : deltae ] , one could notice the symmetry @xmath153 .",
    "the top panel shows that the energy change for @xmath154 is very similar to the parabolic case with the same @xmath148 especially if we take into account the phase shifts for the parabolic calculations in the top panel of figure [ fig : deltae ] .",
    "as long as a simulation starts at a large enough radius @xmath155 , the results are largely independent of it .",
    "however , a problem arises when we compare the phase dependence .",
    "if we assume the same initial radius for the non - parabolic cases , it takes a slightly different time for the binary to reach the vicinity of the bh , the binary interacts with the bh with a slightly different binary phase .",
    "we have adjusted the initial radii as the periapsis passage happens at the same time ( @xmath156 for @xmath157 and @xmath158 for @xmath159 ) . since",
    "this adjustment has been done neglecting the bh tidal field , the actual phase at the periapsis is still different from the parabolic case .",
    "this induces the phase shifts in the figure . in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : deltae ]",
    ", @xmath160 is assumed for the restricted three - body calculations , and in each case the binary phase is adjusted as the results take the maximum value at @xmath161 . ] .",
    "when the three - body exchange reaction happens , the value @xmath162 should be very small , in such a case non - parabolic results tend toward a perfect overlapping with the parabolic results . in the bottom panel , the energy change in the high energy regime : @xmath163 is shown .",
    "the sudden disruption approximation well reproduces the three - body results , except for some notable spikes .",
    "most binaries are disrupted at the tidal encounter with a bh .",
    "however , there are always finite phase regions where binaries survive ( skr ) .",
    "the narrow gaps in the top panel of fig [ fig : deltae ] correspond to such regions .",
    "although it is not evident in the bottom panel , very narrow gaps exist just in the middle of the spikes .",
    "the high energy regime is usually realized with a deep penetrator @xmath143 .",
    "in such a case , we can ignore the self - gravity term @xmath164 in eqs ( [ ddotx])-([ddotz ] ) , and free solutions are obtained .",
    "actually , one of the free solutions : @xmath165 , which corresponds to the case that binary members have the same trajectory but are slightly separated in time , dominates around the periapsis passage ( skr ) .",
    "then , the binary is once disrupted at the tidal encounter , but after the periapsis passage at @xmath31 , they come close to each other .",
    "if we fine - tune the initial binary phase , they form a binary again .",
    "this produces the narrow gaps at the spikes .",
    "if the binary phase is slightly different from the fine - tuned values , they almost form a binary , but they eventually break up .",
    "the additional work at @xmath166 due to the mutual forces between the binary members produces the notable spikes .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : d - dep ] shows the phase - averaged absolute value of the energy change @xmath167 , as a function of the penetration factor @xmath148 . the average is taken over the phase space where binaries are disrupted .",
    "we alternatively fix the orbital eccentricity or the orbital energy @xmath168 . for a given eccentricity , a smaller @xmath148 corresponds to a larger orbital energy , while for a given orbital energy , it corresponds to @xmath169 . for @xmath170 ,",
    "the energy change remains of the order of unity as we expect from eq ( [ degene ] ) ( see the black and green lines and the green crosses for the whole disruption range , and the red lines and red crosses for @xmath171 ) . for @xmath172 , instead ,",
    "@xmath167 increases towards smaller @xmath148 ( the red lines and red crosses for @xmath173 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the disruption probability ( bottom panel ) becomes almost 100@xmath174 for @xmath172 .",
    "on the other hand , for the fixed energies @xmath175 and @xmath176 , the disruption chance is about @xmath177 even in the deep penetration limit @xmath143 ( the black and green lines ) .",
    "note that in the sudden disruption approximation the disruption probability is 100% by definition , and we do not show it in the bottom panel . for our choice of @xmath178 ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath167 always remains very similar to the parabolic orbit case , even when we use the sudden disruption approximation especially for small @xmath148 ( the green crosses in the top panel ) .",
    "the same applies to the disruption probability function , but the sudden disruption approximation overestimates the disruption probability . as it is well known , the retrograde binaries tend to be more stable against the tidal encounter .    for a given initial energy of a binary member @xmath179 ( in the following discussion we drop the subscript @xmath180 of the initial energy for simplicity ) , considering the symmetry of @xmath181 , the probability @xmath182 that the member is ejected after the tidal encounter is determined by the fraction of the binary phase region @xmath183 $ ] that satisfies @xmath184 , while the capture probability @xmath185 is determined by the fraction satisfying @xmath186 .",
    "the sum is equal to the disruption probability : @xmath187 . since @xmath188 ,",
    "once we evaluate the ejection probability @xmath182 for negative and zero energy , the distribution for positive energy @xmath189 and the capture probability for any energy @xmath190 are also obtained .",
    "the disruption probability is @xmath191 .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : peje ] how the ejection probability of a binary member behaves for different penetration factors and binary orientations .",
    "since the orbital energy and the eccentricity are not independent parameters when @xmath148 is fixed : @xmath192 , we need to assume a smaller eccentricity , in principle , for a larger negative orbital energy @xmath193 ( or larger negative @xmath135 ) to estimate the energy change @xmath194 , the disruption probability and the ejection probability .",
    "however , the energy change and the disruption probability are not so sensitive to the eccentricity , we thus evaluate them by using parabolic orbit results ( the parabolic approximation ) when the three - body exchange reaction happens . in the figure , the parabolic approximation calculations ( the lines ) are in a good agreement with the restricted three - body calculations ( the circles ) . for prograde orbits ,",
    "the energy change @xmath195 is more sensitive to the phase @xmath149 around zero points , only very narrow phase regions satisfy @xmath103 ( see fig [ fig : deltae ] top panel ) , then the ejection probabilities have a plateau around @xmath196 . the long low energy tail of the prograde @xmath197 case ( the green solid line ) reflects the fact that the energy gain would be quite large for a narrow binary phase region for this case .",
    "the ejection ( capture ) probability for @xmath198 is a monotonically increasing ( decreasing ) function of the energy @xmath193 .",
    "the probabilities rapidly change around @xmath199 and their function form depends mainly on @xmath148 and the binary rotation direction .",
    "when we discuss an actual astrophysical system , it is more physically intuitive to use the semi - major axis rather than the energy @xmath193 or @xmath135 . by specifying the semi - major axis and the mass ratios , the ejection ( or capture ) probability and the energy after the disruption can be evaluated .",
    "the orbital energy @xmath135 is given by @xmath200 @xmath201 and @xmath202 will be assumed in this section .",
    "figure [ fig : ave ] shows the characteristics of the ejection process when a binary approaches the bh in elliptic orbits . to evaluate the ejection probability ( the top panel ) ,",
    "we have not distinguished which member is ejected . since both members are never ejected together when @xmath203 , it is just the sum of the ejection probabilities of the two members . for parabolic orbits ,",
    "one of the members is always ejected if the binary is disrupted , then the black solid line indicates the disruption probability .",
    "as @xmath204 becomes smaller , the deviation of the orbit from the parabolic one becomes larger .",
    "the effect of the non - zero orbital energy is expected to become significant around @xmath205 , and the ejection probability rapidly decreases .",
    "the middle panel indicates which member in a binary is ejected more frequently .",
    "there is no preference in the parabolic case .",
    "however , the secondary is preferentially ejected for small @xmath204 .",
    "the phase - averaged ejection energy is shown in the bottom panel .",
    "for parabolic orbits this is equivalent to the phase - averaged energy change @xmath167 .",
    "if we consider @xmath190 , it is possible to interpret figure [ fig : ave ] as the capture probability and capture preference for the hyperbolic orbit cases with the same semi - major axises in absolute value .",
    "the phase - averaged energy ( the bottom panel ) gives the absolute values of the averaged capture energies .",
    "over 150 satellites are orbiting the giant planets in the solar system .",
    "about one - third of these are classified as regular , with nearly circular and planar orbits .",
    "the majority of the satellites , however , are irregular ones which are more distant from their planet and typically have larger eccentricities and/or inclination .",
    "interestingly , a large fraction of the irregular satellites orbit their planet in the retrograde direction ( jewitt & haghighipour 2007 ) .",
    "triton , neptune s largest moon , is among them . because of the retrograde orbit and composition similar to pluto s",
    ", triton is thought to have been captured from the kuiper belt .",
    "recently agnor and hamilton ( 2006 ) demonstrated that the gravitational encounter between neptune and a binary system , which had included triton as a member , is an effective mechanism to capture triton .",
    "since the mass ratio between neptune @xmath206 and triton @xmath207 is reasonably large @xmath208 , we here revisit the capture process from the point of view of the restricted three - body problem .",
    "we consider an encounter between neptune and a binary system with @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the binary is assumed to be in a prograde hyperbolic orbit with the periapsis @xmath212 where @xmath213 km and @xmath214 km are the radii of triton and neptune , respectively .",
    "this set of the parameters are identical to what agnor and hamilton ( 2006 ) have assumed to obtain their figure 2 .",
    "since the tidal radius is about @xmath215 , the penetration factor for the orbit is @xmath216 . for a given encounter velocity at infinity @xmath217",
    ", we evaluate the binary disruption chance and the capture probability of the binary members . the velocity at infinity @xmath218 km / s is related to the semi - major axis of the hyperbolic orbit as @xmath219 which is about the critical value @xmath220 for the three - body exchange reaction .",
    "the numerical results are shown in the figure [ fig : triton ] , and the relevant case ( the solid lines in the top panel ) is in good agreement with the figure 2 in agnor and hamilton ( 2006 ) .",
    "since the disruption chance depends mainly on @xmath148 , for the fixed @xmath148 , it is constant @xmath221 . for high velocities , the probability for the primary drops sharply , while it is still @xmath222 for the secondary because of its smaller initial energy @xmath193 .",
    "if we assume a larger secondary mass @xmath223 , the energy change @xmath120 at the encounter would be larger .",
    "the @xmath53 capture probability of the primary now extends to higher velocities , while the capture rate of the secondary is similar because the primary mass is fixed ( the dashed lines ) .",
    "the black dashed - dotted lines indicate the capture probabilities obtained by using the parabolic approximation for @xmath210 . even at the high velocity @xmath224 km / s or equivalently high eccentricity @xmath225",
    ", it reasonably agrees with the restricted three - body results . in the bottom panel ,",
    "the capture probability is shown as a function of a scaled velocity @xmath226 .",
    "although the difference among them is small , if the parabolic approximation is used for all the cases , the solid and dashed lines should perfectly overlap with the black dashed - dotted line .    at the disruption ,",
    "each member is captured with @xmath53 probability if the initial energy @xmath193 is close to zero . using the relation @xmath190 , figure [ fig : peje ]",
    "also shows that at high energies the capture is very rare .",
    "a transition occurs at an intermediate energy as shown in figure [ fig : peje ] . for @xmath227 prograde orbits , the capture probability sharply drops from @xmath222 around @xmath228",
    "the critical value of @xmath217 at which the capture probability of a binary member @xmath69 drops from @xmath229 is given by @xmath230 this estimate well explains the critical velocities in figure [ fig : triton ] .",
    "if triton has a heavier companion and/or a member of a harder binary , the critical velocity could be higher , provided the binary is disrupted by neptune : @xmath231 .",
    "the semi - major axis of the captured member @xmath69 is @xmath232 where @xmath233 is about @xmath234 . after capture ,",
    "the orbit of triton needs to shrink to the current observed @xmath235 and @xmath236 either through tides or other means ( correia 2009 ; nogueira et al .",
    "the critical velocity and the semi - major axis for the secondary @xmath237 are obtained by exchanging the subscript 1 and 2 in eqs ( [ vcritical ] ) and ( [ tritonra ] ) .",
    "although a detailed modeling of the solar system is beyond the scope of this paper , the sun can not be generally ignored in the capture process ( e.g. philpott et al .",
    "2010 gaspar et al . 2011 ) .",
    "since the tidal radius @xmath238 is much smaller than the radius of neptune s hill sphere @xmath239 , neptune completely dominates the attraction of a binary during the tidal encounter .",
    "tidal effects from the sun are negligible for the disruption process itself , which is the main focus of the paper .",
    "however , the permanent capture of triton requires an additional condition that after the tidal breakup a capture orbit should be well inside the hill sphere .",
    "detailed numerical simulations show that retrograde satellites ( those orbiting in the opposite sense as neptune orbits the sun ) of neptune are more stable than prograde ones , and they are stable to distance of @xmath240 ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2003 ; holman et al .",
    "capture orbits are more eccentric than assumed in the numerical simulations , the stability region might be slightly smaller . considering that the apocenter distance is about twice the semi - major axis ( [ tritonra ] ) for highly eccentric orbits ,",
    "the binary which had included triton as a member should satisfy a relation , @xmath241 where we have used @xmath242 .",
    "a smaller value of the ratio @xmath243 gives a smaller apocenter distance and a higher critical velocity ( [ vcritical ] ) .",
    "as shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : d - dep ] ( the black solid and dashed lines ) , the phase - averaged value @xmath167 is slightly larger than unity for prograde binaries , and slightly smaller for retrograde binaries when the disruption probability is high . for a given encounter velocity ,",
    "a retrograde orbit of the binary center of mass around neptune with a prograde binary rotation is optimal to produce a stable capture orbit .",
    "the ellipticity @xmath244 of neptune induces a small deviation in its own gravitational potential from the point - mass estimate especially in a non - planar configuration .",
    "however , the deviation in the attraction force @xmath245 and the tidal acceleration @xmath246 is of order of @xmath247 at the tidal radius .",
    "the effect is clearly negligible .",
    "we have discussed how the members of a binary are ejected or captured after a tidal encounter with a massive object . we have shown that the ejection and capture dynamics can be well understood in the framework of the restricted three - body approximation .",
    "when the three - body exchange reaction happens , the orbit of the center of mass of the binary should be almost parabolic @xmath248 or equivalently the semi - major axis is large @xmath249 . the essential quantity to characterize the disruption process is the energy change @xmath48 at the encounter , which practically depends only on three parameters : the penetration factor @xmath250 , the binary rotation direction , and the binary phase @xmath149 . except for the phase shift of @xmath52 ,",
    "the energy change is exactly the same for the two members with arbitrary mass ratio .    in principle , for any positive ( negative ) orbital energy @xmath43 of the center of mass of a binary , the heavier member has more chance to be ejected ( captured ) , because it carries a larger fraction of the orbital energy .",
    "however , if the orbital energy is close to zero , the difference between their ejection ( capture ) probabilities becomes small , and there is practically no ejection and capture preference . for a parabolic orbit",
    ", each member is ejected in exactly @xmath53 of the cases .",
    "the preference becomes significant when the absolute value of the energy @xmath251 is comparable to the typical energy change @xmath55 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath251 is much larger than the typical energy change , they are both ejected for @xmath252 or captured for @xmath253 , and there is no ejection or capture preference .    corresponding to the typical energy change , we can define a critical encounter velocity @xmath254 for the capture process where the critical initial energy @xmath255 mainly depends on the penetration factor and the orientation of the binary . since the distribution of the energy change is the same for the two members , the secondary star has a higher critical velocity",
    ". the tidal encounter might be responsible for the capture of not only triton but also other irregular satellites in the solar system ( morbidelli 2006 , but see also vokrouhlick et al .",
    "2008 ; philpott et al .",
    "the stability of capture orbits for the solar perturbations also should be taken into account ) . however , the other irregular satellites are much lighter than triton .",
    "the capture mechanism @xmath256 requires that these irregular satellites have been in a binary with a very massive partner and that the less massive member has been predominantly captured .",
    "if a binary has a large orbital energy @xmath257 , the disruption would happen slightly inside the usual tidal radius at which the bh tidal forces become comparable to the binary mutual gravity forces .",
    "the abrupt disruption approximation provides a good estimate of the energy change , and the typical energy change in the high energy regime is much larger than in the low energy regime .",
    "however , the change is not significant compared to the initial energy @xmath43 , the tidal encounter is not an efficient acceleration process anymore . in the high energy regime , both members are ejected after the bh encounter .    in recent years",
    ", observations have identified a remarkable number of hypervelocity stars ( brown et al .",
    "2009 ; tillich et al .",
    "the distribution of line - of - sight velocities of hypervelocity star candidates shows a long tail in the high velocity region ( @xmath258 km / s ) which includes comparable numbers of unbound and bound stars assuming that the escape velocity of the galaxy at 50kpc is @xmath259 km / s ( brown et al .",
    "2009 ; kenyon et al .",
    "since the initial orbital energy is negligible when the three - body exchange reaction happens , the velocity distribution should reflect the distribution of the energy change @xmath120 at the tidal encounter ( and the galactic potential ) with its dependence on the periapsis distance , the binary orientation and phase .",
    "binaries are supplied to the bh at the galactic center predominantly from its radius of influence @xmath260 a few pc or even beyond it ( e.g. perets et al .",
    "2007 ; another interesting possibility is that they might arise from the nuclear stellar disk .",
    "e.g. madigan et al .",
    "those that come from about the radius of influence are on elliptical orbits .",
    "since the radius of influence is much larger than the tidal radius , the preferential ejection for high and low mass members @xmath261 is therefore irrelevant for stellar binaries ( @xmath262 ) if the binary semi - major axis is smaller than @xmath2631au .",
    "however , stars with planets ( @xmath264 ) of semi - major axis of 1au will predominantly eject the planets .",
