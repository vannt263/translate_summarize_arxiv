    "one of the best motivated extensions of the sm is a neutral gauge sector with an extra @xmath0 symmetry in addition to the sm hypercharge @xmath6 and an associated @xmath1 gauge boson , predicted in most grand unified theories ( guts ) such as @xmath7 or @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "there is an extensive range of models with such an additional @xmath0 symmetry ( for reviews , see  @xcite and references therein ) . among these",
    ", models based on the @xmath8 gut group and left - right symmetry groups have been extensively pursued in the literature and are particularly significant from the point of view of lhc phenomenology .",
    "here we summarize the analysis done in  @xcite of various @xmath1 models , which include @xmath8 based @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11  @xcite , @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite bosons , a @xmath14 boson appearing in models with left - right symmetry ( reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a sequential @xmath15 boson and a family non - universal @xmath16 boson  @xcite .",
    "the mixing between the mass eigenstates of @xmath1 and the @xmath17 is given by , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of @xmath17 boson in the absence of @xmath3 mixing and is given as @xmath20    we set @xmath21 here , which corresponds to a higgs sector with only @xmath22 doublets and singlets .",
    "furthermore , if the @xmath23 charge assignments of the higgs fields , @xmath24 , are known in a specific model , then there exists an additional constraint  @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and where @xmath27 is the @xmath28 gauge coupling .",
    "the latter is given in terms of @xmath29 whose value is conventionally set to 1 here .",
    "@xmath30 is a function of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the higgs fields and the @xmath24 , @xmath31 for @xmath8 based models one may restrict oneself to the case where the higgs fields arise from a * 27 * representation .",
    "the @xmath23 quantum numbers are then predicted and eq .",
    "[ parac ] receives contributions from the vevs of three higgs doublets , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , in correspondence with the standard lepton doublet , as well as the two doublets contained in the @xmath35 of @xmath36 .",
    "they satisfy the sum rule , @xmath37 , and we introduce the ratios , @xmath38 resulting in different expressions and ranges for @xmath30 in different models  @xcite .",
    "we used the special purpose fortran package gapp  @xcite dedicated to the global analysis of particle properties , wherein the effects of the @xmath1 bosons are taken into account as first order perturbations to the sm expressions .",
    "the most stringent indirect constraints on @xmath2 come from low - energy weak neutral current ( wnc ) experiments , while the size of the mixing angle @xmath4 is strongly constrained by the very high precision @xmath17-pole experiments at lep and slc . for details on the data , input parameters and analysis ,",
