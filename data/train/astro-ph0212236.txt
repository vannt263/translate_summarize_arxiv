    "in the past decade , our ability to routinely identify and systematically study distant galaxies has dramatically advanced our knowledge of the high - redshift universe .",
    "in particular , the efficient u - dropout technique @xcite has enabled the selection of distant galaxies from optical imaging surveys using simple photometric criteria .",
    "now more than 1000 of these lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath13 , and have been subject to targeted studies on spatial clustering @xcite , internal kinematics @xcite , dust properties @xcite , and stellar composition @xcite . although lbgs are among the best studied classes of distant galaxies to date , many of their properties like their prior star formation history , stellar population ages , and masses are not well known .",
    "more importantly , it is unclear if the ultraviolet - optical selection technique alone will give us a fair census of the galaxy population at @xmath14 as it requires galaxies to have high far - ultraviolet surface brightnesses due to on - going spatially compact and relatively unobscured massive star formation .",
    "we know that there exist highly obscured galaxies , detected in sub - mm and radio surveys @xcite , and optically faint hard x - ray sources @xcite at high redshift that would not be selected as lbgs , but their number densities are low compared to lbgs and they might represent rare populations or transient evolutionary phases . in addition , the majority of present - day elliptical and spiral galaxies , when placed at @xmath14 , would not satisfy any of the current selection techniques for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "specifically , they would not be selected as u - dropout galaxies because they are too faint in the rest - frame uv .",
    "it is much easier to detect such galaxies in the near - infrared ( nir ) , where one can access their rest - frame optical light .",
    "furthermore , observations in the near - infrared allow the comparison of galaxies of different epochs at fixed rest - frame wavelengths where long - lived stars may dominate the integrated light .",
    "compared to the rest - frame far - uv , the rest - frame optical light is less sensitive to the effects of dust extinction and on - going star formation , and provides a better tracer of stellar mass . by selecting galaxies in the near - infrared @xmath2-band , we expect to obtain a more complete census of the galaxies that dominate the stellar mass density in the high - redshift universe , thus tracing the build - up of stellar mass directly .",
    "in this context we initiated the faint infrared extragalactic survey  ( fires ; * ? ? ? * ) , a large public program carried out at the _ very large telescope _ ( vlt ) consisting of very deep nir imaging of two selected fields .",
    "we observed fields with existing deep optical wfpc2 imaging from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) : the wpfc2-field of hubble deep field south  ( hdf - s ) , and the field around the @xmath15 cluster ms1054 - 03 .",
    "the addition of nir data to the optical photometry is required not only to access the rest - frame optical , but also to determine the redshifts of faint galaxies from their broadband photometry alone .",
    "while it may be possible to go to even redder wavelengths from the ground , the gain in terms of effective wavelength leverage is less dramatic compared to the threefold increase going from the @xmath16 to @xmath17-band .",
    "this is because the @xmath2-band is currently the reddest band where achievable sensitivity and resolution are reasonably comparable to deep space - based optical data . preliminary results from this program were presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter r01 ) .    here",
    "we present the full nir data set of the hdf - s , together with a @xmath2-selected multicolor catalog of sources in the hdf - s  with seven - band optical - to - infrared photometry ( covering @xmath18 ) , unique in its image quality and depth .",
    "this paper focusses on the observations , data reduction and characteristic properties of the final images .",
    "we also describe the source detection and photometric measurement procedures and lay out the contents of the catalog , concluding with the nir number counts , color distributions of sources , and their photometric redshifts .",
    "the results of the ms1054 - 03 field will be presented by @xcite and a more detailed explanation of the photometric redshift technique can be found in @xcite . throughout this paper ,",
    "all magnitudes are expressed in the ab photometric system @xcite unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the high galactic latitude field of the hdf - s  is a natural choice for follow - up in the near - infrared given the existing ultradeep wfpc2 data in four optical filters @xcite .",
    "the hubble deep fields ( north and south ) are specifically aimed at constraining cosmology and galaxy evolution models , and in these studies it is crucial to access rest - frame optical wavelengths at high redshift through deep infrared observations .",
    "available ground - based nir data from sofi on the ntt @xcite are not deep enough to match the space - based data . to fully take advantage of the deep optical data",
    "requires extremely deep wide - field imaging in the infrared at the best possible image quality ; a combination that in the southern hemisphere can only be delivered by the infrared spectrometer and array camera  ( isaac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mounted on the nasmyth - b focus of the 8.2 meter vlt antu telescope .",
    "the infrared camera has a @xmath19 field of view similar to that of the wfpc2 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "isaac is equipped with a rockwell hawaii @xmath21 hgcdte array , offering imaging with a pixel scale of @xmath22 pix@xmath23 in various broad and narrow band filters .",
    "our nir imaging consists of a single isaac pointing centered on the wfpc2 main - field of the hdf - s  ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , j2000 ) in the @xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath2  filters , which gives good sampling of rest - frame optical wavelengths over the redshift range @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath0filter is being established as the new standard broadband filter at @xmath27 by most major observatories ( keck , gemini , subaru , eso ) , and is photometrically more accurate than the classical @xmath28 because it is not cut off by atmospheric absorption .",
    "it is a top - hat filter with sharp edges , practically the same effective wavelength as the normal @xmath28 filter , and half - transmittance points at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we used the @xmath2  filter which is bluer and narrower than standard @xmath17 , but gives a better signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for faint sources because it is less affected by the high thermal background of the atmosphere and the telescope . the isaac @xmath1  and @xmath2  filters are close to those used to establish the faint ir standard star system @xcite , while the @xmath0  filter requires a small color correction .",
    "the wfpc2 filters that are used are @xmath31 and @xmath32 which we will call @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35  and @xmath36 , respectively , where the subscript indicates the central wavelength in nanometers .    the observing strategy for the hdf - s  follows established procedures for ground - based nir imaging .",
    "the dominance of the sky background and its rapid variability in the infrared requires dithering of many short exposures .",
    "we used a @xmath37 jitter box in which the telescope is moved in a random pattern of poissonian offsets between successive exposures .",
    "this jitter size is a trade - off between keeping a large area at maximum depth and ensuring that each pixel has sufficient exposures on sky .",
    "individual exposures have integration times of @xmath38s in @xmath0 , @xmath39s in @xmath1 , and @xmath40s in @xmath2  ( subintegrations @xmath41 detector integration times ) .",
    "we requested service mode observations amounting to 32 hours in each band with a seeing requirement of @xmath42 , seeing conditions that are only available 25% of the time at paranal .",
    "the observations were grouped in @xmath43 observation blocks ( obs ) , each of which uniquely defines a single observation of a target , including pointing , number of exposures in a sequence , and filter .",
    "the calibration plan for isaac provides the necessary calibration measurements for such blocks , including twilight flats , detector darks , and nightly zero points by observing lco / palomar nicmos standard stars @xcite .",
    "the hdf - s  was observed from october to december 1999 and from april to october 2000 under eso program identification 164.o-0612(a ) .",
    "a summary of the observations is shown in [ table.hdfs.summary ] .",
    "we obtained a total of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 hours in @xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath2 , distributed over @xmath47 and @xmath48 obs , or @xmath49 and @xmath50 frames , respectively .",
    "this represents all usable data , including aborted and re - executed obs that were outside weather specifications or seeing constraints . in the reduction process",
    "these data are included with appropriate weighting ( see section [ reduction.additional ] ) .",
    "sixty - eight percent of the data was obtained under photometric conditions and the average airmass of all data was 1.25 .",
    "a detailed summary of observational parameters with pointing , observation date , image quality and photometric conditions can be found on the fires   homepage on the world wide web ( http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~{}fires[http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~\\{}fires ] ) .",
    "an analysis of various observational parameters reveals some surprising trends in the data , whereas other expected relations are less apparent .",
    "an overview is given in figure [ fig.obs ] .",
    "the median seeing on the raw images is better than 05 in all bands , with the seeing of 90% of the images in the range @xmath51 , as can be seen in figure [ fig.obs ] .",
    "seeing may vary strongly on short timescales but it is not related to any other parameter . the most drastic trend in the raw data",
    "is the change of sensitivity with date . since the cleaning and re - alumization of the primary mirror in march 2000 the count rates of bright stars within a @xmath52 aperture increased by @xmath53% in @xmath0 , @xmath54% in @xmath1 , and @xmath54% @xmath2 , which is reflected by a change in zero points before and after this date . because the average nir sky levels remained the same , this increase proportionally improved the achievable signal - to - noise for background - limited sources .",
    "the change in throughput was caused by light scattering , which explains why the sky level remained constant .",
    "sky levels in @xmath0  and @xmath1 , dominated by airglow from oh - emission lines in the upper atmosphere ( typically 90 km altitude ) , vary unpredictably on the timescale of minutes , but also systematically with observed hour .",
    "the average sky level is highest at the beginning and end of each night with peak - to - peak amplitudes of the variation being 50% relative to the average sky brightnesses over the night .",
    "the background in @xmath2 is dominated by thermal emission of the telescope , instrument , and atmosphere and is mainly a function of temperature .",
    "the @xmath2 background is the most stable of all nir bands and only weakly correlated with airmass ; our data do not show a strong thermal atmospheric contribution , which should be proportional to atmospheric path length .",
    "we take into account the variations of the background and seeing through weighting in the data coadding process .",
    "the reduction process included the following steps : quality verification , flat - fielding , bad pixel correction , sky subtraction , distortion correction , registration , photometric calibration and weighting of individual frames , and combination into a single frame .",
    "we used a modified version of the dimsum package and standard routines in iraf for sky subtraction and coadding , and the eclipse package for creating the flatfields and the initial bad pixel masks .",
    "we reduced the isaac observations several times with an increasing level of sophistication , applying corrections to remove instrumental features , scattered light , or clear artifacts when required . here",
    "we describe the first version of the reduction ( v1.0 ) and the last version ( v3.0 ) , leaving out the intermediate trial versions .",
    "the last version produced the final @xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath2  images , on which the photometry ( see section [ sourcedetection ] ) and analysis ( see section [ analysis ] ) is based .",
    "we constructed flatfields from images of the sky taken at dusk or dawn , grouped per night and in the relevant filters , using the * flat * routine in * eclipse * , which also provided the bad pixel maps .",
    "we excluded a few flats of poor quality and flats that exhibited a large jump between the top row of the lower and bottom row of the upper half of the array , possibly caused by the varying bias levels of the hawaii detector .",
    "we averaged the remaining nightly flats per month , and applied these to the individual frames of the obs taken in the same month . if no flatfield was available for a given month we used an average flat of all months .",
    "the stability of these monthly flats is very good and the structure changes little and in a gradual way .",
    "we estimate the relative accuracy to be @xmath55% per pixel from the pixel - to - pixel rms variation between different monthly flats .",
    "large scale gradients in the monthly flats do not exceed 2% .",
    "we checked that standard stars , which were observed at various locations on the detector , were consistent within the error after flatfielding .",
    "standard stars in the lco / palomar nicmos list @xcite were observed each night , in a wide five - point jitter pattern . for each star , on each night , and in each filter , we measured the instrumental counts in a circular aperture of radius @xmath56 pixel ( @xmath57 ) and derived zero points per night from the magnitude of that star in the nicmos list .",
    "we identify non - photometric nights after comparison with the median of the zero points over all nights before and after re - aluminization in march 2000 ( see section [ observations.observations ] ) . the photometric zero points exhibit a large increase after march 2000 but , apart from this , the night - to - night scatter is approximately 2% .",
    "we adopted the mean of the zero points after march 2000 as our reference value .",
    "see table [ table.zp.summary ] for the list of the adopted zero points . by applying the nightly zero points to 4 bright unsaturated stars in the hdf - s , observed on the same night under photometric conditions , we obtain calibrated stellar magnitudes with a night - to - night rms variation of only @xmath58% .",
    "no corrections for atmospheric absorption were required because the majority of the science data were obtained at similar airmass as the standard star observations .",
    "in addition , instrumental count rates of hdf - s stars in individual observation blocks reveal no correlation with airmass .",
    "we used the calibrated magnitudes of the 4 reference stars , averaged over all photometric nights , to calibrate every individual exposure of the photometric and non - photometric obs .",
    "the detector non - linearity , as described by @xcite , affects the photometric calibration by @xmath59% in the @xmath1-band , where the exposure levels are highest .",
    "because the effect is so small , we do not correct for this .",
    "we did not account for color terms due to differences between the isaac and standard filter systems .",
    "@xcite report that the isaac @xmath1  and @xmath2  filters match very well those used to establish the faint ir standard star system of @xcite . only the isaac @xmath0filter is slightly redder than persson s @xmath28 and",
    "this may introduce a small color term , @xmath60 .",
    "however , the theoretical transformation between isaac magnitudes and those of lco / palomar have never been experimentally verified .",
    "furthermore , the predicted color correction is small and could not be reproduced with our data . in the absence of a better calibration we chose not to apply any color correction",
    "we did apply galactic extinction correction when deriving the photometric redshifts , see section [ phot.intro ] , but it is not applied to the catalog .    as a photometric sanity check",
    ", we compared @xmath61 circular diameter aperture magnitudes of the brightest stars in the final ( version 3.0 , described below ) images to magnitudes based on a small fraction of the data presented by r01 .",
    "each data set was independently reduced , the calibration based on different standard stars , and the shallower data were obtained before re - aluminization of the primary mirror .",
    "the magnitudes of the brightest sources in all bands agree within 1% between the versions , indicating that the internal photometric systematics are well under control . for the nir data , the adopted transformations from the @xcite system to the ab system",
    "are taken from @xcite and we apply @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the rapidly varying sky , typically 25 thousand times brighter than the sources we aim to detect , is the primary limiting factor in deep nir imaging . in the longest integrations , small errors in sky subtraction",
    "can severely diminish the achievable depth and affect faint source photometry .",
    "the iraf package dimsum provides a two - pass routine to optimally separate sky and astronomical signal in the dithered images .",
    "we modified it to enable handling of large amounts of data and replaced its co - adding subroutine , which assumes that the images are undersampled , by the standard iraf task images.immatch.imcombine .",
    "the following is a brief summary of the steps performed by the reduce task in dimsum .    for every science image in a given ob a sky image",
    "is constructed . after scaling the exposures to a common median",
    ", the sky is determined at each pixel position from a maximum of 8 and a minimum of 3 adjacent frames in time .",
    "the lowest and highest values are rejected and the average of the remainder is taken as the sky value .",
    "these values are subtracted from the scaled image to create a sky subtracted image .",
    "a set of stars is then used to compute relative shifts , and the images are integer registered and averaged to produce an intermediate image .",
    "all astronomical sources are identified and a corresponding object mask is created .",
    "this mask is used in a second pass of sky subtraction where pixels covered by objects are excluded from the estimate of the sky .",
    "the images show low - level pattern due to bias variations . because they generally reproduce",
    "they are automatically removed in the skysubtraction step .",
    "we find cosmic rays with dimsum , using a simple threshold algorithm and replacing them by the local median , unless a pixel is found to have cosmic rays in more than frames per ob . in this case",
    "the pixel is added to the bad pixel map for that ob .",
    "the goal of the first reduction of the data set is to provide a non - optimized image , which we use to validate and to assess the improvements from more sophisticated image processing .",
    "the first version consists of registration on integer pixels and combination of the sky subtracted exposures per ob . for each of the @xmath64 obs",
    ", we created an average and a median combined image to verify that cosmic rays and other outliers were removed correctly , and we visually inspected all @xmath65 individual sky subtracted frames as well , finding that many required further processing as described in the following section .",
    "finally , we generated the version 1.0 images ( the first reduction of the full data set ) by integer pixel shifting all obs to a common reference frame , and coaveraging them into the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 images . while this first reduction is not optimal in terms of depth and image quality , it is robust owing to its straightforward reduction procedure .",
    "the individual sky subtracted frames are affected by a number of problems or instrumental features , which we briefly describe below , together with the applied solutions and additional improvements that lead to the version 3.0 images .",
    "the most important problems are :    * detector bias residuals , most pronounced at the rows where the read - out of the detector starts at the bottom ( rows @xmath66 ) and halfway ( rows @xmath67 ) , caused by the complex bias behaviour of the rockwell hawaii array . these variations are uniform along rows , and we removed the residual bias by subtracting the median along rows in individual sky subtracted exposures , after masking all sources . * imperfect sky subtraction , caused by stray light or rapid background variations . strong variations in the backgrounds , reflection from high cirrus , reflected moonlight in the isaac optics or patterns of less obvious origin can lead to large scale residuals in the sky subtraction , particularly in @xmath0  and @xmath1 . for some obs",
    ", we succesfully removed the residual patterns by splitting the sequence in two ( in case of a sudden appearance of stray light ) , or subtracting a two - piece cubic spline fit along rows and columns to the background in individual frames , after masking all sources .",
    "we rejected a few frames , or masked the affected areas , if this simple solution did not work . * unidentified cosmic rays or bad pixels .",
    "a small amount of bad pixels were not detected by eclipse or dimsum routines but need to be identified because we average the final images without additional clipping or rejection . by combining the sky subtracted frames in a given ob without shifts and with the sources masked , we identified remaining cosmic rays or outliers through sigma clipping .",
    "we added @xmath68 pixels per ob to the corresponding bad pixel map .",
    "several steps were taken to improve the quality and limiting depths of the version 1.0 images , the most important of which are :    * distortion correction of the individual frames and direct registration to the @xmath69 blocked @xmath36  image ( @xmath70pixel@xmath23 ) , our preferred frame of reference .",
    "we obtained the geometrical distortion coefficients for the 3rd order polynomial solution from the isaac www - page ] .",
    "the transformation procedure involves distortion correcting the isaac images , adjusting the frame - to - frame shifts , and finding the linear transformation to the wfpc2 @xmath36  frame of reference .",
    "this linear transformation is the best fit mapping of source positions in the blocked wfpc2 @xmath36  image to the corresponding positions in the corrected @xmath0-band image .",
    "compared to version 1.0 described in the previous section , this procedure increases registration accuracy and image quality , decreases image smearing at the edges introduced by the jittering and differential distortion .",
    "given the small amplitude of the isaac field distortions , the effect on photometry is negligible . in the linear transformation and distortion correction step",
    "the image is resampled once using a third - order polynomial interpolation , with a minimal effect of the interpolant on the noise properties .",
    "* weighting of the images .",
    "we substantially improved the final image depth and quality by assigning weights to individual frames that take into account changes in seeing , sky transparency , and background noise .",
    "two schemes were applied : one that optimizes the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) within an aperture of the size of the seeing disk , and one that optimizes the snr per pixel . the first improves the detection efficiency of point sources , the other optimizes the surface brightness photometry .",
    "the weights @xmath71 of the frames are proportional to either the inverse scaled variance @xmath72 within a seeing disk of size @xmath73 , or to the inverse scaled variance per pixel , where the scaling @xmath74 is the flux calibration applied to bring the instrumental counts of our four reference stars in the hdf - s to the calibrated magnitude .",
    "+ @xmath75 + @xmath76      the final combined @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2  images ( version 3.0 ) were constructed from the individually registered , distortion corrected , weighted and unclipped average of the @xmath77 , and @xmath50 nir frames respectively .",
    "ultimately , less than 3% of individual frames were excluded in the final images because of poor quality . in this step",
    "we also generated the weight maps , which contain the weighted exposure time per pixel .",
    "we produced three versions of the images , one with optimized weights for point sources , one with optimized weights for surface brightness , and one consisting of the best quartile seeing fraction of all exposures , also optimized for point sources .",
    "the weighting has improved the image quality by 1015% and the background noise by 510% , and distortion correction resulted in subpixel registration accuracy between the nir images and @xmath36-band image over the entire field of view .",
    "the sky subtraction routine in dimsum and our additional fitting of rows and columns ( see section [ reduction.additional ] ) have introduced small negative biases in combined images , caused by systematic oversubtraction of the sky which was skewed by light of the faint extended psf wings or very faint sources , undetectable in a single ob . because of this , the flatness of the sky on large scales was limited to about 10@xmath78 .",
    "the negative bias was visible as clearly defined orthogonal stripes at p.a.@xmath79 , as well as dark areas around the brightest stars or in the crowded parts of the images .",
    "to solve this , we rotated a copy of the final images back to the orientation in which we performed sky substraction , fitted a 3-piece cubic spline to the background along rows and columns ( masking all sources ) , re - rotated the fit , and subtracted it .",
    "the sky in the final images is flat to a few @xmath80 on large ( @xmath81 ) scales .",
    "the reduced nir @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2  images and weight maps can be obtained from the fires - www homepage ( http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~{}fires[http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~\\{}fires ] ) . throughout the rest of the paper we will only consider the images optimized for point source detection which we will use to assemble the catalog of sources .",
    "the pixel size in the nir images equals that of the @xmath69 blocked wfpc2 @xmath36-band image at @xmath70 pixel@xmath23 .",
    "the combined isaac images are aligned with the hst version 2 images @xcite with north up , and are normalized to instrumental counts per second .",
    "the images are shallower near the edges of the covered area because they received less exposure time in the dithering process , which is reflected in the weight map containing the fraction of total exposure time per pixel .",
    "the area of the isaac @xmath2-band image with weight per pixel @xmath82 and @xmath83 covers @xmath84 and @xmath85 arcmin@xmath86 , while the area used for our preferred quality cut for photometry ( @xmath87 in all seven bands ) is @xmath88 arcmin@xmath86 .",
    "the nir images have been trimmed where the relative exposure time per pixel is less than 1% .",
    "figure  [ images.kdet ] shows the noise - equalized @xmath2-detection image obtained by division with the square root of the exposure - time map .",
    "the richness in faint compact sources and the flatness of the background are readily visible .",
    "figure  [ images.ijk ] shows a rgb color composite image of the @xmath36 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2  images .",
    "the psf of the space - based @xmath36  image has been matched to that of the nir images at fwhm@xmath7 ( see section [ images.quality ] ) and three adjacent wfpc2 @xmath36  flanking fields have been included for visual purposes .",
    "we set the linear stretch of both images to favor faint objects .",
    "immediately striking is the rich variety in optical - nir colors , even for the faint objects , indicating that the nir observations are very deep and that there is a wide range of observed spectral shapes , which can result from different types of galaxies over a broad redshift range .",
    "the nir psf is stable and symmetric over the field with a gaussian core profile and an average ellipticity @xmath89 over the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2  images .",
    "the median fwhm of the profiles of ten selected isolated bright stars is @xmath90 in @xmath0 , @xmath91 @xmath1 , and @xmath92 @xmath2 with @xmath93 amplitude variation over the images .    for consistent photometry in all bands we convolved the measurement images to a common psf , corresponding to that of the @xmath1-band which had worst effective seeing ( fwhm @xmath94 ) .",
    "the similarity of psf structure across the nir images allowed simple gaussian smoothing for a near perfect match .",
    "the complex psf structure of the wfpc2 requires convolving with a special kernel , which we constructed by deconvolving an average image of bright isolated non - saturated stars in the @xmath1-band with the average @xmath36-band image of the same stars .",
    "division of the stellar growth curves of the convolved images by the @xmath1-band growth curve shows that the fractional enclosed flux agrees to within 3% at radii @xmath95 .",
    "[ t ]          the relative registration between isaac and wfpc2 images needs to be very precise , preferably a fraction of an original isaac pixel over the whole field of view , to allow correct cross - identification of sources , accurate color information and morphological comparison between different bands .",
    "to verify our mapping of isaac to wfpc2 coordinates , we measured the positions of the 20 brightest stars and compact sources in all registered isaac exposures , and we compared their positions with those in the @xmath36  image .",
    "the rms variation in position of individual sources is about @xmath96 pixel at @xmath70 pixel@xmath23 ( @xmath97 mas ) , but for some sources systematic offsets between the nir and the optical up to @xmath98 pixel ( @xmath99 mas ) remain .",
    "the origin of the residuals is unclear and we can not fit them with low order polynomials .",
    "they could be real , intrinsic to the sources , or due to systematic errors in the field distortion correction of isaac or wfpc2 @xcite , but is expected to be smaller for the hdf - s images . ] .",
    "however , for all our purposes , the effect of positional errors of this amplitude is unimportant .",
    "the error in absolute astrometry of the hst hdf - s  coordinate system , estimated to be less than @xmath100 mas , is dominated by the systematic uncertainty in the positions of four reference stars @xcite .",
    "the noise properties of the raw individual isaac images are well described by the variance of the signal collected in each pixel since both poisson and read noise are uncorrelated .",
    "however , image processing , registration and combination have introduced correlations between neighbouring pixels and small errors in the background subtraction may also contribute to the noise .",
    "understanding the noise properties well is crucial because limiting depths and photometric uncertainties rely on them .    instead of a formal description based on the analysis of the covariance of correlated pixel pairs , we followed an empirical approach where we fit the dependence of the rms background variation in the image as a function of linear size @xmath101 of apertures with area @xmath102 . directly measuring the effective flux variations in apertures of different sizes",
    "provides a more realistic estimate of signal variations than formal gaussian scaling @xmath103 of the pixel - to - pixel noise @xmath104 , as is often done .",
    "we measured fluxes in @xmath105 non - overlapping circular apertures randomly placed on the registered convolved images , which were also used for photometry .",
    "we excluded all pixels belonging to sources detectable in @xmath2  at the 5@xmath106 level ( see section [ detection ] for detection criteria ) .",
    "we used identical aperture positions for each band @xmath107 and measured fluxes for circular aperture diameters ranging from @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "then we obtained the flux dispersions by fitting a gaussian distribution to the histogram of fluxes at each aperture size .",
    "finally , we fitted a parameterized function of linear size to the different dispersions :    @xmath110",
    "this equation describes the signal variation versus aperture size @xmath111 over the entire image , taking into account spatial variations as a result of relative weight @xmath71 for each passband @xmath107 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig.errors ]",
    ", it provides a good fit to the noise characteristics .",
    "the noise is significantly higher than expected from uncorrelated ( gaussian ) noise , indicated by a dashed line in figure  [ fig.errors]b .",
    "table[table.background ] shows the best fit values in all bands and the corresponding limiting depths .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 reflects the correlations of neighbouring pixels ( @xmath113 ) , which is important in the wfpc2 images because of heavy smoothing , but also in the isaac images given the resampling from @xmath22 to @xmath114 pixel@xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath115 accounts for large scale correlated variations in the background ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "this may be caused by the presence of sources at very faint flux levels ( confusion noise ) or instrumental features .",
    "typically , the large scale correlated contribution per pixel is only 3 - 15% relative to the gaussian rms variation , but due to the @xmath117 proportionality the contribution to the variation in large apertures increases to significant levels .",
    "while the signal variations grow faster with area than expected from a gaussian , at any specific scale the variation is consistent with a pure gaussian .    from the analysis of the scaling relation of simulated colors we find that part of the large scale irregularities in the background",
    "are spatially correlated between bands . in particular , we measured the rms variation of the @xmath118  colors directly by subtracting in registered apertures the @xmath36-band fluxes from the @xmath35  fluxes and fitting the dispersion of the difference at each linear size . on large scales",
    "rms variations are 30% smaller than predicted from eq . 3 if the noise were uncorrelated .",
    "yet , if we subtract the two fluxes in random apertures , the scaling of the background variation is consistent with the prediction .",
    "a similar effect is seen for the @xmath119 color , but at a smaller amplitude .",
    "the spatial coherence of the background variations between filters and across cameras suggests that part of the background fluctuations may be associated with sources at very faint flux levels .",
    "other contributions are likely similar flatfielding or skysubtraction residuals from one band to another .",
    "the detection of sources at very faint magnitudes against a noisy background forces us to trade off completeness and reliability .",
    "a very low detection threshold may generate the most complete catalog , but we must then apply additional criteria to assess the reliability of each detection given that such a catalog will contain many spurious sources .",
    "more conservatively , we choose the lowest possible threshold for which contamination by noise is unimportant .",
    "we aim to produce a catalog with reliable colors suitable for robustly modeling of the intrinsic spectral energy distribution . using sextractor version 2.2.2 @xcite with a detection procedure that optimizes sensitivity for point - like sources ,",
    "we construct a @xmath2-band selected catalog with seven band optical - to - infrared photometry .",
    "to detect objects with sextractor using a constant signal - to - noise criterion over the entire image , including the shallower outer parts , we divide the point source optimized @xmath2-image by the square root of the weight ( exposure time ) map to create a noise - equalized detection image .",
    "a source enters the catalog if , after low - pass filtering of the detection image , at least one pixel is above @xmath120 times the standard deviation of the filtered background , corresponding to a total @xmath2-band magnitude limit for point sources of @xmath121 .",
    "this depth is reached for the central @xmath122 arcmin@xmath86 . in total",
    "we have 833 detections in the entire survey area of @xmath85 arcmin@xmath86 .",
    "initially 820 sources are found but the detection software fails to detect sources lying in the extended wings of the brightest objects . to include these , we fit the surface brightness profiles of the brightest sources with the galphot package @xcite in iraf , subtract the fit , and carry out a second detection pass with identical parameters .",
    "thirteen new objects enter the catalog , and 9 sources detected in the first pass are replaced with improved photometry .",
    "the catalog identification numbers of all second - pass objects start at 10001 , and the original entries of the updated sources are removed .",
    "filtering affects only the detection process and the isophotal parameters ; other output parameters are affected only indirectly through barycenter and object extent .",
    "we chose a simple two - dimensional gaussian detection filter ( fwhm@xmath123 ) , approximating the core of the effective @xmath2-band psf well .",
    "hence , we optimize detectability for point - like sources , introducing a small bias against faint extended objects . in principle",
    "it is possible to combine multiple catalogs created with different filter sizes but merging these catalogs consistently is a complicated and subjective process yielding a modest gain only in sensitivity for larger objects .",
    "we prefer the small filter size equal to the psf in the detection map because the majority of faint sources that we detect are compact or unresolved in the nir and because we wish to minimize the blending effect of filtering on the isophotal parameters and on the confusion of sources .",
    "sextractor applies a _ multi - thresholding _ technique to separate overlapping sources based on the distribution of the filtered @xmath2-band light . about 20% of the sources",
    "are blended because of the low value of the isophotal threshold ; in sextractor this must always equal the detection threshold . with the deblending parameters we used , the algorithm succeeds in splitting close groups of separate galaxies , without `` oversplitting '' galaxies with rich internal structure .",
    "we tested sensitivity to false detections by running sextractor on a specially constructed @xmath2-band noise map created by subtracting , in pairs , individual @xmath2-band images of comparable seeing , after zero point scaling , and coaveraging the weighted difference images .",
    "this noise image has properties very similar to the noise in the original reduced image , including contributions from the detector and reduction process , but with no trace of astronomical sources .",
    "our detection algorithm resulted in only 11 spurious sources over the full area .",
    "we use sextractor s dual - image mode for spatially accurate and consistent photometry , where objects are detected and isophotal parameters are determined from the @xmath2-band detection image while the fluxes in all seven bands are measured in the registered and psf matched images .",
    "we used fluxes measured in circular apertures @xmath124 with fixed - diameters @xmath125 , isophotal apertures @xmath126 determined by the @xmath2-band detection isophote at the @xmath127 detection threshold , and @xmath128 ( autoscaling ) apertures inspired by @xcite , which scales an elliptical aperture based on the first moments of the @xmath2-band light distribution .",
    "we select for each object the best aperture based on simple criteria to enable detailed control of photometry .",
    "we define two types of measurements :    * `` color '' flux , to obtain consistent and accurate colors . the optimal aperture is chosen based on the @xmath2 flux distribution , and this aperture",
    "is used to measure the flux in all other bands .",
    "* `` total '' flux , only in the @xmath2-band , which gives the best estimate of the total @xmath2 flux .",
    "for both measurements we treat blended sources differently from unblended ones , and consider a source blended when its blended _ or _ bias flag is set by sextractor , as described in @xcite .",
    "our color aperture is chosen as follows , introducing the equivalent of a circular isophotal diameter @xmath129 based on @xmath130 , the measured non - circular isophotal area within the detection - isophote :    @xmath131        the parameter @xmath132 is the factor with which we shrink the circular apertures centered on blended sources , increasing the separation to the blended neighbour such that mutual flux contamination is minimal .",
    "this factor depends on the data set , and for our isaac @xmath2 image we find that @xmath133 is most successful .",
    "the smallest aperture considered , aper(@xmath134 ) , @xmath135 fwhm of the effective psf , optimizes the s / n for photometry of point sources in unweighted apertures and prevents smaller more error - prone apertures .",
    "the largest allowed aperture , aper(@xmath136 ) , prevents large and inaccurate isophotal apertures driven by the filtered @xmath2-light distribution .",
    "we continuously assessed the robustness and quality of color flux measurements by inspecting the fits of redshifted galaxy templates to the flux points , as described in detail in @xmath137[phot.intro ] .",
    "we calculate the total flux in the @xmath2-band from the flux measured in the auto aperture . we define a circularized auto diameter @xmath138 with @xmath139 the area of the auto aperture , and define the total magnitude as :    @xmath140    finally",
    ", we apply an aperture correction using the growth curve of brighter stars to correct for the flux lost because it fell outside the `` total '' aperture .",
    "this aperture correction is necessary because it is substantial for our faintest sources , as shown in figure [ fig.apercor ] where we compare different methods to estimate magnitude .",
    "the aperture correction reaches 0.7 mag at the faint end , therefore magnitudes are seriously underestimated if the aperture correction is ignored .",
    "we derive the @xmath141 photometric error for all measurements from eq . [ error.scaling ] with the best - fit values shown in table [ table.background ] .",
    "these errors may overestimate the uncertainty in colors of adjacent bands ( see section [ images.background ] ) but it should represent well the photometric error over the entire @xmath142 wavelength range . the magnitudes may suffer from additional uncertainties because of surface brightness biases or possible biases in the sky subtraction procedure which could depend on object magnitude and size .",
    "to physically interpret the seven - band photometry for our @xmath2-band selected sample , we use a photometric redshift ( @xmath143 ) technique explained in detail by r01 . in summary , we correct the observed flux points for galactic extinction ( see @xcite ) and we model the rest - frame colors of the galaxies by fitting a linear combination of redshifted empirical galaxy templates .",
    "the redshift with the lowest @xmath144 statistic , where @xmath145 ^ 2\\ ] ] is then chosen as the most likely @xmath143 . using a linear combination of seds as @xmath146 minimizes the a priori assumptions about the nature and stellar composition of the detected sources .    our data set with three deep nir bands samples the position of balmer/4000  break over @xmath147 , allowing us to probe the redshift distribution of more evolved galaxy types that may have little rest - frame uv flux and hence a weak or virtually absent lyman break .",
    "we used the local hubble type templates e , sbc , scd , and i m from @xcite , the two starburst templates , sb1 and sb2 , with low derived reddening from @xcite , and a 10 myr old single age template model from @xcite .",
    "the starburst templates are needed because many galaxies even in the nearby universe have bluer colors than the bluest cww templates .",
    "the observed templates are extended beyond their published wavelengths into the far - ultraviolet by power law extrapolation and into the nir using stellar population synthesis models from @xcite , with the initial mass functions and star - formation timescales for each template hubble type from @xcite .",
    "we accounted for internal hydrogen absorption of each galaxy by setting the flux blueward of the @xmath148  lyman limit to zero , and for the redshift - dependent cosmic mean opacity due to neutral intergalactic hydrogen by following the prescriptions of @xcite .",
    "the best test of photometric redshifts is direct comparison to spectroscopic redshifts , but spectroscopic redshifts in the hdf - s are still scarce .",
    "we calculate the uncertainty in the photometric redshift due to the flux measurement errors using a monte - carlo ( mc ) technique derived from that used in r01 and fully explained in @xcite . at bright magnitudes template mismatch dominates the errors , something that is not modeled by the mc simulation .",
    "hence , the mc error bars for bright galaxies are severe underestimates . at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "the uncertainty is driven by errors in photometry @xcite and the mc technique should provide accurate @xmath143 uncertainties . experience from r01",
    "showed that two ways to correct for the template mismatch , setting a minimum fractional flux error or setting a minimum @xmath143 error based on the mean disagreement with @xmath150 , either degrade the accuracy of the @xmath143 measurement or reflect the systematic error only in the mean , while template mismatch can be a strong function of sed shape and redshift . a method based completely on monte - carlo techniques",
    "is preferable because it has a straightforwardly computable redshift probability function .",
    "this approach is desirable for estimating the rest - frame luminosities and colors @xcite .",
    "therefore , we modify the mc errors directly using the fires photometry . in summary",
    ", we estimate the systematic component of the @xmath143 uncertainty by scaling up all the photometric errors for a given galaxy with a constant to bring residuals of the fit in agreement with the errors .",
    "this will not change the best fit redshift and sed and will not modify the mc errorbars of faint objects , but it will enlarge the redshift interval over which the templates can satisfactorily fit the bright objects . only in case of widely different photometric errors between the visible and infrared might the modified mc uncertainties still underestimate the true @xmath143 uncertainty .    in figure [ fig.zphot_zspec ]",
    "we show a direct test of photometric redshifts of the 39 objects in the hdf - s with available spectroscopy and good photometry in all bands .",
    "the current set of spectroscopic redshifts in the hdf - s  will appear in @xcite .",
    "for the small sample that we can directly compare , we find excellent agreement with no failures and with a mean @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "it is encouraging to see that the modified 68% error bars that were derived from the monte carlo simulations are consistent with the measured disagreement between @xmath143 and the @xmath150 in the hdf - s .",
    "however , large asymmetric uncertainties remain for some objects , clearly showing the presence of a second photometric redshift solution of comparable likelihood at a vastly different redshift , revealing limits on the applicability of the photometric redshift technique .          in a pencil beam survey at high galactic latitude such as the hdf - s",
    ", a limited number of foreground stars are expected .",
    "we identify stars as those objects which have a better raw @xmath144 for a single stellar template fit than the @xmath144 for the galaxy template combination .",
    "the stellar templates are the nextgen model atmospheres from @xcite for main sequence stars with temperatures of @xmath153 to @xmath154k , assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "models of cooler and hotter stars can not be included because non - lte effects are important .",
    "we checked the resulting list of stars using the fwhm in the original @xmath34-band image and the @xmath155  color , excluding two objects ( catalog ids 207 and 296 ) that were obviously extended in @xmath34 , and we find a total of 57  stars .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig.cc_ik_jk ] , most galaxies are clearly separated from the stellar locus in @xmath156 versus @xmath155 color - color space .",
    "other cooler stars might still resemble seds of redshifted compact galaxies but the latter are generally redder in the infrared @xmath155  than most known m or methane dwarfs .",
    "known cool l - dwarfs fall along a redder extension of the track traced by m - dwarfs in color - color space and have progressively redder @xmath155 colors for later spectral types .",
    "however measurements by @xcite show the l - dwarf sequence abruptly stopping at @xmath157 ( the subscript noting johnson magnitudes , see section [ reduction.calib ] for the transformations to the ab system ) whereas even cooler t - dwarfs have much bluer @xmath158 colors than expected from their temperatures due to strong molecular absorption .",
    "this is important because if we would apply a @xmath159 photometric criterion to select @xmath160 galaxies ( as discussed in section [ results.colors ] ) , then we should ensure that cool galactic stars are not expected in such a sample .",

    "the hdf - s contains 7 sources redder than @xmath241 and brighter than total magnitude @xmath231 at photometric redshifts @xmath11 , while such galaxies were virtually absent in the hdf - n .",
    "they are much redder than regular u - dropout galaxies in the same field and are candidates for relatively massive , evolved systems at high redshift .",
    "the difference with the hdf - n might just reflect field - to - field variance , calling for more observations to similar limits with full optical - to - infrared coverage .",
    "results from the second and larger fires field centered on ms1054 - 03 @xcite should provide more insight into this issue . * we find substantial numbers of red galaxies with @xmath242 that have photometric redshifts @xmath243 .",
    "these galaxies would be missed by ultraviolet - optical color selection techniques such as the u - dropout method because most of them are barely detectable even in the deepest optical images .",
    "the surface densities of these sources in our field keeps rising down to the detection limit in @xmath2 , in contrast to the number counts of eros which peak at @xmath244 and then drop or flatten at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the results of the hdf - s presented in this paper demonstrate the necessity of extending optical observations to near - ir wavelengths for a more complete census of the early universe .",
    "our deep @xmath2-band data prove invaluable for they probe well into the rest - frame optical at @xmath245 , where long - lived stars may dominate the light of galaxies .",
    "we are pursuing follow - up programs to obtain more spectroscopic redshifts needed to confirm the above results .",
    "updates on the fires programme and access to the reduced images and catalogues can be found at our website http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~{}fires[http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~\\{}fires ] .",
    "the data here presented have been obtained as part of an eso service mode program .",
    "we would very much like to thank the eso staff for their kind assistance and enormous efforts in taking these data and making them available to us .",
    "this project would not be possible without their dedicated work .",
