    "<S> we demonstrated visualization of au nanoparticles buried 300 nm into a polymer matrix by measurement of the thermal noise spectrum of a microcantilever with a tip in contact to the polymer surface . </S>",

    "<S> the variation in the contact stiffness well agreed with the effective stiffness of a simple one - dimensional model , which is consistent with the fact that the maximum depth range of the technique is far beyond the extent of the contact stress field .    </S>",
    "<S> several researchers have recently demonstrated visualization of subsurface features with a nanometer - scale resolution using various imaging schemes based on atomic force microscopy ( afm )  @xcite . as the maximum depth range of the technique reaches on the order of one micrometer and </S>",
    "<S> the potential applications include those in the industrial , biological and medical research fields , much attention has been paid to these techniques . </S>",
    "<S> however , the imaging mechanisms and underlying physics are still not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> this is partly because all the schemes used for subsurface imaging require excitation of the oscillation of the cantilever and/or sample surface , and the key factors contributing to the subsurface contrasts could vary depending on the imaging schemes .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the major imaging schemes is to excite two piezoelectric actuators located at the cantilever base and the bottom of the sample at two different frequencies and detect the flexural oscillation of the cantilever at the beat frequency , which is caused by the nonlinear tip - sample interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the beat frequency is tuned at the contact resonance frequency ( @xmath0 ) of the cantilever to enhance the contribution of the nonlinear coupling to the imaging mechanism as well as the signal - to - noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is referred to as heterodyne force microscopy ( hfm ) or scanning near - field ultrasound holography ( snfuh ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been applied to subsurface imaging for various sample systems with a depth range of a few hundred nm , but mainly for buried hard objects in a soft matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the imaging mechanism by this scheme has been explained as the amplitude and phase modulation of the surface acoustic standing wave resulting from the interference of the ultrasound waves transmitted through the sample and cantilever  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another possible imaging scheme is to excite a piezoelectric actuator located at the bottom of the sample at a frequency close to @xmath0 and detect the flexural oscillation of the cantilever at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is referred to as atomic force acoustic microscopy ( afam )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several researchers also reported visualization of subsurface features with a depth range of a few hundred nm by afam , of whose imaging mechanism was explained by the modulation of the contact stiffness due to the subsurface features  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they also found that the result was consistent with a finite element analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also demonstrated visualization of au nanoparticles buried 900 nm in a polymer matrix using hfm and afam  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we recently measured the contact resonance spectra of the cantilever while the tip was scanned over the surface by sweeping the frequency of the sample excitation at each pixel . </S>",
    "<S> since the contact resonance spectra were not skewed , they were well fitted by the simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) model . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the contact resonance spectrum was affected by the au nanoparticle underneath , and we concluded that the variation in the contact stiffness and damping was playing a major role in making subsurface contrasts in the afam images , while the tip - sample nonlinearity does not seem to significantly contribute  @xcite .    as already mentioned , most of the subsurface imaging experiments have been based on the detection of the cantilever oscillation close to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we now believe that the contact resonance is playing a major role in producing the subsurface contrasts in the afam , at least for the solid nanoparticles buried in a soft matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we then raised the question ; do we really need to excite a cantilever oscillation ? if we just need to measure the contact resonance spectra on the surface for subsurface imaging , it should be possible to do the same thing with the thermal drive of the cantilever . </S>",
    "<S> this was the motivation of the study .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been several reports about the afm measurements of the tip - sample interactions using thermally driven cantilevers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the above question and inspired by these previous studies , we measured the thermal noise spectra of a cantilever on the polymer matrix with buried au nanoparticles by introducing scanning thermal noise microscopy ( stnm ) , which simply collects the contact resonance spectra of the cantilever at each pixel while the tip was scanned over the surface .    in this letter , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate visualization of the au nanoparticles buried 300 nm in a polymer matrix by stnm . </S>",
    "<S> since stnm does not require additional excitation methods of the cantilever base or sample surface , the contact resonance spectrum measured by stnm is free from the spurious peaks that hinder quantitative estimation of the contact stiffness and damping , and the nonlinear tip - sample interaction can be minimized because of a very small oscillation amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we quantitatively evaluated the differences in the contact stiffness and damping of the polymer surface areas with and without the au nanoparticle underneath using a linear spring dashpot model , and discuss the imaging mechanisms by stnm as well as those by other schemes .        </S>",

    "<S> au nanoparticles with diameters of 40 nm dispersed in water with a concentration of @xmath1@xmath2 wt% ( tanaka kikinzoku kogyo ) were dropped onto a 125-@xmath3m - thick polyimide sheet ( dupont  toray : kapton 500v ) . </S>",

    "<S> based on the fitting parameters , the magnitude of the thermal displacement of the tip can also be estimated as about @xmath30 pm and @xmath31 pm on the area with and without the buried au nanoparticle , respectively ( see supplementary information d ) . note that we also calculated @xmath12 and @xmath13 using another fitting function based on the other boundary condition ; i.e. , a concentrated force is applied at the cantilever end , and obtained almost the same results .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss why the au nanoparticles buried at such a depth can influence the surface stiffness and damping and eventually change the boundary conditions . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath41 is related to the effective sample stiffness ( @xmath43 by @xmath44^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath45 denotes the young s moduli of the tip (= 130 gpa)@xcite , and @xmath46 (= 0.18 )  @xcite and @xmath47(= 0.33 )  @xcite are the poisson s ratios of the tip and sample , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath48 value on the area with and without the au nanoparticle were calculated to be 16.7 gpa and 13.5 gpa , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values are much larger than the young s modulus of the top - coat photopolymer film in the literature  @xcite and that experimentally determined ( @xmath49 = 3.4 gpa ) ( see supplementary information e ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the hertzian model predicts that the stress field extends to a depth of about @xmath50@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath37 was about 2 nm in the present case , it is not expected that the effective sample stiffness is affected by the au nanoparticle buried 300 nm from the surface based on the hertzian contact model .    </S>",
    "<S> we also considered the johnson - kendall - roberts ( jkr ) contact model@xcite , in which the adhesion force was taken into account . in the jkr model , @xmath51 and @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> are given by @xmath53 and @xmath54^{1/3}$ ] , respectively , where @xmath55 (= 15 nn ) is the adhesion force . </S>",
    "<S> based on the jkr model , @xmath41 on the area with and without the au nanoparticle were calculated to be 11 gpa and 9 gpa , respectively , from which the @xmath56 values were 10.6 gpa and 8.6 gpa , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation suggests that the young s modulus on the top - coat photopolymer was increased by about 23% . </S>",
    "<S> note that these values are close to the young s modulus of the top - coat photopolymer film in the literature  @xcite , but still greater than the experimental value . </S>",
    "<S> although we consider that the contact condition in the present study is more correctly described by the jkr contact model than by the hertzian model , @xmath57 * by the jkr model was still as low as about 4.5 nm , and it does not account for the variation in the contact stiffness by the deeply buried au nanoparticle .    although the jkr model qualitatively explained the contact stiffness variation , it failed to explain the depth range of the subsurface imaging since the expected elastic stress field was on the order of 10 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we finally noted that we found that the effective young s modulus could be reproduced by considering a one - dimensional model . </S>",
    "<S> we modeled the sample as a two - layer film of the top - coat layer and the au layer . </S>",
    "<S> the variation in thickness of the two - layer film ( @xmath58 ) under a uniform stress ( @xmath59 ) is given by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath49 , and @xmath63 denote the top - coat photopolymer thickness , au nanoparticle diameter , and the young s modulus of the top - coat film and au (= 79 gpa  @xcite ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the effective young s modulus of the multilayer film can now be calculated as @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath49 as 3.4 gpa , the one - dimensional model predicts that young s modulus on the top - coat photopolymer was increased by about 15% , which was consistent with the variation predicted by the stnm measurements and the jkr contact model ( 23% ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we interpreted the subsurface contrasts in the experimental results by stnm as well as by afam as the variation in the contact stiffness and damping because the stress field extends more than expected from the sphere - plane contact models up to several hundreds of nm </S>",
    "<S> . this may be possible due to the anisotropy in the viscoelastic property of the spin - coated photopolymer film and some nonlinear or nanometer - scale effects that have not been considered in the macroscopic contact models . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion is also consistent with the previous studies that explained the subsurface imaging mechanisms using one - dimensional models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further theoretical and experimental studies are necessary to comprehend the imaging mechanisms .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we experimentally performed the visualization of subsurface features by stnm that simply measures the thermal noise spectrum without additional excitation methods . </S>",
    "<S> we realized an ultimate simplification of the measurement scheme and imaged the au nanoparticles buried 300 nm in the photopolymer matrix in the least invasive way . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the subsurface features in the stnm images were brought by the variation in the contact stiffness and damping by the fitting of the theoretical equation to the thermal noise spectra . </S>",
    "<S> it was also shown , based on the jkr contact model , that the young s modulus of the photopolymer surface was increased by 23% due to the presence of the au nanoparticle . however , the contact models failed to explain the imaging mechanisms because the depth of the stress field in the model was more shallow than the depth of the au nanoparticle . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the simple one - dimensional model also predicted the increase in the young s modulus of the photopolymer film by 15% . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we suggest that the imaging of subsurface features is realized by the stress field extension in a quasi - one - dimensional manner . to investigate the detailed one - dimensional strain model , the relationship between the effective young s modulus of the top - coat polymer film and the top - coat thickness will be examined in the near future . as shown by the stnm experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the subsurface features could be solely explained by considering the variation in the viscoelastic properties of the area under the tip . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the subsurface imaging mechanisms of various experimental schemes using the contact resonance might need to be revisited . the stnm technique will serve as a technique to study subsurface imaging mechanisms by the afm related techniques as well as a method to quantitatively evaluate the viscoelastic properties of the sample surface .    </S>",
