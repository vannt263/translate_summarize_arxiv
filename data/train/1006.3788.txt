    "consider a small `` particle '' of mass @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 ) moving freely in an asymptotically - flat background spacetime , say for definiteness schwarzschild or kerr spacetime of mass @xmath2 .",
    "this system emits gravitational waves ( gws ) , and there is a corresponding radiation - reaction influence on the particle s motion .",
    "self - consistently calculating this motion and the emitted gravitational radiation is a long - standing research question , and is interesting both as an abstract problem in general relativity and as an essential prerequisite for the success of the proposed laser interferometer space array ( lisa ) space - based gravitational radiation detector . a typical lisa extreme mass ratio inspiral ( emri ) source is expected to comprise a stellar - mass black hole or neutron star ( the `` particle '' ) orbiting a supermassive black hole with @xmath11 , denotes the solar mass . ] so that @xmath12 to  @xmath13 ; the particle s orbit will typically be both inclined ( with respect to the supermassive black hole s equatorial plane defined by its spin ) and moderately - to - highly eccentric .",
    "lisa is expected to observe many such systems , some of them at quite high signal / noise ratios once the raw data stream is matched - filtered against appropriate waveform templates  ( @xcite ; see section  [ sect - importance - of - highly - accurate - efficient / accuracy / lisa ] for further discussion ) .",
    "the particle s orbit may be highly relativistic , so post - newtonian methods ( see , for example ,  @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) may not be accurate for this problem .",
    "since the timescale for radiation reaction to shrink the orbit is very long ( @xmath14 ) while the required resolution near the particle is very high ( @xmath15 ) , full numerical - relativity methods ( see , for example ,  @xcite and references therein ) are prohibitively expensive for this problem .. although promising initial results have been obtained ( see , for example , @xcite ) , it has not ( yet ) been possible to perform numerical evolutions lasting for radiation - reaction time scales . ] instead , it s appropriate to use black hole perturbation theory , treating the particle as an @xmath3 perturbation on the background schwarzschild or kerr spacetime . a self - consistent calculation of the emitted gravitational radiation requires knowledge of the metric perturbation induced by the particle up to and including @xmath16 terms ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical formalism for such calculations is not yet fully developed ; calculations .",
    "] here i present calculations only for the @xmath3  self force .",
    "building on the early work of dewitt and brehme  @xcite ( with a correction by hobbs  @xcite ) , the @xmath3 `` misataquwa '' equations of motion for a gravitational point particle in a ( strong - field ) curved spacetime were first derived by mino , sasaki , and tanaka  @xcite and quinn and wald  @xcite ( see also detweiler s analysis  @xcite ) , and have recently been rederived in a more rigorous manner by gralla and wald  @xcite .",
    "gralla , harte , and wald  @xcite have also recently obtained a rigorous derivation of the electromagnetic self - force in a curved spacetime . ]",
    "see @xcite for general reviews of the self - force problem .",
    "the particle s motion may be modelled as either ( i ) non - geodesic motion in the background schwarzschild / kerr spacetime under the influence of a radiation - reaction `` self - force '' , or ( ii ) geodesic motion in a perturbed spacetime .",
    "these two perspectives are equivalent  @xcite ; in this work i use  ( i ) .",
    "the misataquwa equations then give the self - force in terms of ( the gradient of ) the metric perturbation due to the particle , which must be computed using black - hole perturbation theory .",
    "the computation of the metric perturbation due to a point particle is particularly difficult because the `` perturbation '' is formally infinite at the particle .",
    "a practical `` mode - sum '' scheme to regularize the metric perturbation was developed by barack and ori  @xcite , and in slightly different forms by detweiler , messaritaki , and whiting  @xcite and haas and poisson  @xcite . here",
    "i follow the barack - ori `` @xmath8-mode '' regularization ( described in detail in  @xcite and summarized in section  [ sect - barack - ori ] ) .",
    "this is based on a spherical - harmonic decomposition of the metric perturbation , allowing the 4-vector self - force @xmath17 to be written as an infinite sum of regularized modes @xmath18 .",
    "each regularized mode @xmath19 is calculated by solving a set of linear partial differential equations ( pdes ) , computing certain derivatives of the pde solutions along the particle worldline , and finally subtracting certain analytically - known regularization coefficients .",
    "depending on how the pdes are solved , there are two broad classes of self - force computations within the mode - sum regularization framework : frequency - domain and time - domain .",
    "frequency - domain computations involve a fourier transform of each mode s pdes in time , reducing the numerical computation to the solution of a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for each mode ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "frequency - domain computations are typically very efficient and accurate for circular or near - circular particle orbits , . ] but degrade rapidly in efficiency with increasing eccentricity of the particle s orbit , becoming impractical for highly eccentric orbits  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , time - domain computations involve a direct numerical integration of each mode s pdes , and have traditionally been somewhat less efficient and accurate than frequency - domain computations .",
    "however , time - domain computations can accommodate arbitrary particle orbits with only minor penalties in performance and accuracy ( @xcite ) , and some complications in the numerical schemes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "i use the time - domain approach , using an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code with 4th  order finite differencing  @xcite to solve each mode s pdes very accurately and efficiently . to simplify the boundary treatment ,",
    "i use a characteristic ( double - null ) evolution scheme .",
    "i restrict consideration to the model problem of computing the self - force on a scalar particle moving in schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this is a widely - used test problem in the field of self - force calculations , with past numerical computations including  @xcite .. ) the gravitational self - force has been studied by numerous authors , including  @xcite.]@xmath20 for the numerical computations presented here , i further restrict consideration to the computation of the radial component of the self - force for a scalar particle in a circular geodesic orbit about the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "however , i also simulate the accuracy to be expected when similar methods are applied to generic non - circular particle orbits .",
    "the basic mode - sum technique for self - force computation discussed here is already well - known .",
    "the main new results in this paper concern ( a ) the ( small ) extension of these techniques to accommodate the use of characteristic amr for the numerical integrations , ( b ) the error estimates for such a self - force computation , ( c ) the validation of these error estimates using a large set of numerical computations of widely - varying accuracies , ( d ) the tail fit s ill - conditioning , ( e ) the cost / accuracy tradeoffs for the computation , and ( f ) the demonstration of consistency at levels of @xmath21 parts per million ( ppm ) relative error between the time - domain self - force computations presented here and the highly - accurate frequency - domain computations of detweiler , messaritaki , and whiting  @xcite .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows :",
