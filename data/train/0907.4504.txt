    "this observation seems to be consistent with the predictions from the canonical statistical model @xcite , though the enhancement of strange hadrons could be not solely due to the canonical suppression in smaller systems  @xcite .",

    "the conventional models of the cronin effect attribute the change of @xmath12 spectra in p+a to multiple parton scattering in initial stage before hard parton scattering , which will broaden the outgoing parton / hadron @xmath12 distribution @xcite , while the recombination model predicts the particle type ( baryon / meson ) dependence of the cronin effect . in fig .",
