    "in this paper , we study granular materials where energy is provided by a vibrating plate [ see fig .",

    "the particles move together in a coherent layer , bouncing at some frequency related to the vibration frequency .",
    "this state exhibits surface waves , and has been the subject of much recent work @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the motion is incoherent .",
    "the particles remain suspended above the vibrating plate , with a density profile that  excluding fluctuations",
    " remains constant throughout the vibration period .",
    "this second state has also been the subject of recent experiments , simulations and theories @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study this second type of motion .",
    "we search for a basic understanding of the physical processes which govern the input and dissipation of energy .",
    "this is a question of theoretical interest , because it provides a good test of kinetic theories of granular media .",
    "these theories , modeled after the kinetic theory of gases@xcite have been shown to have quantitative success only for unforced granular media in the absence of gravity @xcite .",
    "however , incoherent vibrated granular materials may be an experimentally accessible system well described by these theories.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

[",

    "[ sec : pb ] , we will estimate the effect of this approximation on the energy input at the vibrating wall .",
    "we consider collisions with constant normal and tangential restitution coefficients .",
    "this collision model has been widely studied and is relatively easy to analyze theoretically .",
    "the normal ( tangential ) restitution coefficient for collisions between particles is denoted @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , and for collisions between the particles and the side walls @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the vibrating floor is elastic ( @xmath21 ) and smooth ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "more details on the collision rule are presented in appendix  [ sec : collrule ] .",
    "we describe the state of the system with three types of energy , each defined per degree of freedom , per particle : @xmath23 , the translational kinetic energy of the particles , @xmath24 , their rotational energy , and @xmath25 , their gravitational potential energy .",
    "these energies are calculated as follows : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the translational velocity of the @xmath28 particle , @xmath29 is its angular velocity , and @xmath30 is its height above the time averaged position of the vibrating floor .",

    "the `` holy grail '' of this paper are expressions for the energies @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 in terms of the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 , together with a physical understanding of the system .",

    "we will try to express each of these quantities in terms of @xmath23 and the system parameters .",

    "a similar method has been used in other recent work @xcite .",
    "the fraction of dissipationless collisions is always less than @xmath42 for the simulations shown here .",
    "in addition , we repeated the three simulations that had the most dissipationless collisions , approaching more closely the inelastic collapse singularity , and found no measurable change    in the simulations presented here , we use the particle radius to define the unit of distance , and the particle mass to define the unit of mass .",
    "the unit of time is arbitrary . to apply our results to experimental systems",
    ", it is necessary to introduce conversion factors based on the particle mass and the particle radius , and to choose @xmath6 and @xmath5 so that @xmath43 has the same value as the experimental system .    in order to vary the system parameters in a consistent and organized way",

    "first , ` central ' values were selected for all the parameters except @xmath7 .",

    "the central values used in this paper are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "most of the quantities measured during the simulations must be averaged over long periods of time to obtain stable results . to obtain a suitable averaging time ,",

    "the reason for this dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath108 is unknown .",

    "we imagine a column of @xmath123 particles , suspended in a gravitational field by the vibrating plate at the bottom of the column .",

    "we note that @xmath189 must be carefully calculated ; if @xmath189 is taken to be the height above the lowest position of the floor instead of the height above the average position of the floor , the simulations with @xmath196 fall off the curve .",

    "11 of ref .",
    "there remain three differences between these simulations and those of ref .",
    "first , ref .",
    "@xcite uses a more complicated collision rule , where the tangential restitution coefficient varies between @xmath215 and an upper limit @xmath216 , depending on the impact parameter . in our simulations ,",
    "the tangential restitution coefficient is the same for all collisions .",
    "secondly , ref .",
    "@xcite used slightly polydisperse spheres , whereas we use monodisperse spheres .",
    "finally , we replace the sinusoidal wave form of ref .",
    "@xcite by wave form @xmath16 . in spite of these differences ,",
    "the simulations presented here show the same behavior as those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we show two versions of the theory , one which takes into account the logarithmic dependence of @xmath98 ( the solid lines ) and the other which does not ( the dotted lines ) .",
    "the solid lines reproduce the observed dependence @xmath217 for @xmath218 , whereas the dotted lines show @xmath219 .",
    "thus , the puzzling scaling observed in previous work @xcite is due to the logarithmic dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath193 .",
    "this dependence does not yet have a theoretical explanation .    for @xmath220",
    ", there is a significant disagreement for the simulations with dissipative walls ( @xmath221 ) , which can be traced back to the failure of the assumption @xmath222 .",
    "this paper has studied the two dimensional vibrated granular media , using the energy balance eq .",
    "( [ eq : energybalance ] ) to organize our investigation . reviewing existing theories , we find the particle - particle dissipation is well understood in the dilute limit .",
    "we were able to show that eq .",
    "( [ eq : kumarandpp ] ) is very accurate in the absence of side walls .",
    "this result was extended to deal with rough rotating particles with a constant tangential restitution coefficient .",
    "more work is needed to account for the more realistic situation of variable tangential restitution . in the dilute limit",
    ", particle - particle dissipation is well accounted for by existing theories , but in the dense limit , it shows an unexplained dependence on the height of the center of mass above the vibrating bottom , @xmath193 , well approximated by a logarithm .",
    "it is this departure from the dilute theory which accounts for the @xmath223 scaling observed in previous work .",
    "the cause of this departure is not yet known : it is not due to a change in density , since it depends only on the height of the center of mass . nor can it be explained by waves propagating upwards from the bottom .",
    "furthermore , the ratio between potential and kinetic energy , @xmath197 , can vary by almost a factor of @xmath224 .",
    "this variation is not understood , and hampers the ability of our theory to predict @xmath193 .",
    "the energy input by the vibrating plate is also well known for the special driving wave form @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig : system](b ) . for more conventional wave forms ,",
    "the energy input is well approximated by the exponentially decaying function of @xmath86 shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pwall ] ) .    to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first paper to treat particle - wall dissipation in detail .",
    "our theory accurately predicts energy losses at the wall , but requires knowing the difference between the horizontal and vertical kinetic energies .",
    "a more complete theory would have to estimate this difference from the system parameters .",
    "we acknowledge the generous support of the alexander von humboldt - stiftung and the dfg , sfb 382 ( a6 ) .",
    "consider a collision between two particles of radius @xmath10 .",

    ". then the relative velocity at the point of contact is @xmath231 here , the unit vector @xmath232 points along the line connecting the centers of the colliding particles , from particle 2 towards particle 1 .",
    "the change in the normal component of @xmath233 is parameterized by the `` coefficient of normal restitution '' @xmath17 , so that @xmath234 , where the prime denotes the velocity after the collision . when @xmath235 , energy is conserved , and energy dissipation requires @xmath236 .",
