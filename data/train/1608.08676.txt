    "one of the simplest is given by the tree level realization of the weinberg operator  @xcite , which gives rise to the well - known type - i  @xcite , type - ii  @xcite and type - iii  @xcite seesaw mechanism , in where , an @xmath2 fermion singlet , scalar triplet and fermion triplet are added respectively . on the other hand",
