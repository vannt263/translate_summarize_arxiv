    "mode - selective chemistry , that is the control of specific conformational changes or chemical reactions by directing energy into specific vibrational modes of a molecule , has been a major goal and challenge of modern chemical physics @xcite . a variety of different routes to achieve mode - selective chemistry have been considered . for example , ultrafast excitation of molecules by laser pulses provided a route for directing energy transiently into specific mode - excitation or bond - cleavage in the presence of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution ( ivr ) processes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , on long time scales the statistical distribution of energy usually prevails and the control of specific conformational changes or chemical reactions by directing energy into specific vibrational modes still represents a challenge @xcite .    in recent years , much interest has been devoted to the study of molecular systems out of equilibrium , in particular single - molecule junctions @xcite .",
    "these junctions consist of a single molecule that is clamped between two metal or semi - conductor electrodes . if these electrodes are set to different electrochemical potentials by applying an external bias voltage , electrons tunnel from one lead to the other trough the molecule .",
    "the geometrical structure of the molecular bridge , due to its small size and mass , is very sensitive to charge fluctuations induced by these tunneling processes .",
    "the tunneling electrons thus strongly interact with the vibrational degrees of freedom of the junction @xcite .",
    "the distribution of vibrational energy on the molecular bridge , which results from these interactions , is highly correlated with the applied bias voltage and often deviates from a boltzmann distribution @xcite . in a single - molecule junction",
    ", it is thus possible to control a `` non - statistical '' non - equilibrium distribution of vibrational energy by an external potential bias .",
    "this offers an alternative route to mode - selective excitation ( or mode - selective chemistry ) .",
    "moreover , in the steady - state transport regime of a molecular junction , this could be achieved even without the cumbersome preparation of a specific initial - state .    employing generic model systems , we have recently shown @xcite that in a single - molecule junction the excitation of vibrational modes can be , indeed , selectively controlled by the external bias voltage . considering molecules with an asymmetric orbital structure and vibronic coupling to specific normal modes , it was demonstrated that , by adjusting the external bias voltage , such a system can be driven into different non - equilibrium states with different levels of excitation for specific nuclear modes .",
    "particularly , the excitation of a high frequency mode can be tuned much higher than that of a low frequency mode , thus overcoming the statistical distribution of vibrational energy that favors the excitation of low frequency modes . in this article",
    ", we extend our previous studies @xcite , where the principle of mode - selective vibrational excitation ( msve ) in a single - molecule junction was demonstrated for the first time . to this end",
    ", we outline in detail how the excitation of a single vibrational mode can be controlled by an external bias voltage .",
    "this bias - controlled excitation is then generalized to more than one vibrational mode , reviewing the basic msve phenomenon and emphasizing the role of intra - molecular interactions .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate msve in the presence of electronically mediated mode - mode coupling @xcite , which results from coupling of the vibrational modes to the same electronic state .",
    "these interactions induce energy transfer between the vibrational modes and tend to distribute current - induced vibrational excitation between the different modes .",
    "similarly , electronic correlations , _ e.g. _  due to coulomb repulsion , may influence msve by reorganizing the electronic population between specific electronic states at the molecule , which , to some extent and in different ways , is related to the phenomenon of msve . extending our previous work , we investigate complementary models for asymmetric molecular junctions exhibiting msve .",
    "these models are related , for example , to experiments on single - molecule junctions performed with a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) @xcite .    to describe this nonequilibrium transport problem ,",
    "we employ two complementary approaches .",
    "the first one is a master equation approach ( me ) that is based on the time - evolution of the reduced density matrix of the molecular bridge @xcite .",
    "the respective equation of motion is evaluated strictly to second - order in the molecule - lead coupling , for which all resonant transport processes are included .",
    "within such a framework , no approximations with respect to the interactions on the molecular bridge need to be invoked , in particular not with respect to electron - electron interactions or electronic - vibrational coupling .",
    "however , higher - order processes @xcite like co - tunneling processes or the broadening of molecular levels due to the molecule - lead coupling are missing in this description . note that master equation approaches that take into account such higher - order effects have already been put forward @xcite . in the present work , however , we selected a nonequilibrium green s function approach ( negf ) @xcite to account for the higher - order effects .",
    "especially for the description of multiple vibrational modes @xcite , the negf methodology is typically more efficient .",
    "we employ a nonequilibrium green s function approach , which was originally proposed by galperin _",
    "_ @xcite and recently extended to account for multiple vibrational and multiple electronic degrees of freedom of the molecular bridge @xcite .",
    "other theoretical approaches used to describe electron transport through a single - molecule junction are based _",

    "@xcite , multiconfigurational wave - function methods @xcite , flux - correlation approaches @xcite or exact diagonalization @xcite .",

    "[ msve ] , we discuss msve in two model systems , representing generic asymmetric molecular junctions : a single - molecule junction with an intrinsically asymmetric molecular bridge ( model a ) @xcite , and a junction , where the bridging molecule is asymmetrically coupled to the leads ( model b ) .",
    "the latter scenario is typical for stm experiments .",
    "we demonstrate that the magnitude and the polarity of the external bias voltage can be used to direct vibrational energy into specific vibrational modes , even in the presence of intra - molecular interactions that tend to suppress the effect .",
    "thus , we predict that in the steady - state transport regime of a molecular junction , a bias - controlled `` non - statistical '' distribution of vibrational energy can be realized , where modes with higher frequency ( stronger bonds ) can be much higher excited than modes with a lower frequency ( weaker bonds ) .",

    "considering a molecule with multiple vibrational modes and typical asymmetries in the vibronic as well as molecule - lead couplings , the level of excitation of specific vibrational modes can thus be tuned by the polarity and the magnitude of the external bias voltage . *",
    "_ the role of asymmetry and intra - molecular interactions _ +",
    "our studies suggest that msve is a rather general phenomenon and is likely to be observed experimentally .",
    "the required asymmetry in the electronic interaction between different molecular states and the leads may be due to an inherent asymmetric molecular structure ( model a ) or stem from an inherent difference between the two electrodes , as _",
    "e.g. _  in stm experiments ( model b ) .",
    "intra - molecular interactions , _ e.g. _  due to off diagonal electronic - vibrational coupling or electron - electron repulsion tend to redistribute the excitation energy between the different modes , and thus work against msve .",
    "however , having analyzed a broad range of parameters , we found the msve phenomenon to prevail even in the presence of such interactions . *",
    "_ the importance of off - resonant processes : comparing me to negf calculations .",
    "_ + our numerical studies of generic models of molecular junctions were based on two complementary theoretical methods : a nonequilibrium green s function approach @xcite and a master equation approach @xcite .",
    "both approaches are based on a second - order expansion in the coupling of the molecular bridge to the leads .",
    "while the negf method also accounts for higher - order effects , the me approach describes only resonant electron tunneling processes .",
    "however , intra - molecular interactions , either due to electronic - vibrational coupling or electron - electron interactions , can be described by the me method without invoking further approximations , while these interactions are described by our negf approach approximately in terms of a non - perturbative scheme .",
    "although the results obtained by both methodologies agree in most cases reasonably well , further insights into the relevant mechanisms can be gained when the results exhibit differences .",
    "thus , for example , the importance of off - resonant electron - hole pair creation processes for local cooling @xcite of vibrational modes in the high - bias regime could be revealed .",
    "we end by noting that this work considered only generic models to study the basic mechanisms and prerequisites of bias - controlled msve .",
    "the identification of specific molecules that exhibit msve requires transport studies based on first - principles electronic structure calculations @xcite",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .",
    "another interesting extension concerns the external control mechanism for msve . in the present work ,",
    "we have considered an external bias voltage as the means to control msve . a gate electrode @xcite may provide another tool for addressing a molecular junction with an electric field , and thus ,",
    "may also be used to control vibrational excitation .",
    "finally , in the context of mode - selective chemistry , studies of msve in single - molecule junctions may pave the way to control chemical processes in molecules adsorbed on surfaces .",
    "for example , an additional electrode that provides an external potential bias may induce catalytic reactions in a selective manner .",
