    "this series of papers describes a set of very deep mid - infrared observations , obtained using the isocam ( cesarsky et al . 1996 ) instrument on the infared space observatory ( iso , kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) and centred on the hubble deep field ( hdf , williams et al .",
    "1996 ) region . in paper",
    "( serjeant et al . 1997 ) we discussed the reduction of the isocam data and presented the resultant maps of the hdf region at 6.7@xmath0 m and 15@xmath0 m .",
    "paper ii ( goldschmidt et al . 1997 ) described the methods we used for detecting sources in these maps , while paper iii ( oliver et al . 1997 ) compared source counts derived from these detections with model predictions .",
    "the two principal goals of this paper are to confirm the iso - hdf sources , through associating them with objects in existing hdf galaxy catalogues , and to study the properties of those associated galaxies , contrasting them with those of bright hdf galaxies not detected by iso .",
    "the spectral energy distributions resulting from the association procedure will be discussed in paper v ( rowan - robinson et al . 1997 ) , together with their implications for the star formation history of the universe .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the basic problems we face in associating the iso - hdf sources with galaxies in existing hdf catalogues .",
    "the likelihood ratio method for source identification is described in section 3 , where we present the results of applying it to our iso - hdf sources and discuss the reliability of the associations we made using it . in section 4",
    "we discuss the properties of the galaxies associated with our iso sources , as well as those prominent optical hdf galaxies we did not detect , and present the conclusions that we draw from the work described in this paper .",
    "a total of 27 sources ( 7 in the complete sample , and 20 in the supplementary sample ) were detected in the 6.7 @xmath0 m map together with 22 sources ( 19 complete , 3 supplementary ) at 15 @xmath0 m : the positions and fluxes of these objects are tabulated in paper ii .",
    "there are several basic problems which complicate the association of iso - hdf sources with hdf galaxies in existing optical and near - infrared catalogues .",
    "the most obvious of these is the poor match between the resolution of isocam and the high source density of galaxies in the hdf : the radius of the airy disk is 2.8 arcsec at 6.7@xmath0 m and 6.0 arcsec at 15@xmath0 m , while there are several hundred galaxies per square arcminute detected to @xmath1 , so we expect several galaxies per randomly placed airy disk at both 6.7 @xmath0 m and 15 @xmath0 m .",
    "_ unless otherwise stated , the magnitudes used in this paper are total magnitudes in the ab system , as measured by williams et al . 1996 , and we follow them in denoting their four optical bands as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 to avoid confusion with the standard johnson photometric bands . ) thus , not only is there a high likelihood of chance associations with optical galaxies , but any given isocam beam may be integrating over more than one source , and significant flux may be contributed by more than one galaxy : this latter is exacerbated both because many luminous mid - infrared sources are likely to be interacting or merging galaxy systems ( e.g. lawrence et al .",
    "1989 ) , and by the fact that our iso maps appear to be at , or close to , the confusion limit in both bands ( paper i ) .",
    "an additional positional uncertainty results from the possibility of field distortions in the original iso data ( paper i ) .",
    "we make some allowance for this in our source association procedure ( see section 3 ) , and feel that it is unlikely to affect our results significantly .",
    "another issue is the band in which to make the associations , since , clearly , the wide range of colours exhibited by hdf galaxies could mean that different galaxies would be associated with a particular iso source in different bands , and an unfortunate choice of band could bias the associations made : for example , we might expect the true counterparts of our iso galaxies to be dusty , so using too blue a band might lead us to make the wrong associations . with that in mind we have performed the likelihood ratio procedure of section 3 on the @xmath5 images of williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which is both the reddest and deepest band , as well as the only one available in the hubble flanking fields ( hff ) .",
    "finally , we have relatively few sources ( only 19 of the 6.7@xmath0 m sources and 5 of those at 15@xmath0 m have airy disks which fall within the hdf ) , restricting our ability to use statistical techniques which rely on the determination of properties of the source population from the data themselves .    as a first step towards our goals ,",
    "we compare the @xmath5 band magnitude distribution of galaxies near our iso - hdf source positions with that of the complete optical hdf galaxy catalogue of williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the @xmath5 band magnitude distribution of those hdf galaxies within twice the airy disk radius of the 19 6.7@xmath0 m iso - hdf source positions lying within the hdf , together with that for the full williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) optical galaxy catalogue .",
    "the histogram for the iso - hdf neighbours is noisy , both because of the small number of sources , and because a number of them lie close to the edge of the hdf , and the correction made for the fraction of the search region outside the hdf can give large weights to those hdf galaxies inside it .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "1 that there is an excess of bright ( @xmath6 ) galaxies surrounding our iso - hdf source positions : a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test yields a probability @xmath7 that the two magnitude distributions are drawn from the same population ( falling to @xmath8 when only the six sources from the complete 6.7@xmath0 m sample are considered ) , and the five 15@xmath0 m sources in the hdf yield similar results .",
    "this strongly suggests that the sources in our iso - hdf samples are associated with bright galaxies in the hdf .",
    "the likelihood ratio method is one of the most commonly used techniques for associating _ sources _ in one catalogue with _",
    "objects _ in another : it is described in detail by sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) , so we present only a brief review here . the likelihood ratio , @xmath9 , is defined to be the ratio of the probability , @xmath10 , of finding the true counterpart to the source at the position of the object and with its flux , to the probability , @xmath11 , of finding a chance object at that position and with that flux , given the errors in the source and object positions .",
    "consider an object with positional offsets @xmath12 from the estimated source position and with flux @xmath13 .",
    "the probability that the true counterpart lies in an infinitesimal region of area @xmath14 about that position and has a flux in an infinitesimal interval of size @xmath15 about that flux , is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the joint probability distribution function for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , normalised so that and @xmath20 is the probability distribution function for an ensemble of sources , measured in the passband in which the object catalogue is defined .",
    "if @xmath21 is the local surface density of objects per unit flux , then and @xmath9 is given by @xmath22 to implement this method to associate iso - hdf sources with objects in the stsci hdf optical catalogue ( williams et al .",
    ", 1996 ) , we make the following assumptions concerning the quantities present in equation ( [ lr_final ] ) .",
    "we neglect the uncertainties in the optical positions , setting @xmath17 equal to a gaussian distribution , with a @xmath23 value equal to the quadrature sum of the radius of the airy disk for the iso sources ( 2.8 arcsec at 7@xmath0 m and 6.0 arcsec at 15@xmath0 m ) and an estimated positional error of equal size : this is a crude estimate of the true positional uncertainties , designed , in part , to take account of the possibility of isocam field distortions , but the associations made are insensitive to variation of this figure within reasonable bounds .",
    "the form of @xmath21 , which is the magnitude distribution of the galaxies in the @xmath5 band , is readily computed , but the choice of @xmath20 is more problematic . as discussed by sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) , the two conventional approaches would involve assuming some model for the magnitude distribution of the true optical counterparts of our iso - hdf sources , or estimating @xmath20 from the data , which , essentially , means taking the difference between the pair of histograms shown in fig .",
    "1 . the latter method would , clearly , yield an unsatisfactorily noisy @xmath20 ( particularly for the 15@xmath0 m sources ) , while sufficiently little is known about the mid - infrared properties of the galaxies we are likely to detect with iso in the hdf that adopting a model based , say , on iras data , could seriously bias our results .",
    "we choose , instead , to take @xmath20 equal to a constant , independent of magnitude : uncertainty as to the exact reliability of our iso samples means that the value this constant should take remains unclear , so that the likelihood ratios we compute are left unnormalised , proportional to those defined by equation ( [ lr_final ] ) .",
    "this uniform @xmath20 is , no doubt , incorrect , since , on the evidence of fig .",
    "1 ( as well as _ a priori _ prejudice ) the galaxies we detect are likely to be amongst the brightest in the hdf .",
    "its effect , given that point , is to make us more likely to identify our iso sources with fainter galaxies than we should be .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , our associations are with bright galaxies , which suggests that our taking a uniform @xmath20 has not biased our results .",
    "deciding what level of likelihood ratio we consider to correspond to a reliable association is a somewhat subjective matter .",
    "independent of the application of the likelihood ratio technique , two of us ( rgm and mrr ) made independent associations by eye , using @xmath5 images of the hdf fields , with the airy disks of the iso - hdf sources superimposed upon them . in making these associations we are likely to have been making a subconscious balance between the brightness of a given galaxy and its distance from the source position , qualitatively similar to the likelihood ratio method , where @xmath24 .",
    "nevertheless , the level of agreement obtained , both between the two observers and with the results of the likelihood ratio analysis , is surprising : for all but one source the two observers agreed on the most likely association , and the sources which they felt confident in having associated reliably were in a one - to - one correspondence with the sources yielding the highest likelihood ratios .    we can estimate the level of reliability of these associations by considering the likelihood ratios for association with random points in the hdf . in fig .",
    "2 we show the cumulative probability distribution for the likelihood ratio of the most likely hdf galaxy for being the optical counterpart of a fictitious 6.7@xmath0 m source at a random position in the hdf , computed using the same forms for @xmath20 and @xmath21 as for the iso - hdf sources and 10000 random positions in the hdf . from fig .",
    "2 we can compute , as a function of @xmath9 , the quantity @xmath25 , which is the probability that a fictitious source , placed at random in the hdf , would have a likeliest association in the @xmath5 catalogue of williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with a likelihood ratio at least as high as a given value of @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath25 values for the best optical candidates for the 6.7@xmath0 m sources marking the boundary above which the observers conservatively considered their associations to be reliable was about @xmath26 .",
    "we chose this conservative level to mark the break between those associations we consider to be reliable and those we do not .    in table 1",
    "we list the properties of the hdf galaxies which are our preferred associations for the 15 iso - hdf sources we take as having reliable associations in the hdf region : these data are used to compute the spectral energy distributions of the galaxies in paper v.    the same procedure was then applied to an @xmath5 band hff catalogue , resulting in the association of a further 11 iso - hdf sources with hff objects ( 10 galaxies and 1 star ) : the construction of this catalogue is described in the appendix , where the hff associations are tabulated .",
    "these results , taken together , provide lower limits to the reliability of the four iso - hdf samples ; lower limits because we have been conservative in accepting associations as reliable , and a substantial number of further associations fall just below our threshold , and might rise above it , for example , once more is known of the field distortions in isocam data .",
    "the 6.7@xmath0 m and 15@xmath0 m complete samples are at least 71 per cent and 68 per cent reliable , respectively , while the reliabilities of the supplementary 6.7@xmath0 m and 15@xmath0 m samples are no worse than 35 per cent and 67 per cent respectively .      in this subsection",
