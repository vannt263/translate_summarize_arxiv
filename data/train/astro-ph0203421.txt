    "in 1918 , it was discovered in the equations of general relativity by thirring and lense [ 1 ] that the angular momentum of a massive body causes inertial frames to be dragged around in the direction that the mass is rotating . in 1969 , roger penrose [ 2 ] noted that , inside the ergosphere of a rotating black hole , this frame dragging is so extreme that it can provide a way to extract rotational energy ( we now call this the penrose mechanism ) . in this paper ,",
    "i present the results of the first _ complete _ , fully general relativistic , four - dimensional , theoretical and numerical model calculation using the penrose mechanism to extract high energy electrons and photons from a rotating black hole .",
    "penrose scattering processes in the ergosphere allow high energy particles to escape to infinity ( far away from the black hole ) with a portion of the rotational energy of the kerr black hole ( kbh ) , and orbital energy - momentum produced by its strong gravitational field .",
    "this model calculation not only confirms the results of energy extracted from penrose compton scattering processes given in [ 3,4 ] , however , extracting higher energies when nonequatorially confined targets are introduced , but this model gives space momenta of individual scattered particles , thus , in this sense , making it a complete calculation .",
    "importantly , the penrose pair production , by photons in bound unstable _ trapped _ orbits with photons on radially infalling geodesics , at the _ photon orbit _ , allow electron - positron ( @xmath3 ) pairs to escape with energies as high as @xmath4  gev ( implying a lorentz factor @xmath5 ) , or higher depending on properties of the accretion disk .",
    "up until the investigation reported here and the related paper of [ 5 ] , such penrose pair production ( ppp ) at the photon orbit had yet to be proposed .",
    "the reason for this is probably because the trajectories for massless and material particles , in nonequatorially confined orbits , i.e. , orbits not confined to the equatorial plane of the kbh , had to be solved first to obtain analytical expressions for the conserved energy @xmath6 and conserved azimuthal angular momentum @xmath7 , as measured by an observer at infinity ; this is done in [ 5 ] , and the results are presented again here in section  [ sec:2a ] .    the @xmath8 penrose process utilizes the existence of retrograde particle orbits ( with respect to the rotation of the kbh ) in the ergosphere , for which the energy , as would be measured by an observer at infinity , is negative [ 2,3 ] .",
    "such orbits do not come out to infinity .",
    "however , it is possible for a particle , say @xmath9 , that has fallen inwardly from infinity into the ergosphere to scatter off another particle , say @xmath10 , initially in a direct orbit inside the ergosphere .",
    "if the orbit of the scattering particle @xmath10 changes into a retrograde orbit ( of negative energy ) , then the scattered particle @xmath9 can escape to infinity with more mass - energy than the sum of the initial energies of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "since the orbit of the initially bound particle @xmath10 is dependent on the angular momentum of the kbh and the curvature of spacetime defined by the mass of the hole , when @xmath10 gives up energy to the escaping particle @xmath9 and falls into the event horizon , the kbh loses energy in the form of rotational energy .",
    "one plausible class of penrose processes occurs when particles already inside the ergosphere ( say particles of an accretion disk ) undergo _ local relativistic scatterings _ [ 6,7 ] .",
    "such types are considered in this investigation .",
    "if one of the scattering particles is initially in a bound orbit , then it is possible for the other initially unbound scattered particle , or the new particles created in the scattering process , to escape to infinity with rotational energy - momentum from the kbh , extracted either directly ( classical penrose process ) or indirectly ( quasi - penrose process ) , as defined in [ 5 ] .",
    "this process allows scattered ergospheric particles to ( 1 ) escape to infinity with more mass - energy than they would have had if the scattering occurred outside the ergosphere and ( 2 ) escape to infinity with mass - energy initially trapped by the kbh , mass - energy near the event horizon that had no other way of escaping , except by such processes as these penrose processes ; otherwise this trapped mass - energy would eventually be accreted into the black hole .",
    "that is , since , in general , nothing can come out of the black hole ( including for orbits near the event horizon ) , then a physical process near the hole , such as a penrose process , is necessary to inject a trapped or `` plunging '' orbiting particle into an escaping orbit [ 7 ] . in other words , these so - called penrose processes provide a way for blueshifted mass - energy , initially trapped by the kbh , to escape to infinity .",
    "the model calculations discussed in this paper consist of using the monte carlo method to treat penrose processes in the ergosphere of a kbh .",
    "the processes investigated are penrose compton scattering ( pcs ) , @xmath11-ray  proton ppp ( @xmath12 ) , and @xmath11-ray@xmath11-ray ppp ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these three processes are assumed to occur in material that has fallen into the ergospheric region of a rotating black hole from a surrounding accretion disk .",
    "the monte carlo method is applied to the cross section of each scattering event to determine values of the scattering angles and final energies as measured by local observers .    in [ 5",
    "] , i present the detailed model calculations for the above penrose scattering processes ; the final outcome is the four - momenta of the scattered particles as measured by an observer at infinity . the important properties and relations found from the model calculations of [ 5 ] are described in this paper .",
    "now , of the three penrose scattering processes investigated , the most rewarding ones were the pcs and the ppp ( @xmath13 ) : these two processes are specifically discussed in this paper . unfortunately , the ppp ( @xmath12 ) as suggested in [ 8,9 ] did not allow any of the scattered @xmath3 pairs to escape , mainly because of the large inward radial momentum acquired by the assumed radially infalling incident photon at the scattering radius , too large for the pairs to be scattered outward by the target orbiting proton : i refer the reader to [ 5 ] for details concerning this scattering process .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the astrophysically interesting features found by looking carefully at the emission spectra of the penrose scattered particles .",
    "two of the most important features of the scattered particles are the following : ( 1 )  large fluxes of relativistic @xmath3 pairs with energies as high as @xmath14  gev can escape ; and ( 2 ) the rotation of the kbh can cause the scattered particles to escape with asymmetrical distributions , above and below the equatorial plane , thus , naturally aiding in the production of one - sided jets of relativistic particles .",
    "feature ( 2 ) is a general relativistic effect caused by the gravitomagnetic field [ 10 ] ( i.e. , the gravitational analog or resemblance of a magnetic field ) , due to the angular momentum of the rotating black hole .",
    "this gravitomagnetic ( gm ) field , as described in section  [ sec:2d ] , causes the dragging of inertial frames , while at the same time produces a force which acts on the momentum vector of a particle in its field , and which , for small velocities ( @xmath15 ) , is linear in the particle s velocity . both of the above features are important ingredients in what would be needed to explain the observed spectra of quasars and other agns . note ,",
    "feature ( 2 ) implies that , near the event horizon the expected reflection symmetry of the kerr metric , above and below the equatorial plane , appears to be broken due to the gm force field .",
    "it has been suggested [ 11 ] that the one - sided or asymmetrical jets of radio strong quasars and radio galaxies may be intrinsically related to the energy source .",
    "the reason for this suggestion is that many of the observed one - sided jet distributions of agns do not conform with that predicted if the one - sidedness is due solely to relativistic beaming  of the emission axis of the jet into a direction near the line of sight of the observer  wherein doppler boosting of the radiation causes the approaching jet to be apparently brighter than the receding jet . yet , up until the investigation reported here , no model has been proposed for the energy source that would exhibit such asymmetrical properties .",
    "herein , however , from these penrose scattering processes [ 5 ] , i present evidence that the rotating black hole core energy source may be producing two of the important observed features of agns : the large energy fluxes of @xmath3 pairs inferred to emerge from their cores , and asymmetry in their jet and counter jet distributions .",
    "moreover , findings by dennett - thorpe et  al .",
    "[ 12 ] , after studying the asymmetry of jets , lobe length , and spectral index in a sample of quasars , with well defined jets , led them to conclude that the simplest models of relativistic beaming fail to explain the `` present observations '' ; and that only if the intrinsic spectrum is curved ( i.e. , with the spectral index increasing with frequency ) , such that the approaching lobe is seen at a significant lower frequency , will asymmetry of the right sense be produced .",
    "this somewhat supports the findings presented here , that asymmetry in the jet and counter jet is intrinsic to the energy source , suggesting that , relativistic beaming may just serve as an important enhancement mechanism .",
    "further , recent observations of so - called microquasars in our galaxy show some asymmetry in the jet and counter jet distributions [ 13 ] ; and not all of the observed asymmetry can be explained by relativistic beaming , suggesting that some asymmetry is intrinsic [ 14 ] .",
    "the remaining structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , i present general formalisms and descriptions of the kerr metric , particle orbits , the penrose compton scattering ( pcs ) , the penrose @xmath11-ray@xmath11-ray pair production [ ppp ( @xmath16 ) ] , and the gravitomagnetic field ( gm ) .",
    "presented in section  [ sec:3 ] is a discussion of the gravitomagnetic field as it relates specifically to pcs and ppp ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:4 ] , i conclude with an overview , including general discussions of how well these model results agree with astronomical observations , and the role of an external accretion disk magnetic field . also , suggestions are made for further investigations .",
    "for completeness , review , and to be referred to in the following sections , the spacetime separation between events near the kbh is defined by the kerr metric [ 15 ] .",
    "the kerr metric written in boyer - lindquist coordinates [ 16 ] and in geometrical units ( @xmath17 ) is @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 is the angular momentum per unit mass parameter , @xmath22 is the mass of the black hole , and @xmath23 gives the frame dragging velocity .",
    "the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined by @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively . in general",
    ", the parameter @xmath21 can have values @xmath28 , values which allow for the existence of an event horizon . for a kbh",
    ", the event horizon is located at @xmath29 , the larger root of the equation @xmath30 . here , in these penrose processes ,",
    "a canonical kbh is used , with its limiting value @xmath31 , as defined in [ 17 ] , in the investigation of an accretion disk around a kbh .",
    "it is found that , if @xmath32 is initially very close to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , a small amount of accretion ( @xmath35 ) through a disk quickly spins the hole down to a limiting state @xmath36 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath32 is initially below this limiting value , accretion spins the hole up toward it .    upon approaching a kbh from infinity , a limit is reached where the angular momentum of the kbh causes inertial frames to be dragged around in the direction that the black hole rotates .",
    "this limit is characterized by the vanishing of the @xmath37 component in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) : @xmath38 more precisely , this limit is the larger root of @xmath37 , given analytically by @xmath39 the region between this limit and the event horizon is called the ergosphere .    inside the ergosphere , the kerr metric in the boyer - lindquist coordinate frame ( blf ) ,",
    "i.e. , frame of the observer at infinity , does not allow an observer to be stationary ( in the sense of the observer being at rest with @xmath40 ) because of the dragging of inertial frames .",
    "for this reason , physical processes are difficult to describe in the blf . in order to examine physical processes inside the ergosphere , bardeen , press , and teukolsky [ 7 ] devised a frame of reference called the local nonrotating frame ( lnrf ) .",
    "observers in this frame rotate with the kbh in such a way that the frame dragging effect of the rotating black hole is canceled as much as possible . in the lnrf ,",
    "special relativity applies since locally spacetime has lorentz geometry .",

    "the high energy range for @xmath126 is chosen based on physical processes found to occur in the two - temperature bistable thin disk / ion corona accretion flow .",
    "more recently such type ion corona accretion flows have been called advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) .",
    "adafs were predicted in lightman s speculation of what might take place as a result of thermal and density instabilities [ 22 ] .",
    "these instabilities can cause the thin disk to form high and low density rings in the inner region and an increase in temperature from @xmath129  k to @xmath130  k [ 8,20,21,22 ] .",
    "astrophysicists over the years , since lightman s time - dependent disk model calculation of the early 1970s [ 22 ] , and subsequent models [ 8,20 ] , have continued to find properties of adafs [ 23 ] .",
    "the most important is the proton - proton collisions in which neutral pions @xmath131 are emitted [ 8,20,23 ] .",
    "the neutral pion @xmath131 subsequently decays into two energetic @xmath11-rays with energies up to @xmath132  mev if the protons are assumed to have a blackbody distribution , or higher for an assumed power - law distribution [ 23 ] .",
    "such photons could populate the photon orbit as follows .",
    "these infalling photons would be blueshifted in energy - momentum at the photon orbit by a factor @xmath133 ( due to the rotating black hole producing the lense - thirring effect ) , where @xmath134 is the so - called blueshift factor given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) [ cf .",
    "( 2.8d ) of [ 5 ] ] .",
    "this means that high energies up to @xmath135  gev ( or higher ) can possibly exist in the ergosphere at or near the photon orbit .",
    "however , it requires a process , such as the penrose mechanism , to inject these highly blueshifted _ trapped _ orbiting photons into escaping orbits [ 7]in this ppp ( @xmath13 ) , they escape in the form of energetic @xmath3 pairs .",
    "now , it is well known that for rotating black holes with @xmath82 , the accretion disk extends inward to @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) , inside of the radius of the ergosphere ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "so , the @xmath11  rays produced in eilek s hot accretion disk model [ 8,20 ] , from the decay of neutral pions @xmath139 , described in details in [ 5 ] , with energies peaked around @xmath140  mev , could very well be seed photons for these @xmath13 reactions , photons that have become blueshifted and bound at the photon orbit [ 24 ] .",
    "in addition , the pcs processes of [ 5 ] show that some of the scattered photons can also be seed particles for these reactions . further , these photon collisions can occur at other radii besides the photon orbit , at , say another turning point , thereby increasing the probability of a collision .",
    "again , it is important to point out that once the photons have been blueshifted to energies given by @xmath126 , and become bound at the photon orbit , they have no other way of escaping , except by some perturbing physical interaction , such as these ppp ( @xmath13 ) processes .",
    "note that , in [ 5 ] , these ppp ( @xmath141 ) processes are defined as @xmath142-penrose processes since they are somewhat different from classical penrose processes  which utilize the retrograde orbits of particles in the ergosphere .    before proceeding ,",
    "i want to discuss the assumptions made above and their validities .",
    "first , it is assumed that the blueshift in the energy of an infalling orbiting photon as measured by a lnrf observer is approximately equal to that measured by a blf observer .",
    "this is a valid assumption because , for a photon in a circular bound orbit about the kbh , there is little difference between the energy measured locally in the lnrf [ eq .  ( 2.8d ) of [ 5 ] ] and that measured by an observer at infinity ( i.e. , in the blf ) [ eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) ] ; for example , at the photon orbit @xmath60 , the ratio of the energy measured by an observer in the lnrf , @xmath143 , to that measured by an observer in blf , @xmath144 , is @xmath145 .",
    "second , it is assumed that the photons populating the photon orbit have been created by some prior processes ( disk instability and/or penrose ) , which yielded them with appropriate energies and momenta . we know from [ 5 ] that the condition @xmath146 guarantees the existence of a turning point outside the event horizon for which the radial motion goes to zero and changes direction for photons emitted not confined to the equatorial plane [ i.e. , @xmath147 .",
    "the asterisks indicate the nonequatorially confined circular photon orbit , where @xmath148 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:23 ] ) ] , which is a potential turning point , and the primes indicate a photon resulting from some prior process , say pcs .",
    "once the condition above has been met , indicating the existence of a turning point outside the horizon , to find out whether or not the photon orbit is a true turning point , for a particular photon , it seems plausible to set @xmath149 , in the the condition above , and let @xmath150 , as the photon spirals inward toward the photon orbit , obtaining the requirement that @xmath151 for the existence of a turning point at @xmath148 [ where @xmath134 is the gravitational blueshift factor , again , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , due to the local blf orbital energy gain ; cf .",
    "also eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ] .",
    "after the photon has reached its turning point , it seems reasonable that it escapes outward with `` redshifted '' energy given by @xmath152 as measured by an observer at infinity , i.e. , in the blf .",
    "although at this point we do not know the exact detailed path of the photon to and from its turning point , but , we can theorize that it looses its acquired inspiraling local orbital energy on its way back outward , before escaping to infinity , as indicated in the above relationship between @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "further , notice that the condition above is independent of @xmath155 .",
    "the other condition that independently guarantees the existence of a turning point in @xmath156 , however , for photons confined to escape along the equatorial plane , as well as for those escaping not confined to the equatorial plane , involves @xmath155 ; see [ 5 ] for details and a complete description of the escape conditions . in [ 5 ] , it is found that many of the pcs photons have appropriate @xmath157 and @xmath158 values to populate the turning point trajectories at or near the photon orbit [ cf .",
    "figs . 3 and  4 to  fig .",
    "1(a ) ] . because of this , it is not unreasonable to expect the photons produced by the @xmath159 decays ( discussed above ) to acquire appropriate @xmath157 and @xmath158 values , particularly , if the process , starting from the proton - proton scattering , is properly considered as a penrose process inside the ergosphere .",
    "note , the radii of other turning points can be found from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) and  ( [ eq:14 ] ) , by satisfying the condition @xmath160 , for the specified `` iso - q '' value orbit ( @xmath161circular orbit of equal @xmath47 ) , where now the radius of the turning point can exist anywhere near the event horizon , say between @xmath162 for the inward pcs photons .",
    "this means that such photons satisfying a condition for the existence of a turning point can have energies at these turning points corresponding to blueshift factors in the range of @xmath163 .",
    "the largest factors , however , will be for photons nearest the photon orbit . in these calculations , the investigation centers around those photons with turning points at the photon orbit where the highest energy can be extracted . yet",
    ", consideration of all of the possible turning points will increase the probability of a ppp ( @xmath13 ) process occurring , as mentioned earlier , giving rise to a larger volume of @xmath3 pairs .",
    "moreover , no null geodesic has more than one turning point in its radial motion outside the event horizon . in general",
    ", a bound orbit at constant radius is considered as an orbit with a `` perpetual '' turning point .",
    "the bound unstable orbit of the photon at constant radius ( the _ photon orbit _ ) may be considered as an orbit on the verge of having a perpetual turning point .",
    "in addition , before proceeding , one way to described particles trajectories in the ergosphere is the following : as a particle travels with @xmath164 or @xmath165 to , say @xmath166 , all local inertial frames as measured by an observer at infinity , i.e. , in the blf , are dragged into rotation by the kbh , irrespective of the four - momentum of the particle as it moves relative to local or neighboring inertial frames .",

    "being significant : the first term gives the high energy ppp electrons a boost into opposite polar directions [ cf .",
    "1(a ) ] ; the second term acting in dominance on the incident infalling photons after the ppp electrons satisfy the condition @xmath432 , provides the asymmetry , favoring the positive @xmath277 direction .",
    "overall , in these ppp ( @xmath13 ) processes , we find that the intrinsic `` @xmath3 jet '' ( positive @xmath397 direction ) to counter jet ( negative @xmath397 direction ) asymmetry ( defined by @xmath433 ) increases , first quickly , as above ( cf . fig .  8) , then slowly , to a ratio of @xmath434 , for the maximum energy that can be used for the target photon in these processes , @xmath435  gev ( i.e. , before the computer simulation breaks down ; see [ 5 ] for detailed construction of computer codes ) .",
    "astrophysically , what this means is that as @xmath126 is increased , implying increasing the energy - momentum of the escaping ppp electrons , the luminosities in the jet ( @xmath436 ) and counter jet ( @xmath437 ) get more one - sided , mimicking the effects associated with relativistic beaming , until a maximum ratio in luminosity ( @xmath438 ) is reached .",
    "we see this occurring when we let these ppp electrons undergo `` secondary '' pcs with infalling disk photons [ 25 ] , allowing us to obtain @xmath11-ray luminosities .",
    "it is presumed that such a @xmath438 ratio in jet luminosities would also exist in synchrotron radiation if the ppp electrons were allowed to interact with a surrounding magnetic field .",
    "thus , it appears that relativistic beaming near line of sight of the observer , in general , will be needed to explain observations if the observed @xmath439 , in a source powered by a black hole , is greater than @xmath440 for the high energy @xmath11-ray or synchrotron emission .",
    "nevertheless , importantly , these penrose processes acting in conjunction with the gm field can serve the purpose of beaming the escaping particles into the polar direction , probably creating the initial jets of agns . the intrinsic magnetic field produced by the dynamo - like action associated with the swirling ( vortical orbiting [ 26 ] ) escaping penrose produced highly relativistic plasma , about the polar axis , may be important also , at least in the observed synchrotron emission of the jets , and perhaps in maintaining collimation :",
    "this statement must be investigated further .",
    "in addition , when analyzing the gm radial component @xmath441 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:47 ] ) , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq:49 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:40 ] ) , and fig .",
    "2(a ) , to see what effects this component has on the ppp electrons , we get the following . for @xmath3 pairs scattered with @xmath442 , @xmath443 [ cf .",
    "but for @xmath444 , @xmath443 for @xmath445as would be for the higher energy particles ; otherwise @xmath446as would be for the lower energy particles or particles with large @xmath444 .",
    "since in this case , only the ppp electrons with @xmath418 escape ( on the average one of the pairs escapes , while the other falls into the black hole [ 5 ] ) , it is not clear what role the radial component of the gm force plays .",
    "however , looking back at the radial spectra of the pcs photons , this behavior appears to be a contributing factor to the progressive asymmetry of @xmath255 seen in the escaping photons with large @xmath282 after being scattered by equatorially confined target electrons [ cf .",
    "3(a)@xmath1943(e ) and  4(a)@xmath1944(e ) ] ; and the reestablishing the symmetry seen in @xmath255 for the high energy particles [ implying large @xmath270 after being scattered by the nonequatorially confined target electrons [ cf .",
    "3(f)@xmath1943(i ) and  4(f)@xmath1944(i ) ] .",
    "so , overall , for the pcs and the ppp ( @xmath13 ) considered here , in general , the asymmetries seen in the scattered particle distributions , above and below the equatorial plane , that one would , in nonrotating space ( or pseudo flat space ) , expect to be symmetrical , can be attributed to the gm field acting on the incident and scattered particles . specifically , it is a tug - of - war between conditions @xmath447 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:47 ] ) that causes the asymmetry , which varies through a ratio of @xmath448 in the @xmath3 jet to counter jet for ppp ( @xmath13 ) , and a ratio of @xmath449 in the photon jet to counter jet for pcs .",
    "thus , the gm force , more or less , breaks the expected reflection symmetry , above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "these penrose processes , which occur near the event horizon , allow us to see this general relativistic effect in action .",
    "it has been shown in this investigation that penrose scattering processes in the ergosphere of a kbh can produce x - ray , @xmath11-ray , and @xmath3 pair energies comparable to those observed in quasars and other agns .",
    "this model can work for any size accretion disk ( thin or `` thick '' ) and any size black hole .",
    "it has been shown also that the asymmetry in the distribution of penrose scattered particles , above and below the equatorial plane , can be attributed to the gm field  the gravitational force field produced by the angular momentum of the kbh , which causes local inertial frames to be dragged into the direction that the black hole is rotating ( sometimes called the lense - thirring effect ) .",
    "it has become apparent through these penrose processes that the gm force field lines , inside the ergosphere , close to the event horizon , are frame dragged into the positive azimuthal direction in the local frame of the observer at infinity , resulting in particle distributions appearing to break the expected reflection symmetry of the kerr metric ( which describes the geometry outside of a rotating black hole ) above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "overall , these model calculations strongly suggest that the momenta of the penrose scattered particles naturally aid in the production of one - sided and two - sided polar jets , consistent with the jets associated with agns .",
    "moreover , the variations between symmetry and asymmetry found in the scattered particle distributions , and thus in densities , due to the gm field acting on the space momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles , could contribute to the overall individual `` blob - like '' structures we observe in the jets of agns ; this should , however , be investigated further .",
    "importantly , we have the following conclusion from this investigation : the astrophysical conceptual fact is that rapidly rotating black holes give rise to penrose processes and strong gm forces , which in turn produce high energy particle jets with symmetrical and asymmetrical distributions : differing by a factor as high as @xmath450 , above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "this must be taking into account in agn models when applying relativistic beaming effects [ 27,28,29,30 ] .",
    "in addition , this investigation suggests an answer to the long asked question concerning whether or not the asymmetry in the jet and counter jet distributions is intrinsic to the energy source [ 31 ] .",
    "the suggested answer , in general , is yes , although doppler boosting due to relativistic beaming [ 32,33 ] when the emission axis of the jet is near the line of sight of the observer , may still in some cases serve as an important enhancement mechanism , to increase the apparent observed luminosities and energies , particularly when superluminal motion in the jet flow is apparent and/or the jet and counter jet luminosities differ by more than a factor @xmath450 .",
    "details of how these penrose scattering processes relate to agns , their observed luminosities , and relativistic beaming models , are discussed in other papers by the author [ 25,34 ] .",
    "further , the model presented here to extract energy - momentum from a rotating black hole by penrose escaping particles , along with the intrinsic magnetic field associated with this relativistic vortical orbiting escaping `` plasma , '' which is expected to give rise to synchrotron radiation  being consistent with observations , suggests a complete , self - consistent model , without the necessity of the external magnetic field of the accretion disk . the attempted use of the external magnetic field of the accretion disk in a dominant role to extract rotational energy from a black hole , by having the magnetic field lines torque the horizon and/or the accretion material near the horizon ( i.e. , the blandford - znajek ( bz ) type models ; see [ 35 ] and references therein ) , introduces historical problems yet to be solved , namely , how to convert from electromagnetic energy to relativistic particle energy , such that particles are ejected along field lines into the polar direction ; and related problems , such as how to keep the field lines from becoming tangled ( or to be sufficiently tangled ) ; how to generate the large magnetic field strengths needed ( 1 ) if the relativistic particles are to be created along the field lines and ( 2 ) to be consistent with the most luminous agns .",
    "equally the causality problem as related to the `` vacuum infinity '' horizon at which upon nearing , the magnetic flux is redshifted away poses a problem for models assuming the magnetic field lines are `` anchored '' to the horizon or surrounding ergospheric region ; see [ 36 ] .",
    "however , the electromagnetic field of the accretion disk could , perhaps , play an important role on a large scale in assisting the jets of the penrose escaping particles , in further collimation and acceleration , out to the observed kiloparsec distances of agn jets .",
    "the large scale magnetic field of the accretion disk may also be important in transporting angular momentum outward enabling material to be accreted into the black hole [ 37 ] .",
    "now , by the same token , since the gm field provides a way through these penrose processes to transport angular momentum from particles inside the ergosphere , outward to infinity , it too may also provide a way to transport angular momentum outward , in the `` static '' [ 7 ] accretion disk regime ( @xmath451 , i.e. , where the severe frame dragging is less ) : this statement seems worthy of an investigation .    in addition , the penrose process distributions described here , of escaping particles , are consistent with the disk returning photons [ 38 ] , gravitationally focused after being emitted from radii @xmath452 ( @xmath137 ) , the marginally stable orbit .",
    "as measured by an observer at infinity , the pcs photons are reemitted with the highest energy photons scattered along geodesics concentrated in the equatorial plane .",
    "notice , cases similar to those of figs .",

    "3(a ) , 6(a ) , 7(a ) , 7(b ) , which is consistent with mcg6 - 30 - 15 , has model parameters for radial infalling photons ( @xmath467  kev ) from a thin disk , that either undergo pcs by equatorially or nonequatorially confined orbiting target electrons ( @xmath280  mev or @xmath468  mev , respectively ) at @xmath61 or ppp ( @xmath13 ) at @xmath60 : the blueshifted energies ( due to frame dragging ) attained by the @xmath469 up to @xmath470 escaping particles , returning to the disk to be reprocessed and/or escaping to infinity , are the following : for pcs photons , @xmath471  kev or @xmath472  kev for equatorially or nonequatorially confined orbiting target electrons , respectively , with relative photon luminosities @xmath473 or @xmath474 , respectively ; and for the relativistic ppp electrons ( with @xmath475  mev ) , @xmath476  mev [ consistent with synchrotron radiation in the radio regime for @xmath463  gauss , and inverse compton scattering ( of disk photons ) into the hard x - ray / soft @xmath11-ray regime  with relative incoming and outgoing photon luminosities @xmath477 , for @xmath478 , at @xmath479  mev , respectively ] , suggesting relatively weak , less powerful and less prominent radio jets , i.e. , a radio quiet agn , like a seyfert galaxy ; see [ 5,25,34,41 ] for details .",
    "note , @xmath126 is assumed based on prior pcs photons with @xmath281 that satisfy conditions for the existence of a turning point at the photon orbit ( discussed in section  [ sec:2c ] ) , and on satisfaction of the energy threshold for the particles to react ( see [ 5 ] ) .",
    "thus , the consistency of the results of these penrose process analyses with observations strongly suggests that the appropriate way to exact energy from a kbh is by the `` penrose - williams '' mechanism , described here and in [ 5,25,34,41 ] : using gravity as the controlling force  to distinguish it from bz - type models , which use electromagnetism as the controlling force .",
    "lastly , i want to conclude with the comment , that , the physics described in this paper and the associated paper of [ 5 ] , can be applied to different types of high energy - momentum exchange scattering processes , i.e. , processes that would be expected to occur in the `` hot '' ergosphere of a rotating black hole , the intention being to extract rotational energy - momentum . an immediate future investigation would be to perform the proton - proton nuclear scattering of neutral pions @xmath131 , and their subsequent @xmath139 decay ( see [ 5,8,20 ] ) , inside the ergosphere of a kbh .",
    "these @xmath11-rays are presumed to be important in the population of the photon orbit in the highest energy ppp ( @xmath13 ) processes .",
    "note , similar nuclear scattering and @xmath131-decay processes , however , for particles confined to the equatorial plane are investigated in [ 3 ] .",
