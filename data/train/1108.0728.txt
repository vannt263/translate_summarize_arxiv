    "the evolution of collisionless systems poses an interesting challenge in kinetic theory .",
    "indeed , from the lack of a collision term in the kinetic equation ruling the evolution of the system arises the need for another relaxation mechanism .",
    "unusual relaxation properties are found in many physical systems among which self - gravitating systems , non - neutral plasmas and wave - particle interactions for instance .",
    "these systems fall into the categories of long - range interacting systems , a domain of physics that is the object of renewed interest  @xcite .",
    "one phenomenon in particular has been evidenced numerically @xcite and theoretically @xcite  : in systems with long - range interactions , increasing the number of particles @xmath0 causes the system to evolve , with a time scale of order @xmath1 , towards an intermediate state that is not the one predicted by statistical mechanics and whose lifetime increases as @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "these states are called quasi - stationary states ( qss ) and are equilibria of the continuum limit given by the vlasov equation  @xcite .",
    "qss have been observed in the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model @xcite , the free - electron laser @xcite and also in self - gravitating systems @xcite .",
    "experimental perspectives regarding these qss have recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "the fast evolution on a timescale @xmath1 is termed violent relaxation , following the terminology of the studies on 1d self - gravitating systems .",
    "early works report that the evolution towards a stationary regime is not driven by two - body encounters and question the nature of the initial evolution of gravitating systems  @xcite . in light of these observations , lynden - bell presented in 1967 his _ statistical mechanics of violent relaxation in stellar systems _",
    "the aim of his theory is to explain the outcome of collisionless dynamics and the unusual energy distribution found in galactic dynamics .",
    "lynden - bell s ( lb ) theory is a statistical theory that takes into account , among other properties of the vlasov equation , its incompressible character in the single - particle phase space ; accordingly , an ergodic - type hypothesis on the dynamics allows one to compute , via an entropy maximization , stationary states of the vlasov equation .",
    "lb s theory predicts the magnetization in the hmf model and provides the most likely qss solution for this model , as of now @xcite .",
    "the work of lynden - bell has been followed by numerous numerical studies on violent relaxation , see refs .",
    "@xcite for instance .",
    "lb s theory or other attempts to compute the outcome of violent relaxation can be found in more recent work on the self - gravitating sheet model @xcite , non - neutral plasmas @xcite and 2d self - gravitating systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , new macroscopic observables have been proposed to measure the approach to equilibrium in the self - gravitating sheet model  @xcite .",
    "an extensive study by the same authors indicate the physical situations in which lb s theory provides a good prediction and the reasons it does not work in other situations  @xcite .",
    "let us also mention the use of the vlasov equation in the field of plasma physics  @xcite that is probably the widest area of research making use of it .",
    "the understanding of collisionless relaxation is also of great interest in this field and is mostly known for the famous problem of landau damping ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for instance ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to demonstrate via direct numerical simulation of the vlasov equation that stretching and folding structures occur in some regions of phase space .",
    "a measure of the consequent deformation of the fluid allows us to characterize the short - time evolution in the vlasov equation .",
    "we choose to take as the main vehicle of our study , the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model @xcite , a system of globally coupled rotators moving on a circle .",
    "the hmf model has been the object of many studies as a paradigmatic representative of long - range interacting systems and the properties of its associated vlasov dynamics are well - known .",
    "in addition , in the spirit of demonstrating fundamental dynamical properties , the similarity of the hmf model with the forced pendulum makes it a worthwhile example , as evidenced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "besides , we also consider discrete - time versions of vlasov dynamics , in which the phase - space distribution function evolves under the effect of an area - preserving map .",
    "two such mean - field maps are investigated , which are based on arnold s cat map @xcite and the standard map @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "in section  [ sec : hmf ] , we introduce the hamiltonian mean - field model , its associated vlasov equation and the phenomenology of qss .",
    "section  [ sec : perim ] presents the numerical algorithm and the computation of the perimeter that is used to substantiate quantitatively our claims .",
    "section  [ sec : stretch ] gives the results of vlasov simulations , in which stretching and folding occur in phase space . in section  [ sec : mfm ] , mean - field maps are studied in order to determine the conditions of stretching of fluid boundaries in phase space .",
    "the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model was introduced as a simplified model to study collective effects and has become a paradigmatic model to study long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "it is composed of particles on a circle interacting via a cosine potential and described by the following hamiltonian  : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the position in the interval @xmath6 of the @xmath7th particle , @xmath8 its momentum and @xmath0 is the number of particles . at equilibrium ,",
    "the hmf model is characterized by a second - order phase transition , identified by the magnetization  : @xmath9 @xmath10 is equal to zero above the critical energy @xmath11 , while @xmath12 for energies below @xmath13 .",
    "starting from an out - of - equilibrium initial condition , the hmf model displays interesting dynamical phenomena  : in addition to the energy , the initial value of @xmath14 influences the regimes attained by the system @xcite , a dependence which is not found at equilibrium .",
    "the value that @xmath14 reaches is not the one corresponding to equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "this phenomenon lasts for a time lapse that depends on the number @xmath0 of particles considered as @xmath15 after which the system eventually relaxes to equilibrium . this intermediate regime",
    "is called a qss  @xcite .",
    "let us now introduce the vlasov equation describing the evolution of the distribution function @xmath16 in the hmf model and valid in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite  : @xmath17}{d\\theta } \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p } = 0\\ ; , \\cr      & & \\cr    v[f](\\theta ) & = & 1 - m_x[f ] \\cos\\theta - m_y[f ] \\sin\\theta\\ ; , \\cr    m_x[f ] & = & \\int d\\theta\\ , dp\\ , f \\cos\\theta \\ ; , \\cr    m_y[f ] & = & \\int d\\theta\\ , dp\\ , f \\sin\\theta\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the periodic spatial coordinate , @xmath19 is the momentum , @xmath20 is the potential , depending self - consistently on @xmath21 .",

    "the semi - lagrangian method displays a relatively small amount of numerical dissipation and thus fits adequately the purpose of computing the perimeter of the fluid .",
    "lynden - bell s ( lb ) theory has proven so far successful for the hmf model @xcite , the free electron laser @xcite and partly for the self - gravitating sheet model @xcite . the effectiveness of lynden - bell s theory to describe the hmf model has been an important confirmation of the adequateness of the vlasov equation to understand qsss .    it has been recently shown that lynden - bell s theory captures fundamental properties of the vlasov dynamics and that phase space _ stirring _ already provides a fair amount of evolution .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtain good comparison between lynden - bell s theory and a model with no interaction at all between particles .",
    "the same authors propose an exact solution to the mean - field equilibria in the vlasov equation , fully demonstrating how stirring allows the dynamics to reach steady states in vlasov dynamics  @xcite .",
    "stirring is however insufficient to obtain the better agreement found in the hmf model when using lb s theory . to complete the dynamical picture ,",
    "another relaxation mechanism is needed .",
    "in the context of 2d fluid dynamics , experimental results can be obtained by direct visual inspection . in the kinetic context , the distribution function ( df ) lies in phase space @xmath26 .",
    "the technique that we propose is reminiscent of methods used in fluid dynamics . to analyze the complex behavior of the df , we track its boundary in the same way as tracking a dyed region in a fluid . instead of a dye",

    ", it is easy to compute the time evolution of @xmath30  : @xmath34 which is seen to be asymptotically linear in time .",
    "this linear behavior is expected to hold in the case of regular dynamics , as in the case of integrable systems .    in more complex situations ,",
    "we expect a deformation of the contour of the fluid , similar to what happens in fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed , 2d flows submitted to parametric forcing exhibit chaotic behavior , and analogies between vlasov dynamics and 2d euler equations are common @xcite .",
    "if neighboring fluid elements experience an exponential separation of their positions , we expect that the perimeter is dominated by this contribution so that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a positive real number . after the stretching mechanism has taken place , the fluid folds onto itself to accommodate for the increasing perimeter at fixed area . in fluid dynamics , the obtention of an optimal mixing , via stretching and folding of the fluid , is a ongoing topic of interest @xcite .",
    "the perimeter is computed numerically with the help of the routine conrec  @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , the concept of lyapunov exponent characterizing chaotic dynamics is useful to interpret the present stretching rate . in fig.[fig : mixf_perim ] , the early exponential increases observed for @xmath30 can be understood in terms of the phase - space dynamics of the pendulum periodically driven by the large early oscillations of the mean field seen in fig.[fig : mixf_m(t ) ] .",

    "measuring the degree of mixing in kinetic theory is undoubtedly a considerable challenge .",
    "however , in order to assess the evolution of a given system , a quantitative tool must be chosen .",
    "an analogy with fluid mechanics allowed us to consider the use of the perimeter of the fluid in phase space , viewed as a dyed region .",
    "in both the hamiltonian mean - field model and the mean - field cat and standard maps , our numerical experiments report an exponential growth of the perimeter , sign that exponential stretching occurs at least locally on the contour of the fluid .",

    "the existence of an infinite number of conserved quantities in the vlasov equation forbids the increase of entropic functionals , which implies that coarse graining is needed in order to describe the evolution towards stationary states ( ss ) or quasi - stationary states ( qss ) . in the light of our findings about the mechanism leading to such qss , violent relaxation can be understood from a pure vlasovian picture in which the deformation of the initial condition allows the system to reach a qss .",
    "this deformation takes place at constant phase - space volume but with a perimeter that increases exponentially during some lapses of the time evolution . the increase in the perimeter",
    "is made possible through successive stretching and folding the fluid .",

    "the understanding of phenomena related to violent relaxation , for instance the separation of phase space in different regions  @xcite that leads to the formation of a core and a halo are coherent with the results of the present article . applying our method to more common systems , such as the self - gravitating sheet model ,",
    "is expected to reveal a similar behavior and would prove interesting to complete the existing body of literature .    from our numerical observations",

    "the presence of self - consistent resonances may organize phase space in a way that prevents the statistical prediction of stationary regimes .",
    "indeed , these resonances imply that the energy distribution function is non monotonous , in contrast to the predictions of lynden - bell s theory or boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium . the self - consistent resonances are often at the origin of the so - called `` dynamical effects '' that prevent a system to reach a qss or thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "finally , let us recall that , in the perspective given in the present paper , the phase - space exponential separation leading to mixing has similarities to what happens in chaotic dynamics although notable differences exist such that the dependence on the initial distribution function as well as the time dependence of the stretching rate .",
    "a possible way to tighten both aspects is to use test particles that feel the time - dependent magnetization generated by a vlasov simulation .",
    "it is possible to push this method further by the use of a poincar map on these test particles , providing one with the tools of iterative mapping , which are of common use in nonlinear dynamics .",
