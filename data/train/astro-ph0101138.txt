    "high energy radiation from various classes of galactic and extragalactic objects has been observed for nearly 30 years . large fraction of the galactic sources are associated with neutron stars : rotation powered pulsars ( rpp ) , accretion powered pulsars ( app ) , cooling neutron stars , and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) .",
    "rotation powered pulsars like crab , vela and geminga have a long history of successful observations with baloon - born and satellite gamma - ray and x - ray experiments .",
    "performance of old experiments had been , however , surpassed in terms of sensitivity , energy range , number of positive detections , or photon statistics per object by the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) and r \" ontgen satellit ( rosat ) .",
    "spectacular results of observational campaigns of rpp with rosat and cgro induced a new wave of interest in theoretical aspects of pulsar magnetospheric activity .",
    "pair creation paradigm is a pivotal element in any model of magnetospheric activity of rpp .",
    "electron - positron pairs ( @xmath0-pairs ) are necessary since they are thought to be responsible for radio emission observed in radiopulsars and interpreted as the coherent curvature radiation of @xmath0 plasma .",
    "pairs can be produced in magnetospheric environments either via photon absorption in a dense field of soft photons ( photon - photon collision ) or via photon absorption in a strong magnetic field . in either case a supply of high - energy ( he ) photons is required in order to fulfill stringent threshold conditions for the pair creation .",
    "it it quite reasonable then to assume that not all of those he - photons would be subject to absorption . on the contrary",
    ", many he photons will escape the magnetosphere without any attenuation .",
    "this argument leads us to expect that rpp ( and all radiopulsars in particular ) should be the sources of he radiation . to make the production of he photons possible ,",
    "highly relativistic charged particles are to be injected into the magnetosphere .",
    "one may speculate that some of these particles will either retain their energy or regain it ( under circumstances to be specified ) upon escaping from the source .",
    "it is up to theoretical models of the rpp activity to show whether a rate of he radiation and/or particles is interestingly high with respect to the sensitivity of recent and future he detectors and telescopes .",
    "this review focuses on rpp as sources of he photons , presenting the most important observational results as well as their interpretation in terms of basic processes expected in the magnetospheres of rpp .",
    "the interpretation is offered by referring to a particular class of models of magnetospheric activity , known as polar gap models ( or polar cap models ) .",
    "the name reflects the association of accelerator ( the gap ) with a polar cap on neutron star ( ns ) surface .",
    "contrary to polar gap models , outer gap models @xcite postulate the existence of accelerators located in regions where local corotation charge density reaches zero , close to the light cylinder .",
    "the @xmath0pair creation occurs there either via one photon magnetic absorption ( crab - type outer gaps ) or via photon - photon collisions ( vela type outer gaps ) .",
    "these models are relevant for both classical and millisecond pulsars with sufficiently high spin - down luminosity @xmath1 .",
    "the outer - gap accelerators cease to produce @xmath0 pairs once the pulsar crosses the death - line @xmath2 @xcite . a modern version of the outer - gap accelerator , the so called ` thick gap solution ' @xcite , is however able to accommodate pulsars of longer spin periods , like geminga and b1055 - 52 , removing at the same time serious problems with the original model of @xcite . a detailed review of outer gap models in the context of he radiation is available @xcite and",
    "therefore we ll concentrate on polar gap models .",
    "the review is organised in the following way : sect.2 defines basic quantities and introduces the assumptions used in pulsar physics . the status of x - ray and gamma - ray observations of rpp and essential features of the radiation detected from several sources are presented in sect.3 .",
    "sect.4 offers simple estimates of how effective a unipolar inductor ( i.e. accelerator ) can be when acting in the framework of a neutron star .",
    "sect.5 discusses vertical structure of some polar gap accelerators .",
    "sect.6 presents the properties of most important radiative processes induced by such inductors inside the rpp magnetosphere . with energetic arguments formulated in sect.4 ,",
    "sect.7 addresses a question of whether newly born and fastly spinning rpp might lead to generation of ultrarelativistic charged particles responsible then for the uhecr events observed above the gzk limit .",
    "sect.8 emphasizes the anticipated role of high sensitivity he / vhe missions of the near future in contributing to the physics of rpp .",
    "the aim of this section is to define basic quantities used throughout the review and to introduce their mutual relations .",
    "several excellent monographs covering this subject in a detailed and sophisticated way are available e.g. @xcite with a critical discussion .",
    "the starting point are two major quantities measured for pulsars  period @xmath3 , interpreted as a period of rotation of a neutron star , and @xmath4 , its time derivative .",
    "suppose , that a neutron star of radius @xmath5 and moment of inertia @xmath6 rotates with angular velocity @xmath7 which decreases in time ( for whatever reason ) at a rate @xmath8 . the rotational energy and its time derivative then read @xmath9 where @xmath3 is in seconds , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "instead of @xmath12 one uses the so called spin - down luminosity @xmath1 defined as @xmath13 the name _",
    "luminosity _ is misleading since the carriers of the major part of @xmath12 are not luminous for us : no one has ever managed to `` see '' them in a direct way by any type of detector ( but see sect.7 ) and their nature is model - dependent , at least for the time being . therefore we need a model for the spin - down of a neutron star .",
    "let us assume that a magnetic dipole is attached to the center of a neutron star , with its moment inclined at angle @xmath14 to the spin axis @xmath15 , and let the mean strength of the field at the stellar surface is @xmath16 .",
    "the magnetic dipole , rotating in a vacuum will emit energy at the rate @xmath17 suggesting thus the following model of the neutron star spin - down : @xmath18 the quantity @xmath19 can be inferred from @xmath3 and @xmath4 for a neutron star with known values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 . for a large number of randomly oriented rotators the factor",
    "@xmath20 can be replaced with its averaged value of @xmath21 .",
    "another model , where the dipolar radiation is replaced with a magnetospheric wind of particles @xcite , gives similar result as ( [ b3 ] ) for an orthogonal rotator : @xmath22 and therefore is independent of the angle @xmath14 .",
    "since there exists no observational support for @xmath4 depending on @xmath23 the standard approach is to apply the latter model to derive the strength of dipolar component of the magnetic field @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .    assuming that @xmath16 does not change with time one can integrate ( [ b6 ] ) to obtain the characteristic spin - down time scale @xmath27  a period of time elapsed since the pulsar was born with initial period @xmath28 @xmath29 \\s.\\ ] ] as long as @xmath30 , which is thought to be satisfied for all classical pulsars and most of millisecond pulsars , the last factor in ( [ b7 ] ) plays no role and thus @xmath31 .",
    "it is likely that neutron star magnetic fields contain high - order multipoles which may dominate the dipolar component at the surface level .",
    "their relative amplitudes as well as distribution remain , however , unknown .",
    "it will be assumed throughout the paper that the dipolar magnetic field is not distorted by rotational effects or presence of strong outflowing wind of particles ( the latter effect has been recently invoked to decrease very high values of @xmath16 inferred from @xmath3 and @xmath4 for two sgrs @xcite ; in consequence , their classification as magnetars became questionable ) .",
    "the field is therefore approximated with axisymmetric static dipole with field lines satisfying @xmath32 in polar coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with the dipole constant @xmath35 .",
    "the dipole constant at which rigid rotation reaches speed - of - light limit is called the light cylinder : @xmath36 . all field lines which cross the light cylinder",
    "are then considered as open lines , and their footpoints on the stellar surface define two polar caps of radius @xmath37 , where the latter factor is the sine function of the polar coordinate @xmath34 for the outer rim of the polar cap : @xmath38 .",
    "_ a  posteriori _ evidence that high - energy activity of pulsars must somehow draw from their rotational energy @xmath39 comes from a simple finding that , essentially , the success of detection of a particular pulsar in x - rays and/or gamma - rays was strongly correlated with its position in the lists of targets ranked by spin - down flux values @xmath40 .",

    "a remarkable fact is that the location of x - ray sources does not correlate with the inferred strength of magnetic field @xmath16 ; at least not in a naively anticipated way that high - b objects would emit he radiation , whereas low - b objects would not . in particular , 10 millisecond pulsars  about thirty percent of all millisecond pulsars ( the objects with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , i.e. with low b values : @xmath51 ) known to date  have been detected as x - ray sources .",

    "several predictions have been presented which would hopefully discriminate between those models .",
    "it will be impossible , however , to verify those predictions without achieving higher sensitivities and exploring new energy domains .    a break - through in understanding rotation powered pulsars and their plerionic environments",
    "should then come from he / vhe astronomy of the near future , with its planned satellite and ground - based experiments .",
    "expected sensitivity and energy range for some of them is presented in fig.[j0437 ] along with a predicted flux from a nearby millisecond pulsar , overlaid for the sake of comparison .",
    "the satellite experiment glast @xcite will be superior to its predecessor  egret on board cgro  in two aspects .",
    "first , its sensitivity at 10  gev will be three orders of magnitude better than that of egret .",
    "second , it will reach energy of 300  gev , closing thus for the first time a wide gap in energy between ground - based and satelite experiments .",
    "the magic telescope @xcite  a 17 m diameter imaging air cherenkov telescope ( iact )  is expected to operate with sensitivity about three orders of magnitude higher at 10  gev than egret .",
    "its advanced technology will make possible to cover energy range between 10  gev and 1  tev , and to reach @xmath335tev in the large zenith angle mode .",
    "energy ranges of glast and magic will overlap over more than one decade in energy .",
    "another proposed iact , veritas @xcite , will be an array of seven 10  m telescopes , covering energy range from 50  gev to 50  tev with planned sensitivity at 1  tev about ten times better than magic .",

    "<S> highly magnetised rapidly spinning neutron stars are widely considered to be natural sites for acceleration of charged particles . </S>",
    "<S> powerful acceleration mechanism due to unipolar induction is thought to operate in the magnetospheres of isolated neutron stars , bringing the particles to ultrarelativistic energies at the expense of the neutron star rotational energy , with inevitable emission of high energy photons.the aim of this review is to present basic ingredients of modern models of magnetospheric activity of rotation powered pulsars in the context of high - energy radiation from these objects . </S>",
    "<S> several aspects of pulsar activity are addressed and related to spectacular results of pulsar observations with two major satellite missions of the past  cgro and rosat . </S>",
    "<S> it is then argued that high sensitivity experiments of the future - glast , veritas and magic - will be vital for a progress in our understanding of pulsar magnetospheric processes.in a conservative approach rotation powered pulsars are not expected to be the sources of uhe cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> however , several scenarios have been proposed recently to explain the uhecr events above the gzk limit with the help of acceleration processes in the immediate surrounding of newly born pulsars . </S>",
