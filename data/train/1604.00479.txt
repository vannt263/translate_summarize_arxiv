    "our device consists of self - assembled inas / gaas quantum dots embedded in a micropillar fabry - perot cavity grown by molecular beam epitaxy @xcite . the qd layer is embedded in a p - i - n junction , which enables tuning of the qd resonance frequency by the quantum confined stark effect . for transverse mode confinement and to achieve polarization degenerate cavity modes , we first ion - etch micropillars of large diameter ( 35  m ) and slightly elliptical shape , then we use wet - chemical oxidation of an alas layer @xcite to prepare an intra - cavity lens for transverse - mode confinement @xcite , avoiding loss by surface scattering at the side walls . finally , we fine - tune the cavity modes by laser induced surface defects @xcite to obtain routinely a polarization mode splitting much less than 10% of the cavity linewidth .",

    "the excitonic fine structure splitting leads to @xmath15  ghz splitting between the orthogonally polarized qd transitions at 0@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and 90@xmath16 ( @xmath18 ) . to determine further system parameters , we model our qd - cavity system by a two - polarization jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian coupled to the incident coherent field , and take care of cavity and qd dissipation by the quantum master equation formalism @xcite . we compare experiment and theory for 6 different input - output polarizer settings to faithfully determine the model parameters @xcite .",

    "now we perform photon correlation measurements ; instead of tuning the laser , we now tune the qd . because the cavity linewidth is large compared to the qd tuning range , a parameter space similar to that before is explored .",
    "experimentally , using an external electric field to tune the qd via the quantum confined stark effect is much more robust than laser frequency tuning . fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 - 2d ] shows the false - color map of @xmath4 as function of output polarization @xmath13 and qd detuning .",
    "we see clearly that the enhanced bunching occurs under the special polarization condition in the low - transmittivity regions indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xpolmagic2d ] .",

    "[ fig : g2 - 2d]b ) shows a maximal photon bunching of @xmath34 .",
    "compared to this , the experimentally observed photon correlations are less ( maximally @xmath48 ) , but if we convolute the theoretical results with the detector response function , very good agreement is obtained ( see supplemental information @xcite ) .",
    "one also notices that the regions of high photon bunching exhibit hyperbolic shape , which is due to modification of the interference between the cavity and qd resonances while scanning the qd .    experimental ( a ) and theoretical ( b ) data of the second - order correlation function as a function of the qd frequency and output polarization ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "green dashed lines indicate the special polarization angles , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 indicate the highest and lowest experimental @xmath4 values , respectively . ]",
    "we have shown by experiment and theory that the reduced fidelity of a qd nonlinearity , caused by imperfect qd - cavity coupling , can be strongly enhanced by pre- and post - selection of specific polarization states .",
    "this enables transformation of a weak coherent input beam into highly bunched light with @xmath51 , a value that has not been reached before , not even in the strong coupling regime . to gain more insight , understanding in terms of the photon number distribution @xmath52",
    "is required , for which we use our theoretical model as direct experimental determination of @xmath52 is strongly complicated by its sensitivity to loss .",
    "but also the simulation of narrow - band photon number fock input states is challenging in the quantum master model @xcite .",
    "we continue here using coherent input light , and analyze the intra - cavity light in terms of its photon number distribution , however , taking full care of quantum interference at the postselection polarizer .",
    "this polarizer leads to hong - ou - mandel type photon bunching similar to the case of a quantum beamsplitter , where the two polarization modes take over the role of the two input ports .",
    "we found that the photon statistics @xmath52 can be calculated best by projection on the required fock states using polarization - rotated fock space ladder operators @xmath53 , and tracing out the undesired polarization component afterwards .",
    "for the numerically @xcite calculated photonic density matrix operator @xmath54 of our system , the photon number distribution after the polarizer becomes :    @xmath55     calculated photon number distribution after the polarizer , with ( through curves ) and without ( dashed curves ) coupling to the quantum dot in the cavity , the laser frequency is set to one of the qd resonances . with qd , we clearly see the photon - number dependent shift of the transmission dip .",
    "only the photon number distribution of the detected polarization component is shown , therefore the total number of photons in case with quantum dot can exceed the case without quantum dot due to polarization conversion by the dot .",
    "for clarity , pure dephasing has been neglected here , making the special polarization angle different from the previous simulations and experimental results . ]",
    "[ fig : pns ] shows the 4 lowest photon number probabilities as a function of the polarizer angle @xmath13 , for the case with and without quantum dot . in the bare cavity case",
    "we see , as expected , lowest transmission under the cross - polarization condition ( @xmath56 ) . for the case with the qd",
    ", we observe a photon - number dependent shift of the transmission dip . at the special polarization angle @xmath3",
    ", we see that the one - photon component reaches a minimum while the higher - photon number states do not . since @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the photon correlations diverge like @xmath60 if the single - photon component is attenuated as @xmath61 , explaining the enhanced photon bunching enabled by the purification technique .",
    "it is important to note that also the two - photon transmission dip ( @xmath62 ) is not exactly at cross - polarization , which suggests the following intuitive explanation : apparently , in the photon number basis , the different fock states pick up a different phase during transmission through the qd - cavity system . in the weak coupling regime , but often also in the strong coupling regime , the individual jaynes cummings dressed states can not be resolved spectrally because @xmath63 .",
    "however , the cqed system is still photon - number sensitive , which implies lifetime - dependent jaynes cummings effects in the weak coupling regime : the decay rate of the cqed system increases with the number of photons in the cavity @xcite . as consequence ,",
    "higher photon - number states have a modified interaction cross section and experience a reduced phase shift .",
    "the dip in @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pns ] is already very close to the cross - polarization angle @xmath64 , while the dips for higher photon number states @xmath65 is indistinguishable from @xmath64 .",
    "we add that , while single fock states have an undefined phase , superpositions of different fock states , such as in different polarization modes have a well defined relative phase .",
    "this is also the basis of a recent observation of quadrature squeezing in the resonance fluorescence of a single quantum dot @xcite , where orthogonal polarizations have been used to obtain a phase - stable local oscillator .",
    "we have calculated the amount of quadrature squeezing of the transmitted light in our system and predict slightly larger squeezing amplitudes than those observed in @xcite , which is expected due to the cavity enhancement in our system .",
    "however , photon correlations as strong as we report here can only be achieved by coupling a qd to a high - quality optical cavity , which has to be sufficiently polarization degenerate to enable our purification technique : the quantum dot transition has to couple simultaneously to both orthogonal polarizations , for details see the supplemental information @xcite .    in conclusion , we found that the nonlinear response of a lossy cavity - quantum dot system can be strongly enhanced by postselection of a particular polarization state .",
    "this leads to interference between fock states that experienced different modifications by the qd nonlinearity , and results in strong photon correlations of the transmitted light . as the underlying effect , interference of the two polarizations modes leads to high - fidelity cancellation of the single - photon transmission for the special polarization pre- and postselection . by correlating the results with a theoretical model",
