    "the telegraph random process describes the motion of a particle on the real line , traveling at constant speed , whose direction is reversed at the arrival epochs of a poisson process .",
    "after some initial works , such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , numerous efforts have been made by numerous authors and through different methods to analyze this process .",
    "various results on the telegraph process , including the first - passage - time density and the distribution of motion in the presence of reflecting and absorbing barriers have been obtained in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . a wide and comprehensive review devoted to this process",
    "has recently been offered by weiss @xcite , who also emphasized its relations with some physical problems .    in various applications in biomathematics",
    "the telegraph process arises as a stochastic model for systems driven by dichotomous noise ( see @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "two stochastic processes modeling the major modes of dispersal of cells or organisms in nature are introduced in @xcite ; under certain assumptions , the motion consisting of sequences of runs separated by reorientations with new velocities is shown to be governed by the telegraph equation . moreover ,",
    "the discrete analog of the telegraph process , i.e.  the correlated random walk , is usually used as a model of the swarming behavior of myxobacteria ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "processes governed by hyperbolic equations are also used to describe movement and interaction of animals @xcite and chemotaxis @xcite . moreover , the integrated telegraph process has been also used to model wear processes @xcite and to describe the dynamics of the price of risky assets @xcite .",
    "many authors proposed suitable generalizations of the telegraph process , such as the 1-dimensional cases with three cyclical velocities @xcite , or with @xmath0 values of the velocity @xcite , or with random velocities @xcite .",
    "see also the paper by lachal @xcite , where the cyclic random motion in @xmath1 with @xmath0 directions is studied .    a generalized integrated telegraph process whose random times separating consecutive velocity reversals have a general distribution and perform an alternating renewal process has been studied in @xcite and @xcite . along the line of such articles , in this paper we study a stochastic model for particles motion on the real line with two alternating velocities @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the random times between consecutive reversals of direction perform an alternating renewal process and are gamma distributed , which extends the erlang - distribution case treated in @xcite .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the stochastic process @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 denoting respectively position and velocity of the particle at time @xmath7 . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we obtain a series - form of the random motion probability law for gamma - distributed random inter - renewal times , whereas the mean value of @xmath5 conditional on initial velocity is finally obtained in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "we consider a random motion on @xmath8 with two alternating velocities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with @xmath9 .",
    "the direction of motion is forward or backward when the velocity is @xmath2 or @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "velocities change according to the alternating counting process @xmath10 characterized by renewal times @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 is the @xmath0-th random instant in which the motion changes velocity .",
    "hence , @xmath13 let @xmath4 be a stochastic process on @xmath14 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 give respectively position and velocity of the motion at time @xmath7 .",
    "assuming that @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for @xmath17 we have : @xmath18 denoting by @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) the duration of the @xmath21-th time interval during which the motion goes forward ( backward ) , we assume that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are mutually independent sequences of independent copies of non - negative and absolutely continuous random variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "otherwise , if there is at least one velocity change in @xmath26 $ ] , then @xmath28 w.p .  1 .",
    "hence , the conditional law of @xmath29 is characterized by a discrete component @xmath30 and by an absolutely continuous component @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 with @xmath17 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the formal conditional law of @xmath29 has been given in theorem 2.1 of @xcite for @xmath36 .",
    "case @xmath37 can be treated by symmetry .",
    "explicit results for the probability law have been obtained in theorem 3.1 of @xcite when the random times @xmath24 and @xmath25 separating consecutive velocity reversals have erlang distribution .",
    "this case describes the random motion of particles subject to collisions arriving according to a poisson process with rate @xmath38 if the motion is forward and rate @xmath39 it is backward . when the motion has initial velocity @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , then the first @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) collisions have no effect , whereas the @xmath0th ( @xmath42th ) collision causes a velocity reversal . in the following section we shall treat the more general case in which the random inter - renewal times are gamma distributed",
