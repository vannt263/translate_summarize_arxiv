    "the deflection of light rays by massive objects results in magnification of distant light sources when a massive body passes close to the line joining light source and observer .",
    "for a simple point - source - point - lens system , the magnification over time ( the `` light curve '' ) has a smooth symmetric form , whereas a binary lensing system may produce significant deviations from the simple light curve , although these are typically of short duration .",
    "a comparison of such light curves is shown in fig .",
    "these were generated using one of the models mentioned in @xcite , by sampling the number of light rays passing through a narrow strip of the magnification map .",
    "[ curves ]    this phenomenon , known as gravitational lensing , is used by astrophysicists in identifying characteristics of the lensing object .",
    "such an approach is useful in searching for dark matter , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the first exo - planet discovered using this approach was found in 2003 ( see @xcite ) , with several more discovered since that time .",
    "the presence of such planets in the lensing system can cause caustics in the magnification map .",
    "such caustics are described by @xcite .",
    "various techniques can be used to model such caustic patterns .",
    "the simplest of these is to deflect the light ray as it crosses the lensing plane ( this is the plane containing the lensing object , normal to the line joining the source and observer ) .",
    "the light path is then considered as two straight lines with an abrupt change of trajectory at the lensing plane . for a description of this method ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "the amount of deflection in such a model is given by the einstein deflection angle .",
    "as the deflection involved is very small ( which means that the photon passes through areas of weak gravitational fields only ) , such a `` first order '' approach is a very accurate approximation .",
    "recently , @xcite undertook a new approach , in which they used the schwarzschild metric to derive kinematic type laws for the propagation of light rays through a lensing system .",
    "they found that the acceleration vectors thus derived gave results in close agreement with those obtained using the simpler model described above .",
    "later , @xcite considered a linearized approximation , in which the light rays were assumed to deflect only slightly from an otherwise straight - line path .",
    "they showed that their linearized equations were capable of an exact closed - form solution which agreed well with the fully non - linear simulations . in the present paper ,",
    "the approach of @xcite is generalized to include the effects of relativistic frame dragging due to rotation of the lensing object , as described by the kerr metric .",
    "a kinematic description is given in section 2 .",
    "it is found that converting to cartesian co - ordinates simplifies the description of the light paths , by removing all acceleration terms at zeroth order .",
    "the non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) case is examined in section 3 , and rotation effects , which become significant at second order in the schwarzschild radius , are considered in section 4 .",
    "application to delay of pulses in a binary pulsar model is presented in section 5 , and concluding remarks are given in section 6 .",
    "the kerr metric describes spacetime outside an uncharged point mass , rotating or otherwise .",
    "the schwarzschild solution is contained as a special case wherein the mass has no angular momentum .",
    "such a solution has spherical symmetry , whereas for a rotating body , the system is axi - symmetric only . for any light path other than one confined to the equatorial plane , a fully three dimensional description of the path is required .",
    "this is different than for the schwarzschild case , where any path is confined to a plane , and can thus be treated as a two dimensional problem .",
    "we therefore begin with the kerr metric given in boyer - lindquist coordinates ( the conversion is described in section [ acccomp ] below ) , as written in chandrasekhar s thorough mathematical treatment of black holes ( @xcite )    @xmath0 ^ 2-\\frac{\\sin^2 \\theta}{\\rho^2}[(r^2+a^2)\\mathrm{d}\\phi - a\\mathrm{d}t]^2-\\frac{\\rho^2}{\\delta}(\\mathrm{d}r)^2-\\rho^2(\\mathrm{d}\\theta)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from this metric , the equations of motion can be derived . in this paper",

    "the other symbols are defined as : @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the mass of the body ; and @xmath10 is the angular momentum of the body .",
    "we are using geometrized units , that is , @xmath11 .",
    "finally , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants of the motion , related closely to the angular momentum of the particle .",
    "the first of these , @xmath12 , comes from the first integral of the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath14 , and the second , @xmath13 , is carter s constant , which is derived from the separation of the hamilton - jacobi equation for geodesic motion ( @xcite , p. 342 ) .      solving equations ( [ rdot ] ) and ( [ thetadot ] ) for @xmath15 and @xmath16 introduces square roots , for which the sign ( @xmath17 ) is ambiguous ( that is , either sign may be chosen ) .",
    "additionally , we found that numerical integrators such as the runge - kutta method find singular solutions such as closed orbits when integrating these equations , and so do not always find the path of unbound photons . to remove these difficulties ,",
    "we will take derivatives , producing acceleration components which have a simpler form than the first derivatives . as the parameterisation is arbitrary , for simplicity",
    "we first re - parameterise in order to remove the @xmath18 terms at the beginning of each equation .",
    "we choose a parameter @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "this has the result that each instance of @xmath21 on the left of the geodesic equations above becomes @xmath22 .",

    "it is therefore reasonable to say that the angular momentum term @xmath41 is of the same order of magnitude as the schwarzschild radius @xmath44 .",

    "the solution for @xmath142 now includes a rotational term ( dependent on @xmath41 ) , and becomes @xmath245 the conversion from @xmath19 to @xmath4 also now includes rotational terms @xmath246 this allows us to write the second order approximation of travel time delay as @xmath247 this delay is the same for a ray travelling from perihelion @xmath136 to @xmath141 on the right ( @xmath4 positive ) as for a ray travelling from @xmath141 on the left ( @xmath4 negative ) to @xmath136 .",
    "so the total delay for a ray passing the massive object at the origin is twice the amount @xmath248 stated above .",
    "it can be seen in this example , that if @xmath41 is positive ( that is , the mass has anti - clockwise angular momentum ) , the motion of the particle is opposite to the frame - dragging effects , and the travel time delay is increased .",
    "conversely , if @xmath41 is negative the travel time delay is decreased .",
    "@xcite has calculated the delay to second order in the limit @xmath249 .",
    "the delay given here in the last equation is in agreement with dymnikova s result in the same limit , but it also gives the second order delay for all values of @xmath141 .",
    "having explored the schwarzschild solution in the cartesian co - ordinate system , we are ready to move on to the rotating ( kerr ) case . we may start by adding the rotational terms of the acceleration equations ( [ xyzdd2a ] ) which are given in the appendix .",
    "these equations can be solved numerically using forward integration to produce a magnification map at the plane containing the observer .",
    "as the rotational terms are at second order and greater , the light rays must pass very close to the massive object to make a noticeable change to the trajectory .",
    "this is illustrated here by placing the light source close behind the massive lens . in order to observe the change in the pattern ,",
    "the light source and planet have been placed approximately @xmath212 away from the black hole , which is clearly not a tenable position for any massive object , but is chosen only to highlight the effect of rotation on the caustic pattern . the top picture in fig .",
    "[ kerr1 ] shows the normal diamond caustic without rotation as described by @xcite , and calculated here using the numerical procedure described in @xcite .",
    "this was generated using almost 15,000 simulated light rays in a numerical integration of equation ( [ schw1 ] ) .",
    "the lower figure uses the same procedure , but with the addition of the rotational terms .",

    "therefore it is reasonable to consider @xmath41 to be of order @xmath44 , that is @xmath220 where @xmath221 is a constant between @xmath222 and @xmath223 . in the appendix ,",
    "equation ( [ xyzdd2a ] ) has been approximated to second order , resulting in equations ( [ 2ndorderfull ] ) .",
    "expanding the first of these equations using the expansions ( [ xyz1 ] ) , yields @xmath224    in these equations , it can be seen that the first term on the right hand side is the schwarzschild acceleration discussed in some detail in section [ secschw ] , which we have already integrated to obtain second - order path equations .",
    "it therefore remains to integrate the remaining two terms and to add them to the second - order schwarzschild solution .",
    "the integration is straightforward , and following the same procedure for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we arrive at the second - order path equations .",
    "@xmath225 in which @xmath226 and @xmath227 are described in sections [ secschw1 ] and [ secschw2 ] .",
    "the remaining terms are @xmath228 in order to estimate travel - time delays , as above we write co - ordinate time @xmath4 as a function of @xmath19 . expanding @xmath229 to second order in @xmath44 , and integrating yields @xmath230 again ,",
    "the constants of integration have been determined by setting @xmath153 when @xmath118 .",
    "it is clear that in the equatorial case ( @xmath231 , which also means that @xmath232 and @xmath233 ) the above equations simplify to @xmath234 interestingly , while terms involving @xmath168 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 are all of second order in the expansion parameter , and terms with coefficients @xmath168 and @xmath235 appear in these equatorial equations , there are no such terms with coefficient @xmath236 .",
    "the regularity of pulses from a millisecond pulsar provides an interesting possibility for observing the effect of rotation on the travel time of the light pulses .",
    "a system such as the double pulsar binary system j0737 - 3039 described by @xcite may provide interesting possibilities for observing the delay due to a rapidly rotating massive object .",
    "we will construct a simpler mathematical model by replacing one of the pulsars in that system with a black hole ( with rotation also in the same plane as the orbit and observer ) so that there is confidence in using the kerr metric equations .",
    "thus we consider here a binary system consisting of a millisecond pulsar and a rotating black hole with the orbital plane aligned so that the observer and the two bodies are within the same plane .",
    "we also ignore any atmospheric or magnetospheric interference which may introduce complications in measurements in the real system mentioned above .",
    "finally we will ignore the modulation of the pulse timing due to the spinning of the pulsar .",
    "this last effect is expected to be small for a millisecond pulsar with an orbital period of hours or days , such as we are considering .",
    "having designed this system with the orbital plane and the observer in the equatorial plane of the black hole , we can use the simpler two dimensional equatorial equations of section [ sec42 ] to describe the paths of light rays from the pulsar to the observer .",
    "this is for simplicity and clarity only ; another arrangement using the full three dimensional equations is only slightly more difficult to describe and to code . in order to determine the delay of pulses due to the rotating black hole",
    ", we will send light rays back from the observer past the black hole using forward integration of the equatorial equations , stopping the integration procedure when the rays meet the orbital distance of the pulsar .",
    "as the time coordinate has been reversed , note that this also entails reversing the direction of spin of the black hole ( which is decided arbitrarily in this model , but should be considered when using data from a real system ) .",
    "figure ( [ pulsar1 ] ) shows the last section of rays as they reach the circular orbit of the pulsar . due to the large difference between the vertical and horizontal scales , and because only a small section of the orbit is shown , the endpoints of the rays appear to be in a line , but they do in fact form a circular arc .",
    "all distances shown are in light - seconds and times for the delays are in seconds .",
    "the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath44 ) of the black hole is @xmath250 light - seconds , equivalent to approximately @xmath251 solar masses .",
    "the delay increases in an almost linear relationship with mass of the lens , so that a black hole of @xmath252 solar masses would have approximately half the delay times as those shown in fig .",
    "[ pulsar2 ] . in a different study of travel time delay in a binary pulsar system ,",
    "@xcite note that in order for the binary system to have sufficient longevity for a reasonable chance of observation , there are limitations on the proximity of the pulsar to the black hole , with approximately @xmath253 solar radii being near optimum compromise between longevity and magnitude of the delay effect .",
    "we therefore place the circular orbit at @xmath254 light - seconds , approximately @xmath253 solar radii .",
    "this orbit induces a delay term in the straight - line time from @xmath255 seconds when the pulsar is closest to the observer , to @xmath256 seconds when it is furthest from the observer .",
    "however , in the present study , we are interested in the additional asymmetric delay due to rotation .",
    "the orbital delay is symmetric about the point of superior conjunction , or occultation , which occurs when the lensing body is directly between the pulsar and the observer , and is the point of interest for the present study . for this reason",
    ", the orbital delay will be ignored here .",
    "light - seconds , using forward integration past a maximally rotating central body ( @xmath257 ) . only the final sections of the rays are shown .",
    "rays passing very close to the mass , and experiencing large deflection , are not shown here because the images produced by such rays are extremely faint.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ pulsar1 ]    along with the equatorial equations , we also integrate equation ( [ tdot ] ) to keep track of the time coordinate .",
    "comparing the time taken with the time light would take to travel in a straight line from pulsar to observer without any lensing object gives the delay , shown in fig .",
    "[ pulsar2 ] .",
    "the solid curve represents the delay due to a rotating black hole , and was calculated using forward integration of the equatorial equations ( [ eqnequat1 ] ) given in the appendix .",
    "this delay is plotted against the angle from superior conjunction .",
    "that is , a zero angle represents the system with the black hole in between the pulsar and observer , while all three are in a line .",
    "the dashed line represents the delay due to a non - rotating black hole , calculated using the schwarzschild acceleration , equation ( [ schw1 ] ) .",
    "the part of the delay due to rotation is small , and so to highlight the difference between the delays shown , a magnified portion near the intersection is shown in the lower figure .",
    "[ pulsar2 ]    finally the delay due to maximal rotation of the black hole is subtracted from the delay due to a black hole of the same mass without rotation .",
    "the difference between these delays gives the delay due solely to rotation , which provides a small asymmetry in the delay curve in the rotational case .",
    "this difference is shown in figure ( [ pulsar3 ] ) .",
    "the upper and lower lines represent the delay difference for the two different images of the source , one passing to the left of the mass , the other to the right .",
    "one of these images is dominant prior to conjunction , and the other image becomes dominant after conjunction .",
    "[ pulsar3 ]    the delays due to lensing in this system are of the order of @xmath258 seconds , while the asymmetric part of the delay that is due to rotation is of the order of @xmath259 seconds . assuming other effects on travel time can be adequately accounted for , these rotational delays may be measurable , and could possibly be used to estimate the angular momentum of the lens .",
    "in this paper , we have presented cartesian acceleration components for photons using the kerr metric .",
    "while these components are somewhat complicated , they allow easy modelling of systems in cartesian coordinates , with the advantage that the components are normally very small .",
    "this allows for rapid numerical integration , and a new result ( the caustic shape due to a binary system with rotating mass ) has been presented . in order to approximate the light paths near a rotating black hole",
    ", we have built up the approximations in stages , beginning with the zeroth order and first order expansions , followed by the second order schwarzschild expansion and finally the second order kerr expansion . at each point , the versatility of this approach has been demonstrated by the ease of calculating deflection and travel time delay , which are found to match previously calculated amounts .",
    "in addition , a new formula for delay due to spinning black holes was presented .",
    "it may prove possible in some practical astrophysical circumstances to measure directly the delay due to rotation of the lensing object , and so to infer the angular momentum , using the formulae presented here .",
    "this awaits future experimental observation .",
