    "the extragalactic distance scale based on the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation and secondary distance indicators , such as the tully - fisher relation , the supernova standard candle @xcite , surface brightness fluctuations , and the fundamental plane has been criticized recently on the grounds that the pl relation may not be unique .",
    "indeed , the finite width of the cepheid instability strip in the hr diagram implies that nuisance parameters such as metallity and star formation history may play a role in determining the pl relation .",
    "metallicity was considered as a second parameter by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . @xcite",
    "have reviewed the situation and concluded that the cepheid pl relation is not universal .",
    "it is of interest , therefore , to see how well the distance scale can be measured without reference to cepheids at all . in this letter",
    "we use the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) distance indicator to calibrate the tully - fisher relation .",
    "the trgb is a good standard candle because it results from the helium flash on the red giant branch , which theory suggests is relatively immune to metallicity effects in old stellar populations .",
    "the trgb is unquestionably the most practical distance indicator for nearby galaxies .",
    "it is versatile , fast , and theoretically verified .",
    "the zero point of the trgb magnitude , however , has been debated in several papers . @xcite",
    "first derived the bolometric magnitude of the trgb .",
    "the distance modulus measured by the trgb method is then estimated via @xmath2 , where the bolometric correction ( @xmath3 ) and the bolometric magnitude ( @xmath4 ) are both dependent on the color of the trgb stars .",
    "using this calibration , the trgb magnitude in i - band is determined to be between @xmath5 and @xmath6 depending on the colors of the rgb stars found .",
    "the absolute zero point of this calibration was based on the distances to galactic globular clusters that were measured using the rr lyrae method zero point based on @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite presented a theoretical calibration of the trgb zero point and concluded that the empirical calibration by da costa & armandroff was too faint by @xmath70.1 mag , likely due to the fact that the rgb population of galactic globular clusters used in the empirical calibration were not well populated around the tip .",
    "most recently , @xcite explored the calibration issue and established a new calibration based on the assumed luminosity for the horizontal branch and the identification of this feature in five local group galaxies .",
    "this calibration gives the i - band trgb magnitude of @xmath8 at @xmath9 mag .",
    "furthermore , the @xcite calibration is not linked to the cepheid distance scale in any way and is completely independent .",
    "the sample for this section was drawn from those galaxies within 10 mpc with infrared photometry , distance estimates , and 21 cm data cataloged by @xcite and with v & i imaging in the hubble space telescope data archive ( table 1 ) .",
    "these images were downloaded and photometry carried out with the daophot software of @xcite .",
    "point spread functions ( psfs ) supplied by stetson for the h@xmath1 key project were employed @xcite for wfpc2 data . for acs data we used psfs constructed from the images themselves .",
    "the allstar program was run twice to obtain as deep a starlist as possible .",
    "areas of the galaxy with strong population i signatures were edited out .",
    "aperture corrections were made and color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) were calibrated and corrected for charge transfer effects ( cte ) following dolphin ( 2000 ) .",
    "acs data were calibrated as described by @xcite and corrected for cte using the standard algorithm .",
    "cmds for ngc 247 , 891 , 4826 , 4945 , and 5253 are shown in figures 15 .",
    "for the detection of the trgb in our target galaxies , we used the edge - detection method described in @xcite , and the results are recorded in table 2 . reddening values in the table are those of @xcite .",
    "literature values of trgb distance moduli are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have preferred our value of trgb , i = 24.10 to that of @xcite , whose measurement of i@xmath10 = 24.5 @xmath0 0.1 can be transformed to i = 24.03 , using v ",
    "i = 1.6 and the formulae of @xcite .",
    "six galaxies in our sample have cepheid distance moduli , and these are given in the last columns of table 2 .",
    "the principal sources of infrared and 21 cm data are @xcite and @xcite . for other galaxies we used isophotal magnitudes from the 2mass large galaxy atlas , transforming them with h@xmath11 ",
    "h@xmath12 = 0.27 @xmath0 0.03 mag , based on 123 galaxies in common . for ngc 4945 and",
    "5102 we used 20% velocity widths from hipass @xcite and @xcite respectively , correcting them for cosmology ( 1+z ) and inclination .",
    "following @xcite , we omitted the 3@xmath13 additive term in the inclination adopted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "column ( 5 ) of table 2 is the corrected infrared magnitude ; column ( 6 ) is the corrected velocity width .",
    "the tully - fisher relation for galaxies with trgb distances is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the ordinate is the absolute h magnitude corrected for internal extinction following @xcite . to correspond in range of velocity width to that of the cluster galaxies",
    "to which the calibration will be applied @xcite , we ignore galaxies with @xmath14 200 km s@xmath15 .",
    "the straight line in figure 6 is the calibration by @xcite using cepheid distances .",
    "the mean difference in distance modulus between the 14 trgb galaxies and the 21 cepheid galaxies is 0.19 @xmath0 0.13 mag . applying their cepheid tully - fisher calibration , @xcite found h@xmath1 = 67 @xmath0 3 @xmath0 10 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 . with our trgb",
    "tully - fisher relation applied to the same cluster data , we would obtain a 10% higher value , 73 @xmath0 5 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , where our quoted uncertainty is the statistical error only .",
    "@xcite obtained h@xmath1 = 71 @xmath0 4 @xmath0 7 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 from their multiwavelength cepheid - based tully - fisher calibration .",
    "the largest term in the 7 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 systematic error is due to the distance of the large magellanic cloud . the largest term in the absolute calibration of the trgb ( population ii ) distance scale is the uncertainty in m@xmath16 = 4.05 @xmath0 0.02 mag @xcite , associated with the absolute magnitude of the horizontal branch .",
    "our principal finding is that , within the 1.5@xmath17 uncertainty , the mean difference of the distance moduli derived from cepheids and from the trgb magnitude for our sample of 14 galaxies is consistent with zero .",
    "in addition , we conclude that the further steps to a more accurate cepheid - independent value of h@xmath1 are ( i ) a larger sample of trgb distances to galaxies which calibrate secondary distance indicators , ( ii ) multiwavelength photometry of these galaxies , and ( iii ) trgb calibration of type ia supernovae @xcite , surface brightness fluctuations , and the fundamental plane .",
    "this work is based on archival observations made with the hubble space telescope , which is operated by the space telescope science institute under a contract with nasa .",
    "this work makes use of 2mass data products , a joint project of the university of massachusetts and ipac / caltech , funded by nasa and nsf .",
    "in addition to daophot , this research has made use of iraf , which is distributed by noao .",
    "noao is operated by aura under a cooperative agreement with nsf .",
