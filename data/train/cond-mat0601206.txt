    "following the pioneering work of debye  @xcite , kirkwood  @xcite , and onsager  @xcite , the bulk dielectric response of polar materials is by now well understood  @xcite , and dielectric response is a method of choice for the experimental investigation of molecular dynamics in condensed matter .",
    "simulations of model polar systems have played a key role in our understanding of dielectric fluids  @xcite , and the subtle problems arising in the simulation of finite , but periodically repeated samples of such fluids , linked to the proper handling of boundary conditions , have been clarified in the eighties  @xcite . however , with few exceptions  @xcite , much less experimental , theoretical and numerical effort has gone into understanding the dielectric response of confined polar fluids .    consider a fluid of polar molecules trapped in a finite or infinite ( along one or two directions ) cavity surrounded by a dielectric material characterised by a permittivity different from that of the bulk polar fluid .",
    "the global dielectric response of the former is determined by the fluctuations and relaxation of the overall dipole moment of the trapped fluid .",
    "the question we wish to address is how the dipolar fluctuations are affected by confinement , i.e. by the presence of a surface separating the polar fluid from the dielectric material which surrounds the cavity .",
    "one can distinguish between two main effects due to the presence of such interfaces .",
    "the first is purely geometric : how are the dipolar fluctuations affected in the vicinity of a non - polarisable interface , compared to bulk fluctuations ?",
    "in particular , can one define a meaningful local dielectric permittivity tensor @xmath9 , when the polar molecules are restricted to stay on one side of a confining surface , with vacuum on the other side .",
    "this question has been recently addressed in the case of simple geometries ( slab or spherical cavity )  @xcite .",
    "the second effect arises from the electric boundary conditions which must be satisfied when the confining medium is polarisable , and hence characterised by a permittivity @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the second effect in the case of a simple polar fluid confined to a spherical cavity carved out of a dielectric continuum which extends to infinity in all directions .",
    "note that in the limit where the system consists of a single polar molecule fixed at the centre of the spherical cavity , the system reduces to onsager s celebrated model for the calculation of the permittivity of a polar material  @xcite .    the model of a polar fluid in a spherical cavity may be regarded as a crude representation of dual physical situations .",
    "one concerns micro - emulsions where inverse micelles are nanodroplets of water in oil , which are stabilised by a monolayer of surfactants .",
    "the majority oil phase then provides the embedding dielectric medium .",
    "the conjugate situation is that of a globular macromolecule ( i.e. a protein ) , made up of polar segments , dissolved in water .",
    "the connectivity of the macromolecule is then crudely accounted for by confining the unconnected polar residues to a spherical volume equal to that of the cavity . in that case",
    "the solvent ( water ) plays the role of the embedding continuum .",
    "consider a system of @xmath11 polar molecules confined to a spherical cavity of radius @xmath12 surrounded by an infinite dielectric continuum of permittivity @xmath2 .",
    "following related earlier work  @xcite the model which will be investigated is one of spherical molecules carrying extended ( rather than point ) dipoles consisting of two opposite charges @xmath13 displaced symmetrically by a distance @xmath14 from the centre of the molecule , such that the absolute dipole moment is @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the position of the centre of the molecule @xmath17 , and @xmath18 be the unit vector along the dipole moment of that molecule .",
    "the two charges @xmath19 are than placed at @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 is the electrostatic potential at @xmath22 due to a unit charge at @xmath23 , taking proper account of the electrostatic boundary conditions at the surface of the spherical cavity , then the total interaction energy of a pair of molecules @xmath17 and @xmath24 is : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the short - range repulsive potential between the spherical molecules , which is chosen to be of inverse power form as in  @xcite : @xmath27 with @xmath28 in practice .",
    "the exact form of @xmath21 for the spherical geometry is derived in the appendix by solving poisson s equation with the appropriate electrostatic boundary conditions .",
    "this cumbersome expression is not well adapted to simulations , and may be replaced by the approximation : @xmath29\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the permittivity of the empty cavity ( @xmath32 in practice ) and @xmath33 .",
    "the potential @xmath34 is seen to reduce to the bare coulomb potential when @xmath35 , i.e. in the absence of a dielectric discontinuity , and reduces to the classic result for a cavity surrounded by a conductor ( metallic boundary condition @xmath36 )  @xcite . in the approximation  ( [ e : phip ] ) the image charge is located at the same position as in the metallic boundary case , but its weight differs from -1 .",
    "atoms outside the sphere , making up the dielectric continuum of permittivity @xmath2 , are assumed to interact with the dipolar molecules inside the cavity by the short - range potential @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ e : v0 ] ) .",
    "these atoms are assumed to be distributed uniformly with a number density @xmath37 , so that the external potential acting on the molecules within the cavity is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "a straightforward integration leads to : @xmath40   \\end{split}\\ ] ] the external potential goes through a minimum at the origin , so that the external force vanishes at @xmath41 , as expected by symmetry . in practice",
    "the reduced density @xmath42 of the dielectric continuum is chosen to be equal to 1 , thus mimicking a dense medium .",
    "the coupled classical equations of motion for the translations of the molecular centres and the rotations of the dipoles were solved by a standard velocity verlet algorithm , using the gromacs molecular dynamics ( md ) package@xcite under constant temperature conditions , imposed by a berendsen thermostat and with a time - step @xmath43 fs .",
    "the values of the key physical parameters are listed in table  [ t : par ] .",
    "most simulations were carried out for samples of @xmath44 molecules and for three cavity radii @xmath45 , 3 , and 2.5 nm .",
    "nominal overall densities may be estimated as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an effective radius of the cavity .",
    "the latter may be estimated from the radial density profiles @xmath48 , to be introduced in the following section , by requiring @xmath49 .",
    "this makes the effective radius of the cavity roughly half a particle diameter smaller than the radius at which the dielectric medium starts .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following reduced variables :    .physical parameters as used in the simulations . both charges @xmath13 of the molecule carry a mass of 5 a.m.u . [",

    "the behaviour as a function of @xmath53 qualitatively confirms one of the observations already made at the lower density ( @xmath45 nm ) shown in fig.[f : ep40 ] , namely that the `` bulk '' values of @xmath31 agree within statistical errors for @xmath10 ( @xmath54 , 0.9 , and 1 ) , but are roughly a factor 2 lower than the value measured for @xmath6 .",
    "the error bars on the latter are much larger than those associated with the data for the polarisable embedding medium .    at the highest density ( @xmath0 nm ) , @xmath3 oscillates roughly in phase with the density oscillations .",
    "a proper `` bulk '' regime is never reached for the @xmath44 particle system , but one can extract a rough value of @xmath4 around which @xmath3 oscillates .",
    "these values , given in table  [ t : er ] , depend only weakly on @xmath53 , except for @xmath55 ( vacuum outside the cavity ) , when @xmath4 is roughly a factor of two larger than for @xmath56 ; the very noisy permittivity profile for @xmath55 is not shown in fig .",

    "it characterises the global response of the polar fluid trapped in the cavity rather than the local response , away from the confining surface .",
    "the values of @xmath31 are seen to lie systematically below those of @xmath4 , particularly so in the case @xmath55 .",
    "hence all information required to compute @xmath7 is contained in the total dipole autocorrelation function ( [ e : cmm ] ) .",
    "md results for @xmath64 are shown in figures [ f : cmm40 ]  [ f : cmm25 ] for the three cavity radii @xmath45 , 3 , and 2.5 nm , and four values of @xmath53 .",
    "the correlation functions are seen to relax to zero over a time scale of about 1 ps , which is an order of magnitude shorter than the relaxation time observed in the bulk for the same model  @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature is the strong sensitivity of @xmath64 to the polarisability of the confining medium , i.e. to @xmath53 .",
    "for all three radii , the relaxation is slowest for @xmath79 ( metallic boundary ) , and becomes faster as @xmath53 decreases .",
    "marked oscillations appear when @xmath55 ( @xmath6 ) particularly so at the highest density ( @xmath0 nm ) .",
    "simulations carried out on smaller samples of @xmath80 dipoles show that the relaxation patterns appear to be independent of the sample size characterised by @xmath12 and @xmath11 , provided the reduced overall density @xmath42 is the same .",
    "the decrease of the relaxation time of @xmath64 with @xmath53 agrees with the behaviour predicted for a debye dielectric  @xcite .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for the oscillation observed for @xmath55 .",
    "these oscillations are indicative of collective behaviour reminiscent of the dipolaron mode observed in md simulations of longitudinal dipolar fluctuations at finite wavenumber in bulk model polar fluids  @xcite.in an effort to gain a better understanding of the dipolar relaxation , we have also computed the normalised correlation functions :     versus time for @xmath50 nm , @xmath57 , @xmath81 and several values of @xmath77.,width=302 ]    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the instantaneous total dipole moment of all the molecules contained inside a sphere of radius @xmath84 . the md data are shown in figures [ f : cmmr10 ] and [ f : cmmr05 ] for @xmath79 and @xmath55 respectively . in the former ( metallic boundary ) case",
    "@xmath85 changes only moderately with @xmath77 .",
    "this is not totally unexpected , since the `` bulk '' permittivity of the sample is relatively large under these conditions ( @xmath86 ) , as seen from fig .",
    "[ f : ep30 ] , and hence the dielectric discontinuity is not too strong relative to the metallic embedding medium .",
    "the situation is very different when @xmath55 ( fig .",

    "@xmath85 changes relatively little with @xmath77 , and decays monotonically except when @xmath87 ( corresponding to the autocorrelation function of the total dipole moment of the sample ) , when @xmath88 decays much faster and oscillates .",
    "thus the dynamics of the molecular dipole moments inside the outer shell , in direct contact with the surface separating the confined fluid from vacuum , has a dramatic effect on the total dipole correlation function .",

    "[ f : chiw30 ] for the cavity of radius @xmath50 nm , and 4 values of @xmath53 . @xmath89 and @xmath90 vary with @xmath91 in a manner reminiscent of bulk behaviour  @xcite",

    "on the contrary the real and imaginary parts of the frequency - dependent permittivity defined by eq .",

    "[ f : epw30 ] .",

    "we have reported the first systematic attempt to investigate the dependence of the structure , static and dynamic correlations and response of a drop of polar fluid confined to a spherical cavity , on the permittivity @xmath2 of the embedding medium .",
    "the work extends earlier investigations which were restricted to the case of a non - polarisable external medium ( @xmath6 )  @xcite by treating the interactions between the charge distribution associated with the extended dipoles of the trapped fluid , and the image charges in an approximate , but accurate way , which provides an efficient alternative to the more cumbersome variational method proposed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the present treatment of electrostatic boundary conditions for the electric field of individual charges within the confined sample does not rely on macroscopic reaction field considerations , but is restricted to the spherical geometry .",
    "the md simulations were run for samples of @xmath44 polar molecules confined to cavities of radii @xmath45 , 3 , and 2.5 nm , which amount to effective densities of @xmath95 , 0.53 , and 0.92 .",
    "some test runs were carried out for a smaller sample of @xmath80 molecules , and no significant @xmath11-dependence was observed .",
    "the larger @xmath44 particle system allows a `` bulk '' regime to be reached within a substantial fraction of the accessible volume ( say up to @xmath96 ) , except for the smallest cavity ( i.e. highest effective density @xmath97 ) .",
    "all calculations were made with a reduced extended dipole moment @xmath57 , comparable to that of water .          1 .",
    "the structural properties embodied in the density profiles @xmath48 and the order parameter profiles @xmath98 are remarkably insensitive to the embedding medium , i.e. to @xmath53 .",
    "the density profiles show significantly less structure than their @xmath99 counterparts .",
    "the order parameter profiles point to a preferential alignment of the dipoles parallel to the confining surface , as already reported in earlier studies of related systems  @xcite .",
    "the static permittivity profiles @xmath3 may be calculated from the generalised kirkwood fluctuation relation ( [ e : ep])@xcite , or by measuring the polarisation profile @xmath100 , or charge profile @xmath101 induced by an `` external '' charge placed at the centre of the spherical cavity ( cf .",
    "( [ e : epr ] ) )",
    ". the latter method can only be implemented at the lowest density ( @xmath45 nm ) and points to a significant non - linearity compared to the predictions of the fluctuation formula , when the `` external '' charge is the proton charge .",
    "the fluctuation formula yields oscillatory @xmath3 profiles which essentially reflect the oscillations in the density profiles @xmath48 . at the two lower densities ( @xmath45 and 3 nm )",
    "the oscillations are sufficiently damped away from the confining surface for a `` bulk '' regime to be reached inside the cavity allowing the definition of a `` bulk '' permittivity @xmath4 .",
    "the latter turns out to be relatively insensitive to @xmath53 , except for @xmath55 ( cavity surrounded by vacuum ) , which leads to substantially larger values of @xmath4 . at the highest density ( @xmath0 nm ) ,",
    "the oscillations of @xmath3 extend up to the centre , so that no proper `` bulk '' regime is reached .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath4 may be extracted by averaging over oscillations . in all cases",
    "the `` bulk '' permittivity inside the cavity is strongly reduced relative to the values expected for a uniform ( genuinely bulk ) fluid under comparable conditions , an observation also made in earlier work  @xcite .",
    "3 .   while the static properties of a confined drop of polar fluid turn out the be surprisingly insensitive to the permittivity of the external medium except when @xmath102 , the dynamical properties depend much more on @xmath2 ( or equivalently @xmath53 ) .",
    "the most striking illustration is the correlation function @xmath64 of the total dipole moment of the sample , which relaxes faster when @xmath103 ( cf . figs .",
    "[ f : cmm40 ]  [ f : cmm25 ] ) .",
    "as also noted in earlier work  @xcite on confined water , the relaxation of @xmath64 is much faster than under comparable bulk conditions  @xcite .",
    "while such a behaviour may be rationalised by the absence of long - range dipolar interactions with distant molecules in the case of the confined system , which may lead to a lower collective `` inertia '' compared to the bulk , a detailed theoretical interpretation of the observation is still lacking . 4 .   the complex , dynamical permittivity was estimated from eq .",
    "( [ e : epw ] ) the corresponding cole ",
    "cole plots differ considerably from the semi - circular shape associated with exponential debye relaxation , as was to be expected from the complex relaxation pattern of the @xmath64 correlation function .",
    "while the high frequency regions of the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity are quite insensitive to the value of @xmath53 , significant deviations occur in the low - frequency regime ( cf .",
    "[ f : chiw30 ] and [ f : epw30 ] ) which are reflected in the right - hand parts of the cole ",
    "cole plots in fig .",
    "[ f : cole30 ] .",
    "the zero - frequency limits @xmath104 of the dynamical permittivity differ substantially from the `` bulk '' limits @xmath4 of the static permittivity profiles @xmath3 , as shown in table  [ t : er ] , which is not surprising since @xmath31 and @xmath4 measure `` global '' and `` local '' responses respectively .",
    "a theoretical analysis of the dynamical properties of confined polar fluids is left for future work .",
    "we also plan to explore the static and dynamic properties of polar fluids in narrow pores ( one - dimensional confinement ) and in slits ( two - dimensional confinement ) .        in this appendix",
    "we derive the electrostatic potential inside a spherical cavity of radius @xmath12 and permittivity @xmath31 , which results from the polarisation of an infinite medium with permittivity @xmath2 surrounding the cavity due to an internal charge distribution .",

    "this is the distance @xmath119 to the original charge . in the former , however , this is the distance to a location @xmath120 outside the cavity .",
    "the second summation can be simplified by expanding the legendre polynomial in terms of @xmath121 ( see ref .",

    "note that this approximation is exact in the case of a vacuum outside ( @xmath128 ) and in the case of metallic boundary conditions ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "there are two intuitive arguments for making this approximation .",
    "firstly , the field , except near the cavity wall , is mainly determined by the local charge distribution inside the cavity , rather than the image charge distribution arising from the polarisation .",
    "the second reason is that , since we consider a fluid of extended dipoles where the charge separation is roughly a third of the particle diameter , the two neglected parts of the induced charge distribution of both charges that form a dipole will cancel to a large extent .    in order to illustrate that the error made by the approximation is indeed small",

    "a second charge is put at various distances @xmath134 from the origin of the cavity , the result of which is shown in fig .",

    "the error increases both with decreasing cavity radius , and on approaching the cavity wall with one or both charges .",
    "note , that although the absolute error increases also when the charges get closer , the relative error in that case decreases due to the singular behaviour of the direct interaction between the charges ."
