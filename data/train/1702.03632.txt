    "networks have been extensively used to explore , model , and analyze the relational structure of individual units , or actors , in a complex system . in a network model , nodes represent the actors of the system , and edges are placed between nodes if the corresponding actors share a relationship . in many applications , the relationships among the actors of a modeled system change over time , necessitating the use of dynamic networks .",
    "two diverse examples , which we analyze later in our application study , include the congressional co - voting networks in figure [ figure : temporalnetworks1 ] and resting state brain connectivity networks in figure [ figure : temporalnetworks2 ] . a prominent way to analyze relational network systems is through the use of probabilistic models , or graphical models , which describe the generative mechanism of an observed network .",
    "although there is a rich body of literature on graphical models for static networks ( see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent surveys ) , the development of interpretable and computationally tractable models for dynamic networks is in its early stages .",
    "+    an important feature of dynamic networks that needs to be captured in any statistical model is the extent to which its local and global features change through time .",
    "we refer to this property as the network s _ temporal heterogeneity_. heterogeneity directly affects the underlying process that best describes the formation of the network . in parametric models , heterogeneity may result in significant changes in parameters that characterize the observed network .",
    "consider the u.s .",
    "senate co - voting network shown in figure [ figure : temporalnetworks1 ] .",
    "one can readily observe an evolution of the network to form distinct clusters of republicans and democrats by the 113th congress .",
    "moreover , this configuration is in stark contrast with the sparse , seemingly random configuration formed in the 40th congress . on the other hand , the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) network shown in figure [ figure : temporalnetworks2 ] remains fairly stable through time with only minor local changes in edge formation .",
    "these contrasting examples exemplify the need to explicitly model the heterogeneity of a network .",
    "we further analyze these dynamic networks in sections [ subsec : political ] and [ subsec : fmri ] .",
    "therefore , when modeling a dynamic network , accounting for its evolving structure is critical to making valid inferences and providing interpretable summaries of the network . in this paper",
    ", we propose a probabilistic model for dynamic networks called the varying - coefficient exponential random graph model ( vcergm ) .",
    "the model parameterizes time - varying topological features of dynamic networks in continuous time .",
    "our model builds on two major statistical methodologies .",
    "one is the exponential family of random graph models @xcite that characterizes the marginal effect of local and global network features on the likelihood of the network .",
    "the other major component of our model is a varying - coefficient specification @xcite , which flexibly models the changes of effect parameters over time .",
    "the vcergm characterizes the temporal heterogeneity of the dynamic network by modeling the parameter associated with each topological feature as a smooth function of time .",
    "one prominent advantage of the vcergm is its interpretability . by quantifying temporal heterogeneity of a network via fluctuating parameters , we are able to analyze key properties of the local and global features of a dynamic network .",
    "in addition to serving as a means to test for heterogeneity of a dynamic sequence , our method can also be directly used for interpolation of missing networks or edges . for networks at unobserved time points ,",
    "our method provides robust estimates that reflect the structure of the unobserved networks without being strongly influenced by outliers in the sequence .",
    "furthermore , estimation of the vcergm can be done with a computationally scalable maximum pseudo - likelihood estimation ( mple ) approach , enabling efficient inference for large dynamic networks .",
    "there are several dynamic network models that have been investigated .",
    "we briefly describe these here . the exponential random graph model ( ergm )",
    "is a family of probability distributions on unweighted static network .",
    "the ergm has been adapted to dynamic networks in the pivotal work of @xcite .",
    "the method is called the temporal exponential random graph model ( tergm ) .",
    "the tergm models the difference in topological features between every two consecutive networks in a similar fashion to the ergm .",
    "however , it ignores the heterogeneity of the differences , and can not fully capture the time - varying patterns of the network structure .",
    "in fact , we show that in a wide range of situations the tergm degenerates to a collection of independent and identically distributed ergms ( see section [ sec : motivation ] ) .    the tergm has been further investigated in many different perspectives .",
    "@xcite devised the hidden tergm ( htergm ) , which utilizes a hidden markov process to express the nature of rewiring networks and model a time - specific network topology .",
    "@xcite generalized the tergm to the separable tergm ( stergm ) .",
    "the stergm flexibly models the formation and dissolution of networks by separately parameterizing prevalence and duration of fluctuations . however , the stergm is essentially a special case of first - order tergm that it still can not capture the temporal heterogeneity .",
    "another method for dynamic network modeling is the stochastic actor - oriented model ( saom ) @xcite .",
    "it provides an alternative to dyadic models and instead is a localized actor - based model , which characterizes network evolution as a consequence of each actors connectivity .",
    "even if the saom considers the fluctuation between two time points , it does not provide explicit form to parametrize the fluctuation in network topology . @xcite and",
    "@xcite generalized the latent space model developed by @xcite to dynamic networks .",
    "the dynamics of network structure is modeled through random effects in a latent space .",
    "it focuses on the transition between two time points and provides limited description on overall network .    compared to time - invariant models described above",
    ", an alternative actor - based model was introduced in @xcite , where dynamic networks are modeled using multilinear tensor regression .",
    "this work adapted autoregressive models to dictate temporal dependence in a sequence of networks , and like the saom , proposed an actor - based dependence structure between edges in each network .",
    "it directly models the temporal heterogeneity but may not be adequate for larger networks due to its computational complexity . in the meantime , @xcite emphasizes on capturing time - varying attributes of dynamic networks and parametrizes the evolving relationship of each edge between nodes as a smooth function of time . along with kernel smoothing approach , the @xmath0-regularization is utilized to ensure the smoothness .",
    "the parameters in the model provide a valuable intuition in understanding the topological change of each edge , but fitting this model for larger networks can be computationally expensive considering the number of parameters .    as an alternative",
    ", the proposed model exploits a varying - coefficient framework to model the temporal heterogeneity of topological features .",
    "the varying - coefficient framework is a family of semi - parametric models , where the coefficient of a parametric model evolves with some characteristics in a nonparametric fashion .",
    "it was first developed to model non - linear effects of covariates on real - valued response variables @xcite .",
    "later it was extended to the dynamic generalized linear models @xcite .",
    "a detailed review of varying - coefficient models and their applications are provided in @xcite . in our proposed model ,",
    "we model the coefficients of the topological features in the ergm as a function of time . as a result",
    ", the varying coefficients effectively capture the dynamic pattern of the network structure .",
    "to our best knowledge , the vcergm is the first attempt to generalize the idea to modeling dynamic networks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the ergm and the tergm , and detail the relationship of these two models for a wide class of specifications . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the varying - coefficient exponential random graph model for dynamic networks .",
    "section [ sec : estimation ] describes the pseudo - likelihood estimation of the vcergm via penalized logistic regression .",
    "a hypothesis testing procedure for formally testing for temporal fluctuations in a sequence of time - varying graphs is introduced in section [ sec : hypothesis ] .",
    "we assess the performance of the vcergm on a series of simulated dynamic networks , comparing it to contemporary generative graph models in section [ sec : simulations ] . in section [ sec : applications ] , we apply the vcergm to the fmri and co - voting networks and analyze the dynamic nature of each of these applications .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our method and open areas for future research in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the ergm and its temporal extension the tergm provide an important starting point for our proposed work .",
    "before we begin discussing the vcergm , in this section we first describe both the ergm and the tergm and then shed light on a particular class of tergm specifications that provides motivation for our current work .",
    "in particular , we show that networks generated under the first - order tergm with sufficient statistics represented by _ difference statistics _ are stochastically equivalent to a sequence of identically and independently generated networks under the ergm .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is an unweighted network with @xmath2 vertices , whose @xmath3th entry @xmath4 is an indicator that specifies whether or not node @xmath5 and node @xmath6 are connected by an edge .",
    "the ergm is a probability distribution that characterizes the likelihood of @xmath7 via a function of network statistics @xmath8 that describe the topological structure of @xmath7 .",
    "one may include , for example , a statistic that quantifies the tendency of the nodes in the network to exhibit reciprocal ties using the reciprocity statistic @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite describes a means of determining which network statistics to include in a model based on collection of goodness of fit diagnostics .",
    "given @xmath10 , the ergm posits that @xmath7 is a binary random matrix generated from the following probability mass function @xmath11 where @xmath12 parameterizes the influence of the network statistics @xmath13 on the likelihood of @xmath7 .",
    "the ergm has been successfully applied in a wide variety of fields , ranging from social networks to brain connectivity networks @xcite .",
    "recent tutorials of exponential random graph models and their applications are provided in @xcite .",
    "the tergm is an important and popular statistical model for inference of dynamic networks @xcite , and can be described as follows . consider a dynamic network @xmath14 that is observed at @xmath15 discrete and non - overlapping time periods , where each graph @xmath16 from @xmath17 is unweighted , and observed for the set of vertices @xmath18 = \\{1 , \\ldots , n\\}$ ] .",
    "the tergm is a generative model for @xmath17 that characterizes the conditional probability of @xmath19 given @xmath20 via an exponential family of probability distributions . under the first order tergm",
    ", @xmath17 exhibits a one - step markov dependence between sequential networks as follows .",
    "@xmath21    under ( [ eq : markovassumption ] ) , one can fully specify the joint probability mass function of @xmath17 by parameterizing the one - step transitions from @xmath22 to @xmath19 .",
    "one models these dependencies using a function of transition statistics @xmath23 .",
    "these statistics represent the temporal potential over cliques across two sequential networks and can represent , for example , the change in the clustering or the change in overall connectivity between each pair of networks . for a chosen @xmath24 ,",
    "the first - order tergm specifies the likelihood of @xmath25 for @xmath26 as    @xmath27    where @xmath12 parameterizes the influence of the transition statistics @xmath28 on the conditional likelihood of @xmath19 given @xmath22 .",
    "suppose that the marginal distribution @xmath29 is specified .",
    "the tergm characterizes the joint distribution of the dynamic sequence @xmath17 by    @xmath30    we note that in general if one is able to specify appropriate transition statistics , then the tergm in ( [ eq : tergm ] ) and ( [ eq : tergm2 ] ) is readily generalized to higher - order markov dependency ; however , for discussion of our equivalence statement below we consider the first - order tergm only .      comparing the first - order tergm with model ( [ eq : ergm ] ) , we see that the tergm is closely related to the ergm in that it characterizes the conditional distribution of @xmath19 given @xmath22 using an ergm representation .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , these two models are much more closely related than this relationship .",
    "consider a simple univariate time series represented by the stochastic process @xmath31 for @xmath32 . without any other information about @xmath33 , a natural non - parametric manner to investigate the rate of change in @xmath33 involves analyzing the difference between sequential observations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , namely analyzing @xmath36 the analysis of @xmath37 in univariate and multivariate time series is known as _ differencing _ , and is a common first step in the analysis of time series data @xcite . in the context of the tergm",
    ", differencing corresponds to the analysis of _ difference statistics _",
    ", where one specifies transition statistics of the form @xmath38 where @xmath8 is a topological summary of an input network with @xmath2 vertices .",
    "statistics of the form in ( [ eq : difference ] ) can capture , for example , the differences in the edge weight of the network from time @xmath39 to @xmath40 , or the difference in the number of triangles from one network to the next .",
    "although incorporating difference statistics in the tergm is a natural first - step in the analysis of temporal networks , it turns out that doing so is equivalent to modeling each network @xmath41 as an independent realization from the _ same _ exponential family probability mass function .",
    "this is made precise in the next proposition .",
    "[ thm : equiv ] let @xmath42 denote the family of unweighted dynamic graph sequences on @xmath2 vertices with @xmath43 discrete observations .",
    "suppose that @xmath44 is generated under the tergm in ( [ eq : tergm ] ) , where for @xmath26 @xmath45 suppose @xmath46 is a difference statistic of the form ( [ eq : difference ] ) where @xmath47 for some @xmath48 .",
    "then for all @xmath49 , @xmath19 is independent of @xmath50 and can be generated as an independent realization of an ergm with the following probability mass function    @xmath51    proposition [ thm : equiv ] reveals that under the difference statistic model specification , a dynamic network under the tergm reduces to an independent and identically distributed sequence of graphs under a corresponding ergm .",
    "hence under this family of specifications , the tergm does _ not _ capture temporal dependence in the underlying dynamic network sequence .",
    "although in practice one may utilize statistics that are not of the form ( 4 ) , this relatively simple example motivates further investigation between the relationship of the ergm and the tergm .",
    "let @xmath52 be a stochastic sequence of temporally ordered networks observed continuously up to some time @xmath53 .",
    "at each time point @xmath40 , @xmath54 represents an unweighted , directed or undirected network with @xmath55 nodes .",
    "our goal is to provide a dynamic network model for @xmath17 that directly accounts for the temporal heterogeneity of its local and global network structure .",
    "the vcergm consists of two components - ( i ) an ergm representation for the marginal likelihood of each observed network , and ( ii ) the coupling of networks over time via a varying - coefficient model , where the coefficients at time @xmath40 parameterize the marginal likelihood of the network @xmath19 .",
    "we first specify a set of functions @xmath56 for @xmath57 $ ] , which quantify the same @xmath58 topological features of network @xmath59 with size @xmath55 .",
    "given @xmath60 and the coefficient vector @xmath61 , the marginal likelihood of @xmath19 at time @xmath40 has an ergm representation given by :    @xmath62    a large collection of topological features can be used in the vcergm . traditionally , the network statistics are raw counts of different features in an observed network , such as the number of edges ( edge density ) , the number of triangles , or the number of reciprocal edges in a directed network . however , in dynamic networks , networks at different time points may have differing numbers of nodes .",
    "thus it is not appropriate to use the raw counts directly .",
    "instead , one should standardize the network statistics to make them comparable over time .",
    "we propose to standardize the raw count of each feature by its maximal possible value , and use the standardized statistics in model .",
    "table [ table : networkstatistics ] provides examples of standardized network statistics for a binary graph @xmath19 with @xmath55 nodes , where @xmath63 represents whether there is an edge from node @xmath5 to node @xmath6 in @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath64 in model characterize the influence of the corresponding network statistics on determining the network structure .",
    "when a dynamic network evolves gradually over time , it is reasonable to believe the coefficients will also change gradually . in such a case , @xmath64 can be represented by smooth functions of @xmath40 with continuous second order derivatives over @xmath65 $ ] @xcite . the temporal dependence among the graphs in @xmath17 are captured by the dynamic pattern of the coefficient functions .",
    "this is the fundamental assumption of our model . in the special case where all the separate functions in @xmath64 are constant , the generative models underlying the dynamic networks are identical over time and the vcergm reduces to a family of marginally identically distributed ergms . in section [ sec : hypothesis ]",
    ", we introduce a formal hypothesis testing procedure to test the temporal heterogeneity of the coefficients .    without any constraint ,",
    "the collection of coefficients @xmath66 contain an infinite number of parameters , making inference on ( [ eq : vcergm ] ) intractable . to address this problem",
    ", we approximately represent these smooth functions as a linear combination of basis functions .",
    "possible strategies of defining basis functions include piecewise polynomials @xcite , fourier series @xcite , and wavelets @xcite . for inferential purposes , we employ basis splines ( b - splines ) @xcite as a way to reduce the dimensionality of estimation .",
    "b - splines are commonly used due to its flexibility in incorporating smoothing constraints . in particular , we first specify a collection of basis functions @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and then approximate @xmath69 by a linear combination of these functions @xmath70 where @xmath71 quantifies the contribution of the @xmath72th basis function on @xmath69 .",

    "we can represent the coefficients @xmath64 as    @xmath77    the set of @xmath76 basis functions represents the smoothness of @xmath64 , and the coefficient matrix @xmath78 determines the shape and trajectory of the fluctuations through time .",

    "define an indicator function @xmath174 which takes a value of 1 if @xmath175 is true and 0 otherwise .",
    "then the @xmath58-value can be written as @xmath176    the p - value is then used to determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis . for values below a specified significance value , @xmath163 , one rejects the null hypothesis in ( [ hyp_1 ] ) and decides that the sequence of networks does exhibit heterogeneity in its parameters . in our applications below ,",
    "we choose @xmath177 when evaluating any hypothesis test .",
    "the goal of our simulation study is three - fold : ( i ) to evaluate the power of the hypothesis testing procedure described in section [ sec : hypothesis ] , ( ii ) to assess the goodness of fit of the vcergm on dynamic networks with various magnitudes of temporal heterogeneity , and ( iii ) to assess the performance of the vcergm in the case that networks are missing at random . in section [ subsec :",
    "sim1 ] , we evaluate the sensitivity of the hypothesis test in ( [ hyp_1 ] ) for detecting temporal heterogeneity in a sequence of networks with fluctuating parameters using both the bootstrap procedure and the chi - squared approximation . section [ subsec : sim2 ] assesses the performance of the vcergm under various varying - coefficient specifications .",
    "we investigate four different specifications for @xmath64 and compare the performance of the vcergm with other competing methods using measurements of bias , variance , and robustness .",
    "we further investigate how the vcergm performs when the networks are observed at unequally spaced time points due to missing networks in section [ subsec : sim3 ] .",
    "we first investigate the power of the hypothesis test for heterogeneity that we introduce in section [ sec : hypothesis ] .",
    "to do so , we investigate both type i and type ii errors of the test on dynamic networks over various magnitudes of temporal heterogeneity .",
    "we simulate 100 sequences of dynamic networks @xmath178 , where each sequence @xmath179 , contains @xmath136 networks with 30 nodes observed at equally - spaced times @xmath137 under the vcergm that models the temporal contributions of the edge density statistic .",
    "we set the coefficient on the edge density term , @xmath180 , to be a sinusoidal curve with amplitude @xmath181 and period @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , we model @xmath182.\\ ] ] we vary the number of observed time points @xmath136 from 10 to 100 , and the amplitude @xmath181 from 0 to 0.3 in increments of 0.05 . for each value of @xmath136 and @xmath181",
    ", we calculate the proportion of cases that we reject the null hypothesis at a @xmath177 level out of the 100 simulated dynamic network sequences .",
    "table [ table : hypothesissimulation ] reports these proportions when using the bootstrap procedure as well as the chi - squared approximation .",
    "when @xmath183 , @xmath180 is a constant function and as a result the proportion of rejections in this case provides an estimate for the type i error of each test . from table",
    "[ table : hypothesissimulation ] , we see that both strategies obtain a type i error at or below 0.05 , as desired . for @xmath184 ,",
    "the proportion of rejections provides an estimate of the power of the test .",
    "we see that for higher signal ( larger @xmath181 ) and for a larger number of observed networks ( larger @xmath136 ) , we obtain a higher power , as expected . across @xmath136 , we see in general that the bootstrap procedure is consistently more powerful than the use of the chi - squared reference distribution for each amplitude value @xmath181 . for @xmath185",
    "the power of both tests reaches 1 , indicating that heterogeneity is successfully identified by both tests .",
    "these results suggest that both tests are powerful for large enough signal size , and that the bootstrap procedure outperforms the chi - squared approximation for small signal sizes ( between @xmath186 and @xmath187 ) .",
    "we now evaluate the performance of vcergm to accurately estimate fluctuating parameters @xmath64 , @xmath188 $ ] .",
    "we consider four different settings for @xmath64 : ( i ) sinusoidal curve of varying amplitude ; ( ii ) quadratic curve of varying strength ; ( iii ) a dynamic erds - rnyi random graph ; and ( iv ) non - smooth ( spiky ) functions . for each setting of varying coefficients , we model the occurrence of graphs using the vcergm with edge density and reciprocity statistics ( see table [ table : networkstatistics ] ) .",
    "we vary the ( i ) amplitude @xmath189 of sinusoidal curves @xmath190 ; ( ii ) coefficient @xmath189 of quadratic curves @xmath191 ; ( iii ) probability @xmath58 of edges for erds - rnyi ; ( iv ) mean and standard deviation of normal distribution from which we generate a sequence of random numbers .",
    "we simulate 100 dynamic sequences of directed graphs @xmath192 where each sequence @xmath193 is observed at @xmath194 equally - spaced time points .",
    "we assume that the network size remains constant through time and consider estimation with networks of three different sizes @xmath195 .    for each simulated dynamic network , we compare the vcergm with two other dynamic network models .",
    "first , we fit cross - sectional ergms , where the ergm in model ( [ eq : ergm ] ) is fit separately at each of the @xmath136 observed time points . as an alternative competitive method , we also develop an ad hoc 2-step procedure , which adapts an ad hoc smoothing procedure after fitting cross - sectional ergms for observed networks . to assess the performance of each method , we calculate the integrated absolute error ( iae ) of the estimated coefficient curves .",
    "it measures the sum of point - wise absolute difference between estimated curve @xmath196 and the true curve @xmath180 at observed time points @xmath137 , namely @xmath197    the mean and standard deviation ( sd ) are calculated to evaluate the performance of our proposed method compared to cross - sectional ergms and ad hoc 2-step procedure .",
    "we provide the summary of iae for each method on dynamic networks with 30 nodes in table [ table : simulation ] , and plot the estimated coefficient curves in figure [ figure : simulation2 ] .",
    "settings for the results are ( i ) sinusoidal curves with @xmath198 ( edges ) and @xmath199 ( reciprocity ) ; ( ii ) quadratic curves with @xmath200 ( edges ) and @xmath201 ( reciprocity ) ; ( iii ) erds - rnyi with @xmath202 ; ( iv ) a sequence of random numbers from @xmath203 ( edges ) and @xmath204 ( reciprocity ) .",
    "the performances of cross - sectional ergms , ad hoc 2-step procedure , and vcergm become more comparable with larger network size . for results of @xmath205 and @xmath206 case ,",
    "see tables [ table : simulation50 ] and [ table : simulation100 ] in appendix [ appendix : result ] .",
    "according to figure [ figure : simulation2 ] , cross - sectional ergms are more likely to introduce unexpected spikes or increased variability in estimating true @xmath64 , compared to vcergm .",
    "overall , the vcergm presents smaller deviation from true @xmath64 with smaller variability compared to cross - sectional ergms and ad hoc 2-step procedure . in the first three settings , the vcergm performs better than cross - sectional ergms and ad hoc 2-step procedure with smaller iae . in case of non - smooth functions , with true @xmath64 not smooth but wiggly",
    ", the ad hoc 2-step procedure shows better performance than the vcergm with respect to iae .",
    "both table [ table : simulation ] and figure [ figure : simulation2 ] indicate that the vcergm potentially misses the random wiggles , which causes greater bias on average compared to cross - sectional ergms .",
    "regardless , the overall trend that the true non - smooth @xmath64 presents is fairly well estimated by the vcergm and the variability of the estimates is still smaller for the vergm compared to cross - sectional ergms .",
    "overall , the performance of ad hoc 2-step procedure and vcergm is comparable , but the vcergm is more principled in terms of incorporating time - varying coefficients in the modeling step .",
    "for all four settings , the vcergm is computationally more efficient than the cross - sectional ergms .",
    "we conduct an additional simulation study specifically tailored to compare the computing time between methods and the results are presented in table [ table : computing ] .    in order to compare the computational efficiency , we vary the number of time points @xmath136 and record the computing time for vcergm and cross - sectional ergms .",
    "table [ table : computing ] summarizes the computing times of 500 simulated dynamic network sequences and displays how computing time changes as the number of time points @xmath136 changes . according to table [ table : computing ] , the vcergm takes significantly less time than cross - sectional ergms to complete the parameter estimation .",
    "even if both vcergm and cross - sectional ergms show linear increase in computing time , the rate of change is much smaller for vcergm .",
    "both methods entail @xmath136 separate steps to construct design matrix and response vector at each time point , but the cross - sectional ergms require @xmath136 separate mple steps while vcergm only needs one estimation .",
    "in other words , the longer the time series of networks are , the more efficient vcergm is compared to cross - sectional ergms .",
    "we repeat ( i)-(iv ) in section [ subsec : sim2 ] with 1 , 5 , and 10 randomly chosen networks removed from the time series to evaluate the performance on dynamic networks with observations missing at random .",
    "we provide the iae of each method in table [ table : simulation30 ] and show the coefficient estimates in figure [ figure : simulation3 ] . as cross - sectional ergms",
    "are no longer available to provide the estimates at unobserved time points , the iae is calculated based on observed time points only .",
    "notably , the performance of the vcergm remains stable across each number of missing networks .",
    "cross - sectional ergms and the 2-step approach , on the other hand , suffer more than the vcergm in the case of missing networks . indeed , as shown in table [ table : simulation30 ] , the vcergm outperforms these competitive methods in the case that observations are missing and is better able to capture the true coefficient curve in these cases .",
    "in this section we apply the vcergm to two case studies which portray differing amounts of temporal heterogeneity .",
    "first , we analyze how the co - voting patterns among u.s .",
    "senators have changed through time . in this example",
    ", we analyze the effects of political affiliation ( republican or democrat ) on the likelihood of the voting networks . in our second example",
    ", we investigate the structural changes of the resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rfmri ) records of healthy individuals . for each case study , we first test for temporal heterogeneity of any statistic included in the model .",
    "we fit the vcergm on the two data sets and also fit cross - sectional ergms and ad hoc 2-step procedure for comparison . in the first example",
    ", we witness a clear evidence of temporal heterogeneity that the importance of political affiliation on the likelihood of the voting networks significantly changes over time . on the contrary ,",
    "relatively stable rfmri networks show little fluctuations through time and our method is shown to accommodate it successfully as well .",
    "we begin by analyzing the dynamic network that describes the co - voting patterns among u.s .",
    "senators from 1867 ( congress 40 ) to 2015 ( congress 113 ) .",
    "three of the voting networks are shown in figure [ figure : temporalnetworks1 ] .",
    "this network was first investigated in @xcite and has been subsequently analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the network is based off of the roll call voting data from http://voteview.com , which contains the voting decision of each senator ( yay , nay , or abstain ) for every bill brought to congress . we model the co - voting tendencies of the senators using a dynamic network where nodes represent senators and an edge is formed between two nodes if the two senators vote concurrently ( both yay or both nay ) on at least 75% of the bills to which they were both present .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure : temporalnetworks1 ] , there exist great fluctuations in network structure through time .",
    "previous analyses in @xcite have identified significant changes in the community structure of the network over time , and that this community structure is closely associated with political affiliation of the senators . to account for these fluctuations ,",
    "we incorporate a node - match statistic for political affiliation which counts the number of edges shared between senators who have the same political affiliation .",
    "furthermore , we include a statistic which models popularity ( two - star ) and clustering ( triangle ) of the senator networks .",
    "see table 1 for more details of these two statistics .",
    "we note that it is of separate interest to perform model selection for the vcergm ; however , we pursue this in future work . here , we compare and contrast the results of a simple model when using several viable dynamic network models .",
    "the estimated parameters from i ) cross - sectional ergms ( ergm ) , ii ) ad hoc 2-step procedure ( ergm2 ) and iii ) vcergm are presented in figure [ figure : politicalestimate ] .",
    "notably , all three network statistics exhibit temporal heterogeneity .",
    "the asymptotic chi - squared @xmath58-value for testing heterogeneity is @xmath207 .",
    "consistent with our simulation results , the cross - sectional ergms exhibits spiky estimates , but the ad hoc smoothing recovers the lack of smoothness efficiently and produces similar estimates as the vcergm . the political nodematch parameter estimate reveals an important trend in the political network .",
    "we see that the coefficient value for this term generally increases over time , indicating the increasing importance of political affiliation on the co - voting habits of the senators throughout u.s . history . in particular since congress 95 , this coefficient has significantly increased .",
    "this finding matches the current theory of `` political polarization '' described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure : politicalestimate ] also suggests that the triangle coefficient has decreased in magnitude suggesting that clustering has become less and less important over time .",
    "we next analyze the structure of brain connectivity in the data provided by the wu - minn consortium human connectome project ( hcp ) .",
    "the dataset is available at https://db.humanconnectome.org .",
    "see @xcite for an overview of data acquisition and analysis .",
    "the dataset includes the resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rfmri ) of 500 subjects . for each subject ,",
    "a 15-minute run of rfmri is recorded .",
    "we set 47 local windows and calculate a partial precision matrix between 50 brain regions based on observations within each window . for a transition from precision matrices to sequence of dynamic networks ,",
    "we define the edge density of a network as the proportion of edges in the network .",
    "once the edge density is specified , the threshold of partial precision value can be determined to form an edge between the brain regions . with the edge density of 10% , for example , the greatest 10% of partial precision values would form edges .",
    "@xcite and @xcite fit the ergms to brain networks and conducted extensive model selection .",
    "their final model includes network statistics such as geometrically weighted edge - wise shared partner ( gwesp ) and geometrically weighted non - edge - wise shared partner ( gwnsp ) .",
    "we keep our analysis simple for sake of comparison of methods .",
    "we model our rfmri networks with three network statistics : edges , triangle and two - star and compare i ) cross - sectional ergms ( ergm ) , ii ) ad hoc 2-step procedure ( ergm2 ) and iii ) vcergm .",
    "we leave the model selection for the vcergm for future research .",
    "figure [ figure : fmriestimate ] shows the results of two individuals from this study .",
    "as the data are the resting - state fmri records , little fluctuation is expected in parameters over time . for both individuals , both ad hoc 2-step procedure and vcergm provide estimates with a small range of fluctuation for all three network statistics .",
    "overall , the ad hoc 2-step procedure and vcergm provide relatively similar estimates , while both estimates cross the cross - sectional ergm estimates .",
    "the estimates from cross - sectional ergms are extremely jagged that they may introduce inaccurate inference with regard to explaining the topological change in brain networks over time .",
    "the vcergm not only produces fairly static estimates but also captures small variations through time more sensitively than ad hoc 2-step procedure .",
    "therefore , even with relatively stable dynamic networks , the vcergm performs consistently well .",
    "in this paper , we introduce varying - coefficient models for dynamic networks . in particular , we described the formulation and estimation of the vcergm , a model that incorporates temporal changes in the coefficients of an exponential random graph family of models .",
    "we demonstrated the advantages of applying the vcergm over competing methods through simulations and two dynamic network case studies .",
    "first , the vcergm provides an intuitive explanation of how a network changes through time .",
    "both the cross - sectional ergms and ad hoc 2-step procedure seemed to capture the temporal heterogeneity in a sense .",
    "however , by incorporating the temporal heterogeneity in the modeling step , the vcergm provides a compact and meaningful model to formally explain the temporal structure of dynamic networks .",
    "second , the vcergm is robust to perturbations in observed temporal data . by imposing smoothness on the coefficients , we are able to provide robust estimates that are resistant to outliers and noise .",
    "third , the vcergm enables interpolation for missing networks through time . in practice",
    ", one can only observe a finite number of networks in a dynamic sequence , which may be observed in unequally spaced time increments .",
    "estimates of the coefficients to the vcergm can be evaluated at any time point in the domain and immediately interpreted as the impact of network statistics at that time point . by presenting the results with unequally - spaced networks",
    ", we illustrated how the varying - coefficients through time can be useful especially in terms of interpolation .",
    "our work provides several avenues for future research .",
    "first , it is important to consider the evaluation of goodness of fit and model selection in a dynamic context . through empirical exploration",
    ", we found that the network statistics used to fit a model are often highly correlated .",
    "for example , if there exists a triangle in a network , it is more likely to find two - stars in the network .",
    "model identifiability should be investigated both in static ergm models and the vcergm to ensure appropriate model selection . for static ergms",
    ", one generally assesses goodness of fit through a comparison of quantitative summaries of simulated networks from the fitted model with the summaries of the observed network @xcite .",
    "however , for dynamic networks this type of goodness of fit comparison captures only the marginal aspects of the dynamic sequence . how exactly to assess the quality of a dynamic model is still an open problem .",
    "a second avenue for future work involves adapting the varying - coefficient framework introduced here to networks with weighted edges . to do this",
    ", one can extend the exponential models of networks for integer - valued weights from @xcite or to the models of networks for continuous - valued weights considered in @xcite .    in many dynamic networks ,",
    "it is often of interest to identify change - points in the network , namely points in time where the network undergoes significant local or global structural change @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to further analyze how to utilize dynamic network models like the vcergm to identify such changes .",
    "the test for heterogeneity that we use in the paper may provide some idea of how to formally test for a change - through identification of a change in network parameter - however , in future research we plan to purse this idea further .    finally , we will investigate adapting a varying - coefficient model for networks with a markov dependency . in this paper , we investigated the dynamics of coefficients for marginal network statistics .",
    "however , this model can readily be extended to networks with a markov dependency like that described by the first order tergm . in general , for any non - negative integer @xmath76 , one can model higher order dependencies between @xmath76 successive networks .",
    "for example if we assume the one - step markov dependence in ( [ eq : markovassumption ] ) , we can model the one step transition between @xmath22 and @xmath208 using a suite of statistics @xmath209 as @xmath210 in model ( [ eq : vcergmlag ] ) , @xmath211 can be modeled as smooth functions that describe the impact of the one - step transition statistics from @xmath212 to @xmath59 . therefore , model ( [ eq : vcergmlag ] )",
    "effectively captures the rate of change of the temporal potential between sequential graphs rather than the rate of change of the marginal features as done in this work . like the tergm",
    ", we can generalize the vcergm to a higher order markov dependency , say order @xmath213 , by specifying appropriate transition statistics @xmath214 .",
    "the fmri data were provided [ in part ] by the human connectome project , wu - minn consortium ( principal investigators : david van essen and kamil ugurbil ; 1u54mh091657 ) funded by the 16 nih institutes and centers that support the nih blueprint for neuroscience research ; and by the mcdonnell center for systems neuroscience at washington university .",
    "gen li s research was partially supported by the calderone junior faculty award from the mailman school of public health at columbia university .",
    "the tuning parameter @xmath142 controls the amount of roughness .",
    "we implement the iteratively reweighted least squares ( irls ) to fit the logistic regression with the penalty term .",
    "consider a link function @xmath216 and a convex function @xmath217 .",
    "the irls without penalty term updates @xmath218 at the @xmath219th iteration @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath223    with the penalty term @xmath224 , we only need to replace @xmath225 by @xmath226 in ( [ eq : irls ] ) .",
    "the generalized cross validation ( gcv ) is used to choose the tuning parameter @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "namely , the @xmath142 is a minimizer of @xmath227 , which is defined as @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the number of rows in matrix @xmath120 .",
    "tables below show the mean and standard deviation of iae associated with fitting ergms and vcergms to temporal networks of size 50 and 100 with 0 , 1 , 5 , and 10 randomly missing networks .",
