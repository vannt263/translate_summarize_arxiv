    "all stars originate in clouds of cold , dense molecular gas ( evans 1999 ) .",
    "the formation of low - mass stars has been studied in depth and the process by which it occurs is believed to be fairly well understood ( shu , adams , & lizano 1987 , andr et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , the formation of stars with masses greater than @xmath28 @xmath3 is more difficult to examine because the regions in which they form are considerably farther away ( wu et al .",
    "high - mass stars may not simply be a scaled - up version of low - mass stars , but instead may be formed in a fundamentally different way ( e.g. , competitive accretion , core coalescence vs. scaled - up accretion ; see mckee & ostriker 2007 ) . a complete theory of star formation requires an understanding of the efficiency and rate of forming stars across the entire stellar mass range .",
    "in the last few years , a new nomenclature has been adopted to describe the structure of galactic star - forming regions within molecular clouds .",
    "protostars form from individual dense cores of gas .",
    "most protostars form in clustered environments and collections of cores which may be physically connected or gravitationally bound within a larger clump .",
    "clumps located in the milky way are near enough to be observed in detail using submillimeter single - dish telescopes with resolutions of tens of arcseconds ( e.g. , reiter et al .",
    "the information gained from studies of these local star - forming clumps can be used to understand star formation in galaxies too far away to resolve individual star - forming regions .",
    "ultimately , these studies may be used to constrain a universal star formation law .    determining the rate and efficiency of star formation has been a long standing problem .",
    "schmidt ( 1959 ) first proposed that the rate of star formation would depend on the volume density of dense gas according to a power law .",
    "building upon this assumption , it was shown globally for galaxies that the power law phrased in terms of surface density gave @xmath4 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "this relation , which was derived using co to trace the molecular gas and hi to trace the atomic gas is called the kennicutt - schmidt relation ( k - s relation ) .",
    "even with the resolution of state - of - the - art interferometers , the k - s relation has only been probed down to scales of @xmath5 kpc , much larger than the sizes of giant molecular clouds ( tens of pc ) in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , bigiel et al .",
    "the k - s relation has been questioned because co observations probe low density molecular emission and not the dense molecular gas more directly associated with the clumps and cores from which protostars form ( e.g. gao & solomon 2004a ) .",
    "therefore , subsequent studies have tested the power law relation by measuring the molecular line luminosity of tracers that specifically trace the dense gas mass .",
    "infrared luminosity is used as a measure of the star formation rate ; collapsing protostars emit strongly in the ir . using the line luminosity of the transition hcn ( 1 - 0 ) and infrared luminosity of a set of 65 galaxies , including luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) , gao & solomon ( 2004a , b ) found a power law index of @xmath6 .",
    "they interpreted this result as the sfr being proportional to dense gas mass ( gao & solomon 2004a , b ) .",
    "this hcn ( 1 - 0 ) survey was extended to the scale of galactic dense clumps with similar results ; the power law index was very near one over a range of 7 orders of magnitude in @xmath7 ( wu et al .",
    "2005 , wu et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this was interpreted as evidence that there is a fundamental unit of star formation associated with massive clumps with luminosities l@xmath8  and the star formation efficiency within the dense clumps is constant .    since the initial work of gao & solomon and wu et al .",
    ", a wider range of critical densities has been probed by different molecular tracers ( e.g. , bussmann et al .",
    "2008 , juneau et al .",
    "theoretical radiative transfer models predict the behavior of the sfr and line luminosity as a function of gas density on galactic scales ( krumholz and thompson 2007 , narayanan et al .",
    "the behavior of the line luminosity is dependent on the critical density of the tracer in these models ; if the critical density exceeds the mean density , the line luminosity rises superlinearly with density .",
    "however , for critical densities below the mean density , it rises linearly .",
    "the sfr is assumed to rise superlinearly with density in these models , , where @xmath9 is the density of molecular hydrogen in @xmath10 similar to the original schmidt relation ( 1959 ) but different from the conclusion of gao & solomon . combining the two conditions",
    "gives linear correlations for high critical density tracers and superlinear correlations for low critical density tracers .",
    "this general trend is observed in galaxies using co ( 1 - 0 ) , hcn ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) , and hco@xmath0 ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) ( juneau et al . 2009 , also see baan et al .",
    "2008 , iono et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "gao and solomon ( 2004 ) and wu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) interpret their results as evidence that the sfr to dense gas mass ratio is constant .",
    "however , the extragalactic community and many theoretical models continue to assume a superlinear schmidt relation . in this paper ,",
    "we test the observed gao & solomon and wu et al .",
    "correlation by mapping a sample of 16 massive clumps in hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) selected from the bolocam galactic plane survey ( aguirre et al .",
    "this sample is combined with 27 massive clumps mapped in hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) that are associated with water masers from reiter et al .",

    "( 2009 ) that were adapted from graci - carpio et al .",

    "we also re - analyze the 50 dense clumps from wu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and 42 galaxies from gao and solomon ( 2004 ) to verify the published hcn correlation .",
    "we choose hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) because of its ability to trace nearly identical excitation conditions to hcn ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "the frequency and dipole moment of hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) are a factor of @xmath23 and @xmath21.5 times higher , respectively , than the corresponding values of hcn ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "the einstein a coefficient is proportional to @xmath11@xmath12 , making the einstein a coefficient of hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) @xmath2 60 times higher .",
    "most of this disparity is compensated by hco@xmath0 inducing dipoles in the molecules with which it interacts , increasing the effective cross section for collision and the corresponding collision rate @xmath13 .",
    "hcn is not an ion , so it does not induce a dipole in nearby molecules and it has a comparatively lower rate of de - excitation . at 20 k , hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) and hcn ( 1 - 0 ) have critical densities of @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 , respectively , a factor of @xmath23.1 difference . since the excitation of a molecular line varies gradually over a range of densities , claiming the line traces gas at the critical density is an oversimplification ( evans 1999 ) .",
    "a more practical quantity is the effective density for excitation , @xmath17 , which is defined as the density at which a transition will have a radiation temperature of 1 k assuming log(n/@xmath18v)=13.5 @xmath19/km / s and an average kinetic temperature of 20 k ( evans 1999 , reiter et al .",
    "the two transitions also have even more similar effective densities ; hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) and hcn ( 1 - 0 ) have effective densities of @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath16 .",
    "these only differ by a factor of @xmath21.5 .",
    "densities can range over several orders of magnitude within molecular clouds , so such a small difference means that the transitions essentially trace the same molecular gas in the absence of strong chemical differentiation .    in  2",
    ", we summarize the observations of our sample of 16 massive cores as well as the full ( combined ) sample used in this paper . in  3 , we discuss the methods used to derive physical quantities from the maps .",
    "we present our results and compare them to both other observations and theoretical predictions in  4 as well as critically discuss several caveats with the interpretation of the observed correlation .",

    "the point sources indicate the presence of either an embedded protostar or an evolved star .",
    "each bgps source within 15 of the point source was considered to contain a candidate embedded object .",

    "galaxies which had upper or lower limits on the molecular line luminosity were not used in our analysis .",
    "the maps in integrated intensity of hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) emission are shown in figure 1 .",

    "the peak integrated intensities are usually near the center of the map , but that is not always true , especially when there are two objects in a single map . the total sample of galactic cores mapped in hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) had a mean intensity of @xmath39 k km@xmath24 and a median of 36.5 .",
    "the standard deviation of the sample is relatively large because the sources cover a wide range of intensity from 3.2 to 195.9 k km s@xmath24 .",

    "the bgps / rms mean is skewed upward by a large source ( 019.884 - 053 ) which is also the brightest in that sample .",
    "a histogram of the sizes is presented in figure 2 along with histograms of other physical properties .",
    "distances were obtained by using radial velocity measurements to get kinematic distances ( schlingman et al .",
    "kinematic distances are ambiguous in that two different distances correspond to the same radial velocity in the first quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "four sources were assigned to the near distance because they appear to be associated with an infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) as determined by visual inspection of mipsgal images .",
    "the remaining distances were determined using information supplied by the rms online catalog ( urquhart et al .",
    "2008 ) which not only gives kinematic distances , but also a `` complex distance . ''",
    "the complex distance was for any mysos belonging to a complex with a previously determined distance .",

    "the distance probability curves are typically bi - modal ( centered on the near and far kinematic distances ) .",
    "each mode of the probability curves were fit by gaussians , one for the near distance and one for the far distance , to determine the spread of the curves .",

    "the remaining 19 sources without distance probability curves were assigned the average uncertainty of those 8 .",
    "there was no trend between distance and distance uncertainty .",
    "the bolometric luminosities were calculated using the observed spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of each source .",

    "these slopes may be smaller because of the way the cutoff was imposed . simply removing all points below a certain luminosity",

    "we choose to define the cutoff as a minimum line luminosity rather than infrared or bolometric luminosity .",
    "the motivation behind the cutoff is to define a minimum mass which we have constrained from the observed correlations between line luminosity and mass . krumholz and thompson ( 2007 ) claim that the cloud mass should exceed @xmath21000 @xmath3 to accomplish a decent sampling . using the correlation between l@xmath57 and m@xmath75",

    "based on the galactic l@xmath86-l@xmath57 correlations with no cutoff , this corresponds to bolometric ( or infrared ) luminosities of 10@xmath102 and 10@xmath103 for hco@xmath0 and hcn , respectively .",

    "2008 ) used 3d non - lte radiative transfer with hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies and galaxy mergers . despite considering two different classes of objects",
    ", the same explanation was reached by both .",
    "the origin of the sfr - l@xmath57 relation comes from the schmidt relationship and the density dependence of l@xmath57 .",
    "the schmidt relation says that the star formation rate is proportional to density to some power , or @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the schmidt index .",
    "the value of @xmath105 is 1.5 with one factor of @xmath106 coming from the mass available for stars and a factor of @xmath107 coming from the density dependence of the dynamical time for collapse ( madore 1977 , elmegreen 1994 ) .",
    "this assumes that star formation occurs at a constant rate per dynamical time . to predict the relation between sfr and line luminosity , @xmath108 the dependence of the line luminosity on density must be known",
    "this is expressed as @xmath109 so that the index of the sfr - l@xmath57 correlation is @xmath110=@xmath111 .    both simulations determined that density dependence of l@xmath57 fell into two regimes , one in which the critical density is much larger than the mean density of the gas and one in which it is much smaller .",
    "@xmath113 @xmath114 , only the high density tail of the density distribution is above the critical density so emission predominantly arises from the densest regions .",
    "the emission does not trace the density of the gas , but instead will trace the same density in every subcritical object . as density increases ( with n@xmath112 remaining much larger than @xmath114 )",
    ", the line emission rises superlinearly so that @xmath115 @xmath34 1 and @xmath110 @xmath93 n. the sfr - l@xmath57 relation will have an index below the schmidt index .",
    "both hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) and hcn",
    "( 1 - 0 ) fall in this regime . in the other case",
    "where n@xmath112 @xmath116 @xmath114 , nearly all of the gas is thermalized and emitting .",
    "the line luminosity faithfully traces the mass and rises linearly with density .",
    "the index of the sfr - l@xmath57 relation will approximately equal the schmidt index .",
    "( 1 - 0 ) produces an index near the schmidt index , which is consistent with this formulation as co traces lower densities than hco@xmath0 and hcn",
    ".    some combination of gas conditions and molecular transitions will be intermediate between the two cases .",
    "as density increases , the relation passes from the subcritical to the supercritical case , meaning the sfr - l@xmath57 relation should transition from linear to superlinear .",
    "evidence of this upturn have been found in observations , though it is only tentative due to a caveat to be discussed in the next subsection ( gao et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "a power law index of 1.0 was predicted for hcn ( 1 - 0 ) , in agreement with observations .",
    "the critical density of hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) is about a factor of 3 higher than that of hcn ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "gas tracers have critical densities that span several orders of magnitude , so the difference in n@xmath112 for the two tracers considered here is relatively small and they can be considered to trace the same conditions . based on the theoretical predictions , the index for hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) should also be near 1.0 .",
    "the results presented in this paper are consistent with the theoretical predictions of krumholz & thompson and narayanan et al .",
    "the interpretation that a linear relation means a constant ratio between the sfr and dense gas mass can not be distinguished from the theoretical predictions based on our work .",
    "the l@xmath86-l@xmath57 relation is intended to represent a relation between the sfr and gas mass .",
    "however , the conversions are complicated by a wide range of assumptions which must be explored .",
    "bolometric ( or infrared ) luminosity is the most popular measure of the star formation rate ( sfr ) as it is easy to determine . on scales from 1 kpc to galactic scales ,",
    "the imf of stars is well sampled and the conversion from @xmath80 to sfr is linear ( see kennicutt 1998 ) . however",
    ", this conversion for galaxies is potentially confounded by the presence of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which contribute their own ir emission by heating dust grains ( andreani et al .",
    "2003 , carilli et al .",
    "2005 , li et al .",
    "the extra observed ir flux can lead to an overestimate of the sfr .",
    "the effect of agn on the l@xmath86-l@xmath57 correlation is expected to be negligible . for a sample of 68 ulirgs , about 85 @xmath117 of the infrared luminosity",
    "was found to be powered by star formation with only 15 @xmath117 attributable to agn ( nardini et al .",
    "2008 ) . while agn occur more frequently in more ir - luminous galaxies ( e.g. , veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ) , their fractional contribution to the total bolometric luminosity mostly remain small .",
    "the net effect on the l@xmath86-l@xmath57 relation was tested in juneau et al .",
    "( 2009 ) by comparing the slopes obtained when using either the total infrared luminosity ( l@xmath95 ) or the far - infrared luminosity ( l@xmath118 ) as a proxy for l@xmath86 .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity is expected to be dominated by star formation even in the presence of agn - heated dust emission , which peak in the mid - infrared .",
    "in contrast , the total infrared emission is more subject to agn contamination .",
    "however , the l@xmath86-l@xmath57 relation is unchanged when substituting l@xmath95 for l@xmath118 , suggesting that possible agn contributions do not affect the relation ( at least within the uncertainties ) .    while galactic clumps will not be affected by agn",
    ", their @xmath80 also is not a perfect measure of the sfr .",
    "the most massive stars in a system younger than @xmath23 myr will not have had time to evolve and die in a supernova ; therefore , not enough time has elapsed to achieve equilibrium between stellar birth and death .",
    "in this situation , the light emitted will not trace the star formation rate .",
    "a simulation run by krumholz and tan ( 2007 ) found that the luminosity per unit star formation is insensitive to the age for populations older than a few myr ( which is a timescale that is easily averaged over 1 kpc within a galaxy but would not necessarily apply on the scale of an individual galactic clump ) .",
    "the luminosity of younger populations traced mass , but not the star formation rate .",
    "dividing the mass by an independent measure of the age to estimate the star formation rate does not solve the problem for systems younger than @xmath21 myr because not all of the stars in such a system have finished collapsing .",
    "these pre - main sequence stars are powered by accretion and will release more energy than a main sequence star of the same mass . since the contribution of these collapsing objects is unknown , it is impossible to determine how much mass is in the system ( krumholz and tan 2007 ) . by resolving the infrared population in galactic clumps ( e.g. , with james webb space telescope or large binocular telescope interferometer ) and directly comparing the mass distribution within the clumps ( e.g. with alma ) , we may be able to better constrain the actual sfr in galactic clumps .",
    "chemical variations potentially make the utility of hcn and hco@xmath0 questionable as uniform dense gas tracers in different environments .",
    "the strong x - ray emission from an agn can increase ionization and therefore the abundance of hcn in relation to other molecules ( lintott & viti 2006 ) .",
    "this is the explanation given for the trend observed in the hcn(1 - 0)/hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) luminosity ratio which increases with increasing far - infrared luminosity for l@xmath118 @xmath34 10@xmath94 @xmath47 by graci - carpio et al .",
    "however , another interpretation is that more luminous galaxies have a higher dense gas fraction and the effects on hcn chemistry are negligible . using 5 transitions from 3 molecules ( hcn , hco@xmath0 , co ) to form 10 line luminosity ratios ( with the higher critical density tracer in the numerator ) , juneau et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed that the ratios consistently increased with l@xmath95 except for the hco@xmath0(3 - 2)/hcn(1 - 0 ) ratio which combines the two tracers considered here .",
    "this ratio , which has tracers of nearly the same critical density , was approximately constant . using the same simulation as narayanan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the line ratio behavior was replicated without including chemical abundance changes .",
    "they concluded the dense gas fraction increased with luminosity and that inclusion of chemical effects in the dense gas were not necessary .",
    "molecular gas tracers are supposed to indicate the presence of molecular gas through collisions , emitting more energy when they undergo more collisions .",
    "ideally , all emission would be a result of interactions with the gas , but the emission can be affected by the background radiation .",
    "the excitation of hcn lines may be enhanced by ir pumping of a 14 @xmath31 m vibrational transition ( graci - carpio et al .",
    "similarly , hco@xmath0 excitation can be affected by a 12 @xmath31 m vibrational transition .",
    "any emission associated with radiative pumping will lead overestimates of the gas mass inferred from the line luminosity .",
    "the complications discussed above present real obstacles to interpreting the l@xmath86-l@xmath57 relation .",
    "none of them were included in the gmc or galaxy radiative transfer modeling because of the high degree of complexity that each would require .",
    "it is argued in both krumholz and thompson ( 2007 ) and narayanan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that their ability to replicate the relations for different tracers without accounting for these details shows that their effects may be negligible . despite these caveats , the results from this study show similar trends for the l@xmath86-l@xmath57 relation of hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) as was observed by wu et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2010 ) for hcn ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "we conclude that line luminosity in hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) is tracing mass as evidenced by the fits of l@xmath57 with isothermal mass and virial mass .",
    "m@xmath84 rises roughly linearly with l@xmath57 while m@xmath75 also increases with l@xmath57 , but with a sub - linear slope .",
    "the slope of the log(l@xmath86)-log(l@xmath57 ) relation for hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) is 1.04 @xmath27 0.02 ( 1.09 @xmath27 0.12 for galactic clumps and 0.81 @xmath27 0.21 for galaxies ) .",
    "this would imply a linear relation between the star formation rate and the mass of dense gas , though this interpretation is subject to several caveats .",
    "a similar result was seen by gao and solomon ( 2004 ) and wu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) using hcn ( 1 - 0 ) , a tracer with similar conditions for excitation as hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) .",
    "those results were tested using the bayesian linear regression routine . considering all sources with l@xmath95 exceeding 10@xmath96 @xmath47 ,",
    "the slope is 0.99 @xmath27 0.01 ( 1.17 @xmath27 0.11 for galactic clumps and 1.07 @xmath27 0.06 for galaxies ) .",
    "the results of our work are generally consistent with theoretical predictions from radiative transfer models .",
    "two different models , one considering gmcs ( krumholz and thompson 2007 ) and one considering isolated galaxies and galaxy mergers ( narayanan et al .",
    "2008 ) , predicted that the slope of the log(l@xmath86)-log(l@xmath57 ) relation should depend on the critical density of the tracer and the mean density of the gas .",
    "if the critical density is above the mean gas density , then only high density peaks are thermalized and emit . in this case",
    ", the line luminosity rises super - linearly with density and the log(l@xmath86)-log(l@xmath57 ) relation is linear .",
    "if the critical density of the tracer is below the mean gas density , then nearly all the gas is traced and the line luminosity faithfully traces the gas , rising linearly with density .",
    "this leads to a super - linear l@xmath86-l@xmath57 relation .",
    "both models predict a roughly linear relation for hcn ( 1 - 0 ) and since hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) is excited in similar conditions , it should behave similarly .",
    "the conversion of l@xmath86 to sfr has many caveats .",
    "it can be confounded by the presence of agn boosting the luminosity by heating dust grains or radiatively pumping the gas tracers to cause excess line emission .",
    "uncertainty in the age of the stellar populations and in the ability to sample the imf plague galactic clumps . ultimately , high resolution mid - infrared and submillimeter observations are needed to resolve embedded infrared populations and dense gas cores in galactic clumps to reliably determine the sfr .",
    "all of these caveats must be considered and characterized before the underlying star formation relation can be fully understood .",
    "our study suffered from a small number of galaxies mapped in hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) as only 14 were available ( graci - carpio et al .",
    "a more complete survey must be conducted to extend the sparsely populated moderate luminosity region of the l@xmath86-l@xmath57 plot toward l@xmath86 @xmath93 10@xmath94 @xmath47 .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the relation between the star formation rate ( sfr ) and mass of dense gas in galactic clumps and nearby galaxies . using the bolometric luminosity as a measure of sfr and the molecular line luminosity of hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) as a measure of dense gas mass , we find that the relation between sfr and m@xmath1 is approximately linear . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to published results derived using hcn ( 1 - 0 ) as a dense gas tracer . </S>",
    "<S> hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) and hcn ( 1 - 0 ) have similar conditions for excitation . </S>",
    "<S> our work includes 16 galactic clumps that are in both the bolocam galactic plane survey and the red msx survey , 27 water maser sources from the literature , and the aforementioned hcn ( 1 - 0 ) data . </S>",
    "<S> our results agree qualitatively with predictions of recent theoretical models which state that the nature of the relation should depend on how the critical density of the tracer compares with the mean density of the gas . </S>"
