    "after all , we expect that both dynamics , the non - markovian and the markovian ones to both have the same asymptotic state .",
    "but we still face with a natural and important question to answer : for a given set of model parameters representing the system and the thermal bath to which it is coupled to , for how long can we expect the memory effects due to the non - markovian terms to be important and when can they be neglected and then the dynamics be well represented by the local eq .",
    "( [ glelocal ] ) ?",

    "( [ glelocal ] ) represents a considerable simplification , for both a numerical point of view , or for analytical analysis ( when it is possible ) , when compared , e.g. , to the full nonlocal , integro - differential stochastic eq .",
    "( [ gle ] ) , this then becomes an important question to be accessed for most practical studies that make use of stochastic equations of motion .",

    "( [ glelocal ] ) .",
    "all our simulations were performed with @xmath54 realizations over the noise and we have integrated all differential equations using a standard fourth - order runge - kutta method with a time stepsize varying between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which were found to be more than enough for both numerical stability and also for enough numerical precision ( as determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , these values already assure an overall numerical error of always smaller than about one percent , which suffices for our comparison purposes set here ) .",
    "in all our simulations we have also used the initial conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the time in all our evolutions is in units of the ( inverse of the ) frequency for the system ( which is equivalent to consider @xmath59 throughout ) .",
    "comparisons between the markovian and non - markovian dynamics are made varying the relevant parameters of the bath for the two cases of kernels considered , while keeping the system parameters fixed .",

    "we include the study of how the dynamics changes with the temperature because this is useful to determine how this internal property of the thermal bath influences the dynamics when comparing to both the markovian and non - markovian cases .",
    "we start our analysis by first considering variations in the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "representative values for @xmath27 are then chosen and all the remaining parameters are initially kept fixed . note that since @xmath27 acts as damping the effects of the nonlocal kernels , the larger is @xmath27 the better must be the local approximation for the full nonlocal dynamics . then we keep @xmath27 fixed at the largest value used in our analysis and then consider variations in the other parameters .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] is clear and well within the expected : the larger is the relaxation time ( @xmath63 ) for the nonlocal kernels , the larger are the memory effects , resulting in a strong difference with respect to the local approximation , seen most notably at short times .",

    "this is also seen if we had plotted the correlation @xmath64 for both ou and edh cases .",
    "the difference between the markovian and non - markovian dynamics can also be better estimated by defining the quantities ,    @xmath65    the results for the differences @xmath66 and @xmath67 are shown in figs .",

    "an immediate conclusion we can realize from an inspection of the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] - [ fig4 ] is that the time scale that it takes for the two dynamics to begin to be equivalent is much larger than the time scale for the kernel relaxation itself , @xmath63 , and also larger than the typical system s time scale , which is typically given by the inverse of the system s frequency ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this will remain true for the multiplicative noise case with either the ou or the edh memory kernels .",
    "let us now verify the results concerning the markovian and non - markovian stochastic equations when multiplicative noise and system dependent dissipation are concerned .",

    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] , for the ou and edh cases , respectively .",
    "the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] - [ fig8 ] again indicate that , as expected and similar to the additive noise @xmath19 case , that the two dynamics , local and nonlocal , become closer to each other the larger is the kernel damping parameter .",
    "they also seem to indicate that in the multiplicative noise case the two dynamics are closer to each other for the same parameters used in the additive noise case . this can be more quantitatively estimated through the differences ( [ deltas ] ) .",
    "the results for the time scales when the two dynamics begin to be sufficiently close to each other are also presented in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "[ fig13 ] and table [ tab5 ] we can note that the smaller is the frequency of the thermal bath the larger it takes for both @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the non - markovian case to approach the markovian approximation . as the frequency of the bath",
    "is increased beyond the frequency of the system , the time scale for the non - markovian dynamics to approach the markovian one tends to decrease , but it also rapidly reaches a point where larger frequencies for the bath would not make the markovian approximation to improve too much .",
    "the results are seen to be much different again when the thermalization of the system is studied . from the thermalization plots seen in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] and the thermalization times given in table [ tab6 ] , we see that smaller frequencies for the bath , compared to the system s frequency , lead to much higher thermalization times for the non - markovian approximation compared to the markovian one .",
    "the thermalization time for the non - markovian dynamics is seen to decrease with an increase of @xmath29 , except the multiplicative noise case , where above a certain point @xmath73 , the thermalization time starts to increase again .",
    "though the importance of the memory kernel is expected to be less important the larger is @xmath29 , which makes it fast oscillate , the behavior in the multiplicative noise is probably far less simple , because the higher are the nonlinearities in that case , which are brought by the system dependent dissipation and noise .",
    "in this work we have analyzed in details the differences between the dynamics of a system when treating it in terms of its full non - markovian equation of motion and when expressing it in terms of its markovian , or local approximated form .",
    "having set the appropriate description for the non - markovian equations , we have then studied the applicability of the local approximation for these equations .",
    "we here have concentrated in two forms for the non - markovian memory kernel : the ou and edh cases and we have analyzed the cases of additive and multiplicative noises in both cases .",
    "we have seen that in general , for most of the parameters in both cases , the local approximation is far from being to represent a good description of the dynamics .",
    "obviously , since these are all dissipative systems , we expect the two dynamics , non - markovian and markovian , to tend to each other asymptotically .",
    "we have then analyzed how long it takes for each of the non - markovian dynamics studied to tend to the markovian ones .",
    "we have analyzed both the time for the system variable , @xmath74 , as well for the equal time correlation , @xmath72 .",
    "we have also analyzed the thermalization time for each of the dynamics by studying the behavior of the correlation function @xmath75 , which , according to the equipartition theorem , can be associated to the temperature of equilibration of the system .",
    "each of the dynamics were investigated by changing the main parameters characterizing the thermal bath : the damping term for the memory kernels , @xmath27 , the temperature @xmath13 and the frequency @xmath29 of the thermal bath .",
    "the parameters of the system were kept fixed for convenience as well the magnitude of the dissipation , @xmath4 , which is a linear parameter entering in all the dynamics and that was kept fixed at the point where all the dynamics were initially underdamped . by increasing @xmath27 ,",
    "the memory kernels are damped faster and the markovian approximation tends to be better as expected . as @xmath27 is varied , besides the expected behavior of the non - markovian dynamics to approach faster the markovian one the larger is the @xmath27 , it is also observed that for the same value for the memory kernel damping term , in general the cases with edh non - markovian dynamics tend to approach faster to the markovian dynamics than the ou cases , as far the thermalization times in each of the dynamics are concerned . it is also observed that in general the markovian dynamics tend to overestimate the time for thermalization as compared to the time it takes in the non - markovian cases .",
    "the thermalization times in the studied dynamics also tend to be larger in the multiplicative noise cases than in the additive ones .",
    "when analyzing the behavior of each of the dynamics when varying the temperature and frequency of the thermal bath , we have fixed the value of @xmath27 and then investigated each of the time scales for non - markovian dynamics for @xmath74 and @xmath72 to approach the corresponding markovian approximation .",
    "by increasing the temperature it is observed that the markovian approximation tends to improve , except in the case of the dynamics of the correlation @xmath72 in the edh case with additive noise , where the markovian approximation tends to worsen and in the ou additive noise case , where the dynamics is weakly dependent on the temperature of the thermal bath .",
    "these results seem to indicate that the effective dissipation in the other dynamics is dependent on the temperature of the thermal bath , in particular in the multiplicative noise cases , where the effective dissipation seems to increase much faster with the temperature than in the additive noise cases .",
    "the thermalization times shown in table [ tab4 ] are also indicative of this behavior .",
    "finally , in the study of how the frequency of the thermal bath affects the dynamics ( in the edh memory kernel cases ) , we have seen that as the frequency of the thermal bath is increased , the markovian approximation seems to improve till some frequency close to the system s frequency . above that value",
    "there is little improvement .",
    "we have also verified that for frequencies of the thermal bath much below the system s one , the markovian approximation worsens considerably .",
    "a few generic results can also be drawn from the analysis of all cases studied here .",
    "in particular , we can note from the obtained results that either the local approximation underestimates the effective dissipation seen in the non - markovian dynamics , or overestimates it in most of the regions of parameters .",
    "the local ( markovian ) approximation for the dynamics tends to be better at larger values of the bath damping term @xmath27 and for larger values of the frequency @xmath29 and temperature @xmath13 of the thermal bath ( except for the correlation @xmath72 in the case of edh memory kernel with additive noise ) .",
    "the difference between the dynamics is larger at short times , exactly as expected because of the finite memory times for the non - markovian equations .",
    "the different simulations we have performed with different bath parameters allowed us to estimate the approximate time scales when the markovian approximation may become an appropriate description of the dynamics .",
    "in general , this time scale is much larger in the multiplicative noise cases than in the additive noise ones .",
    "also , given the specific differences seen in each of the dynamics when varying e.g. either @xmath27 , @xmath13 or @xmath29 , by looking at these differences when changing the properties of the thermal bath may be a useful way to discriminate possible stochastic phenomena in nature and to tell whether they can be dominated by additive or multiplicative noises .",
    "finally , we should point out the possible connection and relevance of our studies with those related to the dynamics of field theory models .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that non - markovian kernels of the same form as studied here can also appear in the studies of the effective dynamics of an order parameter in field theories and in cosmology in general .",
    "since the studies of dissipative processes in those applications are related to time non - local terms in the effective evolution equation of the system , for example , for a background scalar field describing the system , or an order parameter for a phase transition problem , we expect our results to be of relevance for understanding the relevant dynamics in those situations as well",
    ". in particular , our studies may be useful to clarify the applicability or not of approximating the dynamics in those problems as local ones , as usually it is considered to be the case there .",
    "the results we have obtained here shows that , in many cases , the local approximation is not a reliable description of the true non - markovian dynamics",
    ". the difference can be very large at short times and continue to be for long time scales , with memory effects making a strong contribution for the dynamics .",
    "this may have strong consequences , for example , when studying thermalization and equilibration times in phase transition problems , or in the problem of the production of particles and radiation in cosmology . in the dynamics of some systems in contact with a thermal bath , as we have seen in the studies performed in this work , the usual local langevin equation typically underestimates the thermalization with respect to the true dynamics , indicating that the use of local approximated forms for the study of the dynamics can be unappropriated and even lead to erroneous results as regarding to the system s equilibration and thermalization time scales .",
