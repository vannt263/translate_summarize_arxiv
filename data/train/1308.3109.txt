    "in recent decades , advances in nanotechnology , semiconductor device fabrication and micro - fabrication techniques have thrown open the rich field of two dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) @xcite .",
    "there is a special focus on systems with confinement along all three spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "several experiments aimed at understanding the electronic @xcite and optical properties @xcite of such systems , commonly referred to as quantum dot @xcite , have been undertaken @xcite . in some of these experiments",
    "the quantum dots are exposed to magnetic fields of varying strength and their response is studied in terms of electron transport and inter - band tunneling properties @xcite .    a reasonable model to describe such non - relativistic quantum dot systems requires a parabolic quantum well as the confining potential @xcite . however , theoretical exploration of such models is far from exhaustive and presents several potential situations for study .",
    "one such aspect is the response of a charged particle confined to a quantum well in an applied magnetic field @xcite and constrained to a surface with non - trivial geometry .",
    "an often studied topological defect is a conical disclination @xcite , which has been the focus of quantum mechanical problems in curved space @xcite of the landau level type @xcite .",
    "another dimension of investigation @xcite looks into the thermodynamic properties of confined systems of the landau - fock - darwin @xcite type in ordinary euclidean space .",
    "these lines of examination can be brought to converge on the issue of thermodynamic behavior of single electron confined in the presence of a conical disclination , a situation which has the potency to reveal the physics of quantum dots with novel geometry .",
    "the presence of topological defects in the constraining surface is expected to affect the thermodynamic characteristics of such a system and their asymptotic behavior .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the properties exhibited by a charged particle constrained on a surface with a defect of the nature of conical disclination .",
    "the system comprises of the particle subjected to a magnetic field , while it is trapped in a parabolic fock - darwin potential .",
    "the approach is , to first calculate the energy spectrum and then use the canonical partition function to uncover the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "we have used the schrdinger equation to obtain the energy eigenspectrum .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that spectroscopic studies of electronic states of quantum dots ( such as insb quantum dot ) indicate that a schrdinger hamiltonian with a fock - darwin confining potential gives reasonable agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "we introduce a conical disclination defect in such systems through the volterra process @xcite ( discussed in the next section ) .",
    "the approach here borrows an idea from gravity , whereby the defect appears as a modification of geometry of the underlying space .",
    "we also note that a similar approach maybe adopted for graphene @xcite like 2d systems .",
    "however , the spectrum there is linear at the band minima and thereby the dirac hamiltonian has to be adopted .",
    "we have studied the variations of the thermodynamic quantities of interest like internal energy , specific heat and entropy with magnetic field , temperature and _ extent of the defect_. the asymptotic limits of these are checked for confirmation with expected results .",
    "the paper consists of four sections .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] is dedicated to developing the mathematical formalism .",
    "the defect is introduced as a modification of the metric from its otherwise euclidean form . beginning with a suitable choice of coordinates ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is constructed .",
    "the schrdinger equation is then solved for this hamiltonian to obtain the energy spectrum .",
    "this is followed by obtaining the various thermodynamic variables of the system using the canonical partition function .",
    "the expressions for these quantities are recast in terms of dimensionless parameters and their behavior is studied .",
    "the asymptotics are checked for consistency . in sec .",

    "the topological defect being introduced in the current study is a conical disclination .",
    "this entails a two - dimensional ( 2d ) conical space which is locally flat at all points except for the origin @xcite .",
    "the construction of this space is to be visualized as the consequence of cutting out a sector with a certain apex angle called the _ deficit angle _ , from the ordinary 2d flat space and subsequently welding together the newly revealed edges @xcite .",
    "the metric for such a space , in the usual polar coordinates @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 .",

    "the parameter @xmath5 is a measure of the deficit angle .",

    "hence , for @xmath13 we have negative curvature and for @xmath14 the curvature at origin is positive .",
