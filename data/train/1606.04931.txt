    "a permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) in a non - degenerate system would violate both parity inversion ( _ p _ ) and time reversal ( _ t _ ) symmetries .",

    "cp _ symmetry .",
    "measurements of edms in a wide variety of systems , such as the neutron @xcite , electron @xcite , and nuclei @xcite , place stringent limits on various sources of _ cp _ violation .",
    "for example , measurements of the neutron edm @xcite have traditionally been used to restrict the cp - violating parameter of quantum chromodynamics to be @xmath6 , whereas one would expect it to be of order unity @xcite .    identifying additional sources of _ cp _",
    "violation is essential to understanding how matter came to dominate over anti - matter in our universe .",
    "although the standard model ( sm ) includes _ cp _ violation observed in @xmath7 meson @xcite and @xmath8 meson @xcite decay , these mechanisms are unable to reproduce the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry @xcite .",
    "_ cp _ violation included in the sm predicts edms that are many orders of magnitude below current experimental limits such that observation of a non - zero edm in the foreseeable future would be a signature of new physics .",
    "the edm of a diamagnetic atom arises primarily from _ cp _ violating interactions in the nuclear medium .",
    "although atomic electrons screen these effects from observation in the lab frame , this screening is imperfect due to the finite size of the nucleus and relativistic electron motion .",
    "the portion of the nuclear edm that survives electron screening is characterized by the schiff moment @xcite .",
    "while the most precise edm measurement of a diamagnetic atom was performed on @xmath9hg @xcite , @xmath0ra  is a promising isotope for an edm search because octupole deformation of the @xmath0ra  nucleus enhances its edm by over two orders of magnitude compared to @xmath9hg @xcite .",
    "nuclear octupole deformation also simplifies edm calculations for @xmath0ra  making them more consistent compared to @xmath9hg @xcite .",
    "there are two primary obstacles to achieving an edm measurement in @xmath0ra .",
    "first , @xmath0ra  is radioactive with a 14.9 day half - life .",
    "this makes @xmath0ra  atoms scarce and difficult to handle .",
    "second , the vapor pressure of radium is too low to perform spin precession measurements in a vapor cell .",
    "fortunately , the atomic structure of @xmath0ra  allows us to circumvent these challenges using laser cooling and trapping .",
    "recently , we reported the first measurement of the @xmath0ra  edm @xcite , representing both the first edm measurement using an atom with an octupole deformed nucleus and the first edm measurement using laser - trapped atoms . although the @xmath3 confidence upper limit from this measurement is not yet competitive with that of @xmath10hg for limiting _",
    "violation in the nucleus according to current theoretical calculations @xcite , @xmath0ra  measurements have the potential to achieve rapid improvements by many orders of magnitude through a series of experimental upgrades . in this work ,",
    "we report the first such upgrade which allows us to improve the @xmath0ra  edm @xmath3 confidence upper limit by a factor of 36 to @xmath11 @xmath2 cm .",
    "the primary improvement over our previous measurement is an improved vacuum system and a new optical dipole trap ( odt ) @xcite geometry which prolongs the atom trap lifetime and allows us to extend spin precession measurements from 2 s to 20 s.    edms of hadronic systems ( neutrons , diamagnetic atoms and molecules ) can be described as a linear combination of several potential sources of cp violation .",
    "the traditional method used to interpret edm limits in these systems is to assume that the edm is generated by only one source .",
    "this approach provides a simple way to directly interpret an edm limit from a single system but fails to account for the scenario where an edm arises from multiple sources of cp violation .",
    "presently , experimental limits on edms of several systems have been reported and it is now possible to combine edm limits from these systems to simultaneously constrain multiple sources of cp violation @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "when the @xmath0ra  edm limit reaches @xmath12 @xmath2 cm , it will improve constraints on all cp violating interactions in the nuclear medium .",

    "section [ subsec : loading ] introduces the relevant atomic structure that allows us to manipulate radium atoms and describes the journey the atoms take through our apparataus from when they are loaded into the oven to when they arrive at the edm measurement region . here , we emphasize the changes and improvements since laser cooling and trapping of radium @xcite and odt transport of radium atoms @xcite were first demonstrated .",
    "section [ subsec : measurement ] describes the measurement procedure we use to interrogate the atoms after they arrive at the edm measurement region .",
    "our experiment operates cyclically such that each experimental `` cycle '' lasts 100 s. for each cycle , 60 s is spent preparing a new sample of atoms for interrogation and 40 s is spent interrogating the atoms using two separate 20 s precession measurements .",

    "the lifetime of the red transition is 420 ns which limits the photon scattering rate for this transition to 0.38 mhz .",
    "this is almost two orders of magnitude weaker than typical primary cooling transitions used in other alkaline - earth atoms with similar electronic structure ( e.g. sr , yb ) . while experiments that use these alkaline - earth atoms leverage the dipole - allowed @xmath17s@xmath18 to @xmath17p@xmath21 ( blue ) transition , this transition is especially cumbersome in radium because branching ratios from @xmath17p@xmath21 to @xmath23d@xmath24 and metastable @xmath25d@xmath26 states are so large that a complicated repumping scheme is necessary both for longitudinal slowing @xcite and magneto optical trap ( mot ) @xcite operation .",
    "in contrast , the red transition requires a single repump laser at 1428.6 nm which excites the @xmath25d@xmath27 to @xmath23p@xmath27 transition @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath0ra  from the national isotope development center at oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "our previous edm measurement combined two separate data runs which used 3 mci and 6 mci shipments of @xmath0ra  respectively @xcite . in the current measurement",
    ", we use a single 9 mci shipment , which equates to 225 ng of @xmath0ra .",

    "we dissolve the salt in a solution of nitric acid along with 4 @xmath28ci of @xmath29ra .",
    "we can selectively cool and trap either isotope independently and with no isotopic contamination by changing the frequency of the lasers we use to cool and trap atoms .",
    "we use @xmath29ra  ( @xmath30 y ) to setup and optimize the experimental apparatus since the greater abundance of this isotope allows us to load more atoms into the oven .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath29ra  has zero total angular momentum in its ground state since it lacks nuclear spin and thus , can not have an edm in the lab frame",
    ". the radium nitrate solution is deposited on a 2.5 cm square piece of aluminum foil and allowed to dry . before loading the foil into the oven ,",
    "we place two 25 mg granules of metallic barium on the foil and wrap the foil around the barium . the foil and two additional 25 mg granules of barium",
    "are then placed in the oven . with a sufficient vapor pressure of barium ,",
    "the radium nitrate and barium undergo an oxidation - reduction reaction to produce metallic radium .",
    "the heart of the oven assembly is a titanium crucible , in which we place the radium - coated foil and barium .",
    "atoms enter the vacuum chamber through a nozzle with a cylindrical opening that is 8.3 cm long and 0.15 cm in diameter .",
    "the back side of the crucible attaches to a vacuum flange via a stainless steel tube that is perforated to reduce heat conductance to the vacuum chamber .",
    "two radiative heaters made from tungsten filament coil surround the crucible and nozzle .",
    "we heat the oven to between @xmath31 c and @xmath32 c. during an edm measurement , the @xmath0ra  flux degrades due to oven depletion and radioactive decay .",
    "we gradually increase the oven temperature to maintain a constant @xmath0ra  flux .",
    "once the oven approaches @xmath32 c we notice a decrease in the trap lifetime and further increases in the oven temperature do not result in a useful increase in atom flux .",
    "three layers of in - vacuum passive heat shields surround the heaters inside a fourth layer of heat shielding that is water - cooled .",
    "transverse cooling @xcite of the atomic beam is achieved using 150 mw of near - resonant 714 nm laser light that is expanded to a @xmath332 cm beam diameter ( @xmath34 ) and split into two orthogonal beams propagating at near normal incidence to the atomic beam propagation direction ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the beams make multiple bounces between two pairs of 2.5 cm by 18 cm mirrors to increase their interaction time with atoms and improve collimation by slightly decreasing their angle with respect to the atomic beam normal after each reflection .",

    "this velocity class represents only @xmath36 of the atoms exiting our oven for a typical operating temperature of 500@xmath37 c.    slowed atoms are trapped in a mot which combines three orthogonal pairs of circularly polarized , counter - propagating laser beams with a quadrupole b - field to create a trapping potential .",
    "we operate the mot in three `` phases '' which are distinguished by the intensity and detuning of the mot laser beams and the b - field gradient we apply .",
    "the details of each phase have been described previously @xcite . during the first phase we set the beam intensity , frequency detuning , and b - field gradient to optimize loading atoms into the mot . after loading atoms for 50 s ,",
    "we decrease laser intensity and detuning while increasing b - field gradient to compress the atoms and image their fluorescence on a ccd camera .",
    "finally , we further decrease laser intensity and detuning to optimize cooling and loading the atoms into an odt .",
    "the mot is overlapped with the focus of a 50 w , 1550 nm laser beam ( transport beam ) . having a @xmath34 radius of 50 @xmath38 m at its focus , the transport beam forms an odt with a depth of @xmath33400 @xmath38k .",
    "the focus is formed using a 10 cm diameter lens with a focal length of 2 m. atoms are transferred to the transport beam with near unity efficiency in the final phase of the mot .",
    "after transfer is complete , we extinguish the mot laser beams and translate the focusing lens by approximately one meter to transfer the atoms from the mot chamber to the edm measurement region .",
    "optimum transfer efficiency occurs for a sinusoidal position versus time motion profile with a transport time of 9 s. previously , a 6 s transport time was used @xcite , however , improvements to the vacuum system reduced atom loss due to background gas collisions and created a new optimum transport time .",
    "the measurement region is located at the center of a 1.5 m long glass tube which extends from the mot chamber horizontally along @xmath39 . here",
    ", the atoms are compressed in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) mot along @xmath39 and transferred to a second odt based on a 20 w , linearly polarized , single mode 1550 nm laser with a 50 @xmath38 m @xmath34 radius at its focus ( the holding beam ) .",
    "this transfer procedure has been described in detail previously @xcite .",
    "after the atoms are transferred into the holding beam , the transport beam is extinguished along with all 714 nm laser light and the 1d mot coil loop circuit is electrically disconnected by a relay .",
    "the holding beam propagates along @xmath35 and is linearly polarized along @xmath39 . our previous edm measurements @xcite used a 10 w retro - reflected holding beam . the interference pattern generated by this previous geometry more tightly confines the atoms along @xmath35 .",
    "tighter confinement reduces sensitivity to some systematic effects , however , this geometry also reduces the trap lifetime to 10 s due to laser induced heating . with a non - retro - reflected 20 w holding beam ,",
    "we achieve a trap lifetime of @xmath3340 s. the increased sensitivity to systematic effects is not a concern in the current measurement .",

    "therefore , an accurate evaluation of their relative orientations is critical to estimating the importance of numerous systematic effects . for the current measurement ,",
    "a rough alignment of the applied fields based on the mechanical constraints of our apparatus is sufficient to suppress systematic effects to below the current level of statistical sensitivity ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : systematics ] ) . however , it is still necessary to accurately measure the orientation of the applied fields relative to each other to reliably estimate the magnitude of these effects .",
    "furthermore , ongoing upgrades to our measurement technique will enable @xmath0ra  edm measurements with a statistical sensitivity at the @xmath57 @xmath2 cm level .",

    "the following section describes our evaluation of the current field orientation and the method we will use to achieve the more stringent alignment requirements of future measurements with improved statistical sensitivity .    to evaluate the present field orientation , we use gravity ( @xmath58 ) and the projection of the glass tube in the horizontal plane ( @xmath39 ) as reference dimensions and measure the orientation of the fields relative to reference surfaces using a precision digital level with a national institute of standards and technology ( nist)-traceable calibration and 350 @xmath38rad absolute accuracy . the orientation of fields in the horizontal plane is determined using mechanical tolerances of the apparatus .",

    "we then determine the pitch and roll angles of the plate using a digital level .",
    "the probes measure the magnetic field along three orthogonal axes offset 5 cm along the @xmath41 axis from the location of the atoms . using the orientation of the mounting plate and the probes within the plate , we determine the direction of @xmath46 and use the measured gradient of the @xmath41 component of the b - field to estimate the uncertainty the 5 cm offset creates in our knowledge of the b - field direction at the atoms .",
    "the final uncertainty in the direction of @xmath46 is dominated by the manufacturer - specified uncertainty of the alignment of each probe within its sealed housing .",
    "the holding beam is mechanically constrained , by aperture in the magnetic shields , to propagate along @xmath35 to within @xmath60 rad in any one direction .",
    "the polarizer that determines the polarization of the holding beam is referenced to a laser table surface which is level to better than 0.001 rad such that @xmath53 is along @xmath39 with an uncertainty that is determined by the uncertainty in @xmath50 .",
    "this gives that the polarization vector is constrained to the @xmath35-@xmath39 plane to within @xmath61 rad since it requires coupled misalignment of the holding beam in two dimensions .",
    "in future measurements , it is possible to align the applied fields to within of 0.002 rad of their design orientation using commercial products to evaluate the field alignment and the current capabilities of the experimental apparatus to adjust field orientations .",
    "using an autocollimator to optically evaluate in - vacuum surface orientations , we can determine the orientation of our electrode spacer , and thus , our applied e - field , relative to a level surface . using trim and gradient coils that are already implemented in our apparatus , we can then measure and adjust the orientation of the applied b - field to be parallel to the e - field using commercial 3-axis fluxgate magnetometers with sufficiently accurate orientation and orthogonality specifications for the three fluxgate magnetic field probes . finally , we can orient the propagation direction of our holding beam to be parallel to a surface that is normal to the applied e - field using irises with precise heights mounted to this surface . in this scheme , the e - field will define the @xmath41 axis while the holding beam will define the @xmath35 axis .",

    "our blue laser has circular polarization and co - propagates with the holding beam along @xmath35 .",
    "we adjust the polarization purity to be greater than @xmath63 at a polarimeter that samples the beam after it has passed through the vacuum chamber .",
    "the circularly polarized blue laser is used to both polarize and detect the atoms . to polarize the atoms",

    "after 1/2 of a precession period , we say that the atoms are in the `` bright '' state , because their probability to scatter a photon from the blue laser is maximal .",
    "an atom excited by the blue laser has a 2/3 probability to decay to the bright state and a 1/3 probability to decay to the dark state , thus , we can scatter a maximum of 3 photons per atom on average .    for atom detection , the collimated blue laser and the shadow cast by atoms scattering photons out of the laser",

    "spatial fluctuations of the laser beam intensity are limited only by photon shot noise such that pixels that detect on average n photons will have fluctuations of @xmath82 . however , scattering from dust or other imperfections in the beam path and multiple reflection paths that interfere with the main transmitted beam all create distortions to the intensity profile of our blue laser that can change on timescales of several seconds .    in order to properly interpret the images",
    ", we remove these distortions using 5 background images taken before the atoms arrive and 20 background images taken after they have been dropped .",

    "we create new weighting images approximately once every 24 hours to accommodate long - term drifts in the position of the holding beam .",
    "since the snr of each individual @xmath0ra  shadow image is low , we average shadow magnitudes from multiple experimental cycles for each detection image .",
    "this procedure involves binning the data and determining an uncertainty for each bin based on the scatter of shadow magnitudes within each bin . in collecting data into bins ,",
    "we aim to compromise between minimizing the statistical uncertainty and accounting for slow drifts in the experimental conditions .",
    "a detailed account of this procedure can be found in appendix [ appendix : averaging ] .",
    "the probability to scatter photons out of the blue laser is maximal for the bright state and minimal for the dark state , so the shadow magnitude is proportional to the bright state population fraction .",
    "however , the shadow magnitude is also proportional to the number of atoms in the trap during the image . to eliminate fluctuations in the signal size due to fluctuations in atom number , we divide the averaged shadow magnitude from image 2(4 ) by the corresponding average shadow magnitude from image 3(5 ) .",
    "this value is equal to the bright state population fraction because the atoms in image 3(5 ) are all in the bright state . for each e - field condition and @xmath70 that we measure in the experiment",

    "however , there are several major experimental upgrades under development that can dramatically improve future measurements of the @xmath0ra  edm .",
    "one limiting aspect of the current experiment is the small number of photons per atom that scatter out of the detection laser . on average ,",
    "it is possible to get 3 photons per atom before an atom decays to the dark state .",
    "with so few photons scattered , it is unsurprising that the current measurement is limited by photon shot noise in the detection laser .",
    "an increase in the number of photons scattered per atom would increase the signal size proportionally . since laser photon shot noise is the dominant noise source ,",
    "increasing the signal size does not increase noise until we become limited by quantum projection noise ( qpn ) , a fundamental source of noise resulting from projecting a quantum superposition state onto one of the basis states . in this measurement ,",
    "the laser light is either scattered out of the beam or not , corresponding to projecting the atom into either the bright or dark state , respectively .",
    "we can use the @xmath97 , @xmath19 to @xmath141 , @xmath224 ( blue cycling ) transition to detect atom number , which can scatter up to 1000 photons per atom on average before the atoms decay to a long - lived metastable state .",
    "however , both the dark and bright nuclear spin states scatter light resonant on this transition so although this state is useful for detecting atom number , it can not directly detect spin precession . in future measurements , we plan to implement a nuclear - spin - dependent coherent transfer to the metastable @xmath25d@xmath27 state using stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to detect spin precession using the blue cycling transition and improve the statistical sensitivity of an edm measurement by over an order of magnitude .    with each atom contributing more signal to the measurement , the remaining fundamental limit to the statistical sensitivity of our experiment will then be qpn .",
    "sensitivity to an edm is greatest if we measure for phase shifts in larmor precession when the slope of population fraction versus precession time is greatest .",
    "this corresponds to interrogating the atoms when they are in an equal superposition of the bright and dark states .",
    "the qpn associated with projecting this state onto either the bright or dark state is proportional to the square root of the atom number while the signal is proportional to the atom number .",
    "thus , the statistical sensitivity of our measurement improves as the square root of the number of atoms we interrogate .    in future measurements",
    ", we can significantly gain in statistical sensitivity by increasing the number of atoms we interrogate by many orders of magnitude .",
    "first , we can address the disparity between the velocity of atoms exiting the oven and the capture velocity of the zeeman slower by developing a longitudinal slower based on the blue cycling transition . although it is straightforward to design a variable magnetic field for atom deceleration with the blue cycling transition , keeping the three necessary repump lasers on resonance throughout the slower will add additional complexity to the slower operation because their zeeman shifts are not matched to that of the blue cycling transition .",
    "effective atom slowing based on this transition is currently being developed using chirped frequency ramps rather than a variable magnetic field , a technique first demonstrated with sodium atoms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as new isotope production capabilities begin operation , the amount of @xmath0ra  that we load into the oven can be substantially increased . in the near future ,",
    "efforts within the national isotope development center to produce more @xmath0ac for the medical industry will also produce more @xmath0ra .",
    "further in the future , efforts to harvest rare isotopes produced at the upcoming facility for rare isotope beams @xcite have the potential to provide several orders of magnitude more @xmath0ra  than current production methods .",
    "in addition to improvements in atom detection and increases in atom number , we are also fabricating new electrodes to achieve higher e - fields .",
    "the current electrodes initially demonstrated a peak e - field of 100 kv / cm but now routinely only produce 65 kv / cm .",
    "in contrast , other groups have demonstrated titanium electrodes that produce 800 kv / cm with no dark current using standard surface preparation techniques and a similar geometry to the current electrodes @xcite .    in the qpn limited regime ,",
    "a simple estimation for the statistical sensitivity of an edm measurement is given by @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the standard error of the edm measurement , @xmath98 is the magnitude of the applied e - field , @xmath99 is the precession time , @xmath227 is the number of atoms , and @xmath228 is the total measurement time . an attractive route to achieving a statistical sensitivity of @xmath4 @xmath2 cm is to leverage new cooling and slowing techniques based on the blue transition and increases in the amount of available @xmath0ra   such that we increase the number of interrogated atoms from 500 to @xmath229 atoms . with improved electrodes , we would then need to achieve a field of 150 kv / cm to reach @xmath4 @xmath2 cm with an integration time of 60 days .    the combination of improving atom detection , increasing atom number , and increasing e - field strength form a solid framework for future @xmath0ra  edm measurements that are many orders of magnitude more precise than the current results . furthermore , there are no known systematic effects that would prohibit a measurement at this level . taking into account the unique sensitivity",
