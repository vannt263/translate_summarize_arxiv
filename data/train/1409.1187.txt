    "ever since the discovery of above - threshold ionization ( ati ) @xcite , the energy spectrum of the electrons ejected from atoms or ions exposed to an intense laser pulse has proved rich in interesting features @xcite .",
    "these include the suppression of the lowest ati peaks in long pulses , which arises from the ponderomotive acceleration of the outgoing electron @xcite , prominent stark - shift induced resonances in short pulses @xcite , the recollision plateau , which extends the spectrum well beyond the classical cutoff for direct ionization @xcite , and the low energy and very low energy structures recently found in ionization by ultrashort infrared pulses @xcite .",
    "the theory of multiphoton ionization has progressed in parallel with these discoveries , through a combination of _ ab initio _ time - dependent calculations and of analyses based on the strong field approximation ( sfa ) or on the floquet theory and other approaches @xcite .",
    "of particular note in the context of the present work is keldysh s theory @xcite , a length - gauge formulation of the sfa which , since its inception fifty years ago , has been at the basis of a large fraction of the theoretical work on strong field physics .",
    "this formulation predicts accurate ionization probabilities for detachment from negative ions @xcite .",
    "it is also both qualitatively and quantitatively correct for ionization from atoms , provided the coulomb interaction between the active electron and the residual ion is properly taken into account @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study another feature of ionization in intense ultra - short laser pulses , namely an almost periodic modulation marking the angle - integrated energy spectrum in appropriate conditions of pulse duration , peak intensity and carrier - envelope phase .",
    "although this modulation is readily found both in sfa calculations and in _ ab initio _ calculations , we are not aware that it has been discussed previously @xcite . however , like various other strong field phenomena , it can be traced , through the sfa , to the interplay between different saddle times of the modified classical action .",
    "we concentrate on the low energy end of the ionization spectrum , where this modulation is clearest .",
    "as is well known , this part of the spectrum is dominated by direction ionization .",
    "recollision of the detached electron with the residual ion plays no role here , and is therefore neglected in our analysis .",
    "the theoretical background to the work is outlined in section [ sect : theory ] .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section [ sect : results ] .",
    "technical issues concerning the calculation of the ionization amplitude within the sfa are briefly considered in the appendix  namely avoiding the spurious contributions made to the ionization amplitude by the end points of the integral defining it , computational methods bypassing saddle point integration , and improving the accuracy of the usual ( second order ) saddle point method .",
    "atomic units are assumed throughout this article , except where specified otherwise .",

    "we noticed that this method is considerably faster than a trapezoidal quadrature of a same degree of accuracy for the intense pulses considered in much of this work .",
