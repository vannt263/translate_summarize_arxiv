    "owing to new sky surveys , the number of known dwarf galaxies or dwarf galaxy candidates that reside within the local group has doubled over the last very few years @xcite .",
    "these new discoveries have extended the realm of galaxies to objects @xmath5 times fainter than were known before . this enlarged population of extremely dim satellites is bringing us closer to an ( at least ) partial solution to the apparent overproduction of dark matter sub - halos in cosmological simulations of milky way ( mw ) and m31-like systems @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by the spectroscopic surveys of these objects and measurement of their velocity dispersions that require them to be among the most dark matter dominated objects known to date @xcite .",
    "although some satellite candidates are still being searched for and proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most mw satellites within the reach of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have probably been discovered @xcite .",
    "more and more effort is now spent on trying to understand whether these systems reflect the faint end of the dwarf galaxy luminosity function , whether they are disrupted versions of their brighter siblings or whether they are entirely different objects @xcite .",
    "but as these studies are based on the observed properties of these systems , it is important to quantify their structural parameters or luminosities rigorously , given their often low number of stars ( a few tens to a few hundreds down to the sdss flux limit ) .    as a simple comparison , both botes  i ( booi ) and draco ( dra ) are systems containing mainly ( if not only ) metal - poor and old stars , at similar distances from us ( @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 ) , yet their difference in luminosity ( @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 ) means that the number of stars observable in booi is roughly 10% that of draco under similar observing conditions",
    "nevertheless , for the faint satellites , parameters are usually derived with the same techniques that are used for their brighter counterparts . in particular , the structural parameters are mainly derived by assuming spherical symmetry or through the intensity - weighted second moments technique ( see e.g. @xcite for a description ) .",
    "but in faint galaxies , this technique requires some smoothing to produce maps that are not dominated by shot - noise and on which the method can be applied reliably .",
    "the impact of any such smoothing scheme ( pixel size , smoothing kernel size , threshold over which pixels are used ) on the recovered parameters has not been investigated extensively .",
    "in addition , the ` total magnitude ' of extremely faint stellar systems is conceptually not well defined since this parameter is usually determined from the luminosity of individual stars .",
    "this is perfectly valid when thousands of stars provide a good sampling of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , but as the cmd becomes more sparsely populated in faint satellites , the recovered luminosity can be affected by the stellar evolution state of individual stars , in particular how many of them are close to the tip of the red giant branch . in willman  1 ( wil1 )",
    "single stars could have a strong but transient impact on the luminosity of the system , currently estimated at @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the extent to which the seemingly distorted shapes of most of these new systems [ e.g. botes  i ( booi , @xcite ) , cvni ( @xcite ) , coma berenices ( com , @xcite ) , hercules ( her , @xcite ) , ursa major  ii ( umaii , @xcite ) and wil1 ( @xcite ) ] are intrinsic or a reflection of the few stars available to map them also warrants close scrutiny",
    ".    therefore , we set out to re - derive the structural parameters ( centroid , half - light radius , ellipticity , position angle ) and luminosities of the newly discovered mw satellites through a maximum likelihood ( ml ) algorithm .",
    "this algorithm has the advantage of directly fitting the best stellar density model to the data  the positions of individual stars  without any need for smoothing .",
    "moreover , one of its outputs is the actual number of stars present in each system , down to the sdss depth , which we can then use to determine its expected magnitude .",
    "this latter value then accounts for the scatter that is induced by the individual evolution of member stars .",
    "finally , we use the best fit structural models to test whether shot - noise alone can explain the seemingly irregular shape of smoothed stellar density maps , or whether they deviate enough from these best models to require clumpiness in their underlying distribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : ",
    "2 describes the maximum likelihood algorithm and presents its results applied to sdss data .",
    "we also analyze discrepancies with previous estimates of the ellipticity of some systems . in   3 we study the impact of the sparseness of the systems on their absolute magnitude while the search for deviations from the best model is explained in ",
    "4 . finally",
    ", we use   5 for a discussion of the ensuing homogeneous dataset of morphological parameters and consider possible scenarios that could explain the higher characteristic ellipticity found in the faintest half of the milky way dwarf galaxies .",
    "  6 concludes this paper .",
    "while the approach of estimating structural parameters for stellar systems directly from a star catalog via a maximum likelihood fit is in principle established ( e.g. @xcite ) , it has not been used very widely .",
    "therefore , we recapitulate the approach here and spell out our particular implementation .",
    "we start by presuming that the observables , in our case the positions of stars in the sdss , have been drawn from a ( spatial ) model distribution that is described by @xmath11 model parameters , @xmath12 .",
    "the goal of the well - known ml technique ( e.g. @xcite ) is to find the set of parameters @xmath13 for which the observations become most likely .",
    "this means maximizing the @xmath14 function defined as :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the probability of finding the datum @xmath17 given the set of parameters @xmath12 . the value of @xmath14 is usually determined over a grid that explores the region of interest in the @xmath11-dimension parameter space in order to identify the global maximum @xmath18 , subject to a normalization constraint that has no impact in our analysis . in practice",
    ", @xmath16 is the value of the model defined by the set of parameters @xmath12 for the properties of datum @xmath17 .    for the case of the mw satellites we are interested in , where the number of sdss stars in each satellite can be very low ( a few tens to a few hundreds over the studied region of @xmath19 deg@xmath20 ) ,",
    "we restrict the set of models for the member star distribution on the sky , @xmath21 , to only exponential profiles .",
    "they are specified by one parameter fewer than the more customary king profiles , are also easier to deal with analytically than the plummer models and usually yield reasonable fits",
    ". we also account for the background level of stars , @xmath22 , assumed to be constant over the studied region of the sky .",
    "we therefore consider the model family @xmath23 of stellar density in the sdss , defined by the set of parameters @xmath12 , that can be expressed as :    @xmath24    with @xmath25 the central stellar density , @xmath26 the exponential scale radius of the profile and @xmath27 the elliptical radius coordinate of datum @xmath17 , as we consider flattened models .",
    "we are now left with the task of relating these three parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath27 , @xmath26 ) to the five parameters that need to be constrained , namely : the centroid of the satellite defined by the two celestial coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 or @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the spatial offset of the centroid compared to literature values ; the position angle of the satellite from north to east @xmath32 ; its ellipticity with @xmath33 the scale - length of the system along its minor axis and @xmath34 that along its major axis . ] @xmath35 ; its size defined by the half - light radius @xmath36 .",
    "the background level @xmath22 is the sixth parameter constrained with the ml fit but its influence on @xmath37 is obvious in equation  ( [ leq ] ) .",
    "a simple integration of @xmath21 out to the half - light radius easily gives the first relation @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , star @xmath17 taken from the sample , with celestial coordinates @xmath39 , has a spatial position @xmath40 related to the centroid by and @xmath29 , as is the case in this study .",
    "large deviations from the centroid would require properly accounting for the projection of stars on the tangential plane of the sky .",
    "] :    @xmath41    while the elliptical radius is related to the spatial position by :    @xmath42    with this expression , the major axis of the system is aligned with the position angle axis .",
    "finally , @xmath25 is constrained by the number of stars in the sdss sample @xmath43 as this number must also correspond to the integration of the stellar density @xmath44 over the region ( of @xmath45 ) around the satellite , that is , with the integration performed on the circular radius @xmath46 from the centroid :    @xmath47    with @xmath48 the number of stars in the sample that belong to the satellite and @xmath44 , @xmath49 and @xmath22 expressed in units of stars / arcmin@xmath20 .",
    "given that , for reasonable values of @xmath36 , @xmath49 is negligible at @xmath50 , one can integrate the first term to @xmath51 instead . from there a change of variables from the circular radius @xmath46 to the elliptical radius @xmath52 used to express @xmath49 in equations  ( [ leq ] ) and  ( [ rieq ] ) is required to simplify the integration .",
    "its jacobian is @xmath53 , yielding :    @xmath54    from which we eventually derive :    @xmath55    by substituting @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 in equations  ( [ leq ] ) and  ( [ leq ] ) by their expressions , @xmath14 is now directly expressed as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "the set of best parameters @xmath57 is determined through an iteratively refined grid that probes the region around the global maximum of @xmath14 .",
    "the final grid has grid point sizes of @xmath58 .    finally , assuming the uncertainties on the various parameters are well behaved near the global maximum ( i.e. gaussian or close to gaussian ) , it can be shown that @xmath59 behaves as a @xmath60 distribution ( e.g.   10.3 of @xcite ) and the @xmath61 confidence intervals respectively .",
    "] of the parameters are bounded by the values that correspond to the function @xmath59 dropping by @xmath62 . in practice",
    ", this translates to relative likelihood values of , respectively , 0.61 , 0.136 and 0.011 for 1 , 2 and @xmath63 .",
    "we then proceed to apply the algorithm to consistently derive the structural parameters of the 12 milky way satellites recently discovered in the sdss [ booi , botes  ii ( booii ) , cvni , canes venatici  ii ( cvnii ) , com , her , leoiv , leot , segue  1 ( seg1 ) , ursa major  i ( umai ) , umaii and wil1 ] , the 5 candidates proposed by @xcite and objects x , y and z proposed by @xcite . to test the quality of its results",
    ", we also apply the algorithm to the well studied dra dwarf galaxy .",
    "to do so , we extract stellar objects from the sdss data release  6 @xcite in a region of radius @xmath45 around the center of the satellites .",
    "we then apply a selection box loosely constructed by eye around their cmd features ( ( sub-)giant branch , horizontal branch , main sequence turn - off and main sequence in the closest cases ) so as to exclude clear milky way foreground or background contaminants .",
    "additional magnitude cuts at @xmath64 and @xmath65 ensure that the photometry is of good quality . in the case of the very faint objects",
    "wil1 as well as the @xcite and @xcite candidates , we push these limits to @xmath66 and @xmath67 in order to increase the number of stars . for each satellite , the resulting stellar spatial distribution",
    "is then used to determine the best stellar density exponential model through the ml algorithm described above .",
    "the algorithm converges , i.e. finds a unique likelihood maximum , in all cases except for 4 of the @xcite candidates and 2 of the @xcite objects , despite the deeper magnitude limits ( see below for more details ) .",
    "the results of the fits are summarized in table  1 where the best values of the six parameters are listed ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath32 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath48 , the integrated number of stars in the galaxy down to the assumed sdss depth ) .",

    "the two - dimensional relative likelihood distributions are shown in the appendix with the contours representing drops of 50 , 90 and 99% in likelihood compared to the best model .",
    "most parameter combinations exhibit no significant covariance , except for @xmath36 , @xmath35 and @xmath22 .",
    "as expected , satellites with more stars yield better constrained models ( e.g. booi , cvni , dra ) but even sparsely populated systems show well behaved likelihood distributions .",

    "the usefulness of the ml technique is manifest as it recovers the input ellipticity in almost all cases .",
    "using smoothed maps , on the other hand , leads to systematically lower recovered ellipticities and this effect gets worse as @xmath130 increases .",
    "both methods have issues for the rounder systems whose recovered ellipticity is slightly higher than the input one ; this effect is due to the degree of freedom afforded by @xmath32 for the ( quasi-)round systems in the presence of a few outer stars .",
    "comparison of the input ellipticity of the models , @xmath130 , with the output ellipticity , @xmath133 , recovered through the intensity - weighted second moments method applied to smoothed maps ( filled circles ) and through the ml algorithm ( hollow circles ) for booi - like systems .",

    "the dashed - dotted and dashed lines show the quality of the ml fit for lower density umai- and umaii - like systems respectively .",
    "uncertainties are similar to those of the booi - like models but are not shown to avoid cluttering the figure . in both cases , the recovered ellipticity falls in the region where the algorithm follows the 1-to-1 correspondence ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively ) . ]",
    "this example shows the limitations of smoothed maps in determining the structural parameters of faint satellites .",
    "not only do they require some fine - tuning to have a set of pixel size , kernel size and background threshold that translate into a suitable map , but even with such a map , the ellipticity is measured rounder than it truly is .",
    "this effect becomes even more important as the number of stars in the system shrinks .",
    "the strongest deviations are indeed observed for systems that are less populated than booi : cvnii , her , umai or seg1 . since in most cases , this @xmath35",
    "is then used to construct the radial profile of the satellites , this can have a significant impact on the derived structure of the system .",
    "in contrast , the ml fit is directly applied to the data ( the spatial distribution of stars ) , and all the parameters are derived at the same time , leading to best values and uncertainties that include the influence of the determination of the other structural parameters .",
    "while this analysis of the behavior of the ml fit is only done in detail for booi - like systems , it should be noted that the efficiency of the algorithm actually scales with the density of stars in the satellite and not solely with their number of stars @xmath48 within the sdss . since a lower limit of the density @xmath140",
    "can be estimated by assuming a round morphology , it scales as @xmath141 .",
    "a look at table  1 shows that @xmath140 is higher than that of booi in all other cases , except for umai , umaii and object  y. therefore , apart from these three systems , the quality of the ml fit remains at least as good as shown by the hollow circles in figure  [ input_output_ell ] and only very round systems can be found to be slightly more elliptical than they really are .",
    "the cases of the less dense umai and umaii are also shown in the figure as the dashed - dotted and dashed line respectively ( the dashed line also applies to object  y as its density is similar to that of umaii ) .",
    "even though the overestimate of small ellipticities is more significant than previously , the ellipticities of these three systems are so high that they should not be hampered by the algorithm : in both cases , the recovered ellipticity falls in the region where the algorithm behaves properly and follows the 1-to-1 line .",
    "generally , the over - prediction of the ellipticity of very round systems could become a difficulty in the case of systems sparser than those considered here . but recently discovered satellites all lie at the detection limit of the sdss @xcite and most fainter ( and sparser ) candidates , such as the @xcite and @xcite ones , are not dense enough to allow the algorithm to converge .",
    "their confirmation definitely requires deeper datasets than the sdss , leading to denser samples on which to apply the ml technique .",
    "this will consequently elevate the issue of the overestimation of small ellipticities .",
    "the use of the total magnitude to quantify the amount of stars in these very sparsely populated systems is problematic .",
    "their observed luminosity can indeed vary strongly through time , depending on whether a few stars have evolved along the red giant branch or most of them remain along the main sequence or main sequence turnoff . to remove the influence of this",
    "` cmd shot - noise ' , we propose to characterize the systems by their _ number _ of member stars ( above a luminosity threshold ) , @xmath48 , instead of the _ luminosity _ of these stars , and study the impact of @xmath48 on the total magnitudes and stellar masses that are likely to be observed .    for each satellite",
    "we have stellar population models , also derived from sdss data @xcite , and the ml fit gives @xmath48 with its associated uncertainty ; so we can generate numerous cmds of each system .",
    "the luminosity of the stars in each of these cmds then yields the ` observed magnitude ' of _ this particular realization _ of the satellite .",
    "we then define the ` expected absolute magnitude ' of the system as the median of the distribution of observed magnitudes . in detail ,",
    "a high signal - to - noise cmd is created for each dwarf , containing on average 70000 stars , which includes a realistic photometric error and completeness model for sdss data @xcite .",
    "these ` master - cmds ' are populated assuming a standard salpeter or kroupa initial mass function @xcite down to the hydrogen burning limit ( 0.08 @xmath142 ) and a binary fraction of 0.5 .",
    "since all the satellites considered here are dominated by old populations , the stellar ages are spread between 10 and 13 gyr in all cases and the metallicities are chosen to correspond to the best - fit values from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* given in their table  5 ) , where available .",
    "as these metallicities are only a means to parametrize and reproduce the sdss cmds , we abstain from using spectroscopic metallicities . despite being more accurate ,",
    "these could be systematically offset from the isochrones and lead to artificial cmds that are different from the observed ones . in the case of booii , draco and sdssj1058",
    "+ 2843 , whose stellar population models were not derived by @xcite , we assume the same old populations and metallicities of @xmath143 @xcite , @xmath144 @xcite and @xmath145 @xcite respectively . in order to track not only the luminosities of the satellites , but also their stellar masses , the mass of each star in the ` master - cmds ' is stored , together with its magnitude and color .",
    "one thousand realizations of each satellite are generated randomly by selecting @xmath48 stars ( with its associated uncertainty listed in table  1 ) from the ` master - cmd ' to fall within the selection box previously used to select member stars .",
    "the ` observed magnitude ' of each realization is then determined from the luminosity of all stars above a limiting magnitude of @xmath146 ( half a magnitude brighter than the approximate 100% completeness limit of the sdss ) , transformed to the @xmath147-band using color equations from @xcite . using the distance listed in table  1",
    ", the luminosity of stars below the magnitude limit is accounted for by using luminosity function ( lf ) corrections derived from the lfs of @xcite with the metallicity and age closest to each model population .    in parallel",
    ", we also determine the stellar mass of the satellites by determining the mass down to the same magnitude limit as above and then correcting for the ` unobserved ' stars present in the ` master - cmds ' , down to the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "this correction is done for both a salpeter and a kroupa imf to yield two estimates of the stellar mass listed in table  1 for each satellite ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively ) .",
    "the resulting distributions of these ` observed magnitudes ' and ` observed stellar masses ' are shown in figure  [ fig_mv ] along with their ` expected absolute magnitude ' and ` expected stellar mass ' , taken to be the median value of the distributions .",
    "the scatter produced by the ` cmd shot - noise ' is readily visible from the horizontal error bars that represent the central 68.3% of the distributions .",
    "all values and their @xmath150 are listed in table  1 . as could be expected , bright galaxies such as cvni and dra have an extremely small scatter , as their @xmath48 is very well determined by the ml fit .",
    "@xmath48 is also large enough that there is a good sampling of the cmd : whatever the random realization , the resulting cmd is very similar . on the other hand , as the satellites become fainter and fainter , their cmds are only sparsely sampled for each realization and the resulting magnitude is strongly influenced by the presence of only a few very bright stars .",
    "the stellar masses are much less affected by these cmd sampling problems ; indeed the evolution of an individual star does not change its mass as strongly as its luminosity .        for a proper comparison of our absolute magnitudes with the literature ,",
    "we need to include the uncertainties that come from our assumptions on the age and metallicity of the dwarf and thence on the lf correction .",
    "this correction is , however , almost insensitive to @xmath151dex changes in the metallicity ( less than 1% change ) while a shift of @xmath152 yields small changes of only @xmath153 in all cases .",
    "this translates into uncertainties of less than @xmath154mag .",
    "another source of uncertainty can come from the assumption that the satellites are well represented by a single population model .",
    "in fact we know in the case of cvni that this is not the case as @xmath155 of the stars are found to be young @xcite .",
    "however , such a low proportion of young stars only minutely affects the luminosity correction ( by less than 1% ) and does not impact our results .",
    "this is not the case anymore for systems with a significantly extended star formation history and we therefore refrain from determining a magnitude for leot .    finally , we also account for the uncertainty coming from the distance measurements , @xmath156 ( usually of the order of 10% in distance or 0.3mag ; see table  1 ) .",
    "the final uncertainties given in table  1 correspond to the quadratic sum of all three uncertainties : @xmath157 .",
    "comparison of these with values of @xmath158 readily shows that the ` cmd shot - noise ' is the main driver of uncertainties on the ` expected absolute magnitude ' of such faint systems .    in the end , almost all of our luminosity measurements are less than @xmath76 from literature values but with slightly smaller error bars .",
    "the draco value is in excellent agreement with that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath159 ) .",
    "we confirm the extremely low luminosity of booii , umaii , wil1 and seg1 , although for this latter case , we find it is even fainter than previously measured ( @xmath160 vs. @xmath161 ) . at the other end of the spectrum , we find that cvni is somewhat brighter than previously inferred , which makes it almost as bright as draco : this galaxy should probably not be seen as a peculiar faint system but mainly owes its late discovery to its large distance .",
    "our value for umai is significantly smaller than that of the discovery paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath162 ) but , as for its half - light radius , it confirms the new measurement by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath163 ) .",
    "this value also solves the issue of booi containing more stars than umai while being an apparently fainter system @xcite : booi _ is _ brighter than umai and _ should _ contain more stars .    from the luminosity and structural parameters of the systems , we also estimate their central surface brightness @xmath164 , listed in table  1 . as the central surface brightness ( expressed in units of @xmath165/arcsec@xmath20 )",
    "is proportional to @xmath166 [ see equation ( 6 ) ] , our newly derived parameters sometimes have a strong impact on the derived @xmath164 that can be significantly different from previous estimates . when our morphological model is similar to previous models , we nevertheless reach very similar values ( e.g. dra with @xmath167mag / arcsec@xmath20 vs. @xmath168mag / arcsec@xmath20 in @xcite or booi with @xmath169mag / arcsec@xmath20 vs. @xmath170mag / arcsec@xmath20 in @xcite ) .",
    "we find that there is no system fainter than @xmath171mag / arcsec@xmath20 , a threshold that is brighter than previously claimed but in very good agreement with the detection limit of the @xcite automatic search .",
    "apart from the scatter due to the uncertainty in @xmath48 , the largest contribution to the uncertainty of any stellar mass determination comes from the assumed imf .",
    "the strength of this effect is readily visible by comparing the two stellar mass estimates listed in table  1 for the salpeter and kroupa imfs .",
    "it should be noted that even in the case of very faint satellites , the changes in the luminosities of the systems have only a small impact on the determinations of their total ( dark and luminous ) mass @xcite as these are very model - dependent and strongly dominated by other uncertainties .",
    "the best - fit model of a satellite can also be used to test whether the data imply deviations from this best ( smooth and symmetrical ) model . one of the striking features of most of the recently discovered systems is their apparent clumpiness , even when the stellar distribution is smoothed .",
    "it has been suggested on numerous occasions that their distorted isophotes could be the sign of tidal distortion or intrinsic clumpiness @xcite .",
    "however , the ( very ) low number of detected stars may leave the same impression , even if the parent distribution were smooth and symmetric .",
    "a good visual example of such a ` low number statistic ' behavior is given in figure  [ fig_maps ] , where the smoothed map of booi ( left ) is compared to similar maps built from _",
    "purely spheroidal _ models with the structural parameters obtained from the ml algorithm @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( the background contamination is accounted for in the same way as in the models presented in   2 ) .",
    "it is readily apparent that , even with the smoothing that tends to drown small clumps , the realizations of purely spheroidal models appear just as distorted as the observed data .",
    "taken at face value , most of them would in fact be suspected to contain ` tidal features ' .",
    "@xcite reach similar conclusions in their analysis of booii .    to better estimate the ( non-)significance of the apparent distortions , we determine , for all satellites , the fractional r.m.s . deviation @xmath175 of the data compared to the best model , accounting for the expected contribution of poisson counting uncertainties .",
    "this is similar to the method that @xcite applied to measure the clumpiness of the milky way halo .",
    "although the reader is referred to this paper for a detailed description , the gist of the method is to compare the actual deviations between the data and the model with the expected deviations from poisson statistics . for a binned ( but not smoothed ) map of the considered system with @xmath176 pixels of interest",
    "we therefore compute :    @xmath177    where @xmath178 is the number counts in the data for pixel @xmath17 , @xmath179 the expected number of stars in this pixel from the best model determined in table  1 and @xmath180 that of a poisson realization of this best model . to avoid being sensitive to clumpiness in the background , induced e.g. by the clustering of misidentified background galaxies , we only consider the @xmath176 pixels for which @xmath179 is at least twice the number of stars expected from the background alone .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , who have a large number of pixels , the value of @xmath176 remains very low in the case of the maps of milky way satellites . to still get a good handle on the influence of poisson noise , we rely on a monte - carlo analysis and",
    "generate numerous poisson realizations of the models to study the _ distribution _ of @xmath181 values for each system .",
    "moreover , since these values can become negative in the case of an absence of distortion , we refrain from determining @xmath175 right away . in this case",
    ", @xmath182 means that the scatter in the sdss data is actually smaller than the typical scatter expected from shot - noise for the best model .         as noted by @xcite ,",
    "this method is insensitive to the chosen pixel scale but will only be able to measure the influence of deviations from the best model that have a size at least bigger than the chosen pixel size .",
    "we therefore assume 4 different grids with pixel scales of @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath135 for which we determine the distribution of @xmath181 values ) and populated objects in our sample . ] .",
    "the derived distributions are shown in figure  [ rms_fig ] for three examples : booi where the pixels correspond to physical sizes of 10 , 19 , 38 and @xmath186 , cvni ( respectively 32 , 63 , 127 and @xmath187 ) and umaii ( respectively 4 , 9 , 17 and @xmath188 ) .",
    "the influence of the pixel grid is readily visible : the distributions derived from the small pixel grids have much more scatter , while larger pixel grids lead to almost no scatter and are closer to zero . in that case , there are not enough pixels for such sparse systems ( and these examples are among the most populated of the new mw satellites ) .    in most cases the distributions are similar to the ones of booi shown on the left panel and imply the absence of any significant deviation from a scatter in the stellar distribution that is only produced by shot - noise .",
    "however , cvni and umaii are the two cases where poisson scatter alone may not account for the measured scatter in the distributions .",
    "the distribution from the @xmath189 grid of cvni yields @xmath190 , a mild @xmath76 detection that might be induced by deviations from the best ml model in the data .",
    "there is a slightly more significant deviation in umaii with the @xmath191 and @xmath192 grids yielding respectively @xmath193 and @xmath194 , or a contribution of intrinsic clumpiness to the scatter of @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( the results of the @xmath185 grid , @xmath197 , although consistent with no distortion , have large enough uncertainties that they are also consistent with a signal of the order of that found for the @xmath184 and @xmath135 grids ) .",
    "it is reassuring that the two dwarfs that show the highest evidence of clumpiness with this method are the two cases where distortions or substructure have been argued on other grounds .",
    "indeed , a clump of young stars was uncovered in deep lbt observations of cvni @xcite and , with a size of @xmath198 , it should only be picked up by the grid with the smallest pixel size .",
    "in addition , umaii , the other galaxy that appears to contain a deviation from its best model is the likely progenitor of the orphan stream and is therefore expected to be suffering from tidal disruption ( @xcite although see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "these two cases are only @xmath199 deviations from null - detections and , given the 60 distributions generated for the 15 studied satellites , it can not be ruled out that they are in fact chance detections that have nothing to do with real distortions in the morphology of the dwarfs .",
    "although tentative , the detections in cvni and umaii therefore need to be confirmed from deeper , more populated datasets . in all the other satellites ,",
    "the scatter in the stellar density can be entirely accounted for by shot - noise in the sdss data .",
    "either these systems intrinsically contain no distortion or the sdss is too shallow to allow detection of any such clumpiness .",
    "we have re - derived the structural parameters and magnitudes for all the newly discovered milky way satellites ( table  1 ) . not only are these determined in a homogeneous manner for all objects , but the ml algorithm produces robust results , even for extremely faint systems that only contain a few tens of stars in the sdss . as mentioned above , our results are overall in good agreement with previous measurements although there are some systematic differences , such as a higher ellipticity found with the ml technique compared to that measured from smoothed maps .",
    "those cases are easily understood since sparsely populated smoothed maps tend to be dominated by the ( round ) smoothing kernel .",
    "the complete dataset can be summarized on the @xmath36 vs. @xmath200 plane where dwarf galaxies and globular clusters were well separated prior to recent discoveries .",
    "figure  [ mv_rhb ] shows the milky way satellite system with globular clusters taken from the list of @xcite ( with the addition of the two extremely dim clusters found by @xcite ) represented as big dots , previously known dwarf spheroidal galaxies as filled squares ( the values are taken from @xcite ) and recently discovered sdss satellites as circled squares .",
    "all the new satellites are smoothly distributed from the region inhabited by the brighter dwarf galaxies , down to extremely small and faint systems . as previously noted by @xcite and @xcite , the clear size difference that existed before between globular clusters , with sizes smaller than @xmath201 and",
    "dwarf galaxies @xmath202 becomes blurred at low luminosities .",
    "many sdss satellites are in fact smaller that @xmath203 ( booii , cvnii , com , sdssj1058 + 2843 , seg1 and wil1 ) .",
    "therefore , it might appear more difficult to assign these systems to one population or the other . however ,",
    "spectroscopic surveys conducted so far @xcite show that they are dark matter dominated ( except maybe for sdssj1058 + 2843 and seg1 for which no spectroscopic data have yet been published ) .",
    "another obvious feature of figure  [ mv_rhb ] is the higher ellipticity of dwarf galaxies compared to globular clusters .",
    "unfortunately , most faint gcs ( @xmath204 ) have no ellipticity measurement in the @xcite list .",
    "they also either lie away from the region covered by the sdss or have incomplete photometry due to crowding at their center . as a result",
    ", we can not determine their structural parameters using the ml algorithm .",
    "still , in cases where crowding leads to incomplete data in the sdss catalog , the clusters do appear visually round in their outskirts .",
    "pal  5 ( @xmath205 ) is one of the few gcs to which we can apply the ml algorithm .",
    "this object is of particular interest as it is known to be tidally disrupting in the gravity field of the milky way and shows beautiful stellar tidal tails @xcite . even in such an extreme case when one could expect the measured ellipticity to be inflated by the tails , applying the ml algorithm yields @xmath206 and the cluster remains very round .",
    "moreover the 5 faint gcs in the list that have an ellipticity measurement all have @xmath207 so there does appear to be a significant difference between the flattening of genuine gcs and that of newly discovered mw satellites .",
    "evolution of the ellipticity of mw satellites as a function of their absolute magnitude ( left panel ) .",
    "globular clusters are this time shown as small hollow circles to avoid cluttering the plot , while the symbols for dwarf galaxies are the same as in figure  [ mv_rhb ] .",
    "error bars correspond to the uncertainties listed in table  1 or in @xcite for the brighter galaxies . dividing the complete sample at @xmath208 ( dotted line )",
    "leads to the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the faint subsample , represented by a full line in the right panel , that extends to higher @xmath35 values than that of bright galaxies ( dashed line ) .",
    "the mean of the pdf of faint ( bright ) systems is represented by the thick ( thin ) arrow . ]",
    "the left panel of figure  [ ell_fig ] shows the distribution of mw satellites in the @xmath209 plane .",
    "as was already reported by @xcite using the previous , rounder ellipticity estimates , gcs and dwarf galaxies populate different regions of the plot ( a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test actually yields a probability of 0% that both datasets follow the same ellipticity probability distribution ) .",
    "such a drastic difference is probably related to the formation mechanism of the objects in the two samples and/or to the presence of a dark matter halo around dwarf galaxies whereas gcs are not believed to contain any dark matter . as for the dwarf galaxies , they appear to become more flattened as they become fainter .",
    "when dividing the total sample of dwarf galaxies at a @xmath208 threshold , more than a third of the faint systems ( 4 out of 11 ) have ellipticities that are higher than 0.5 . on the other hand , this is the case for only a single bright satellite ( umi ; or 2 if one accounts for sgr ) .",
    "furthermore , three of these highly flattened faint systems ( her , umai , umaii ) are reasonably well populated systems in the sdss ( @xmath210 , 70 and 296 stars respectively ) and with only small uncertainties on @xmath35 .",
    "to quantify this difference in the ellipticity , the right panel of figure  [ ell_fig ] presents the probability distribution functions of the faint ( full line ) and bright subsamples ( dashed line ) .",
    "the arrows correspond to the mean of the two distributions , that are significantly different ( a @xmath1 difference ) : @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively ( the uncertainties are determined from a monte - carlo resampling of the subsamples , redrawing the individual @xmath35 values following the uncertainties of table  1 ) .",
    "a ks test also yields a very low probability ( 0.4% ) that the two subsamples are derived from the same underlying distribution .",
    "the scatter of the pdfs is , however , hard to constrain as it results from two effects : from the larger uncertainties of faint systems , especially the rounder ones ( @xmath213 ) , but also from the presence of objects whose uncertainties span a large range in ellipticities .",
    "in contrast , the majority of bright satellites are clustered in the range @xmath214 ( car , dra , for , scu , sex , leot ) .",
    "several possible explanations for these flat dwarf galaxies have already been laid out in @xcite for the case of her , but are worth recalling and developing in a broader perspective here .",
    "current spectroscopic surveys , albeit usually targeting only a few tens of stars in each satellite , show no obvious sign of rotation .",
    "even if the systems were rotationally supported , they would be approximately oblate .",
    "as we can assume we are seeing them at random viewing angles , their intrinsic flattening would be much more than @xmath2 .",
    "in that case , they would have implausibly flat shapes and implausibly low intrinsic velocity dispersions , given their already low measured velocity dispersions in the range @xmath215 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that dissipative gas infall during galaxy formation can induce changes in the shape of dark matter ( dm ) halos and make them rounder than in the absence of any baryons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lower baryon / star content of the recently discovered mw satellites @xcite would permit the dark matter halo to remain triaxial , often nearly prolate , for these systems .",
    "assuming stars trace the dm potential , they would then appear more elongated in the faintest systems .",
    "@xcite have studied the shape of the dm subhalos in the via lactea simulation of a milky way size @xmath216cdm halo .",
    "they follow subhalos down to a mass of @xmath217 , not much higher than those of the faint mw dwarf galaxies studied here , and find them to have a more elliptical shape in their central regions .",
    "this could provide an alternate explanation for the shape of the faintest satellites , which are also the smallest ( because the larger ones can not be found in the sdss ; @xcite ) : stars probe a smaller region of the subhalo , and therefore trace out a less spherical potential .",
    "this latter argument can not , however , explain the shape of the three satellites with the highest @xmath35 ( her , umai and umaii ) as all three are large satellites with @xmath218 .",
    "the main issue with this scenario is the assumption of stars distributing themselves in the dm subhalo so as to follow the shape of underlying mass potential for which no cogent mechanism exists .",
    "the best example of tidally induced elongation in the local group is given by the sagittarius dwarf that is clearly being disrupted by the milky way as it leaves behind stellar streams wrapped around the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this results in an ellipticity of @xmath219 for the ( already disrupting ) main body of the dwarf @xcite , close to the values that we have measured for her , umaii and , to a lesser extent umai .",
    "the absence of any direct evidence of stellar streams originating from the faint dwarf galaxies could easily be explained by their faintness that implies that , if they exist , such features should be very sparsely populated .",
    "umaii has also been proposed to be the progenitor of the orphan stream , which would lend support to this tidal distortion scenario , at least for this satellite .    as explained in @xcite , tidal distortion",
    "requires the satellite to pass close enough to the mw to be stripped .",
    "simple arguments can be used to estimate the required pericenter of the galaxy s orbit as @xmath220 with @xmath221 its size scale , @xmath222 its velocity dispersion and @xmath223 that of the milky way . for her ,",
    "umai and umaii , the inferred pericenter is of the order of @xmath224 which makes for very eccentric orbits in the case of umai ( @xmath225 ) and her ( @xmath226 ) , with an eccentricity of @xmath227 for both .",
    "in addition , this latter object is certainly not at apogalacticon since it shows a large receding motion from the mw ( @xmath228 , corrected for the solar motion ) .",
    "very eccentric orbits are not unheard of in dark matter simulations of galactic groups .",
    "for example , @xcite show that their surviving satellites at @xmath229 have a mean orbital eccentricity of @xmath230 , with a standard deviation of 0.19 .",
    "@xcite also finds that half of infalling dark - matter substructures are on near parabolic orbits ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite identified in their simulations of @xmath232 galaxies that about a third of their satellite dark subhalos have ` unorthodox ' ( including high eccentricity ) orbits from three body interactions in the galactic halo . in this scenario ,",
    "the satellites most severely stripped by tides would be both the least luminous and the most elongated .",
    "however , @xcite have recently argued that the observed size and central radial velocity dispersions of the new sdss satellites are generally not low enough to be disrupted versions of the fornax , draco or sagittarius dwarfs .",
    "so this explanatory scenario also appears problematic .",
    "overall , none of these three scenarios is entirely satisfactory but we believe that the latest , elongation induced by tidal interaction with the milky way , may be the least problematic .",
    "indeed , there _ is _ a known stellar stream that could be produced by the disruption of umaii , the orphan stream , and a few mw satellites with very eccentric orbits is far from impossible .",
    "moreover , the importance of the @xcite caveat depends , for each satellite , on the amount of stellar loss , which is all but constrained .",
    "the new satellites could therefore correspond to a murky sample of galaxies at different stages of their disruption , strongly hampering any analysis of the population as a whole .",
    "we have presented a rigorous and homogeneous ( re-)analysis of the structure of the stellar bodies of the recently discovered milky way satellites .",
    "the application of a maximum likelihood algorithm to sdss data yields robust estimates of the centroid , position angle , ellipticity , exponential half - light radius and number of member stars ( within the sdss ) for the 15 faintest candidate dwarf galaxies around the galaxy . with the assumption of stellar population models , derived through the analysis of the same dataset",
    ", we have also studied the impact of ` cmd shot - noise ' on the observed luminosities and stellar masses of these satellites .",
    "the magnitude of the faintest systems can be hampered by a large scatter ( of up to @xmath233mag ) that is due solely to the individual evolution of their very few stars .",
    "stellar mass estimates suffer less from this sparseness but , obviously , depend strongly on the assumed imf . finally , we have shown that except for tentative evidence of deviations from the best model in the cvni and umaii dwarf galaxies , the apparently distorted morphology of the satellites in the sdss can be entirely accounted for by shot - noise .",
    "this does not mean that some distortion is not present , but only that deeper datasets are required : one should not rely on a visual inspection of stellar density maps as the structure in these is strongly driven by the low number of stars that are observed in each satellite .    in our discussion , we focussed on the remarkable result that the faintest satellites are , on average , highly flattened .",
    "we put forth three lines of explanations , but none of these three scenarios is entirely satisfactory .",
    "however , we believe that tidally induced elongation may be the least problematic and is certainly the easiest to ( dis)prove from observed distortions or tidal streams from the stellar maps of these dwarf galaxies .",
    "this however requires deeper follow - up data than the sdss since our search of such distortions yields mainly null - detections when accounting for poisson noise .",
    "alternatively , a final answer will strongly benefit from deeper systematic surveys such as the panstarrs @xmath234 survey @xcite that should significantly expand the sdss harvest of faint satellites of the local group .",

    "<S> we derive the structural parameters of the recently discovered very low luminosity milky way satellites through a maximum likelihood algorithm applied to sdss data . for each satellite , </S>",
    "<S> even when only a few tens of stars are available down to the sdss flux limit , the algorithm yields robust estimates and errors for the centroid , position angle , ellipticity , exponential half - light radius and number of member stars ( within the sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> this latter parameter is then used in conjunction with stellar population models of the satellites to derive their absolute magnitudes and stellar masses , accounting for ` color - magnitude diagram shot - noise ' . </S>",
    "<S> most parameters are in good agreement with previous determinations but we now properly account for parameter covariances . however , we find that faint satellites are somewhat more elliptical than initially found and ascribe that to the previous use of smoothed maps which can be dominated by the smoothing ( round ) kernel . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the faintest half of the milky way dwarf galaxies ( @xmath0 ) is significantly ( @xmath1 ) flatter ( @xmath2 ) than its brightest half ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) . from our best models </S>",
    "<S> , we also investigate whether the seemingly distorted shape of the satellites , often taken to be a sign of tidal distortion , can be quantified . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , except for tentative evidence of distortion in canes venatici  i and ursa major  ii , these can be completely accounted for by poisson scatter in the sparsely sampled systems . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three scenarios that could explain the rather elongated shape of faint satellites : rotation supported systems , stars following the shape of more triaxial dark matter subhalos , or elongation due to tidal interaction with the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> although none of these is entirely satisfactory , the last one appears the least problematic , but obviously warrants much deeper observations to track evidence of such tidal interaction . </S>"
