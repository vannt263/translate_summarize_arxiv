    "the @xmath0 meson , one of the pseudoscalar mesons , is known to have a peculiarly large mass ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is attributed to the @xmath3 anomaly in quantum chromodynamics , together with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry  @xcite . at finite density , in which chiral symmetry will be partially restored ,",
    "the mass is expected to be decreased .",
    "it means that an @xmath0 meson in a nucleus feels an attractive interaction with the nucleus , and that they may form a bound state ( @xmath0-mesic nucleus ) , if the mass reduction is large enough .",
    "for example , calculations based on the nambu  jona - lasinio model result in a very large mass reduction of @xmath4 at the normal nuclear density  @xcite , while a recent calculation using the linear sigma model shows @xmath5 mass reduction  @xcite .",
    "the qmc ( quark - meson coupling ) model predicts @xmath6 reduction for the case of an @xmath7-@xmath0 mixing angle of @xmath8  @xcite .    as for the decay width of an @xmath0-mesic nucleus",
    ", the chiral unitary model including a lagrangian term which couples the singlet meson to the baryons indicates that the real part of the optical potential is in general deeper than the imaginary part  @xcite .",
    "this relationship is one of the important requirements for an @xmath0-mesic nucleus to be observed experimentally .",
    "recently , the cbelsa / taps experiment determined the real part  @xcite and the imaginary part  @xcite through detailed studies of the @xmath0 photoproduction off nuclei .",
    "first , the transparency ratios for different nuclear targets and incident energies were compared with theoretical calculations , and the absorption width for an @xmath0 meson with an average momentum of @xmath9 was obtained to be @xmath10 at the normal nuclear density  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the excitation function for @xmath0 photoproduction off carbon and the momentum distribution of @xmath0 meson are sensitive to the @xmath0-nucleus potential depth .",
    "the potential depth was derived as @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the combination of the two results indicates the possible existence of @xmath0-mesic nuclei with a rather narrow width .",
    "related to the study of @xmath0-nucleus interaction , the @xmath0-nucleon scattering length can be determined by the measurement of the @xmath12 reaction  @xcite . the result is comparable to the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential parameters obtained by cbelsa / taps , if there is no density and energy dependence of the @xmath0-nucleon interaction .",
    "another method to extract information on the @xmath0-nucleus interaction is the investigation of @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "we have proposed a missing - mass spectroscopy experiment of @xmath0-mesic nuclei by use of the @xmath1 reaction  @xcite .",
    "the first experiment was carried out at gsi in august 2014 , and an upgraded experiment at fair is also planned .",
    "@xmath0-mesic nuclei can be produced by impinging a proton beam onto a carbon target .",
    "the beam energy is chosen to be @xmath13 , slightly above the @xmath0 production threshold for a free nucleon .",
    "the ejectile deuterons will be momentum - analyzed by the fragment separator ( frs ) used as a high - resolution spectrometer .",
    "a simulated spectrum corresponding to 4.5 days of data acquisition is shown in fig .",
    "[ missingmass ] . here , a theoretical calculation for this reaction  @xcite is used as the input of the signal , i.e.  processes associated with @xmath0 meson production , while an overwhelming background of multi - pion production processes on a nucleon in the carbon nucleus ( mainly @xmath14 , @xmath15 , or 4@xmath16 ) was evaluated from past measurements of proton - nucleon cross sections .",
    "the sensitivity of observing peak structures is highly dependent on the parameters of the optical potential ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we find the signal - to - noise ratio to be of the order of 1/100 at most .",
    "however , the poor signal - to - noise ratio in the inclusive measurement may be compensated by a high - statistics measurement for several days .",
    "we carried out the first experiment ( gsi s-437 ) in august 2014 .",
    "figure  [ frs_setup ] shows the experimental setup at frs .",
    "the momentum of ejectile deuterons can be derived by measuring their tracks by two sets of multi - wire drift chambers ( mwdc s ) installed near a dispersive focal plane at s4 .",
    "the overall resolution had been evaluated to be approximately @xmath18 in @xmath19 , which is sufficiently smaller than the expected width of @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "the actual resolution will be evaluated by using the calibration measurement of the elastic scattering @xmath20 reaction .",
    "the excitation energies between @xmath21 and @xmath22 relative to the @xmath0 emission threshold were investigated by scaling the magnetic field of frs .",
    "particle identification of the ejectiles is essential , since inelastic scattering @xmath23 reactions will cause a number of protons whose momenta are close to those of deuterons of interest . for this purpose ,",
    "plastic scintillators ( sc2h , sc2v , sc41 , sc42 ) were installed both in the s2 and s4 areas .",
    "in addition to the time - of - flight ( tof ) measurement , erenkov detectors with high refractive - index ( @xmath24 ) silica aerogel radiators , which were developed at chiba university  @xcite , ( hirac and mini - hirac ) and a total - reflection erenkov detector with an acrylite radiator ( torch ) were installed for additional information on particle identification .",
    "figure  [ tof2h41 ] is the tof distribution between s2 and s4 with an unbiased trigger .",
    "the larger peak corresponds to protons , which are faster than deuterons , and the smaller peak comes from deuterons .",
    "the tof difference of the two particles is about @xmath25 , which is consistent with that calculated from the flight distance and each velocity .",
    "the deuteron - to - proton ratio is found to be approximately 1/200 .",
    "after this measurement , we could prepare a `` tof trigger '' to select deuterons by a tight coincidence of signals from scintillators at s2 and s4 .",
    "we realized much better deuteron - to - proton ratio , approximately unity , without using the signals from the erenkov detectors , while they can be used for improving off - line analyses .    at present , we have been working on off - line analyses for particle identification .",
    "the flat component beneath the deuteron peak in fig .",
    "[ tof2h41 ] is due to sequential protons with a short ( @xmath26 ) time interval .",
    "the waveforms of the scintillator signals will serve to distinguish one - pulse events from two - pulse events .",
    "in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio in the missing - mass spectrum , we plan to measure protons from the decay of @xmath0-mesic nuclei in addition to ejectile deuterons .",
    "one of the major decay modes is a two - nucleon absorption process ( @xmath27 )  @xcite , which will emit a proton with a kinetic energy around @xmath28 .",
    "an intra - nuclear cascade simulation with a microscopic transport model jam  @xcite is on - going , not only for the signal but also the background multi - pion production processes , in which pions may result in the emission of secondary protons after rescattering inside the nucleus .",
    "we have performed an inclusive measurement of the @xmath1 reaction on @xmath29 at frs / gsi in august 2014 , in order to investigate @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "a wide excitation - energy range between @xmath21 and @xmath22 was investigated .",
    "the expected resolution will be @xmath30 , which is much smaller than the width of @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "the analysis is in progress .",
    "furthermore , we aim to conduct a semi - exclusive measurement at fair , in which protons from the two - nucleon absorption of an @xmath0 meson in nucleus will be detected too",
    ". the signal - to - noise ratio in the missing - mass spectrum will be improved drastically by the coincidence measurement .",
    "a detailed simulation taking into account the final - state interaction is needed for a quantitative evaluation of the sensitivity .",
    "the experiment was performed in the framework of the super - frs collaboration for fair .",
