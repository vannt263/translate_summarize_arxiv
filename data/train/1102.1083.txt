    "molecular magnets have been a subject of intense experimental and theoretical studies for almost two decades , see refs.for a review .",
    "the field belongs to mesoscopic physics as the typical length scales are between micro- and macroscopic .",
    "such an intermediate parameter regime provides unique conditions for observing quantum and classical phenomena acting together . besides , a large magnetic spin of a single molecule makes molecular magnets natural candidates for novel magnetic storage media and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "two prominent and well investigated materials in this research field are @xmath1-acetate and @xmath2 , both which demonstrate super - paramagnetic properties @xcite .",
    "they both have a large spin at the ground state ( @xmath3 ) and strong magnetic anisotropy with 10 pairs of degenerated levels corresponding to positive and negative projections @xmath4 on a chosen axis , and an additional level with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "when an external magnetic field is applied to a sample of molecular magnets along the crystal axis , then spin orientation in the direction of the field becomes preferable . at low temperature",
    "all molecules populate only one level ( e.g. @xmath6 ) and the magnetization reaches the saturation value . if the direction of the external magnetic field changes to the opposite one , then the former ground state of the molecules becomes metastable with an increased potential energy ( the zeeman energy ) .",
    "an energy barrier hinders direct transition of the molecules from the metastable state to the new ground state , which , therefore , can occur as a thermal relaxation or as avalanches .",
    "thermal relaxation goes slowly and uniformly in space for the whole sample . at temperatures of a few kelvin this process",
    "may be neglected , since its characteristic time is rather large , e.g. , about two months for @xmath1 at 2 k @xcite .",
    "however , many experimental works on molecular magnets demonstrated quite fast transition in a form of avalanche with the characteristic time about few milliseconds @xcite .",
    "recent detailed studies of the avalanche revealed that the spin reversal does not happen simultaneously within the whole sample in that case , but it occurs in a narrow zone propagating as a front at a velocity of several meters per second @xcite .",
    "the avalanche is accompanied by significant heat release similar to a deflagration wave in combustion and for this reason it was named `` magnetic deflagration '' .    in slow combustion , the deflagration front corresponds to a thin zone of chemical reactions separating the cold fuel mixture and the hot burned products @xcite .",
    "the released energy is transmitted to the cold fuel mixture due to thermal conduction ; the temperature of the fuel mixture increases , which stimulates chemical reactions .",
    "the slow combustion front propagates in gaseous mixtures with a substantially subsonic velocity within the range from several centimeters to several meters per second @xcite .",
    "analogously , in magnetic deflagration , the energy of chemical reactions is replaced by the zeeman energy of the molecular magnets in an external magnetic field .",
    "the released energy is distributed to the neighboring layers by thermal conduction , which increases the temperature of the originally cold medium and leads to much higher probability of spin transition . in recent studies , garanin and",
    "chudnovsky @xcite developed a theoretical description of a planar stationary magnetic deflagration with maximal possible release of the zeeman energy ( they called such a regime `` full burning '' ) .",
    "since then , a number of papers have been devoted to ignition techniques and speed measurements of the magnetic deflagration in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "magnetic avalanches have been also observed in other materials , like the intermetallic compound @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetic `` burning '' does not necessarily have to be complete . as we show in the present paper ,",
    "the zeeman energy release depends on the external magnetic field and on the initial concentration of active molecules .",
    "a sufficiently low energy release may lead to a new pulsating regime of magnetic deflagration .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the stability of a planar stationary front of magnetic deflagration . here",
    ", we demonstrate that stationary deflagration is unstable with respect to one - dimensional perturbations if the zeeman energy release at the front is sufficiently low in comparison with the energy barrier of the spin transition .",
    "the condition of the instability may be formulated using the zeldovich number , similar to the case of combustion of solid propellants @xcite . in the problem of magnetic deflagration ,",
    "the zeldovich number is essentially given by the ratio of the energy barrier of the molecular magnets and the temperature at the deflagration as determined by the zeeman energy release . when the zeldovich number exceeds a certain critical value , a stationary deflagration front becomes unstable and propagates in a pulsating regime .",
    "we obtain analytical estimates for the critical zeldovich number .",
    "we investigate the linear stage of the instability numerically by solving the eigenvalue problem .",
    "we study the nonlinear stage using direct numerical simulations .",
    "we also discuss the experimental parameters required for observations of the pulsating regime .",
    "we consider a system of molecular magnets placed in an external magnetic field taking @xmath1-acetate as a particular example .",
    "the simplified hamiltonian of the system has been suggested to take the form @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the spin , @xmath10 is the magnetic anisotropy constant , @xmath11 is the gyromagnetic factor , @xmath12 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath13 is the external magnetic field .     in the external magnetic field @xmath14,width=326,height=230 ]    the energy levels for a molecule magnet @xmath1 in the external field of @xmath14 are depicted in fig .",
    "1 . in fig .",
    "1 we indicate the zeeman energy @xmath15 and the energy barrier @xmath16 of the transition from the metastable state to the ground state , which plays the role of the activation energy for magnetic deflagration ( both values are presented in temperature units ) . using the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) we find how these two energies depend on the magnetic field , according to @xmath17 and @xmath18 the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is quite small as compared to the first two terms , so the activation energy decreases with increase of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the zeeman energy increases linearly with the magnetic field .",
    "if the magnetic field is high enough , the energy difference between the ground state ( @xmath19 and the metastable state @xmath20 is rather large , so that all the molecules tend to occupy the lowest energy level , i.e. @xmath21 in fig .",
    "1 . when the direction of the external magnetic field switches to the opposite one , then the ground state and the metastable state exchange places and all the molecules tend to change their spin projection to the opposite one .",
    "garanin and chudnovsky identified such a transition as `` full burning '' of molecular magnets @xcite .",
    "they also indicated that the regime of full burning is possible if the magnetic field is stronger than a certain critical value . still , the external magnetic field is a controlled parameter of the experiments , which allows the possibility of incomplete burning in magnetic deflagration .",
    "we also point out that the analytical method used to calculate the magnetic deflagration speed in [ ] is rigorous only in the limit of an activation energy large compared to the energy release , a condition which is satisfied to a much better degree in the regime of incomplete burning . in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the regime of incomplete burning in magnetic deflagration achieved for a sufficiently low external magnetic field . in that case",
    "the zeeman energy is rather low , so that we obtain the fraction of molecules on the first energy level according to @xmath22 where total number of molecules in all energy levels corresponds to unity .",
    "still , in the typical experimental conditions , population of levels above the first one is negligible . at the same time",
    ", the fraction at the first level , eq . ( [ eq4 ] ) , may be significant in a low magnetic field and can not be neglected .",
    "as we will see , the stability of magnetic deflagration is sensitive to the activation energy scaled by the energy release in the process",
    ". this ratio increases also when the active @xmath1 molecules are `` diluted '' with some neutral media as it was performed experimentally in , e.g. , [ ] .",
    "when mixed carefully with other compounds , the @xmath1 molecules retain their magnetic properties .",
    "since the heat release in magnetic deflagration happens only due to active magnet molecules , then the neutral compound reduces total energy release and the final temperature of the sample , @xmath23 , thus increasing the scaled activation energy @xmath24 . as a result ,",
    "the scaled activation energy in magnetic deflagration becomes a free parameter , which may be controlled in the experiments by the external magnetic field and by the level of dilution .",

    "a combustion counterpart of this value is related to the activation energy of chemical reaction , which is typically rather large . in the case of complete burning in magnetic deflagration of @xmath46",
    "this parameter was evaluated in [ ] as @xmath47 , which is not a large value . at the same time",

    "still , the instability is rather weak in fig .",

    "magnetic deflagration propagates due to two effects : release of the zeeman energy in a thin transition zone and transfer of the energy to the cold layers ( preheating ) due to thermal conduction . in a stationary regime of magnetic deflagration",
    ", these two processes work at the same rate and balance each other .",
    "however , at high values of the activation energy , the rate of energy release is too sensitive to temperature in the transition zone .",
    "small temperature perturbations may increase the `` burning '' rate considerably , which makes the transition zone sweep fast over the preheated matter until it comes to cold regions and stops waiting for a new portion of cold matter to be preheated .",
    "as soon as it happens , next pulsation of the front takes place .",
    "it is interesting that the three figures 6 a , b and c demonstrate three qualitatively different regimes of magnetic deflagration , though the activation energy changes only within 5% from plot ( a ) to plot ( c ) . in fig 6 d",
    "we take the activation energy @xmath158 close to the bifurcation point and see a complicated front behavior at the onset of the velocity pulsations .",
    "presumably , the complicated behavior happens because of two unstable modes with close instability growth rates at the vicinity of the bifurcation point .",
    "still , after an initial transition period , the front pulsations resemble those of fig .",
    "6 c. finally , taking the activation energy noticeably larger than the bifurcation point , @xmath159 , we observe even more pronounced nonlinear features in the front oscillations with even sharper peaks of large amplitude , shown in fig .",
    "6e . the obtained results are qualitatively similar to the pulsation instability of solid propellant combustion studied in , e.g. , [ ] .",
    "as we have shown , the scaled activation energy ( or the zeldovich number ) is the main parameter , which controls 1d stability properties of magnetic deflagration .",
    "still , the problem involves other parameters as well , namely , power exponents @xmath38 and @xmath42 in the heat capacity and thermal conduction , respectively , and the scaled initial temperature of the system @xmath160 .",
    "figure 7 shows the instability growth rate for different types of thermal conduction ( different values of the power exponent @xmath42 , @xmath161 .     versus the scaled activation energy calculated for different values of the power exponent @xmath42 .",
    "other parameters are @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "the inset presents the respective temperature profiles for @xmath164 and @xmath165.,width=326,height=249 ]    as we can see , a particular type of the thermal conduction influences the temperature profile in the stationary magnetic deflagration noticeably in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq34 ] ) , see the insert of fig .",
    "7 . at the same time",
    ", the stationary profiles of concentration and energy release remain the same for different values of the @xmath42-factor .",
    "the power exponent @xmath42 determines the total length scale of the deflagration front in the cold region .",
    "however , even considerable variations of @xmath42 modify the instability growth rate only slightly : the stability limit changes only by 5% from @xmath166 to @xmath167 ; the bifurcation point changes within 15% from @xmath168 to @xmath169 .",
    "this result demonstrates that the perturbation modes are strongly localized around the zone of energy release within the length scale about @xmath96 as we explained in sec .",
    "for this reason , considerable modifications of the temperature profile in the far zone on the length scales much larger than @xmath96 due to variations of @xmath42 produce a minor effect on the stability properties .",
    "influence of the initial temperature on the instability development is even weaker . in particular , changing the scaled initial temperature from @xmath170 to @xmath171 , we find modifications of the stability properties by about 5% .    unlike @xmath42 and @xmath172 , the system dimension @xmath38 ( and the power exponent in phonon heat capacity ) influences the critical values of the scaled activation energy @xmath173 considerably since it is involved in the zeldovich number according to eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) . at the same time , the critical zeldovich number changes slightly for different values of @xmath38 .",
    "for example , we obtain the scaled activation number @xmath174 and the critical zeldovich number @xmath175 for @xmath176 , which may be compared to @xmath177 and @xmath178 found for @xmath179 .",
    "besides , one may also expect different types of heat capacity apart from the phonon type , which may modify the power law eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) and the respective deflagration stability properties @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have obtained 1d instability of magnetic deflagration in a medium of molecular magnets .",
    "the main parameter of the problem is the zeldovich number , which represents the activation energy of the system ( in temperature units ) scaled by the temperature at the deflagration front with a numerical factor depending on the type of heat capacity .",
    "we have demonstrated that the deflagration front becomes unstable when the zeldovich number exceeds a certain critical value @xmath180 .",
    "we have obtained the analytical scaling for the instability parameters at the linear stage within the model of an infinitely thin zone of zeeman energy release .",
    "we have also solved the eigenvalue stability problem numerically taking into account the internal structure of the deflagration front .",
    "the numerical solution determines the experimental parameters necessary to observe the instability . besides",
    ", we have performed direct numerical simulations , which demonstrated that the instability leads to a pulsating regime of magnetic deflagration at the nonlinear stage ."
