    "then , how such an exotic topology affects the electronic states in nanographene ?",
    "this is the question that we study here .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the mbius strip has both the sp domain wall ( sp - dw ) state@xcite and the helical state due to @xmath0 .",
    "we also show that @xmath1 stabilizes the novel domain wall state connecting the opposite charge orders of the cp state ( cp - dw ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the geometry of a zigzag ribbon with an inversion symmetry to make a mbius strip or a ring . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the width and length of the ribbon .",
    "we consider the case both @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be even .",
    "note that the twofold coordinated sites locate only at the zigzag edges , pr and qs , where the edge states are mainly localized . since the zigzag ribbon is bipartite , a and b sites are assigned by black and white circles , respectively .",

    "note that both the p and s sites belong to a sublattice while both the q and r sites belong to b sublattice . since the mbius boundary condition forces to connect the same sublattice , the mbius strip is not bipartite , while the periodic boundary condition keeps the system bipartite .",
    "we treat a half - filled @xmath8 electron system on the zigzag ribbon with the extended hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 denotes a pair of neighboring carbon sites and @xmath15 is the transfer integral between them .",

    "the mbius boundary condition forces to connect the opposite ferrimagnetic orders along the zigzag edge and causes the magnetic frustration .",
    "it allows the sp - dw state with the opposite ferrimagnetic orders connected by the interface where the magnitudes of spins are suppressed to reduce the frustration@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the helical state keeps the magnitudes of spins along the zigzag edge with the ferrimagnetic feature in a unit cell . in this state ,",
    "the directions of spins at twofold sites rotate uniformly along the zigzag edge to circumvent the magnetic frustration due to the mbius boundary condition .",
    "the spin rotates by @xmath31 in the @xmath32 plane during the travel along the zigzag edge to return to the starting point , showing the helical ferrimagnetic order .",
    "therefore , the sp - dw and helical states satisfy the constraint of the mbius boundary condition connecting the opposite zigzag edges of the ribbon , i.e. , the opposite ferrimagnetic domains in the sp state .",

    "figure 3 shows the @xmath0 dependences of the molecular orbital ( mo ) energies around the fermi level in the sp , sp - dw and helical states for the system with @xmath42 sites . in the sp state ,",
    "@xmath0 opens the energy gap between the degenerate edge states at the fermi energy , while in the sp - dw state the frontier orbitals remain inside the gap @xcite similar to the soliton state in polyacetylene @xcite . on the other hand , in the helical state",
    "the frontier orbitals behave more similarly to that in the sp state than in the sp - dw state .",
    "this is because the variation of the spin direction in the helical state is extended over the system . in the shorter ribbon with @xmath43",
    "the difference between their behaviors in the sp - dw and helical states is not so appreciable because a half pitch @xmath5 in the helical state is closer to the size of the interface in the sp - dw state .    for @xmath44 ,",
    "the helical state is lower in energy than the sp - dw state , as shown in fig .",
    "this is consistent with the mo s behavior shown in fig .",
    "3 : the wider gap and the enhanced decrease in the occupied mo energies in the helical states than in the sp - dw states . figure 4 ( b ) shows that the energy difference per unit cell is smaller in the shorter ribbon , as @xmath5 approaches the size of the interface in the sp - dw state .",
    "we recently reported that @xmath1 stabilizes the novel cp state with a finite electric dipole moment under periodic boundary condition@xcite .",
    "figure 5 ( a ) shows the charge density distribution of this state for @xmath45 and @xmath46 the positive and negative charges are localized along the lower and upper zigzag edges , respectively , due to @xmath1 and they form a finite electric dipole moment pointing from the upper edge to the lower edge .",
    "net charge along each zigzag edge arises from much larger charge density at twofold sites than at threefold sites due to the edge states .",
    "the magnitude of the electric dipole moment per unit cell is 6.2 debye in the parameters .",

    "it connects the opposite charge orders of the cp state .",
    "the mbius boundary condition allows only the cp - dw state in this case since charge is a scalar , while it allows the sp - dw and helical states in the spin ordered case since spin is a vector .",
    "the phase diagram for their competition in the @xmath0-@xmath1 space will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in summary , we demonstrated that a mbius strip of nanographene with a zigzag edge has the spin - polarized domain wall state and the helical ferrimagnetic state caused by the on - site coulomb repulsion within the extended - hubbard model under the mean field approximation and the former is lower in energy than the latter .",
