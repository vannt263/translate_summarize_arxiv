    "one of the longstanding and intriguing problems of hadron physics is the identification of the states that can be assigned as the first radial excitations of the nucleon and @xmath7 .",

    "comparison of the @xmath11n(1440)@xmath8 transition amplitudes extracted from these data @xcite with the predictions of the lf relativistic quark models ( lf rqm ) @xcite provided strong evidence for the n(1440)@xmath8 as a member of the multiplet @xmath12_r$ ] , with additional non-3-quark contributions needed to describe the low @xmath13 behavior of the amplitudes .",

    "comparison of the results obtained in the quark model with the amplitudes that are expected to be extracted from experimental data will provide important test for the commonly expected asignment of the @xmath6 as the first radial excitation of the @xmath7 .",
    "very recently , the clas data on the differential cross sections of exclusive process @xmath14 were reported in the range of @xmath15gev@xmath4 , and the invariant mass range of the @xmath16 final state @xmath17  gev @xcite .",
    "these data combined with the earlier clas data @xcite on the cross sections and longitudinally polarized beam asymmetries for this reaction in the lower mass range @xmath18gev and at close values of @xmath13 allowed the extraction of the electroexcitation amplitudes of the resonances @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 in the third resonance region .",
    "the isotopic pairs of the resonances from this region : @xmath6 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 , could not be separated from each other using data from a single isospin channel .",
    "currently new data are in preparation by the clas collaboration for the @xmath27 process in the same kinematics region as the data in the @xmath28 channel @xcite , as well as at lower @xmath13 .",
