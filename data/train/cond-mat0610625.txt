    "many physical , sociological and biological systems are represented by complex networks  @xcite .",
    "one of the important problems in complex networks is the fragmentation of networks  @xcite . in this problem one studies the statistical properties of the fragmented networks after removing nodes ( or links ) from the original fully connected network using a certain strategy .",
    "many different removal strategies have been developed for various purposes , e.g. , mimicking the real world network failures , improving the effectiveness of network disintegration , etc .",
    "examples include random removal ( rr ) strategy , the high degree removal ( hdr ) strategy and the high betweenness centrality removal strategy ( hbr )  @xcite .",
    "note that the best strategy for fragmentation ( minimum nodes removal ) is also the best for immunization since it represent the minimum number of nodes or links needed to be immunized so that epidemic can not spread in the network .",
    "recently , a new measure of fragmentation has been developed in social network studies  @xcite . given a fully connected network of @xmath7 nodes which is fragmented into separate clusters  @xcite by removing @xmath8 nodes following a certain strategy .",
    "we define @xmath9 the concentration of nodes removed and @xmath10 the concentration of existing nodes .",
    "the degree of fragmentation @xmath0 of the network is defined as the ratio between the number of pairs of nodes that are not connected in the fragmented network and the total number of pairs in the original fully connected network .",
    "suppose that after removal there are @xmath11 clusters in the fragmented network , since all members of a cluster are , by definition , mutually reachable , the measure @xmath0 can be written as follows  @xcite @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the number of nodes in cluster @xmath14 , @xmath11 is number of clusters in the fragmented network , and @xmath7 the number of nodes in the original fully connected network . for an undamaged network , @xmath15 .",
    "for a totally fragmented network , @xmath16 . the quantity @xmath17 defined in eq .",
    "( [ f_def ] ) can be regarded as the `` connectivity '' of the network . when @xmath18 the network is fully connected while for @xmath19 it is fully fragmented .    in this paper , we study the statistical behavior of @xmath20 using both analytical and numerical methods and relate it to the traditional measure of fragmentation , the relative size of the largest cluster , @xmath2 , used in percolation theory . in this way , we are able to obtain analytical results for the fragmentation @xmath0 of networks .",
    "we study three removal strategies : the _ random removal ( rr ) strategy _ which removes randomly selected nodes , the _ high degree removal ( hdr ) strategy _ which targets and removes nodes with highest degree and the _ high betweenness centrality removal ( hbr ) strategy _ which targets and removes nodes with highest betweenness centrality .",
    "the hdr ( or hbr ) strategies first removes the node with the highest degree ( or the highest betweenness centrality ) , and then the second highest and so on .",
    "these three strategies are commonly used in models representing random and targeted attacks in real world networks  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , in analogy to percolation , physicists describe the connectivity of a fragmented network by the ratio @xmath21 ( called the incipient order parameter ) between the largest cluster size @xmath22 ( called the infinite cluster ) and @xmath7 .",
    "many properties have been derived for this measure  @xcite .",
    "for example , in random networks , @xmath2 undergoes a second order phase transition at a threshold @xmath23 . below @xmath23",
    ", @xmath2 is zero for @xmath24 , while for @xmath25 , @xmath2 is finite .",
    "this occurs for both rr and hdr in random networks and lattice networks  @xcite .",
    "the threshold parameter @xmath23 depends on the degree distribution , the network topology , and the removal strategy  @xcite .",
    "the specific way that @xmath2 approaches zero at @xmath23 depends on the network topology and removal strategy but not on details such as @xmath23 . in scale",
    "free networks , where the degree distribution @xmath26 and @xmath27 , it has been found that @xmath28 for rr strategy  @xcite while @xmath23 is very high for hdr strategy  @xcite and for hbr strategy  @xcite . for @xmath29 and rr , @xmath23 is finite .",
    "next , we show simulation results of removing nodes in all strategies ( rr , hdr and hbr ) on er and scale free networks . fig .",

    "[ f_kill](a ) , the transition in fig .",
    "[ f_kill](b ) is not as sharp and therefore @xmath17 and @xmath2 do not show a collapse together .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath33 there is no transition at @xmath34  @xcite and for @xmath35 , @xmath2 falls much less sharply compared to er  @xcite .",
    "for hdr shown in figs .",
    "[ f_kill](c),(d ) , the transition is again sharp since after removing high degree nodes , the network becomes similar to er networks , which do not have high degree nodes  @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior is seen for hbr shown in figs .",
    "[ f_kill](e),(f ) due to the known high correlation between high degree nodes and high betweenness centrality nodes  @xcite .    when @xmath36 and not too close to @xmath23 , following percolation theory , the infinite cluster dominates the system and @xmath37 , i.e. most of unremoved nodes are connected .",

    "( [ f_f2 ] ) is valid .",
    "however , when @xmath44 drops close to @xmath48 , the system approaches criticality and the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath42 and @xmath2 is not as strong .",
    "this variation is attributed to the presence of clusters other than the infinite one , which influence @xmath17 but not @xmath2 .",
    "similar behavior is observed for rr strategy in sf networks with @xmath35 shown in fig .",
    "[ f_vs_f2](b ) . for @xmath35 ,",

    "no significant variation is observed even when @xmath2 is as small as @xmath51 .",
    "this observation supports that the sf networks with @xmath52 are quite robust in sustaining its infinite cluster against random removal  @xcite .",
    "[ f_vs_f2](c ) , [ f_vs_f2](d),[f_vs_f2](e ) and [ f_vs_f2](f ) show the results for hdr and hbr strategies in er and sf networks .",
    "for these targeted strategies , the variation of @xmath42 and @xmath2 shows up at significantly higher @xmath44 compared to the random case , indicating that the infinite cluster breaks down easier under hdr and hbr attacks for both er and sf networks , as seen also in fig .",
    "[ f_kill ] . at this point ,",
    "the sf network with @xmath33 becomes no longer as robust as in the random case , as can be clearly observed in the large variation at @xmath53 .    to further investigate the characteristics of the variation of @xmath17 for a given @xmath2",
    ", we calculate the probability distributions @xmath54 versus @xmath55 for a given @xmath2 where @xmath56 is the average value of @xmath17 and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f_limit ] . in this case ,",
    "@xmath57 , the most probable value of @xmath17 , is determined by the fixed infinite cluster size @xmath2 with @xmath58 , and the broadness of @xmath54 comes from presence of clusters other than the infinite one .",
    "because the largest cluster size is fixed , the upper cutoff of @xmath54 emerges due to the limitation on the sizes of other clusters that by definition must be smaller than the largest cluster . for the rr strategy ,",
    "the broadness of @xmath54 for er network is bigger than that of sf networks at the same @xmath2 , especially for @xmath59 where the system is always high above criticality and the variation is relatively small . on the contrary , for the hdr and hbr strategies ,",
    "the broadness of @xmath54 for er and sf networks are of the same order due to the fact that for hdr and hbr , @xmath23 is also finite for @xmath33 .",
    "this observation is consistent with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ f_vs_f2 ] .",
    "now we focus on the dependence of @xmath54 on the system size @xmath7 at @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ f_n ] ) . from percolation theory and for er under rr strategy ,",

    "[ f_n]b supports this scaling relationship .",

    "[ f_n]b ) using the scaling form of eq .  ( [ eq_pf_n ] ) .",
    "the er networks and the sf networks that we have been studying are random ensemble of networks which are only determined by their degree distribution . it is known that many real networks often exhibit important structural properties relevant for percolation properties such as high level of clustering , assortativity and fractality that random networks do not exhibit  @xcite .",
    "we therefore test our results about the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath2 on an example of a large real social network .",
    "the network we use is extracted from a data set obtained from statistics sweden  @xcite and consists of all geographical workplaces in sweden that can be linked with each other by having at least one employee from each workplace sharing the same household .",
    "household is defined as a married couple or a couple having kids together that are living in the same flat or house .",
    "unmarried couples without kids and other individuals sharing household are not registered in the dataset as households .",
    "this kind of network have been shown to be of importance for the spreading of influenza  @xcite and are also likely to be important for spreading of information and rumors in society .",
    "the network consists of @xmath68 nodes ( workplaces ) and @xmath69 links ( employees sharing the same households ) and , as shown in fig .",

    "the jump of the largest cluster from @xmath80 to @xmath83 from @xmath84 nodes to @xmath85 nodes ( i.e. @xmath86 nodes ) is due to nodes which are connected only to the nucleus .",
