    "in order to calculate characteristics of nuclear reactions with gamma - rays , information on the photon strength function ( psf ) and nuclear level density ( nld ) models is necessary .",
    "traditionally , these quantities have been modeled phenomenologically and the corresponding parameters adjusted on stable nuclei .",
    "such information is needed to calculate all characteristics of nuclear reactions with gamma - rays , in particular , the radiative neutron capture cross sections of particular interest in astrophysical @xcite and nuclear engineering @xcite applications . commonly , one parametrizes the psf phenomenologically using , for example , lorentzian - type models @xcite",
    ". the usual definition of psf contains transitions between excited states . for this reason , in order to calculate the psf , the known brink hypothesis @xcite is often used which states that on each excited state it is possible to build a giant dipole resonance ( at present , any giant resonance ) including its low - lying part . in the low - lying energy region",
    ", there exists the so - called pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) .",
    "it exhausts typically about 1 - 2% of the energy weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) but , nevertheless , it can significantly increase the radiative neutron capture cross section and affect the nucleosynthesis of neutron - rich nuclei by the r - process @xcite . in neutron - rich nuclei , for example ,",
    "@xmath2ni @xcite and , probably , @xmath3ni , the pdr fraction of the ewsr is expected to be much larger . note that for nuclei with small neutron separation energy , less than typically 34 mev , the pdr properties are changed significantly @xcite , and therefore , phenomenological systematics obtained by fitting characteristics of stable nuclei can not be applied . through the brink hypothesis @xcite",
    ", the de - excitation psf is directly connected to the photoabsorption cross section and , therefore , with the pdr field @xcite .",
    "for all these reasons , during the last decade there has been an increasing interest in the investigations of the excitations in the pdr energy region manifested both in `` pure '' low - energy nuclear physics @xcite and in the nuclear data field @xcite .",
    "the experiments in the pdr energy region @xcite have given additional information about the pdr and psf structures .",
    "the psf structures at 89 mev in six sn isotopes obtained by the oslo method @xcite could not be explained within the standard phenomenological approach . in order to explain the experiment , it was necessary to add `` by hand '' some additional low - lying strength of about 12% of the ewsr .    given the importance of psf both in astrophysics @xcite and nuclear engineering @xcite , microscopic investigations are required , especially when extrapolations to exotic nuclei are needed . mean - field approaches using effective nucleon interactions , such as the hartree - fock bogoliubov method and the quasi - particle random - phase approximation ( hfb+qrpa ) @xcite , allow systematic self - consistent studies of isotopic chains , and for this reason have been included in modern nuclear reaction codes like empire @xcite or talys @xcite .",
    "such an approach is of higher predictive power in comparison with phenomenological models .",
    "however , as we discuss below , and as confirmed by recent experiments , the hfb+qrpa approach is necessary but not sufficient . to be exact ,",
    "it should be complemented by the effect describing the interaction of single - particle degrees of freedom with the low - lying collective phonon degrees of freedom , known as the phonon coupling ( pc ) .",
    "the results in ref .",
    "@xcite directly confirm the necessity to go beyond the hfb+qrpa method because the psf structures observed in ref .",
    "@xcite could not be explained within the hfb+qrpa approach . in particular",
    ", the pc effects discussed in refs.@xcite may be at the origin of such an extra strength .",
    "note that the microscopic psfs which contained transitions between the ground and excited states , i.e. the psfs values at the energy point near the neutron separation energy , have already been estimated long ago within the quasiparticle - phonon model approach , which also includes the pc @xcite .",
    "there are also some additional questions for double - magic nuclei .",
    "the problem is that the phenomenological approaches  smooth  the individual characteristics of these nuclei or consider them on average .",
    "individual peculiarities are especially expressive just for double - magic nuclei , even for stable , not to mention unstable ones . for example , to include the vibrational nld enhancement to the well - known generalized superfluid model ( gsm ) @xcite , the experimental values for the energies of the first 2@xmath4 and the approximate @xmath5 mev energies for the first 3@xmath6 levels are usually considered .",
    "such a formula is however not suited for double - magic nuclei , and both these prescriptions should not be used for unstable nuclei .",
    "microscopic approaches in nuclear theory account for the specificity of each nucleus through its single - particle and collective ( phonon ) properties .",
    "therefore , it allows for some irregular changes in comparison with global phenomenological models @xcite to be seen and checked .",
    "thus , for double - magic nuclei it is especially necessary to use microscopic approaches for both the psf and nld .",
    "many different nld models have been developed for the last decades and in many respect nld predictions are still not satisfactory , especially in view of their importance in reaction modelling .",
    "the shortcomings of analytical nld formulae in matching experimental data are overcome , as a rule , by empirical parameter adjustments .",
    "for this reason , their predictive power away from experimental constraints is questionable in contrast to more microscopic approaches that have been seriously developed for the last decades .",
    "the present paper also reviews the last attempt made to improve microscopic nld models for practical applications .    in this work",
    "we discuss and compare i ) the microscopic and phenomenological psf models , ii ) the corresponding radiative nuclear reaction characteristics , namely , the neutron radiative capture cross sections , the corresponding capture @xmath7-ray spectra and average radiative widths , iii ) phenomenological and microscopic nld models required for calculations of these radiative nuclear reaction characteristics .",
    "to estimate psfs , we use the self - consistent version of the extended theory of finite fermi systems ( etffs ) @xcite in the quasi - particle time blocking approximation ( qtba ) @xcite .",
    "our etffs ( qtba ) method , or simply qtba , includes self - consistently the qrpa and pc effects and the single - particle continuum in a discrete form .",
    "details of the method are described in ref .",
    "the method allows us to investigate the impact of the pc on nuclear reaction in both stable and unstable nuclei .",
    "we calculate the microscopic psfs in several sn and ni isotopes as well as ( due to their above - mentioned specificities ) in the doubly - magic nuclei @xmath0sn and @xmath1pb and use them in the empire and talys codes to estimate the neutron capture cross sections , the corresponding capture gamma - ray spectra and the average radiative widths . finally , in view of the importance of nld in reaction theory , a review on the last developments made to determine nld within the mean field plus combinatorial model is given in sect .",
    "[ sect_nld ] .",
    "the strength function @xmath8 @xcite , related to the psf @xmath9 by @xmath10 = 3.487\\cdot10^{-7 } s(\\omega)[{\\rm fm}^2{\\rm mev}^{-1}]$ ] , is calculated by the qtba method @xcite on the basis of the sly4 skyrme force @xcite .",
    "the ground state is calculated within the hfb method using the spherical code hfbrad  @xcite . the residual interaction for the ( q)rpa and qtba calculations",
    "is derived as the second derivative of the skyrme functional . in all our calculations we use a smoothing parameter of 200 kev which effectively accounts for correlations beyond the considered pc .",
    "such a choice guarantees a proper description of all three characteristics of giant resonances , including the width @xcite , and also corresponds to the experimental resolution of the oslo method @xcite .",

    "i ) _ in contrast to phenomenological models , the structure patterns caused by both the qrpa and pc effects are pronounced in both sn and ni isotopes . physically , the pc structures are caused by the poles at @xmath14 or @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are single - particle , quasi - particle and phonon energies , respectively .",

    "the agreement of the @xmath24 values with experiment is found to deteriorate if use is made of the eglo or qrpa strengths , but also of the gsm nld .",
    "one can also see that for stable nuclei , the combinatorial nld model results are in a better agreement with the systematics @xcite than those obtained with the gsm model .",
    "as far as the eglo model is concerned , we see that similar conclusions can be drawn .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental data are very scarce for the doubly - magic nuclei @xmath0sn and @xmath1pb . however , as shown in table [ tab-3 ] , we find , for @xmath1pb , a reasonable agreement between empire predictions and the @xmath24 systematics @xcite , at least with the hfb + combinatorial nld model , not with gsm one ( nor with the empire - specific nld ) . for the average resonance s - wave level spacings @xmath34 , gsm gives 0.0044  kev , empire - specfic model 32  kev and hfb+combinatorial model 37.6 , the two last to being in agreement with the experimental value of @xmath35  kev .",

    "since bethe s pioneering work @xcite , many studies have been devoted to the evaluation of the nld .",
    "the so - called partition function method is by far the most widely used technique for calculating level densities , particularly in view of its ability to provide simple analytical formulae . in its simplest form , the nld is evaluated for a gas of non - interacting fermions confined to the nuclear volume and having equally spaced energy levels .",
    "such a model corresponds to the zeroth order approximation of a fermi gas model and leads to very simple analytical , though unreliable , expressions for the nld .    in an attempt to reproduce the experimental data , various phenomenological modifications to the original analytical formulation of bethe",
    "have been suggested , in particular to allow for shell , pairing and collective effects .",
    "this led first to the constant temperature formula , then to the shifted fermi gas model , and later to the popular back - shifted fermi gas ( bsfg ) model  @xcite . to describe the shell effect , other empirical or phenomenological improvements to the fermi formula",
    "have been attempted by introducing an energy dependence to the shell energy shift @xcite . to account for a more realistic pairing correction ,",
    "analytical expressions have been derived from the bcs formulation , but at the expense of numerous approximations @xcite .",
    "this includes the gsm approach @xcite or the semi - classical approximation @xcite .",
    "in such an analytical approach , collective rotational and/or vibrational effects are often not treated explicitly .    some attempts to include all the shell , pairing and deformation effects analytically in the nld formula",
    "are found in refs .",
    "however , drastic approximations are usually made in deriving such analytical nld formulae and their shortcomings in matching experimental data are overcome by empirical parameter adjustments . for practical applications ,",
    "the available experimental information can not be omitted and global formulae are tuned by a local determination of the free parameters for each nucleus .",
    "to do so , the nld formula is renormalized on existing experimental data ( mainly low - lying levels and s - wave neutron resonance spacings ) .",
    "so far , only simple analytical formulae of the bsfg type have been renormalized and used in practical applications @xcite .",
    "several of the approximations used to obtain the nld expressions in an analytical form can be avoided by quantitatively taking into account the discrete structure of the single - particle spectra associated with realistic effective potentials .",
    "this approach leads to the so - called microscopic statistical model ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the nld computed with this technique is the exact result that the analytical approximation tries to reproduce .",
    "this approach has the advantage of treating in a natural way shell , pairing and deformation effects on all the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "however , the statistical model is not free from uncertainties .",
    "in particular some inherent problems related to the choice of the single - particle configuration and pairing force remain .",
    "the treatment of the collective enhancement factor as well as the deformation effects at increasing energies and for transient nuclei are usually treated in a phenomenological way .",
    "the global microscopic nld prescription within the statistical approach based on the hartree - fock - bcs ( hfbcs ) ground state properties  @xcite has proven the capacity of microscopic models to compete with phenomenological models in the reproduction of experimental data and consequently to be adopted for practical applications .",
    "however , this statistical approach still presents the drawback of not describing the parity dependence of the nld , nor the discrete ( i.e non - statistical ) nature of the excited spectrum at low energies .",
    "other various microscopic models have been proposed , including , for example , the combinatorial model @xcite , the spectral distribution approach @xcite , monte - carlo @xcite and quantum monte - carlo models , including correlations beyond the mean - field approximation @xcite . among those",
    ", the combinatorial approach has been the most developed so far and it was demonstrated that such an approach can clearly compete with the statistical approach in the global reproduction of experimental data @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is to provide not only the energy , spin and parity dependence of the nld , but also the partial particle - hole level density that can not be extracted in any satisfactory way from the statistical approaches . at low energies , the combinatorial predictions also provide the non - statistical limit where by definition the statistical approach can not be applied .",
    "the combinatorial method consists in using the single - particle level schemes obtained from constrained axially symmetric hfb method to construct incoherent particle - hole ( ph ) state densities as functions of the excitation energy , the spin projection ( on the intrinsic symmetry axis of the nucleus ) and the parity .",
    "once these incoherent ph state densities are determined , collective effects have to be included . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the choice was made to describe the vibrational effects by multiplying the total level densities by a phenomenological enhancement factor @xcite once rotational bands had been constructed .",
    "the resulting nld were found to reproduce very well the available experimental data ( i.e. both the cumulated low energy discrete level histograms and the s- and p - wave resonances mean spacings at the neutron binding energy ) .",
    "however , it was clear that the phenomenological treatment of vibrational effects needs to be replaced by a sounder treatment .",
    "indeed , rotational bands built on purely vibrational band - heads are well established and can clearly not be described if the vibrational enhancement occur once the rotational bands are constructed as done in ref .",
    "feedback from fission cross section calculations also suggested this lack of vibrational states at low energies  @xcite .    to improve the reliability of the microscopic prediction of nld , the vibrational enhancement factor was later included in the combinatorial approach explicitly by allowing for phonon excitations using the boson partition function of ref .",
    "@xcite which includes quadrupole , octupole as well as hexadecapole vibrational modes .",
    "whereas single - particle levels are theoretically obtained for any nucleus , phonon s energies are taken from experimental information when available or from analytical expressions  @xcite .",
    "once the vibrational and incoherent ph state densities are computed , they are folded to deduce the total state and the level densities are then deduced exactly like in ref .",
    "@xcite . to account for the damping of vibrational effects at increasing energies",
    ", the folding was restricted to the ph configurations having a total exciton number ( i.e. the sum of the number of proton and neutron particles and proton and neutron holes ) @xmath36 .",
    "this restriction stems from the fact that a vibrational state results from a coherent excitation of particles and holes , and that this coherence vanishes with increasing number of ph involved in the description .",
    "therefore , if one deals with a ph configuration having a large exciton number , one should not simultaneously account for vibrational states which are clearly already included as incoherent excitations .",
    "the combinatorial model was further improved @xcite for deformed nuclei by taking into account the transition to sphericity coherently on the basis of a temperature - dependent hartree - fock calculation .",
    "this approach provides at each temperature the structure properties needed to build the level densities .",
    "the derived nlds were shown to provide fairly good results when compared with experimental data @xcite .    as an illustration of the different predictions , we compare in fig .",

    "are obtained over the whole nuclear chart where data is available . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the hfb plus combinatorial model also gives satisfactory extrapolations to low energies , in particular with respect to the measured cumulative number of levels and the total level density extracted by the oslo group from the analysis of particle-@xmath7 coincidence in the ( @xmath37he,@xmath38 ) and ( @xmath37he,@xmath37he@xmath7 ) reactions @xcite .",

    "no simple analytical fit to the tabulated nld is given to avoid losing the specific microscopic characteristics of the model .",

    "@xcite.,width=340 ]    one major advantage of the combinatorial method is its non - statistical feature which enables to obtain realistic parity and spin distributions , especially at low energies where the statistical limit fails .",
    "another advantage lies in the parity dependence which can hardly be estimated within the statistical approach .",
    "it should be noted that the non - equipartition of parities can have a non - negligible impact , in particular on radiative capture cross sections  @xcite . concerning the spin distribution , the combinatorial approach provides with nld that may significantly deviate from the usually adopted wigner law , in particular at low energy since the number of levels is not high enough to reach a gaussian distribution .",
    "such deviations can play a key role when considering the decay to spin isomers at low energies  @xcite , since high - spin populations are usually underestimated within the statistical approach , leading to an underestimate of the decaying probability to high spin levels . yet , the combinatorial method can still be improved to better account for collective effects , especially at increasing excitation energies .",
    "a first attempt has been made to account for the variations of nuclear structure properties with increasing excitation energy thanks to a temperature - dependent hfb calculation @xcite .",

    "<S> a survey of some results in the modern microscopic theory of properties of nuclear reactions with gamma - rays is given . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we discuss the impact of phonon coupling ( pc ) on the photon strength function ( psf ) because it represents the most natural physical source of additional strength found for sn isotopes in recent experiments that could not be explained within the standard hfb+qrpa approach . the self - consistent version of the extended theory of finite fermi systems in the quasiparticle time blocking approximation , or simply qtba , is applied . </S>",
    "<S> it uses the hfb mean field and includes both the qrpa and pc effects on the basis of the sly4 skyrme force . with our microscopic e1 psfs </S>",
    "<S> , the following properties have been calculated for many stable and unstable even - even semi - magic sn and ni isotopes as well as for double - magic @xmath0sn and @xmath1pb using the reaction codes empire and talys with several nuclear level density ( nld ) models : 1 ) the neutron capture cross sections , 2 ) the corresponding neutron capture gamma spectra , 3 ) the average radiative widths of neutron resonances . in all the properties considered , the pc contribution turned out to be significant , as compared with the standard qrpa one , and necessary to explain the available experimental data . the results with the phenomenological so - called generalized superfluid nld model turned out to be worse , on the whole , than those obtained with the microscopic hfb+combinatorial nld model . the very topical question about the m1 resonance contribution to psfs </S>",
    "<S> is also discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also discuss the modern microscopic nld models based on the self - consistent hfb method and show their relevance to explain experimental data as compared with the phenomenological models . </S>",
    "<S> the use of these self - consistent microscopic approaches is of particular relevance for nuclear astrophysics , but also for the study of double - magic nuclei . </S>"
