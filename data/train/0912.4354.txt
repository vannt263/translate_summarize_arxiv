    "ngc3801 is a nearby e / s0 galaxy at a distance of @xmath147.9 mpc , with the body of the galaxy being crossed by two main dust features ( heckman et al .",
    "1986 ; verdoes kleijn et al .",
    "a warped dust lane lies along the optical minor axis while patchy dust filaments are seen on the eastern and western halves of the galaxy . at brightness levels",
    "@xmath2@xmath123@xmath324 mag arcsec@xmath4 , the galaxy shows a hysteresis loop like structure while at even fainter levels , a boxy isophotal structure is seen ( heckman et al .",
    "it hosts a small radio galaxy with an angular size of @xmath150 arcsec ( 11 kpc ) , whose jet axis is almost orthogonal to the rotation axis of the stellar component or orthogonal to the minor - axis dust lane ( heckman et al .",
    "millimetre - wave observations have helped identify a radio core and clumps of co(1@xmath30 ) emission suggesting a r@xmath12 kpc circum - nuclear rotating gas disk orthogonal to stellar rotation and perpendicular to the radio jet ( das et al .",
    "_ chandra _ observations reveal shock - heated shells of hot gas surrounding the radio lobes ( croston , kraft , & hardcastle 2007 ) .",
    "hi observations with the arecibo telescope show gas in both emission and absorption , but higher resolution observations are required to determine its distribution and kinematics ( heckman et al . 1983 ) .",
    "we present the first ever imaging study in hi , dust , uv and pa@xmath5 emission .",
    "figure 1 shows the radio continuum image superimposed on an optical dss blue - band image in the left panel and the total intensity hi image superimposed on the 8.0 @xmath0 m dust / pah emission image from the _ spitzer _ on the right panel .",
    "the dust emission shows a prominent linear feature nearly orthogonal to the jet in the central region ( r@xmath12 kpc ) .",
    "we found that both the 8.0 @xmath0 m dust / pah emission and uv emission from _ galex _ show similar @xmath130 kpc wide s - shaped structure , representing young massive star formation in it .",
    "our hi - emission study with the vla shows emission blobs on the eastern ( mostly red - shifted ) and western ( blue - shifted ) sides , roughly coinciding with the tails of the s - shaped structure ( figure 1 , right panel ) .",
    "these hi results suggest a rotating gas disk ( v@xmath6@xmath1280 km s@xmath7 ) , with velocities nearly twice than that of the stars ( cf .",
    "heckman et al . 1985 ) .",
    "in addition , broad , faint , blue - shifted absorption wing and an hi absorption clump associated with the shocked shell around the eastern lobe are seen , possibly due to jet - driven outflow . due to its similarity with kinematically decoupled cores and other properties , we propose that a merger between a gas - rich spiral galaxy and an elliptical galaxy has triggered its agn activity and has shaped its stellar , gaseous and radio - jet structures .",
    "detailed stellar population synthesis studies to understand its time evolution are in progress .",
