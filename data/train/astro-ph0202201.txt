    "clusters and groups of galaxies contain a large amount of hot gas , besides galaxies and the gravitationally dominant dark matter . this hot x - ray - emitting gas known as",
    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) represents a part of the baryonic matter of the universe that is not associated with individual galaxies but remains trapped in the deeper gravitational potential of galaxy clusters .",
    "hierarchical models of structure formation have been very successful in explaining many observed properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "nevertheless , some puzzling problems remain open and unexplained .",
    "models of cluster formation in which the intergalactic gas simply falls into the dark matter dominated gravitational potential well ( so - called infall models ) fail to reproduce all the structural properties of the local cluster population ( e.g. , evrard & henry 1991 ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; mohr & evrard 1997 ; bryan & norman 1998 ) .",
    "there is certainly some additional physics driving icm evolution .",
    "recent x - ray observations have provided evidences for some non - gravitational heating of the diffuse , high density baryons in the potential wells of groups and clusters of galaxies , in addition to the heating during the gravitational collapse .",
    "one of the first evidences was in the shape of the @xmath1 relation , which is steeper than the self - similar behaviour @xmath2 predicted in the case of gravitational processes only .",
    "as early as the emergence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 data , several authors proposed that the missing element is the existence of a  preheated high - entropy \" intergalactic gas prior to a cluster s collapse ( david 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ; kaiser 1991 ; white 1991 ) .",
    "later , ponman ( 1999 ) , and lloyd - davies ( 2000 ) found direct evidence of an entropy excess with respect to the level expected from gravitational heating in the centre of groups . ignoring the constant and logarithms",
    ", one can define the `` entropy '' as @xmath5 .",
    "the excess entropy , or equivalently , the excess specific energy , flattens the density profile decreasing the x - ray luminosity which is proportional to the square of the density .",
    "the effect is stronger in poorer clusters , where the excess energy associated with the excess entropy is comparable to the gravitational binding energy , while rich clusters , where gravity is dominant , are mostly unaffected .",
    "this produces a steepening of the @xmath1 relation .",
    "the most popular scenario to successfully explain these thermal properties of the icm has been the  preheating \" scenario . for this scenario ,",
    "the candidate processes which have been looked into are strong galactic winds driven by supernovae .",
    "however valgeas & silk ( 1999 ) showed that the energy provided by supernovae can not raise the entropy of intergalactic medium ( igm ) up to the level required by current observations .",
    "the observed amount of required energy injection depends on the epoch , and have been in the range of 0.4 - 3 kev per gas particle ( navarro et al .",
    "1995 ; cavaliere et al . 1997 ; balogh et al.1999 ; wu et al .",
    "2000 ; lloyd - davies 2000 , borgani 2001 ) .",
    "for example , wu ( 2000 ) showed that galactic winds can impart only @xmath6 kev per particle .",
    "moreover , kravtsov & yepes ( 2000 ) estimated the energy provided by supernovae from the observed metal abundance of icm and found that the heating only by supernovae driven outflows requires unrealistically high efficiency",
    ". on the other hand , quasar outflows may be much more powerful and plausible candidates of the heating ( valageas & silk 1999 ) . in this paper , we focus on the role of quasar outflows in this regard .",
    "the epoch of the energy input also remains uncertain .",
    "lloyd - davies ( 2000 ) put an upper limit of @xmath7 on the preheating epoch , from their estimate of excess entropy in groups . for agns ,",
    "there have been no additional constraints like the metal abundance in the case of supernova heating ( kaiser & alexander 1999 ) .",
    "recently , yamada & fujita ( 2001 ) have looked into the deformation of the cosmic microwave background ( the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ) by hot electrons produced at the shocks produced by jets from agns .",
    "they showed that the observed excess entropy of icm and @xmath8 upper limit for compton @xmath9-parameter are compatible with each other only when the heating by jets occurred at relatively small redshift ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus they questioned the  preheating \" scenario as their result suggests that the heating occurred simultaneously with or after cluster formation .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the heat input from quasar outflows inside clusters .",
    "we calculate the mechanical work done by various kinds of quasar outflows and the excess energy imparted by them onto the intracluster medium via pdv work . for the statistics of quasars inside clusters",
    ", we use the extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "finally we calculate the excess energy per particle and tally them with available observations .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the abundance of quasars inside clusters of a given mass .",
    "we then discuss the evolution of quasar outflows and the mechanical work done by them in  3 .",
    "we use these concepts to calculate the heating of the icm in  4 .",
    "we then discuss the implications of our results in  5 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a flat universe with a cosmological constant , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "for a proper evaluation of the heat input from quasars inside clusters , one first needs to calculate their abundance and its dependence on the quasar mass , cluster mass , and the cluster formation redshift .",
    "observationally , it is still difficult to obtain good statistics of quasars inside clusters .",
    "estimation of the galaxy - qso correlation function have shown that at low redshifts ( @xmath13 ) , quasars typically reside in small to moderate groups of galaxies and not in rich galaxies ( e.g. , bahcall & chokshi 1991 ; fisher 1996 ) .",
    "it is still uncertain whether or not their optical or radio luminosities depend on their environments . some studies ( e.g. , ellingson , yee & green 1991 ) have shown that radio - loud quasars preferentially reside in richer clusters at higher redshift , although more recent studies ( e.g. , wold 2001 ) do not find any such correlation .",
    "there has been , however , considerable work in relating the observed quasar luminosity function or the radio luminosity function ( for radio - loud quasars ) with the mass function of galaxies as prescribed by the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism ( e.g. , haehnelt & rees 1993 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; yamada , sugiyama & silk 1999 ) .    at @xmath14 ,",
    "yamada , sugiyama & silk found that one can reproduce the abundance of the radio sources powered by agns ( i.e. , leaving aside the radio sources powered by starbursts ) by assuming that a fraction @xmath15 of the halos from ps formalism become radio - loud quasars , where , @xmath16 for @xmath17 m@xmath18 , and @xmath19 for @xmath20 m@xmath18 .",
    "they assume an upper limit on @xmath21 of @xmath22 m@xmath18 .",

    "yamada , sugiyama & silk ( 1999 ) assumed this fraction to be a constant for all redshifts . in this model , the rate of formation of quasars is given by the derivative of the ps mass function at the relevant mass scale .",
    "this is similar to the model adopted by haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) and furlanetto & loeb ( 2001 ; fl01 ) .",
    "fl01 showed that at high redshift ( @xmath28 ) the rate of formation of quasars is a fraction @xmath25 of the rate of formation of halos from ps formalism , if a life time of order @xmath29 yr is assumed for the quasar .",
    "there is , however , a difference , in that they had only a lower limit to @xmath21 and no upper limits ( see eqns ( 2 ) & ( 3 ) of haiman & loeb 1998 ) .",
    "they mention that at low redshifts their formalism does not predict any decline as observed in reality , and for which they consider their model only at high redshift .",
    "it is possible that this mismatch is due to the lack of upper limits , since the the differentiation of ps mass function for objects with an upper limit in mass decreases at low redshift , ( haiman , z. 2001 , private communications ) . in any case",
    ", haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) found that this prescription yields a matching quasar luminosity function that is observed , at redshift @xmath30 .",
    "we find later that most of the heating of the icm gas ( even for our least massive cluster ) occurs at @xmath31 ( figure 7 )",
    ". we will therefore assume for simplicity that this fraction @xmath25 at all redshifts ( as in yamada 1999 ) . in this paper",
    ", we would like to have a conservative estimate of the quasar abundance .",
    "also , we would like to calculate the abundance of quasars in clusters including low mass groups of galaxies .",
    "for this reason , we assume the value of @xmath32 as above , but use an upper limit of @xmath33 m@xmath18 .",

    "we are , however , concerned with the statistics of quasars _ inside _ clusters .",
    "for this one needs to have an extension of the ps mass function which can predict the probability of a given halo becoming a part of bigger object later , or the probability of an object having had a progenitor of a given mass at an earlier epoch .",
    "such extensions of the ps theory have been studied in detail by bower ( 1991 ) and lacey & cole ( 1993 ) , for example .    in the standard ps theory , the mass function , i.e.",
    ", the fraction of regions with mass in the range @xmath34 which have overdensity @xmath35 in excess of @xmath36 ( which is the threshold for perturbations becoming non - linear ) , is given by , f_ps = f(m,_c ) dm=-1 _ c ( _ m^2)^3/2 dm . [",

    "the fraction of regions of mass @xmath38 , contained within a larger scale region of mass @xmath41 and overdensity @xmath42 , which are more overdense than @xmath36 , is given by , f(m,_c m ,  ) dm & & = -1 ( _ c -  ) ( _ m^2 - _ m^2)^3/2 + & & dm . [ eq : ps3 ] this expression recovers the simple ps mass function in the limit @xmath43 and @xmath44 , relevant for the whole universe .    if we then identify @xmath41 with @xmath45 , the mass of a cluster , and @xmath46 , the threshold overdensity of the cluster at its formation epoch @xmath47 , we can then obtain the mass fraction of @xmath45 which have been parts of progenitors of a given mass range ( @xmath38 to @xmath48 ) at a given ( earlier ) redshift .",

    ". a simple differentiation will , however , not give the correct result , since there will be a negative contribution from the merging of halos out of this mass range .",
    "one would get a negative rate of formation of such quasars at some point if the rate at which they disappear beyond this mass limit is not taken into account in a proper manner .",

    "if the contribution of @xmath57 is neglected , one would then incorrectly get a negative value of @xmath56 .",
    "this problem has been encountered in the case of ordinary ps function by many authors .",
    "while studying the rate of mergers in the context of background radiation from starbursts and agns , blain & longair ( 1993 ) noted that a simple differentiation of the ps function leads to a negative rate of formation of objects in a given mass range .",

    "we note here that in the case of the merger of a lower mass quasar into a more massive quasar , our implicit assumption is that the central black holes also merge and form a bigger black hole appropriate for the bigger quasar ( see below ; eqn [ eq : bh ] ) .",
    "in other words , we assume that the central black hole mass always traces the halo mass .    the rate at which an object of mass @xmath38 at epoch @xmath62 merges to form a bigger object of mass @xmath41 is given by ( bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) , ( m m z ) dm & = & 1 _ m^2 _ m^2(_m^2 - _ m^2)^3/2 + & & + & & dm .",

    "motivated by the extension of the ps formalism , we here posit that the rate of disappearance of objects inside a bigger object also has the same form , with @xmath73 in eqn ( [ eq : int ] ) being replaced by @xmath74 .",

    "comparison with the solid line ( for @xmath79 m@xmath18 ) shows that the formation rate of these galaxies inside a lower massive cluster is larger .",
    "this follows simply from the extension of the ps formalism ( from the dependence on the term @xmath83 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is consistent with the suggestion from observation that quasars are preferentially located in groups of galaxies instead of rich clusters ( e.g. , bahcall & chokshi 1991 ; fisher 1996 ) .",

    "we next discuss the energy input from individual outflows , which we will combine with our calculation of formation rate of quasars for the final result .",
    "in this section we calculate the energy input from quasar outflows into the ambient medium .",
    "we model the outflows as they evolve in the ambient medium and calculate the pdv work done by the outflows . to begin with ,",
    "we discuss different kinds of outflows that we consider and the characteristics of the hosts of quasars .",
    "we consider two major types of quasar outflows . for radio - loud quasars ( rlq ) ,",
    "the outflow is in the form of a tightly collimated jet , which deposits energetic particles into a cocoon which expands against the surrounding medium .",
    "these outflows are characterised by the kinetic luminosity of the jet , @xmath89 . according to willot ( 1999 ) ,",
    "this is correlated with the bolometric luminosity @xmath90 of the quasar , and that @xmath91 .",
    "we follow fl01 in arguing that since @xmath92 ( elvis ( 1994 ) ) , the rest - frame b - band luminosity , @xmath93 .",
    "radio - loud quasars , however , constitute only about @xmath94 of the total population of quasars ( stern 2000 ) .",
    "we therefore define a factor @xmath95 for the fraction of quasars with outflows , and define @xmath96 for our rlq model .",
    "the fraction @xmath95 here denotes the number of radio relics / lobes per halo , since a radio loud quasar may have several outbursts of radio activity .",
    "this fraction is therefore a very conservative estimate since it is obtained from observed radio luminosity function and does not take into account the existence of radio relics in clusters .",
    "another important kind of outflows are encountered in broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars .",
    "the absorption troughs are thought to be due to absorbing clouds flowing out of the quasars with velocities up to @xmath97 .",
    "although they are encountered in about @xmath94 of the quasars , it is believed that all quasars have such outflows ( all the time ) and the covering fraction of the bal outflows is about @xmath94 ( weymann 1991 ; weymann 1997 ) .",
    "some authors also believe that bal outflows have a limited lifetime ( especially the low ionization bals ) and that they have a large covering fraction in the early phase of a quasar ( voit 1993 ) . for our calculation",
    ", we use a fraction @xmath98 for the bal outflows .",
    "we discuss the effect of the uncertainty in these factors on the final result in  5 .",
    "we model the bal outflows as having a kinetic luminosity @xmath89 . following fl01 , if @xmath99 is the column density of the absorbing gas , @xmath100 the covering fraction , and @xmath101 is the size of the absorption system , then @xmath89 is related to the outflow velocity @xmath102 as @xmath103 .",
    "the observed range of these parameters are as follows : @xmath104 , @xmath105 ( weymann 1997 ; but see above ) , @xmath106pc and @xmath107 @xmath108 ( krolik 1999 ; gallagher 1999 ) . for these values ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath89 is close to that of @xmath109 .",
    "fl01 also argued that for bal winds @xmath110 , and finally assumed @xmath93 . since this estimate depends crucially on a number of uncertain parameters ( for example , the fact that the absorption column density in optical measurement is much smaller than the above mentioned x - ray column density ) , it may not really be a conservative estimate , but it does provide a simple scaling which we hope is not too unreasonable",
    "the estimate @xmath111 is probably not a conservative estimate , but an upper limit , in that for a covering fraction of @xmath94 , the mechanical luminosity of the wind could not be larger than @xmath23 of the eddington rate . keeping all these uncertainties in mind , we assume that @xmath93 for bal outflows .",
    "we then need to connect @xmath109 of a given quasar with the properties of its halo .",
    "firstly , as haiman & loeb ( 1998 ) have shown , the mass of the black hole at the centre is related to @xmath109 , as , m_bh=1 0.093 ( l_b 1.4 10 ^ 38 erg s^-1 ) m _ [ eq : bh ] assuming that the quasar radiates at the eddington luminosity",
    ". the factor of @xmath112 reflects the fraction of the eddington luminosity radiated in the b - band , taken from the median quasar spectrum of elvis ( 1993 ) . statistically speaking",
    ", we therefore assume that a fraction @xmath32 ( eqn([eq : fq])of all black holes radiate at the eddington rate for a life time of @xmath113 yr , while the rest does not radiate at all .",
    "secondly , the correlation between the central black hole mass and the total baryonic mass of the galaxy ( magorrian 1998 ; gebhardt 2000 ) gives @xmath114 , where @xmath21 is the total mass of the galaxy , using a value of @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "as far as the collimation is concerned , the geometry of bal outflows is still uncertain , whereas the radio jets are well collimated .",
    "since some models do suggest a modest collimation even in bal outflows , with a covering fraction of @xmath105 ( weymann 1997 ) , we use the idea of collimated outflows for outflows from both radio - loud and bal quasars .",
    "we next discuss the evolution of the outflows from radio - loud quasars and calculate the fraction of its total kinetic luminosity that it deposits into the surrounding medium in the form of pdv work . for concreteness",
    ", we will assume that the corresponding fraction for bal outflows has similar values , and keep in mind the uncertainty in the geometry and energetics of bal outflows .",
    "the standard scenario for outflows from radio loud quasars involves a ` cocoon ' surrounding the core and the jet , and consisting of a shocked ambient medium and shocked jet material ( scheuer 1974 ; blandford and rees 1974 ) .",
    "begelman & cioffi ( 1989 ) constructed a simple model of the evolution of a cocoon in which the cocoon is overpressured against the icm . in their model",
    ", the expansion along the jet axis is determined by the balance of the thrust of the jet and the ram pressure , whereas the thermal pressure of the cocoon drives along the direction perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "results of numerical simulations agree with this scenario ( loken et al .",
    "1992 ; cioffi & blondin 1992 ) .    here",
    "we adopt the model of the evolution of cocoons following the approach of bicknell ( 1997 ) , which is based on the begalman & cioffi ( 1989 ) model but includes the pdv work done by the cocoon , in order to find the fraction of total energy lost by the quasar to the icm through mechanical work ( pdv work ) .",
    "bicknell ( 1997 ) derived this fraction ( @xmath117 ) to be @xmath118 , for a homogeneous ambient medium ( their equation ( 2.13 ) ) .",
    "we will , however , calculate this fraction from numerical solution of the equations governing the evolution of the cocoon , for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the derivation mentioned above implicitly assumes that the mean pressure averaged over the hotspot region is equal to the mean lobe pressure ( in the language of bicknell ( 1997 ) , this means @xmath119 ) .",
    "in fact , their equation ( 2.13 ) shows that for constant @xmath120 , one has in general , @xmath121 , which recovers the fraction @xmath122 for @xmath123 . in reality , however , this ratio does not remain a constant in time .",
    "secondly , this derivation is valid only during the period when the jet is active . even after the jet switches off ,",
    "the cocoon , however , continues to evolve as a result of its overpressure until it reaches an equilibrium pressure with the ambient medium ( see also nath 1995 ) .",
    "the cocoon , therefore , continues to do pdv work even after the jet switches off , and the inclusion of this process will lead to an upward revision of the fraction of total energy that is lost in pdv work . besides , there seems to be some confusion in the literature regarding the fraction .",
    "for example , inoue & sasaki ( 2001 ) have recently adopted a fraction @xmath124 in their calculation of energy input into the surrounding gas .",
    "we therefore calculate this fraction by numerically solving the equations of cocoon evolution .",
    "we consider two collimated steady jets advancing into the ambient icm . the thermalized jet matter and the shock - compressed icm matter form a cocoon around the jets and the cocoon expands with shocks advancing in directions",
    "both parallel and perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "after this stage of evolution , when the jet turns off after a lifetime of @xmath125 years ( kaiser 2000 ) , cocoons still retain high pressure .",
    "they cool radiatively and expand due to its overpressure till it reaches a pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium .",
    "thus the relevant equations are :    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the jet luminosity , @xmath128 is the density of the ambient medium and @xmath129 is the velocity of the jet material . as the jet is highly relativistic , @xmath130 .",
    "the averaged hotspot area @xmath131 kpc@xmath132 ( bicknell 1997 ) is assumed to be larger than the radius of the jet , according to the ` dentist s drill ' model of the jet ( scheuer 1982 ) .",
    "here @xmath133 is the length of the jet or the distance of the hotspot from the centre of the galaxy , @xmath134 is the half - width of the cocoon at the centre and @xmath135 is the volume of the cocoon given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the geometrical factor depending on the shape of the cocoon . for our calculations",
    "we have taken the shape of the cocoon as biconical and so @xmath138 .",
    "finally @xmath139 is the pressure inside the cocoon given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 is the total energy inside the cocoon given by @xmath143 till @xmath144 and @xmath145 afterwards , where @xmath146 is the lifetime of the jet .",
    "this is admittedly a simplified model of the evolution of the cocoon . in reality , after the jet switches off , one expects rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities to distort the cocoon , giving rise to ` buoyant ' plumes .",
    "this phase of the evolution of the cocoon , and its effect on the ambient medium , has been recently addressed by various authors ( gull & northover 1973 ; churazov 2000 ; brggen & kaiser 2000 ) , mainly with the help of numerical simulations .",
    "it is possible that this phase adds substantial heating to the intracluster medium , but short of doing a numerical simulation it is difficult to assess its importance .",
    "we have also neglected the loss of energy through radiation , as modeling such losses would involve detail knowledge of various parameters ( e.g. , electron energy spectrum and the possibilities of re - acceleration of electrons ) . with the uncertainties involved in modeling these process , it seems reasonable to adopt the above simplified picture as a pointer and keep the uncertainties in mind while discussing the final result . in light of this discussion",
    ", we will also calculate the final result with a value of @xmath118 as in bicknell ( 1997 ) , which we will adopt as a conservative lower limit .",
    "-4 mm    -3 mm    we numerically calculate the volume of the cocoon as it grows into the icm and the pressure inside the cocoon at each step , and add up the pdv work to get the final amount of energy lost in this mode .",
    "the evolution of the cocoon is continued until the pressure inside the cocoon becomes equal to the ambient pressure , @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) , where @xmath149 is the temperature of the icm .",
    "the fraction @xmath117 is calculated by taking the ratio of the total energy lost through mechanical work to the total energy ( that is @xmath150 ) .",
    "( we found that for the relevant values of the ambient medium parameters , the time scale to reach pressure equilibrium is always larger than @xmath146 . )",
    "the dependence of @xmath117 on the ambient density , is shown in figure 2 for @xmath151 and @xmath152 k , and for @xmath153 ( solid lines ) and @xmath154 erg / s ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the plot shows that the fraction @xmath117 is a function of temperature of the cluster and also the density of the ambient medium .",
    "the general trend is that the fraction reduces at higher temperatures and higher densities .",
    "this is because of the fact that the cocoon reaches pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium sooner for a higher pressure environment ( higher @xmath149 and @xmath155 ) , and the total pdv work ends up being smaller .",
    "the plot also shows that the fraction @xmath117 depends weakly on the jet luminosity for lower temperatures ( @xmath156 k ) , whereas there is a bit of a difference for @xmath157 k.    the fraction @xmath117 calculated above is somewhat larger than that has been used in the literature , for ambient medium with low pressure .",
    "the difference is mainly the result of our inclusion of cocoon evolution even after the jet has switched off .",
    "incidentally , inoue & sasaki ( 2001 ) , while using a value of @xmath124 , discussed the possibility that this fraction could be larger in reality , _ because _ of its continued evolution after the switching off of the jet ( their  3.2 ) .    in our calculation for the total pdv work done by bal and rlq outflows",
    ", we will use the values of @xmath117 obtained above . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the energetics and geometry of bal outflows are not clear at present . for concreteness",
    ", we have worked out the case of rlq outflows in detail , and we will use the same values of @xmath117 for bal outflows as well .",
    "equipped with the knowledge of the rate of formation of quasars in clusters ( equation [ eq : rate ] ) and the fraction of total energy which is deposited as pdv work by the outflows from them (  3.2 ) , we are now in a position to calculate the total amount of non - gravitational energy provided by quasar outflows in a cluster .",
    "if we denote the gas fraction of the total cluster mass by @xmath158 , then the total number of gas particles is @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the proton mass .",
    "it is not yet clear if the gas fraction has a universal value for clusters of all masses and at all redshifts .",
    "a few authors ( see , e.g. , schindler ( 1999 ) ) have found no correlation of the gas fraction with the cluster mass , whereas others ( e.g. , ettori & fabian ( 1999 ) ) find some correlation ( with low mass clusters possessing lower gas fraction ) .",
    "this correlation has been attributed to the excess energy deposition ( since low mass clusters are more liable to lose gas from heating than massive clusters ) ( see , e.g. , bialek ( 2000 ) ) . here , we are , however , trying to calculate the magnitude of this very excess energy",
    ". it would not be appropriate to include this correlation it a priori in our calculation .",
    "( we show later that including these correlations only increases our estimate of excess energy input . )",
    "we have , therefore , used a value of @xmath161 for our calculation . the total energy per ( gas ) particle deposited into the icm of a cluster of mass @xmath45",

    "all the curves drop to zero at low redshift because of the condition @xmath180 ( in eqn [ eq : rate ] ) . in reality",
    "the contribution to the heating should be small but non - zero , and will increase the estimate of excess energy .",

    "recently , however , lloyd - davies ( 2000 ) have shown from observations of groups of clusters that an excess energy of @xmath182 kev per particle suffices to explain the excess entropy in groups .",
    "they showed that this can explain the entropy floor for galaxy groups with temperature @xmath183 kev .",
    "borgani ( 2001 ) have also shown with the aid of numerical simulations that excess energy of order @xmath184 kev per particle reproduces the observations .",
    "the solid and dashed curves in figures 4 & 5 show that the excess energy from pdv work done by quasar outflows fall in this required range .",
    "it is seen that the excess energy per particle is larger for clusters or groups with lower temperature .",
    "this is due to two factors : ( a ) the number of quasars per unit mass is larger for smaller clusters , and ( b ) the fraction of total energy in outflows that is lost in pdv work is larger for them .",
    "we show the results in the case of a constant @xmath118 ( as in bicknell ( 1997 ) ) with dotted lines .",

    "we also show the result of the calculations for @xmath118 by the thick solid line .",
    "the data points refer to the binding energy of a ( constant ) central fraction ( @xmath186 ) of the virial mass of groups and clusters .",
    "the dashed line shows the case for self - similar models , of type @xmath187 , derived from the data points for rich clusters .",

    "the figure shows that our predictions are consistent with the data available at present .",
    "the thick line ( corresponding to @xmath118 ) falls close to the fit provided by lloyd - davies ( 2000 ) , whereas the thin line ( using @xmath117 from figure 3 ) somewhat overestimates the heat input at the low mass end .",
    "the thick line can be viewed as a conservative estimate of the heat input , since it uses @xmath118 . the thin line , however , provides an estimate of the heat input if @xmath117 is much larger than @xmath122 .",
    "we should remind ourselves here that we have calculated @xmath117 for radio galaxies and used the same values for bal outflows .",
    "if a more accurate estimate of @xmath117 for bal outflows is worked out in the future , the resulting heat input into the icm could then be scaled accordingly using figure 8 .",
    "we would like to emphasize here again that the our calculation provides a conservative estimate of the excess energy , for reasons outlined in  2 .",
    "moreover , we have used a constant density and temperature in time for the icm gas ( for clusters with a given @xmath47 ) , which is not very realistic . in reality , the density at higher redshift will be smaller , and the inclusion of a density dependent @xmath117 will only increase the estimate of excess energy ( since this fraction increases with decreasing density ) .",
    "the curves for clusters forming at different epochs show excess energies to decrease somewhat for clusters with higher formation redshift .",
    "-4 mm    -3 mm    the curves of figures 4 & 5 assume @xmath98 , which is relevant for bal outflows .",
    "the excess energy from rlq outflows will be one tenth of these curves , showing the difficulty of using radio galaxies as the only source of non - gravitational heating , if conservative estimates for their kinetic luminosities are used .",
    "recently , inoue & sasaki ( 2001 ) have used the radio luminosity functions of willot ( 2001 ) and ledlow & owen ( 1996 ) to determine the abundance of radio galaxies in clusters , and finally to estimate the total pdv work done by the cocoons of these radio galaxies .",
    "they estimated an excess energy of order @xmath190 kev per particle for rich clusters like the coma cluster , and also for poor groups , assuming that their ratio of radio galaxies per unit cluster mass is universal . from our calculation",
    ", we find an excess energy from only radio - loud quasars that is an order of magnitude _ smaller _ than their estimate .",
    "it is possible that the assumptions leading to the estimate of @xmath89 are at the source of this difference ( see , e.g. , the discussion on the uncertainty in the factor @xmath191 in their  3.2 ) .",
    "-4 mm    -3 mm    the evolution of the rate of energy input ( figure 7 ) shows that the heat input before @xmath192 is almost negligible .",
    "most of the heating occurs in the range @xmath193 .",
    "it is also clearly seen that the icm of poor groups is heated at lower redshifts , compared to the gas in massive clusters .",
    "this follows from the simple consideration that the evolution of objects in a given mass range ( here , that of the quasars ) typically occurs earlier in more massive clusters .",
    "our results , therefore , suggests that the icm in clusters were `` preheated '' , before the major mergers took place in them , whereas , the icm in groups of galaxies were heated at epochs similar to that of their formation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the energy input epoch lies below the upper limit from recent observations of lloyd - davies ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is also consistent with the limit on the range of redshifts as shown by yamada & fujita ( 2001 ) given the level of uncertainty .",
    "recently , accelerated particles from shocks as a result of the formation of clusters have been hypothesized to be the source for the diffuse gamma ray background ( loeb & waxman 2000 ) .",
    "this gamma ray production will be suppressed , however , if the gas in the clusters were heated substantially at earlier epochs ( totani & inoue 2001 ) .",
    "our results show that the icm in massive clusters were preheated ( and earlier than the icm in groups ) , and the suppression of the gamma ray production will , therefore , be an important effect , if confirmed .    finally , we discuss the uncertainties involved in our calculation . apart from the uncertainties in cosmological parameters , the major uncertainties lies in the factors @xmath32 (  2 ) ( connecting the abundances of quasars with ps mass function ) , @xmath95 ( the fraction of quasars with outflows ) , @xmath117 and @xmath158 . among these , the most uncertain factor is @xmath95 , which we have assumed to be of the order of unity for bal outflows .",
    "the uncertainty in this factor will be reflected in the uncertainty of the final heat input ( with a direct proportionality ; see eqn [ eq : final ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath117 has been already discussed earlier , and we found that even if @xmath117 is as low as @xmath122 for all cases , the final excess energy is certainly larger than that from supernovae driven winds , and is still within the required range of excess energy , especially for loose groups .",
    "as far as the uncertainty in @xmath158 is concerned , we have also done our calculation with a varying @xmath158 , e.g. , of the type , f_gas=0.15 ( 1+z)^-0.5 ( m_cl/10 ^ 15 h^-1)^0.1 , as has been advocated by ettori & fabian ( 1999 ) , and we have found that the excess energy is approximately doubled in this case .",
    "it is , however , not clear if this correlation is a result of the excess energy , and , so , it would not be appropriate to attach much significance to this result .",
    "we have also varied the lower limit in our estimate of @xmath32 ( eq . [ eq : fq ] ) and found that changing the lower limit from @xmath194 m@xmath18 to @xmath195 m@xmath18 increases the final heat input by only @xmath196 % .",
    "this is because of the fact that the increase in the number of quasars is compensated by the decrease in their mechanical luminosity .",
    "lastly , we have already discussed in detail the uncertainty in the net formation rate of quasars in clusters , and as explained in  2 , our approach here has been very conservative , and the final results should be regarded as conservative estimates in this regard .",
    "we have calculated the excess energy deposited by quasar outflows in clusters in order to explain the observations of excess entropy in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "we summarise our findings below :      \\(2 ) we have calculated the fraction of the kinetic luminosity of outflows ( rlq and bal outflows ) that is deposited onto the ambient medium , as a function of the density and temperature of the ambient medium . for outflows from radio - loud quasars , we have included the evolution of the cocoon after the jet turns off .",
    "( 3 ) the final excess energy from the mechanical work done by quasar outflows is found to be of order @xmath197 kev per particle , and is consistent with the data available at present .",
    "the excess energy in this scenario comes mainly from bal outflows , with radio galaxies supplying about a tenth of the total . keeping in mind the uncertainties in the estimate of energetics and abundances of radio and bal outflows ,",
    "we conclude that both radio galaxies and bal outflows are promising candidates for heating the icm .",
    "we found that this excess energy increases with decreasing mass of the cluster / group .",
    "this prediction could be tested with better data in the near future .",
    "the excess energy does not depend strongly on the formation redshift .",
