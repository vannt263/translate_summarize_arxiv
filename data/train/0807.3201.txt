    "the universality observed in the phase transitions is one of the most important phenomena to understand the interaction effects . for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) critical systems other than those with intrinsic anisotropy",
    ", it is pronouncedly expressed by the conformal symmetry , and the corresponding field theories are characterized by the central charge @xmath1 @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath2 , it appears to almost specify the universality class , i.e. , the possible set of the critical exponents @xcite .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath1 , there still exist considerable efforts to understand their universalities , which are possibly related to the exotic phase transitions observed in the complicated systems .",
    "it is widely known that the frustration effects sometimes bring about the critical ground states as well as the finite - temperature critical points with larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , they have been gathering great attention over the years . on another front",
    ", the multispin interactions appear to include the same effect : the exactly solved baxter - wu model consisting of the three - ising - spin product interaction is the most basic one @xcite , which belongs to the same universality class as the four - state potts ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "the ising and the four - state potts criticalities are of @xmath4 and 1 , respectively .",
    "thus , the multispin interactions can be expected as another source to bring about the larger value of @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the three - spin interaction model ( tsim ) introduced by alcaraz et al @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 denotes three sites at the corners of each elementary plaquette of the triangular lattice @xmath6 ( which consists of three sublattices @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) , then the following reduced hamiltonian expresses a class of tsim : @xmath10 the angle variables @xmath11 are located on sites , and the model parameter , the temperature @xmath12 , will be measured in units of @xmath13 .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite , we discussed an effective field theory for a related model ( i.e. , its clock version ) and predicted the one with @xmath14 , which was followed by the numerical confirmation based on the transfer - matrix calculations . here , we perform the renormalization - group ( rg ) analysis to predict the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) @xcite type phase transition between the critical and the disordered phases .",
    "in particular , we shall propose the finite - size - scaling ( fss ) ansatz for the helicity modulus representing the stiffness of the corresponding interface model @xcite .",
    "the discussion goes on in a parallel way with the @xmath15 bkt transition case @xcite , and the ansatz includes the exponent @xmath16 for the correlation length .",
    "however , since the topological defects involved ( for its definition , see below ) are not described by the scalars ( vortexes ) , but by the vectors @xcite like the burgers vectors for the dislocations in the 2d melting @xcite , some modifications occur in the rg analysis , and then bring about @xmath0 .",
    "the fss ansatz permits us to check it directly by the numerical method , and then provides solid evidence to support the theoretical prediction on the instability in the @xmath14 criticality .",
    "the fact that the system is invariant under the global spin rotations , @xmath17 , with the condition @xmath18 ( mod @xmath19 ) , is important . although this u(1)@xmath20u(1 )",
    "symmetry defined by two independent phases , say @xmath21 , is not broken and gives the low - temperature critical phase , it specifies the possible type of perturbations to bring about the high - temperature disordered phase . according to ref .",
    "[ ] , the following vector sine - gordon lagrangian density is relevant to the effective description : @xmath22 the symbol :  : denotes the normal ordering and means the subtraction of contractions of fields between them ; @xmath23 indicates the norm of the vector , and @xmath24 gives a short - distance cutoff .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 stands for the effective fugacity to control the appearance of topological defects @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 is the two component vector field attached at the position @xmath27 in the basal 2d space , so the first term represents the interface model , where @xmath28 gives its stiffness .",
    "the above symmetry is realized as the periodicity of the field , i.e. , @xmath29 @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are the normalized fundamental vectors of the so - called repeat lattice @xmath32 @xcite isomorphic to the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "then , the interface can acquire the discontinuity of the amount @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the second term consists of the vertex operators where @xmath35 , and creates the shortest discontinuities among possible ones ( i.e. , the length @xmath36 ) . from the rg viewpoint ,",
    "these topological defects controlled by @xmath25 are enough to be kept in the theory because these are the most relevant ones ( see below ) .",
    "the reason why we have started with the lagrangian density instead of the vector coulomb gas ( cg ) representation @xcite is that , for the rg analysis we shall employ the conformal field theory ( cft ) technology , which requires the scaling dimensions of local density operators and the operator - product - expansion ( ope ) coefficients among them .",
    "while details of their derivations on the gaussian fixed point ( i.e. , the first term ) will be given in our future report @xcite , here we shall summarize the relevant results to the present case . since the low - temperature critical phase corresponds to the gaussian fixed line parameterized by @xmath28 , the so - called @xmath37 operator @xcite , @xmath38 which shifts the system along the line ,",
    "is the most important one . since @xmath39 independently of @xmath28 ( @xmath40 is the distance between @xmath41 and * x * ) , it is truly marginal . on the other hand , the normalized form of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq_l ] ) is given as @xmath42 whose dimension is @xmath43 .",
    "thus , @xmath44 becomes marginal at @xmath45 @xmath46 and brings about the transition to the disordered phase for @xmath47 .",
    "for later rg argument , the expansion of the operator product @xmath48 is crucial . while there are 36 terms in the double summations with respect to the vector charges ( say @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , the following two cases are enough to be taken into account : ( i ) @xmath51 and ( ii ) @xmath52 ( the other terms are irrelevant here ) . after some calculus using the complex coordinate and employing the chiral decomposed form of fields as usual , we find that the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) mainly give @xmath37 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "then , the expression of the ope becomes as follows @xcite : @xmath53 where `` @xmath54 '' includes the unit operator and the stress tensor as well as less singular terms .",
    "consequently , we can obtain the ope coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the significance of this result is as follows : due to the triangular lattice structure of @xmath32 , three vector charges at the angle of 120 degrees to each other ( e.g. , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ) satisfy the vector charge neutrality condition , and then provide the nonzero value of @xmath60 .",
    "this brings about the difference from the bkt transition ( see below ) .",
    "now , the rg equations are derived as follows .",
    "suppose that the critical fixed point is perturbed by the marginal scalar operators @xmath61 ( normalized ) as @xmath62 , then , the rg equations for the change of the cutoff @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 within the one - loop calculations @xcite .",
    "for the present case of the couplings @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath25 , the equations become @xmath67 whereas these are similar to the bkt rg equations @xcite , the @xmath68 term emerges in the second equation due to the nonvanishing coefficient @xmath60 ( see also @xcite ) . now",
    ", we shall discuss its consequences .",
    "like to the bkt transition case , these equations possess a conserved quantity , but unlike to the case , it is given as a homogeneous expression of degree five in @xmath65 and @xmath25 as @xmath69 figure  [ contour - y0-y1](a ) gives the contour plot with arrows to show the trajectories of the rg flows .",
    "then , we see that the line @xmath70 is the separatrix between the critical and the disordered phases , so the small parameter for the phase transition can be introduced as @xmath71 , with @xmath72 .",
    "now , with the aid of the conservation law , we can analyze the rg flows and obtain the following form : @xmath73 where the superscript `` @xmath74 '' indicates the sign of @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a certain function of @xmath77 given by the initial values of the couplings @xcite .",
    "this form exhibits a kind of self - similarity that the trajectories with the initial conditions having the same values of @xmath77 [ e.g. , all points on the red dotted line in fig .",
    "[ contour - y0-y1](a ) ] fall into a single curve independently of @xmath75 [ the red dotted line ( a numerical integration ) in fig .",
    "[ contour - y0-y1](b ) or [ contour - y0-y1](c ) ] , and that the @xmath77 dependence can be absorbed by changing the origin of the scaled variable according to @xmath76 ( the red dotted line overlaps with the pink short - dashed line ) .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath78 are complicated while those in the bkt transition are the trigonometric or the hyperbolic functions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can extract some properties because they share the basic feature with the bkt transition case . on the separatrix @xmath79 , the solution is simply given by @xmath80 with @xmath81 . around it , we find @xmath82(3/5)^{2/3}\\delta / y^{2/3}(l)$ ] when @xmath83 is satisfied ( the upper sign refers to the former ) .",
    "note that these expressions exhibit the nonsingularities of @xmath84 at @xmath85 and also that they can be regarded as the expansions of the following scaling forms : @xmath86    \\label{eq_form_1 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath87 . to cast these into the forms compatible with eq .",
    "( [ eq_form_pm ] ) , we should further replace @xmath88 by a temperature dependent parameter @xmath89 .",
    "however , since @xmath90 means the logarithmic scale to obtain the initial values @xmath91 from @xmath92 lying almost on the separatrix , it is a smooth function and can be represented by its value at the transition point , @xmath88 , near @xmath93 .",
    "now , we shall estimate the correlation length from eqs .",
    "( [ eq_form_pm ] ) and ( [ eq_form_1 ] ) .",
    "when we write the characteristic logarithmic scale as @xmath94 satisfying the condition @xmath95 , then @xmath96 .",
    "figure  [ contour - y0-y1](b ) exhibits @xmath97 , and @xmath75 is proportional to @xmath98 near @xmath93 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath99 $ ] with the exponent @xmath0 . unlike to the bkt transition case @xmath100 @xcite ,",
    "our theory predicts the above exponent , which is attributed to the nature of the topological defects characterized by the vector charges , and more precisely to the nonvanishing ope coefficient @xmath60 .",
    "however , our result also disagrees with the previous one based on the vector cg representation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the numerical evidence to support our theory is desired .    in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we shall provide the evidence by the use of the monte carlo ( mc ) method .",
    "for this purpose , here we explain the fss property of the helicity modulus to focus on below .",
    "the helicity modulus is defined as the response of the free energy against the long - wave - length ( @xmath101 ) twist of the local order field , which is proportional to the square of the wave number @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 @xcite . for the present model with the u(1)@xmath20u(1 ) symmetry ,",
    "the twist can be imposed by , for instance , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) is the position vector of the @xmath108th ( @xmath109th ) site and @xmath110 is a unit vector in the @xmath111 direction of the basal 2d space .",
    "then , one finds the following expression : @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is the 2d volume of the system . while this is useful for numerical estimations of @xmath116 , its theoretical expression is also obtained as follows . according to ref .",
    "[ ] , the above twist corresponds to the following shift in the vector field : @xmath117 , which then brings about the increase of the gaussian part in the free energy density @xmath118 . for @xmath119",
    ", we can renormalize the effects of the topological defects , so that the helicity modulus in the full theory is given by @xmath120 . as usual",
    ", the ratio @xmath121 exhibits the universal jump from 1 to 0 at @xmath122 in the thermodynamic limit although it is rounded off in the finite - size systems . relating to this",
    ", harada and kawashima performed the mc simulations of the 2d quantum xy model , and gave the fss analysis of the helicity modulus to confirm the bkt theory being valid there @xcite . according to their discussion , here we propose the fss form for the present phase transition : for the finite - size systems with the linear dimension @xmath123 near @xmath93 , @xmath124 and @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_form_1 ] ) are replaced by the logarithmic scale @xmath125 ( @xmath126 could depend on the temperature ) and @xmath98 , respectively . then , we obtain @xmath127^{\\frac53}\\}}{\\ln({l}/{l_0 } ) } ,   \\label{eq_fss }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 and @xmath126 are the parameters to be determined based on the fss ansatz .",
    "here , we shall provide the mc data of the helicity modulus and its fss analysis ( the details of our simulations will be given elsewhere ) . using the standard metropolis algorithm ,",
    "the systems of sizes up to @xmath128 were treated . the @xmath129 mc steps ( mcs )",
    "were used for samplings after the @xmath130 mcs for equilibration . at each temperature",
    ", we performed the independent runs up to 64 so as to attain reliable statistics of data . in units of the squared lattice constant @xmath131 ,",
    "the volume is given as @xmath132 , where @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) is the geometric factor of @xmath6 .",
    "then , we obtain the helicity modulus given in fig .",
    "[ helicitymodulus ] .",
    "as expected , it exhibits the steep decrease and crosses the straight line @xmath135 ( see the circles for @xmath128 ) .",
    "since @xmath116 stands for the stiffness of the interface , its reduction to 0 indicates a kind of melting .",
    "the inset gives the magnified view near the transition temperature , where @xmath136 is plotted against @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the crossings with the dotted line provide the finite - size estimates of @xmath93 , @xmath137 . in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] , we show the fss plot of @xmath116 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_fss ] ) , the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath126 were searched until the best collapsing of the scaled data is achieved . actually , we performed it by eye and obtained the values , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "then , the figure exhibits that the scaling region is narrow in the upper side of @xmath93 : for @xmath140 , it continues up to about 0.25 in the abscissa ( see the diamonds and circles ) .",
    "although this is due to the limitation on the size treated , and further to the property of @xmath116 showing the jump in the thermodynamic limit , we can check the reliability of our fss analysis as follows . as in the case of the bkt transition",
    ", we can extrapolate the finite - size estimates as @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the least - squares - fitting parameters .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath144 , which agrees well with the fss result .",
    "further , as argued , the scaling function is theoretically expected to satisfy @xmath145 .",
    "we denote this condition by the cross in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] and then we find the good coincidence with the fss analysis . with respect to the possibility of @xmath146 , we tried the fss analysis with its value , for instance , 2/5 , but the goodness of the scaling in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] could not be reproduced within our search .",
    "consequently , these numerical data and the consistencies among them strongly support our field theoretical description on the bkt - type phase transition observed in tsim @xcite .",
    "we shall mention the relevance of our theory to other systems .",
    "the bilinear - biquadratic spin-1 chain is exactly solvable in some cases .",
    "the uimin - lai - sutherland ( uls ) point is one of them , on which the low - energy excitations are described by the level-1 su(3 ) wess - zumino - witten model ( @xmath14 ) , and by which the massless quadrupole and the massive haldane phases are separated @xcite .",
    "this ground - state phase transition was clarified to be bkt - type , and in terms of the small parameter to control the distance from the uls point , the correlation length is given in the identical form as the present one ( i.e. , @xmath147 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , we think that the phase transition discussed here may share the same fixed - point properties with it ; we shall discuss this issue more closely in our future study @xcite .",
    "to summarize , based on the vector sine - gordon field theory , we have discussed the continuous phase transition observed in tsim ; the fss ansatz for the helicity modulus was proposed based on the rg analysis .",
