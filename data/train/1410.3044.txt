    "boundary integral equations are widely used in approximate solution of partial differential equations .",
    "for example , consider the dirichlet problem for the laplace equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a simply connected domain of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that the solution of the problem can be reduced to the solution of a double layer potential equation .    on the contour",
    "@xmath3 consider the double layer potential equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 refers to the outer normal to @xmath3 at the point @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a compact operator in the corresponding space .",
    "note that concrete form of @xmath7 depends on the boundary value problem considered .",
    "in particular , @xmath8 if one uses the following representation latexmath:[\\[u(z ) : = \\frac{1}{\\pi } { \\int_\\gamma}x(\\tau ) \\frac{d}{d n_{\\tau } } \\log |z-\\tau    value problem to the integral equation @xcite .",
    "the operator has been intensively studied and there is a vast literature concerning the properties of these operators considered on various contours and in various functional spaces @xcite . in particular , it is known that if @xmath3 is a smooth curve , then the double layer potential operator @xmath10 of is invertible , then the corresponding approximation method is stable provided that there is a `` good '' convergence of the approximation operators to the operator @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath3 possesses corner points , the operator is not compact anymore .",
    "therefore , now stability depends not only on the invertibility of the operator @xmath11 of and on convergence properties but also on additional parameters connected with the method itself and with the opening angles of the corner points .",
    "these features of approximation methods for equation considered on piecewise smooth contours has been mentioned in a number of works @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider the nystrm method based on gauss - legendre quadrature formulas .",
    "various modifications of this method have been discussed in literature .",
    "it turns out that these methods demonstrate a good convergence even in situation where @xmath3 possesses a large sets of corner points @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a rigorous analysis of the applicability of such methods is absent and one of the aims of this work is to provide necessary and sufficient conditions of the stability and to propose a method for their verification .",
    "it turns out that stability depends on the invertibility of certain operators which depend on the operator @xmath11 , on the parameters of the method , and on the opening angles of the corner points of @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we found four angles in the interval @xmath12 .",
    "these angles are called critical and if the boundary @xmath3 possesses such corner points , the method is not stable .",
    "note that similar problems for the sherman - lauricella and muskhelishvili equations have been studied in @xcite .",
    "let us make a few technical remarks .",

    "section [ s2 ] is devoted to fredholm properties of the operator @xmath11 .",
    "the results of this section are well known and are presented here in order to make the paper self contained and to introduce operators and functions which arise in the study of approximation operators .",
    "sections [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] deals with the nystrm method for the equation .",
    "more precisely , we study the stability of the nystrm method based on composite gauss - legendre quadrature rule @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are weights and gauss - legendre points on the interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "it s shown that the method under consideration is stable if and only if certain operators @xmath34 acting in the spaces of sequences of complex numbers are invertible .",
    "it can be shown that the operators arising belong to an algebra of toeplitz operators with matrix symbols . however ,",
    "at present there are no efficient criteria to verify whether operators from that algebra are invertible or not .",
    "therefore , we propose a numerical approach which allows us to detect critical angles of the nystrm method .",
    "our computations are restricted to the opening angles from the @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the remaining opening angles can be also considered but working with small angles and angles close to @xmath36 requires much more effort and computational cost is high .",
    "it is well - known that the invertibility of the operator @xmath11 is a necessary condition for the applicability of many numerical methods .",
    "it depends on the curve @xmath3 , on the compact operator @xmath7 and on the space where the operator @xmath11 acts . in this section",
    "we present certain conditions of the fredholmness of the operator @xmath11 considered in the space @xmath37 , @xmath38 in the case of piecewise smooth curves @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath3 be a simple piecewise smooth positively oriented contour in the complex plane and let @xmath39 be a @xmath40-periodic parametrization of @xmath3 .",
    "by @xmath41 we denote the set of all corner points @xmath42 of @xmath3 and assume that @xmath43 the function @xmath44 is two times continuously differentiable on each subinterval + @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and let @xmath47 be the angle between the right semi - tangent and the real axis @xmath48 .",
    "consider also the contour @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the positive semi - axes directed to and away from the origin , respectively .",
    "with each corner point @xmath52 we associate an operator @xmath53 defined by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the double layer potential operator on @xmath56 .",
    "application of theorem 1.9.5 of @xcite to the operator @xmath11 of leads to the following result    [ 521 ] let @xmath3 be a simple closed piecewise smooth curve in the complex plane @xmath15 . then the operator @xmath11 is fredholm if and only if all the operators @xmath57 are invertible for all @xmath58 .",

    "thus , the symbol of @xmath85 does not vanish on the line @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath85 is invertible for any @xmath102 and so are the operators @xmath57",
    ". now one can apply proposition [ 521 ] and obtain fredholmness of the operator @xmath11 .",
    "from now on we consider our operators as acting on the space @xmath103 without weight , i.e. we set @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , according to corollary [ cor2 ] , the operator @xmath11 of is fredholm .",
    "choose an @xmath105 and assume that @xmath106 is a non - negative integer such that @xmath107 .",

    "it is possible that they arose as the result of irreversibility of the corresponding operator @xmath11 on the curve @xmath292 .",
    "however , numerical experiments with other approximation methods for the same operators , which are not reported here , show that those methods have distinct critical angles .",
    "but it is not possible if the operator in question is irreversible for the angles mentioned .",
    "thus the values found represent the `` critical '' angles of the method but not the curves where the initial operator @xmath11 is not invertible .",
    "note that the numerical experiments are performed in matlab environment ( version 7.9.0 ) and executed on an acer veriton m680 workstation equipped with a intel core i7 vpro 870 processor and 8 gb of ram .",
    "in this work , necessary and sufficient conditions of the stability of the nystrm method for double layer potential equations on simple piecewise smooth contours are established .",
    "moreover , we found four angles in the interval @xmath293 whose presence on the contour @xmath3 will cause the instability of the method , does not matter what the shape the curve @xmath3 has .",
    "thus if the contour @xmath3 possesses at least one of such angles , the nystrm method is not stable and in order to find an approximate solution of the corresponding double layer potential equation , one has to use a different approximation method .",
