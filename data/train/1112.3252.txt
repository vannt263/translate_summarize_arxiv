    "a memory capable of storing quantum information is particularly challenging since a quantum state must be protected against both bit - flip and phase - flip errors .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to classical bits , quantum states form a continuous set thus being more vulnerable to small hardware imperfections .",
    "ground states of topologically ordered many - body systems , such as fractional quantum hall liquids  @xcite and unpaired majorana fermions in nanowires and 2d heterostructures  @xcite were proposed as a natural quantum data repository insensitive to local imperfections .",
    "a qubit encoded into the ground subspace of a topologically ordered system is almost perfectly decoupled from any local perturbation due to local indistinguishability of the ground states  @xcite .    to undo the effect of noise",
    ", a user of any memory , either classical or quantum , must invoke some form of error correction .",
    "it was shown by dennis et al  @xcite that topological memory based on the kitaev s 2d toric code model  @xcite can tolerate stochastic local noise provided that error correction is performed frequently enough to prevent errors from accumulating . however , such active error correction would require an extensive and fast classical input / output to the quantum hardware which might pose a challenge for building large - scale memory devices .",
    "an intriguing open question raised in  @xcite is whether topological memories can be _ self - correcting _ , that is , whether active error correction can be imitated by the natural dynamics of the memory system coupled to a thermal bath .",
    "the physical mechanism behind self - correction envisioned in  @xcite relies on a presence of  energy barriers \" separating distinct ground states and energy dissipation .",
    "if the energy barriers are high enough and the evolution time is not too long , the memory system will be locked in the  energy valley \" surrounding the initial ground state .",
    "a user of a self - correcting memory would only be responsible for preparation of the initial ground state and performing one final round of active error correction at the readout step .",
    "the latter is required to clean up the residual low - energy errors .",
    "in contrast to the active error correction approach of  @xcite , the storage itself would require no action from the user whatsoever .",
    "the nature of excitations in a topological memory plays a crucial role in assessing its self - correcting capability .",
    "anyons in the 2d toric code  @xcite provide a paradigmatic example of such excitations .",
    "a fundamental flaw of 2d topological memories that rules out self - correction is the lack of energy barriers that could suppress diffusion of anyons over large distances  @xcite .",
    "for instance , consider a process that involves a creation of anyon pair from the ground state , a transport of one anyon along a non - contractible loop on the torus , and a final annihilation of the pair .",
    "this process enacts a non - trivial transformation on the ground subspace .",
    "however , it can be implemented by a stream of local errors at a constant energy cost .",
    "the lack of self - correction for the 2d toric code model was rigorously confirmed by alicki et al  @xcite who showed that the relaxation time towards the equilibrium state is a constant independent of the lattice size .",
    "a more general no - go result for quantum self - correction based on arbitrary 2d stabilizer code hamiltonians was derived in  @xcite .    while anyons have a rich algebraic structure that depends on a particular model",
    ", their common property is that anyons are _",
    "topological defects_. more broadly , a topological defect is a point - like excitation that can not be created from the ground state by a local operator without creating other excitations .",
    "a domain wall in the 1d ferromagnetic ising chain provides the simplest example of a topological defect .",
    "the second property that applies to all models with anyonic excitations is that anyons are _ mobile _ topological defects . in other words ,",
    "once an anyon has been created at some spatial location , a local operator can move it to another location nearby without creating any other excitations . as we argued above",
    ", the latter property is the key reason why self - correction is hard , if not impossible , to achieve in 2d .",
    "it raises a question whether the laws of physics permit topological phases of matter without mobile topological defects  ?",
    "( in the coding language it translates to existence of topological codes without string - like logical operators . )",
    "quite surprisingly , the answer turns out to be yes .",
    "a family of 3d topological memory models without mobile topological defects was recently discovered by one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "one of these models , which we call the 3d cubic code , obeys the so called no - strings rule  @xcite .",
    "it establishes a constant upper bound @xmath6 on the mobility range of topological defects .",
    "more precisely , given any isolated topological defect occupying a spatial region of size @xmath7 , no local operator can move this defect distance @xmath8 or more away without creating extra excitations , see  @xcite for details .",
    "a strong evidence in favor of self - correcting properties of the 3d cubic code has been recently obtained in  @xcite by proving that the energy barrier separating distinct ground states grows as a logarithm of the lattice size .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to assess self - correcting properties of the 3d cubic code in a more direct way by calculating its memory time as a function of the lattice size and the temperature . for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we shall state our results only for the 3d cubic code , but our analysis applies to any quantum memory model based on a stabilizer code with local generators which obeys the topological order condition and the no - strings rule as stated in  @xcite .",

    "our numerical estimate of the error threshold is @xmath107 which is reasonably close to the threshold @xmath108 obtained using the minimum weight matching decoding  @xcite .",
    "perhaps more importantly , we prove that the rg decoder has a constant error threshold against local stochastic errors for _ any _ topological stabilizer code , see theorem  [ thm : universal - threshold ] in appendix  [ sec : threshold ] . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the rg decoder is the first error correction algorithm applicable to any topological stabilizer code that combines good practical performance with a rigorous lower bound on the error threshold and polynomial worst - case running time .",
    "* theorem  [ thm : main1 ] : sketch of the proof *    in section  [ sec : thermal ] we prove some basic facts about  thermal errors \" generated by the dissipative lindblad dynamics .",
    "we define an energy barrier @xmath109 of a pauli operator @xmath110 as the smallest integer @xmath111 such that @xmath110 can be implemented by a stream of single - qubit errors that does not create more than @xmath111 excitations during the process , see section  [ subs : energybarrier ] .",
    "the detailed balance condition and locality of quantum jump operators in the lindblad equation imply that thermal errors are unlikely to have a high energy barrier .",

    "we must invoke the special properties of the 3d cubic code .",
    "our key technical ingredient is theorem  2 of ref .",

    "a different , very promising , line of research initiated by pastawski et al  @xcite focuses on quantum memories in which active error correction is imitated by engineered dissipation driving the memory system towards the ground state ( as opposed to the gibbs state ) .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that quantum self - correction is technically different from the thermal stability of topological phases , see for instance  @xcite . while the latter attempts to establish the presence ( or absence ) of topological order in the equilibrium thermal state , quantum self - correction is mostly concerned with the relaxation time towards the equilibrium state .",
