    "recently , the modelling of diffusion - controlled reactions on lattices has attracted renewed interest due to synergies with some research areas like e.g.  heterogeneous catalysis @xcite , trapping problems @xcite , spin models @xcite , game theory @xcite , population dynamics @xcite or biological problems @xcite .",
    "an issue common to these systems is the important role played by the coexistence of different intrinsic time scales , the lattice characteristics ( size and dimensionality ) and many - body effects .",
    "the interplay of these ingredients may strongly affect the efficiency with which statistical processes such as front propagation on catalytic substrates , the spread of an infection , kink propagation in magnetic systems , or exciton trapping in photosynthetic cells take place . in order to obtain analytical insight for such systems , it is often necessary to make simplifying assumptions which nevertheless preserve their main generic features .    in this spirit ,",
    "a prototypical diffusion - reaction system consists of two interacting walkers performing nearest neighbor jumps on a lattice @xcite .",
    "the walkers are assumed to react with each other whenever they meet at the same lattice site or attempt to exchange positions .",
    "each of such `` encounters '' results in instantaneous reaction , the process therefore being diffusion - controlled .",
    "regardless of the particular outcome of the reaction , a measure for its efficiency will be clearly given by the mean encounter time of both walkers .",
    "in a pioneering work , montroll investigated a simplified version of the problem in which one of the walkers is stationary , thereby playing the role of a fixed trap @xcite .",
    "in a recent article @xcite , montroll s results have been extended with the help of a markovian method to account for the possibility of simultaneous displacement of the walkers . in the present work",
    ", the problem is further extended to the case in which the motion of the walkers consists of a random sequence of two different events : at each tick of the clock , a synchronous event takes place with probability @xmath1 , i.e. , both walkers hop simultaneously to randomly chosen nearest neighbor sites .",
    "alternatively , an asynchronous event takes place with probability @xmath6 , i.e. one of the walkers performs a nearest neighbor jump while the other remains immobile .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath1 interpolates between the one walker plus trap case studied by montroll ( @xmath7 ) and the case of two simultaneously moving walkers ( @xmath3 ) . a central question we shall investigate here",
    "concerns the influence of the degree of synchronicity @xmath1 of the walkers and the size @xmath2 of the lattice in which they are embedded upon the reaction s efficiency .",
    "our model may be of interest in several contexts .",
    "one can e.g. easily accomodate it to allow for events in which both walkers remain immobile in the original reference frame .",
    "thus , three qualitative different joint events become possible for the two - walker system , which can e.g. be interpreted as resulting from a combination of two internal states for each of the walkers , namely a diffusing and an immobile state .",
    "such two - state random walks @xcite are frequently used to model chromatographic @xcite or electrophoretic separation processes , in which the propagation of charged particles in an external field may be occasionally stopped by entanglement with the molecules of the substrate . such systems , along with hopping models for transport and recombination of carriers in solids @xcite , might provide additional motivation for considering a generalized version of the random walk .",
    "a different approach suggests to regard the fluctuations in the diffusivity of the walkers as a result of random fluctuations of lattice sites switching between a conducting and a stopping state , whereby the translational invariance of the lattice is preserved on average .",
    "an alternative formulation of the problem in terms of fluctuating dichotomous barriers between sites also seems possible @xcite .",
    "such models for dynamic random media are relevant for the description of several physiochemical processes like e.g. ligand diffusion in proteins @xcite or proton migration in water @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one goes back to the original picture of two dissimilar walkers @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the model may be regarded as a schematized starting point for describing the dynamics of exciton absorption in biological light - harvesting systems @xcite . in photosynthetic cells ,",
    "a photon is absorbed by the pigment molecules ( e.g. chorophyll ) in the cell and may give rise to an excited energy state .",
    "the exciton hops by resonant energy transfer through a network or lattice of 200 - 500 pigment molecules ( antenna system ) and can be eventually trapped at a reaction center @xcite , which is usually considered to be immobile within the time scale for trapping ( a few hundred picoseconds ) .",
    "the exciton energy is then used to trigger a series of redox processes in the chain of chemical reactions leading to the production of sugars and carbohydrates .",
    "thus , one of the time - limiting steps for the production of oxygen is precisely the absorption of the exciton by the trapping center . if we allow for a certain mobility of the reaction center ( thereby generalizing montroll s approach for exciton trapping ) , we can identify the latter with a slowly hopping walker , say the @xmath8 walker , while the propagating exciton would play the role of the @xmath9 walker .",
    "as long as the hopping rate of the @xmath8 walker remains small , the situation may be identified with the almost purely asynchronous case ( small @xmath1 ) ; this is normally the case in _ in vivo _ light - harvesting systems .",
    "however , a modification of the physical properties of the antenna system so as to make exciton propagation slower might , at least in principle , lead to interesting antiresonance phenomena as observed in our model .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define the two - walker system in detail and show how it can be recast into an equivalent one - walker system with absorbing sites . in section 3 , we report analytic work on the @xmath0 case and identify the principal differences between the purely asynchronous ( @xmath7 ) , the purely synchronous case ( @xmath3 ) and the mixed case ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these results are also supported by monte carlo simulations . in section 4 ,",
    "similar results are found for the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 cases by means of simulations in section 5 , the results are compared with the predictions of the continuum approximation valid for large lattices .",
    "finally , section 6 summarizes the main conclusions and discusses possible extensions .",
    "the starting point is a 1d periodic lattice with @xmath2 sites and discrete time dynamics ( cf fig . [ felfig1]a ) .",
    "we place two walkers @xmath8 and @xmath9 on two distinct lattice sites and let them evolve at each time step as follows :    1 .   with probability @xmath1 ,",
    "both walkers hop simultaneously to randomly chosen nearest neighbor sites ( _ synchronous event _ ) .",
    "2 .   with probability @xmath6 ,",
    "one of the walkers ( no matter which one ) remains at rest while the other performs a jump to a nearest neighbor site ( _ asynchronous event _ ) .",
    "the walkers are assumed to be unbiased , i.e. , their jumps are symmetric .",
    "we additionally assume that their jump directions are completely uncorrelated .",
    "an encounter takes place when both walkers ` land ' on the same site or attempt to exchange positions .",
    "each encounter triggers instantaneously an irreversible reactive interaction , say the annihilation reaction @xmath11 .",
    "the encounter time can thus be regarded as the characteristic reaction time governing the diffusion - controlled two - particle annihilation .    in principle , the mean encounter time can be computed for a single initial configuration of the walkers ; in many practical situations , though , one has little knowledge about the initial conditions",
    ". we shall therefore give preference to a definition of the mean encounter time which contains an additional coarse graining over all possible initial configurations .",
    "in the sequel , we shall denote this quantity by @xmath12 .",
    "the smaller @xmath12 , the more efficient the reaction will be .",
    "note that , due to the translational invariance of the lattice , the physical distinguishability of the walkers is irrelevant for the computation of @xmath12 : in other words , it does not matter which of the walkers @xmath8 or @xmath9 hops more often , since @xmath12 depends only on the relative motion of both walkers , the latter being fully characterized by @xmath1 . therefore , we shall assume for simplicity and without loss of generality that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are physically identical walkers and drop the labels @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as has been done in fig .",
    "[ felfig1]a .    for @xmath7 , only reactions through simultaneous site occupancy are possible . as far as @xmath12 is concerned , this case is equivalent to the one treated by montroll @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath13 , reaction through position exchange becomes possible .",
    "this technical obstacle makes the analytical treatment of the problem more difficult .    a first step to circumvent",
    "this difficulty is to take advantage of the translational invariance of the lattice and reformulate the problem in terms of a single walker .",
    "to do so , we must switch over to a new comoving reference frame in which one of the walkers remains stationary , thereby playing the role of a fixed perfect trap @xmath14 ( fig . [ felfig1]b ) .",
    "clearly , an asynchronous event in the original two - walker system is equivalent to nearest neighbor hopping in the single - walker system , while a synchronous event results either in a walker s jump by two lattice sites ( if both walkers hop in opposite directions in the original reference frame ) or its remaining at rest ( if they hop in the same direction ) . in this picture",
    ", reaction takes place any time the walker reaches or overreaches the trap @xmath14 .",
    "we can now take advantage of the simple lattice geometry and the fact that the trap is perfect to unfold the @xmath2-site lattice into an equivalent one with @xmath15 sites and two perfect traps @xmath14 sitting at each end site , as shown in fig .",
    "[ felfig2 ] for @xmath16",
    ". this transformation does not of course affect the characteristics of the walk ; a walker jump in anticlockwise direction will be equivalent to a jump to the left by the same number of sites in the transformed lattice .",
    "next , we replace each trap @xmath14 by two ( fictitious ) reactive sites @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ felfig3 ] ) .",
    "the random walk will instantaneously terminate when the walker lands on any of these @xmath17-sites .",
    "we shall therefore occasionally call the @xmath17-sites `` absorbing '' in what follows .",
    "let us assign the coordinates @xmath18 to @xmath19 to each of the non - absorbing sites , as shown in fig .",
    "[ felfig3 ] .",
    "additionally , we term the @xmath17-sites at the left end @xmath20 and @xmath21 and those at the right end @xmath2 and @xmath15 .",
    "an attempt to overcome , say the left trap , triggered by a synchronous event will be equivalent to a jump from site @xmath18 to site @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , the walker s landing on the trap can be realized either by an asynchronous event ( jump from site @xmath18 to site @xmath21 ) or by a synchronous event ( jump from site @xmath22 to site @xmath21 ) . if the dynamics is purely asynchronous , only one @xmath17-site at each end will be needed , since jumps by two sites are not possible in this case .",
    "thus , events involving position exchange can be dealt with by going over to a one - walker picture and introducing fictitious absorbing sites .",
    "the mean duration of the walk averaged over the initial positions @xmath23 of the walker plays the role of @xmath12 in the original two - walker system .",
    "a standard approach for the calculation of @xmath24 is to formulate the problem for the restricted walk between the absorbing sites in terms of a conditional first passage problem for an unrestricted walk on an infinite @xmath0 lattice @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the markovian master equation @xmath25 + \\frac{1-p}{2 } \\left [ p_{n}(j-1 )   +   p_{n}(j+1 ) \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the probability to find the walker at a given site @xmath27 in the infinite lattice after @xmath28 time steps . the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ masteq ] ) is the contribution due to the synchronous events , by which the walker either remains at rest or it moves ( here ) two lattice sites either to the left or to the right .",
    "the second term describes jumps by one lattice site as a consequence of asynchronous events . the mean time to absorption @xmath12",
    "can now be viewed as a first - passage time and computed via a generating function approach @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath12 can be expressed in terms of the generating function for the probability of the walker arriving for the first time at a given @xmath17-site after a given number of steps without having been previously in neither of the other three @xmath17-sites .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting expressions for @xmath12 are not very transparent and their analytical dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath1 is not easy to determine .",
    "another possibility is to make use of the single step probabilities appearing as coefficients in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ masteq ] ) to compute the transition probabilities between the states of the underlying absorbing markov chain . in this approach",
    ", @xmath12 can be related to the row sums over the elements of the fundamental matrix for the transition to the absorbing state or , alternatively , to its smallest eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that it requires the inversion of increasingly large matrices as @xmath2 becomes large .",
    "finally , the method we shall further develop here exploits the analogy of our random walk problem with the classical ruin problem studied by feller @xcite .",
    "even though this approach has the disadvantage of being difficult to generalize to higher dimensions , it provides an elegant solution for the 1d problem .",
    "we first recall briefly the classical gambler s ruin problem . consider a single walker ( in our setting",
    ", this would correspond to the limit p=0 ) , whose position @xmath29 is viewed as the capital of a gambler playing against an adversary whose capital is @xmath30 . at each time step ,",
    "a trial is made , as a result of which the gambler wins or loses one euro .",
    "thus , the gambler s winning corresponds to a nearest neighbor jump of the walker to the right , while losing the trial corresponds to a jump to the left .",
    "the game goes on until the gambler s capital is reduced to zero or increases to @xmath2 ( absorption of the walker at sites @xmath21 or @xmath2 ) .",
    "one is interested in the mean duration of the game @xmath31 when the gambler starts with a given capital @xmath29 .",
    "this quantity can be shown to be finite as long as @xmath32 and obeys the following difference equation @xcite : @xmath33 with the boundary conditions @xmath34 eq . ( [ mtdiffeq ] )",
    "states that the walker has no memory of where it has been at earlier time steps ; if it is initially at site @xmath29 , it will either jump to site @xmath35 or to site @xmath36 with probability @xmath37 .",
    "once at any of these sites , the walker will continue his walk without remembering its previous position @xmath29 .",
    "it is as though the walker started a new walk from @xmath35 or @xmath36 with equal probability , except that the expected value of the mean time to absorption must be increased by one unit @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ bcdiffeq ] ) reflect the fact that , if the walker is initially placed at a @xmath17-site , it is immediately absorbed . in the original two - walker system , this is equivalent to placing both walkers at the same site .",
    "( [ mtdiffeq])-([bcdiffeq ] ) can be solved by standard methods , e.g. by writing the general solution as the sum of the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation plus a particular solution @xcite .",
    "one obtains in this way @xmath38 and @xmath39    the opposite limit of the above ( @xmath3 ) , corresponding in our setting to a purely synchronous motion of _ two _ walkers , is somewhat less standard . in this case , only jumps by zero or two lattice sites may occur .",
    "depending on its initial position , the walker may land on any of the four @xmath17-sites depicted in fig .",
    "[ felfig3 ] .",
    "therefore , two additional boundary conditions for the absorbing sites @xmath20 and @xmath15 are needed",
    ".    in the gambler s jargon , a jump by two sites means doubling the stake of each trial , i.e. , the player wins or loses two euros with probability 1/4 .",
    "besides , a tie occurs with probability 1/2 ( no jump ) .",
    "the game terminates when either the player or his adversary reaches or overreaches a capital of @xmath2 euros .",
    "now , the difference equation for the duration of the game is a fourth - order one : @xmath40 the solution of this equation requires four boundary conditions , namely @xmath41 a particular solution of ( [ syndiffeq ] ) is given by @xmath42 .",
    "the characteristic equation of the homogeneous equation has two double roots @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the full inhomogeneous solution reads @xmath44 substituting into eq .",
    "( [ syndiffeq ] ) one obtains a system of equations for @xmath45 to @xmath46 whose solution yields @xmath47 the spatially averaged time to absorption @xmath24 is again easily computed .",
    "one obtains @xmath48    for notational convenience , let us rename the value of @xmath12 obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ evenoddenct ] ) as @xmath49 , and the corresponding result of montroll for the one - walker problem ( eq .",
    "( [ montenct ] ) ) as @xmath50 . a comparison between @xmath51 and @xmath49 is shown in fig .",
    "[ felfig6 ] .",
    "as expected , the synchronous case becomes more efficient as soon as the lattice gets sufficiently large ( @xmath52 ) . in the limit of a very large lattice ,",
    "it is asymptotically twice as efficient as the asynchronous case [ see fig.[felfig7 ] ) ] .",
    "it is also worth comparing the @xmath29-distribution of the encounter time for the case @xmath3 ( eq . ( [ multinz ] ) ) , with the earlier known result for @xmath7 ( eq . ( [ enctspd ] ) ) . for odd @xmath2 ,",
    "the spatial profile in @xmath29 displays some qualitative similarities in both cases ( cf . figs .",
    "[ felfig4]a and [ felfig4]b ) .",
    "the highest value of @xmath53 is attained at those sites @xmath29 that maximize the distance @xmath54 from the closest absorbing site . for @xmath7",
    ", the encounter time always increases with increasing @xmath55 , and it becomes maximum when @xmath56 .",
    "in contrast , the behavior is no longer strictly monotonic for @xmath3 , since @xmath31 either increases _ or _ remains constant as @xmath55 becomes larger , giving rise to a `` staircase '' profile for high enough values of @xmath2 ( fig . [ felfig4]b ) .    for even lattices , there are more marked differences between the cases @xmath7 and @xmath3 . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the discrete spatial profile resembles an inverted parabola like in the odd lattice case , the maximum now being located at @xmath57 .",
    "however , if @xmath3 , one observes a series of alternating valleys and peaks in the distribution ( cf figs .",
    "[ felfig5]a and [ felfig5]b ) .",
    "there are two subcases here : if @xmath2 is divisible by @xmath58 , the highest values of @xmath59 are attained for @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ felfig5]a ) .",
    "otherwise , the maximum value corresponds again to @xmath57 ( fig . [ felfig5]b ) .",
    "note that for @xmath7 and even @xmath2 the time to absorption when the walker is started at sites @xmath18 or @xmath19 is smaller than in the purely synchronous case .",
    "an intuitive argument points to the fact that , in the former case , the walker is absorbed one out of two times after the first time step , while absorption takes place only one out of four times if @xmath3 .",
    "however , this argument should be taken with care , since it fails for odd @xmath2 .",
    "besides , as we shall see later on , the minimum of @xmath61 corresponds to a process with @xmath13 .",
    "we finally turn to the general case of a mixed walk .",
    "assume that a given event is synchronous with probability @xmath10 and asynchronous with probability @xmath6 .",
    "the difference equation for @xmath31 now reads :    @xmath62    the boundary conditions are again given by ( [ synbcdiffeq ] ) . a particular solution of eq .",

    "@xmath72 does not depend on @xmath1 . at each individual time step ,",
    "the probability of reaction is always @xmath37 , regardless of whether both walkers hop or only one of them . in a sense , the cases @xmath71 and @xmath73 are non - generic , since they only involve a single symmetry - distinct initial condition . for @xmath69 , a new parity effect",
    "appears : if @xmath2 is even , the most effective process is observed for an intermediate value of @xmath1 associated to a minimum of the function @xmath12 in the physically acceptable @xmath1-interval @xmath74 $ ] ; in contrast , for odd lattices , @xmath72 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath1 , i.e. , the most effective process is always the purely synchronous one . for @xmath75 , any intermediate value of @xmath1 makes hopping more effective than in both limiting cases , and a minimum of @xmath12 is obtained for @xmath76 . for higher ,",

    "[ felfig9]a and [ felfig9]b ) .",
    "however , the qualitative @xmath1-dependence of @xmath31 in the large @xmath1 limit becomes different for initial positions with even or odd values of @xmath55 : for even values of @xmath2 and initial positions with odd @xmath55 , @xmath59 begins to increase sharply , as a result of which a minimum of the curve is observed ( cf fig .",

    "the solution of ( [ eqdt ] ) which fulfils these boundary conditions is @xmath118 the spatially averaged reaction time @xmath119 is obtained by integrating over @xmath120 : @xmath121 as expected , @xmath119 is proportional to the squared lattice length and inversely proportional to the relative diffusion coefficient @xmath112 . for the special cases @xmath7 and @xmath3 , this result is recovered by directly taking the diffusive limit in the discrete solutions ( [ montenct ] ) and ( [ evenoddenct ] ) . the relation ( [ ratioenct ] )",
    "leads to the asymptotic law @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath12 is given by eq .",
    "( [ enctgen ] ) .",
    "( [ aslaw ] ) shows that in the continuum limit , the efficiency of the reaction increases linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "the continuum approximation applies for sufficiently large @xmath2 , namely when the typical displacement of the walker @xmath124 at each time step is small compared to the lattice length @xmath125 .",
    "if this condition is not fulfilled , the approximation gets significantly worse at large values of @xmath1 ( cf fig .",
    "[ felfig10 ] ) .    a generalization of ( [ eqdt ] ) for higher order moments @xmath126 can be obtained by writing down the difference equations for the discrete quantities @xmath127 and taking the diffusive limit thereof .",
    "one then gets the coupled set of equations @xmath128 eqs .",
    "( [ encthie ] ) , not to be further dealt with here , are well known from the theory of first - passage problems , where they are usually obtained from the adjoint fokker - planck equation for the underlying diffusion process @xcite .",
    "again , deviations from the dynamics dictated by ( [ encthie ] ) are expected for small lattices .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath0 problem of computing the mean reaction time between two diffusing co - reactants can be reduced to a trapping problem for a single walker .",
    "the latter can be viewed as a generalized ruin problem , the duration of the game plays thereby the role of the mean time to absorption .    in the diffusive limit ,",
    "equivalent to the limit @xmath129 if the lattice length @xmath98 is held fixed , the reaction efficiency increases linearly with @xmath1 , but important deviations are observed for not too large values of @xmath2 . beyond the crossover size @xmath75 , a new parity effect is observed . for odd values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the reaction time still increases monotonically ( but no longer linearly ) with @xmath1 , while for even values of @xmath2 , the efficiency is optimized for an intermediate value @xmath130 . in higher dimensions ,",
    "this parity effect is even more pronounced , i.e. for even lattices there is a drastic increase in efficiency when a tiny amount of synchronicity is introduced .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath0 case , the effect is enhanced with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "let us briefly comment on the @xmath0 results from the perspective of the ruin problem .",
    "assume that one of the gamblers is successively given an starting capital of @xmath131 euros at each round , while his adversary gets @xmath132 euros .",
    "let us further suppose that the gamblers can choose between two kinds of trials : the stake for the first one is one euro and there is no tie . in the second trial ,",
    "either nobody wins or one of the gamblers wins two euros . according to our results , for an odd capital @xmath2 , the gamblers minimize the average playing time if they always make a two - euro bet . however , if @xmath2 is even , they should make a small amount of one - euro bets in order to finish the round as soon as possible .",
    "our work can be extended in many different ways .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward one is the detailed characterization of the whole distribution @xmath133 in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "a generalization of results such as equation ( [ aslaw ] ) to higher dimensional integral and fractal lattices is also of interest , since it may further clarify the role of dimensionality and the lattice coordination number .",
    "according to our results , in one - dimension two synchronously moving walkers are asymptotically twice as efficient as when they hop one after the other . in a 2d square planar lattice ,",
    "kozak _ et al .",
    "_ have shown that the purely synchronous case is @xmath134 times more efficient than the purely asynchronous one in the large @xmath2 limit for odd lattices @xcite .",
    "the question is whether or not the relative efficiency of both processes in lattices with fractal dimension @xmath135 lies between @xmath22 and @xmath134 .",
    "preliminary calculations on a sierpinski gasket ( with fractal dimension @xmath136 ) seem to indicate an asymptotic relative efficiency higher than @xmath22 in this case , despite the fact that the lattice has ( up to the three vertex sites ) the same coordination number as a 2d square planar lattice @xcite .",
    "the reason for this may be the important role played by the specific form of the lattice boundaries , even in the limit of a large lattice .",
    "this may motivate the study of boundary conditions other than periodic ones for the two - walker system .",
    "however , the analytical treatment of this case is considerably harder , at least in the framework of the method of difference equations , since the lattice is no longer translationally invariant .",
