    "the goal of this paper is to present and discuss a non - instant field model of charged particles that has stronger causality properties than the classical model and can be quantized .",
    "a highlight of this paper is the causal explanation of the _ aharonov - bohm effect_. it is best to start with a shortly review of electrodynamics and discuss the differences and relations to our model without carrying out the details .",
    "the electromagnetic field concept in classical field theory is an instant one and in this sense causality is violated .",
    "for example , the four potential @xmath7 of a charged particle in its restframe @xmath8 is modeled by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath9 where a prime indicates a quantity observed in the restframe @xmath8 of the charge .",
    "the charge @xmath10 is an invariant and therefore is not primed .",
    "we see at once that the coulomb condition @xmath11 as well as the lorentz condition @xmath12 are satisfied . since the latter condition is covariant ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , it holds in all reference frames .",
    "in contrast to this model , a non - instant field model must have a time - dependent scalar potential @xmath13 and if @xmath14 is assumed , then the lorentz condition can not be satisfied . consequently , for the non - instant field model presented in this paper @xmath15 and the respective field theory depends not only on the electric and magnetic fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 but also on the _ invariant _ @xmath16 . as a consequence ,",
    "a _ lorentz gauge transformation _ of the non - instant four potential @xmath0 is prohibited . since",
    "gauge transformations are used all the time in physics ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , this statement seems to be absurd .",
    "but on the other hand , gauge theories might be considered as `` unsatisfactory '' ( cf .",
    "chapter iii.4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that this is not a problem , since our model satisfies the following _ correspondence principle_.    the respective classical quantities of electrodynamics can be obtained from the non - instant field model via a covariant time averaging operator @xmath6 . if @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the scalar potential , the electric field and the magnetic field of a charged particle in its restframe @xmath8 , then it follows @xmath20 = \\phi'_{cl}\\,,\\qquad    { \\mathcal{a}}[{{\\mathbf{e } } } ' ] = { { \\mathbf{e}}}'_{cl}\\,,\\qquad    { \\mathcal{a}}[{{\\mathbf{b } } } ' ] = { { \\mathbf{b}}}'_{cl } \\qquad\\mbox{and}\\qquad     \\partial_\\mu\\,{\\mathcal{a}}[a^\\mu ] = 0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the respective quantities from classical electrodynamics .",
    "the last condition means that the lorentz condition is satisfied for the time averaged non - instant four potential . here",
    "the quantity @xmath3 $ ] is interpreted as the best possible measurement of the four potential @xmath0 .",
    "because the time averaging interval @xmath24 is extremely small , it appears as if the measurement process was performed at a time instant ( in @xmath8 ) .    because the classical quantities @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] are time independent , it seems as if the electromagnetic field fills out the space instantaneously . on the one hand ,",
    "calculation with time averaged quantities is very convenient ( because we have gauge invariance and we got used to it ) , but on the other hand , the `` time averaged picture '' does not always allow to associate a cause to an effect .",
    "for example , the non - instant field model predicts that a solenoid sends out an electromagnetic wave of extreme high frequency @xmath27 such that the _ aharonov - bohm effect _",
    "@xcite ) does not violate causality .",
    "however , if we go over to the `` time averaged picture '' causality seems to be violated , since then @xmath28={{\\mathbf{0}}}\\qquad\\mbox{and}\\qquad   { { \\mathbf{b}}}_{cl } \\equiv { \\mathcal{a}}[{{\\mathbf{b}}}]={{\\mathbf{0}}}\\qquad \\mbox{outside the solenoid.}\\ ] ] the _ correspondence principle _ can be summarized as follows : @xmath29 for modeling the left side of this mapping there might be only one reason / justification , to find the causes of a measurable effects .",
    "although this paper is mainly concerned with classical field theory i would like to say a view words about quantum electrodynamics . since maxwell s equations of the non - instant four potential read as follows @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the four current and @xmath32 is the electromagnetic field tensor ( cf",

    "subsection 5.1 in  @xcite ) . that the lorentz condition is only satisfied for @xmath3 $ ] means that the lorentz condition is satisfied for the expectation value of the quantized four potential , which is ( and can be ) assumed in quantum electrodynamics .",

    "but this has to be expected of a non - instant field model .    as a consequence we have to ask : `` is there an energy problem for charged particles ? ''",
    "my point of view is that a charged particle is able to use the energy from its surrounding ( e.g. the microwave background radiation ) to maintain its field .",
    "besides , there is plenty of energy near our sun . in this way energy is spread over the universe and can be used by other particles .",
    "( this is very suggestive , is it not ? )",
    "geometric considerations imply that a macroscopic object can maintain its required energy content much longer than a single particle .",
    "the worst case is a single particle far away from energy suppliers .",

    "is it    * destroyed , or * does it use its rest mass ( or a part of it ) to maintain its field or * does it move without sending out an electromagnetic field ?",

    "we have presented a non - instant field model for classical field theory that can be quantized with the _ gupta - bleuler method_. the fact that the non - instant field model does not permit a lorentz gauge transformation is not an obstacle for quantization and does not contradict the essential results of _ classical field theory_. indeed , our model obeys a correspondence principle , i.e. the classical field quantities @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath162 can be obtained via a covariant time averaging operator @xmath6 from the respective quantities of the non - instant field model and the lorentz gauge transformation is satisfied for the time averaged four potential .",
    "although the calculation with the time averaged quantities is very convenient , it does not allow to associate a cause to each effect .",
    "as shown in this paper , the non - instant field model predicts that a solenoid sends out an electromagnetic wave of extreme high frequency such that @xmath4={{\\mathbf{0}}}$ ] and @xmath5={{\\mathbf{0}}}$ ] outside the solenoid , and consequently - according to our correspondence principle - a measurement of the magnetic field yields the value zero outside the solenoid . as a consequence ,",
    "the _ aharonov - bohm effect _ does not violate causality if the non - instant field model is used .",
    "however , if we go over to the `` time averaged picture '' ( @xmath219 classical electrodynamics ) , causality seems to be violated .",
    "as we have demonstrated , classical field theory describes the behavior of time averaged field quantities @xmath220,\\,{\\mathcal{a}}[y],\\,\\ldots$ ] rather than the non - instant field quantities @xmath221 themselves .",
    "if we grant the quantities @xmath221 physical significance by using a non - instant field theory , then we are able to describe the _ aharonov - bohm effect _ in a causal way and the quantization of the respective equations of maxwell is still possible .",

    "the role of the covariant time averaging operator @xmath6 is understood as a causal restriction on the measurement process .",
