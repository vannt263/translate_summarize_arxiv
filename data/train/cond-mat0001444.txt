    "non trivial collective behavior ( ntcb ) is an interesting feature peculiar to extensively chaotic dynamical systems , where the temporal evolution of spatially averaged quantities reveals the onset of long - range order in spite of the local disorder @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "a simple way to observe ntcb is to study models of spatially extended chaotic systems such as coupled map lattices ( cmls ) that consist of chaotic maps locally coupled diffusively with some coupling strength @xmath0 @xcite . in these systems",
    "one observes multistability that is the remainder , for small couplings , of the completely uncoupled case @xcite . for large enough couplings ntcb",
    "is observed , corresponding to a _",
    "macroscopic _ attractor , well - defined in the infinite - size limit and reached for almost every initial condition .    in a recent paper @xcite phase separation mechanisms",
    "have been investigated in a coupled map lattice model where the one - body probability distribution functions of local ( continuous ) variables has two disjoint supports . by introducing ising spin variables ,",
    "the phase ordering process following uncorrelated initial conditions was numerically studied and complete phase ordering was observed for large coupling values . both the persistence probability @xmath1 ( i.e. the proportion of spins that has not changed sign up to time @xmath2 ) and the characteristic length of domains @xmath3 ( evaluated as the width at midheigth of the two - point correlation function ) showed scaling behavior and the scaling exponents @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( defined by the scaling laws @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) were found to vary continuously with parameters , at odds with traditional models .",
    "the study of the phase ordering properties also allowed to determine the limit value @xmath8 beyond which multistability disappears and ntcb is observed @xcite . indeed the following relations were found to hold : @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and were used to determine @xmath8 .",
    "the ratio @xmath11 was found to be close to @xmath12 , the ratio known for the time dependent ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "subsequently dynamical scaling was studied in a lattice model of chaotic maps where the corresponding ising spin model conserves the order parameter @xcite .",
    "this model is equivalent to a conserved ising model with couplings that fluctuate over the same time scale as spin moves , in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath13 .",
    "the scaling exponents @xmath5 and @xmath4 were found to vary with temperature .",
    "in particular the growth exponent @xmath4 was observed to increase with temperature ; it follows that thermal noise speeds up the phase ordering process in this class of models . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath4 assumes the value @xmath14 , corresponding to the universality class of a langevin equation known as model @xmath15 @xcite , that describes the standard conserved ising model ( when bulk diffusion dominate over surface diffusion @xcite ) .",
    "the role of noise as an ordering agent has been broadly studied in recent years in the context of both temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics . in the temporal case , that was first considered ,",
    "external fluctuations were found to produce and control transitions ( known as _ noise - induced transitions _ ) from monostable to bistable stationary distributions in a large variety of physical , chemical and biological systems @xcite .",
    "as far as spatiotemporal systems are concerned , the combined effects of the spatial coupling and noise may produce an ergodicity breaking of a bistable state , leading to phase transitions between spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous phases .",
    "results obtained in this field include critical - point shifts in standard models of phase transitions @xcite , pure _ noise - induced phase transitions _",
    "@xcite , stabilization of propagating fronts @xcite , and noise - driven structures in pattern - formation processes @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the qualitative ( and somewhat counterintuitive ) effect of noise is to enlarge the domain of existence of the ordered phase in the parameter space .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to analyse the role of additive noise in the phase separation of multiphase coupled map lattices @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that external noise can induce complete phase ordering for coupling values not leading to phase separation in the absence of the noise term .",
    "furthermore this dynamical transition is reentrant : phase separation appears at a critical value of the noise intensity but disappears again at one higher value of the noise strength .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the coupled map lattice model here considered is introduced . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical results .",
    "section 4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a two - dimensional square lattice of coupled identical maps @xmath16 acting on real variables @xmath17 , whose evolution is governed by the difference equation : @xmath18+g\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } f[x_j(t ) ] + \\xi_i ( t ) .",
    "\\label{eq1}\\ ] ] here the sum is over the nearest neighbors of site @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a random number uniformly distributed in @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath0 is the coupling strength and periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "we have chosen the following map : @xmath22 & if\\;\\ ; x\\in[-\\infty,-{1\\over 3 } ]   \\\\   \\mu x & if\\;\\ ; x\\in [ -{1 \\over 3},{1 \\over 3 } ] \\\\   { \\mu\\over 3}\\exp { [ \\alpha({1\\over 3}-x ) } ] & if\\;\\ ;",
    "x\\in[{1\\over 3},+\\infty ]   \\end{array }   \\right .",
    "\\label{map}\\ ] ] that is defined for every @xmath23 in the real axis ( see fig .",
    "the map here considered is a modified version of the map used in @xcite ; the modification is motivated by the fact that , due to the term noise @xmath20 , variables @xmath24 are not constrained to take value in @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "choosing @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath16 has two simmetric chaotic attractors , one with @xmath28 and the other with @xmath29 . in fig .",
    "2 we show the invariant distribution of the attractor with positive @xmath30s : it is composed of smooth pieces . the lyapunov exponent of the map was evaluated @xmath31 .    to study the phase ordering process , uncorrelated initial conditions were generated as follows : one half of the sites were chosen at random and the corresponding values of @xmath23 were assigned according to the invariant distribution of the chaotic attractor with @xmath28 , while the other sites were similarly assigned values with @xmath29 .",
    "we associated an ising spin configuration @xmath32 $ ] with each configuration of the @xmath23 variable .",
    "large lattices ( up to @xmath33 ) with periodic boundary conditions were used ; the persistence @xmath1 was measured as the proportion of sites that has not changed @xmath34 the initial value .",
    "the average domain size @xmath3 was measured by the relation @xmath35=1/2 $ ] , where @xmath36 is the two point correlation function of the spin variables .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath3 were averaged over many ( up to thirty ) different samples of initial conditions .",
    "fixing @xmath37 , that is considering the noise - free case , we performed the analysis suggested in @xcite . for various values of @xmath0",
    "we measured the characteristic length @xmath38 and the persistence @xmath39 as functions of time ; both these quantities saturate for small couplings and show scaling behaviour for large @xmath0 values .",
    "the associated exponents , respectively @xmath4 and @xmath5 , were continuous functions of @xmath0 well described by the fitting ansatz @xcite : @xmath40 the estimated values of @xmath8 and @xmath41 were @xmath42 and @xmath43 while fitting the exponent @xmath4 , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 for the exponent @xmath5 .",
    "the ratio @xmath11 was approximately independent of @xmath0 and equal to @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , we observed that the same fitting ansatz can be used to fit our data for nonvanishing and small noise strength @xmath47 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) we show respectively the fit of @xmath4 and @xmath5 versus @xmath0 , while keeping @xmath48 fixed and equal to @xmath49 .",
    "as one can see , data are well fitted by the scaling forms ( [ eqfit ] ) , and the estimated values are @xmath50 , @xmath51 for the @xmath4 exponent , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 for the @xmath5 exponent @xcite . the ratio @xmath11 was estimated at @xmath54 .",
    "we remark that our estimate of the critical coupling @xmath8 , when non - vanishing and small noise is present , is smaller than the noise - free critical value .",
    "this fact clearly shows that a proper amount of noise favours the phase separation process of the system .",
    "let us now consider the region @xmath55 . here in the noise - free case the system evolves towards blocked configurations and no phase separation takes place .",
    "we checked , however , that this asymptotic regime was attained after very long evolution times : the system spended a lot of time in metastable states , so that the evolution curve for @xmath38 and @xmath39 displayed typical stairs structure .",
    "this structure ( the times marking the steps of the curve ) was very robust , in the sense that :    * it resisted to a change of the initial conditions ( choosen following the particular prescription of section ii ) , * it did not depend on lattice dimension , * a little noise ( low @xmath47 ) did not destroy it .    nevertheless , when growing the amount of noise , the life time of these metastable states became shorter and shorter , till they definitely disappeared for @xmath47 greater than a critical value @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath57 we got again power laws for @xmath3 and @xmath1 , showing that the system separates for large times .",
    "this behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "we estimated the critical value @xmath58 by fitting our data with the ansatz @xmath59 . in fig .",
    "5 we show our data corresponding to @xmath60 : we evaluated @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "as in the case of the choice [ eqfit ] , we have no theoretical argument to support the choice of the fitting ansantz , but the fact that it works on a large interval of @xmath0 letting us to give a precise measurement of @xmath58 .",
    "we were able to measure in such a way @xmath58 for @xmath0 greater than @xmath63 ; at smaller values of @xmath0 the dynamics became very slow and we were not able to numerically extract the exponent @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath47 was increased , we found a transition at another critical value of the noise strength showing that the system does not separate beyond this critical @xmath47 .",
    "as an example in fig .",
    "6 we show the exponent @xmath4 versus @xmath47 for @xmath0 fixed and equal to @xmath64 .",
    "the transition seems to be discontinuous .",
    "we repeated this analysis for several values of @xmath0 . interpolating the above described data for the critical noise strength",
    ", we built the phase diagram for the model shown in fig .",
    "the system separates in the shaded area , that is it tends asymptotically to complete phase ordering .",
    "points in the white area correspond to an asymptotic regime of the system where clusters of the two phases are dynamical but their mean size remains constant ; only for @xmath37 one has blocked configurations with clusters fixed in time .",
    "our data concern @xmath0 greater than 0.025 , however we extrapolated the two critical curves towards @xmath65 .",
    "we observe , interestingly , that the extrapolation of the two curves seem to meet at @xmath65 ; further investigation is needed to clarify the behavior of the noisy system close to @xmath65 .",
    "the phase ordering properties of multiphase chaotic map lattices have recently attracted interest since they differ from those of traditional models . in this paper",
    "we have shown that additive noise acts as an ordering agent in this class of systems , i.e. for a suitable amount of noise the system may order even for values of the coupling strength for which no separation is observed in the absence of the noise - term .",
    "a simple explanation for this behavior is as follows .",
    "small values of the spatial coupling lead , in the noise - free case , to spatially blocked configurations where interfaces between clusters of each phase are strictly pinned . a proper amount of noise makes the system cross these barriers thus leading to complete ordering .",
    "we have numerically constructed a phase diagram describing this behavior . as we said ,",
    "a similar effect was observed in chaotic map lattices evolving with conserved dynamics , where we found that the growth exponent increases with temperature @xcite ; in the present case the additive noise plays the role of the thermal noise .",
