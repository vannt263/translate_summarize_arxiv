    "the aim of this article is to study the convergence properties of the probability measures @xmath4 in terms of their densities @xmath6 .",
    "convergence of the densities of a sequence of distributions to the density of the limit distribution ( assuming the given densities exist ) is the object of classical local limit theorems @xcite .",
    "one such limit theorem concerning the sequence @xmath7 was discovered by bercovici and voiculescu in @xcite , where the random variable @xmath3 is assumed to be _ bounded _",
    "( i.e. , the law of @xmath3 has a bounded support ) .",
    "the limit law in this case is the standard semicircular distribution @xmath8 whose density is @xmath9 on the interval @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "this convergence to the semicircle law , referred as the _ superconvergence _ in @xcite , is very strong in the sense that the measures @xmath4 become lebesgue absolutely continuous after finitely many @xmath11 s , the density of @xmath4 is supported on an interval @xmath12 $ ] and analytic on @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the sequence @xmath6 converges uniformly to @xmath16 as @xmath17 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the weak convergence of the sequence @xmath7 to the measure @xmath8 , also known as the _ free central limit theorem _ , has been the subject of several investigations .",
    "this limit theorem was initially proved by voiculescu @xcite for bounded random variables .",
    "later this result was extended to unbounded variables with finite variance by maassen @xcite ( see also @xcite for a further development ) .",
    "an explanation of the appearance of the semicircle law , both in the free central limit theorem and in the asymptotics of large random matrices , was found by voiculescu in @xcite .    knowing the above results , it is therefore natural to ask whether the superconvergence in the free central limit theorem holds for unbounded random variables . in this paper",
    ", we show that this is indeed the case and even more , in addition to the uniform convergence and analyticity properties of the densities , we also prove a global central limit theorem in the sense of the @xmath0-convergence .",
    "this further implies an entropic central limit theorem , which is a free analogue of barron s classical theorem on the convergence to the normal entropy @xcite .",
    "note that our results are in sharp contrast with the classical central limit theorem , where the distributions in the central limit process could be all atomic .",
    "this paper is written in terms of free convolution .",
    "let @xmath18 be the set of all borel probability measures on the real line @xmath19 .",
    "the free convolution of two measures @xmath20 is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is the probability distribution of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are free random variables with distributions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ( see @xcite for the details of this construction and the book @xcite for a comprehensive introduction to free probability theory ) .    aside from being an interesting subject in itself , the theory of free convolution also plays a significant role in the study of the limit laws for large random matrices .",
    "for example , it was shown in @xcite that if for each @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are independent unitarily invariant @xmath30 hermitian random matrices such that their spectral distributions converge weakly in probability to @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath31 and the sequence @xmath32 is bounded ( where @xmath33 denotes the expectation and @xmath34 the normalized trace ) , then the spectral distribution of @xmath35 converges weakly in probability to the free convolution @xmath21 as @xmath31 .",
    "hence , one can use the free probability tools such as the @xmath36-transform ( see section [ sec2 ] ) to further analyze the limit law of @xmath35 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an introduction to some of the most probabilistic aspects of free probability and its connections with random matrices .",

    "this inversion formula gives a way to extract the density function of a measure from its cauchy transform .",

    "for example , the free entropy is maximized by the standard semicircular law @xmath8 [ with the value @xmath299 among all probability measures with variance one @xcite and both @xmath300 and @xmath293 are monotonically increasing @xcite .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for a survey of free entropy .",
    "our goal here is to prove a free analogue of barron s result .    the key ingredient in the proof of our result is a free logarithmic sobolev inequality first proved by voiculescu @xcite , which requires a further assumption on the regularity of the measure @xmath26 .",
    "suppose that the measure @xmath26 has a density @xmath301 in @xmath302 , and let us assume the support of @xmath26 is bounded for the moment .",
    "then the _ free fisher information _ of the measure @xmath26 is @xmath303 see @xcite , proposition 7.9 , where the following inequality is proved : @xmath304 using random matrix approximations , the inequality ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) is further shown to hold for measures with finite variance , not necessarily having a bounded support ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we can use this generalized version of ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) to obtain the following :    [ theo41 ] let @xmath25 and @xmath4 be as in theorem [ theo34 ] .",
    "then the free entropy @xmath300 converges to the semicircular entropy @xmath305 .",
    "notice first that @xmath306 .",
    "theorem [ theo35 ] shows that the free fisher information @xmath307 converges to @xmath306 as @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath4 has variance one , we conclude , from ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) , that @xmath308 and @xmath309 for sufficiently large @xmath11 . the result follows immediately .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper with the following remark . a version of theorem [ theo41 ] for bounded variables satisfying more restrictive conditions was noted in  @xcite .",
    "here , we only require the variance to be one , which is the most general condition to have the free central limit theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "actually , theorem [ theo41 ] can be extended to any probability measure with finite nonzero variance via a standard translating and scaling procedure by observing that the free entropy @xmath297 is invariant under the translation and @xmath310",
    "the author would like to thank professors haribercovici and roland speicher for their encouragement and valuable help during the course of the investigation .",
    "he is also grateful to professor michael anshelevich for a reference , and to a referee for helpful comments on the preliminary version of this work ."
