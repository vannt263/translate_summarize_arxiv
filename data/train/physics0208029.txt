    "in the struggle of biological organisms to survive and reproduce , processing of information is of central importance .",

    "localization of sources is facilitated by topographic maps of neurons to various parts of the brain@xcite , reflecting the spatial arrangements of signals around the animal .",
    "the barn owl has to rely extensively on sounds to find its prey in the dark , and has consequently developed precise ` auditory space maps . '    by extensive experiments , knudsen and collaborators have shown that the optic tectum of the barn owl has both visual and aural maps of space that are in close registry@xcite .",
    "the visual signal plays a crucial role in aligning the aural map ; experimental manipulations of the owl s sensory experience reveal the plasticity of these maps in young animals , and the instructive role played by the visual experience .",
    "( a recent review , with specific references can be found in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "the current study was motivated by experiments in which owls are fitted with prismatic spectacles that shift the visual fields by a preset degree in the horizontal direction@xcite . in young owls ,",
    "the receptive auditory maps were found to shift to remain in registry with the visual maps , which stayed unchanged .",
    "there is at least one theoretical attempt to explain the registry of neural maps through a ` value ",
    "dependent learning , ' where synaptic connections in a network are enhanced after ` foveation towards an auditory stimulus'@xcite . in this paper",
    "we take a more abstract approach to the coupling of audio  visual maps , and search for neural connections ( receptive fields ) that maximize the information gained from the sensory signals . in earlier studies@xcite , bialek and",
    "one of us formulated an approach to optimization of information in the visual system , and in computations with neural spike trains@xcite .    here , we extend the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite for computing receptive fields in the visual system , to finding the optimal connectivities in an audio - visual cortex , such as the owl s optic tectum .",
    "we find that the shape and registry of the aural map is established by the correlations between the audio and visual signals . in response to an artificial shift of the visual field ( as with the prismatic spectacles ) ,",
    "the visual receptive field is unchanged . while the aural receptive field shifts in the adaptive direction , its shape changes due to the costs of rewiring the neurons .",
    "the general formalism for our calculations is set up in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] , which reviews the methodology introduced in ref .",
    "the essence of this approach is the assumption that neural connections act as _ linear _ filters of the incoming signals , and also introduce noise in the outputs .",
    "if the ( correlated ) input signals , and the random noise , are taken from gaussian probability distributions , the outputs are also gaussian distributed .",
    "the shannon@xcite information content of the resulting outputs is easily calculated .",
    "the task is to find filter functions that maximize this information , subject to biologically motivated costs , and for given correlations of the input signals . in ref .",
    "@xcite this approach was used to obtain receptive fields in the visual system . in sec .",
    "[ avinputs ] , we generalize this formalism to coupled audio - visual signals .",
    "a necessary input to the calculations is the correlations between the audio and visual signals , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ s - correlations ] .",
    "since it is clearly much easier to localize objects by sight that sound , it is reasonable that the information carried by the visual channel should far exceed the aural one .",
    "the two sources of information are however quite likely to be correlated , resulting in couplings between the corresponding filters . in the experiments on barn owls ,",
    "the prismatic glasses shift the visual field and hence modify the correlations between the signals .",
    "we examine how such shifts change the filter functions ( neural connectivities ) that optimize the information content in the outputs .    as argued in sec .",
    "[ results ] , the disparities in the strengths of visual and aural signals simplify the search for optimal filters . in particular , we find that the visual receptive fields are relatively robust and unchangeable , while the shape of the aural receptive field is the product of two terms : one reflects the correlations between sights and sounds , and shifts along with external displacement of these signals ; the second is associated with the costs of making connections to distant neurons .",
    "this result is further interpreted in the final section ( sec .",
    "[ discussions ] ) , where some implications for experiments , as well as directions for future extensions and generalizations , are also discussed .",
    "the processing of information by neural connections in the cortex is modelled in ref .  @xcite as follows : after passing through intermediate stations , sensory signals arrive as a set of inputs @xmath0 .",
    "further processing takes place by neurons that sample the information from a subset of these inputs , and produce an appropriate output .",
    "for ease of calculation , the outputs are represented as a linear transformation of the inputs , according to @xmath1 the filtering of information is thus parameterized by the matrix @xmath2 , and is also assumed to introduce an unavoidable noise @xmath3 .",
    "there are of course many possible sensory inputs , which can be taken from a joint probability distribution @xmath4 $ ] . equation  ( [ filter ] ) is thus a transformation from one set of random variables ( the inputs ) to another ( the outputs ) ; the latter described by the joint probability distribution function @xmath5 $ ] .",

    "the shannon information can be calculated easily for gaussian distributed random variables .",

    "( [ gauss - info ] ) , with @xmath20    we are interested in describing cortical maps related to visual or aural localization of objects .",
    "these locations vary continuously in space , and are topographically mapped to positions on a two - dimensional cortex . as such , it is convenient to promote the indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 , used above to label output and input neurons , to continuous vectors in two dimensional space . for example , following ref .",

    "the task is to find the function @xmath37 which maximizes the information @xmath41 .",
    "clearly , we need to impose certain costs on this function , since otherwise the information gain can become enormous for @xmath42 .",

    "it imposes a penalty for creating connections which increases quadratically with the length of the connection .",
    "our central conclusion is in fact insensitive to the form of @xmath45 .",
    "if the costs are prohibitive , there will be no filtering of signals .",
    "to avoid such cases , we compare only filters that are constrained such that @xmath46 ( or any other constant ) . in the optimization process",
    ", this constraint can be implemented via a lagrange multiplier , resulting in an effective cost similiar to the term proportional to @xmath47 in eq .",

    "some specific features of this result in connection with the coupled visual and aural maps are :    * the shape of the aural receptive field is very much controlled by the visual information , modulated by the costs associated with neural connectivities . * artificially displacing the two signal sources , as in the case of the prismatic spectacles used on the barn owls@xcite , modifies the aural receptive field . however , the resulting receptive field is not simply shifted ( unless the costs of neural wirings are negligible ) , but also changes its shape . * equation  ( [ fa ] ) is the product of two functions , one peaked at the origin and the other at @xmath112 .",
    "depending of the relative strengths and widths of these two peaks , the receptive field may be more sensitive to signals at the original , or in the shifted location . * the experiments",

    "the tasks of the sensory systems are more apparent : to extract the relevant signals from the background of natural inputs , and as a first step to localize the source of the signal in the external world .",
    "it is possible to experimentally gather information about the correlations of various signals in the natural world , and there are indeed several studies of the statistics of various aspects of visual images@xcite .",
    "of course , such statistics are also specific to the instrument ( e.g. camera ) used to obtain the image .",
    "more relevant are psycho - physical studies that probe how individuals parse the visual information@xcite .",
    "we are not aware of similar studies on the statistics of natural sounds in different directions , and their correlations with visual signals .",
    "such studies may provide part of the material needed for a more detailed study .",
    "the outcome of the procedure outlined in this paper is a set of filter functions , which are hopefully related to the actual connections between neurons .",
    "the shape and range of such connections can be studied directly by injection of biocytin dye@xcite , and indirectly by mapping the receptive field of a neuron via a microelectrode probe .",
    "detailed studies of this kind for the owls reared with prismatic spectacles , and their comparison with eq .",
    "( [ fa ] ) may provide insights about the cost of making neural connections , another necessary input to our general formalism .",
    "the analytical formalism itself can be extended in several directions .",
    "already , in ref .  @xcite it was proposed that colored images can be studied by considering a vector signal @xmath113 ranging over the color wheel . in regards to different sensory inputs , we may can also ask if and when it is advantageous to segregate outputs to distinct cortical areas , allowing for distinct maps @xmath114 . a more ambitious goal is to extend the formalism to time dependent signals , allowing for filters with appropriate time delays that attempt to take advantage of temporal patterns in the signals .",
