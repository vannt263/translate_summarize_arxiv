    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in ultracold , trapped dilute alkali gases , beyond realizing a striking and spectacular experimental confirmation of a long - standing , fundamental prediction of quantum theory , has initiated and stimulated as well a whole new field of research in the physics of quantum gases in confined geometries @xcite .",
    "nowaday , many different atomic species and isotopes can be succesfully cooled and trapped in the gaseous state , to investigate in exceptional conditions of purity and isolation the properties of interacting bose and fermi systems , or bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "in particular , the experimental realizations of trapped gaseous mixtures of bosons and fermions are both an interesting new instance of a quantum many - body system and a very useful tool to reach the regime of quantum degeneracy for a fermi gas via sympathetic cooling of the fermions by the bosons @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , dilute bose - fermi mixtures have been the object of recent investigations addressing , for example , the determination of the density profiles of the two components in trapped systems @xcite , the problem of stability and phase separation @xcite , and the effect of boson - fermion interactions on the dynamics @xcite and on the ground - state properties @xcite of the mixture .",
    "boson - fermion interactions in a bose - fermi mixture can induce a net attractive interaction between the fermions , thus introducing a further mechanism toward the achievement of the bcs transition in trapped fermi gases @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address the reverse problem , i.e. how the transition temperature of bose - einstein condensation is affected by the presence of the fermions in a trapped mixture .",
    "the shift of the transition temperature @xmath0 due to interactions in a pure trapped bose system has been calculated within the mean - field approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we extend the perturbative methods of ref .",

    "the effect on @xmath0 of boson - boson and boson - fermion interactions are independent and add linearly .",
    "the relative importance of the two effects depends on the relevant parameters of the trapped mixture : number of bosons and fermions in the trap , ratio of the masses and of the oscillator frequencies for the two species and the ratio of the bose - bose and bose - fermi coupling constants .",
    "the calculation is carried out in local density approximation which is valid provided that the number of bosons and fermions in the trap is large .",
    "finite size effects have not been included in the present treatment .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii we generalize the scheme derived for pure bose systems in ref .",

    "iii we derive analytical results for the shift of @xmath0 in the limits of a highly degenerate ( thomas - fermi ) and a classical ( boltzmann ) fermi gas , and we provide the full numerical solution for the intermediate regimes .",

    "interparticle interactions have an effect on the bec transition temperature as well .",
    "the presence of repulsive interactions has the effect of expanding the atomic cloud , with a consequent decrease of the density . lowering the peak density has then the effect of lowering the critical temperature . on the contrary ,",
    "attractive interactions produce an increase of the density and thus an increase of @xmath0 .",

    "it is important to remark that , even if the bose - fermi shift of the critical temperature is a small effect for the present experimental conditions , it might be observable . since the fermions can be eliminated from the trap , one can look for the differences in the transition temperature with and without fermions .    in conclusion",
