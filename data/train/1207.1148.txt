    "in the preceding companion paper@xcite , henceforth referred to as paper i or simply i , we have obtained the exact solutions for the governing equations for nonequilibrium pair distribution functions and potentials in a brownian motion model , and also the solutions for the stokes equation@xcite , which yield the velocity of the countercurrent induced by the motion of ions in a binary strong electrolyte solutions under the influence of an external electric field . therewith we obtained the general formulas for the electrophoretic and relaxation time factors that can be made use of to define the divergence - free electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients with which we may calculate ionic conductance of binary electrolyte solutions .",
    "since the electrophoretic and relaxation time factors , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , obtained are for all allowable values of position ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , it is necessary to select an appropriate position or a set of positions that must yield divergence - free electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the position of the center ion of the ion atmosphere at the given value of external field strength @xmath4 we have first determined the shape of ion atmosphere from the projection @xmath5 of the axial velocity profile and obtained the coordinates of its center position .",
    "then therewith we can calculate the electrohoretic and relaxation time coefficients as functions of external field strength @xmath4 .",
    "the salient point of the procedure put forward here is that since the center position ( @xmath6 ) of the ion atmosphere moves along the @xmath2 axis from the origin as @xmath4 increases , the electrophoretic coefficient for the center ion must be calculated for the moving spherical ion atmosphere at each value of @xmath4 , which follows the trajectory described in fig .",
    "7 of paper i , and therewith the ionic conductance . in this connection",
    ", it should be recalled that wilson@xcite evaluated the electrophoretic coefficient  for the center ion located at the coordinate origin @xmath7 for all values of @xmath4 , which consequently gives rise to a divergent term that must be discarded to obtain a finite electrophoretic coefficient .",
    "such a divergent integral arises mainly because @xmath7 is taken for the center ion position for the ion atmosphere even if @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , his procedure ignores the fact that the ion atmosphere not only is distorted , but also migrates in the field direction under the influece of an external field .",
    "therefore the coordinate position in the electrophoretic and relaxation time factors must be other than @xmath7 and also a function of @xmath4 .    in the present paper",
    ", we would like to apply this important point of observation to calculate the electrophoretic coefficient and the corresponding relaxation time coefficient , and therewith the equivalent ionic conductance in the nonlinear regime of the field strength as a function of @xmath4 ; in particular , the wien effect@xcite on equivalent conductance . thus we would like to show that the onsager ",
    "wilson theory@xcite is basically capable of predicting in an excellent accuracy a marked deviation from coulomb s law of conduction if we avoid wilson s procedure of taking @xmath7 in the electrophoretic and relaxation time coeffficient formulas .",
    "when they are calculated according to our procedure , the equivalent ionic conductance compares well with experimental data on magnesium sulfate solution available in the literature@xcite . as a matter of fact , when the electrophoretic coefficient @xmath9 and the relaxation time coefficient @xmath10 thus calculated according to our procedure , the present method becomes not only divergence - free , but also improves the accuracy of the onsager ",

    "the notation is the same as in paper i , but we reiterate that @xmath20 is the reduced external field strength and @xmath21 therefore , we see that @xmath12 is a measure of variation@xcite in the external body - force on the nonequilibrium ion atmosphere that has resulted from the originally spherical ion atmosphere of radius @xmath22 ( in reduced units ) .    in fig .",

    "in particular , the outermost curve @xmath5 denotes the locus of zero of the surface as the intersection with the ( @xmath25 ) plane .",
    "the appearance of two quasi - ellipses making up the locus @xmath5 implies that there are two velocity components , axial and transversal , developing as the external field is increased from zero .",
    "it also means that the spherical ion atmosphere formed in the electrolyte solution at equilibrium when the external field is absent deforms into two quasi - ellipses , one along the @xmath2 axis and the other along the @xmath3 axis transversal to the @xmath2 axis .",

    "therefore , the spherical ion atmosphere displays two regions of opposite signs and the conductance of ions is contributed by ions in the exterior shell , and the electrophoretic coefficient should be calculated with the force by the flowing medium acting on the sphere ( i.e. , ion atmosphere ) of radius @xmath29 , part of which is exterior to @xmath5 , but centered at @xmath38 .",
    "this means the transversal distance to the @xmath2 axis ( i.e. , the radial distance ) on the spherical ion atmosphere of radius @xmath29 ( in reduced units used here ) in question is @xmath39 from the coordinate origin ( the original center ) .",

    "there is only one independent diffusion coefficient , and the linear thermodynamic force  flux relation or the constitutive equation for diffusion may be written as@xmath71 where @xmath72 is the diffusion coefficient of species @xmath63 . since the diffusion flux is defined relative to a reference velocity by the formula@xcite@xmath73 where @xmath74 is the reference velocity suitably chosen , such as the barycentric velocity , which obeys the hydrodynamic equations of the solution .",
    "there are other possibilities chosen for the reference velocity in the literature@xcite .",
    "however , in the theory of conductance in electrolyte solutions the barycentric velocity is generally used , and if the kinetic theory@xcite of diffusion is developed , @xmath74 is exactly what appears in the equation for the diffusion flux .",
    "since we are generally interested in mobilities in the conductance experiments , it is required to calculate @xmath75 itself of species @xmath63 instead of the diffusion flux @xmath62 .",

    "the ow theory prediction is much smaller than the experimental conductance .",
    "furthermore , the low field ( @xmath116 ) behavior predicted by the wilson s result appears to be markedly different from the experimental data and the present theoretical prediction , the latter being almost linear with respect to @xmath4 , while wilson s prediction appears to be nonlinear , i.e. , @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "we believe that the procedure used for selecting the @xmath2 and @xmath3 used for calculation of the electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients and thus the ionic conductance appears to be well supported by the comparison made .",
    "ionic liquids are ubiquitous and it is important to understand their physical behaviors in physical , chemical , and biological systems under the influence of external electromagnetic fields . onsager s",
    "theory@xcite of conductance is an important benchmark in the development of the theory of transport processes in ionic solutions , although his theory appears to have been almost forgotten about and paid little attention these days except one recent work@xcite .",
    "we believe it is unwarranted to ignore his basic ideas on the subject matter because the theory seems to provide much  valuable insight for further development of theories of transport processes in ionic solutions and plasmas . in the present series of papers , we have revisited and examined the details of his theories and have been able to obtain full evaluations of the formal results of the ow theory .",
    "the preceding@xcite and present papers describe our understanding of the inner workings of his theories and their application to an experimental system .",
    "we have found that the solutions of the of equations@xcite , the poisson equations@xcite , and stokes equation@xcite for the velocity of the medium would require a more mathematically complete treatment than originally implemented in wilson s dissertation@xcite , especially , to avoid divergence difficulty that  was unfortunately not dealt with squarely . in paper",
    "i@xcite we have exactly evaluated the formulas for the axial and transversal velocities in a binary electrolyte solution , which may be deemed one of the goals of the theory of ionic conductance . in the present paper , we have applied the axial velocity formula to calculate the equivalent conductance of a binary strong electrolyte , having elucidated the appropriate set of @xmath119 to use by a computation - based procedure to select a unique set of ( @xmath25 ) as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "although this procedure lacks a precise theoretical foundation based on irreversible thermodynamics or hydrodynamics , it does provide us with an unambiguous procedure to obtain correct estimates of conductance over the entire range of @xmath4 experimentally studied . in this sense",
    ", we may conclude that it is a practical and useful procedure for understanding the experimental data . in any case",
    ", the procedure is founded on the observation of how the ion atmosphere behaves in the applied external field .",
    "the study of its behavior with respect to the field not only provides much insight into the interplay between the long - range coulombic interactions between charged particles and the interaction of the ion atmosphere with the external field producing a rather intricate ionic liquid structure , but also shows how charged species diffuse in such a liquid under the influence of the applied electric field .",
    "this picture of the ionic liquid behavior that we have gained in the present paper owes to the fact that the brownian movement model , namely , the solutions of the governing equations , provides us with exact nonequilibrium distribution functions , ionic potentials , and velocity profiles that can be evaluated rigorously either numerically of analytically .",
    "this latter feature is an indispensable aspect of the ow theory of ionic solutions we have shown possible in this work .",
    "we emphasize that the present work disposes of the divergence difficulty inherent to wilson s procedure@xcite , which arose from an inadequate treatment of the fourier transform integrals for the solutions , and the theory of wien effect is thereby made practically amenable to theoretical investigation and satisfactorily accountable theoretically .",
    "the theoretical significance of the onsager theory of electrolytic conductance@xcite lies in its ability to take into account the non - linear field dependence in the form of local body - force that is obtained through the onsager ",
    "fuoss equations@xcite for the pair distribution functions and the poisson equations@xcite which are coupled together .",
    "the local body - force thus obtained is then made use of in the stokes equation for the velocity of the medium subjected to the external electric field .",
    "the present paper enables us to conclude that the onsager theory is now made capable of treating conduction phenomena of dilute electrolyte solutions irrespective of the applied field strength and predicts a correct behavior qualitatively and quantitatively in contrast to the conclusion drawn in the literature in the past that it predicts too small values for equivalent conductance@xcite .",
    "thus it , in fact , appears to provide a great deal of insights into diverse electrical conduction phenomena in subjects other than traditional electrolyte solutions studied in physical chemistry , which are lately studied under different guises and subject names , such as semiconductors@xcite , ionic liquids@xcite , ion channels@xcite , plasmas@xcite , etc . , but still involve charged species subjected to an external electric field gradient , often rather strong because of small system sizes commonly studied in recent years .",
    "therefore the basic physics underlying the phenomena in the aforementioned subject fields is unchanged other than sizes of the systems and conditions , and in this respect onsager s theory can give us a valuable lesson on how to treat ionic solutions and ionized gases in external electromagnetic fields .    in this work and also in the ow theory@xcite , the treatment of the thermodynamic force ",
    "flux relation is still that of linear irreversible processes , that is , the constitutive relations for ionic motion and flow of the medium are those of the theory of linear irreversible processes@xcite .",
    "in addition to this restriction , it is a theory limited to sufficiently dilute electrolyte solutions .",
    "therefore these two important restrictions must be removed for a more comprehensive theory of electric conductivity in experimental systems of current interest .",
    "we leave these aspects to future studies , but just refer to reader to refs .",
