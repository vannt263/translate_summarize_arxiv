    "very faint x  ray transients ( vfxts ) display outburst peak luminosities in the range @xmath11@xmath12  erg  s@xmath8 ( 210 kev ) , almost two or three orders of magnitude fainter than the emission typically shown by most galactic x  ray transients @xcite .",
    "this , together with their apparently small duty cycles , suggests that these black holes or neutron stars in binary systems undergo a very low average accretion rate @xcite . to date , about 30 vfxts are known and they very likely form a non - homogeneous class of objects , because their only common feature is the low luminosity .",
    "about one third exhibit type - i x - ray bursts ( @xcite ) and can thus be identified with neutron stars accreting matter from a low mass companion , but the nature of the remaining sources is unknown @xcite .    is a hard transient discovered in the direction of the galactic bulge with   in 2004 @xcite .",
    "the source underwent an outburst lasting at least two weeks with a peak flux of 1.1@xmath7  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath8 ( 20150 kev ) @xcite .",
    "for an assumed distance of 8  kpc , this corresponds to a luminosity of 8@xmath410@xmath13  erg  s@xmath8 , which led to classify  as a vfxt .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported on a renewed x  ray activity started on august 28th , 2010 , from a transient previously named . given the positional coincidence , they suggested that  and  are the same source .",
    "observations confirmed the renewed activity of and its association with  @xcite .    following this outburst , we triggered a  too observation , with the main aim of an in - depth investigation of the nature of this source . the observation was performed on 2010 september , 910 , about 13 days after the on - set of the outburst .",
    "we also analyzed  data of the source field obtained , as part of the publicly available galactic bulge program@xcite , overlapping with the  observations .",
    "the  observatory @xcite carries three 1500  @xmath14 x  ray telescopes , each with epic imaging spectrometers at the focus .",
    "two of the epic use mos ccds @xcite and one uses a pn ccd @xcite .",
    "rgs arrays @xcite are located behind two of the telescopes .",
    "was observed with  on 2010 september 910 .",
    "epic pn operated in large window mode , while both mos cameras were in full frame mode , with all the ccds in imaging mode .",
    "both mos and pn observations used the medium thickness filter .",
    "data were reprocessed using version 10.0 of the science analysis software ( sas ) .",
    "known hot , or flickering , pixels and electronic noise were rejected .",
    "the background ( selected with pattern=0 and above 10 kev ) did not show evidence of flaring activity , so no further temporal selection was applied , resulting in net exposures times of 18.5  ks and 21.6  ks , respectively for pn and mos .",
    "extraction radii of 40  and 1  were used for the source spectra , respectively for the pn and mos cameras .",
    "background counts were obtained from similar sized region offset from the source position , resulting in a net count rate of 10.65@xmath15  counts  s@xmath8 in the pn spectrum .",
    "response and ancillary matrix files were generated using the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen . using the sas task epatplot we found that only the mos spectra were affected by pile - up .",
    "thus , we excluded the inner 6  ( radius ) of the psf from the mos1 and mos2 spectra adopting only pattern=0 , while for epic pn spectrum we selected pattern from 0 to 4 .    to ensure applicability of the  statistics , the net spectra were rebinned such that at least 20 counts per bin were present and such that the energy resolution was not over - sampled by more than a factor 3 .",
    "all spectral uncertainties and upper - limits given below are at the 90% confidence level for one parameter of interest .",
    "we performed the data analysis using heasoft 6.10 and xspec v.12 .",
    "the rgs was operated in spectroscopy mode and resulted in a net exposure of 21.6  ks .",
    "rgs source and background events were calibrated by applying the latest calibration parameters .",
    "we analyzed the data of the galactic bulge monitoring program in the time - frame close to the source outburst as detected by _",
    "rxte _ on august 28th , 2010 .",
    "we used the imager ibis / isgri ( @xcite , @xcite ) on - board _ integral _",
    "@xcite , and analyzed a total of 68 pointings , each with an exposure time of about 1800s ( nominal ) , spanning from august 26 , 2010 to october 6 , 2010 .",
    "version 9.0 of the off - line scientific analysis ( osa ) software was used to analyse the data . for each pointing we extracted images in the energy bands (",
    "the boundaries have been chosen in order to cope with the response matrix ) .",
    "the images were used to build one - pointing based light - curves as well as a final mosaic .",
    "the source has never been detected at a single pointing level , or at a one mosaic per revolution level , but it is clearly detected in the total mosaic ( see fig  [ isgri ] ) .",
    "we extracted an average spectrum from the total mosaic using the mosaic_spec tool available within the osa  9.0 software package .",
    "the light curves of  observed with the epic pn in the soft ( 0.32 kev ) and hard ( 212 kev ) energy ranges are shown in fig .",
    "a similar behaviour is displayed by source emission observed with both mos1 and mos2 .",
    "the average flux does not vary during the observation , but some rapid variability is present .",
    "this is clearly visible in the power spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ timing ] , which has been obtained by averaging the power spectra ( 0.312 kev ) of 391 time intervals of 51.2  s each , binned at 0.1  s. the fractional rms variability , integrated over the 0.011 hz range , is about 20% .",
    "the hardness ratio between the soft and hard energy ranges ( bottom panel of fig .  [ pnlc ] ) is consistent with a constant value .",
    "a fit with a constant gives a value of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 for 156 d.o.f . ) .",
    "therefore in the following we perform a spectral analysis integrating over the whole duration of the observation .",
    "the low statistics hampers a meaningful temporal analysis at hard energies , since the source is not detected in single pointings , but only in the total mosaic of the summed ibis / isgri observations ( see section  [ interedu ] ) .      fitting the epic spectra ( pn+mos1+mos2 ) with an absorbed power law resulted in structured residuals near 2.2 kev and below 1 kev , which can be ascribed to residual uncertainties in the calibration .",
    "the largest departure of the data with respect to the model is due to narrow negative residuals near 2.2 kev present in the epic pn , likely due to an incorrect instrumental modeling of the gold mirror edges , as already noticed , for example , in the  spectrum of gro  j1655 - 40 @xcite .",
    "the other discrepancies present around and below 1 kev have often been observed in other x  ray binaries , especially in case of hard x  ray emission ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some authors usually exclude the softest part of epic data , other include gaussian lines to account for these residuals ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "here we decided to not exclude particular energy ranges , but instead to include a 2% systematic error in epic data , both when fitting the epic spectra alone ( pn+mos1+mos2 ) , and when fitting them together with isgri higher energy spectrum .",
    "other authors adopted similar or even higher systematic errors @xcite to account for these residual discrepancies .",
    "note however that , if we perform the spectroscopy only considering the higher energy range 2.5 - 10 kev ( epic data ) , the resulting spectral parameters are always consistent with the results we are reporting in the following paragraphs .",
    "the spectroscopy of the epic data alone ( 0.510 kev ) with an absorbed power law ( @xmath18 for 640 d.o.f ) resulted in the following parameters : @xmath19=(5.10@xmath20@xmath4@xmath5 @xmath6 , photon index , @xmath0 , of 1.61@xmath1 .",
    "adopting alternative simple models resulted in much worse fits : a multicolour disk blackbody ( diskbb in xspec ) or a simple blackbody gave @xmath21@xmath105 .",
    "additional soft components to the power law model , as well as a high energy exponential cut - off , were not required by the data .",
    "other complex fits , e.g. a multicolour disk blackbody ( diskbb in xspec ) plus a blackbody , although formally acceptable ( @xmath21=1.100 for 638 d.o.f . ) , underestimated the flux seen higher energies with , thus requiring an additional hard power law component .",
    "the rgs spectra ( 0.52 kev ) resulted in net source count rates of 0.150@xmath22  counts  s@xmath8 and 0.192@xmath22  counts  s@xmath8 respectively in rgs1 and rgs2 .",
    "rgs spectra did not show evidence for narrow lines .",
    "an absorbed power law was a good fit to the data ( @xmath23 for 3038 d.o.f . ) resulting in a column density in the range [ 0.570.77]@xmath4@xmath24 @xmath6 and a photon index , @xmath0 , between 1.48 and 2.10 ( 90% uncertainty ) .",
    "this is consistent with the epic results , so we will not discuss the rgs data further .",
    "the /isgri spectrum ( 17.8150.4 kev ) displayed a slope consistent with the one seen with  below 10 kev : a fit with a power law resulted in a photon index of 1.7@xmath25 ( @xmath26 for 3 d.o.f . ) .",
    "we next analysed the broad band 0.5150 kev emission with a joint fit of /epic",
    "( pn+mos  1+mos  2 ) and /isgri .",
    "we included constant factors in the spectral fitting to allow for normalization uncertainties between the instruments .",
    "an absorbed power law model resulted in a good fit ( @xmath27/d.o.f.=1.091/644 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the best - fit spectral parameters are equal to those obtained for the epic spectrum alone and the isgri / epic pn constant factor was 1.17@xmath28 .",
    "the fluxes corrected for the absorption are the following : f=6.8@xmath29  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath8 and f=2.4@xmath7  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath8 , respectively in the 110 kev and 1100 kev energy ranges ( assuming the epic pn response matrix extrapolated to higher energies ) . fitting the epic and isgri data with a power law with a high - energy exponential cut - off ( cutoffpl model in xspec ) allows us to put a lower limit to the cut - off energy , e@xmath30 , of @xmath3150  kev ( fig .  [ cont2 ] , 90% confidence level ) .",
    "we also tried a double component model , adding a soft component to the power law continuum : using a blackbody together with a power law , we obtained a blackbody temperature of 0.61@xmath32  kev and a small radius r@xmath33 = 0.80 @xmath34  km ( at a distance of 8  kpc ; @xmath27/d.o.f.=1.082/642 ) .",
    "an f - test resulted in a probability of @xmath35 .",
    "similar risults were obtained assuming a diskbb model for the additional component ( @xmath27/d.o.f.=1.080/642 ; f - test probability of @xmath36 ) , resulting in an inner disc temperature of 1.2 @xmath37  kev and in an innermost disc radius , r@xmath38@xmath39 , of 0.20@xmath40  km at 8 kpc ( @xmath41 is the disc inclination ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that , even if we can not rule out the presence of a weak additional soft component , there is no statistical evidence for its presence in the current data .",
    "cccc +    we next tried to describe the broad - band spectrum with physical models which involve a comptonizing plasma , like comptt and bmc in xspec .",
    "a fit with the comptt model @xcite returns a scenario with cold seed photons ( 0.050.09kev ) upscattered by a corona ( disc geometry ) with optical depth @xmath42=1.5@xmath43 and electron temperature kt@xmath44@xmath1020kev ( @xmath27/d.o.f.=1.080/642 ) .",
    "we also fit the data with the bmc model @xcite .",
    "this model is the sum of a blackbody ( bb ) plus its comptonization , the latter obtained as a consistent convolution of the bb itself with green s function of the compton corona .",
    "the free parameters of the bmc model ( apart from the normalization ) are the bb colour temperature , kt@xmath45 , the spectral energy index , @xmath46 , and the logarithm of the illuminating factor a , log  a. the log  a parameter is an indication of the fraction of the up - scattered bb photons with respect to the bb seed photons directly visible . in the extreme cases ,",
    "the seed photons can be completely embedded in the comptonizing cloud ( none directly visible , a@xmath47 1 , e.g. log  a=8 ) or there is no coverage by the compton cloud ( a@xmath481 , e.g. log  a=@xmath49 ) , and we directly observe the seed photon spectrum ( equivalent to a simple bb , with no comptonization ) . in our case",
    "we obtain ( @xmath27/d.o.f.=1.027/642 ) a kt@xmath45=0.07@xmath50kev , seed photon population up - scattered with @xmath46=0.64@xmath51 and log(a)=@xmath520.24@xmath53 .",
    "we note that the bmc model has no cut - off in it ( i.e. we are in the power - law shape case ) and the well constrained @xmath46 parameter ( @xmath0=@xmath46 + 1 ) indicates the overall comptonization efficiency related to an observable quantity in the photon spectrum of the data ( the slope @xmath46 , unlike kt@xmath44 and @xmath42 that are not directly observable in the spectrum ) .",
    "the lower the @xmath46 value , the higher the efficiency , that is , the higher the energy transfer from the hot electrons to the soft seed photons .",
    "our  too observation of /  triggered by its recent outburst , coupled with simultaneous integral data , allowed us to derive the first broad band spectrum ( 0.5150 kev ) of this vfxt . during this outburst , the second shown by this source in almost seven years , follow - up observations were carried out with different satellites and ground based telescopes .",
    "the source position was first refined thanks to a /xrt pointing @xcite .",
    "this ruled out all the six sources detected with  in the error circle when  was in quiescence @xcite as possible soft x ",
    "ray counterparts .",
    "a sub  arcsecond position was later determined with  @xcite , leading to the identification of a likely optical counterpart ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this star , at coordinates r.a .",
    "( j2000 ) = 17@xmath54  28@xmath5538.86@xmath56 , dec ( j2000 ) = @xmath57  21@xmath58  44.0@xmath59 @xcite , appeared bluer and more variable than other candidates inside the  error region .",
    "it was not detected in archival optical images taken three months before the last outburst , with an upper limit of r - magnitude@xmath1021 @xcite .",
    "the faintness of the optical counterpart in quiescence allows us to better constrain the source nature and its distance . in the following , we use a visual extinction a@xmath60=2.4 mag ( which implies a@xmath61=1.8 mag ) ,",
    "derived from the absorbing column density resulting from the x  ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "a hmxb can be excluded , because , even if placed at the galactic boundaries , it would have a brighter r magnitude .",
    "for example , to have r@xmath1021  mag , a b0v star should lie at a distance larger than 450  kpc , and a b0.5 supergiant star at more than 1.6  mpc .",
    "the source is more likely a lmxb , being fully compatible with the observed constraint : for example , a k5v companion star ( assuming m@xmath60=@xmath62 , v@xmath52r=@xmath63 ; @xcite ) , placed at 8  kpc , would show a magnitude r@xmath312223 . on the other hand , the measured upper limit r@xmath1021  mag would imply a lmxb distance larger than @xmath314  kpc .",
    "thus , we conclude that  is a lmxb located at a distance greater than 4  kpc .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     during its first outburst in 2003 ,  was caught at first in a soft state with the @xmath64 satellite , consistent with a steep power law with a photon index of 3.63.8 @xcite .",
    "then , during  observations performed about one month later , the 20150 kev spectrum seemed to be harder , with @xmath0=2.1@xmath65 @xcite .    during the evolution of the second outburst in 2010 ( see table  [ tab : history ] and fig  [ fig : history ] ) , the source spectrum was apparently harder when fainter , with a continuum always dominated by a power law with a slope within the canonical range for the low - hard state in lmxbs ( @xmath0@xmath311.51.7 for bh binaries , hereafter bhb , @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior ( low - hard state during the entire outburst ) is consistent with a bh nature , although the canonical evolution of the outburst in a bh transient ( bht ) starts with a low - hard state and then undergoes a transition to a high - soft state , where the thermal emission from the accretion disc dominates the x  ray spectrum , following a q - shaped behavior in the hardness - intensity diagram ( see the recent review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , not all bhts go through low - hard to high - soft states during their outbursts , but a few of them remain in the low - hard state until they return to quiescence ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the  broad - band x - ray spectrum we have reported here , if fitted with physical models ( see section  [ section : spec ] ) , draws a scenario compatible with the typical low hard state of a lmxb ( cold and distant disc comptonized by a hot corona ) , but little can be said from the spectral point of view on the nature of the compact object , since a plasma temperature of kt@xmath44@xmath1020kev ( and @xmath0=@xmath46 + 1=1.6 ) has been observed in both bh and neutron star lmxbs ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "observations suggest that quiescent bhts as a class are fainter than transients containing a neutron star with similar orbital periods ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "tomsick et al . (",
    "2008 ) found six faint sources within the  error circle during a  observation when the source was in quiescence , thus leading to an unclear counterpart .",
    "taking the brightest of these faint  sources , they calculated a conservative upper limit to the x  ray emission in quiescence of 5.56.4@xmath410@xmath66  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath8 ( 0.310 kev unabsorbed flux , assuming power law photon indices between @xmath0=1 and 2 ) . a refined error circle allowed to exclude @xcite , as possible soft x",
    " ray counterparts , all these six  sources .",
    "thus we can re - calculate these upper limits to the quiescent emission , rescaling these fluxes at least to the faintest  source in the error circle , resulting in a new upper limit of 2.42.8 @xmath410@xmath66  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath8 ( 0.310 kev , unabsorbed flux , assuming @xmath0=12 ) .",
    "this translates into an x  ray luminosity in quiescence l@xmath67@xmath68(1.72.0)@xmath4(d@xmath69@xmath70)@xmath410@xmath71  erg  s@xmath8 , where d@xmath69 is the source distance in units of 8  kpc .",
    "if  is located closer than the galactic centre , this conservative upper limit to the quiescence becomes low and possibly indicative of a bhb .",
    "neither x  ray pulsations nor type i x  ray bursts have been observed .",
    "the power density spectrum ( pds ) measured with  resembles the typical shape and normalization of aperiodic variability in low - hard states of lmxbs ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but nothing really conclusive can be said about the nature of the compact object .",
    "this observation , although leading to the first broad - band spectroscopy up to 150  kev , demonstrated that it is very difficult to discriminate a black hole from a neutron star in a vfxt . from the spectral point of view , it does not exist , to date , a firm spectral signature which allows to distinguish a black hole from a neutron star , especially if the x  ray transient remains in a low / hard state along the entire outburst .",
    "the same can be said about the power density spectrum in the frequencies range of our data : a possible way to distinguish a black hole from a neutron star was proposed by @xcite , but it involves power density spectra at higher frequencies , above 500  hz . moreover , in vfxts ( @xmath72  m@xmath73  yr@xmath8 ) hosting accreting neutron stars , the type i x  ray bursts seem to be rare ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although a proper comparison with the different possible explanations ( e.g. @xcite ) needs more observational data , especially on the bursts recurrence time at different accretion regimes .",
