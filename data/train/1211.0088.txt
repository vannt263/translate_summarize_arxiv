    "one of the important properties of @xmath1 is the equivalent width ( ew ) , which measures the ratio of @xmath1 flux to that of the uv continuum , and therefore provides useful information of the emission mechanisms and photon escape processes in galaxies .    unlike uv continuum ,",
    "@xmath1 photons typically experience many scattering process in galaxies due to its large scattering cross section .",
    "these scatterings may prolong the path length and increase the probability of dust absorption , leading to reduction in the emergent luminosity .",
    "hence , the ew can change significantly due to the difference in the radiative transfer ( rt ) process between @xmath1 and uv continuum .",
    "if the escape fraction of @xmath1 is the same as that of the uv continuum , the upper limit of the ew is determined by the intrinsic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the stars .",
    "it has been suggested that in the case of a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , the upper limit is @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , a large number of laes at @xmath0 have large ews higher than @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "more recently , @xcite detected a lae with extremely large ew of @xmath6 at @xmath7 .",
    "the origin of such high ews is largely unknown .",
    "it has been proposed that the large ews may be produced by a top - heavy imf of popiii stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , so far there is no evidence of a top - heavy imf in high - redshift laes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a popiii - dominated galaxy .",
    "another model used a salpeter imf but invoked clumpy interstellar medium @xcite . in this model ,",
    "uv continuum is assumed to be absorbed by dust passing through the dense clouds , but @xmath1 photons do not experience the dust absorption because they can not enter the clouds due to surface scattering .",
    "however , this is an idealized , optically thin case for the @xmath1 photons in emitting regions between the dense clouds .",
    "in fact , most of the stars form in high density clouds , they ionize the gas and create @xmath8 regions which emit @xmath1 photons",
    ". these photons then travel in the dense clouds and may experience strong dust extinction .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the escape of @xmath1 and continuum photons from star - forming galaxies by combining a cosmological simulation with three - dimensional radiative transfer calculations , and found no correlation between the ew and clumpiness of the ism .",
    "in addition , laursen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) studied the ews of modeled galaxies with clumpy ism , and showed that it was difficult to boost the ew with the typical physical state of laes . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that collisional excitation from accretion of cold hydrogen gas by galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath9 ) significantly enhances the @xmath1 emission and boost the ew .",
    "it is not clear , however , from our previous studies whether or not cold accretion is the only dominant mechanism to produce a large ew . in many rt calculations ,",
    "all @xmath1 photons were assumed to escape instantaneously with the uv continuum .",
    "however , since the ionization of hydrogen evolves with time , this time - dependent propagation of the ionization front may cause a delay of the escape of the @xmath1 photons @xcite , which in turn may affect the @xmath1 properties .",

    "our galaxy model consists of one - dimensional spherical shells of hydrogen gas in a spherical navarro - frenk - white dark matter halo @xcite , similar to that of @xcite .",
    "the dark matter halo has a concentration parameter @xmath10 @xcite at the virial temperature of the halo as derived by @xcite at @xmath11 .",

    "a total of 100 shells are constructed for each galaxy .",
    "in addition , we assume star formation takes place at the center of the galaxy , with the rate sfr proportional to the halo mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and decays exponentially ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are amplitude factor of peak sfr and star formation timescale respectively . in this work ,",

    "the sfr has an initial value of @xmath54 , but exponentially decreases with time .",
    "since ionizing photons mainly come from massive , young stars , they are strongly correlated with sfr . as a result ,",

    ", the ionized region is confined in the galaxy , then it grows with increasing stellar mass . in this phase ,",
    "the @xmath1 photons are also confined in the galaxy , hence the ew is very small .",
    "however , when the ionization front reaches the virial radius , the trapped @xmath1 photons can escape simultaneously .",
    "this sudden release of @xmath1 photons causes very high ews , which peaks @xmath75 , much higher than the upper limit predicted by the model in which all @xmath1 photons escape instantaneously",
    ".    moreover , the peak of ew decreases with increasing halo mass . in low - mass galaxies ,",
    "the potential well is shallow , and the virial radius @xmath56 is small , therefore it is easy for the ionizing photons to propagate and reach @xmath56 quickly .",
    "since the ionization timescale of small galaxies is shorter than that of massive ones , by the end of ionization , a larger ratio of massive ( @xmath76 ) to intermediate - mass stars may result due to the short lifetimes of massive stars .",
    "this would lead to larger ews because more massive stars produce more @xmath1 emission via ionizing photons , while intermediate- or low - mass stars ( which have long lifetimes ) mainly contribute uv continuum .",
    "therefore , small galaxies may produce larger ews than massive ones .",
    "in addition , in the larger radius , the traveling time from last scattering to escape can change depending on the position and angle , resulting in the extended and smaller peak of ew .",
    "once the galaxy is ionized , the ionizing photons can escape , and the total recombination rate is fixed . from equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , the intrinsic @xmath1 luminosity then becomes constant , @xmath77 . on the other hand , the uv continuum can continue to increase with the formation of new stars .",
    "thus , upon completion of ionization , the intrinsic @xmath1 luminosity decreases relatively to uv continuum , resulting in a decrease of @xmath1 ew .",
    "after that , however , the ionized region is confined within @xmath56 again due to decreased sfr .",
    "most of @xmath1 photons are trapped within the galaxy by the neutral hydrogen shell .",
    "some of the trapped photons can escape through scattering and random processes , leading to a mild increase of the ew .",
    "however , the uv continuum slowly catches up again with new star formation , bringing down the ew . for galaxies above @xmath78",
    ", there are sharp dips at @xmath79 .",
    "this is the phase transition from complete to partial ionization , i.e. , the gas shell of neutral hydrogen forms again . at the transition ,",
    "@xmath1 photons start to be trapped by the shells , hence the ew decreases steeply . for the galaxy of @xmath80 ,",
    "however , due to the smaller size , the photon traveling time is much smaller than the timestep of simulations , resulting in negligible decrease .",
    "the interplay between @xmath1 and uv continuum photons in the rt processes results in a unique saddle - like shape of the ew as a function of time . to better understand the oscillatory behavior of the ew",
    ", we illustrate in figure  [ fig : idea ] a schematic cartoon of the time evolution of the ionization structure and the escape of @xmath1 photons .",
    "there are four major phases in the evolution which affect the @xmath1 ew significantly :    ( a ) : : :    early phase when the ionized region is confined in the galaxy due to    low sfr and stellar mass .",

    "the previously trapped    @xmath1 photons as well as the new ones    created via recombination of the ionizing photons in the hii regions    escape instantaneously , causing a sudden and strong boost of the ew .",
    "( c ) : : :    with the decline of sfr due to ionization , the number of ionizing    photons is reduced , and the ionized region is confined in the galaxy    again .",
    "the cooled and neutral hydrogen can trap the    @xmath1 photons , leading to a decrease of the    ew .",
    "( d ) : : :    as the stars become older and dimmer , the uv continuum flux decreases .",
    "meanwhile , some of the trapped @xmath1    photons escape after some scatterings .",

    ", the @xmath1 photons are trapped in the galaxy , the @xmath49 approaches to zero in the modeled galaxies . as the",

    "including both the previously trapped and the newly created ones , escape instantaneously , resulting in a drastic , strong peak of the @xmath49 .",
    "after that , the ionized region is confined in the galaxy , the @xmath1 photons are trapped again as in phase ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "but since the @xmath1 photons escape mainly through scattering , the fraction remains nearly constant during these phases , leading to constant luminosity . at the end of the star formation timescale , no more new stars form ,",

    "the evolution of the @xmath1 luminosity does not show the characteristic `` saddle '' shape as the ew .",
    "this is because the @xmath1 luminosity depends only on the ionization structure and the escaping process , it does not depend strongly on the uv continuum as does the ew .",
    "in contrast to the ew , which in general decreases with galaxy mass , the @xmath1 luminosity increases with galaxy mass . this is because both the sfr and the total recombination number are proportional to the galaxy mass , and as a result , the @xmath49 increases linearly with the galaxy mass .",

    "figure  [ fig : profile ] shows the emergent line profiles from the model which takes into account the delayed escape of @xmath1 photons due to the time - dependence of the ionization structure in the galaxy , in comparison with those without photon trapping .    at @xmath89",

    "in contrast , the instantaneous - escaping model predicts a double - peak profile caused by scattering of the neutral shells . at phase ( b )",
    "when the galaxy is completely ionized ( @xmath90 yr ) , the galaxy becomes optically thin .",
    "the line profile without the time dependence shows a narrow profile peaking around @xmath91 , which is the intrinsic profile , while the line from the trapping model shows not only the central peak , but also a significantly extended distribution in both the blue and red wings .",
    "the broadening is caused by the scatterings of the trapped photons before they escape .",
    "then , in phase ( c ) ( @xmath92 yr ) , the galaxy becomes optically thick again , the line profile thus shows double peak owing to scattering , and the luminosity from the trapping model is lower than that from the no - trapping model as expected . in phase ( d ) ( @xmath93 yr ) , with the decline of sfr",
    ", the size of the ionized region becomes small . as a result , the optical depth from the center to the @xmath56 increases , the distance between the peaks in the profile thus increases , resulting in two broad double peaks .",

    "hence , there is no ew peak even at the phase ( b ) in figure  [ fig : idea ] .",
    "the ew simply decreases with sfr as the mean stellar age becomes old . for @xmath99 , there is a ew peak at phase ( b ) . with higher @xmath97 , however , both the sfr and the mass of young stars are higher , leading to an earlier completion of ionization and higher uv continuum flux , which results in smaller ew .",

    "in addition , 3d hydrodynamics and rt calculations would produce more realistic temperature structures .",
    "here , we assume all gas to be @xmath100 k due to efficient radiative cooling .",
    "however , at outer low - density region , some fraction of gas can maintain high temperature near the virial temperature after gravitational shock .",
    "such a detailed history of thermal evolution may change the ionization structure via collisional ionization process , which may lead to different evolution of ew .    in our galaxy model , laes",
    "are constructed as spherical clouds with embedded stars .",
    "if the morphological shape is disky or irregular , supernovae or radiative feedback can produce asymmetric gas ionization and outflow , which would facilitate escaping of ionizing photons .",
    "it was suggested that dense gas shells may still form and efficiently trap photons in the presence of galactic outflows in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",

    "the dust extinction can reduce the ew due to smaller escape fraction of @xmath1 photons .",
    "however , recent observation indicated that the dust extinction of @xmath1 photons might be similar as that of uv continuum .",
    "if this is the case , the resulting ew may not be reduced significantly by the dust . on the other hand ,",
    "imposing a detection threshold may reduce the ew here because we assume the flux is contributed by all @xmath1 photons . in regions with extended @xmath1 emission due to the scattering processes",
