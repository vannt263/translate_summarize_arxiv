    "detailed investigation of geophysical flows involves experimental campaigns in which buoys , in the ocean , or balloons , in the atmosphere , are released in order to collect lagrangian data against which theories and models can be tested .",
    "questions concerning oil spill fate , fish larvae distribution or search and rescue operations are only a few examples that make the study of advection and diffusion properties not only a challenging scientific task , but also a matter of general interest .    in the past years , an amount of lagrangian data about the south atlantic ocean ( sao ) was collected thanks to the first global atmospheric research program ( garp ) global experiment ( fgge ) drifters , released following the major shipping lines , the southern ocean studies ( sos ) drifters , deployed in the brazil - malvinas confluence ( bmc ) and the programa nacional de bias ( pnboia ) drifters [ brazilian contribution to the global oceans observing system ( goos ) ] , released in the southeastern brazilian bight ( sbb ) .",
    "these data allowed estimates of eddy kinetic energy ( eke ) , integral time scales and diffusivities ( piola et al .",
    "1987 ; figueroa and olson 1989 ; schfer and krauss 1995 ) . despite the relatively uniform coverage , the boundary currents resulted poorly populated by buoys ; furthermore , all previous studies about drifters in the south atlantic have concerned one - particle statistics only . in this regard , in the framework of monitoring by ocean drifters ( mondo ) project , a recent lagrangian experiment , consisting in the release of a set of 39 world ocean circulation experiment ( woce ) surface velocity program ( svp ) drifters , was planned in relationship with an oil drilling operation in proximity of the coast of brazil , around ( @xmath1s , @xmath2w ) .",
    "part of the drifters were deployed in 5-element clusters , some of them with initial drifter separations smaller than 1 km .",
    "this set of satellite - tracked lagrangian trajectories offers , now , the opportunity to revisit advective and diffusive properties characterizing the current systems explored by the drifters . from the analysis of trajectory pair dispersion",
    "we can extract , in principle , information about the dominant physical mechanism acting at a certain scale of motion ( e.g. chaotic advection , turbulence , diffusion ) . a thorough description of the oceanography of the south atlantic ocean , particularly of the main circulation patterns and of the mass transport properties , can be found in peterson and stramma ( 1991 ) ; campos et al .",

    "the major feature characterizing the central region of the sao is the large anticyclonic ( anticlockwise ) circulation known as subtropical gyre ( sg ) .",
    "other relevant surface current systems are : south equatorial current ( sec ) , brazil current ( bc ) , malvinas current ( mc ) , south atlantic current ( sac ) and benguela current ( bgc ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sao ] .            in the quasigeostrophic ( qg ) approximation ,",
    "valid for relative vorticities much smaller than the ambient vorticity because of the earth s rotation , some theoretical arguments would predict that , from the scale of the forcing at which eddies are efficiently generated by instability , e.g. the rossby radius of deformation , both a down - scale enstrophy cascade and an up - scale energy cascade take place , corresponding to energy spectra @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ( kraichnan 1967 ; charney 1971 ) . from a relative dispersion perspective , in the forward cascade range , the mean square relative displacement between two trajectories grows exponentially fast in time ( lin 1972 ) , whereas , in the inverse cascade range , it follows the @xmath5 power law ( obhukov 1941 ; batchelor 1950 ) .",
    "possible deviations from this ideal picture may reasonably come from the non homogeneous and non stationary characteristics of the velocity field : for example , in the case of boundary currents , as well as from ageostrophic effects . at this regard ,",
    "one presently debated issue is the role of submesoscale vortices ( mcwilliams 1985 ) [ velocity field features of size @xmath0 km ] in determining the shape of the energy spectrum at intermediate scales between the rossby deformation radius [ in the ocean typically @xmath6 km ] and the dissipative scales ( much smaller than 1 km ) .",
    "a thorough discussion about submesoscale processes and dynamics can be found in thomas et al .",

    "our main purpose is to exploit the mondo drifter trajectories , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : drifters ] , to examine relative dispersion by means of several indicators , and discuss the consistency of our data analysis in comparison with classical turbulence theory predictions , model simulations and previous drifter studies available for different regions of the ocean .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : diffusion ] we recall the definitions of the major indicators of the lagrangian dispersion process ; in section [ sec : data ] we give a description of the mondo drifter lagrangian data ; in section [ sec : results ] the outcome of the data analysis is presented ; in section [ sec : model ] , we report the analysis of the ocean model lagrangian simulations in comparison with the observative data ; and , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we outline and discuss the main results we have obtained in the present work .",
    "let @xmath15 be the position vector of a lagrangian particle , in a 3d space , evolving according to the equation @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a 3d eulerian velocity field , and let us indicate with @xmath18 the lagrangian velocity along the trajectory @xmath19 .",
    "let us imagine , then , a large ensemble of @xmath20 lagrangian particles , passively advected by the given velocity field , and refer , for every statistically averaged quantity , to the mean over the ensemble .",
    "the autocorrelation function of a lagrangian velocity component @xmath21 can be defined , for @xmath22 , as : @xmath23 / \\left [ \\langle v(t_0)^2 \\rangle - \\langle v(t_0 ) \\rangle^2 \\right ]    \\label{eq : autocorr}\\ ] ] in case of stationary statistics , @xmath24 depends only on the time lag @xmath25 .",
    "the integral lagrangian time @xmath26 is the time scale after which the autocorrelation has nearly relaxed to zero .",
    "typically @xmath26 can be estimated as the time of the first zero crossing of @xmath24 , or , alternatively , as the time after which @xmath27 remains smaller than a given threshold .",
    "absolute dispersion can be defined as the variance of the particle displacement relatively to the mean position at time @xmath28 : @xmath29 ^ 2 \\rangle - \\langle \\left [ \\mathbf{r}(t)-\\mathbf{r}(0 ) \\right ]   \\rangle^2     \\label{eq : absdisp}\\ ] ] in the limit of very small times , absolute dispersion is expected to behave as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath26 is the lagrangian autocorrelation time and @xmath31 is the total lagrangian velocity variance .",
    "the ballistic regime ( [ eq : ballistic ] ) lasts as long as the trajectories save some memory of their initial conditions . in the opposite limit of very large times ,",
    "when the autocorrelations have relaxed to zero and the memory of the initial conditions is lost , we have : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the absolute diffusion coefficient  ( taylor 1921 ) .    although single particle statistics give information about the advective transport , mostly because of the largest and most energetic scales of motion , two ( or more ) particle statistics give information about the physical mechanisms acting at any scale of motion , compatibly with the available resolution .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath34 the distance between two trajectories at time @xmath28 .",
    "relative dispersion is defined as the second order moment of @xmath35 : @xmath36 where the average is over all the available trajectory pairs @xmath37 .    in the small scale range , the velocity field between two sufficiently close trajectories",
    "is reasonably assumed to vary smoothly .",
    "this means that , in nonlinear flows , the particle pair separation typically evolves following an exponential law : @xmath38 where , from the theory of dynamical systems , @xmath39 is the generalized lyapunov exponent of order 2 ( bohr et al .",
    "1998 ) . when fluctuations of the finite - time exponential growth rate around its mean value are weak , one has @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the ( lagrangian ) maximum lyapunov exponent ( mle ; boffetta et al .",
    "notice that for ergodic trajectory evolutions the lyapunov exponents do not depend on the initial conditions .",
    "if @xmath42 ( except for a set of zero probability measure ) we speak of lagrangian chaos . the chaotic regime holds as long as the trajectory separation remains sufficiently smaller than the characteristic scales of motion .    in the opposite limit of large particle separations , when two trajectories are sufficiently distant from each other to be considered uncorrelated , the mean square relative displacement behaves as : @xmath43 where we indicate with @xmath44 the asymptotic eddy - diffusion coefficient ( richardson 1926 ) .    at any time @xmath28",
    ", the diffusivity @xmath45 can be defined as : @xmath46 with @xmath47 for @xmath48 .    if the velocity field is characterized by several scales of motion , relative dispersion in the intermediate range , i.e. between the smallest and the largest characteristic length , depends on the properties of local velocity differences , i.e. the mean gradients on finite scale .",
    "for instance , in 3d fully developed turbulence ( frisch 1995 ) , relative dispersion follows the so - called richardson s law : @xmath49 with @xmath50 , as long as the trajectory separation lies in the inertial range of the energy cascade  ( richardson 1926 ) from large to small scales .",
    "it is worth to remark that richardson s law also holds in the inverse cascade range ( from small to large scales ) of 2d turbulence because , in that case as well , the energy spectrum follows kolmogorov s @xmath51 scaling , exactly as in the inertial range of 3d turbulence ( kraichnan 1967 ) .",
    "any power law of the type ( [ eq : richardson ] ) for @xmath52 with @xmath53 is known as super - diffusion .",
    "the finite - scale lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) has been formerly introduced as the generalization of the mle @xmath54 for non - infinitesimal perturbations  ( aurell et al .",
    "if @xmath55 is the size of the perturbation on a trajectory in the phase space of a system , and @xmath56 is the phase space averaged time that @xmath55 takes to be amplified by a factor @xmath57 , then the fsle is defined as @xmath58 the quantity @xmath59 is the exit time of the perturbation size from the scale @xmath55 , and it is defined as the first arrival time to the scale @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "the computation of the expectation value of the growth rate at a fixed scale , which justifies the definition ( [ eq : fsle ] ) , is described in  boffetta et al .",
    "as far as lagrangian dynamics are concerned , the evolution equations of the lagrangian trajectories form a dynamical system whose phase space is the physical space spanned by the trajectories . in this context , the analysis of relative dispersion can be treated as a problem of finite - size perturbation evolution , with scale - dependent growth rate measured by the fsle .",
    "the first who had the idea to measure the relative dispersion , or , equivalently , the diffusivity , as a function of the trajectory separation was richardson ( 1926 ) .",
    "the fsle is fundamentally based on the same principle .",
    "recently , the use of fixed - time and fixed - scale averaged indicators of relative dispersion in various contexts , from dynamical systems to observative data in ocean and atmosphere , have been reviewed and discussed in several works ( artale et al .",
    "1997 ; boffetta et al . 2000",
    "; lacorata et al . 2001 , 2004 ; lacasce and ohlmann 2003 , lacasce 2008 ) . by a dimensional argument ,",
    "if relative dispersion follows a @xmath62 scaling law , then the fsle is expected to scale as @xmath63 .",
    "for example , in the case of standard diffusion we expect @xmath64 ; in richardson s super - diffusion , @xmath65 ; in ballistic or shear dispersion we have @xmath66 .",
    "chaotic advection means exponential separation between trajectories . in terms of fsle",
    "this amounts to a scale - independent @xmath67constant : that is , @xmath68 . in the limit of infinitesimal separation ,",
    "the fsle is nothing but the mle , i.e. @xmath69 ( aurell et al . 1996 ) . under these conditions ,",
    "relative dispersion is said to be a non - local process , since it is determined by velocity field structures with a characteristic scale much larger than the particle separation .",
    "on the contrary , when the growth of the distance between two particles is mainly driven by velocity field structures of the same scale as the particle separation , relative dispersion is said to be a local process .",
    "the super - diffusive processes occurring in 2d and 3d turbulence are phenomena of this type .",
    "an indicator related to the fsle is the mean square velocity difference between two trajectories as function of their separation .",
    "indicating with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 the positions and the lagrangian velocities , respectively , of two particles @xmath74 and @xmath75 at a given time , we define the finite - scale relative velocity ( fsrv ) at scale @xmath55 : @xmath76 ^ 2 \\rangle = \\langle   \\left [   { \\mathbf v}^{(1 ) } -   { \\mathbf v}^{(2 ) } \\right]^2   \\rangle     \\label{eq : fsrv}\\ ] ] where the average is over all trajectory pairs fulfilling the condition @xmath77 at some time @xmath28 . from the fsrv",
    "a scale - dependent diffusivity can be formed as @xmath78 ^ 2 \\rangle^{1/2}$ ] and compared to the classical time - dependent diffusivity @xmath45 defined in ( [ eq : diffusivity ] ) .",
    "we would like to end this section with a remark .",
    "it is physically reasonable to assume that , for statistically homogeneous flows , the behavior of the relative dispersion changes in correspondence of certain characteristic lengths of the system , rather than after certain time intervals . the major shortcoming when measuring the mean square relative displacement at fixed time consists in averaging together particle pairs that may have very different separations , i.e. may belong to very different dispersion regimes . on the contrary , the mean dispersion rate at fixed scale , or other scale - dependent related quantities ,",
    "generally have the benefit of being weakly affected by possible overlap effects .",
    "this is of particular relevance since the presence of scaling laws in the pre - asymptotic regime raises questions about the characteristics ( e.g. , the kinetic energy spectrum ) of the underlying velocity field .",
    "the mondo project is a campaign planned by prooceano for eni oil do brasil to provide unrestricted access to oceanographic data and subsidize not only the companies operational goals but also the scientific community .",
    "the lagrangian experiment consisted in the deployment of 39 woce svp drifters ( sybrandy and niiler 1991 ) in the surroundings of an oil drilling operation ( @xmath1 24 50 `` s and @xmath79 46 22 '' w ) in proximity of the bc .",
    "the drifters are of the holey - sock type , composed by a surface floater , a tether and a submerged drogue , following the design criteria proposed by sybrandy and niiler ( 1991 ) .",
    "the drogue length is 6.44 m , centered at 15 m deep , in order to represent the first 20 m current information .",
    "the drifters are equipped with a gps device and iridium transmission , providing a positioning accuracy of 7 meters and an acquiring rate of 3 hours . from the 39 drifters ,",
    "14 were deployed individually in a 3-day frequency and 25 were deployed in clusters of 5 , every 12 days .",
    "justification for the 3-day frequency deployment is based upon the 6.5 days energy peak in the wind variability in the region ( stech and lorenzetti 1992 ) .",
    "data used in this study comprehend the period within 21 september 2007 - 14 november 2008 and passed the quality control proposed by hansen and poulain ( 1996 ) in the global drifter program ( gdp ) database .",
    "high frequency components have been removed by applying a blackman low - pass filter with a window of 15 points ( 45 hours ) .",
    "the domain explored by the mondo project drifters mainly corresponds to that of the bc and to the area where the southward flowing bc meets the northward flowing mc , forming the bmc , which results in an eastward current feeding the sac .",
    "bc is a warm western boundary current , flowing southward and meandering over the 200 m isobath ( peterson and stramma 1991 ; lima et al .",
    "as reported by de castro ( 2006 ) and garfield ( 1990 ) the velocities inside the bc have values between 25 and 80 @xmath80 . bc flux increases with latitude ( assireu 2003 ; mller et al .",

    "lagrangian dispersion properties of drifters launched in the southwestern corner of the south atlantic subtropical gyre have been analyzed through the computation of time - dependent and scale - dependent indicators .",

    "anisotropy of the flow is reflected in the different behavior of the zonal and meridional components of the absolute dispersion .",
    "being the mondo drifters advected mostly by the boundary currents surrounding the subtropical gyre , the brazil current first and the south atlantic current later , the meridional component of the absolute dispersion is dominant as long as the mean drifter direction is nearly southward ( bc ) , while the zonal component dominates ( see the appearance of the late ballistic regime ) as the mean drifter direction is nearly eastward ( sac ) .",
    "early time advection is modulated , also , by the response of the currents to a wind forcing of period @xmath182  days , a characteristic meteorological feature of the bc dynamics .",

    "classic indicators like the mean square relative displacement and the relative diffusivities between two drifters as functions of the time lag from the release give loose information about early phase exponential separation , characterized by a mean rate @xmath104  day@xmath91 , and long time dispersion approximated , to some extent , by richardson super - diffusion before the cut - off due to the finite lifetime of the trajectories .",
    "evidence of a small scale exponential regime for relative dispersion is common to other drifter studies for different ocean regions ( lacasce and ohlmann 2003 ; ollitrault et al .",
    "2005 , koszalka et al .",
    "2009 , lumpkin and elipot 2010 ) .",
    "scale - dependent indicators return back a cleaner picture , compatibly with the limited statistics allowed by the experimental data and the non homogeneous and non stationary characteristics of the flow .",
    "the fsle displays a mesoscale [ @xmath183  km ] regime compatible with richardson super - diffusion , lagrangian counterpart of the 2d inverse cascade scenario characterized by a @xmath51 energy spectrum . at scales smaller than 100 km",
    "the fsle has a step - like shape , with a first plateau at level @xmath184  day@xmath91 in the submesoscale range @xmath0 km , and a second plateau at level @xmath123  day@xmath91 for scales comparable with the rossby radius of deformation ( @xmath117 km ) .",
    "constant fsle in a range of scales corresponds to exponential separation .",
    "the @xmath124 plateau could be related to the 2d direct cascade characterized by a @xmath7 energy spectrum , while the origin of the @xmath0 km plateau is likely related to the existence of submesoscale features of the velocity field , the role of which has been recently assessed by means of high - resolution 3d simulations of upper ocean turbulence at rossby numbers @xmath185 ( capet et al . 2008a , b ; klein et al .",
    "the fsle does not display a clean continuous cascade scaling @xmath126 , corresponding to a @xmath8 energy spectrum , from sub to mesoscales ; however , it highlights the existence of scales of motion hardly reconcilable with the qg turbulence scenario , as analogously assessed also by lumpkin and elipot ( 2010 ) for drifter dispersion in the north atlantic .",
    "the fsrv measures the mean square velocity difference at scale @xmath55 .",
    "the scaling of the fsrv is related to the turbulent characteristics of relative dispersion .",
    "the fsrv behavior is , under a certain point of view , cleaner than that of the fsle , but it is affected by the presence of two `` valleys '' , roughly at @xmath186 km and at @xmath187 km , likely associated to trapping events ( the same features are present also in the fsle behavior ) .",
    "coherent structures on scales @xmath162 and @xmath188  km may be responsible of the `` fall '' in the relative dispersion rate .",
    "these scales are of the order of the rossby radius and of the mesoscale rings that detach from the current systems , respectively .",
    "we must also consider the role of the brazil - malvinas confluence which tends to inhibit the growth of the dispersion as the drifters , initially flowing southwestward along the brazil current , encounter the northeastward flowing malvinas current before being , eventually , transported eastward along the south atlantic current .",
    "the fsrv displays a mesoscale @xmath189 scaling ( except for the `` valley '' ) , compatible with a @xmath51 inverse cascade ; a @xmath190 scaling in the two subranges @xmath6  km and @xmath132  km , which correspond to the step - like shape of the fsle ; a @xmath191 scaling which , to some extent , is compatible with a @xmath8 regime connecting scales of the order of the rossby radius to the submesoscale ( below which the velocity field becomes approximately smooth ) .",
    "the equivalent lagrangian spectrum @xmath137 , formed by dividing the fsrv ( essentially the relative kinetic energy at scale @xmath55 ) by the wavenumber @xmath192 , returns back the same scenario in @xmath136 space .",
    "last , we have compared the scale - dependent relative diffusivity @xmath141 constructed from the fsrv , for which @xmath55 is the independent variable , with the classic relative diffusivity @xmath45 seen as a function of the mean separation between two drifters @xmath193 , for which @xmath28 is the independent variable .",
    "what emerges from the analysis of the diffusivities is that , in the mesoscale range , loosely from the rossby radius up to scales @xmath129  km , @xmath194 , corresponding to the @xmath51 inverse cascade ; in the submesoscale range @xmath132  km , and in a limited subrange from about the rossby radius down to @xmath162  km , @xmath195 , corresponding to exponential separation ; in the subrange @xmath133  km , the scaling @xmath196 is compatible with a @xmath8 regime .",
    "the @xmath8 spectrum is a characteristic of upper ocean turbulence when the rossby number is order @xmath0 , as recently assessed with high - resolution 3d model simulations ( capet et al .",
    "2008a , b ; klein et al . 2008 ) , which connects the mesoscale to the submesoscale @xmath197 km ( mcwilliams 1985 ) .",
    "below the submesoscale the velocity field is reasonably assumed to vary smoothly",
    ". a rough estimate of the rossby number associated to the mondo drifter dynamics gives a value ( at least ) @xmath198 , taking @xmath199 m / s , @xmath200 km and @xmath201 1/s , which is , nonetheless , considerably larger than the typical rossby number in open ocean .",
    "although the drifter data analysis does not show a clear evidence of a relative dispersion regime corresponding to the @xmath8 spectrum , the presence of velocity field features of size comparable to submesoscale vortices is reflected , to some extent , by the behavior of the small scale relative dispersion process .",
    "numerical simulations of the lagrangian dynamics have been performed with an ogcm of the south atlantic ( huntley et al .",
    "the results concerning the relative dispersion essentially agree with the data analysis of the mondo drifters , within the limits of the available numerical resolution .",
    "in particular , two - particle statistical indicators such as the fsle , the fsrv and the scale - dependent relative diffusivity @xmath141 , computed on the trajectories of virtual drifters , display the same behaviour found for mondo drifters for scales larger than approximatley @xmath92  km , that is larger than the numerical grid spacing .",
    "below this length scale , evidently , the model flow field is smooth , hence relevant departures from qg turbulence and the role of submesoscale structures can not be assessed .",
    "further investigations on the modeling of submesoscale processes would provide extremely useful in order to make a clearer picture of the small scale dynamics of the surface ocean circulation in the region .",
