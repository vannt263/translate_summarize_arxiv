    "<S> one expects to find the two higher frequency modes to be present , since only the rocking and wagging librations are ir active . </S>",
    "<S> the twisting libration , consisting of a rotation of the hydrogen atoms around the c2 axis , is not ir active since it does not affect the dipole moment of the molecule . </S>",
