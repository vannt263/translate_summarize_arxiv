    "late - time tails in black hole spacetimes have been studied extensively since price s seminal analysis @xcite .",
    "complete understanding is available for the schwarzschild spacetime  where it was also found in fully nonlinear numerical simulations @xcite  and much progress has been made recently also in understanding the tail problem for kerr black holes @xcite , and even for spacetimes without any assumption of symmetry ( but with a globally weak field ) @xcite .",
    "the tail of spherically - symmetric , electrically - charged , static black holes  namely reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes  was studied first by bik for the case of scalar perturbations ( for both the non - extreme and extreme cases ) in @xcite and for the case of coupled electromagnetic and gravitational ( linearized ) perturbation in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and revisited by gundlach , price , and pullin ( gpp ) @xcite .",
    "price s law has been proved rigorously in the schwarzaschild case and a self - gravitating scalar field by dafermos and rodnianski @xcite .",
    "the late - time tails in black hole spacetimes are understood as a result of the asymptotic form of the effective potential at great distances from the black hole , and the exponential drop off of the potential close to the event horizon .",
    "it is the scattering of the waves off the effective potential at great distances that is responsible for the creation of the tails .",
    "( this picture applies also for the case of a kerr spacetime , but this simple behavior is masked by an intricate mode coupling effect .",
    "see @xcite . )",
    "indeed , it was implied first by bik in ref .",
    "@xcite and then argued explicitly in greater detail by gpp in ref .",
    "@xcite that because in rn the effective potential has the same form at great distances as in schwarzschild , the decay rate of the tails in rn must be the same as in schwarzschild .",
    "it was further demonstrated numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite that this is indeed the case .",
    "( this argument is further reinforced by the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the gpp argument suggests that all spacetimes that share the same asymptotic form of the effective potential , have the same decay rate for the late - time tails .",
    "the possible exception of the late - time tails in the extreme rn ( ern ) spacetime is therefore intriguing . specifically , bik argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the exponent of the tails ( as observed in a fixed observation point ) in the ern spacetime for initial data with an initial static moment @xmath0 was @xmath1 , whereas in schwarzschild and ( non - extreme ) rn it is @xmath2 .",
    "the asymptotic form of the effective potential is the same in those three spacetimes .",
    "( they differ only to @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the tortoise coordinate . to @xmath5 the three effective potentials are identical ) .",
    "applied naively , the gpp argument suggests that the same exponent for the tails should be observed for all three cases .    however , it turns out that the effective potential in ern is very different from the effective potentials in schwarzschild or ( non - extreme ) rn near the black hole : instead of dropping off exponentially ( in @xmath4 , for large and negative values of @xmath4 ) towards the event horizon , the effective potential in ern is effectively centrifugal asymptotically close to the event horizon .",
    "moreover , the deviations from centrifugality have the same leading - order form as the deviations from centrifugality at great distances from the event horizon ( large and positive @xmath4 ) .",
    "that is , the effective potential is asymptotically symmetric @xcite , such that the tails at @xmath6 are expected to have contributions both from scatterings at great distances , and from scatterings very close to the event horizon .",
    "( in that sense , the event horizon is equivalent to future null infinity .",
    "in fact , the close analogy of the event horizon to future null infinity is even deeper : the tail along the event horizon of ern turns out to be the same as along future null infinity ( see below ) . )",
    "can the contributions to the tails coming from the close vicinity of the event horizon in ern overwhelm the contributions to the tails coming from great distances , or interfere with them to create tails with the indices predicted in @xcite ? in this paper",
    "we study this issue , and show that with adaptations , the gpp argument is applicable also to the ern spacetime . we then present also numerical simulations of tails in ern .",
    "these simulations indicate that the fall - off of these tails in the ern case is the same as in the non - extreme case , i.e. , quicker than that predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec_pot ] we describe the scattering problem , and discuss the asymptotic symmetry of the effective potential .",
    "this symmetry was found in @xcite , and is presented here for completeness . in section [ secondary_waves ]",
    "we argue that in both schwarzschild and ern the tails along @xmath6 result from the secondary waves ( first scattering ) . tertiary waves ( second scattering ) or higher - order waves that are present at late times originate only from scatterings at small values of @xmath7 ; scattering at great distances leads only to secondary waves .",
    "as it is the scattering at great distances which leads to the tails , we argue that it is the secondary waves which are responsible to the tails . in section [ com ]",
    "we discuss the tails in ern when the initial data have compact support .",
    "we argue that the tail problem along @xmath6 in ern is dual to a tail problem in schwarzschild ( for a different , but related , initial value problem ) ; as the latter is well understood , we may predict the power - law indices for ern tails .",
    "the meaning of duality here is as follows : while the value of the field at a particular event is different in the two spacetimes ( because the intermediate effective potentials of the two dual spacetimes are not identical ) , the scattering dynamics from regions of spacetime that contribute to the formation of the tail is similar , so that the same power - law indices for the tail are expected .",
    "we emphasize that the duality argument pertains only to the tail at a fixed observation point ( along @xmath6 ) .",
    "then , in section [ ism ] we consider the tails in ern with an initially static moment for the initial data .",
    "we again show that this problem is dual to another tail problem in schwarzschild , and use this duality to find the decay rate of the tails in ern .",

    "two spacetimes ( fixed background geometry and an intial data set for linearized perturbations ) are said to be _ dual _ if the asymptotic contributions of secondary waves to the late - time tails in the two spacetimes ( at a fixed observation point ) have the same decay rate .",
    "consider an ern spacetime , with initial data of compact support .",

    "( it is important that we discuss only secondary waves .",
    "if higher - order waves were allowed , then there would be no clear separation of waves coming from the right and waves coming from the left , as the two would be coupled in an intricate manner . )    next , consider the case of ern with the waves coming from the right .",
    "we argue that the ( partial ) tails in this case are the same as the tails in schwarzschild for the same initial data , because at great distances the effective potential in schwarzschild is the same as in ern .",
    "[ deviations are only at @xmath3 . ] therefore , we can replace the first diagram on the right hand side of the top row of fig .",
    "[ ern1 ] with the first diagram on the second row .",
    "similarly , the ( partial ) tails coming from the left in ern ( second diagram on right hand side of the top row ) are the same as the tails in schwarzschild , if we reflect the initial data to the other side of the potential barrier , and change the initial data to be initially incoming ( second diagram on the second row ) .",
    "this is the case because the effective potential in ern close to the event horizon is the same as the effective potential in ern at great distances , and the latter in its turn is the same as the effective potential at great distances in schwarzschild .",
    "consequently , the ern effective potential close to the event horizon is asymptotically the same as the effective potential at great distances in schwarzschild .",

    "( the wave propagation is strictly speaking not the same in these three spacetimes , because the effective potentials at finite distances are not identical .",
    "however , the tails are generated only by the asymptotic parts of the curvature potential , and these are the same in these three spacetimes . )",
    "the original tail problem in ern is then dual to the suporposition of two schwarzschild problems , which , because of the linearity of the problem , we can recombine into a single problem by adding together the original initial data and the reflected initial data .",
    "there is one more subtle point , though : the tails we obtained are not the full tails , because in the recombined diagrams we only have waves coming from the right , whereas in the full picture in schwarzschild we would have waves coming both from the right and from the left . adding the waves in schwarschild which come from the left ,",
    "we argue , would not change the tails . allowing for waves coming from the left in schwarzschild would add only negligible amount of secondary waves , because in schwarzschild the effective potential drops off exponentially near the event horizon .",
    "in addition , because the original pulse has compact support , there will be no primary waves coming from the left at late times .",
    "therefore , we argue that we can add to our diagram also the waves coming form the left in schwarzschild , because they will not change the tails . this way , we obtain the last diagram in fig .",
    "[ ern1 ] ( third row ) , which is the full diagram for a tail problem in schwarzschild for initial data different from the original one ( the original initial data superposed with their reflection ) . as the tail problem in schwarzschild is completely understood ( the exponent of the tails is @xmath116 ) , we argue that the same exponent for the tails is expected also in ern .",
    "below , in section [ num ] , we show , using numerical simulations , that this is indeed the case .",
    "the arguments in this case follow closely those of the preceding section , and will therefore be described here briefly . for initial data with an  initially static moment \" ( i.e. , a multipole moment of the static solution is present on the initial data hypersurface ) , for schwarschild @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the legendre function of the second kind , while for ern @xcite @xmath119 and @xmath120 recall that the form of the initial data with an initially static moment is important only for @xmath59 .",

    "remarkably , the initially static moment initial data are the same for ern as they are for schwarzschild for @xmath50 .",
    "we may therefore take the initial data in ern to be @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
