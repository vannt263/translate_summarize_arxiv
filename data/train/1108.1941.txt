    "the dynamics of many complex systems proceed via sequences of infrequent transition events from one metastable state to another .",
    "well - known examples include chemical reactions , conformation changes of bio - molecules , nucleation events during phase transition , etc.@xmath2 metastability is characterized by the appearance of disparate time scales .",
    "two most important time scales are the relaxation time scale of a state , and the transition time out of the state .",
    "a state is metastable if the second time scale is much bigger than the first .",
    "for this reason , transitions between different metastable states are rare events .",
    "if the system has a rather simple potential energy landscape ( pes ) , the bottleneck for the transition is a saddle point ( generally of index-1 ) , called the transition state , of the potential energy of the system .",
    "crippen and scheraga pioneered numerical algorithms for climbing out of basins of attraction.@xmath3 in their method , starting from an initial point @xmath4 , in the @xmath5-th step , the system translates along the direction @xmath6 by a suitable step length @xmath7 to yield @xmath8 .",
    "this is followed by minimization on a hyperplane @xmath9 perpendicular to @xmath10 to yield @xmath11 .",
    "this process is repeated until the system reaches a saddle point . to sample different saddle points",
    ", the authors suggested using the eigenvectors @xmath12 of the hessian at @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath14 $ ] , followed by minimization on @xmath15 to obtain @xmath16 .",
    "later works on exploring the high dimensional potential energy surface ( pes ) are based on the realization that evaluating minimum eigenmode of the hessian is central to the convergence to an index-1 saddle point .",
    "the system can however , start from the initial locally stable point by following any eigenmode of the hessian or other randomly selected direction vectors.@xmath17 for smaller systems , an eigenvalue problem of the hessian is easy to solve by diagonalization ( though one has to remove the global rotational and translational components ) , but this becomes computationally challenging for systems of higher dimensions . consequently , many techniques have been proposed to evaluate the minimum eigenmode of the hessian in an optimal fashion .",
    "for instance , cerjan and miller suggested a technique that requires selecting a trust region around a point on the multidimensional pes and approximating the energy of the system within this trust region by a quadratic expression.@xmath18 an optimal direction to translate the system is then determined by evaluating the extremum of the energy on the boundary of the trust region .",
    "the key to proper evaluation of the optimal direction lies on proper selection of the trust region - if the trust region too small , then the linear term dominates and only one minimum is obtained ; on the other hand , for a large trust region the quadratic approximation of the pes becomes poor .",
    "the computational effort , for this method , scales up rapidly as more degrees of freedom are included in the system and at the same time the construction of the hessian can become a formidable computation challenge when analytical second derivatives are not available .    a more economic approach to evaluate the ascent direction , that avoids the constructing the full hessian , is the dimer method proposed by henkelman and j@xmath19nsson.@xmath20 a dimer consists of two images of the configuration separated by a small distance ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) .",
    "the dimer translates towards a saddle point by the modified force @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the net force acting on the dimer and @xmath25 is the component of the force parallel to a dimer direction @xmath26 .",

    "the above , @xmath29 and @xmath30 represents the energy of the dimer separated by a distance of @xmath31 . the process of obtaining the minimum eigenmode of the hessian is implemented by first selecting a suitable plane spanned by the rotational force acting on the dimer and the direction @xmath26 .",
    "the dimer is then rotated in this plane to obtain an optimal @xmath26 corresponding to a minimum energy of the dimer.@xmath32 a dynamical version of the dimer method was recently proposed by poddey et al.@xmath33    similarly , munro and wales suggested an iterative scheme to calculate the minimum eigen mode of the hessian.@xmath34 starting from an initial guess direction @xmath35 , the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the hessian is found approximately by successive operation of the shifted hessian i.e. @xmath36 , where , @xmath37 is a constant and @xmath38 is the identity matrix . in this procedure , since we only need the product of the hessian with a vector , there is no need to explicitly calculate the hessian thus reducing the computational complexity significantly .",
    "once the minimum eigenmode is determined the system is then translated in the configuration space by a suitable step length .",
    "other pes exploration algorithms like the activation - relaxation method ( art ) proposed by barkema and mousseau@xmath39 do not guarantee visiting an index-1 saddle point .",
    "analysis of the convergence of art to saddle points is detailed in the appendix .",
    "even though art is an excellent exploration tool , the saddle points sampled may not correspond to the low barrier saddle points that drive rare transition events .",
    "proposals for fixing this problem can be found in recent literature.@xmath40    the philosophy that underlies the gentlest ascent dynamics ( gad ) is to take one step back and formulate a set of dynamic equations whose solutions converge to saddle points .",
    "numerical algorithms can then be constructed by discretizing this set of dynamic equations . as we illustrate in this paper ,",
    "having a set of dynamical equations helps us to analyze the stability and convergence close to different fixed points on the pes . at the same time",
    ", it is easy to extend such a formalism to finite temperature cases . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss how gad can be naturally extended as a tool for sampling saddle points and for the exploration of the configuration space .",
    "in particular , we will propose finite temperature molecular dynamics version of gad , md - gad .",

    "such time series can be useful for a variety of purposes .",

    "the arrangement of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we discuss the set of dynamical equations corresponding to finite temperature and zero temperature conditions to sample saddle points . in section iii , we discuss the different ways to implement the set of dynamical equations , namely , identifying an important region associated with a rare transition event , proper sampling of direction to move out of the energy well and selection of convergence criteria .",

    "described earlier we use @xmath124 = 1 , 2 , 4 , 12 , though one can resort to a different set of values .",
    "our choice of selectively activating only a few components of the direction vector stems from the fact that even though physical processes , such as different deformation mechanisms , taking place in most materials have activation volumes in the range of 0.1@xmath129 - 1000@xmath129 , @xmath130 is the burgers vector of the system , the size of the nucleus in the initial stages can be quite small .",

    "one might resort to a smaller time step .",
    "however , this is not conducive as the majority of initialized direction vectors have sufficient time to relax to the minimum eigenmode much before the system reaches the separatrix .",

    "our use of a criteria based on equilibrium bond length of atoms in a system to identify the closeness of a system from the initial local minimum point also saves computational cost .",
    "the finite temperature versions of gad open avenues for sampling of saddle points on the pes .",
    "generally existing macroscopic models are based on information obtained from locally stable fixed points of a system . in the stochastic version of gad ,",
    "since the system can hop between different low energy saddle points , a wealth of information can be obtain about the saddle configurations .",
    "this information can then be used to improve the existing mean field models .",
    "gad can be extended to handle higher index saddle points , as was done in ref[15 ] .",
    "it is obvious that one can also extend the work presented to those cases .",
    "our results for point defect activity on a @xmath1 surface obtained from gad show a variety of processes involving more than a single atom .",
    "indeed the wide spectrum of diffusion processes revealed by gad for ad - atoms , vacancies and islands can provide much needed insight into the probable mechanisms behind many experimentally observed surface phenomena.@xmath178",
    "the fixed points of pes are also the fixed points of ( @xmath70 ) . to see this consider a two dimensional system with force @xmath179 and direction vector @xmath180 , where @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , @xmath184 are individual components of force and direction vectors , respectively , along the @xmath114 and @xmath185 axis .",
    "consequently , the solutions of @xmath186 are : @xmath187 equating the individual vector components on both sides of the above equation we obtain @xmath188 which is possible only if individual components of the force vector are zero .",

    "let @xmath198 be the eigenvalues ( including degeneracies ) of @xmath199 and @xmath200 be the associated set of orthonormal eigenvectors at some fixed point of @xmath192 .",
