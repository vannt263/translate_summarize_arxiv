    "the collision integral depends crucially on the phase - space distribution function @xmath0 .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to apply the quantum wigner phase - space distribution function , also known as the wigner transform @xcite , to the evaluation of the collision integral in a finite fermi system .",
    "the wigner distribution function ( wdf ) is defined as the fourier transform of the one - body density matrix over the relative coordinates .",

    "the wdf is useful in providing a reformulation of quantum machanics in terms of classical concepts @xcite and a good starting point for semiclassical approximations @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the equilibrium phase space density distribution function @xmath1 in the collision integral is replaced by the one , @xmath2 , taken in thomas - fermi approximation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the step function and @xmath5 is the classical single - particle energy .",

    "both these features are due to particle reflections on potential walls .",
    "the diffusivity of the fermi surface in momentum space increases in the vicinity of the nuclear surface @xcite and thus enhances the effective particle scattering there because of the decrease of the pauli blocking effect .",

    "however , there is a conceptual disadvantage for the application of the fermi distribution function @xmath11 with @xmath12 to the collision integral .",
    "namely , with this function the gain and loss terms in the collision integral are each nonzero for the ground state of the system , where the probability current should be absent by definition .",
    "we show in this work that in order to overcome this difficulty the smooth quantum distribution function @xmath13 should be used for @xmath1 in the collision integral in the kinetic landau - vlasov equation .",
    "in contrast to the fermi distribution function @xmath11 , the smooth quantum distribution function @xmath13 contains the residual oscillations @xcite ensuring the above - mentioned condition for the disappearance of the gain and loss terms in the collision integral for the ground state and reducing the internal collisional width of the giant multipole resonances .",
    "in this paper we pay attention mainly to finite size and memory effects in the relaxation processes in finite fermi systems .",

    "the final result ( solid line 1 ) agrees with above calculation of the collisional width in the ho potential ; see the dashed line in fig .",

    "it was shown that the general condition for the disappearance of the gain and loss probability fluxes in the ground state of system can be reached due to the occurrence of quantum oscillations in the distribution function in momentum space in the nuclear volume .",
    "the diffuse tail of the distribution function in momentum space leads to an increase of the collisional damping of the collective motion in the surface region of the nucleus and thus to an increase of the isoscalar gqr width .",
    "however this increase is strongly reduced due to the above - mentioned oscillations of the equilibrium distribution functions appearing in the collision integral eq .",
    "( [ dst ] ) . as a result",
    "the collisional width of the isoscalar gqr does not exceed 30 - 50% of the experimental value and agrees with the estimates of the width where the sharp thomas - fermi distribution function ( i.e. , in the absence of the diffusivity and quantum oscillations ) is used .",
    "the collisional damping in a cold fermi system arises only because of memory effects in the collision integral ( [ dst ] ) .    to describe the experimental values of the multipole giant resonances additional contributions from other spreading sources , such as the fragmentation width in random phase approximation calculations or its representation through the one - body dissipation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) have to be taken into account .",
    "we pointed out also that surface effects in the collisional damping are manifested more distinctly in the woods - saxon potential where the diffusivity parameter @xmath9 of the distribution function in momentum space is @xmath8 dependent and increases within the surface region of the nucleus .",
