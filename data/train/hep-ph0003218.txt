    "the light current quark masses are baisc input of quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) .",
    "the inequality of the light quark masses , especially , @xmath1 , breaks the isospin symmetry or charge symmetry@xcite .",
    "this breaking of isospin symmetry induces various measurable physics processes such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 mixing and @xmath0 decay etc . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the @xmath0 decay , which is considered as the important source of charge symmetry breaking in nuclear physics .    in ref.@xcite(we",
    "will quote it as @xmath9 hereafter ) we have shown that the chiral expansion at vector meson energy region converges slowly . therefore , a well - defined effective field theory describing the physics in this energy region must be available for calculation on high order terms of the chiral expansion and meson loops . obviously ,",
    "method of chiral perturbative theory(chpt)@xcite is impractical to cupature the high order term contribution because the number of free parameter increases very rapidly as perturbative order raising . in @xmath9 ,",
    "following the spirit of manohar - georgi(mg ) model@xcite , we have constructed chiral constituent quark model(chcqm ) including lowest vector meson resonances .",
    "the advatanges of this approach are that high order contribution of the chiral expansion and @xmath10 expansion can be calculated consistently , and only fewer free parameters are required . low energy limit and unitarity of the model",
    "are also examined successfully . in particular , it is a attractive property that although the leading order theoretical prediction does not match with experimental data , larger contribution from high order of the chiral expansion and pseudoscalar meson one - loop corrects theoretical prediction close to data very much .",
    "it is just the characteristic of the chiral expansion in this energy region .",
    "therefore , in this the present paper , we also need to calculate @xmath0 decay to include all high order contribution and pseudoscalar meson one - loop correction .",
    "this research is also motivated by the following reasons :    \\i ) in the most recent references@xcite , the @xmath0 decay was treated as being dominant via @xmath2-resonance exchange , and the direct @xmath11 coupling is neglected .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref.@xcite that the neglect of @xmath12 `` direct '' coupling to @xmath13 is not valid .",
    "it can be naturally understood since @xmath14 can make up of vector - isovector system , whose quantum numbers are same to @xmath2 meson .",
    "thus in an effective lagrangian based on chiral symmetry , every @xmath2 field can be replaced by @xmath14 and does not conflict with symmetry .",
    "although authors of ref.@xcite also pointed out that the present experimental data still can not be used to separate `` direct '' @xmath15 coupling from @xmath16 mixing contribution in model - independent way , it is very interesting to perform a theorectical investigation on `` direct '' @xmath15 coupling contribution . we will show that the contribution from interfernce of `` direct '' @xmath15 coupling and @xmath16 is about 15@xmath17 .",
    "thus `` direct '' @xmath15 coupling can not be neglected indeed .",
    "\\ii ) the present study involves the investigation of @xmath18 mixing , which has been an active subject[514 ] .",
    "the mixing amplitude for on - mass - shell vector mesons has been observed directly in the measurement of the pion form - factor in the time - like region from the process @xmath19@xcite . for roughly twenty years , @xmath18 mixing amplitude was assumed constant or momentum independt even if @xmath2 and @xmath12 have the space - like momenta , far from the on - shell point .",
    "several years ago , this assumption was firstly questioned by goldman _ et .",
    "al._@xcite , and the mixing amplitude was found to be significantly momentum dependent within a simple quark loop model .",
    "subsequently , various authors have argued such momentum dependence of the @xmath18 mixing amplitude by using various approaches@xcite . in particular , the authors of ref.@xcite has pointed out that @xmath18 mixing amplitude must vanish at @xmath20(where @xmath21 denotes the four - momentum square of the vector mesons ) within a broad class of model .",
    "this point will be also exmined in chcqm .",
    "\\iii ) it has been known that @xmath0 decay amplitude receive the contribution from two sources : isospin symmetry breaking due to @xmath22 quark mass difference and electromagnetic interaction . in * i *",
    "we have shown that vmd@xcite in meson physics is natural consequence of the present formlism instead of input .",
    "the vector  @xmath23 decays are also predicted successfully .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of electromagnetic interactions of mesons has been well established , and the calculation for @xmath0 decay from the transition @xmath24 and `` direct '' @xmath25 is straightforward . in this the present paper , we will pay our attention to isospin breaking due to @xmath1 .",
    "it is another purpose of this paper to determine isospin breaking parameter @xmath26 via @xmath0 decay .",
    "this parameter is urgently wanted by determination of light quark mass ratios .",
    "the contents of the paper are organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we review the basic notations of the chiral constituent quark model with the lowest vector meson resonances . in sect .",
    "3 , the tree level effective lagrangian , which including all order contribution of the chiral expansion , is obtained . the pseudoscalar meson one - loop corrections are calculated in sect .",
    "5 . in sect . 6 , the formulas and numerical results of @xmath27 mixing amplitude and @xmath0 are given .",
    "7 is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "the simplest version of chiral quark model which was originated by weinberg@xcite , and developed by manohar and georgi@xcite provides a qcd - inspired description on the simple constituent quark model . in view of this model , in the energy region between the chiral symmetry",
    "spontaneously broken ( cssb ) scale and the confinement scale ( @xmath28 ) , the dynamical field degrees of freedom are constituent quarks(quasi - particle of quarks ) , gluons and goldstone bosons associated with cssb(these goldstone bosons correspond to lowest pseudoscalar octet ) . in this quasiparticle description ,",
    "the effective coupling between gluon and quarks is small and the important interaction is the coupling between quarks and goldstone bosons . in * i * we have further included the lowest vector meson resonances into this formlism . at chiral limit",
    ", this model is parameterized by the following chiral constituent quark lagrangian @xmath29 here @xmath30 denotes trace in su(3 ) flavour space , @xmath31 are constituent quark fields .",
    "@xmath32 denotes vector meson octet and singlet , or more convenience , due to ozi rule , they are combined into a singlet `` nonet '' matrix @xmath33 the @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined as follows , @xmath36 and covariant derivative are defined as follows @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are linear combinations of external vector field @xmath40 and axial - vector field @xmath41 , @xmath42 associates with non - linear realization of spontanoeusly broken global chiral symmetry introduced by weinberg@xcite .",
    "this realization is obtained by specifying the action of global chiral group @xmath43 on element @xmath44 of the coset space @xmath45 : @xmath46 explicit form of @xmath44 is usual taken @xmath47 where the goldstone boson @xmath48 are treated as pseudoscalar meson octet .",
    "the compensating @xmath49 transformation @xmath50 defined by eq .",
    "(  [ 2.3 ] ) is th wanted ingredent for a non - linear realization of g. in practice , we shall be interested in transformations of @xmath51 and constituent quark fields under @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath52 transform as matter fields of su(3)@xmath53 , @xmath54 the vector meson fields transform homogeneously under su(3)@xmath53 @xmath55 which was suggested by weinberg@xcite and developed further by callan , coleman et .",
    "since under local g , the expilcit transformations of external vector and axial - vector fields are @xmath56 @xmath34 is su(3)@xmath53 is invariant field gradients and @xmath35 transforms as field connection of su(3)@xmath53 @xmath57 thus the lagrangian (  [ 2.1 ] ) is invariant under @xmath58 .",
    "the several remarks are need here .",
    "1 ) note that there is no kinetic term for vector meson fields in @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , in this formlism the vector mesons are treated as composited fields of constituent equarks instead of fundamental fields .",
    "the dynamics of vector meson resonances will be generated via loop effects of constituent quarks .",
    "2 ) note that there is kinetic term of pseudoscalar mesons in @xmath59 .",
    "this is different from some other chiral quark models , in which there is no such term .",
    "existing of this kinetic term is consistent with basic assumption of our model , because in this energy region , the dynamical field degrees of freedom are both constituent quarks and goldstone bosons associated with cssb .",
    "3 ) in @xmath59 the parameter @xmath60 is determined by @xmath61 decay of neutron .",
    "it has been pointed out in * i * that this value has included effects of intermediate axial - vector resonances exchanges at low energy . in addition , the constituent quark mass parameter @xmath62mev has been fitted in * i * via low energy limit of the model .",
    "such large value is requireed by convergence of chiral expansion at vector meson energy scale .    in this paper",
    ", we must go beyond chiral limit for obtaining isospin breaking results .",
    "the light current quark matrix @xmath63 can be usually included into external scalar fields , i.e. , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are scalar and pseudoscalar external fields respectively .",
    "the chiral transformation for @xmath68 is @xmath69 thus together with @xmath42 and @xmath70 , @xmath68 and @xmath71 can form su(3)@xmath53 invariant scalar source @xmath72 and pseudoscalar source @xmath73 .",
    "then current quark mass dependent lagrangian is written @xmath74 the above lagrangian will return to qcd lagrangian @xmath75 in absence of pseudoscalar mesons at high energy . so that there is a free parameter @xmath76 which can not be determined by symmetry alonely . from viewpoint of phenomenology , this ambiguity is similar to kaplan - manohar ambiguity in chpt@xcite .",
    "it will be studied at elsewhere so that we do not further discuss it here . in next section ,",
    "rigorous calculation will show that our results in this paper is independent of @xmath76 .    to conclude this section ,",
    "the chcqm lagrangian including the lowest vector meson resonances and light current quark masses is @xmath77 the effective lagrangian describing interaction of vector meson resonances will be generated via loop effects of constituent quarks .",
    "in this section , we will derive relevant effective lagrangian via calculating one - loop diagrams of constituent quarks , which is at the leading order in @xmath10 expansion . in our calculation , the light current quark masses will be treated as perturbation and be expanded to the leading order .",
    "pseudoscalar mesons which are localed in external line should satisfy soft pion theorem , i.e. , @xmath78(where @xmath79 denotes the four - momentum square of pseudoscalar mesons ) .",
    "however , @xmath21 is the four - momentum square of vector mesons , and obviously it is not very small comparing with chiral symmetry spantoneously broken scale .",
    "therefore , the higher order terms of @xmath21 in the chiral expansion , have significant contribution which can not be neglected . or in the other words , the chiral expansion at vector meson energy scale converge slowly",
    ". we will rigorously calculate all @xmath21-dependent term contribution .",
    "we start with constituent quark lagrangian (  [ 2.1 ] ) , and define vector external source @xmath80 , axial - vector external source @xmath81 , scalar external source @xmath82 and pseudoscalar external source @xmath83 as follows @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 are su(3 ) gell - mann matrices and @xmath86 ) .",
    "then in lagrangian (  [ 2.1 ] ) , the terms associating with constituent quark fields can be rewritten as follow @xmath87    the effective action describing meson interaction can be obtained via integrating over degrees of freedom of fermions @xmath88 where @xmath89 is vacuum expectation value in presence external sources .",
    "the above path integral can be performed explicitly , and heat kernal method@xcite has been used to regulate the result . however , this method is extremely difficult to compute very high order contributions in practice . in * i * we have provided an equivalent and efficient method to evaluate the effective action via calculating one - loop diagrams of constituent quarks directly .",
    "this method can capture all high order contributions of the chiral expansion .    in interaction picture , the equation (  [ 3.3 ] )",
    "is rewritten as follow @xmath90 where @xmath91 is time - order product of constituent quark fields , @xmath92 is interaction part of lagrangian (  [ 3.2 ] ) , @xmath93 is one - loop effects of constituent quarks with @xmath94 external sources , @xmath95 are four - momentas of @xmath94 external sources respectively and @xmath96 to get rid of all disconnected diagrams , we have @xmath97 hereafter we will call @xmath98 as @xmath94-point effective action .",
