    "road traffic prediction plays an important role in intelligent transport systems by providing the required real - time information for traffic management and congestion control , as well as the long - term traffic trend for transport infrastructure planning @xcite .",
    "road traffic predictions can be broadly classified into short - term traffic predictions and long - term traffic forecasts@xcite .",
    "short - term prediction is essential for the development of efficient traffic management and control systems , while long - term prediction is mainly useful for road design and transport infrastructure planning .",
    "there are two major categories of techniques for road traffic prediction : those based on non - parametric models and those based on parametric models .",
    "non - parametric model based techniques , such as k - nearest neighbors ( knn ) model @xcite and artificial neural networks ( ann ) @xcite , are inherently robust and valid under very weak assumptions @xcite , while parametric model based techniques , such as auto - regressive integrated moving average ( arima ) model @xcite and its variants @xcite@xcite , allows to integrate knowledge of the underlying traffic process in the form of traffic models that can then be used for traffic prediction .",
    "both categories of techniques have been widely used and in this paper , we consider parametric model based techniques , particularly starima ( space - time autoregressive integrated moving average)-based techniques .    as for the estimation of parameters and coefficients in starima model , overfitting easily",
    "occurs which makes the predictive performance poor as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the same model and hence the same correlation structure is used for traffic prediction at different time of the day , which is counter - intuitive and may not be accurate . to elaborate , consider an artificial example of two traffic stations @xmath0 and @xmath1 on a highway , where traffic station @xmath1 is at the down stream direction of @xmath0 .",
    "intuitively , the correlation between the traffic observed at @xmath0 and the traffic observed at @xmath1 will peak at a time lag corresponding to the time required to travel from @xmath0 to @xmath1 because at that time lag , the ( approximately ) same set of vehicles that have passed @xmath0 now have reached @xmath1 . obviously , the time required to travel from @xmath0 to @xmath1 depends on the traffic speed , which varies with the time of the day , e.g. peak hours and off - peak hours .",
    "accordingly , the time lag corresponding to the peak correlation between the traffic at @xmath0 and the traffic at @xmath1 should also vary with time of the day and , to be more specific , should approximately equal to the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 divided by the mean speed of vehicles between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in designing the starima model for traffic prediction , the aforementioned time - varying lags should be taken into account for accurate traffic prediction .    ]    ]    to validate the aforementioned intuition , we analyze the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of traffic flow data at two traffic stations ( stations 6 and 3 ) , denoted as @xmath2 , from i-80 highway ( more details of data are discussed in section [ sub : data_collection ] ) with the formulation :    @xmath3}{\\sigma_{uu}\\sigma{}_{yy}}\\label{eq : corr_u_y}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the traffic flow data collected in @xmath6 time slots from the two traffic stations , @xmath7 is the temporal order in the range of @xmath8\\subset\\mathbf{n}$ ] , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the standard deviation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a higher value of ccf indicates a stronger correlation of the traffic at both stations . as shown in fig.[fig : flow_3_6 ] , the correlation between traffic at stations 6 and 3 peaks at different time lags depending on the time of the day . during on - peak period ( approximately from 6:30am - 8:30am ) , the correlation peaks at a time lag of @xmath11 ( one time lag corresponds to @xmath12 ) while during off - peak period ( approximately from 19pm - 24pm ) , the correlation peaks at a time lag of @xmath13 , where one time lag corresponds to a time of 30@xmath14 .",
    "we observe that at peak hours , the time lag corresponding to the maximum correlation is larger than that for off - peak hours . in the latter section , we will further show that this time lag approximately equals to the distance between the two traffic stations divided by the average speed .",
    "therefore , our intuition explained in the previous paragraph is valid .",
    "the above observation motivates us to design a starima - based traffic prediction with time - varying lags which better matches the time - varying correlation structure between traffic of different stations and hence can potentially deliver more accurate traffic prediction .",
    "more specifically , the contributions of the paper are :    * we analyze the ccf between the speed and traffic flow data between different detector stations and establish the relationship between the changes in the temporal lag ( corresponding to the aforementioned maximum correlation ) and the speed variations . *",
    "an unsupervised classification algorithm based on isodata algorithm is designed to classify different time periods of the day according to the variation of the speed .",
    "the classification helps to determine the appropriate time lag to use in the starima model . * a starima - based model with time - varying lags",
    "is developed for short - term traffic prediction .",
    "experimental results using real traffic data show that the developed starima - based model with time - varying lags has superior accuracy compared with its counterpart developed using the traditional cross - correlation function and without employing time - varying lags .",
    "the the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : related_work ] , we briefly discuss related work . section [ sec : data_method ] introduces the starima model and the isodata algorithm in section [ sec : starima_time_lag_variation ] , we present the details the proposed algorithm .",
    "the experimental results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "there is previous work , which predicts traffic flow using a modified arima models @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite , a multivariate arima based model , arimax ,",
    "was applied for better traffic flow prediction .",
    "the difference is that the former paper considered the varibility of the speed from upstream to downstream , the other one considered different model specifications during different time periods of the day .",
    "similarly , the authors in @xcite also different configurations of temporal lags in arima model . more concretely , they firstly applied a hidden markov model ( hmm ) model along with an expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm to evaluate the traffic state ( one of \\{major accident , minor incident , instability , normal driving } ) in next time slot .",
    "after that , the arima models with different configurations of temporal lags were used to predict the state of the traffic flow .",
    "all these models have improved the accuracy of the forecasting results compared with arima model . however , the spatial information was less considered in these models . in this way , the starima based models @xcite have aroused more and more concern .    ]    in @xcite , the authors proposed a dynamic starima model by combining the dynamic turn ratio prediction ( dtrp ) model and the starima model . in this paper ,",
    "a dynamic space weigh matrix is used to capture different impact of traffic at upstream locations on traffic at downstream locations .",
    "similarly , the research in @xcite also applied the starima model with the consideration of the dynamic space weight matrix .",
    "our work distinguish from theirs in that in our work , the space weight matrices vary with on - peak and off - peak periods to capture the time - varying correlations of road traffic at different locations .    from the above related work , we can find that the \" `` dynamic' of a arima or starima model in existing research is often used to indicate the dynamic of the space weight matrix , the traffic state during different time periods @xcite . however , sometimes it is not enough to only consider these aspects .",
    "for example , fig.[fig : speed_flow_data ] presents the normalized average speed and normalized flow data collected at traffic station 6 every 30 minutes in one day .",
    "theoretically , the weight matrix in time slot 3 ( or 4 , the left hollow rectangle ) and slot 15 ( the right hollow rectangle ) should be different since they are respectively in the off - peak period and peak period . however , their average speed are the same .",
    "this is caused by an inaccurate evaluation of the time range of peak or off - peak period .",
    "furthermore , few research considered the relationship between speed and the parameters ( temporal or spatial lag ) in starima model .",
    "specially , a great majority of research use pacf to evaluate temporal lag which easily causes overfitting problem .",
    "motivated by the above observations , in this paper we investigate a more efficient method to evaluate these parameters in starima model with the consideration of spatial information and the variation of average speed during different time periods .",
    "]    [ sub : data_collection ]    in urban environment , the road structure is often complex .",
    "also , the sensors ( such as loop detectors or cameras ) @xcite are not deployed at every road .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to obtain comprehensive data . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider highway in this paper where there are only on - ramp / off - ramps so the traffic condition is comparatively simpler than that in the urban area .",
    "we use data collected from a segment of interstate 80 ( i-80 ) freeway located in emeryville , california @xcite .",
    "available data are collected every 30 seconds from six traffic stations numbered by 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 within 10 days .",
    "there are two traffic stations for upstream and downstream traffic respectively .",
    "the road topology is shown in fig.[fig : real_scenario_and_topology ] .",
    "note that there is no data at station 2 and there are too many interference caused by on or off - ramps at station 1 and 7 . for simplicity",
    ", we only use the data collected at stations 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "the travel direction is from station 3 to 6 .",
    "in this section , we first present a simple way to evaluate the temporal lag in relation to speed variation .",
    "then we propose a classification algorithm based on isodata by which we can respectively obtain a set of speed clusters and a set of time period clusters .",
    "finally , we describe a modified starima model with the varying temporal lag .      from fig.[fig :",
    "ccf_3_6_different_time_period ] , the temporal lags with maximal ccf between stations 6 and 3 are different during peak and off - peak periods .",
    "this is attributable to the variation of speed . assuming the distance between two detector stations @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath15 , and the vehicles keep a stable average speed @xmath16 , then approximately @xmath17 is needed for vehicles to travel from @xmath1 to @xmath0 . in other words , the traffic flow collected at station @xmath0",
    "is strongly correlated with that at @xmath1 @xmath18 time ago .",
    "thus the temporal lag with the maximum correlation should be @xmath19 $ ] where @xmath20 is the length of one temporal lag .",
    "note that @xmath15 depend on the spatial order @xmath21 in the starima model and @xmath16 can often be measured by loop detectors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the advance in telecommunication and electronic technology also brings a number of new techniques that allows us to estimate the travel time , e.g. via smartphones .",
    "indeed , the observation discussed in the introduction section suggests another novel way to estimate travel time : we can infer travel time from the correlation of the observed traffic .    in order to validate the above discussion",
    ", we further analyze the results in fig.[fig : ccf_3_6_different_time_period ] by using the f average speed information at stations 3 and 6 , which is collected in the same day as the traffic flow data used in fig.[fig : ccf_3_6_different_time_period ] .",
    "specifically , the average speed from station 3 to station 6 between 6:30 am and 8:30 am is 44.45 feet / second .",
    "the average speed is 67.05 feet / second between 19 pm and 24 pm .",
    "the maximal temporal lag during these two time periods is respectively 3 and 2 with 30 seconds in each temporal lag . as @xmath22 ,",
    "given @xmath23and @xmath24 during two time periods along with the corresponding best temporal lag @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we are able to obtain the following equation according to the theoretical analysis above :    @xmath27    substituting the data into formulation , it is easy to find @xmath28 .",
    "this result agrees with our theoretical analysis and verifies our speculation that temporal @xmath29 is a function of the variation of average speed @xmath16 in section [ sec : introduction ] .",
    "an easy way to classify speed data is by dividing into peak time and off - peak periods .",
    "after that , the temporal lag can be calculated using @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the average speed in time period @xmath32\\{peak , off - peak}. however an empirical classification is often prone to error and inaccuracy .",
    "recall the analysis in section [ sec : related_work ] , the evaluation of the average speed is sensitive to the time range selected for peak or off - peak period .",
    "it is obvious that the speed is not always fast even during off - peak period from fig .",
    "[ fig : speed_flow_data ] .",
    "therefore , in this paper an isodata based speed data classification algorithm is developed to deliver an accurate classification . using this algorithm , we firstly classify the speed data collected in each time slot into different clusters .",
    "after that , the time period clusters are confirmed based on the time slots contained in different speed clusters .",

    "the speed data classification algorithm is given in algorithm [ alg : speed - data - classification ] .",
    "in line [ algo - isodata ] , the isodata algorithm is implemented to get speed clusters .",
    "the time period clusters are obtained from line [ algo - for - start-1 ] to [ algo - for - end-1 ] .",
