    "high mobility two dimensional electron gases formed in gaas / algaas heterostructures allow ballistic motion of electrons over distances of several @xmath2 m at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "ballistic system is realized at low temperatures , low electron densities and low impurity concentrations .",
    "such samples are used in many experiments to study various novel transport properties in low dimensional mesoscopic semiconductors , and a lot of interesting phenomena have been discovered .",
    "one of such mesoscopic systems is a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a periodic antidot array .    when the sample s typical geometrical scale , such as the distance between antidots , is larger than the fermi wave length , the dynamics of a wave packet approaches the classical limit .",
    "semi - classical model explains some experimental results in this system , such as the quenching of the hall resistance in low fields@xcite , and the oscillatory field - dependence of the magnetoresistance in an antidot array @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the potential is periodically modulated , and the commensurability of the period of potential and the cyclotron radius plays an important role .",
    "variety of interesting features appear in the diagonal and hall resistances due to this commensurability effect .",
    "most of the features are now well understood in terms of classical orbits .",
    "for example , the peak structure of magnetoresistance is explained by the existence of runaway orbits.@xcite detailed analyses of the hall resistivity have made clear the step - like structure of the hall resistivity accompanied by the peak of the diagonal resistivity,@xcite and the negative and vanishing hall resistivity in low field regime.@xcite the quantum transport is also studied extensively @xcite to clarify the altshuler - aronov - spivak effect @xcite and the anderson localization @xcite in antidot systems .",
    "then , the question arises .",
    "can we observe similar effect when the magnetic fields instead of potentials are modulated ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "many peculiar features are observed experimentally when the magnetic field is modulated one dimensionally@xcite and two dimensionally@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically calculate the magnetoresistance as well as the hall resistance in the presence of two dimensionally modulated magnetic fields . a classical billiard model is adopted and use is made of the kubo formula to obtain the transport coefficients .",
    "such a classical model is justified , since the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the transport coefficients is weak , suggesting that the quantum interference effects may be neglected .    in the next section ,",
    "we explain the model in detail , and in the third section , we present the results .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "besides a uniform magnetic field @xmath3 , the periodically modulated fields @xmath4 are applied perpendicular to the plane of 2deg in the model .",
    "experimentally , these modulated magnetic fields are formed by ferromagnetic metals or a type ii superconductor put on the surface of the heterostructure .",
    "we introduce dimensionless variables @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the basic lattice constant of the artificial structure of @xmath4 , @xmath7 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath8 .",
    "we scale the magnetic field by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the effective mass of electron , and @xmath11 is the electron charge .",
    "thus @xmath12 corresponds to a cyclotron radius of @xmath13 .",
    "we ignore inelastic scattering mechanism in this system , and therefore the classical electron velocity @xmath14 is conserved .",
    "the equations of motion is given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a total magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the 2deg and scaled by @xmath17 .",
    "it is a sum of the external uniform and periodically modulated magnetic field , @xmath18    we use two types of modulated magnetic fields @xmath4 . in one model ( type i )",
    ", @xmath4 is finite and constant only in a finite region of radius @xmath19 and zero otherwise ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . in the other model ( type ii ) ,",
    "a smooth space variation is assumed for the modulated field ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . whether we take type i model or type ii depends on how we realize the periodically modulated fields experimentally .    in the first case ( type i ) , the magnetic field @xmath20 is constant and changes discontinuously in the designed region which exists at intervals . in the unit cell",
    "whose center is at the origin , it is expressed as    @xmath21    in the second case ( type ii ) , we use smooth function for @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath22^{\\beta }   , \\label{e5}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 controls the steepness of the modulated magnetic field .",
    "the factor @xmath24 in eq.([e5 ] ) determines the maximum value of the modulated magnetic field , and @xmath25 controls the period of modulation .",
    "we consider here only the case where @xmath26 .",
    "we apply the classical linear response theory@xcite to calculate the conductivity tensor , and @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the velocity correlation averaged over initial condition . here",
    "@xmath30 is the average time scaled by @xmath31 between two impurity scatterings in this system .",
    "impurity scatterings are not taken into account in the calculation of the equation of motion eq.([e2 ] ) , assuming that the impurity scattering effect and the classical motion are separable as expressed in eq.([e6 ] ) .",
    "a similar assumption was adopted in ref.@xcite to obtain magnetoresistance oscillations in an antidot array . in this paper we chose @xmath32 .",
    "we compute @xmath29 by numerically integrating eq.([e6 ] ) to obtain @xmath27 . in the actual simulation ,",
    "ten thousands of random initial conditions are chosen for the average , and the resulting error ( standard deviation ) of the data points is typically a few percent . from the conductivity tensor ,",
    "the magnetoresistance @xmath33 and the hall resistance @xmath34 are expressed as @xmath35 @xmath36",
    "2 , we show three typical trajectories found through a numerical simulation of the classical electron motion in periodic modulated magnetic systems ( type i , ii ) , chaotic , pinned and runaway trajectories@xcite .",
    "the chaotic trajectory represents an ordinary diffusion mechanism .",
    "most trajectories belong to this type of the chaotic trajectory which appear in all magnetic fields we examined .",
    "the pinned trajectory is a non - diffusive trajectory which exists only near commensurability external magnetic fields ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is confined around a modulated magnetic field for a long time , and does not contribute to the diffusion .",
    "the runaway trajectory skips between the periodic modulation along @xmath0 or @xmath1 direction .",
    "this trajectory appears suddenly from chaotic or pinned trajectories as the cyclotron diameter becomes commensurate with the lattice constant .",
    "it does not persist for a very long time .",
    "it is a chaotic trajectory in a strict sense .",
    "figure 3 shows a typical result for the longitudinal resistance @xmath33 and the hall resistance @xmath34 in a type i model as a function of the externally applied field @xmath3 .",
    "the period of the magnetic modulation is @xmath6 , the radius of the modulated field region @xmath19 is @xmath38 , and the strength of the modulated magnetic field @xmath24 is @xmath39 .",
    "resistances are scaled by @xmath40 which is the resistance of the system without the field modulation and without the applied external field .",
    "first , we report the behavior of the longitudinal resistance ( fig .",
    "3 , the solid line ) .",
    "we observe two features .",
    "one is that the peaks of the longitudinal resistance clearly appear near the commensurability magnetic fields ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the other is the asymmetry of magnetoresistance about zero field .",
    "these structures are characteristic in the periodically modulated magnetic fields .",
    "we then change the strength of the modulated field @xmath4 .",
    "the commensurability peak decreases with the decrease of a modulated field @xmath4 and disappears at low field ( fig .",
    "the peaks disappear when the cyclotron diameter in the modulated region is larger than the diameter of the modulated region .",
    "the magnetoresistance is influenced by the shape and strength of the modulation . in case of smooth modulated model ( type ii ) ,",
    "the structure of the longitudinal resistance is similar to type i ( fig .",
    "however , the peak of the smooth modulated model shifts to a lower magnetic field when we use the same value for @xmath24 as in type i. when the steepness parameter @xmath23 increases , the peak position approaches to the one in the type i model .",
    "the hall resistance @xmath34 also shows peculiar features . in fig .",
    "3 , we observe that the magnetoresistance peaks are accompanied by the abrupt increase of @xmath34 .",
    "this is also observed in the type ii model ( fig .",
    "5 ) . furthermore , in the type ii model",
    ", @xmath34 shows three plateaus between the sharp changes .",
    "there is the asymmetry of magnetoresistance about zero field .",
    "note that the hall resistance is still positive when @xmath41 .",
    "the step - like structure of @xmath34 in antidot systems has been analyzed in detail and explained by ishizaka and ando.@xcite they have introduced a hopping model to simplify the classical motion of electrons , and have classified the trajectories ( called _ components _ ) by the successive center coordinates of the antidots which scatter the electron .",
    "the step of @xmath34 has been shown to arise from the cancelation of the contributions from the right going components and the left going ones . as seen from fig .",
    "2 , the chaotic motions of the electrons in modulated magnetic fields can also be mapped onto such simplified components , though the scattering mechanism is completely different .",
    "therefore , the step - like structure accompanied by the peak of the diagonal resistivity in this system is also explained according to the picture .",
    "the non - vanishing value of @xmath34 at @xmath41 will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we have also examined the other lattice structure , namely the triangular lattice . in this case",
    ", runaway trajectory skips along @xmath42 or @xmath43 direction , and the peaks in the resistivity again appear at the commensurability fields .",
    "the above results that peaks of the longitudinal resistance occur near the commensurability magnetic fields suggests that pinned or runaway trajectories contributes to the peaks .",
    "the pinned trajectory at commensurate magnetic field can not explain the difference of magnetoresistance peak positions between positive and negative external field , nor the disappearance of the commensurability peaks at low modulated field , since the pinned trajectory is not influenced by the direction of the external field and the strength of the modulation .",
    "an asymmetry of magnetoresistance about zero field and its dependence on strength of modulated magnetic field are explained only by the runaway trajectory .",
    "this means that runaway trajectories shown in fig .",
    "2 are essential to explain the simulation .",
    "figure 6(a ) and ( b ) show typical runaway trajectories at fields given by eqs.([e81 ] ) and ( [ e82 ] ) , respectively .",
    "when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in the same direction , @xmath46 is the condition that a runaway trajectory appears , where @xmath47 is the cyclotron radius in the absence of modulation , and @xmath48 is the cyclotron radius in the modulated region . when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in the opposite directions , the condition changes to @xmath49 .",
    "the peak positions of the magnetoresistance obtained in the simulations are in good agreement with the field values given by eqs.([e81 ] ) and ( [ e82 ] ) , as indicated in fig . 3 by arrows . in smoothly modulated magnetic field",
    ", electron motion is bended more strongly than in the absence of modulation . in this case",
    ", the runaway trajectory appears in the lower field than the field expected from eqs.([e81 ] ) and ( [ e82 ] ) .",
    "this is the reason why peaks for the type ii model shift to a lower field .",
    "as stated in the previous section , @xmath34 remains to be positive even when the external field @xmath3 is vanishing .",
    "to explain this behavior , we have introduced the effective magnetic fields .",
    "we introduce an averaged magnetic field @xmath50 felt by electron as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the position of the electron .",
    "the obtained @xmath50 looks almost linearly dependent on @xmath3 and is well described by @xmath53 this effectively shifts the point of @xmath54 to a negative value of @xmath3 ( fig . 7 ) . here",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are constant and the values are summarized in table i. in type i model , @xmath55 increases and becomes almost equal to unity as @xmath24 increases .",
    "this is because the electron can not stay in the modulated field region for long when @xmath24 is large .",
    "this idea of the effective field qualitatively explains the positive value of @xmath34 at @xmath41 , since @xmath57 even if @xmath41 .",
    "however , @xmath50 remains positive even when @xmath58 .",
    "one might think that such vanishing of @xmath34 for positive @xmath50 can be explained by the vanishing of the hall resistivity@xcite , but we do not observe the plateau or non - monotonic behavior around @xmath58 which is typical for the vanishing @xmath34 . the fact that @xmath59 and @xmath60 means that the non - uniform magnetic fields act as scatterers as well as magnetic fields bending the electron trajectories and giving rise to the hall effect .    to summarize",
    ", we have studied the transport properties in two dimensional periodic magnetic fields by numerical simulation using classical model and explained the mechanism of magnetoresistance peaks accompanied by sharp changes of the hall resistance by the runaway trajectory .",
    "runaway trajectories are found to play a very important role in periodically modulated magnetic fields similarly as in the antidot array systems .    in real experiments",
    "performed so far @xcite , attaching ferromagnets to produce modulated magnetic fields necessarily introduces a strain induced electric potential as well , while in our simulation , we have assumed that the effect of magnetic field modulation is much stronger than that of the scalar potential modulation and have neglected its effect .",
    "furthermore , the field modulation is assumed to be stronger than the externally applied field .",
    "such assumptions might be satisfied by introducing the modulated field by attaching type ii superconductor.@xcite density modulated composite fermion systems with @xmath61@xcite may also be a possible candidate .",
