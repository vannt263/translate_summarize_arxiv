    "for @xmath1 , the _ polar decomposition _ of @xmath2 is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a partial isometry and @xmath5 .",
    "the _ aluthge transform _ of @xmath2 is the operator @xmath6 .",
    "this transform was first considered in alu in order to study @xmath7-hyponormal and @xmath9-hyponormal operators .  roughly speaking ,",
    "the idea behind the aluthge transform is to convert an operator into another operator which shares with the first one some spectral properties , but it is closer to being a normal operator .  in recent years",
    ", the aluthge transform has received substantial attention .",
    "jung , ko and pearcy proved in @xcite that @xmath2 has a nontrivial invariant subspace if and only if @xmath10 does .",
    "( since every normal operator has nontrivial invariant subspaces , the aluthge transform has a natural connection with the invariant subspace problem . )     for a weighted shift @xmath11 , the aluthge transform @xmath12 of @xmath13 is also a unilateral weighted shift , given by @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath13 is hyponormal if and only if @xmath15 .",
    "thus , if @xmath16 is hyponormal , then @xmath12 is also hyponormal .",
    "however , the converse is not true in general .",

    "lee , w.y .",
    "lee , and the second - named author showed that for @xmath20 , the aluthge transform , when acting on weighted shifts , need not preserve @xmath21-hyponormality .",
    "finally , g. exner proved in @xcite that the aluthge transform of a subnormal weighted shift need not be subnormal .    in this article , we first introduce the polar decompositions of a commuting pair of bounded operators and study two aluthge transforms ( toral and spherical ) of @xmath0-variable weighted shifts @xmath8 .",
    "since a priori there are several possible notions , we discuss two plausible definitions and their basic properties in section 2 .",
    "our research will allow us to compare both definitions in terms of how well they generalize the @xmath22-variable notion .",
    "after discussing some basic properties of each aluthge transform , we proceed to study both transforms in the case of @xmath0-variable weighted shifts .",
    "we consider such topics as preservation of joint hyponormality , norm continuity , spherical quasinormality , and spherical isometries .",
    "we first recall that a commuting pair is subnormal if and only if it is @xmath21-hyponormal for every @xmath23 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) ) .  for @xmath24 ,",
    "we consider the polar decomposition @xmath25 of @xmath26 .",
    "then , for a @xmath0-variable weighted shift @xmath27 , we define the _ toral _ aluthge transform of @xmath28 as follows : @xmath29 .  as we will see in proposition [ prop1 ] , the commutativity of @xmath30 does not automatically follow from the commutativity of @xmath28 .",
    "there is a second plausible definition of aluthge transform , which uses a joint polar decomposition .",
    "assume that we have a decomposition of the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "we refer to @xmath35 as the _ spherical _ aluthge transform of @xmath28 .",

    "we will prove in section 2 that this particular definition of the aluthge transform preserves commutativity , and it also behaves well in terms of hyponormality , for a large class of @xmath0-variable weighted shifts .",
    "there is also another useful aspect of the spherical aluthge transform , which we now mention .",
    "if we consider the fixed points of this transform acting on @xmath0-variable weighted shifts , we obtain an appropriate generalization of the concept of quasinormality .  more precisely , if a @xmath0-variable weighted shift @xmath42 satisfies @xmath43 , then @xmath44 is , up to scalar multiple , a spherical isometry .",
    "( we recall that a commuting pair @xmath45 is called a _",
    "spherical isometry _ if @xmath46 @xcite . )",
    "it follows that we can then study some properties of the spherical aluthge transform using well known results about spherical isometries .  in this paper",
    ", we also focus on the following basic problem .",
    "[ problem 1 ] ( i ) for @xmath23 , if @xmath28 is @xmath21-hyponormal , does it follow that the toral aluthge transform @xmath30 @xmath21-hyponormal ?",

    "when does either aluthge transform preserve hyponormality ? ; ( ii ) when do we have the equality @xmath47 ? ; ( iii ) is the toral aluthge transform @xmath48 continuous in the uniform topology ?",
    "similarly , does continuity hold for the spherical aluthge transform ?",
    "we first consider ( joint ) hyponormality for the toral and spherical aluthge transforms .",

    "( ii ) if @xmath28 is a commuting pair of hyponormal operators , so is @xmath51 .",
    "we next show that there exists a subnormal @xmath28 such that @xmath30 is not hyponormal ; we also prove that there exists a non - hyponormal @xmath28 such that @xmath51 is hyponormal .",

    "the _ core _ @xmath52 of @xmath53 is the restriction of @xmath28 to the invariant subspace @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "thus , @xmath28 is hyponormal but @xmath30 is not hyponormal if @xmath88 , and @xmath35 is hyponormal but @xmath28 is not hyponormal if @xmath89 .",
    "next , we consider the invariance of hyponormality under the two aluthge transforms .",
    "we describe a large class of @xmath0-variable weighted shifts for which both transforms coincide .  by figure",
    "[ figure 1](ii ) and ( iii ) , and direct calculations , we observe that @xmath90 .",
