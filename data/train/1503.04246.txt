    "the past decade in extragalactic astronomy has been characterized by a tremendous increase in the understanding of the properties of high-@xmath0 galaxies ( for reviews see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as the diversity and evolution of their star formation rate ( sfr ) histories @xcite , the relation between stellar mass and luminosity @xcite , the relation between mass and metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the nature of extinction as a function of luminosity @xcite .",
    "this progress has been driven by multi - band flux - limited surveys of ever - improving depth and coverage permitting the study of galaxies at redshifts ranging from @xmath610 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these surveys are however not suited to assess the contribution of the faintest galaxies to the cosmic star formation history .",
    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) selected galaxy studies provide a complementary approach to constrain galaxy evolution across the whole mass spectrum @xcite and from very low to very high redshift ( the most distant grb with a spectroscopic redshift known to date is grb 090423 at @xmath7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of grb - selected galaxy studies is that grb production requires ( in its simplest form ) only a massive star ( for a review see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which makes their detection independent of galaxy luminosity .",
    "the exact relation between the grb rate and the sfr is controversial : while long - duration grbs are produced by massive stars and sample the entire range of known star - forming galaxies from faint dwarfs up to luminous lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ; @xcite ) and sub - millimeter galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found that the numbers of grbs produced at high redshift imply that either the global sfr density is greater at high redshift than found from lbg surveys , or that grb production efficiency increases with redshift .",
    "other authors consider that this result can be explained by continuing observational and redshift biases in existing grb surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we approach this question from the unique standpoint of having observations of the properties of the individual hosts of each burst in an observationally unbiased grb sample , thus providing a complementary approach to simulation studies .",
    " the optically unbiased grb host \" ( tough ) survey by @xcite is the first such survey to make use of the strategic advantage of _ swift _  to realize the production of a grb host galaxy sample selected solely by accurate x - ray localization and vlt observability , and unbiased by optical criteria such as afterglow detection or brightness . in this paper , we compare the evolution of the uv lf of grb host galaxies to those derived both from lbg samples and those predicted from stellar population synthesis models @xcite which include both metallicity dependent and independent channels for grb production .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a @xmath8cdm cosmology with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "all reported magnitudes are given in the ab system , and uncertainties are given at @xmath12 confidence level , if not stated otherwise .",
    "the tough survey targeted 69 grbs in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands with fors2 and isaac reaching limiting magnitudes of @xmath15 mag and @xmath16 mag at @xmath17 confidence level .",

    "in addition , the hosts between @xmath19 and @xmath2 were targets of a moderately deep spectroscopy campaign to study ly@xmath20 in emission , and hosts at @xmath21 were part of a radio survey .",
    "these campaigns allowed the investigation of several properties such as the @xmath22-color and the offset distribution ( * ? ? ? * malesani et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) , the redshift distribution @xcite , the ly@xmath20 recovery rate @xcite , and the unobscured sfr inferred from radio observations for the hosts at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    ".log of grb host observations [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : lf_lit ]    figure[fig : cdf ] displays the grb host galaxy cumulative distributions for the four redshift intervals .",
    "since grbs are produced by the collapse of very massive stars , it has been suggested that grbs should select galaxies according to their sfr . in the simplest model",
    ", @xcite proposed that the uv grb - host luminosity function should be similar to that lbg samples weighted by their sfr , where the sfr is proportional to the _ unobscured _ uv luminosity , which can be expressed as @xmath23 .",
    "following @xcite , we use @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the cumulative distributions of the sfr - weighted lbg luminosity functions from table [ tab : lf_lit ] are overlaid in the same plot .    at low and high redshift ,",
    "the observed distribution differs significantly from the no metallicity bias ( or equivalently , lbg derived ) model lfs . in the @xmath26 region for example , we can reject the null hypothesis of the data being drawn from the sfr weighted lbg lf at a level of @xmath27 via a ks test . in",
    "the medium redshift ranges ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) the data are insufficient to distinguish reliably between any of the models , particularly due to some non - detections and the possibility of some of the hosts of unknown redshift being within these bins as discussed in the next section .     and",
    "@xmath2 as the number of hosts with unknown redshift is increased .",
    "the color - shaded regions represent the 16 and 84 percentiles of the mc simulations . with the null hypothesis that the data may be drawn from the respective model lf , the white area of the plot represents rejection of this null hypothesis with a probability level of it being correct of @xmath30 ( @xmath17 equivalent ) . within the gray shaded region ,",
    "the dashed and dotted lines display the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 equivalent ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath12 equivalent ) rejection levels respectively .",
    "see section [ sec : unknown_z ] for details . ]",
    "there are nine hosts in our sample with redshifts unknown within certain limits . as discussed in @xcite , a conservative upper limit of @xmath34",
    "can be placed on four of the bursts associated with these hosts via their measured excess ( above galactic ) x - ray absorption following the method of @xcite .",
    "the remaining five bursts can be at higher redshifts ( see table [ tab : host_mag ] for details ) .",
    "in this paper we set a formal redshift limit of @xmath34 to avoid corrections for igm and ly@xmath20 absorption .",
    "these unknown redshift hosts can therefore exist anywhere along the gray tracks plotted in the right hand panel of figure[fig : scatter_1 ] .",
    "the maximum plausible redshift of @xmath35 is approximately coincident with the midpoint of our highest redshift lbg comparison sample , and in figure  [ fig : cdf ] we also show the effect of placing all the unknown hosts at the midpoint of each lbg comparison range in turn ( hatched regions ) . as can be seen from the bottom panel in this plot , if all unknown redshift hosts are actually at their highest plausible redshift , which may be a likely scenario ( see figure11 in @xcite ) , and all upper limits are treated as detections , then the likelihood ( ks probability ) of the tough cumulative distribution being consistent with the sfr weighted lbg model rises to 1.0% .",
    "note that this value represents our most conservative limit compared to the more flexible simulation discussed below .    to quantify how many of the tough hosts with unknown redshift would be required to be within the range @xmath36 in order to make the tough host luminosity function consistent with the sfr - weighted lbg lf , we performed a monte - carlo simulation as follows .",
    "one of the nine hosts with unknown redshift is chosen at random and assigned a random redshift between @xmath36 .",
    "the appropriate host luminosity is then drawn from a normal distribution centered around the observation value with a width ( @xmath12 ) of the detection error for detected hosts , and a uniform distribution between the upper limit and the luminosity of the faintest host in the tough @xmath37 sample for those hosts with an upper limit only .",
    "this host is added to the tough cdf , and a ks value computed between the new cdf and the sfr weighted lbg - lf .",
    "the process is repeated 30,000 times and a mean and median ks value obtained .",
    "we then successively add hosts of unknown redshift and repeat the procedure until all nine hosts are included in the cdf .",
    "figure [ fig : ks_2 ] shows how the measured ks value varies with the number of added hosts of unknown redshift .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : ks_2 ] , at least 3 unknown hosts are required for the tough distribution to fall below the @xmath17 equivalent rejection probability level of @xmath30 chance of consistency with being drawn from the sfr - weighted lbg ( no metallicity bias ) lf model . even when all unknown redshift hosts are included in the simulation ,",
    "the median ks probability of the distributions being consistent is only 0.8% .",
    "the gap may be closed further if some of the unknown hosts are at higher redshifts still ( @xmath38 ) since their @xmath13-band observations then would have been significantly affected by igm and ly@xmath20 absorption . nevertheless , the metallicity dependent models of @xcite appear a better fit to the data , with critical ks rejection levels much lower .",
    "we emphasize again that these models do not represent a fixed fraction of grb production via metal dependent and independent channels , but are derived from stellar population syntheses combined with a grb production efficiency model with respect to metallicity controlled by the value of @xmath39 .",
    "lower ( but non - zero ) @xmath39 values represent a stronger level of bias toward low metallicity hosts , as expected from the collapsar model .",
    "we note that the @xmath40 model ( blue lines ) which represents a stringent metallicity plateau for grb production is effectively ruled out by observations of some high metallicity grb hosts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are plotted as convenient limits for comparison only .",
    "the tough sample is independent of the brightness of the optical afterglow , but the properties of the prompt emission could still bias the sample toward a certain grb population and hence a certain host galaxy population .",
    "we find no correlation between the host properties and energy released at @xmath41-ray energies , @xmath42 ( values taken from @xcite ) , or the peak flux photon flux ( taken from @xcite ) at any redshift . at low redshift ( where we are sampling the greatest proportion of the grb @xmath41-ray luminosity function itself )",
    "there is also no tendency for brighter bursts to favor dimmer hosts , and we therefore do not believe any flux limited observational bias of the bursts themselves significantly affects any of our conclusions regarding the hosts .",
    "previous grb host surveys have tended to be biased toward bursts with optically brighter afterglows and/or hosts , whereas the tough sample ( as stressed throughout this work ) is independent of the optical properties of bursts or hosts . to examine whether these previous observational biases are significant or",
    "not , we investigate whether the same conclusions could be drawn from a previous heterogeneous sample . to address this question we retrieved all host measurements that probe the rest - frame uv continuum from the ghosts database @xcite . until 2012",
    "january ( before the first results from the tough survey were published ) , the database comprised observations for over 120 hosts . as an example , we build the uv luminosity distributions for this sample and divide them into the same redshift and luminosity bins as the tough sample .    the observed cumulative distributions are shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : cdf2 ] , along with those of the tough sample in the upper panels .",
    "at all redshifts , except perhaps for @xmath28 , we see an overabundance of luminous galaxies in the ghosts sample compared to tough .",
    "this clearly shows that selection effects from grb afterglow observations must be carefully taken into account before attempting to extract any ensemble properties .",
    "the limiting magnitudes in the ghosts sample are in general also significantly shallower than ours . to be able to extract any meaningful results , grb - selected galaxy samples need to be carried out to the magnitude limits of lbg surveys , i.e. , reaching at least @xmath43  mag .",
    "our findings let us draw the following picture .",
    "grbs probe the full luminosity range ( and below ) of lbg surveys at all comparable redshifts .",
    "furthermore , throughout the entire redshift range of our sample , grb hosts appear consistent with models of grbs being produced by a combination of a metal - dependent ( single star collapsar ) and independent ( binary progenitor ) channel with a relatively high level of bias ( low , but non - zero value of @xmath39 ) toward low metallicity hosts @xcite , though we can not completely rule out the unbiased models in the range @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior may also lend support to the model of the starvation of infalling pristine gas at @xmath44-1.5 proposed by @xcite , moving the grb host population away from lbg galaxies as a whole to low - mass uv faint galaxies as redshift decreases .    at @xmath45",
    ", we observe a lack of uv luminous grb hosts .",
    "all detected hosts ( except one ) are at least 3 mag fainter than @xmath46 galaxies .",
    "if grb hosts were truly similar to lbgs , we may expect this connection to improve at higher redshifts , where any potential metallicity bias becomes less important in comparison to the overall galaxy population .",
    "indeed the presence of a reasonable fraction of the nine hosts of unknown redshift in this range would reduce this lack of bright hosts , though not entirely to the level of consistency with an sfr weighted lbg lf .",
    "thus it would seem that at both high and low redshift , tough supports the idea that grbs are preferentially found in low - metallicity , relatively uv faint hosts compared to the overall galaxy population , and therefore their relationship to the cosmic sfr density history as measured by uv flux limited surveys is not simple .",
    "several previous studies have pointed to the numbers of grbs observed at high redshift indicating a large amount of hidden ( massive ) star formation in galaxies that are too faint to be detected in current lbg surveys @xcite .    alternatively others have suggested that grb production efficiency with respect to star formation may increase with redshift @xcite .",
    "if this latter alternative of increased grb efficiency were the sole reason for the change however , one might expect to still see some bright hosts at high redshift .",
    "however , highly star - forming galaxies may well also contain a large amount of dust , both obscuring their intrinsic sfr and making it more difficult to obtain spectroscopic redshifts . despite targeted and deep searches ,",
    "no grb host has yet been detected beyond @xmath47 , which lends support to the lack of bright hosts at high redshift not being an artifact of our survey . obviously since high-@xmath0 grbs are rare , the influence of small number statistics can not be avoided .",
    "we suggest however , that though an increase in grb production efficiency with respect to the uv measured cosmic sfr density at high redshift may be a useful calculational tool in simulation studies , it does not represent the detailed picture regarding individual grb host galaxies , and more unbiased grb host data are required .    during the review process of this paper ,",
    "other workers have submitted investigations of the properties of grb host galaxies .",
    "@xcite presented discussions of the properties of a _ heterogeneous _ sample of grb hosts at @xmath4 , and @xcite presented findings on the nir luminosity distribution @xmath6 to @xmath48 from the optically unbiased _ swift _",
    "gamma - ray burst host galaxy legacy survey ( shoals ; @xcite ) .",
    "while the former study concludes that grbs are unbiased tracers of star formation ( compare our section [ sec : selection_effects ] and figure [ fig : cdf2 ] ) , the latter study comes to a similar conclusion to that presented in this paper : grb hosts in general appear fainter than a model that solely depends on sfr would predict , with a particularly pronounced lack of nir luminous galaxies at @xmath49 . in all three samples ,",
    "the number of events at @xmath50 is relatively small , illustrating the need for a more concerted observational effort targeting this regime .",
    "we have used the optically - unbiased tough sample to examine the uv grb host galaxy lf from @xmath1 to @xmath51 .",
    "we find the tough host lf to be most compatible at all redshifts with an sfr weighted lf derived from a model containing both a metal - independent ( binary progenitor ) and metal - dependent ( single star collapsar ) channel with a relatively high level of bias toward low - metallicity hosts as suggested in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this is particularly the case at low ( @xmath52 ) and high ( @xmath26 ) redshifts , though we can not rule out an unbiased lf at medium redshifts ( @xmath3 ) as observed in more heterogeneous samples with unknown observational biases .    at high redshifts ( @xmath53 ) in particular , the lack of detected uv luminous host galaxies combined with the likelihood that several ( if not all ) of the nine hosts of unknown redshifts may be in this range show that a deep spectroscopic survey with an optical+nir spectrograph such as the eso x - shooter uv  nir echellete spectrograph is needed to fully constrain the grb host lf and elucidate more fully the relationship between grbs and the cosmic sfr density history .",
