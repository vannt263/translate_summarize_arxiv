    "entanglement entropy of many body systems has been a very useful tool and a fundamental concept in the last three decades in the vast majority of areas of research in physics .",
    "it has been studied in the context of free field theories @xcite , conformal field theories @xcite , holographic theories @xcite , integrable models @xcite and many other branches of the condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "it is a useful concept to classify field theories , especially the massless conformal field theories and ultimately it can be used to extract a lot of information regarding the universality class of the critical systems .",
    "it is now well - known that the bipartite entanglement entropy of the ground states of the quantum systems follow the area - law @xcite , for review see @xcite . the most famous exception to this law appears in the critical @xmath0 dimensional systems .",
    "the bipartite entanglement entropy of the ground state of an infinite critical chain has a logarithmic behaviour with respect to the size of the subsystem with a coefficient which is dependent on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "this behavior opened a new way to classify the universality classes of systems at and near quantum critical points using entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "since the bipartite entanglement entropy of the ground state of the system does not determine the universality class uniquely , there has been an intense research to calculate quantities like the entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals @xcite and the entanglement entropy of excited states @xcite . although the bipartite entanglement entropy of the ground state of the quantum chains has been studied thoroughly there are not many studies regarding tripartite systems .",
    "there are few entanglement measures for tripartite systems , such as negativity @xcite and localizable entanglement @xcite .",
    "negativity has recently been the subject of intense studies in the context of many body systems @xcite and references therein . however , as we will comment in the next section , because of the nature of the definition of the localizable entanglement it has been very difficult to make progress in that direction .",
    "recently , we introduced a new setup for tripartite systems which is although intimately related to the localizable entanglement it has the advantage of being calculable @xcite .",
    "the setup which will be further elaborated in the next section is as follows : take a many body entangled state and make a partial projective measurement of an observable in part of the system .",
    "after the measurement that part of the system is decoupled from the rest of the system , however , the remaining part still has an entangled state .",
    "when the result of the measurement is known the final state is a pure state and we call the measurement `` selective measurement '' . when the result of the measurement is not known the final state is a mixed state and we call the process `` non - selective measurement '' .",
    "the goal is the investigation of the bipartite entanglement entropy in the remaining state .    in @xcite , we studied the post measurement entanglement entropy after selective measurement in the @xmath0 dimensional conformal field theories .",
    "it was argued that one can use the conformal field theory techniques as far as one does the measurement in particular bases , so - called `` conformal bases '' .",
    "the conformal bases have been studied intensely in recent years in the context of shannon information @xcite and formation probabilities @xcite .",
    "the important result of these studies is that there are some bases that if one makes the measurement in those bases the final system has a boundary which is conformally invariant and so one can use the techniques of boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) to calculate the entanglement entropy .",
    "the technique used in @xcite was based on the well - known method of twist operators introduced in @xcite . however , this technique is not much useful in those cases that after the projective measurement the two parts of the remaining region are completely decoupled . in @xcite",
    "we introduced a new method of calculation of the entanglement entropy which has a close connection to the casimir energy of floating objects .",
    "the idea was inspired by the earlier works on the entanglement entropy @xcite and the casimir energy of floating objects @xcite .",
    "the method suggests that the rnyi entropy can be considered as the ratio of the casimir energy of two floating objects on the reimann surfaces .",
    "although this connection might have some deep consequences in the study of the entanglement entropy of field theories in this paper we focus on its practical use in calculating the post measurement entanglement entropy in conformal and massive quantum field theories .",
    "the effect of the measurement on the area - law in higher dimensions has been also studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the post measurement entanglement entropy setup has found recently many interesting applications in the study of quantum teleportation in holography @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the results of @xcite and @xcite in few more directions . in the next section ,",
    "we first define the setup and fix some notations . in section  3 ,",
    "we first review the method introduced in @xcite . using this method",
    "we find the post measurement entanglement entropy in different situations such as , semi - infinite system and finite temperature .",
    "we also study the affleck - ludwig boundary entropy .",
    "we then provide the entanglement hamiltonian of the post measurement systems in different cases and finally , we discuss post measurement entanglement spectrum and entanglement gaps . in section  4 , we make some predictions regarding post measurement entanglement entropy in massive systems . most of the results in this section are based on physical arguments and not some concrete mathematical calculations . in section  5 , we provide an efficient method to calculate the post measurement entanglement entropy in free fermions .",
    "although the method can be used in any dimension in this paper we focus on just @xmath0 dimension .",
    "the rest of the article is almost exclusively dedicated to the numerical study of the post measurement entanglement entropy in the well - known xy chain .",
    "the xy - chain provides a perfect laboratory to check numerically the cft formulas derived in the earlier sections . in section  6 ,",
    "we provide all the necessary ingredients regarding xy chain including the partition functions on the annulus and the conformal bases and the conformal configurations . in section  7 , we study throughly the post measurement entanglement entropy in the critical transverse field ising chain as an especial limit of the xy - chain .",
    "then in section  8 , we focus on the critical xx - chain .",
    "the reason that we dedicate two separate sections for these two models will be clear throughout the paper . in section  9",
    ", we numerically study the gapped ising chain . in section  10",
    ", we will study numerically the effect of the finite temperature on the post measurement entanglement entropy . in the section  11",
    "we will briefly comment on the possible experimental setup to study the post measurement entanglement entropy .",
    "finally , in the last section , we will conclude the paper with some general remarks about the results and future directions .",
    "consider a quantum system in a generic dimension and divide the system into two subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the von neumann entanglement entropy of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath2 is defined as follows : @xmath3=-\\tr\\rho_d\\ln\\rho_d,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "there is a generalization of the von neumann entanglement entropy called rnyi entropy and is defined as @xmath5=\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\ln\\tr\\rho_d^{\\alpha}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the limit @xmath6 gives back the von neumann entropy .",
    "note that when there is no danger of confusion , we replace @xmath7 $ ] with @xmath8 .",
    "the setup of our problem is as follows : consider a quantum system in its ground state and then choose an observable . finally , make local projective measurements of the chosen observable in a subsystem @xmath9 of the total system .",
    "note that @xmath9 does not need to be a simply connected domain .",
    "after partial projective measurement , the subsystem @xmath9 gets disentangled from its complement @xmath10 .",
    "however , the subsystem @xmath10 has a state which is in principle entangled . if after the projective measurement we know the outcome then the post measurement state will be a pure state which can have a definite wave function . in this case",
    ", we call the procedure `` selective measurement ''",
    ". however , it is quite possible that after partial projective measurement we do not know exactly the outcome of the measurement . in this case",
    ", the system can have different wave functions with different probabilities .",
    "in other words @xmath11=\\sum p_i |\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle \\psi_i|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the probability of collapsing to the wave function @xmath13 .",
    "the system is in a mixed state and we call the procedure `` non - selective measurement '' .",
    "now divide the subsystem @xmath10 to two new subsystems @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath14 and @xmath15 do not need to be connected to each other .",
    "we are interested in the entanglement entropy between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "when the measurement is selective one is left with a pure state and so one can use von neumann entanglement entropy as the entanglement measure as before .",
    "however , in the case of non - selective measurement , the situation is more complicated .",
    "although still , the von neumann entropy is an interesting quantity to calculate it is not a measure of entanglement .",
    "there are a few entanglement measures for mixed states , such as entanglement witnesses , partial transposition and negativity @xcite , however , they are all difficult quantities to calculate . for the non - selective measurement it is possible to show that @xmath16=\\tr_a\\rho_{ns}[\\bar{a}]=\\tr_a\\rho\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the initial density matrix of the total system .",
    "note that @xmath18 $ ] is a mixed state and for the cfts its entanglement content is already studied in the context of the entanglement negatvity in @xcite .",
    "the setup defined above is reminiscent of a concept called localizable entanglement , see @xcite .",
    "it is a useful quantity when one is interested in a tripartite system as our setup .",
    "the localizable entanglement between the two parts @xmath14 and @xmath15 after doing local projective measurement in the rest of the system @xmath9 is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the set of all possible outcomes @xmath21 of the measurements and @xmath22 is the chosen entanglement measure .",
    "the maximization is done with respect to all the possible observables to make the quantity independent of the observable .",
    "because of the maximization over all the possible measurements , the localizable entanglement is a very difficult quantity to calculate .",
    "note that in our setup we take @xmath23 to be the von neumann or the rnyi entropy and in principle , we calculate just @xmath24 for just one observable . consequently knowing @xmath12 in our setup can in principle",
    "provide a lower - bound for the localizable entanglement .",
    "a complete discussion about this point will appear in a future work @xcite .",
    "the rnyi entropy in the euclidean languge can be derived as @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the partition function of the system on @xmath27-sheeted surfaces .",
    "if the short - range interacting system is at the critical point , then it is expected that one can replace @xmath26 of the discrete critical system with the partition function of the cft on the @xmath27-sheeted riemann surfaces . then using the cft techniques one can calculate the entanglement entropy exactly @xcite . as we already stated before ,",
    "the bipartite von neumann and rnyi entropies after partial projective measurements are dependent on both the basis ( observable ) that one chooses to perform the measurement and also to the outcome of the measurement .",
    "after partial measurement , the @xmath9 part of the system decouples and one is left with the @xmath10 part . in the euclidean language , one can still use the equation ( [ reimann surfaces ] ) but with a slit on the @xmath9 part . depending on the chosen basis for",
    "the measurement and the outcome of the measurement the boundary condition on the slit can be different .",
    "consider that the chosen basis and the outcome of the measurement are in a way that the induced boundary condition on the slit is conformally invariant . in this particular case ,",
    "which as we will comment with more detail later is a very frequent scenario for quantum critical chains @xcite , one can use cft techniques to calculate the equation ( [ reimann surfaces ] ) . since these particular bases do not destroy the conformal structure of the system we will call them conformal bases . in these particular circumstances",
    "interestingly one can even go further and calculate the probability of occurrence of particular configuration as the result of the projective measurement @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this point when we discuss localizable entanglement @xcite . in the following sections we will first summarize the results of @xcite and @xcite for the infinite and the periodic systems . then using the same method as @xcite we will derive the formula for the post measurement entanglement entropy for the open systems .",
    "after presenting the formulas for the post measurement entanglement entropy in different conditions we will comment on the entanglement gaps and entanglement hamiltonians .

    "we leave the proper treatment of this case to a future work .      in this subsection , we make some further comments regarding the affleck - ludwig boundary entropy term .",
    "so far we have been concentrating on the projective measurements in a way that the measurement on the two slits are done on the same observables and the results are also the same .",
    "however , the more general case is when the measurements are done on different observables or they are done on the same observables but with different outcomes .",
    "depending on the observables and the outcomes the boundary conditions on the two slits might be different .",
    "note that even choosing the same observable on both slits does not mean that the corresponding boundary conditions on the two slits are the same . when there are two different conditions on the boundaries of the annulus , i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath14 , the equations ( [ annulus part1 ] ) and ( [ annulus part2 ] ) have the following more general forms @xcite : @xmath139-c\\frac{h}{12\\alpha},\\\\ \\label{annulus part4 } \\ln z^{annu}_{\\alpha}(\\tilde{q})&=&\\ln [ \\tilde{q}_{\\alpha}^{-c/24}(b^{a}_{0}b^b_{0}+\\sum_jb^{a}_{j}b^b_{j}\\tilde{q}_{\\alpha}^{\\delta_j})]-c\\frac{h}{12\\alpha},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 are the non - negative integers and @xmath141 and @xmath142 . @xmath143 and @xmath144 are cardy and ishibashi states respectively .",

    "the above result is correct also in the presence of the boundary , for example in the case of the semi - infinite system .",
    "note that since all of the derived formulas have also an extra non - universal constant contributions all the comments regarding the affleck - ludwig term is meaningless if we do not factor out the unwanted non - universal terms .",
    "this can be done following @xcite as follows : we first write the entanglement entropy of a region without any measurement domain for a periodic system as follows :    @xmath149    then for the case with the measurement we have @xmath150 with the above procedure , the definition of the @xmath151 has no ambiguity .",
    "note that in both equations the @xmath152 is the same non - universal constant and we also introduced a factor of @xmath153 inside the logarithm in the second equation . at the moment we have no concrete argument why that factor should be  4 but as we will see in the upcoming sections its presence",
    "is dictated by the numerical calculations .",
    "one way to see that a non - trivial factor should be there is just by realizing that the ultra - violet cut - off is different in the two cases .",
    "however to fix the number exactly one possibly needs to start from the massive case and go to the massless regime as it was argued in @xcite .",
    "the result for the infinite chain can be derived by just sending @xmath62 to infinity .",
    "a similar result is also valid in the presence of the natural boundary of the system .",

    "when we have a finite temperature infinite size critical system the corresponding formula for the post measurement rnyi entropy is @xmath155 finally , for semi - infinite system at finite temperature we have @xmath156 since the affleck - ludwig term is dependent on the corresponding boundary conditions one can use it to identify the nature of the conformal boundary condition .",
    "we will use extensively this fact to identify the boundary conditions induced by the configurations in the later sections .",
    "it is worth mentioning that all of the above equations will change if the boundary condition changing operators are present in the system .    in all of the above equations",
    ", we assumed that one of the measurement regions is big and the other one is very small ( or effectively does not exist ) in a way that @xmath47 is small .",
    "however , it is obvious that the situation would change if both of the measurement regions are big enough . in this case",
    ", one needs to consider the most general formulas of @xmath157 and @xmath158 and try to extract the universal @xmath159 terms . in this case",
    ", one might be even able to go further and detect all of the @xmath43 with @xmath160 .",
    "however , since @xmath161 in the partition function expansion is accompanied with non - universal constants it might be really hard to detect them numerically .",
    "finally , we close this subsection with some remarks regarding the @xmath162-theorem which states that for a fixed bulk conformal theory , boundary conditions introduce the @xmath56 in a way that @xmath159 decreases to the infrared under the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "this theorem is proved in a field theory context but there is no proof of it in the context of the entanglement entropy , see @xcite . in the context of the post measurement entanglement entropy",
    ", there might be two ways to look at this theorem . the important point about g - theorem",
    "is that the bulk theory is conformal but the boundary is flowing .",
    "this means that whatever measurement which induces non - conformal boundary condition can lead to different value for the @xmath159 .",
    "basically , a measurement of different outcomes might lead to the same or different conformal ( non - conformal ) boundary conditions .",
    "this means that one might derive different values for @xmath159 depending on the outcome of the measurement . of course",
    ", the same argument goes for also the post measurement entanglement entropy done in the other basis .",
    "the bottom line is that one might interpret different results for the measurement or doing the measurement in different basis as some sort of boundary renormalization group flow .",
    "we leave a more elaborate analysis of this point for a future work .      in this section",
    "we briefly address the effect of the lattice on the cft results .",
    "the effect in the presence of one slit is already studied in @xcite and here we apply the results to the post measurement entanglement entropy . as it is argued in @xcite the effect of the lattice",
    "can be simulated by perturbing the cft action by the energy momentum tensor as follows : @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the element of the energy - momentum tensor in the @xmath165 direction and @xmath166 is called extrapolation length and it usually plays the role of the uv cutoff in the presence of the boundary . to study the effect of the above perturbation on the post measurement entanglement",
    "entropy it is much easier to work with the twist operator technique . here",
    "we discuss the simplest setup of an infinite chain with one slit , in other words in the figure  1 we take @xmath167 .",
    "based on the calabrese - cardy technique @xcite the entanglement entropy of the region @xmath14 is given by @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the twist operator with the conformal weight @xmath170 sitting at the bundary between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "finally @xmath171 is the expectation value of the twist operator in the geometry of infinite plane minus a slit which can be calculated by mapping the whole space minus a slit to the upper half plane by the conformal map @xmath172 , see @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the effect of the perturbation ( [ perturbation ] ) on the one point function of an arbitrary primary operator is studied . applying the result to the twist operators for fixed @xmath173 we have @xmath174 the entanglement entropy",
    "can now be calculated by pluging ( [ twist - correction ] ) into ( [ twist1 ] ) .",
    "for example , for the von neumann entanglement entropy we find @xmath175 where the first term is the usual term appeared already in the section ( 3.1.1 ) and the second term is the @xmath176 correction coming from the lattice effects .",
    "although in many numerical calculations these kinds of lattice corrections to the cft results are the leading corrections , since in our numerical calculations we are going to investigate just the leading term we will not explore further this interesting effect .",
    "the entanglement hamiltonian which is also called modular hamiltonian @xmath177 is defined as follows : @xmath178 where @xmath179 is as before the reduced density matrix of the subsystem . to calculate @xmath177 we recall the partition function of cft on the cylinder @xmath180 which has the following form : @xmath181 using the definition of @xmath107 and the relation between @xmath182 and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath183 one",
    "can simply write @xcite @xmath184 where @xmath57 is the length of the cylinder with the base - circumference @xmath185 . having the above result on the cylinder one just needs to come back to the original geometry that has two slits on it .",

    "after moving to the annulus we can now use just the inverse of the conformal maps that we introduced before to map the annulus to the geometry with the two slits stretched on the intervals @xmath188 and @xmath189 . since after the conformal map @xmath190 the energy - momentum tensor changes as @xmath191 one can finally write @xmath192 having the above formula one can simply identify the modular hamiltonian as @xmath193 it is common to call the space dependent coefficient of the energy - momentum tensor the inverse of the temperature @xmath194 . in other words",
    "we have : @xmath195 the formula ( [ modular hamiltonian ] ) is valid for all the cases that we studied so far .",
    "one just needs to calculate the derivative of @xmath196 with respect to @xmath28 and plug it into the above formula . in the next subsections , we will list the entanglement hamiltonian of few interesting cases such as the infinite system , finite periodic system and finite temperature .",

    "it is very interesting to note that one can now derive the entanglement entropy by integrating the equilibrium thermal entropy per unite length as follows @xcite : @xmath209 putting ( [ eh2 ] ) in the above formula and expanding it with respect to @xmath36 one can derive the leading term of the equation ( [ rajab2015 ] ) . note that the subleading terms that are unusual corrections coming from the relevant operators sitting on the conical singularities @xcite can not be derived by using ( [ s and beta ] ) .",
    "this is simply because this equation does not take into account the contributions coming from the two very ends of the subsystem .",
    "finally , when @xmath59 we first make a change of coordinates @xmath210 and put also @xmath205 then we expand the equation ( [ beta - infinite ] ) for large @xmath71 .",

    "it is important to mention that in the above limit although strictly speaking the @xmath107 is not the small parameter we used the expansion of the partition function with respect to @xmath107 to derive the above formula .",

    "we follow the method of @xcite .",
    "first of all , we note that in the most general case one can write @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix .",
    "we first note that when the two regions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are connected the leading term of the above formula comes from the geometric part of the partition function . however , the subleading terms come from the annulus part and one needs to use the expansion with respect to @xmath107 .",
    "another crucial point is that for the connected cases @xmath36 or @xmath37 is always in the order of lattice spacing which means that for sufficiently small or big @xmath27 s one can use the extracted formulas .",

    "this was simply because since projective measurement in part of the system in the massive field theories does not change the value of the correlations in the other parts of the system one naturally expects that the only effect of the measurement region be producing a boundary condition in that part of the system which can just affect the value of @xmath251 and nothing more .",

    "the above equation means that for positive @xmath383 the smallest scaling dimension is @xmath384 the above scaling dimensions will frequently appear in our later numerical calculations .",
    "it has been already shown that the all spins up and all spins down configurations , i.e. * a * and * b * , do not lead to conformal boundary conditions , see for example @xcite .",
    "this is possible because the xx chain has a @xmath358 symmetry which keeps the number of fermions fixed .",
    "to have all the spins up one needs to inject fermions which are in contrast with the @xmath358 symmetry .",
    "however , the antiferromagnetic configuration , i.e. * c * , leads to a conformal boundary condition if one works with the half - filling case , see @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for an infinite system with the fermi momentum @xmath385 just the configurations with @xmath386 flow to conformal boundary conditions .",
    "in addition based on the numerical results of @xcite one can conjecture that the corresponding boundary conditions are all dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we argued in the above that all the configurations @xmath387 flow to dirichlet boundary conditions but a priory it is not clear what is the value of @xmath382 on the boundary for different configurations .",
    "if one takes similar configurations on the two slits one is left with @xmath388 and consequently the smallest scaling dimension in the spectrum is @xmath354 .",
    "however , if the configurations on the two slits are different one expect to find non - zero @xmath383 which means a different spectrum for the system .",
    "our cft results suggest that the post measurement entanglement entropy changes like a power - law with an exponent which depends on the smallest scaling dimension present in the system .",
    "this means that one can find @xmath383 corresponding to dirichlet boundary conditions by studying the post measurement entanglement entropy .",
    "note that since different values of @xmath383 can lead to the same @xmath54 the value of @xmath383 can not be fixed uniquely . in principle , we have @xmath389 or @xmath390 .",
    "the two different @xmath383 s although lead to the same smallest scaling dimension they have different partition functions . to fix the total spectrum of the system with a dirichlet boundary condition one needs to also extract the second smallest scaling dimension . in this work",
    ", we will concentrate on the smallest scaling dimension and leave the corrections to future studies .",
    "the conclusion of the above argument is that the post measurement entanglement entropy provides a method to characterize the conformal boundary conditions .",
    "we will study in the next sections many different configurations based on the above idea .",
    "it is worth mentioning that one can also extract similar results using the formation probabilities , see @xcite .",

    "finally , it is worth mentioning that all of the above results are valid if we make the projective measurement in the @xmath311 basis .",
    "when the measurement is done in the @xmath329-basis it is expected that the boundary flows to a conformal neumann boundary condition .",

    "then turn - off the interactions between the particles ( for example spins ) . choose a conformal observable ( basis ) and with an external field force the desired conformal configuration in the subsystem @xmath9 .",
    "for example , in the spin chains this can be done by a magnetic field acting on the spins in the particular directions .",
    "the final wave function of @xmath10 is the desired post measurement wave function .",
    "then one can try to study the bipartite entanglement entropy of this wave function by one of many different methods that have been introduced recently , see @xcite .",
    "notice that in the above procedure it is important to turn - off the interactions after preparing the system in the ground state .",
    "this method can be obviously used to prepare many body entangled states that are spatially disconnected .",
    "in this paper we studied different aspects of the post measurement entanglement entropy in the critical and the non - critical quantum chains .",
    "we first derived different formulas for the post measurement entanglement entropy in the conformal field theories .",
    "we studied systems with boundaries and also conformal field theories at the finite temperature .",
    "in addition , we studied the role of the boundary entropy in the post measurement entanglement entropy .",
    "some exact results were also presented for the entanglement hamiltonian and the distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices . based on some physical arguments we also presented some predictions regarding the post measurement entanglement entropy in the massive systems .",
    "the above analytical results are in principle valid for all the projective measurements that respect the conformal symmetry of the bulk . however , in reality one needs to check what bases and configurations respect this symmetry in actual discrete models . to check the validity of our results we first provided a method to study the post measurement entanglement entropy in the generic free fermion models .",
    "the method is based on grassmann variables and can be used in any dimension .",
    "we then used the technique to study the post measurement entanglement entropy in the xy - chain .",
    "in particular , we studied the transvese field ising chain and the xx - chain . because of the presence of the @xmath358 symmetry in the xx - chain the model is strikingly different from the ising chain .",
    "many subtilities appear during the study of the discrete models which makes the applications of the cft formulas to the discrete models very tricky .",
    "these subtilities encourage further analytical and numerical calculations on the discrete models . in particular ,",
    "it is very imporatnt to study the effect of the basis of the measurement on the post measurement entanglement entropy in different discrete models . concerning the massive systems all of our results",
    "were based on huristic arguments some analytical results and further numerical calculations are surely necessary to put the results on the firm ground . in particular , calculations based on boundary integrable models can in principle shed light in this direction .",
    "most of the results presented in this paper can be more or less strightforwardly generalized to higher dimensions @xcite we leave more throuh analysis to a future work .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the method used in this paper to calculate the post measurement entanglment entropy has a very intimte connection to the casimir energy of floating objects on the reimann surfaces . in other words",
    "one can calculate the entanglement entropy by knowing the casimir energy .",
    "since the reverse is not true it is quite encouraging to think more seriously about the many implications that this approach might have in the fundamental level .",

    "in this appendix we list the conformal maps derived in the @xcite .",
    "their exact form is needed to derive the entanglement hamiltonians .      the conformal map from the plane with two slits on a line with lengths @xmath36 and @xmath37 and a branch cut with the length @xmath30 to an annulus with the inner and outer radiuses @xmath487 and @xmath488 with @xmath489 has the following form :                        with the @xmath202 given by @xmath498\\sin[\\frac{\\pi s_2}{l}]-\\sqrt{\\sin[\\frac{\\pi s_1}{l}]\\sin[\\frac{\\pi s_2}{l}]\\sin[\\frac{\\pi ( s_1+l)}{l } ] \\sin[\\frac{\\pi ( s_2+l)}{l}]}}{\\sin[\\frac{\\pi l}{l}]\\sin[\\frac{\\pi ( l+s_1+s_2)}{l}]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then geometric part of the partition function can be derived as @xmath499 with          when the system is infinite but at finite temperature the slits are in the direction of the axes of the cylinder .",
