    "protective measurement @xcite is a scheme for measuring expectation values of a quantum system in a way that makes this state disturbance arbitrarily small .",
    "for such a measurement to obtain , the system is coupled weakly to the apparatus , and the initial state of the system is required to be in a nondegenerate eigenstate of its hamiltonian . neither the initial state nor the hamiltonian need to be known .",
    "besides being an important and unusual instance of a quantum measurement , protective measurement offers the possibility of successively carrying out measurements of expectation values of different observables while the system is likely to remain in its initial quantum state .",
    "this state may then be reconstructed from the measured expectation values with in principle arbitrarily high fidelity @xcite . in this way",
    ", protective measurement may provide a route toward state tomography of single quantum systems .",
    "two essential aspects of protective measurement remain insufficiently studied .",
    "the first is to actually quantify the state disturbance , rather than to simply consider the idealization of an infinitely weak and infinitely long measurement interaction , for which no state disturbance occurs .",
    "the second is to study concrete models for implementing protective measurements . in particular",
    ", what has not yet been done is to study the issue of state disturbance in the context of such a model , so one can better understand the physics and parameter choices that would need to go into an experiment realizing a protective measurement with minimal state disturbance .",
    "our paper addresses this open problem .    specifically , we consider the protective measurement of the state of a spin-@xmath0 particle by an inhomogeneous magnetic field using a stern  gerlach - like setup .",
    "this paradigmatic and experimentally relevant model was first studied in refs .",

    ", we revisit this model but develop a significantly more general account of it that allows us to precisely quantify the amount of state disturbance as a function of the relevant physical parameters . given the importance of two - level systems ( qubits ) in quantum mechanics and quantum information processing , our model is of great theoretical and practical interest . because the model is exactly solvable , we can also use it as a tool for assessing the accuracy of approximate and perturbative solutions that are needed to treat most other models of protective measurement . by applying a recently developed perturbative approach @xcite",
    ", we are also able to explore how time - dependent couplings between system and apparatus help reduce the state disturbance .",
    "the main result of our paper is the derivation of both exact and approximate expressions for the state disturbance predicted by the model .",
    "this has direct physical implications , because it allows us to estimate the values of the magnetic - field parameters that would be required to implement a protective measurement that has a suitably low probability of disturbing the initial state .",
    "we also show that multiple simultaneous protective measurements do not result in smaller cumulative state disturbance when compared to a successive implementation of these measurements .",

    "these phase factors describe rapid oscillations as a function of @xmath7 and can therefore be considered experimentally irrelevant in the same way as we have disregarded the oscillations of the sinc function .",
    "thus , we have confirmed that successive and simultaneous protective measurements introduce identical amounts of state disturbance in our model .",
    "finally , let us explore a hitherto overlooked caveat of protective measurement : even if no state disturbance occurs , the measured direction of the momentum shift may be reversed , resulting in a reconstructed state that can differ drastically from the initial state .",

    "using that @xmath167 the probability for a measurement of the particle s momentum shift to yield the incorrect value @xmath168 conditional on the system s being found in the state @xmath51 is , to lowest order in @xmath71 , @xmath169 because this probability is of order @xmath170 , it is typically negligible . the fact that the probability amplitude corresponding to eq .",
    "is of order @xmath95 explains why it was missed not only in the zeroth - order limit of infinitely large @xmath7 , but also in the first - order treatment of refs .",
    "@xcite .",

    "the corresponding density matrix reconstructed from the three protective measurements of @xmath171 would then be @xmath176 rather than @xmath177 , where @xmath42 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath174 . the pure state corresponding to eq .",
    "is @xmath178 .",
    "for example , if @xmath84 , then @xmath179 , an equal - weight superposition of @xmath51 and @xmath56 .",
    "the functional dependence of the fidelity @xmath180 may be understood as follows . if @xmath181 , then the failed measurement is in the direction of the quantization axis of the initial spin state @xmath51 and indicates the expectation value @xmath182 associated with the state @xmath56 , while the expectation values of the protective measurements in the two orthogonal directions are zero .",
    "thus the conjunction of these three measurements would lead one to conclude that the system s state must be @xmath56 , and therefore the fidelity will be zero .",
    "conversely , if @xmath88 , then the expectation value of the protective measurement along this direction is zero , and thus a sign flip of this expectation value leaves the fidelity unaffected .",
    "physically realizable protective measurements inevitably disturb the initial state of the system , implying a nonzero probability for the measurement to fail .",
    "fundamentally , this disturbance is rooted in the tradeoff between quantum - state disturbance and information gain in a quantum measurement @xcite , as well as in the fact that the maximum possible information gain does not depend on the particular implementation of the quantum measurement @xcite . to determine the likelihood of success of a protective measurement and the fidelity of quantum - state reconstruction based on protective measurements , one needs to be able to quantify the state disturbance , as well as the faithfulness of the measurement outcome .    in this paper",
    "we have analyzed these issues in the context of a concrete model that may be experimentally realizable using a setup of the stern  gerlach type . while this model has been used previously @xcite to illustrate basic features of protective measurement , the essential issues studied in this paper had not yet been considered .",
    "one of our main results is that if the strength of the weak inhomogeneous magnetic field producing the measurement interaction does not vary in time during the measurement interval , then the amount of disturbance of the initial state is completely quantified by two parameters .",
    "the first parameter is the ratio between the measurement field and the strong uniform magnetic field providing the protection of the initial state .",
    "the second parameter is the angle between the unknown direction of the protection field and the experimentally chosen direction of the measurement field .",
    "we found that the transition probability shows , to good approximation , a quadratic dependence on the field - strength parameter and a sinusoidal dependence on the angle parameter .",
    "thus , weakening the measurement field reduces the state disturbance , despite the fact that the measurement time @xmath7 is simultaneously increased by the same factor ( this is so because the measurement field is inversely proportional to @xmath7 ) .",
    "the increase of the state disturbance as a function of the angle parameter can be understood from the complementarity principle , since increasing the angle corresponds to measuring a spin component in a direction further away from the direction represented by the quantization axis of the initial spin state .",
    "the state disturbance can be reduced not only by decreasing the relative strength of the measurement field , but also by turning the field on and off in a gradual fashion , as was already shown more generally in ref .",
    "our results illustrate that such a gradual turn - on and turnoff accomplishes a much more effective reduction of the state disturbance than could be achieved by merely making the measurement field weaker .",
    "although it is in principle easy to realize any desired smooth time dependence of the measurement field by gradually changing the current in the electromagnet , the experimental challenge lies in appropriately timing the field such that it is gradually turned on just as the particle enters the measurement region .",
    "this also requires that only a single particle traverses the measurement field at any given time . among other measures , reaching",
    "the single - particle regime may require a suitably narrow collimating slit for minimizing the particle flux issuing from the source .    for a protective measurement to be successful",
    ", it needs to not only leave the system in its initial state at the conclusion of the measurement , but the shift of the apparatus pointer must also be a faithful representation of the expectation value of the measured observable in this initial state .",
    "our analysis shows that the issues of state disturbance and faithful pointer shift ( here realized as a momentum transfer ) are distinct and require individual attention . in particular , we found that even when the system is left in its initial state at the end of the measurement interaction , the measurement may still result in the wrong pointer shift ( albeit with a probability proportional to @xmath183 that is likely to be negligibly small in practice ) .",
    "this pointer shift corresponds to a change in the particle s momentum in the opposite direction from the direction associated with the expectation value of the measured spin component in the initial quantum state .",
    "as we have shown , such an error can have severe consequences for the fidelity of the quantum - state reconstruction .",
    "if one uses a measurement field that is inhomogeneous in all three directions in space , one can correspondingly impart a momentum shift with three distinct spatial components .",
    "measuring these components provides the same information as gained from successive protective measurements using three different ( nonphysical ) measurement fields that are inhomogeneous in only one direction .",
    "we showed that the resulting state disturbance is also the same , in agreement with what would one expect from the general relationship between information gain and disturbance in a quantum measurement .",
    "this suggests a more general result concerning protective measurements , namely , that multiple successive measurements are equivalent , both in terms of the resulting pointer shifts and the cumulative state disturbance , to carrying out the same measurements simultaneously .",
    "nonetheless , in a concrete experimental situation one of these two possible measurement procedures may be easier to realize .",
    "for example , in the spin measurement considered in this paper , a simultaneous implementation using a measurement field that is inhomogeneous in all three directions in space is not only the physically relevant case ( since the field must be divergence - free ) , but also makes it unnecessary to arrange three separate stern  gerlach apparatuses .    despite several promising theoretical proposals @xcite , the experimental realization of protective measurements is still an open challenge .",
    "our analysis indicates that an implementation of the measurement scheme studied in this paper may be within the parameter regime of existing stern  gerlach experiments , such as those based on a beam of evaporated potassium atoms .",
    "both the dimensions of the apparatus and the field inhomogeneities typically found in such experiments are suited for producing an appreciable , macroscopic pointer shift , although meeting the weak - measurement condition will require a sufficiently strong uniform magnetic field in the vicinity of . while a more careful estimate may need to include consideration of experimental imperfections and other factors , our aim here was to focus on the issue of state disturbance and to show how it constrains the experimental parameters .",
    "while the experimental challenges are considerable , our analysis suggests that an implementation of the measurement scheme studied here may well be feasible in the near future .",
