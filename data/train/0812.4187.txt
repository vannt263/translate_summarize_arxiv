    "<S> we have studied the reaction @xmath0 at recoil - free kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath1 meson possibly produced in this reaction would be thus almost at rest in the laboratory system and could therefore be bound with high probability , if nuclear @xmath1 states exist . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of such a state through the @xmath2 resonance would lead to a proton-@xmath3 pair emitted in opposite directions . for these conditions </S>",
    "<S> we find some indication of such a bound state </S>",
    "<S> . an upper limit of @xmath4 0.5 nb is found .    the study of @xmath5 and @xmath6 hypernuclei , which are nuclear bound systems of short - lived hadrons , has proved to be a very useful tool for gaining information about @xmath7 and @xmath8 interactions in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> also , studies of @xmath3- and @xmath9- atomic levels have provided useful information about @xmath10 and @xmath11 interactions in nuclei . however , there has never been , to the best of our knowledge , an observation of a neutral pseudoscalar meson bound strongly in the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> observation of such bound states would open new possibilities in nuclear and particle physics with respect to the structure of such nuclei , the @xmath12 coupling constant and the behavior of the s@xmath13 nucleon resonance in nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the pion - nucleon interaction , the @xmath1-nucleon interaction at small momenta is attractive and sufficiently strong . </S>",
    "<S> this attraction can be seen from the fact that the @xmath1 threshold ( 1488  mev ) is situated just below the @xmath2 resonance which couples strongly to the @xmath14 channel . </S>",
    "<S> initial calculations by bhalerao and liu @xcite obtained attractive s - wave @xmath14 scattering lengths @xmath15  fm and @xmath16  fm , using the @xmath10 phase shifts calculated by arndt and the cern theory group , respectively . with these phase shifts , haider and liu @xcite have shown that @xmath1 can be bound in nuclei with a @xmath17 10 . </S>",
    "<S> other groups have also found similar results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent analyses of the experimental data and different theoretical calculations predict a range of values for the @xmath14 scattering length from 0.2  fm to 1.0  fm for the real part , and from 0.2  fm to 0.35  fm for the imaginary part . </S>",
    "<S> the higher values for the real part of @xmath18 have led to speculations that the @xmath1-bound state might be possible even for lighter nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> an overview of this topic is given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been previous searches for the proposed @xmath1-mesic nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> first experiments searching for @xmath1-mesic nuclei at bnl @xcite and lampf @xcite by using a missing - mass technique in the ( @xmath19 ) reaction came to negative or inconclusive results . </S>",
    "<S> later it became clear that the peaks are not necessarily narrow and that a better strategy of searching for @xmath1-nuclei is required . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the bnl experiment was in a region far from the recoilless kinematics , in which the cross section is substantially reduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the existence of @xmath1-mesic @xmath20 was claimed to have been observed in the reaction @xmath21 using the photon beam at mami @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has , however , been pointed out @xcite that the data of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite does not permit an unambiguous determination of the existence of a @xmath22-bound state . </S>",
    "<S> the suggestion that @xmath22 is not bound is also supported by the theoretical studies of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the present experiment makes use of the transfer reaction @xmath23 the @xmath24he were measured at zero degrees with the magnetic spectrograph big karl @xcite by ray tracing in the focal plane with two packs of multi - wire chambers . </S>",
    "<S> this was followed by two hodoscope layers , separated by 4  m which provided an additional time - of - flight measurement . the beam momentum ( @xmath25 mev / c ) and the setting of the spectrograph were chosen such that for binding energies in the range 0 - 20  mev , the @xmath1 is produced almost at rest . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath24he spectrum is expected to be dominated by particles being emitted during the nuclear cascade process . in order to reduce this background a coincidence </S>",
    "<S> was required among @xmath24he and events produced through a second step @xmath26 because the overall @xmath27 system ( or @xmath28 ) is almost at rest , energy and momentum conservation require the two charged particles to be emitted back - to - back to each other with energies of @xmath4100  mev for the proton and @xmath4348  mev for the pion . </S>",
    "<S> such a clear pattern is smeared out by fermi motion resulting in a distribution around @xmath4150 @xmath29 with a width of 40@xmath29 . for the measurement of these particles a dedicated detector enstar </S>",
    "<S> was built , details of which are described in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , it consists of three cylindrical layers of scintillating material surrounding the target . </S>",
    "<S> each layer is divided into long bars thus allowing a measurement of the azimuthal emission angle . </S>",
    "<S> the bars of the middle layer are further divided along the length in order to measure the polar emission angle . while the protons of interest are stopped in the middle layer of the detector , </S>",
    "<S> pions pass through all layers giving only @xmath30 information .    although , some calculations predict @xmath31he to be large enough to bind @xmath1 mesons , garcia - recio et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite expect more medium mass nuclei ( a @xmath32 24 ) to show stronger binding . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , heavier nuclei will have broader states making them harder to detect on a smooth background . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the final nucleus should not have too many excited states , which is the case for even - even nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the ideal target should thus be odd - odd , but such a nucleus does not exist as a solid target so we were limited to an odd - even system . as a compromise among these different factors we choose @xmath33al . </S>",
    "<S> the target thickness of 1  mm , corresponding to a resolution of 2  mev , was chosen in order not to spoil the natural width of the bound state . </S>",
    "<S> two runs were performed with different spectrometer momentum settings ( p@xmath34 = 859  mev / c and 897  mev / c ) . </S>",
    "<S> an integrated luminosity of @xmath35  pb@xmath36 was accumulated for each run .    </S>",
    "<S> prior to the experiment , the enstar detector was calibrated as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . due to the high brilliance proton beam </S>",
    "<S> the experiment was performed with minimal background even though the @xmath37he were measured in the forward direction .     </S>",
    "<S> as function of the time - of - flight ( tof ) for particles in the focal plane area of the magnetic spectrograph.,width=8 ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pid ] the energy loss in the first hodoscope layer is shown as a function of the time - of - flight . </S>",
    "<S> different particle groups can be clearly identified . </S>",
    "<S> beam particles do not enter the focal plane because their charges differ by a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> this would not be the case in a deuteron induced reaction where break - up protons would flood the focal plane detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive @xmath37he spectra are uniformly distributed when the data are corrected for the acceptance of the spectrograph . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37he within the angles @xmath4 3@xmath29 in the vertical and @xmath4 0.6@xmath29 in the horizontal direction were recorded by the spectrograph focal plane detectors .    </S>",
    "<S> the coincidence required between the focal plane detectors and the enstar detector was achieved by measuring the time between the first hodoscope layer and one of the individual enstar elements . </S>",
    "<S> a peak - to - background ratio of 3.2:1 was obtained and the background was subtracted .    for the beam momenta used , the selection of @xmath37he means that the residual system is at rest with an excitation energy of @xmath4 550  mev . the only background which could give the same pattern as the @xmath28 decay would be a deuteron , stopping in the middle layer in association with a higher energy proton punching through all detectors . </S>",
    "<S> a gate was therefore put on pions on a @xmath38 spectrum for events going through all layers . with such geometrical selections </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the missing - mass spectra for the two spectrograph settings shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : be ] . </S>",
    "<S> the counts have been corrected for the acceptances of the spectrograph for the two settings . in order to minimize systematical uncertainties in areas of small acceptance , </S>",
    "<S> only the regions with acceptance 4@xmath39 around the central momentum value have been retained . </S>",
    "<S> this eliminated data in less than @xmath40 of the missing mass range . applying the cuts from enstar corresponding to </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 leads to reduction in yield by a factor of @xmath42 .     </S>",
    "<S> spectra measured in the magnetic spectrograph with two charged particles detected in the enstar detector , which show the decay pattern of an @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line indicates zero excitation energy of a @xmath43 system , i. e. binding is to the left of the line.,width=8 ]        positive values of the binding energy @xmath44 correspond to the free or unbound @xmath1 production . due to the large width of the @xmath28 resonance of 100 to 200  mev @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the yield should rise with phase space , while at the eta - mesic formation threshold it is expected to be zero . </S>",
    "<S> an indication of such a rise is somewhat seen in the data as demonstrated by the fitted polynomial shown in the insert of fig.[fig : binding - spectra ] , which gives a better @xmath45 value than the one that is obtained by a fit with a constant .    for both settings , there appears to be an enhancement from the threshold for @xmath43 which is -23.8145  gev to @xmath46  gev . </S>",
    "<S> one may attribute all the counts to background . </S>",
    "<S> however , background should be randomly distributed and hence it is very unlikely for two different measurements to show the same structure . </S>",
    "<S> we , therefore , conclude , the structures could be from the bound @xmath1 .    in order to elucidate this point </S>",
    "<S> further we discuss the spectra in more detail . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : binding - spectra ] we show the binding energy spectra combined for the two settings . since for both settings the same luminosity was acquired , the weighted arithmetic mean was used in overlap region . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows the data without the strong back - to - back correlation requirement ( upper panel ) and with the requirement ( lower panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> the unconstrained data do not show any structure and can be well described by a constant . </S>",
    "<S> for the data in the lower spectrum , the @xmath28 decay pattern is required . </S>",
    "<S> the counts are typically lower by an order of magnitude than that in the unconstrained case . </S>",
    "<S> although , the @xmath2 can also decay with two - pion emission , this branch is small compared to the @xmath47 channel @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the data show an enhancement around @xmath48  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of this structure is extracted according to the two methods given in refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively . at first </S>",
    "<S> , we test the hypothesis of peak structure being fluctuation of background , i.e. the origin of the background is taken to be independent of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> the background outside the peak region , for simplicity approximated by a constant , was found to be 5.8@xmath490.64 . </S>",
    "<S> the significance @xcite is then given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total counts in the region of interest , @xmath52 is the total background in this region as determined from the fit to the outside region and @xmath53 is error in the estimation of background value as taken from the fit . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a value of significance which is 5.3@xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> here we have assumed gaussian errors . </S>",
    "<S> for the assumption of poisson errors with asymmetric error bars ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : binding - spectra ] ) the background is 6.2@xmath491.0 . this larger value is typical for poisson distribution and hence the significance reduces to 4.9@xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> finally a gaussian on top of the background was fitted to the whole data set . </S>",
    "<S> this yielded for the case of poisson statistics 6.4@xmath490.96 for the background , 8.3@xmath493.6 for the amplitude , -12.0@xmath492.2  mev for the centroid and 4.7@xmath491.7  mev for the width . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding curves are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : binding - spectra ] . </S>",
    "<S> also a third order polynomial was fitted to the data . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting curves are also shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : binding - spectra ] .    in the second method , </S>",
    "<S> the statistical significance is extracted by assuming the background events as well as the peak events on top of the background being poisson distributed . </S>",
    "<S> again a constant background and a gaussian was assumed . </S>",
    "<S> a fit was performed using the maximum likelihood method . </S>",
    "<S> the significance is then defined as , @xmath55 . here , @xmath56 is the difference in the values of the logarithm likelihood function with signal fixed to zero and at the best fit value . in this way , we obtain a value of 6.20@xmath54 for the significance , assuming a simultaneous determination of amplitude , centroid and width of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> the fit gives for the linear background @xmath57 together with the values , for the signal amplitude @xmath58 , for the centroid @xmath59  mev and for the width @xmath60  mev corresponding to a fwhm of 10.22@xmath492.98  mev . </S>",
    "<S> these results compare favorably with those from the first method . </S>",
    "<S> we , therefore , consider the present experimental results to provide a strong hint of a nuclear @xmath1 bound state .    </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to give an upper bound for the cross section . with an estimated efficiency due to detector geometry and analysis selections of 0.70 @xmath49 0.07 we find @xmath54 = 0.152 @xmath49 0.054 ( stat ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 0.021 ( syst )  nb . </S>",
    "<S> if this  </S>",
    "<S> structure \" corresponds to a bound @xmath1 decaying via reaction ( eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> [ equ : step ] ) , the cross section would be 0.46 @xmath49 0.16 ( stat ) @xmath49 0.06 ( syst )  nb , assuming an isospin branching ratio of 1/3 . </S>",
    "<S> this cross section value can be compared with the  elementary \" @xmath61 reaction which , for the present beam energy has a cross section integrated over the spectrograph acceptance of @xmath62  b @xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the reaction @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath24he ions , which were detected at zero degrees with a magnetic spectrograph , carried the beam momentum ( recoilless kinematics ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining system has the mass @xmath64al@xmath65 with be the binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath66 system , measured with the enstar detector , decays almost back - to - back with energies corresponding to an @xmath2 at rest . </S>",
    "<S> the most probable scenario for the @xmath1 decay is through forming an in - medium @xmath28 resonance which decays into @xmath67 and @xmath3 . in this case , the remaining system is @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> although instead of an @xmath1 a pion could be produced in the intermediate step forming another @xmath28 nearby , which could lead to the back - to - back @xmath69 events . </S>",
    "<S> however , simple kinematical calculations show that this would require the momentum of a target nucleon to at least 210  mev / c for which the probability is very low . in two spectra , taken at different spectrograph settings , </S>",
    "<S> an enhancement was found for negative binding energies close to the free production threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly what is expected from the bound @xmath70 system </S>",
    "<S> . the enhancement may not be purely due to binding in the ground state only but also to an excited @xmath71 state . </S>",
    "<S> however , this requires pick up of more deeply lying nucleons which may be less likely than pick up of the least - bound nucleons . binding energy spectra without strong @xmath28 constraint </S>",
    "<S> do not show the enhancement . </S>"
