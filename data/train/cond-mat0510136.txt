    "apart from being the subject of intense experimental activity , granular gases are also a particularly fertile testing ground for new theoretical ideas and problems , especially within the field of nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "one such a problem is the role of entropy production as a lyapunov functional for nonequilibrium steady - states .",
    "this problem has its roots in the fifties , in the works of the brussels group around prigogine  @xcite on the minimum entropy production theorem .",
    "the limitations of this theorem , that relies essentially on the linear response formalism ( i.e. , has a domain of validity that is restricted to close - to - equilibrium situations ) , were rather clear already at that time , and a first extension to far - from - equilibrium situations was proposed under the form of the phenomenological  general evolution criterion \" of glansdorff and prigogine ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since then , there was steady effort , and a huge body of literature , in the search for a variational principle for steady - states that are arbitrarily far from equilibrium .",

    "an extension of jaynes maximum entropy inference principle ( maxent ) to nonequilibrium situations was proposed  @xcite , and illustrated recently on several examples  @xcite .",
    "the resulting picture is , however , rather confusing and sometimes even contradictory ( e.g. , some of the above - mentioned papers speak of a  maximum \" entropy production rate at stationarity , while others refer to a  minimum \" ) .",
    "one of the main difficulties of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is the scarcity of solvable models , on the basis of which one could , eventually , get some clarification on these controversial points .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to consider such a solvable model , namely a granular gas modeled as an assembly of inelastic hard - spheres with _ constant restitution coefficient _ , in which energy is injected by means of random forces acting independently upon the particles .",

    "one of the question is thus whether this model is also appropriate in describing _",

    "entropy variations are usually split into two parts : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the entropy production arising due to the dissipative processes that take place inside the system ( that is positively - defined according to the second principle of thermodynamics ) , while the entropy flux @xmath73 accounts for the external forces driving the system into a nonequilibrium state ( the related contribution is often reduced to boundary terms ) . the  art \" of phenomenological thermodynamics precisely bears on @xmath74 and on how to decompose it in terms of the energy , particle , momentum , chemical , _ etc .",

    "the fluxes are usually proportional to the conjugated affinities , with the onsager coefficients as proportionality factors , and one recovers prigogine s minimum theorem for @xmath75 under the hypothesis of time - reversibility of the underlying microscopic dynamics",
    ".    however , in view of the local character of the energy injection mechanism , as well as of the spatial homogeneity of the system , the situation is completely different in the case we are considering . indeed , unlike the above - mentioned `` conventional '' ness , there are neither macroscopic , however weak , currents running across the system , nor the related phenomenological onsager response coefficients .",
    "therefore , the separation into  source \" and  flow \" for the entropy variation is much more tricky .    _",
    "first approach. _ a first proposed choice of the  entropy production \" is @xmath76 the form of the first r.h.s .",
    "term being simply chosen by analogy with the elastic - limit case .",
    "the second term has been chosen by analogy with standard diffusion processes . in those processes",
    "this term vanishes at equilibrium because the gradients disappear .",
    "note however that here the diffusion process happens in the velocity space , and thus the vanishing of this term at equilibrium is not due to the system becoming homogeneous in @xmath77-space , but because of the energy source strength @xmath48 being tuned to @xmath78 .",
    "the above @xmath75 appears to be the sum of two positive definite terms , and it is therefore also positive definite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath75 can only be zero _ at equilibrium _ , namely when",
    "both the energy source ( the random kicks ) and the energy sink ( the dissipative collisions ) are tuned to zero . in that respect",
    ", it fulfills the properties expected from standard phenomenological thermodynamics .    on the other hand ,",

    "however , aside from conveying the shrinking of phase space volumes , we must dismiss @xmath86 as relevant candidates for extremum entropy functionals .",
    "indeed , in the spirit of phenomenological thermodynamics , the splitting of @xmath70 into @xmath75 and @xmath79 is motivated by the desire to isolate the driving processes ( the source and sink referred to above ) from the irreversible processes inside the system .",
    "however there is no simple and univoque manner to do so , and definitely this first choice is not accomplishing this physically - motivated requirement .",
    "it must be noted that the last term of eq.([sirr ] ) could have also chosen as a part of @xmath79 , which would then have featured both the source and the sink , at the price of abandoning its negative definiteness .    _",
    "second approach. _ we now propose an alternative and perhaps more pragmatic route , which consists in isolating as the only driving mechanism the random kicks provided by the thermostat .",
    "the inelastic collisions , viewed above as an energy sink , are now incorporated into a term describing the system s intrinsic dissipative microscopic dynamics . along those lines",
    "we henceforth write that @xmath87 the first contribution @xmath88 corresponds to the entropy production inside the system , i.e. , it comes from the changes of the particles velocities during the binary inelastic collisions , @xmath89 where we have used the shorthand notation @xmath90 for the distribution functions corresponding to the post - collisional velocities  ( [ resume42 ] ) .",
    "of course , in the limit of elastic collisions @xmath3 the expression of @xmath88 reduces to the usual positive - definite expression of the hard - disk gas that enters the @xmath0-theorem .",
