    "in the  @xmath17@xmath18 collider , beams collide at a center - of - mass energy @xmath19 .",
    "since 2001 , kloe has collected an integrated luminosity of 2.5 @xmath20 .",
    "results presented below are based on 2001 - 02 data for 450 @xmath5 .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber surrounded by a lead / scintillating - fiber electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "a superconducting coil around the calorimeter provides a 0.52  t field .",
    "the drift chamber  @xcite is 4  m  in diameter and 3.3  m  long .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath21 .",
    "two track vertices are reconstructed with a spatial resolution of @xmath22 3  mm .",
    "the calorimeter  @xcite composed of a barrel and two endcaps , covers 98% of the solid angle .",
    "energy and time resolution are @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the kloe trigger  @xcite uses calorimeter and drift chamber information . for the present analysis",
    "only the calorimeter signals are used .",
    "two energy deposits above threshold , @xmath25  me-.07em v  for the barrel and @xmath26  me-.07em v  for the endcaps , are required .",
    "the @xmath27 meson decays mainly into kaons : 49% to @xmath28@xmath29 and 34% to @xmath30-@xmath31 pairs .",
    "the identification of the @xmath28 automatically tags the presence of a @xmath29 ; the same holds with reversed charges . in kloe",
    "@xmath32 decays are tagged efficiently by the identification of a two body decay of one of the kaons . both @xmath3 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath34 )",
    "decays have been used for the measurements presented in this paper .",
    "the use of a tagging technique gives the possibility to perform absolute branching ratio measurements .",
    "the branching ratio of the signal decay can be extracted from : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the geometrical acceptance of the fiducial volume , and @xmath37 is the signal reconstruction and selection efficiency .",
    "@xmath37 is measured directly using the mc , and corrected for the different behaviors for data and mc of quantities involved in the measurement like the tracking efficiency or the single photon efficiency .    in principle , the capability of selecting a tag kaon does not depend on the decay mode of the other kaon .",
    "in fact the geometrical superimposition of the `` tag '' and `` signal '' part of the @xmath28@xmath29 event , and the fact that the trigger and the background rejection and tracking procedures look at the event globally , make the separation in two distinct hemispheres arbitrary . in short ,",
    "the @xmath32  tagging efficiency is not independent of the @xmath38   decay mode , and the tag bias has to be therefore carefully studied .",
    "the factor @xmath39 should be equal to 1 , if for each decay mode , @xmath40 , the efficiency , @xmath41.this is referred to as the tag bias and can be measured only using mc .",
    "the correction due to the different behaviors for data and mc of specific processes or sub - detectors has been measured in suitable dowscaled event samples .",
    "the measurement of the branching ratios for the @xmath32 semileptonic decays is performed using four data samples defined by different decay modes for the tagging kaon : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "this redundancy allows the systematic effects due to the tag selection to be kept under control .    tagging kaons are identified as tracks with momentum @xmath46 me-.07em v , originating from the @xmath17@xmath18 collision point  ( i.p . ) .",
    "the kaon decay vertex must be within a fiducial volume ( fv ) defined as a cylinder of radius @xmath47 cm , and height |z|<130 cm , centered at the i.p .",
    ", coaxial with the beams .",
    "the decay track , extrapolated to the calorimeter , must point to an appropriate energy deposit .",
    "@xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) decays are selected by applying a 3@xmath48 cuts around the muon ( pion ) momentum calculated in the kaon rest frame , according to the proper mass hypothesis . for the @xmath34 tag ,",
    "identification of the @xmath49 from the vertex is also required .",
    "finally , to reduce the dependency of the tag selection efficiency on the decay mode of the signal kaon , the energy deposits associated to the tagging decay , are required to satisfy the calorimeter trigger . in the analyzed data set about",
    "60 million tag decays were identified and divided into the four tag samples .",
    "the value of the tag bias , which accounts for the capability to separate each event into a `` tag '' and a `` signal '' part , is shown in table  [ tab : tb ] separately per tag and per signal .",
    "this correction ranges from about -3% to + 4% following the tag sample used .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : l3errosummary ]    the final errors are dominated by the statistical error of the efficiency corrections : the tracking is the dominant contribution for the @xmath50 measurement , while for @xmath51 , tracking and muon cluster corrections are at the same level .",
    "final fractional accuracy ranges , depending on the tag sample , from 1.5% to 2.1% for the @xmath50 , and from 1.5% to 2.7% for the @xmath51 measurements .",
    "the @xmath52  for the 4 independent - tag measurements is 1.62/3 , with a probability of about 65% for the @xmath50 , and 1.07/3 , with a probability of about 78% for the @xmath51 decays .",
    "the averages of the four results are : @xmath53 for the @xmath50 , and @xmath54 for the @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath52  between different charge measurements is 0.17/1 , with a probability of about 68% for the @xmath50 , and 0.12/1 , with a probability of about 73% for the @xmath51 decays .",
    "final b-0.1em r  results have a fractional accuracy of 1.1% for the @xmath50 and of 1.2% for the @xmath51 decays , and are in agreement within the errors with the kloe preliminary results  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 value affects the b-0.1em r  values via the geometrical acceptance evaluation . from suitable mc sample",
    "the b-0.1em r  dependency on the @xmath55 has been estimated : b-0.1em r(@xmath16,@xmath56 ) = b-0.1em r(@xmath16,@xmath56@xmath57)@xmath58(1 - 0.45(@xmath55-@xmath56@xmath57)/@xmath56@xmath57 ) , with @xmath56@xmath57 = 12.36ns , b-0.1em r(@xmath50,@xmath56@xmath57 ) = 4.968% , and b-0.1em r(@xmath51,@xmath56@xmath57 ) = 3.234% .",
    "the final results are evaluated using the pdg06  @xcite fit value @xmath56 = 12.384(24)ns .    while the correlation between the @xmath50 and @xmath51 signals induced by the fit procedure is low ( about 1% ) , a correlation is caused by the corrections to the tag bias , which are equal for the two signals , by the same data / mc corrections for the tracking and the clustering , and finally by the selection cuts . excluding the error coming from @xmath55 value , the complete information is contained in the error matrix : @xmath59 from which a 62.74% of correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be extracted .",
    "for @xmath51 only also the dependency on @xmath60 has to be considered .",
    "the final @xmath9 has been evaluated using @xmath60@xmath220.015 and the relation @xmath9 = 0.0327 - 0.0230  @xmath60 , obtained from a dedicated mc study .",
    "the limited knowledge of @xmath60 value gives a negligible contribution to the systematic error .",
    "the b-0.1em r  are completely inclusive .",
    "the radiated photon acceptance is determined with a generator that uses the soft - photon approximation to sum the amplitudes for real and virtual processes to all order of @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath62=@xmath63 has been measured in the four tag samples used for the b-0.1em r  measurements . with respect to the b-0.1em r , @xmath62 benefits of smaller tag bias corrections ranging from 0.4% to 0.8% depending on the tag sample .",
    "the correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 coming from the fit procedure and from the efficiency corrections has been taken into account in calculating the error on @xmath62 . as in the b-0.1em r  determination ,",
    "the errors are dominated by the statistics of the efficiency corrections .",
    "the average of the four tag sample measurements is @xmath64@xmath65 .",
    "this measurement has a fractional error of about 1.3% and is in agreement within the errors with the theoretical prediction : @xmath66@xmath67 , where the integrals ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 , @xmath71 corrections are from  @xcite .",
    "the br s of the semileptonic @xmath32 decays , together with the already published results for the semileptonic decays of the @xmath30  @xcite and @xmath31  @xcite , allow five independent determinations of the observable @xmath72 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vusfzero ] . all inputs , but @xmath16 branching ratios , needed to extract @xmath72  are from  @xcite .",
    "the average of the five @xmath72  values , taking correlations into account , gives @xmath72  = 0.2154(5 ) , with @xmath52  = 4.37/4 , and has a probability of @xmath2236% .",
    "using @xmath73= 0.961(8 ) from  @xcite , @xmath11  is 0.2241(19 ) .",
    "this is compatibile with the unitarity at 1.5  @xmath48 , in fact using @xmath12=0.97377(27 )  @xcite , @xmath12@xmath74+@xmath11@xmath74 - 1 is equal to -0.0015(10 ) .",
    "@xmath72  can be evaluated also by charge state .",
    "using @xmath75  values we obtain 0.2155(6 ) , while using @xmath32 we obtain 0.2146(12 ) . these two determination",
    "have a @xmath52  of 0.48/1 with a probability of 49% .",
    "the comparison of @xmath72  results by charge state , allow to evaluate empirical @xmath76su(2 ) correction .",
    "this is 1.88(58)% , and has to be compared with the @xmath77 prediction of 2.31(22)% .",
    "the two evaluations are in agreement within the errors .",
    "lepton universality can be tested comparing the  value from the @xmath16 measurements , @xmath78 , and the one from the sm expectations , @xmath66 , defined in the previuos section .",
    "defining @xmath79 = @xmath78/@xmath66 , and using the b-0.1em r  kloe results we obtain for neutral kaon @xmath79(@xmath80 ) = 1.013(9 ) , and for charged kaon @xmath79(@xmath32 ) = 0.988(11 ) .",
    "both results are compatibile with 1 within the errors , and average to @xmath79=1.003(7 ) , with a @xmath52  of 3.60/1 and a probability of 5.8% .",
