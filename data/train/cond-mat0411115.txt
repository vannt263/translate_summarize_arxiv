    "in an earlier publication  @xcite we considered the interaction of a quantum mechanical squid ring ( a single josephson weak link , capacitance @xmath0 , enclosed by a thick superconducting ring , inductance @xmath1 ) with a classical electromagnetic ( em ) field . using quasi - classical floquet theory  @xcite to solve the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for the squid ring , we were able to show that the ring - field interaction could be very highly non - perturbative in nature .",
    "in essence this is due to the ring hamiltonian  @xcite containing a cosine term ( the josephson coupling energy ) which can generate non - linearities to all orders .",
    "in addition , this hamiltonian and its solutions are @xmath2-periodic in the external static magnetic flux @xmath3 applied to the ring .",
    "this quantum non - linearity ensures that energy exchange between the field and the ring is dominated by multiphoton absorption ( and emission ) processes  @xcite .",
    "as we have demonstrated , this is the case even at modest field amplitudes and at frequencies much less than the separation between the ring energy levels @xmath4 . in this work we showed that these energy exchanges occurred over very small regions in the bias flux @xmath5 .",
    "the values in @xmath5 at which these exchanges take place are determined by the ring energy level structure and the field frequency @xmath6 and flux amplitude @xmath7 . to be precise",
    ", it is in the exchange regions that the energy expectation value appears to jump ( for example , using a two level model ) between the time - averaged energies of the ground and first excited states of the ring .",
    "each transition ( exchange ) region corresponds to the separation between the ring eigenenergies equalling @xmath8 , @xmath9 integer , leading to multiphoton absorption , or emission , between the ring and the field .",
    "it is in these regions that the non - linear nature of the ring hamiltonian becomes manifest and where strong ( and non - perturbative ) time dependent superpositions occur between the original eigenstates of the ring .",
    "currently there is a great deal of interest in using mesoscopic squid rings ( and other weak link based circuits ) in quantum technologies , for example , in quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "this interest has been stimulated by recent experimental work on probing quantum mechanical superposition states in josephson weak link circuit systems  @xcite , and even more so in the last year by reports of superposition states in squid rings  @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the theoretical description of weak link systems interacting with em fields ( classical and quantum mechanical ) is likely to be of great importance in the development of any future superconducting quantum technologies . in this regard",
    "the very strong non - linear behaviour exhibited by a single weak link squid ring in the exchange regions , referred to above , may prove to be of great utility . in order to test this viewpoint we have recently considered , within a fully quantum mechanical framework , the interaction of a squid ring with an oscillator field mode  @xcite , i.e. the simplest coupled system we could have chosen ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "we found that for the case of the em field in a coherent state the results derived from this quantum approach compare very well with those obtained previously using quasi - classical floquet theory . in both approaches the ring and the field mode only couple strongly together within the exchange regions , i.e over certain narrow regions in the bias flux @xmath5 .",
    "this means that @xmath5 can be used to control the coupling without losing superposition coherence in the system .",
    "we note that this work relates to quantum optical interactions in few level atoms and to few level systems involving either ( superconducting ) electron pairs or single electrons  @xcite .",
    "these initial results for a two mode ( ring + oscillator ) system have encouraged us to draw more parallels with quantum optics .",
    "rather than simply consider the squid ring as an electronic device , we may also view it as a tunable , @xmath10-periodic , non - linear medium to couple a system of quantum oscillators together",
    ". regarded as a non - linear medium , there is a clear analogy to other non - linear quantum systems in the context of quantum optics .",
    "however , there are two crucial differences , both of which may be of great importance in future quantum technologies .",
    "first , unlike the squid ring , in quantum optical systems the medium usually displays a weak polynomial non - linearity , even in strong fields  @xcite .",
    "second , all of the properties of the squid ( quantum or quasi - classical ) are @xmath10-periodic in bias flux .    in this paper , our objective is to explore the consequences of the strong quantum non - linearity of the squid ring on the interaction , via the ring , of two oscillator field modes .",
    "this arrangement is depicted in figure  [ f2 ] ,    with the two field modes and the ring oscillator frequencies taken to be @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "as we shall see , the addition of the second field mode makes this a much more sophisticated and interesting system than the two mode system ( ring+field oscillator ) which was the subject of a recent publication  @xcite , even though the computational demands that need to be met are very much greater . in this regard",
    "it is widely viewed  @xcite that the squid ring , as a coherent quantum device , has many potential applications in the design , development and operation of quantum mechanical circuits and quantum logic elements . in this paper",
    "we consider two aspects of the quantum behaviour of a squid ring which could have a serious impact in these areas , namely the transfer of entanglement and frequency conversion between em field modes via the quantum non - linearity of the ring . in this work",
    "we discuss frequency conversion and entanglement for just two field modes .",
    "however , if the non - linear aspects of quantum squid ring behaviour can be fully exploited more complicated operations could be envisaged .",
    "these may include using squid rings to couple / decouple entangled states in extended qubit circuit structures and allow frequency conversion processes between field modes to be modulated , producing coherent pulse modulated signals . in our opinion",
    ", the combination of such strong non - linear properties , coupled with @xmath10-periodic external bias flux control of this behaviour , makes the squid ring quite unique as a device for application in quantum technologies .",
    "thus , although the following calculations are concerned with some of the basic consequences of the quantum interaction of em field modes with a squid ring , we also wish to emphasize the technological possibilities which may open up as these ring - field mode systems become more fully understood .    in the work presented here we first consider briefly the two mode system , including a static bias flux @xmath5 ( figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to relate the quasi - classical floquet approach to the fully quantum mechanical treatment and demonstrate that our quantum model can produce consistent results .",
    "it also provides the background formalism for our main goal which is the study of two em field modes coupled through a squid ring . since our purpose is to study the full quantum mechanics of the ring - field mode ( 1 or  2 ) system , we assume throughout that the operating temperature @xmath14 is such that @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "this ensures that both the ring and field mode(s ) behave quantum mechanically .",
    "we then consider the extended quantum circuit , the two oscillator field modes ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) coupled through a squid ring ( @xmath19 ) - figure  [ f2 ] - with a bias flux @xmath5 also coupled to the ring . in previous papers  @xcite this bias flux was used to control the behaviour of the squid ring alone or the ring interacting with one field mode . in the current paper it is used to control the interaction between two field modes via the non - linear properties of the squid ring . at first sight there might appear to be no a priori reason why , in this three mode system , it should prove easy to couple all the components together strongly .",
    "however , at least for the case of weak inductive coupling between the modes , we shall show that well characterized energy exchange can take place at ( or close to ) certain specific values of @xmath5 . in these regions of bias flux multiphoton absorption and emission processes occur .",
    "thus , the energy required for an interaction to take place is approximately equal to the energy transfer in the absorption or emission of an integer number of photons with frequency @xmath20 in the first field mode to an integer number of photons with frequency @xmath21 in the second .",
    "as for the two mode ( ring+field mode ) system , these are the exchange regions where the effective coupling becomes strong because of the non - linearity of the squid ring .",
    "as we shall see , it is in these regions that many interesting quantum phenomena can be observed .    to emphasize that the coupling across the extended three mode system is controlled by the bias flux",
    ", we calculate the average number of quanta in each mode and show that there is a large exchange of energy between the three modes at specific values of @xmath5 , thus demonstrating that frequency conversion can take place in the system .",
    "in addition , we also calculate the second order correlation @xmath22 ( again controlled by the bias flux ) which quantifies the quantum statistics ( bunching of quanta ) for all three modes  @xcite .",
    "we show that as the system evolves in time , strong entanglement occurs between the three modes .",
    "we quantify this by calculating various entropic quantities based on the von neumann entropy  @xcite .",
    "these are chosen for convenience and familiarity and because they can be used to quantify the degree of entanglement between the subsystems ( field modes and squid ring ) .",
    "although these entropic quantities do have deficiencies as measures of entanglement  @xcite , there is no real consensus about which is the preferred measure within the quantum technology community . in the absence of any consensus",
    ", we opt for a familiar choice .",

    "we can solve the time independent schrdinger equation to find the eigenvalues of the squid ring alone as a function of applied flux @xmath29 .",
    "as an example , we show in figure  [ f3 ]    the first three eigenenergies of the ring [ @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the ground state , etc . ] over the range @xmath32 using parameters typical of a quantum regime squid ring  @xcite , i.e. @xmath33f , @xmath34h ( hence @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 . with @xmath28 turned on , we can use ( [ eq : hamtdse ] ) to solve the corresponding tdse . again , by way of illustration , we show in figure  [ f4 ]    the computed time averaged ring energy expectation values for the first three floquet states ( eigenvalues of the evolution operator after one period of em field evolution ) as a function of @xmath38 using the ring parameters of figure  [ f3 ] . here , @xmath39 has been set at @xmath40 with the associated @xmath41 . as can be seen , energy exchange between these time averaged energies occurs at specific values of the bias flux @xmath5 and , as we have already pointed out",
    ", the number and position in @xmath5 of these exchange regions depends on @xmath39 , @xmath28 and the energy level structure of the ring .",
    "we have observed that these transition ( exchange ) points occur for values of bias flux such that ( at least for small em field amplitudes @xmath28 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "we note that for the squid ring we can write down a renormalized oscillator frequency @xmath44 which is related to the fact that there is an @xmath45 term in a taylor expansion of the cosine ( josephson ) term in the ring hamiltonian([eq : hamtdse ] ) .      in the fully quantum description",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath46 for the squid ring - em oscillator mode system can be written as  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are , respectively , the hamiltonian contributions for the field and the ring and @xmath50 is the interaction energy linking these together .",
    "following equation ( [ eq : hamtdse ] ) , the hamiltonian for the squid ring alone is  @xcite @xmath51    while the hamiltonian for the em field ( modelled as a parallel capacitance @xmath52 - inductance @xmath53 cavity mode equivalent circuit with infinite parallel resistance on resonance ) takes the form @xmath54 . here ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are , respectively , the cavity mode magnetic flux and charge operators for a field mode frequency @xmath57 .",
    "this cavity mode is coupled inductively to the squid ring with a coupling energy @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the em field - squid ring flux linkage factor .    by making a suitable transformation [ using the unitary translation operator @xmath60 the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hams ] ) - now in calligraphic script",
    "- can be written more conveniently as @xmath61 while the hamiltonian for the em field mode remains unaffected .",
    "however , the interaction energy does transform to @xmath62 .",
    "we denote the magnetic flux dependent eigenstates of @xmath63 by @xmath64 . in our computations",
    "we then use a truncated energy eigenbasis both for the ring ( @xmath65)and the em field mode ( @xmath66 )",
    ". the basis states @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are taken so that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are , respectively , much greater than the average number of quanta in the ring and em field .    using this truncated basis",
    ", we can then solve    @xmath72    to obtain the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of the two mode system hamiltonian @xmath73 .",
    "the eigenenergies for the ring - field mode system are shown in figure  [ f5 ]    for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath74 values used for figure  [ f3 ] , with @xmath75 , as in figure  [ f4 ] . here ,",
    "in figure  [ f5](a ) the field mode - ring linkage factor @xmath76 while in figure  [ f5](b ) it is @xmath77 . from this spectral decomposition",
    "we can form the evolution operator via    @xmath78    the time averaged energy expectation values @xmath79 for the ring  @xcite and the field ( i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) can then be calculated using the expression    @xmath82dt \\label{eq : average}\\ ] ]    where @xmath83 @xmath84 are the reduced density operators for the em mode and the squid ring , respectively . in practice , we have been able to ensure the convergence of the integral ( [ eq : average ] ) by integrating numerically from @xmath85 up to @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , provided we select the correct initial state for the em field in the two mode system , there should exist a correspondence between the floquet method used in section [ iia ] [ using ( [ eq : hamtdse ] ) ] and the result of a fully quantum mechanical calculation . as an initial state",
    "the coherent state is an obvious choice since it is the closest quantum state to a monochromatic em field , as used in the floquet approach above . with this choice",
    "we would expect a reasonable agreement between the fully quantum and quasi - classical computations .",
    "in fact the match between these two approaches can be very good . to compare with the quasi - classical result of section [ iia ]",
    ", we set the zero time @xmath87 product state as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a coherent state of the field ( @xmath90    the calculated @xmath91 for an integration time @xmath92 with the energies normalized in units of @xmath93 .",
    "the computations have been made over the range @xmath32 for the values of @xmath94 , using the squid ring capacitance , inductance and @xmath95-dependent energy level structure of figure  [ f4 ] . here , as for figure  [ f3 ] , we have made @xmath96 while setting the flux linkage factor @xmath97 .",
    "we chose this value of @xmath59 so that the amplitude of oscillation of the coherent state in the em field coupled to the squid ring is equivalent to that used in the floquet calculation of figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "it is apparent that the time averaged energy expectation values , and their exchange regions , calculated in the quantum model as a function of @xmath5 are very close to those found using the quasi - classical floquet approach .",
    "to emphasise this , we show in figure  [ f7 ]    the two calculations superimposed .",
    "the very close fit between the two gives us confidence that the quantum model is physically valid with an accurate correspondence to the quasi - classical regime when a coherent state is chosen for the em field .",
    "as we have already noted for the squid ring in a classical field ( section [ iia ] ) , we observed that transition ( or strong coupling ) regions occur when @xmath98 from figure  [ f5 ] we can see that this situation exists when degeneracies in the spectrum of the system are lifted due to the coupling term between the hamiltonians for the squid ring and em field .",
    "following on from ( [ eq:2total ] ) , we now consider a squid ring with oscillator frequency @xmath99 , threaded , as before , by a static bias flux @xmath5 , but now coupled to two em field modes of frequency @xmath100 and @xmath21 ( see figure  [ f2 ] ) . with the usual flux @xmath101-charge @xmath102 commutation relation @xmath103   = i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}$ ] , the total hamiltonian @xmath104 for this system can be written as    @xmath105    where the squid ring hamiltonian is given by ( [ eq : hamst ] ) which has been transformed into the @xmath5 basis .",
    "we choose to write our component hamiltonians in ( [ eq:3total ] ) in terms of the annihilation @xmath106   $ ] and creation @xmath107 $ ] operators as @xmath108 where the position and momentum operators can be defined in terms of the magnetic flux and the charge operators via @xmath109 and @xmath110 for oscillator frequencies @xmath111 , with the subscript @xmath112 denoting @xmath113 for the fields@xmath114or @xmath115 for the ring .",
    "hence the hamiltonians of the components of the system are identical ( but extended to include an extra field mode ) to those used in [ iib ] , but written in terms of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the interaction energies @xmath116 and @xmath117 in ( [ eq:3total ] ) , each of which represents the inductive coupling between the squid ring and the oscillator modes @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , are given by @xmath120",

    "we use greek script , for example @xmath125 to represent the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath63 in order to distinguish these from the number eigenstates @xmath126 of the ring @xmath127 .    in dealing with the time evolution of the coupled three mode system we must first solve the eigenproblem",
    "[ see ( [ eq : eigen ] ) ] . as in section [ ii ] for the two mode system ,",
    "we use a truncated basis .",
    "this has the form    @xmath128    where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the number states for the two field modes and @xmath131 are the energy eigenstates of the squid ring hamiltonian . here , @xmath132 , @xmath70 and @xmath133",
    "are taken to be much greater than the average number of quanta in each component of the system . with the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of ( [ eq : eigen ] ) , but using the three mode hamiltonian , the evolution operator can be calculated using the expression ( [ eq : evolution ] ) . then , assuming that the system at @xmath134 is described by the density matrix @xmath135 , the density matrix @xmath136 at a later time @xmath137 can be found , as can the reduced density matrices @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 . with these density matrices determined , we can then investigate a range of parameters which reveal much of the quantum behaviour of the three mode system , for example , the von neumann entropy .    in the following sections of the paper we present numerical results demonstrating various aspects of this behaviour .",
    "since the examples given are intended to be illustrative in nature , for simplicity we have made the capacitances for all three modes of the system the same , these being typical of quantum regime oscillators operating at a few k , i.e. @xmath144 . amongst other things we wish to show that quantum frequency conversion can occur between the two oscillator field modes , via the squid ring .",
    "we have therefore made the two mode frequencies differ by a factor of two , i.e. @xmath145 while again , for simplicity , setting @xmath146 . with all capacitances identical",
    "these frequencies correspond to @xmath147 for a typical squid ring inductance @xmath148 ( see section [ ii ] ) . again , as in section [ ii ] , we have put @xmath149 which is typical value of the pair tunnelling matrix element for quantum regime squid rings operating at a few k. in addition , we have set the ring - field mode flux linkage factors at @xmath150 and @xmath151  which approximates to some reported experiments in the literature involving two oscillator field modes coupled through a squid ring  @xcite .      in section [ ii ]",
    "we demonstrated that strong coupling between the squid ring and the em field occurs when degeneracies in the spectrum of the hamiltonian are lifted due to the coupling between the components of the system .",
    "numerically , this equates to the condition @xmath42 , where @xmath71 is integer and the @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the @xmath154 and @xmath155 eigenvalues of the system hamiltonian @xmath73 .",
    "these regions of strong coupling ( the exchange regions ) , which develop at specific values of the bias flux @xmath156 applied to the squid ring , are dependent on the ring eigenenergy structure and the frequency of the em field .",
    "similarly , for the three mode system strong energy exchange will occur between the two field modes and the squid ring when the coupling terms lift degeneracies in the spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "this will occur when @xmath157 where , now , the @xmath158 are the @xmath159 eigenvalues of @xmath160 and @xmath161 are integers ( positive or negative ) . in this case",

    "taking the ring - field parameters set above , we have calculated the energy eigenvalues for the three mode system .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ f8 ] .",
    "it can be seen that these eigenenergies possess a very rich structure which leads directly to the results presented in this paper .    given a choice of the initial state for the fields in the two oscillator modes",
    ", we can calculate the time averaged energy expectation values ( normalized in units of @xmath165 ) of @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath63 using equation ( [ eq : average ] ) and integrating numerically from @xmath85 up to @xmath168 . as an example , we show in figure  [ f9](a )    these time averaged energies plotted as a function of @xmath29 assuming that at @xmath134 the system is in the state @xmath169 , i.e. with one photon in the first em mode and none in the second .",
    "the peaks are a manifestation of the strong coupling between the various oscillators at and around specific values of @xmath29 where the energy transfer between the various components of the three mode system occurs .",
    "thus , starting in the initial state @xmath170 , it can be seen that in the exchange regions , on average , energy is being transferred from the first mode to the squid ring and to the second mode .",
    "this will become more transparent when we compute the time evolution of the expectation values of the number operators for the components of the system ( below ) . in figure  [ f9](b )",
    "we show one of the three mode exchange regions ( around @xmath171 ) of figure  [ f9](a ) on a much expanded scale so that the details can be seen more clearly .",
    "an important aspect of non - classical electromagnetic fields is the quantum statistics of photons ( bunching of photons ) described by the second order correlations  @xcite @xmath172;i={\\ e_{1}},{e_{2}},s \\label{eq : g2}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath173 corresponds to poissonian statistics .",
    "values of @xmath174 greater than  1 indicate photon bunching ( i.e. where the photons arrive in groups ) while values of @xmath174 smaller than one indicate antibunching ( i.e. the regular arrival of photons ) .",

    "we show that the statistics of photons threading the squid ring affects the statistics of electron pair condensate tunnelling through the josephson junction in the ring .",
    "this is quantified by the second order correlations although higher order correlations can also be calculated  @xcite .",
    "these correlations fully describe the quantum statistics and quantum noise of the photons in the two field modes and the superconducting condensate .",
    "the creation of entangled states of multi - particle systems is a key feature of all quantum technologies . in their pursuit",
    "the generation of entanglements in real physical systems is clearly of very considerable interest . in this regard",
    ", it appears that the non - linear properties of the squid ring can be used very efficiently to entangle circuit subsystems ( here , field oscillator modes ) that are coupled to it .",
    "as we shall also show , the ring non - linearity can also be used with facility to generate energy conversion between the two oscillator field modes . again , taking as our example the three mode system of figure  [ f2 ] , we shall demonstrate that as this system evolves in time its three components become , to a greater or lesser extent , entangled .",
    "the degree of this entanglement can be quantified by using entropic quantities .",

    "examples of the calculation of this entanglement for the two mode system can be found in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "an analogous quantity can be used to characterize the entanglement of a three component system  @xcite .",

    "this can be used to demonstrate that the quantity @xmath189 is positive or zero .",
    "we note that to prove this presented a very difficult problem in the theory of entropy ( it was a conjecture for many years until a proof was provided  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we are not going to proceed further into this deep problem of entanglement in three component systems as it has been discussed in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",

    "i.e. because we are using the squid ring as the intermediary between the two field modes , we choose to show numerical results for the entanglement between the squid and the first mode ( @xmath184 ) , the squid and the second mode ( @xmath194 ) and also the @xmath195 .",
    "as we have shown in figures  [ f6 ] and  [ f9 ] , strong coupling between the various of components of ring - field mode systems only occurs over small regions in @xmath5 - the exchange regions .",
    "we now see how the variation in coupling across an exchange region affects the number operator expectation values , quantum statistics and entanglements - all important quantities reflecting on the quantum behaviour of these systems .",

    "for the example where we adopt a coherent state for the first mode we choose for illustrative purposes ( and computational ease ) the system state @xmath201 .      as is evident from figures  [ f9](a ) and  [ f9](b ) ,",
    "the flux bias points have been selected either to be well away from , or within , an exchange region , i.e. point a and points b and c , respectively . for a complete , quantitative view of the system we should compute , in sequence , the number expectation values @xmath202 , the entropies @xmath203and the @xmath204 correlations for the first field mode @xmath205 , the squid ring @xmath206 and the second field mode @xmath207 as a function of normalized time @xmath208 . however , it is apparent in figure  [ f10 ]    ( bias point a ) that , starting in a pure state @xmath200 for @xmath17 , the number expectation values ( a ) and entropies ( b ) remain constant as a function of time .",
    "we note that @xmath209 is not zero because the ground state @xmath210 of the squid ring is not the same as the ground state of a simple harmonic oscillator @xmath211 . from the definition given in section [ ivb ] , the fact that @xmath212 makes the calculation of @xmath213 for the second mode at bias point a physically unmeaningful since this is division by zero .",
    "it is therefore very sensitive to numerical error .",
    "however , such is not the case when the bias point point is shifted into an exchange region . starting again with the system state @xmath200 , we show in figures  [ f11 ]    ( bias point b ) and  [ f12 ] ( bias point c ) the average number of quanta - the @xmath214 - in each of the three modes as a function of time . with this choice of starting state",
    "these results demonstrate clearly the quasi - periodic exchange of energy between the various components of the system .",
    "since the exchange coupling is strongest at c , this is where we would expect to find the maximum energy transfer between the first and second field modes , as is the case ( figure  [ f12 ] ) .",
    "we note that in the computed results of figure  [ f12 ] the second field mode number expectation value ( and that of the squid ring to a much smaller extent ) is a maximum when that for the first field mode is a minimum .",
    "this is the signature for frequency ( down ) conversion , in this example by a factor of two .",
    "the process could , of course , be run backwards to generate frequency up conversion from the second to the first field mode via the quantum non - linearity of the squid ring .",
    "given that this non - linearity can be to all orders , we see no obvious reason why much higher ratio frequency conversions should not prove practicable .    from a theoretical viewpoint",
    "the problem with demonstrating high ratio frequency conversions is the rapid rise in the number of basis states required as the down ( up ) conversion frequency ratio increases .",
    "the computational difficulties increase accordingly .",
    "nevertheless , even given the limitations on the computational power we have available ( compaq xp1000 alphaserver with 2 gb ram ) , we have been able to demonstrate quantum down conversion by a factor of ten in frequency .",
    "we intend to deal with this in a future publication .",
    "there is some indication that these down conversion processes occur  @xcite . in figure  [ f12 ]",
    "the input state is the number state @xmath215 but , as we shall show , down conversion can occur for a coherent input state .",
    "it may well be that this ability to generate photon down / up conversion could have practical application for pure state sources in quantum information processing and quantum computing .",
    "for example , it may prove desirable to take single photon terahertz sources , as are now being developed  @xcite , and use these to provide the input state to a squid ring to generate photons at much lower frequencies suitable for solid state quantum circuit technologies .",
    "it is also clear that if very large down / up frequency conversion ratios can be achieved experimentally , there could well be interesting metrological applications , for example , in frequency standards .",
    "this role in linking the two field modes together in a strongly non - linear , quantum mechanical manner is emphasized in figures  [ f13 ]    and  [ f14 ]    . here ,",
    "the time varying entanglement entropies are computed for bias points b ( figure  [ f13 ] ) and c ( figure  [ f14 ] ) following the definitions given in section [ ivc ] . here , again",
    ", we have started the system in state @xmath216 .",
    "it can be seen that the entanglement between the various components of the system ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath217 ) , and the total entanglement entropy for the system @xmath218 , are stronger at c than at b which , from figures  [ f9](b ) ,  [ f11 ] and  [ f12 ] , is to be expected . in our opinion",
    "it is this ability to control the degree of entanglement between the components of ( for example ) this three mode system simply by changing @xmath5 which marks out the squid ring as a potentially very useful device in future quantum circuit technologies .",
    "this is emphasized by the contrast between figures  [ f10](b ) ( for bias point a ) and  [ f14 ] , where the system and subsystem entanglement go from zero to a maximum for an adjustment in @xmath5 around @xmath219 .",
    "although , in the above we have considered in some detail entanglement between two field modes ( input and output ) interacting via a squid ring , there are many other coupled systems of field modes and squid rings which could be studied .",
    "one which may be of importance , both scientifically and technologically , is an input field mode linked through a squid ring to two separate output modes at half the input frequency . from the results obtained in this paper",
    "we would expect the two ( down converted ) photons to be strongly entangled with the degree of entanglement controlled , again , by the bias flux @xmath5 applied to the ring .",
    "furthermore , given the non - linearity of the squid ring , we would also expect it to be possible to entangle a large number of output photons starting at an initial input frequency and down converting to a whole set of lower frequency output modes . as a technique",
    ", the use of a squid ring to generate entanglements between several systems could well be applied to great advantage in fundamental experimental studies of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "it could also have implications in quantum computing , for example , in creating an entangled input register for a quantum computer .",
    "it has also been suggested that the creation of ( large number ) multi - particle entangled systems could lead to new sensors and instrumentation of unparalleled sensitivity  @xcite and it may be that squid rings are very well suited to creating these entanglements , at least for photons .",
    "there are other possible ways that the input register of a quantum computer could be based on the non - linear properties of squid rings described in this paper .",
    "for example , we could set the three modes of the coupled system in figure  [ f2 ] all to have the same oscillator frequency @xmath99 .",
    "then , with @xmath5 biased within an exchange region , we could arrange to create a qubit superposition state of @xmath220 and @xmath221 in the output mode starting from the number state @xmath221 of the input mode .",
    "as our results have demonstrated , this could be done in such a way as to ensure that the input and output oscillator modes are entangled .",
    "once the desired qubit state of the output mode had been realised , in principle the bias flux could then be switched away rapidly from the exchange region ( or switched off ) thus leaving the input and output modes entangled but uncoupled .",
    "an array of these circuits could then be used as an qubit register for a quantum computer , where the qubits would be entangled but not coupled to the input modes .",
    "conceivably , this arrangement could facilitate quantum error correction for quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "schemes of this kind may well find application in quantum encryption and transmission of information at a more complex level than is usually considered  @xcite .    since the underlying purpose of this work is to demonstrate the influence of the squid ring non - linearity on a coupled quantum system , it is important to show quantitatively the way in which the quantum statistics of the photons affects the quantum statistics of the electron pairs ( i.e. the superconducting condensate flowing through the weak link in the ring ) .",
    "as we explained above ( section [ ivb ] ) , this is quantified with the second order correlations @xmath222 . in figures",
    "[ f15 ]    and  [ f16 ]    we plot the second order correlations @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 for bias points b and c as functions of time with , again , a starting state for the system of @xmath226 . as with the number expectation values and the entanglement entropies , we see a strong oscillatory behaviour , particularly in figure  [ f16 ] ( biased at point c ) . in order to interpret the results we first note that for the state @xmath227 @xmath228 , or other states close to this state , the average number of photons is near zero . from equation ( [ eq : g2 ] )",
    "this means that the second order correlation becomes very large .",
    "we also note for the number state @xmath229 , @xmath230 and the corresponding @xmath231 . with this in mind , we see in figure  [ f15 ] ( bias point b ) that the first field mode , in number state @xmath232 at @xmath134 , starts with a @xmath213 at zero .",
    "it remains extremely close to this value over the time of the computation , i.e. this field mode stays reasonably close to the number state @xmath233 .",
    "by contrast , the second field mode , assumed to be in the state @xmath234 at @xmath134 , has on average a large @xmath213 value , although this dips well below unity almost periodically with time .",
    "this demonstrates that even at bias point b , on the edge of the exchange region , the value of @xmath235 regularly falls below one .",
    "it also shows that for this initial condition the quantum statistics of the second field mode can not be described by classical means . in figure",
    "[ f16 ] ( bias point c ) , at @xmath134 , we again assume that the first field mode is in state @xmath236 with the second in state @xmath234 . as before , the first field mode starts at @xmath237 but as the wavefunction for the system evolves with time we see that @xmath223 regularly shifts away from zero . correspondingly , the first field mode is no longer in the pure number state @xmath215 due to its interaction with the rest of the system@xmath238 the first field mode is described by a reduced density operator which , at these points , represents statistical mixture of states with a low photon number expectation value ( as can be seen from figure  [ f12 ] ) . as a consequence , @xmath223 increases since the denominator in equation ( [ eq : g2 ] ) becomes very small around these points .      in figures",
    "[ f17 ] ,    [ f18 ]    and  [ f19 ]    we show the number expectation values , the entanglement entropies and the @xmath174 correlations for the bias point c in figure  [ f9](b ) , taking the initial state of the system as @xmath239 , i.e. where the first field mode is in the coherent state @xmath240 at @xmath134 .",
    "it is apparent ( figure  [ f17 ] ) that there is energy transfer , via the squid ring , between the first and second field modes of the system , just as in figure  [ f12 ] for the pure state @xmath241 .",
    "thus , when @xmath242 decreases @xmath243 increases , and vice versa . however , it is evident that the regular oscillatory behaviour seen in figures  [ f11 ] and  [ f12 ] has been lost .",
    "we note that , as in figures  [ f11 ] and  [ f12 ] , the number expectation value of the squid ring remains at a roughly constant value , highlighting the view that the squid ring is acting as a non - linear control medium linking the two quantum field modes together . in figure  [ f18 ]",
    "we see that the components of the system again entangled very strongly but , unlike the previous computations of figures  [ f13 ] and  [ f14 ] , there is no longer any quasi - periodic disentanglement to be seen .",
    "the system remains entangled at all points in time , i.e. the total entanglement entropy is always high . in figure  [ f19 ]",
    "there is clearly a significant deviation from the behaviour of the @xmath174 coefficients displayed in figures  [ f15 ] and  [ f16 ] .",
    "thus , in figure  [ f19 ] , @xmath244 is close to one for all of the time evolution ( and for most of the time just greater than one ) whereas @xmath245 spends most of its time just less than one and @xmath246 is almost always greater than one .    in all the examples given above we observe that ,",
    "as expected , the system displays strong entanglement when the first field mode has a low number expectation value , i.e. the components of the system have evolved away from their initial pure states .",
    "we also note that when we start the first field mode in the pure state @xmath247 , at bias points b and c , we find strong entanglement between the various components of the coupled system which , at certain times ( semi - periodically ) , disentangle .",
    "the entanglement entropies are , of course , theoretical quantities that demonstrate the development of quantum correlations between the three modes . in principle , experimental observation of these quantum correlations can be achieved by determining bell type inequalities  @xcite . in the context of the work presented here",
    "this will require further theoretical investigation . in figures",
    "[ f15 ] ,  [ f16 ] and  [ f19 ] it is evident that the @xmath248 correlation coefficient for at least one of the components of the system becomes less than one at some point in the evolution of the system .",
    "hence , for the initial conditions used in this work , we conclude that the photon statistics of this system can not be described by classical optics .",
    "in this paper we have studied the coupling of a squid ring to two em field modes . for this",
    "we have made the assumption that the ambient temperature of the system is low enough to be able to treat each of the three components ( ring + two field modes ) quantum mechanically .",
    "our purpose has been to demonstrate that the squid ring , as a non - linear quantum object , can be used to couple a number of quantum oscillators together to generate physical phenomena of great interest .",
    "as we have emphasized , there exist obvious parallels with the field of quantum optics .",
    "however , in quantum optical systems the coupling media involved generally display only weak polynomial non - linearity . in contrast the squid ring , with the cosine term in its hamiltonian description , can generate non - linear interactions to all orders .",
    "it is this , plus the @xmath10-periodic nature of its behaviour as a function of external flux @xmath95 , which makes the squid ring of such interest in the burgeoning field of quantum circuit technology .",
    "viewed from the perspective of quantum optics , the squid ring ( or a set of coupled squid rings ) can be thought of as a non - linear medium par excellence which can easily create very strongly coupled regimes ( albeit at lower frequencies - for example , at thz frequencies and below ) which are inaccessible using conventional optical materials .    in our theoretical investigations of the two em field modes coupled through a quantum squid ring",
    "we have also applied a static external magnetic flux @xmath249 to the ring . in this paper",
    "we started with the simpler example of a squid ring interacting with a single em mode .",
    "we showed that the coupling between the components of the system can be strong .",
    "this strong coupling only occurs over small ranges in @xmath5 , centred around specific values of this bias flux , i.e. in what we term exchange regions which are govern by the energy eigenstructure of the system .",
    "it is in and around the exchange regions that the quantum non - linear nature of the squid ring is made manifest through the coupling of the field modes via the ring .",
    "for example , in these regions energy can be exchanged between the field modes and the squid ring and , through the intermediary of the ring , between the field modes themselves . from this",
    "we suggest that , suitably driven , this system may act as a frequency converter suitable for operation up to the thz range . from our viewpoint",
    "this illustrates the utility of these exchange regions since it is here that the strong quantum couplings develop between the components of the system .",
    "we have added to this perspective by calculating other physical phenomena associated with such a coupled quantum system . to illustrate this we have computed the statistics of the various quanta ( quantified with the second order correlations ) and the degree of entanglement ( quantified with various entropies ) between the components of the system , both outside and within the exchange regions .",
    "our results demonstrate quite clearly that the mesoscopic squid ring can be used as a flux tunable element to manipulate these ( and presumably other ) quantum properties of these coupled circuit systems . as such",
    ", the work presented here may be of considerable relevance to current experiments on quantum superposition of states in squid rings and on probing crossing / anticrossing regions of their energy level structure  @xcite .",
    "we note that we have neglected dissipation in the results presented in this paper .",
    "thus , we have computed the time evolution of the three mode system using the equation @xmath250 $ ] . a more realistic calculation , with dissipation due to the environment taken into account ( for example , in the references  ) is now being developed .",
    "the equation for the time evolution then takes the form @xmath250+f(\\rho)$ ] , where a dissipative term @xmath251 has been introduced to represent the environment .",
    "we intend to extend our work to investigate in detail the effects of this environmental dissipation on the behaviour of squid ring - field mode systems .",
    "we suggest that the three component system ( squid ring + two field modes ) , and its extensions , is rich in possibilities for device applications ( e.g. in quantum gates , quantum encryption and frequency conversion ) ; it is also a pointer to more sophisticated quantum technologies in the future  @xcite .",
    "given that the technical problems associated with such technologies can be overcome , it seems likely that the squid ring ( and related weak link circuits ) will , in the future , be able to operate at thz frequencies .",
    "this could complement the current drive to develop thz applications in ( classical ) communications and imaging  @xcite .",
    "it would also allow for quantum circuit technologies to be utilized at quite accessible temperatures .",
