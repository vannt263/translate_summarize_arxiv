    "numerous experiments combined with some simulations showed that for the usual conditions of electron irradiation , that is , when the radiation - induced clusters of vacancies and self - interstitial atoms are not formed and the heterogeneous precipitation on them is basically absent , sans and atp measurements at @xmath13 typically do not reveal any copper - rich precipitates @xcite , even though the alloys remain to be strongly supersaturated .",
    "the absence of a significant homogeneous copper precipitation in these electron - irradiated fe - cu - based alloys is commonly explained `` by the very low volume fraction of probably very small precipitates , ... and ... one can infer that the limit of observable copper precipitation at 290 @xmath4c is located between @xmath2=0.09 and 0.08% '' @xcite , or `` between @xmath2=0.1 and 0.2% '' @xcite . in particular , cluster dynamics simulations of homogeneous precipitation at @xmath2=0.088% , described in @xcite",

    "therefore , theoretical studies of copper precipitation in very dilute fe - cu - based alloys near the concentration or temperature limits of such precipitation , @xmath10 for the homogeneous nucleation and @xmath11 for the heterogeneous nucleation , seem to be interesting from both fundamental and applied standpoints , even for binary fe - cu alloys which can be considered as model alloys for the rpv steels @xcite .",
    "such theoretical studies can be particularly interesting if they can sufficiently reliably predict the temperature dependencies of these precipitation limits at elevated @xmath20c for which experimental estimates are either uncertain or absent .",
    "a consistent @xmath5 model for studies of precipitation kinetics in fe - cu alloys has been recently developed by soisson and fu @xcite , and detailed kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations of precipitation in a number of fe - cu alloys at different @xmath3 and @xmath2 based on this model yield a good agreement with available experimental data @xcite .",
    "therefore , this model and kmc methods developed in @xcite seem to be prospective to study the above - discussed problem of copper precipitation in dilute fe - cu alloys .",
    "we will also use the statistical theory of nucleation and growth of isolated precipitates ( to be abbreviated as stn ) developed by dobretsov and vaks @xcite .",
    "this theory provides microscopic expressions for both the nucleation barrier ( activation barrier for the formation of a critical embryo ) @xmath6 and the prefactor @xmath7 in the phenomenological zeldovich and volmer formula for the nucleation rate @xmath8 ( the number of supercritical embryos formed in unit volume per unit time ) @xcite valid for the initial , steady - state nucleation stage of precipitation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reciprocal temperature .",
    "the stn corresponds to a number of refinements of earlier models of nucleation suggested by cahn - hilliard @xcite and langer @xcite .",
    "it is based on the generalized gibbs distribution approach @xcite and enables one to quantitatively calculate values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the microscopic alloy model chosen , particularly in the case of high nucleation barriers , @xmath23 , which just corresponds to the dilute alloys under consideration . in description of growth of supercritical embryos",
    "we also use the phenomenological equation of such growth suggested in the classical theory of nucleation @xcite and access validity of this equation by comparison with our kmc simulations .    in all our simulations and calculations",
    "we consider only homogeneous precipitation and accept the conventional assumption ( discussed , in particular , by mathon et al .",
    "@xcite ) that for the moderate irradiation intensity ( i.e. when the ratio of ballistic jump frequency to thermally activated jump frequency is small ) , the main effect of irradiation is to increase the point defect concentrations , and hence the fe and cu diffusion coefficients .",
    "it means that the precipitation kinetics under electron irradiation is the same as that during thermal aging at the same temperature , except for an acceleration factor @xmath24 defined by the relation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the copper diffusivities during thermal aging and under irradiation , respectively .",

    "1 we present some characteristics of critical embryos . to illustrate both concentration and temperature dependencies of these characteristics , we consider two series of fe@xmath0cu@xmath1 alloys : those with the same temperature @xmath17c but different concentrations @xmath2 varying from @xmath52 to @xmath53% ( table 1 ) , and those with the same concentration @xmath54 but different temperatures @xmath3 varying from @xmath55 to 390@xmath4c ( table 2 ) . in these tables , @xmath56 is the total number of copper atoms within the embryo , and @xmath57 is its effective radius defined as that of the sphere having the same volume as @xmath56 copper atoms in the bcc lattice of @xmath58-iron with the lattice constant @xmath59=0.288 nm : @xmath60 note that this critical radius ( as well as the precipitate radius @xmath61 in eq .",

    "1 illustrates variations of structure of critical embryos with concentration or temperature .",
    "the results presented in tables 1 , 2 and fig.1 clearly illustrate very sharp variations of both structure and thermodynamics of critical embryos with concentration @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3 . in particular , at @xmath17c ,",
    "the decrease of concentration from @xmath68 to @xmath69 leads to the increase of the embryo size @xmath56 and the reduced nucleation barrier @xmath70 by about three times : from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , and from @xmath73 to @xmath74 . according to the zeldovich - volmer relation ( [ j - j_0 ] ) , the latter implies decreasing the nucleation rate by about ten orders of magnitude ( variation with @xmath2 of the prefactor @xmath7 in ( [ j - j_0 ] ) will be shown to be negligible ) .",
    "table 2 illustrates a similar sharp increase of @xmath56 and @xmath70 under elevating temperature between 290 and @xmath75c .",
    "1 shows that this sharp rise of sizes and nucleation barriers is accompanied by notable changes in the structure of the embryo : its boundary at high @xmath76 is much less diffuse than that at moderate @xmath77 .",

    "1 we note that these profiles ( as well as those shown in fig . 1 in @xcite and fig . 2 in @xcite ) usually correspond to rather diffuse interfaces . at the same time , kmc simulations show that only very small clusters can have a diffuse interface , while for @xmath78 nm ( that is , @xmath79 copper atoms ) one observes almost `` pure '' copper clusters with a sharp interface , see , e.g. , fig . 8 in @xcite .",
    "however , one should take into account that the profiles shown in fig . 1 ( and other similar figures )",
    "correspond to statistical averaging over all orientations of a cluster which is typically rather anisotropic , and this averaging leads to diffuse interfaces ; it is illustrated , in particular , by fig .",

    "it seems also natural to assume that these precipitation limits at different temperatures @xmath3 correspond to the similar values of the activation factor @xmath113 .",

    "one can also try to extend this approach to the case of the heterogeneous precipitation of copper on clusters of irradiation - induced point defects , vacancies and self - interstitial atoms ( that is , to the case of neutron or ion irradiation @xcite-@xcite ) , to estimate the appropriate heterogeneous precipitation limit @xmath293 , which is more interesting for applications .",
    "even though kinetic paths of the heterogeneous and the homogeneous precipitation differ from each other ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) , the main physical origin for suppressing precipitation at low solute concentrations @xmath2 seems to be the same for both processes . in both cases ,",
    "formation of a precipitate needs overcoming the energetic barrier due to the surface loss in the free energy @xmath48 which is not compensated by the volume gain in @xmath48 until the precipitate volume becomes sufficiently large .",
    "differences between these two processes are usually related mainly to some geometrical factors which depend on the structure of the heterogeneity @xcite .",
