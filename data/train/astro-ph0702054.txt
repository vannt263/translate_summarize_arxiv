    "the galaxies in our sample are at @xmath3 and have @xmath4 m@xmath5 . in order to obtain most reliable results ,",
    "our sample was selected to be suitable for image decomposition : galaxies are close to face - on ( @xmath6 ) , are not morphologically disturbed , and have an apparent diameter larger than @xmath7 .",
    "the fits are done with the new version of budda ( @xcite ) and checked individually to avoid wrong results that can arise from automated procedures .",
    "the models include up to four components : bulge , disk , bar and central source .",
    "this allows fitting galaxies with bars without compromising bulge and disk parameters , and to take into account the contribution from type 1 agn .",
    "figure 1 shows an illustrative example .    .",
    "at left we show @xmath8 color composites of the original galaxy image , the total model , the models of each separate component and a enhanced residual image . in the latter ,",
    "one clearly sees the spiral arms and the inner ring / lens fragments that surrounds the bar .",
    "the negative residuals also delineate the fainter inter - arm areas of the disk .",
    "this is likewise true for the region between the bar and the inner ring .",

    "amongst our first main results , with @xmath9 of the sample analysed , we find that :    * there is a correlation between the effective radius of the bulge and the 4000   break index d@xmath10(4000 ) , in the sense that smaller bulges have younger stellar populations ( see also @xcite ) ; * the @xmath11 colours of bulges and bars are strongly correlated for galaxies of all bulge - to - total luminosity ratios ( b / t ) . in fact ,",
    "bulges and bars have similar colours .",
    "we are currently investigating whether this is a result of dust attenuation or colour gradients .",
    "we also find a correlation between the colours of disks and bulges that shows the same triangular pattern noted by @xcite using ultraviolet colours .",
    "blue bulges are almost always surrounded by blue disks , but galaxies with red bulges can have either blue or red disks . finally , the correlation between bar and disk colours is weak , even for late - type galaxies , with low values of b / t .",
    "bars are usually redder than their disks ; * there is a gradual increase in b / t and stellar mass from star forming galaxies ( b / t @xmath12 ) to composite systems ( b / t @xmath13 ) and agn hosts ( b / t @xmath14 ) ; * the median _ bar_-to - total luminosity ratio is bar / t @xmath15 regardless of agn or star formation activity and the total stellar mass of the galaxy ; bar / t ranges from @xmath16 0.01 to @xmath16 0.3 ; * there is an anti - correlation between the effective radius of the bulge and the accretion rate onto the supermassive black hole in agn hosts , parameterized as @xmath17}/{\\rm m}_\\bullet$ ] , in the sense that the hosts of the most powerful agn have smaller bulges ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , at a fixed bulge size , the hosts of the most powerful agn have bluer disks , in consonance with the results in @xcite ; * the effective radius of the bulge is the _ only _ structural parameter that shows a clear correlation with the accretion rate onto the black hole .",
    "the bulge srsic index and the bulge effective surface brightness show only weak trends .",
    "the accretion rate does not depend on any structural parameter of either the disk or the bar .",
