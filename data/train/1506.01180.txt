    "moreover , m71 together with a few more metal  rich ggcs ( 47 tuc , ngc  6528 , ngc  6553 ) plays a fundamental role in the calibration of spectrophotometric indices adopted to constrain the age , the metallicity and the shape of the initial - mass - function of unresolved stellar populations in early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of m71 is that it is affected by a large reddening with a mean value of @xmath7=0.323@xmath20.017  mag @xcite and by a differential reddening with a mean value of @xmath8=0.035@xmath20.015  mag , which extents up to the maximum value of @xmath9=0.074  mag @xcite ( for the reddening values see also * ? ? ?",

    "the layout of the paper is the following .",
    "_  _ in section [ obs ] we present the dataset and the strategy adopted for data reduction . in section [ sect2 ]",

    "the theoretical framework adopted to estimate the absolute age of m71 is presented in section [ sect4 ] and [ sect5 ] , while in section [ sect6 ] we discuss the absolute age estimates based on the classical main sequence turn - off and on the main sequence knee .",
    "finally , in section [ sect7 ] we summarize the results and outline future perspectives .",
    "to investigate the absolute age of m71 we used the images of the megacam ( 36 charge coupled devices , ccd ; total field of view ( fov):@xmath14x@xmath14 ; scale : 0.187@xmath15/pixel ) mounted on the cfht .",
    "the dataset includes 50 dithered images taken with the @xmath16 ( sdss ) bands @xcite .",
    "we retrieved from the canadian astronomy data centre , five shallow and five deep images per filter with the following exposure times ( ets ) : @xmath17=30 , 500  sec ; @xmath18=5 , 250  sec ; @xmath19=5 , 300  sec ; and @xmath20=15 , 500  sec .",
    "the mean seeing ranges from @xmath211.0 ( @xmath22 ) up to @xmath211.3 ( @xmath23 ) arcseconds .",
    "the data were pre - processed with the elixir programs @xcite .",
    "the globular m71 covers a small sky area , and indeed its tidal radius is @xmath24=8  .9 @xcite , therefore , we only used the 20 innermost ccds for a total fov of 0@xmath10.6x1@xmath10.0 . for each frame we provided an accurate psf ( point spread function ) photometry by using the daophot  iv and allstar @xcite , and we used daomatch / daomaster to scale individual chips on a common geometrical reference system .",
    "once we obtained the global catalog ( master list of stars ) of the entire dataset we run allframe @xcite simultaneously over the entire set of images . we obtained a list of 370,000 stars with at least one measurement in four different photometric bands . to calibrate the instrumental magnitudes",

    "they agree quite well not only along the red giant branch ( rgb ) , but also along the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "the anonymous referee noted that for @xmath3-band magnitudes fainter than @xmath2122   mag ( @xmath5 cmd ; @xmath2520.5 mag for the @xmath26 cmd ) the ridgelines provided by clem attain colors that are slightly bluer ( redder for the @xmath26 cmd ) than observed . the difference is mainly caused by the different approaches adopted to perform the photometry , in selecting candidate cluster stars and in the calibration to standards .",
    "our approach is based on simultaneous photometry on shallow and deep @xmath0 images .",
    "this allowed us to reach a better photometric precision in the faint magnitude limit .",
    "stars plotted in fig .",
    "1 have been selected according to the cluster radial distance ( 60@xmath27@xmath28@xmath27250 arcsec ) , and to photometric quality parameters ( @xmath29  mag , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "data plotted in this figure indicate that the lower ms is better defined , less affected by the field star contamination ( see fig .  12 in clem et al .",
    "we adopted the same local standard stars provided by @xcite and followed a similar procedure @xcite to transform the instrumental magnitudes into standard magnitudes .",
    "unfortunately , we can not perform a detailed comparison among the different calibration equations , since their zero - points and coefficients of the color terms are not available .",
    "the intrinsic error in magnitude and in color are plotted as red error bars .",
    "they take account of the photometric error and of the absolute calibration and attain values of the order of a few hundredths of magnitude down to the lower main sequence .",
    "this trend is also supported by the photometric error in the @xmath3-band plotted in the rightmost panel of the same figure .",
    "it is of the order of a few hundredths of magnitude down to the bending of the ms ( @xmath3223 mag ) .",
    "finally , we performed an astrometric solution of the catalog by using the ucac4 catalog .",
    "the root mean square error of the positions is @xmath3355 @xmath34 arcseconds .",
    "to separate candidate cluster and field stars we devised a new approach that fully exploit the multi - band data set we are dealing with .",
    "we performed a preliminary radial selection and to avoid the crowded central regions we only selected stars located inside an annulus with @xmath28=2   and @xmath28=5  centred on the cluster .",
    "on the basis of this sample we generated two isodensity maps in the @xmath26 and in the @xmath5 cmds ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . to properly constrain the cluster ridge line we developed a numerical algorithm that pin points the peaks of the isocontour plots and provides a preliminary version of the cluster ridgeline .",
    "note that in the approach we devised , the overdensity caused by red hb stars was neglected .",
    "the preliminary ridgeline is then fit with a bicubic spline and visually smoothed , in particular in the bright portion of the rgb .",
    "the analytical ridgelines are sampled at the same @xmath3 magnitude levels ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the red lines plotted in the left and in the right panel of fig .  [ f2 ] show the final version of the estimated ridgelines .",
    "the two analytical ridgelines were used to generate a 3d plot color - color - magnitude diagram ( ccmd) @xmath1 of the cluster . the fig .",
    "[ f3 ] shows the 3d ridgeline ( red solid line ) together with the entire sample of stars with measurement in the the @xmath35 bands .",
    "we considered as candidate cluster stars those located within the 3d ridgeline @xmath21@xmath36 , where @xmath36 is defined as two times the quadratic sum of the photometric errors in the three quoted bands .",
    "the above approach has several indisputable advantages when compared with classical photometric methods in selecting field and cluster stars .",
    "_ i _ ) the selection in the ccmd takes advantage of the typical effective temperature correlation of stellar structures in a color  color plane .",
    "current approach takes also advantage of the fact that we are simultaneously using photometric bands covering a broad range in central wavelenghts , and in particular , of the @xmath37band .",
    "this means a solid separation not only between stars and field galaxies , but also between field and cluster stars @xcite .",
    "however , the color - color - diagram approach is prone to degeneracy between dwarf field and giant cluster stars sharing very similar optical colors .",
    "_ ii _ ) the selection in the cmd takes advantage of the typical correlation between cluster stars located at the same distance ( apparent magnitude ) and their color .",
    "however , the cmd approach is prone to spurious selections interlopers located at different distances , i.e. field stars associated either to the galactic halo or to the galactic disk stars .",
    "this means that after the selection of the stars located across the ridgeline we need to take account of the fraction of field stars that have been erroneously classified as candidate cluster stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the approach based on the ccmd takes account of the advantages of both the color - color - diagram and of the cmd selection criteria . to validate the approach we adopted , fig .",
    "[ f4 ] shows the @xmath5 cmd , before ( left ) and after ( middle ) the selection .",
    "the candidate field stars are plotted in the right panel .",
    "the magnitude and color distribution of field stars support the plausibility of the adopted selection criterion , since we recover the two typical peaks in @xmath38 color at @xmath210.6 and at @xmath211.5  mag of field dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "data plotted in the middle panel display a smooth and well sampled cmd from the tip of the rgb down to the lower ms .",
    "moreover , the presence of field stars in the same region of the cmd in which we would expect candidate cluster stars on the basis of the cmd , is further supporting the approach we developed .",
    "we highlight that the isodensity maps plotted in fig .  2",
    "show a secondary peak at magnitude slightly brighter ( 17@xmath3917.5  mag ) and bluer ( @xmath401.2 mag ; @xmath41 0.6  mag ) than the ridgeline of the candidate cluster stars .",
    "we performed several tests changing the ridgeline either in the @xmath26 or in the @xmath5 density map and checking the impact on the ccmd .",
    "we found that this blue plume mainly includes candidate field stars .",
    "this finding is supported by the smooth distribution of cluster msto stars in fig .  1 and by the presence of the blue plume stars in the cmd of candidate field stars plotted in the left panel of fig .  4 .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for drawing our attention on this group of stars .",
    "to estimate the cluster age we used the evolutionary tracks and the cluster isochrones of the pisa stellar evolution data base for low - mass stars , computed using franec stellar evolutionary code @xcite .",

    "the helium abundances as a function of the metal abundances were estimated by using a linear helium  to  metal enrichment ratio of @xmath48 = 2 @xcite .",

    "the adopted sets of evolutionary models bracket , within the errors , the observed iron abundance of m71 .",
    "the two adopted grids of evolutionary models cover the typical range in mass of low  mass stars , namely @xmath49= 0.301.10 @xmath50 .",

    "current findings support the discrepancy , but the comparison also display a good agreement along the ms ( @xmath6020 mag ) . thus suggesting that the mismatch between theory and observations might also be due to marginal changes in the adopted chemical composition .    to further constrain the above working hypothesis",
    ", we performed the same comparison , but by adopting a slightly more metal  rich chemical composition ( @xmath46=0.004 , @xmath47=0.256 ) .",
    "data plotted in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] clearly show that the discrepancy between theory and observations increases .",
    "this applies not only to the msto region where the difference is of the order of 0.3  mag , but also along the rgb / sgb and the ms , and indeed the isochrones attain colors that are systematically bluer than observed .",
    "moreover , it is worth mentioning that the increase of 0.13  dex in iron abundance also causes a clear discrepancy along the sgb region in the other cmds ( panels @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath65 ) and does not improve the agreement in the lower ms .",
    "current evidence further supports the strong sensitivity of the @xmath37band to the metal content and suggests that the mild discrepancy found in the color of to region of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 cmd might also be affected by the adopted abundance of @xmath42-elements and/or of cno - elements .",
    "the occurrence of a well defined knee in the low  mass regime of the ms has already been brought forward in the literature .",

    "current evolutionary prescriptions indicate that this feature is mainly caused by the collisionally induced absorption of h@xmath69 at nir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the shape of the bending marginally depends on the metal content , but the magnitude of the knee is essentially independent of cluster age and of metallicity .",
    "the above theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the magnitude difference between the ms knee ( msk ) and the msto , i.e. @xmath6 , is a robust diagnostic to constrain the absolute cluster age .",
    "the key advantages of the new approach is that the above difference in magnitude is independent of uncertainties affecting both the distance and the reddening of the stellar system .",
    "recent empirical evidence indicate that the this new approach provides cluster ages that are a factor of two more precise when compared with the classical method of the msto @xcite .    in passing",
    ", we also note that the @xmath6 method appears more robust than the traditional horizontal ( difference in color between the rgb , typically 2.5  mag brighter than the msto , and the msto ) and vertical ( difference in magnitude between the hb luminosity level , typically at the rr lyrae instability strip , and the msto ) methods ( @xcite ; v13 ) .",
    "according to theory , ms stellar structures with a stellar mass of @xmath700.5 - 0.4  @xmath71 are minimally affected by uncertainties in the treatment of convection , since the convective motions are nearly adiabatic @xcite .",
    "the same outcome does not apply to cool hb stars and to sgb stars adopted in the vertical and in the horizontal method , respectively .",
    "moreover , the msk can be easily identified in all stellar systems with a well populated ms .",
    "it is independent of the uncertainties affecting the estimate of the hb luminosity level when moving from metal  poor ( blue and extreme hb morphology ) to metal  rich ( red hb morphology ) gcs ( @xcite ; v13 ) .",
    "morover , the @xmath6 method is also independent of the theoretical uncertainties plaguing the color  temperature transformations required in the horizontal method to constrain the cluster age .    in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning that both the vertical and the horizontal method are robust diagnostics of optical cmds .",
    "recent accurate and deep nir cmds show that hb stars display a well defined slope when moving from hot and extreme hb stars to cool red hb stars @xcite . the same outcome applies to the cmds based on near uv and far uv bands @xcite .",
    "this means that the identification of the hb luminosity level required by the vertical method is hampered by the exact location in color of the anchor along the hb .",
    "moreover , the difference in color between the msto and an anchor along the rgb , required by the horizontal method , is hampered by the fact that the rgb becomes almost vertical in nir bands .",
    "this means that the difference in color is steadily decreasing @xcite    finally , the minimal dependence on the metal content allow us to tight correlate the @xmath6 directly to the absolute age of the stellar system .",
    "this means that the new approach provides absolute age estimates , while the horizontal and the vertical method do provide estimates of the relative age .      to further constrain , on an empirical basis , the robustness of the @xmath6 to estimate the absolute age of gcs we also investigated the beding in the optical bands @xcite and in particular in the @xmath37 and in the @xmath66band",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "1 ) detailed atmosphere models taking account of the collision - induced absorption ( cia ) opacities of both h@xmath69h@xmath69 and h@xmath69he indicate that cia induces a strong continuum depression in the nir region of the spectrum @xcite . the same outcome applies to the uv region of the spectrum for surface gravities and effective temperatures typical of cool ms stars ( see figs . 5 and 6 in * ?",
    "it is interesting to note that the above effect is also anticorrelated with the iron abundance .",
    "the increase in the iron abundance causes , at low effective temperatures , an increase of the molecular opacities ( see fig .  7 in",
    "* ) , leading to a weaker impact of the cia on the continuum .",
    "2 ) interestingly enough , recent deep and accurate optical ",
    "uv cmd already showed the presence of a well defined knee in the low  mass regime of the ms .",
    "@xcite clearly identified a well defined knee in the lower ms of two old open cluster : ngc  2420 and m67 ( see their fig .",
    "a similar evidence was also found in the v , b@xmath72i cmd of m4 @xcite . the lack of a clear evidence of a knee in the lower ms can be associated either to the use of v , r , i bands in which the knee is less evident or to the fact that the photometry is not deep / accurate enough to properly identify the knee .    to properly constrain the impact that cia has on the uv flux , and in particular on the blue magnitude and colors , we performed a specific test .",
    "we adopted an old ( 12  gyr ) cluster isochrone and selected three stellar structures with stellar masses ranging from 0.30 to 0.45 @xmath71 .",
    "the surface gravities and the effective temperature of the selected models are listed in table  [ tab3 ] . using these values as input parameters , we computed two specific sets of atmospheric models ( spectra ) , one that neglects and one that takes account of the cia opacities .",
    "data plotted in fig .  [ f7 ] display that cia has a substantial impact on the emerging flux of high - gravity , low effective temperature stellar structure .    in the color - magnitude region common to the two sets , the models that take account of cia ( see red line in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) are , at fixed stellar mass , @xmath210.1 mag fainter than those without cia opacity , the differences increasing as the effective temperature decreases .",
    "notice also that , at a fixed luminosity , the inclusion of cia produces models @xmath210.05  mag bluer than the models without cia .",
    "the difference becomes more evident in the very low - mass regime and at longer wavelengths .    in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning that the above atmosphere models either taking account of or neglecting the cia opacity rely on the input physics adopted in the latest version of the phoenix bt - settl atmosphere structures @xcite .",
    "these models when compared with previous atmosphere models computed by @xcite present two differences : a ) the former use the solar mixture provided by asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , while the latter use the solar mixture provided by grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) ; b ) the former models include a more complete list of cia opacities .",
    "in particular , they take account of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath69 ) , molecular nitrogen ( n@xmath69 ) , methane and carbon dioxide ( co@xmath69 ) .",
    "the main difference with previous models is in the use of opacities provided by abel & frommhold ( 2011 ) that provide less absorptions at high temperatures when compared with earlier computations by @xcite .",

    "we transformed the best fit cluster isochrone ( 12  gyr ) and chemical composition ( = -0.87 dex , [ @xmath42/fe]=+0.3 ) using also the recent @xcite spectra .    to overcome problems in the adopted solar mixtures the two sets of atmosphere models were interpolated at fixed metallicity ( = -0.87 dex ) .",
    "we found that the difference in the @xmath3 magnitude is negligible , and indeed , it is of the order of 1% at msto and becomes at most of the order of a few hundredths of magnitude in the region across the msk .",
    "we performed the same experiment , but the atmosphere models were interpolated at fixed global metallicity z. the difference between the two sets of atmosphere models was , once again , minimal . thus suggesting that new atmosphere models have a minimal impact on the conclusions of the current investigation .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the the impact that cia and molecular line opacities have on uv , optical and nir colors over a broad range of metal abundances will be addressed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "current photometry is very accurate and precise over at least ten magnitudes ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "this outcome applies in particular to the bluer bands ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "moreover , theory and observations display a well defined knee ( @xmath2521.5 mag ) in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( @xmath402.9 mag ) and in the @xmath3 , @xmath38 ( @xmath731.4 mag ) cmd .",

    "rich clusters by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figures 5 and 8) .",
    "therefore , we decided to take advantage of this evidence and to estimate the absolute age of m71 by using both the classical msto method and the new @xmath6 method .",
    "the latter method appears very promising , since the vertical method might be more prone to possible systematic uncertainties in the metal  rich regime .",

    "the vertical method is typically anchored to the mean magnitude of cluster rr lyrae .",
    "therefore , the application to metal - rich clusters is  once again  difficult , since a theoretical / empirical correction is required .",
    "the homogeneity of the diagnostic adopted to estimate the absolute age is a crucial issue in this context , since we are interested in constraining possible differences in age between metal  poor and metal  rich gcs .",
    "the approach adopted to estimate the observed magnitudes of both msto and msk has already been discussed in detail by @xcite in their investigation of ngc  3201 . in the following , we briefly outline the main steps of the quoted approach .",
    "the observed ridgeline of the @xmath5 cmd was equally sampled ( @xmath740.01 mag ) using a cubic spline , and then , the msto and the msk magnitudes were estimated as the points showing the minimum curvature along the ms ridgeline .",
    "we found that the msto is located at @xmath75  mag , while the msk at @xmath76  mag .",
    "note that the uncertainties account for the photometric errors and for errors in the ridgeline and in the location of the above points ( see fig .",
    "[ f8 ] ) .    to estimate the absolute age of m71 with the classical msto method we adopted the more metal  poor ( @xmath46=0.003 , @xmath47=0.254 ) set of isochrones , since they take account for the observed stars in the different cmds .",
    "note that the marginal difference in color between observations and theory  in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 cmd  has a minimal impact on the absolute age estimate , since we are only using the magnitude of the msto .",
    "data plotted in our fig .  [ f5 ] indicate an absolute age for m71 of order of 12  gyr . to properly estimate the age and the errors affecting the ages based on the msto we followed the approach suggested by @xcite",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we selected the @xmath3-band absolute magnitude of the msto on cluster isochrones for ages ranging from 8 to 14  gyr .",
    "these estimates were performed in three sets of @xmath3,@xmath38 isochrones computed assuming different chemical compositions , namely : @xmath46=0.002 , @xmath47=0.252 ; @xmath46=0.003 , @xmath47=0.254 and @xmath46=0.004 , @xmath47=0.256 .",
    "note that we adopted this cmd , because these are the bands in which both theory and observations are more precise .",
    "on the basis of the quoted estimates we performed a linear regression among age , metallicity and @xmath3-band absolute magnitude of msto .",
    "we found the following relation :    @xmath77 & = & ( -1.06\\pm0.06 ) + ( 0.51\\pm0.01)\\times m^{to}_{r ' } - \\nonumber\\\\ & & ( 0.09\\pm0.01)\\times [ \\mathrm{fe / h } ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath78 is the absolute age in gyr and the other symbols have their usual meaning . using the above relation we estimated an absolute age for m71 of 12@xmath792  gyr ( see top panel of fig.[f9 ] ) .",
    "the error budget of this determination takes account of photometric errors in the magnitude of the msto ( @xmath800.01 - 0.02  mag ) , in the cluster reddening ( @xmath810.05  mag ) , in the true distance modulus ( @xmath82 0.15  mag ) and in the chemical composition ( @xmath83 } \\sim$]0.1  dex ) .",
    "the current estimate is , within the errors , in good agreement with the absolute ages for m71 available in the literature ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the agreement is quite good with recent estimates based both on ground - based @xcite and on space ( v13 ) photometry together with up - to - dated cluster isochrones @xcite .    to estimate the absolute age with the method of the @xmath6 we adopted the same sets of cluster isochrones ( @xmath46=0.003 ) we used for the msto method",
    "however , the cluster isochrones with ages ranging from 8 to 14  gyr were equally sampled using a cubic spline . the same algorithm adopted to estimate the observed msto and the msk on the ridgelines",
    "was also adopted on the splined isochrones .",
    "the observed and predicted differences in magnitude ( @xmath6 ) between the msk and the msto ( @xmath84 ) are plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "the predicted @xmath6 , at fixed metal content , plotted in this figure show a well defined linear trend over the investigated age range . to provide solid constraints on the errors affecting the absolute age based on the @xmath6",
    ", we followed the same approach adopted for the msto . using the @xmath3,@xmath38 cluster isochrones",

    "the error on the current age is @xmath21  gyr and takes account of uncertainties in photometry and in iron abundance .",
    "the above error is roughly a factor of two smaller than the typical error of absolute ages based on the msto .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that the @xmath6 diagnostic is independent of uncertainties affecting both the distance modulus and the cluster reddening .",
    "moreover , the difference in magnitude@xmath6is also minimally affected by uncertainties in the absolute photometric zero - points .",
    "this means that this approach can also provide very accurate estimates of the relative ages of stellar systems .    in this context , it is worth mentioning that the coefficient of the age indicator attains , as expected , very similar values between msto and @xmath6 .",
    "this is the consequence of the fact that the above diagnostics rely on the same age indicator : the msto . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence on the iron abundance is larger for the @xmath6 than for the msto ( 0.3 vs 0.1 dex ) .",
    "the difference is independent of the adopted magnitude ( @xmath3 ) and color ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we performed several tests using the same cluster isochrones and we found that the metallicity dependence is strongly correlated to the definition of the msk ( maximum vs minimum curvature ) .",
    "moreover , we also found that the metallicity dependence of the age diagnostic ( @xmath6 ) becomes similar to the msto using the the difference in color instead of the difference in magnitude .",
    "the above evidence suggests that the precision of the different age diagnostics is a complex balance among photometric and spectroscopic precision age sensitivity together with uncertainties affecting distances moduli and reddening corrections .",
    "we plan to provide a detailed mapping of the sensitivity of optical , optical - nir and nir cmds in a forthcoming investigation .",
    "we performed accurate and deep multiband ( @xmath0 ) photometry of the metal  rich galactic globular m71 ( ngc  6838 ) .",
    "the images were collected with megacam at cfht and cover one square degree around the center of the cluster . the image quality and the strategy adopted to perform the photometry on both shallow and deep exposures allowed us to provide precise photometry in all the bands from the tip of the rgb to five magnitudes fainter than the msto .",
    "the extended data set of local standards provided by @xcite allowed us to fix the absolute zero  point of the above bands with a precision that is , on average , better than 0.02 mag .",
    "the selected cluster is projected onto the galactic bulge .",
    "this means that absolute age estimates are hampered by the contamination of field bulge stars . to overcome this thorny problem",
    "we deviced a new approach based on the ( @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath38 ) color - color - magnitude diagram .",
    "first we derived accurate ridgelines of candidate cluster stars in the @xmath3,@xmath4 and in the @xmath3,@xmath38 cmds using iso - density contours .",
    "then , they were combined to provide a 3d trace to properly selected candidate cluster stars .",
    "the key advantage of this approach is that it takes advantage of both intrinsic properties ( color selections ) and of the clustering ( same distance ) .",
    "the results appear very promising , but the approach can be further improved using optical - nir color selections .",
    "we computed specific sets of cluster isochrones covering a broad range in ages and in the adopted chemical composition .",
    "moreover , to properly fit observed red giant branch stars , the evolutionary models were computed by adopting three different values for the mixing length parameter . to constrain possible systematics in the transformation into the observational plane",
    ", we paid special attention on the adopted stellar atmosphere models and in the adopted - pass bands .",
    "we found that the latter plays a crucial role in the comparison between theory and observations .",
    "we also investigated the impact that the collisional induced absorption ( cia ) opacity has in occurrence of the main sequence knee in the sloan bands .",
    "we found that cia affects not only nir magnitudes , but also blue bands such as the @xmath37 and the @xmath66 band .",
    "the sensitivity of the short wavelength regime on the cia opacity was predicted by @xcite and now soundly confirmed by both theory and observations .",
    "the comparison between theory and observation is quite good over the entire magnitude range covered by observations in the different cmds .",
    "there is evidence of a mild difference  a few hundredths of magnitude  between cluster isochrones and observations .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the difference is due either to the adopted atmosphere models or to the adopted reddening law .",
    "we estimated the absolute age of m71 using two different diagnostics . using the msto and the cluster isochrones in the @xmath5 cmd",
    ", we found an age of 12@xmath22  gyr .",
    "the error takes account of uncertainties in cluster distance , reddening and iron abundances together with photometric uncertainties .",
    "we performed the same estimate using the knee - method @xcite , i.e. the difference in magnitude between the msto and the msk , in the same cmd .",
    "we found a cluster age that is identical to the age based on the msto , but the uncertainty is of a factor of two smaller .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the fact that the adopted diagnostic@xmath6is independent of uncertainties in cluster distance and reddening .",
    "however , it is more prone to uncertainties affecting cluster iron abundance .",
    "the above age estimates support , within the errors , recent age estimates of metal  rich galactic globulars .",
    "one of the most metal  rich galactic globular ",
    "ngc  6528was investigated by @xcite using deep acs and wfc3 images .",
    "using the msto and a similar set of cluster isochrones they found and absolute age of 11@xmath21  gyr .",
    "the absolute age of this cluster was independently confirmed by @xcite using for the same cluster accurate ground  based stromegren and nir photometry ( t=11@xmath21  gyr ) .",
    "the outcome applies to the age estimates of metal - rich bulge clusters provided by @xcite , by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the scenario emerging from the above empirical evidence is that metal ",
    "rich galactic globulars appear to be , within the errors , coeval with metal  poor globulars @xcite .",
    "this means that the quoted globulars do not show a clear evidence of an age metallicity relation .",
    "this is a preliminary conclusion , since we still lack homogeneous age estimates of a sizeable sample metal ",
    "rich clusters with a precision better than 1  gyr .",
    "the fact that a significant fraction of metal ",
    "rich clusters are located inside or projected onto the bulge is calling for new precise and deep nir photometry . together with the obvious bonus concerning the reduced impact of uncertainties in the cluster reddenings and the possible occurrence of differential reddening ,",
    "there is also the advantage to fully exploit the precision of the new diagnostic ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that the above findings appear also very promising concerning the solid evidence of a dichotomic age distribution of galactic globulars .",
    "this evidence was brought forward by @xcite and subsequently soundly confirmed by @xcite an more recently , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the use of the @xmath6 parameter appears even more promising in this context appears even more promising .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "a ) empirical evidence indicate that the morphology of the msk is well defined when moving from the metal - rich ( ngc  6528 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation ) to the metal ",
    "intermediate ( bono et al . 2010 ) and to the metal - poor regime ( m15 , * ? ? ?",
    "b ) relative ages based on the @xmath6 are less prone to systematics , since the msk is independent of cluster age and mildly affected by changes in helium content .",
    "the vertical method that is based on the difference between the hb luminosity level and the msto is more prone to the quoted possible systematics .",
    "indeed , the hb luminosity level is affected by both cluster age and helium content .",
    "the suggested experiment appears to be luckily supported by the unique opportunity to use in the near future adaptive optics systems at the 8  m class telescope with superb image quality and spatial resolution @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigated the absolute age of the galactic globular cluster m71 ( ngc  6838 ) by using optical ground - based images ( @xmath0 ) collected with the megacam camera at the canada - france - hawaii - telescope ( cfht ) . </S>",
    "<S> we performed a robust selection of field and cluster stars by applying a new method based on the 3d ( @xmath1 ) color - color - magnitude - diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the color - magnitude - diagram of the candidate cluster stars and a new set of isochrones , at the locus of the main sequence turn off ( msto ) , suggests an absolute age of 12@xmath22  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute age was also estimated using the difference in magnitude between the msto and the so - called main sequence knee , a well defined bending occurring in the lower main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> this feature was originally detected in the near - infrared ( nir ) bands and explained as a consequence of an opacity mechanism ( collisionally induced absorption of molecular hydrogen ) in the atmosphere of cool low - mass stars @xcite . the same feature was also detected in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and in the @xmath5 cmd , thus supporting previous theoretical predictions by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key advantage in using the @xmath6 as an age diagnostic is that it is independent of uncertainties affecting the distance , the reddening and the photometric zero - point . </S>",
    "<S> we found an absolute age of 12@xmath21  gyr that agrees , within the errors , with similar age estimates , but the uncertainty is on average a factor of two smaller . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the @xmath6 is more sensitive to the metallicity than the msto , but the dependence becomes vanishing using the difference in color between the msk and the msto . </S>"
