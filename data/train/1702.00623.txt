    "various phenomenological models developed over the years have raised the possibility that nuggets of strange quark matter ( sqm ) , called strangelets , are present in cosmic rays .",
    "such strangelets will have nearly equal numbers of up , down and strange quarks and so will have an anomalous @xmath0 ratio ( @xmath1 )  @xcite , where @xmath2 is the charge and @xmath3 is the baryon number , compared to ordinary nuclei .",
    "one particular model for strangelet propagation through the earth s atmosphere has strongly hinted at the possible presence of low energy (  few mev",
    "/ n ) strangelets at high mountain altitudes  @xcite , although with a very low flux .",
    "also , over the years , various experimental groups have reported the presence of particles with anomalous @xmath0 ratios in cosmic rays  @xcite . but none of those groups have been able to make any definitive claim because of lack of statistics .",
    "so the search for strangelets in cosmic rays remains an active area of research  @xcite .",
    "one of the best ways to look for low energy strangelets with very low fluxes at high mountain altitudes is through the deployment of very large area arrays of nuclear track detectors ( ntds ) .",
    "such passive detector arrays offer several advantages over many other detector types .",
    "they are relatively inexpensive to deploy , easy to maintain and do not require any power for their operation , a fact which offers particular advantages when it comes to the deployment of large arrays at very remote high altitude locations . also because of their high intrinsic thresholds of registration , some ntds offer a natural way to suppress the huge low-@xmath2 background ( neutron recoil tracks , atmospheric radon alpha tracks etc . )",
    "expected in any such experiment .",
    "nuclear track detectors ( ntds ) like cr-39 , makrofol etc . have been used for charged particle detection for many years  @xcite .",
    "we plan to use a particular brand of commercially available polymer , identified as polyethylene terephthalate ( pet )  @xcite , as ntd in the search for exotic particles in cosmic rays , through the deployment of large area arrays of pet films at high mountain altitudes .",
    "pet was found  @xcite to have a much higher detection threshold ( @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is the charge and @xmath5 the measure of the velocity of the impinging particle ) compared to other commercially available ntds like cr-39 , makrofol etc .",
    "( @xmath6 lying in the range 6 - 60 ) .",
    "this makes pet particularly suitable for low energy rare event search in cosmic rays .",
    "before any new material can be employed as a detector , it needs to be properly characterized and calibrated . with that aim ,",
    "systematic studies were carried out on pet to determine its ideal etching condition and also to ascertain its charge response to various ions using accelerators as well as natural radioactive sources . a calibration curve for pet ( @xmath7 vs. @xmath8 , where @xmath7 is the specific energy loss , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the track and the bulk etch rates respectively",
    "while their ratio @xmath8 is the reduced etch rate or charge response ) utilizing @xmath11o , @xmath12s , @xmath13fe , @xmath14u ions was obtained  @xcite .",
    "it was then updated  @xcite with additional data points corresponding to @xmath15xe , @xmath16kr and @xmath17ti ions obtained from the rex - isolde facility at cern .",
    "also , studies were carried out to determine the charge and energy resolution that could be achieved with pet  @xcite .",
    "all these studies have firmly established pet as a very efficient detector of heavily ionizing particles with a detection threshold much higher than the other commercially available detector material cr-39 which is in widespread use today .    in addition to such calibration experiments ,",
    "pilot studies were carried out at different high altitude locations where pet , as well as standard cr-39 detectors , were given open air exposures for durations ranging from a few months to two years .",
    "the goal was to study how the detector behaviour changes with exposure to harsh environmental conditions and also to survey the local radiation background .",
    "the results of such studies are presented in this paper .",
    "the sites chosen for these studies are darjeeling in eastern himalayas , hanle in northern himalayas and ooty in the nilgiri hills .",
    "table  [ table : parameters ] lists the altitudes ( above mean sea level ) and some other parameters associated with those sites .",
    "one reason for the choice of these sites is the existence of scientific research facilities there , which is going to make the eventual deployment and maintenance of any such large area array easier .",
    "also these facilities have records of climatic conditions at those sites going back many years and they continue to collect and maintain such records .",
    "stacks containing three pet films of a4 size ( @xmath18 ) and thickness @xmath19 as well as cr-39 films of size @xmath20 and thickness @xmath21 were mounted on perspex stands and given open air exposures for durations ranging from three months to two years at those sites .",
    "fig  [ detectors ] shows pet films as well as smaller pieces of cr-39 mounted on perspex stands .",
    "the stands in turn are fitted inside a box for convenience of transport .     a4 size pet films as well as smaller pieces of cr-39 mounted on perspex stands . ]",

    "from the studies conducted so far , high threshold pet seem to be a very good choice as a detector material for the planned rare event search .",
    "also hanle appears to be the place most suitable as a site for the setup of the large area array .",
    "the site is basically a cold desert with robust existing scientific research facilities for astronomical research",
    ". we will continue to conduct further studies along these lines as well as begin the process of large scale search for strangelets using large area ntd arrays .",
