    "rapid proton decay in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model is usually avoided by the introduction of @xmath3- ( or matter- ) parity . however , it turns out that in scenarios with gravitino dark matter with masses in the range @xmath4 to a few @xmath5 , a small violation of this symmetry can be desirable since this would reconcile thermal leptogenesis as a source for the baryon asymmetry in the universe with standard primordial baryogenesis @xcite ( for a recent exhaustive study of small bilinear @xmath3-parity violation see @xcite ) .",
    "the tight upper bounds on the corresponding parity - violating couplings , stemming from laboratory experiments @xcite and the non - observation of gamma - ray lines from gravitino decays at fermi lat @xcite , then raise the question how the presence of such small couplings can be understood theoretically .",
    "in this paper we consider the possibility that the small violation of matter parity , which we assume to be embedded into the @xmath6 gauge symmetry , is linked to the condensation of strongly interacting hidden sector fields at low energies .",
    "thermal leptogenesis @xcite via the out - of - equilibrium decay of heavy right - handed neutrinos is one of the most promising models for the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "furthermore , beside explaining the observed excess of baryons over anti - baryons , the introduction of right - handed neutrinos can also naturally explain the smallness of the neutrino masses ; this is known as the see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "leptogenesis as well as the see - saw mechanism favor very high masses for the right - handed neutrinos , and it is well known that especially thermal leptogenesis requires that the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino should be larger than @xmath7gev  @xcite , which gives also a strong lower limit on the reheating temperature .    in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ,",
    "gravitinos play a distinct role due to their planck - suppressed couplings to the observable world , and they are an excellent candidate for being the dark matter observed in the universe .",
    "it is well known that , given a high reheating temperature @xmath8@xmath9 and gravitino masses around @xmath10@xmath11 , the thermal relic density of gravitinos reproduces the correct dark matter abundance  @xcite , in good agreement with thermal leptogenesis .    however , the above scenario is not free of problems : the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , which is often the stau , typically decays into the gravitino with lifetimes that are of the order of minutes or days .",
    "this is generically in conflict with the successful predictions of standard primordial nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , since the nlsp decay releases large amounts of electromagnetic or hadronic energy into the primordial plasma , destroying some of the fragile elements and changing their abundance  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the nlsp is charged , it could form bound states with @xmath12he and @xmath13be , leading to a catalytic over - production of @xmath14li and @xmath15be  @xcite .",
    "different solutions to the above problem were proposed : if in some special scenarios the sneutrino or the stop is the nlsp , their late decay would not affect the predictions of bbn strongly  @xcite . in case of stau nlsps",
    ", a large left - right mixing could lead to suppressed relic abundances  @xcite .",
    "entropy production between thermal freeze - out of the nlsp and bbn could dilute the nlsp and gravitino abundance enough to evade the bbn constraints  @xcite .",
    "the nlsp mass could be nearly degenerate with the gravitino mass , which reduces the released energy  @xcite . or the nlsp could decay into additional hidden sector states before conflicting with bbn  @xcite .",
    "lastly , as mentioned above , in cases where @xmath3-parity is weakly violated , the nlsp can decay into standard model particles before the onset of bbn  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the existence of @xmath3-parity is not automatic .",
    "if it is a global symmetry it is expected to suffer from quantum gravitational ` wormhole ' effects @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to assume an embedding into a local symmetry , which is spontaneously broken at a high scale .",
    "however , the requirement of anomaly cancellation strongly disfavors gauged @xmath16 proposals . another possibility is to understand discrete @xmath3-symmetry  @xcite in the framework of higher - dimensional constructions .",
    "the gauging then corresponds to local coordinate rotations in the extra dimensions , and the @xmath3-parity of the effective theory is a relic of the higher - dimensional lorentz group . in string theory",
    "such discrete @xmath3-symmetries may appear in specific compactifications  @xcite , however , not generically .",
    "alternatively , proton stability in supersymmetric setups can be guaranteed by matter parity .",
    "this is natural in models which incorporate the see - saw mechanism , since the required majorana mass @xmath17 of the right - handed neutrinos violates @xmath2 by two units , thereby breaking @xmath6 to its matter parity subgroup .",
    "note that @xmath6 is the only anomaly - free abelian extension of the standard model , and that it is canonically included in @xmath18 gut proposals .",
    "therefore , we consider the matter parity to be the @xmath19 subgroup of the anomaly - free @xmath6 gauge symmetry throughout this paper .    as argued above , the violation of @xmath3-parity or matter parity is bound to be very small .",
    "this can be achieved by _",
    "e.g. _  connecting @xmath3-parity breaking with @xmath2 breaking , via non - renormalizable operators  @xcite or at loop level in the context of string theory  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "if the hidden sector is charged under @xmath2 , the condensate breaks matter parity at low scale .",
    "it then dominantely couples to the right - handed neutrinos , thereby inducing a sneutrino vacuum expectation value and consequently small bilinear matter parity violation  @xcite of the order @xmath21 , which can lie in the phenomenologically preferred regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we will introduce the hidden sector model and discuss its coupling to the visible sector ; in section 3 we will discuss phenomenological aspects of the model , namely gravitino lsp and stau nlsp decay , thermal production of hidden sector particles and their decay ; section 4 is devoted to further discussions and in section 5 we will conclude .",
    "we consider an extension of the supersymmetric standard model with gauge group @xmath22 where @xmath6 will be broken spontaneously to matter parity at the high scale @xmath17 , and @xmath23 is the gauge group in the hidden sector , responsible for the low - energy matter - parity breaking .",
    "we assume that light neutrino masses are generated in the standard way by the see - saw mechanism after the breaking of @xmath6 at a high scale @xmath17 .",

    "the hidden sector contains two doublet quarks @xmath40 with @xmath2 charge @xmath41 , and two doublet quarks @xmath42 with charge @xmath43 .",

    "we also assumed suppressed couplings between hidden sector and the lighter two right - handed neutrinos , adopting @xmath67 for simplicity . in these models ,",
    "the communication between the matter - parity breaking @xmath219 sector and the visible sector is suppressed by the mass of the heaviest right - handed neutrino , @xmath32 . as an important consequence ,",
    "the mass of the pseudo ng boson of the breaking of the accidental global @xmath2 symmetry in the hidden sector , as well as its relic number density , are small enough to yield a relic density in agreement with the observations , so that the pseudo ng boson constitutes only a subdominant component of dark matter .",
    "furthermore , the relic density and the lifetime of the pseudo ng boson partners can be small enough to be in agreement with the tight bbn constraints .",
    "note that requiring that the lighter two right - handed neutrinos do not change the above phenomenology implies upper limits on @xmath220 and @xmath221 that are at least of the order @xmath222 , since the interactions between hidden and visible sector depends on the ratio @xmath223 .    due to the strong bbn bounds on the relic abundance and the lifetime of the pseudo ng modes of @xmath2 breaking ,",
    "large values of matter - parity breaking are favored in our model .",
    "this implies both a lifetime of the gravitino closer to the experimental limit , as well as shorter decay lengths of the nlsps . for values of matter - parity breaking close to the fermi lat limit",
    ", we estimate the decay length of the stau to be of the order of @xmath224 .",
    "it is very interesting , that this is in principle accessible by the lhc  @xcite .",

    ", the low - scale breaking of discrete symmetries can induce serious cosmological domain wall problems , which arise after the completion of inflation and thus are never diluted  @xcite . in the presented scenario these problems can be avoided in two different ways .",
    "firstly , estimating the maximum temperature @xmath165 of the hidden sector immediately after reheating , by equating @xmath225 , shows that the hidden sector temperature after inflation does never exceed the breaking scale @xmath20 in a large part of the allowed parameter space in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ( namely for @xmath226 in case of @xmath133 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the matter - parity symmetry is never restored after inflation , despite its low breaking scale , thus avoiding all domain wall problems .",
    "secondly , even if the symmetry is restored , domain wall problems can be in principle avoided if the discrete symmetry is embedded into an @xmath227 gauge symmetry , since in that case the minima of the potential are continuously connected and the domain walls are no longer stable .",
    "this mechanism requires however that the gauge symmetry is broken after inflation , since only then the domain walls are bounded by cosmic strings and they shrink and decay rapidly when the @xmath227 is spontaneously broken after inflation ends  @xcite . therefore , in cases where the @xmath6 breaking occurs after inflation , our model is free of cosmological domain wall issues , despite the low scale breaking .",

    "these symmetries are either explicitly broken by higher order operators , for example trilinear terms which do not influence the vacuum ( [ eq : vvev ] ) , or they are symmetries of the full lagrangian . in the latter case",
    "one may gauge the symmetries , since they are anomaly free .",
    "however , we do not want to have additional massless gauge fields in the model , and hence we rather consider unbroken discrete subgroups of these symmetries in that case .",

    "however , if one wants to avoid the prediction of light fermions with masses @xmath247 , generated by a see - saw like mechanism in the hidden sector , we need that @xmath248 .",
    "this may follow if the explicit violation of @xmath249 occurs only via higher - dimensional operators in the hidden sector .",
    "alternatively , one may consider that the fields @xmath245 are moduli of an underlying theory , and therefore have no mass terms .",
    "finally , note that the combination @xmath250 is orthogonal to the vevs @xmath251 .",
    "after supersymmetry breaking this symmetry is broken to its @xmath19 subgroup , which is trivial up to hypercharge .",
    "the absence of linear terms @xmath252 is crucial for our model , since such terms completely remove the vacuum ( [ eq : vvev ] ) .",
    "it can be explained by promoting a discrete subgroup of @xmath253 to a rigorous symmetry of the hidden sector .",
    "an important consequence is then that the lowest mass states of @xmath254 and @xmath255 become stable together with @xmath245 due to the @xmath256 symmetry . as discussed above",
    ", this can be problematic since their relic mass density may overclose the universe , if annihilation into the pseudo ng multiplet is not efficient enough . in this cases",
    "it would be better to break the @xmath257 symmetries explicitly , to allow the decay of the hidden sector particles .",
    "as an example , we note that the linear combination @xmath258 alone is needed in order to forbid the linear terms in @xmath245 . this combination is preserved if we enlarge ( [ eq : wdyn ] ) to @xmath259 we can then gauge @xmath258 and assume it is spontaneously broken to a @xmath19 subgroup at a high scale @xmath260 , such that the heavy hidden sector states have odd parity . if we now identify this @xmath19 with the peccei ",

    "@xmath264 decay channels of the hidden sector states to @xmath265 open up .",
    "this can resolve the overclosing issue of the hidden sector from the start .",
    "since the breaking of this @xmath19 is then related to the generation of the @xmath83 term , we expect that also the linear terms in @xmath245 remain small , since they are additionally suppressed by the scale @xmath260 .",
    "in this paper we have discussed a possible mechanism that generates a small matter - parity violation in the visible sector . such a violation of matter - parity can resolve the tension between gravitino lsps and high reheating temperatures as required by thermal leptogenesis . in our scenario , visible sector and part of the hidden sector",
    "are simultaneously charged under a gauged @xmath6 .",
    "this @xmath6 is broken at a high scale @xmath17 by right - handed neutrino masses to its matter - parity @xmath19 subgroup .",
    "matter - parity is then subsequently broken completely in the hidden sector by a @xmath79 quark condensate at a scale @xmath20 .",
    "this mechanism induces a small vev @xmath266 for the right - handed neutrinos , giving rise to bilinear matter - parity breaking in the visible sector . due to matter - parity breaking , the nlsp , typically a stau or neutralino , can then decay into standard model particles before conflicting with bbn .",
    "since the hidden sector is almost separated from the high - energy @xmath2 breaking sector , the hidden sector possesses an accidental global @xmath2 symmetry which is explicitly broken only through the interactions with the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the effects of the explicit breaking are suppressed by @xmath267 at low energies , and hence the pseudo ng modes arising from the @xmath2 breaking in the hidden sector acquire only very small masses .",
    "the tightest constraints on our proposed model come from the dynamics of these pseudo ng modes .",
    "the pseudo ng boson itself acquires @xmath268mev  gev@xmath269 masses , remains practically stable , and can be easily overproduced if the coupling between hidden and visible sector is too large .",
    "the fermionic and bosonic partners of the pseudo ng boson , however , acquire @xmath270 masses , decay early in the universe and can reintroduce problems with bbn .",
    "we showed that the model can be phenomenologically viable for large enough @xmath2 breaking scale @xmath216 , and for condensation scales @xmath271@xmath218 , when the coupling to the lighter right - handed neutrinos is suppressed .",
    "an important consequence of gravitino dark matter scenarios with small breaking of matter - parity is that the gravitino decays , producing gamma - ray lines which are potentially observable with instruments like fermi lat .",
    "we found that within our model , large values of the matter - parity violation are favored , since this reduces the lifetime of the problematic pseudo ng modes .",
    "this suggests lifetimes of the gravitino close to the experimental limit , as well as short decay lengths of the nlsp . for a stau nlsp",

    "<S> scenarios where gravitinos with gev masses make up dark matter are known to be in tension with high reheating temperatures , as required by @xmath0 thermal leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> this tension comes from the longevity of the nlsps , which can destroy the successful predictions of the standard primordial nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> however , a small violation of matter parity can open new decay channels for the nlsp , avoiding the bbn problems , while being compatible with experimental cosmic - ray constraints . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a model where matter parity , which we assume to be embedded in the u@xmath1 gauge symmetry , is broken dynamically in a hidden sector at low scales . </S>",
    "<S> this can naturally explain the smallness of the matter parity breaking in the visible sector . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the dynamics of the corresponding pseudo nambu  </S>",
    "<S> goldstone modes of @xmath2 breaking in the hidden sector , and we comment on typical cosmic - ray and collider signatures in our model . </S>"
