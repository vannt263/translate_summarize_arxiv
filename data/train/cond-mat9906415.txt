    "a universal slip law for a moving interface between a solid and a fluid experiencing shear stress , has been demostrated recently @xcite for cases when the no - slip condition breaks down .",
    "experimentally , this situation can be addressed with a piezoelectric ( quartz ) plate , which oscillates in thickness - shear mode while in contact with a fluid medium @xcite .",
    "traditionally , such quartz crystal oscillators have been utilized as a microbalance ( qcm ) for weighing a negligible amount of adsorbed mass in vacuum or in a gaseous environment @xcite .",
    "current applications of the qcm in a vacuum or gas phase range from nanotribology experiments on thin films of solidified gases @xcite to sensor measurements of viscoelastic properties of thin films deposited onto the quartz crystal surface @xcite . in recent liquid phase experiments",
    "@xcite , the qcm technique has been adopted as a biosensor for measuring the properties of adsorbed polymer- and biomolecular films . however , a finite amount of slippage arising from a weak coupling between film and oscillating substrate can change both the resonance frequency @xmath0 and the quality factor @xmath1 of the oscillator and renormalize the results of measurements .",
    "therefore , understanding the role of sliding friction in liquid qcm experiments is of key importance .",
    "an extensive review of the theory of sliding friction and the quartz crystal microbalance method can be found in the recent book by persson @xcite . for a quantitive characterization of slippage effects it is convenient to use the ratio between the shift @xmath2 of the qcm resonance frequency and the inverse quality factor @xmath3 .",
    "this measure was introduced in the qcm literature by krim and widom @xcite as a `` slip time '' @xmath4 , @xmath5 in the following we prefer to refer to the dissipation factor @xmath6 rather than to the inverse quality factor of the oscillator @xcite . the shifts @xmath7 and @xmath2 can be measured simultaneously in qcm experiments ; one always finds @xmath7 to be positive while the resonance frequency shift @xmath2 is negative since mass loading lowers the oscillator resonance frequency compared to the unloaded state in vacuum .    according to the results of krim s",
    "group @xcite , a partial decoupling of the overlayer should occur when @xmath8 .",
    "typically , a quartz crystal oscillates with frequency @xmath9  mhz and therefore decoupling starts when @xmath10  s. for instance , in qcm experiments with thin water films @xcite",
    "@xmath11  hz , @xmath12 and hence @xmath13  s , which is quite close to @xmath14 .",
    "it follows that a relatively low decoupling threshold can lead to noticeable interfacial friction effects even in the case of molecularly thin films .    in the nanotribology qcm - experiments of krim and collaborators , where they studied films of solidified gases , condensed onto a solid substrate @xcite , the interfacial friction coefficient @xmath15 for a thin rigid film",
    "was found to be inversely proportional to the slip time and proportional to the surface mass density @xmath16 of the film , @xmath17 this result can also be viewed as the definition of the slip time @xmath4 , which is @xcite the characteristic time it takes for the film velocity to decrease by a factor @xmath18 .",

    "we use the term `` soft '' to characterize properties which are opposite to  rigid \" , i.e. , the viscoelasticity of the material .",
    "we will show that under certain conditions , the dissipation factor @xmath7 can have a maximum as a function of the viscosity as well as of the sliding friction of the qcm - probed material .",
    "we derive the exact expressions for the maximal dissipation shift .",
    "the general analysis presented here is valid for arbitrary layer thickness .",
    "sliding friction of ultrathin films , adsorbed from a gaseous ( or liquid ) phase , emerges as a special limiting case .    from a practical point of view , one of the particularly important topics treated here is concerned with liquid- and biosensor qcm applications . here",
    "the oscillator , with its adsorbed biomolecular layer , operates in a bulk viscous liquid ( water ) , which provides a natural environment for _ in situ _ measurements .",
    "we have modeled this system as a layered soft ( viscoelastic ) material covered by a bulk newtonian liquid .",
    "linear viscoelasticity of different biological interfaces has been analysed for both maxwell and kelvin / voight schemes and their combination .",
    "let us consider a quartz crystal microbalance ( qcm ) , oscillating in thickness - shear mode and on one side covered by a soft adsorbed layer ( as depicted schematically in fig .  1 ) .",
    "we describe the motion of the qcm as the forced vibration of a damped oscillator driven by periodic force @xcite .",
    "when mass is deposited onto the crystal surface , the resonance frequency changes . for a small amount of mass or a molecularly thin film rigidly attached to the qcm surface , the shift of resonance frequency @xmath2 is proportional to the density @xmath19 and thickness @xmath20 of the overlayer @xcite , while there is no dissipation shift @xmath7 .",

    "the so - called no - slip boundary conditions are valid , i.e. the velocity of the quartz surface is equal to the velocity of the adjacent layer .",
    "below we indicate acoustic characteristics determined in the absence of slippage ( no - slip boundary conditions ) by a tilde sign ( @xmath31 ) over the appropriate symbol .",
    "the shifts in the qcm resonance frequency and in the dissipation factor in the absence of slippage are given by the expressions @xcite @xmath32 and @xmath33    let us now consider the effect of potential slip arising from a weak coupling of film and oscillating substrate . in this case the no - slip boundary condition breaks down and a finite difference between the velocity @xmath34 of the quartz surface and the velocity @xmath35 of the adjacent layer at the interface ( index 0 ) appears leading to an interfacial friction force , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the proportionality coefficient characterizing sliding friction .",
    "it is a constant in the low shear rate approximation .",
    "slippage can also be characterized by a slippage coefficient @xmath39 which is simply the inverse of the sliding friction coefficient @xcite , @xmath40 the no - slip condition corresponds to @xmath41 , while the opposite limit @xmath42 gives infinite slippage and a complete decoupling of the overlayer from the substrate .",
    "effects of slippage can easily be included in the equation of motion for the oscillator . following the damped oscillator model of ref .",
    "@xcite , we may express the shift of resonance frequency and dissipation factor in the presence of slippage as @xmath43 @xmath44 where as already mentioned @xmath45 .",
    "following the approach of krim s group @xcite , we introduce the characteristic slip time @xmath46 as the ratio between the shift of the dissipation factor and the change in resonance frequency change , @xmath47    proceeding by means of an analogy , we define another ratio with dimension of time , @xmath48 in order to characterize the temporal qcm response when no - slip boundary conditions apply .",
    "defined in this way , the characteristic time @xmath49 can be attributed solely to the effects of internal friction ( viscosity ) on the damping of the qcm , i.e , @xmath50 is proportional to the resistive term ( [ eq.five ] ) in the acoustic `` no - slip '' impedance @xmath51 .    using eqs .",

    "one finds @xmath52 and @xmath53    let us consider a viscoelastic medium of finite thickness @xmath20 in contact with the quartz oscillator ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "it is known , that the acoustic response of the oscillator strongly depends on the overlayer thickness .",
    "`` thin '' or `` thick '' films refers to the film thickness being smaller or greater than the inverse values of the decay constant @xmath54 and propagation constant @xmath55 of the acoustic waves propagating in the coated quartz plate @xcite .    in the limiting case of an ultrathin film ( @xmath56 )",
    ", acoustic shear waves can propagate through the adsorbed film without dissipation .",

    ".    the condition ( [ eq.sixteen ] ) is readily understandable . for a non - dissipative medium ,",
    "the damping of the oscillator is proportional to the inertial contribution @xmath69 associated with the slippage of the added mass pushed along the quartz surface",
    ". a rigid thin film will give rise to maximal dissipation when the sliding friction reaches the value @xmath70 or equivalently when the slippage coefficient is @xmath71 this maximum value of the dissipation factor is @xmath72 the lower the surface mass density is , the larger is the slippage coefficient @xmath64 for which the dissipation factor is maximal , and the smaller is this maximal value ( fig .  2 )",
    ". an important consequence of the result  ( [ eq.nineteen ] ) is that the maximum value of the dissipation factor is frequency independent .",
    "therefore , one may consider the presence of such a frequency independent maximum as a test of whether slippage occurs in dynamic qcm measurements ; if the dissipation peak remains constant when the oscillation frequency @xmath73 is varied , the peak can be attributed to sliding friction .",
    "experimentally , the sliding friction is an external parameter which can be changed , e.g. , by varying pressure or temperature .",
    "maxima in the dissipation has been observed experimentally @xcite for solid molecularly thin films sliding along a quartz surface oscillating in gaseous environments .",
    "the maxima appeared when the the condition @xmath74 was met . in these experiments ,",
    "the effect of interfacial friction on the qcm damping was obvious from the fact that viscous losses are negligible both in a gas and in rigid molecularly thin films .",
    "however , in experiments with soft films , the dissipation factor can reach a maximum as temperature or pressure is varied , since these affect the internal friction ( shear viscosity ) of the material .",
    "when slippage is absent ( or negligibly small ) , viscoelastic effects dominate and the dissipation maximum becomes frequency dependent ( see section 3c ) .    in case of sliding thin viscoelastic overlayers , internal friction ( viscosity ) leads to additional but small contributions to the qcm damping since @xmath75 . as a result",
    "the position of the dissipation maximum is only slightly shifted . on the contrary , the viscosity of soft materials of finite thickness will significantly influence the damping and produce a `` viscous''-type dissipation peak . in order to separate these effects",

    "let us derive the acoustic impedance of a qcm covered by an overlayer of highly viscous material .",
    "a very viscous complex fluid responds initially to deformation in the same way as an elastic solid , but after the deformation stops the fluid relaxes .",

    "however , the dissipation in a maxwell fluid includes a term linearly dependent on the film thickness , which appears due to the finite elasticity @xmath160 of the material : @xmath161    finally , we obtain in a similar way the response of a qcm covered by a thin voight / kelvin overlayer when the system operates in a liquid : @xmath162    @xmath163    when @xmath164 , viscoelastic solid and viscoelastic fluid films dissipate the same amount of energy . in the opposite case of @xmath165 , a viscoelastic solid film will dissipate much less energy than will a maxwell fluid film .",

    "this circumstance must be taken into account in qcm adsorption experiments if viscoelastic parameters and the layer thickness can vary simultaneously during adsorption from the liquid phase @xcite .    it should be mentioned , that the qcm characteristics in the case of a maxwell fluid are monotonic functions of film viscoelasticity , decreasing with @xmath77 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "one of the current challenges is to apply the qcm technique to probing biological materials in solution : polymers and complex fluids , which are dominated by viscous effects .",

    "in addition , biosensor applications of the quartz crystal microbalance ( qcm ) technique are faces with the need to control the interfacial friction , when the probed biopolymer material can slip relative to the quartz surface during its oscillatory motion .",
    "the slip of the adjacent layer , affecting the resonance frequency shift @xmath2 and dissipation factor @xmath7 of the oscillator arises from the weak coupling between film and substrate .    the limit of strong coupling of the layer to the solid surface corresponds to the widely used  no - slip \" boundary condition .",
    "experimentally , this boundary condition applies to thin solid films evaporated onto the quartz surface . among biomaterials , the no - slip conditions can easily be realized for langmuir - blodgett films , which can be extremely strongly coupled to the solid substrate .",

    "recent results show that in cases where the adsorbed material forms a soft interface to the quartz crystal microbalance ( qcm ) , both internal and interfacial friction mechanisms may contribute to energy dissipation .",
    "the combined action of these mechanisms may cause the variation of the shift @xmath7 in the dissipation factor to be a nonmonotonic function of material parameters , which can be varied in an experiment . depending on the system , one or the other type of friction may dominate .",
    "we have suggested here a dynamic `` slip / no - slip '' test that can be applied to qcm measurements with thin adsorbed films .",
    "the test is based on the frequency dependence of a peak in the dissipation factor .",
    "we have shown that the peak value of @xmath7 caused by sliding friction is frequency independent while the viscoelasic peak is strongly dependent on frequency .    besides being able to understand the role of interfacial friction , an important problem for the application of the qcm technique to biosensoring remains .",
    "how can the device recognize what type of material is being probed except by detection of an `` anonymous '' deposited mass ? in this article",
    "we suggest that analysing the frequency behavior of qcm characteristics as one of possible test what material is overlayered the quartz surface .",
    "another way is a direct biochemical modification of qcm surface for selective binding of tested biological molecules .",
    "recently , an immunosensing system based on antigen - coated qcm has been reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that qcm results were in agreement with those of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) .",
    "perhaps the successful road to qcm usage as a biosensor device , is to combine both of dynamic measurements and immunology treatment directions .",
    "presented here rigorous formulae for experimentally measured @xmath2 and @xmath7 values , make it possible to investigate viscoelastic contribution in a wide range of biomolecular materials and can be useful for the correct interpretation of biologically oriented qcm experiments .",

    "<S> we analyze theoretically the effect of friction on quartz crystal microbalance ( qcm ) measurements that probe soft ( viscoelastic ) films and biomolecular layers adsorbed from aqueous solutions . while water provides a natural environment for biomolecules , an interface with unknown rheological properties forms between the adsorbed soft molecular layer and the quartz substrate in the latter case . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate therefore the dynamics of soft films adsorbed onto a solid quartz surface within a continuum mechanics approach using both the maxwell and the voight / kelvin models of viscoelasticity and their combination . </S>",
    "<S> the rigorous expressions derived for the acoustic response of a quartz crystal oscillator , accounting for both interfacial ( sliding ) friction and internal friction ( viscosity ) , demonstrate that the qcm can be used as a sensor for quantitative characteristization of friction effects as well as for `` in situ '' measurements of mechanical properties of adsorbed biomolecular films . </S>"
