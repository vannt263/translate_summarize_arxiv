    "the isogal ( prault et al , 1996 ; ojha , omont and simon , 1997 , omont et al , 1999 a , b , c ) project has surveyed a number of fields at low galactic latitude in the intermediate infrared using the isocam ( cesarsky et al . , 1996 ) instrument of the iso satellite .",
    "its aim is the better understanding of the stellar content of the inner galaxy , mostly in very obscured regions .",
    "normally , the filter bands chosen for the observations were lw2 ( 5.58@xmath1 m ) and lw3 ( 1218@xmath1 m ) .",
    "the pixel size was 6 @xmath5 6 arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "the dusty shells surrounding mass - losing late - type stars are expected to be particularly prevalent amongst the objects that should be detected .",
    "these stars will also , in general , be seen by the denis and 2-mass surveys at ijk@xmath7 and jhk@xmath7 respectively .",
    "however , in the more obscured isogal fields , there is little information available concerning individual stars except for those few that are among the most luminous oh / ir sources . for this reason",
    ", it was decided to include some of the relatively unobscured fields known as ",
    "baade s windows \" , located in the inner bulge , in the programme .",
    "these should serve as relatively well surveyed comparison areas .",
    "@xmath8 is thought to average 1.78 @xmath9 0.10 mag in these fields as a whole ( see glass et al , 1995 ) @xmath0 1.45 ) in the part of the ngc6522 window covered by our observations .",
    "the @xmath3 magnitudes that we quote later in this work remain as published by the original authors , who used @xmath10 @xmath0 0.14 mag . ] . in both cases",
    "it will be almost negligible in the lw2 and lw3 bands discussed here and the isogal magnitudes have not been corrected for interstellar extinction .",
    "in particular , we have examined the field located around the globular cluster ngc6522 and that known as sgr i. the late - type stellar contents ( m - stars ) of the first of these fields have been surveyed and classified by blanco , mccarthy and blanco ( 1984 ) ( bmb ) by objective prism , and a smaller portion has been examined similarly by blanco ( 1986 ) to fainter magnitudes .",
    "@xmath11-band photometry is given for the bmb survey , together with an indication of variability , whereas @xmath12-band photometry is provided by blanco ( 1986 ) .",
    "the long - period variable star content of both fields has been surveyed by lloyd evans ( 1976 ; tle ) , using @xmath11-band plates , and he summarizes previous work at visible wavelengths .",
    "infrared ( @xmath13 ) studies of lloyd evans variable stars in ngc6522 and sgr i were carried out by glass and feast ( 1982 ) in order to make use of their period - luminosity relation for determining the distance to the galactic centre .",
    "it was later pointed out by feast ( 1985 ) that many of the iras sources in the sgr i and ngc6522 windows could be identified with known variables .",
    "these were listed by glass ( 1986 ) who showed that the remaining ( unidentified ) iras sources in sgr i were very red at @xmath13 and were also likely to be long - period variables . following this work ,",
    "the known long - period variables and iras sources in the sgr i field were monitored by glass et al ( 1995 ) and periods were confirmed or determined for all sources except one that was non - variable .",
    "the @xmath14 colour - magnitude diagram of the sgr i field shows that the long - period variables are among the reddest and most luminous objects ( glass , 1993 ) at these wavelengths .",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath3 , log@xmath15 relation in sgr i is quite small ( @xmath0 0.35 mag ; glass et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "this implies that most of the agb stars in the field are at a nearly uniform distance , allowing a simple connection to be made between apparent and absolute magnitudes .",
    "photometry of some of the bmb ( 1984 ) stars has been obtained by frogel and whitford ( 1987 ) .",
    "deep near - infrared photometry of the ngc6522 window is presented by tiede , frogel and terndrup ( 1995 ) .",
    "the denis results will form the subject of a separate paper .",
    "the isogal observations were made in the two filters mentioned , as rasters covering squares of 15 @xmath5 15 arcmin@xmath6 orientated in @xmath16,@xmath17 .",
    "they were centered at @xmath16=+1.03@xmath18 , @xmath17=3.83@xmath18 , which includes the globular cluster ngc6522 itself , and at @xmath16=+1.37@xmath18 , @xmath17=2.63@xmath18 in sgr i. each position on the sky was observed for a total of 22s on average .",
    "two rasters of each field were made with the lw2 filter and one with lw3 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the first three digits of each identification indicate the iso revolution number ( @xmath19 day of flight ) .",
    "the second lw2 observation in each case is almost simultaneous with that in lw3 ( within @xmath0 30 min ) .",
    "the images are shown in figs 14 .",
    "the 6@xmath20 pixel field of view was utilised in all cases .",
    ".journal of observations [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath21when known variables are omitted .",
    "if the known variables are omitted the average and rms differences are somewhat reduced . in the case of ngc6522 ,",
    "the known variables show only small differences and do not materially affect the rms values .",
    "the error in the repeatibility of a single 7@xmath1 m observation in either field is thus about 0.14 mag , where we have divided the rms difference columns in tables 6 and 8 by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "no known oh / ir sources fall within our fields ( of 0.063 square degrees each ) .",
    "the density of known oh / ir sources in the part of the sky occupied by our two fields is only 12 per square degree ( sevenster et al . , 1997 ) , though it is higher at the galactic centre ( @xmath010 per square degree for a survey of similar depth ) .",
    "the deepest surveys of the central region indicate that the density of oh / ir stars reaches several hundred per square degree or about 1/3 the number of known large - amplitude variables ( glass et al . , 1999 ) . from their @xmath23 colours ,",
    "the central region sources do not necessarily possess optically thick dust shells at @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether a deeper oh survey of the ngc6522 and sgr i fields would yield detections from the objects with moderate dust shells reported here .",
    "stars detected at both wavelengths are shown in the [ 7][15 ] , [ 15 ] colour - magnitude diagrams ( figs 8 and 9 ) .",
    "the fact that these and similar diagrams discussed below show well - defined sequences implies that they are not significantly contaminated by foreground stars .",
    "it is instructive to see how the [ 7][15 ] colours change with spectral type , bearing in mind that the few miras may vary between late types .",
    "this is shown for the ngc6522 field in fig .",
    "10 , which includes all our sources that have been classified by bmb ( 1984 ) or blanco ( 1986 ) and have been detected in both bands .",
    "note that the fraction of stars satisfying both these criteria is almost zero for the early m - types and almost one for the later .",
    "except for m sub - types 6 , 6.5 and 7 , the numbers are small .",
    "this selection effect arises from the fact that many stars fall below our limit in the 15@xmath1 m band .",
    "the [ 7][15 ] colours of the mira variables are noticeably displaced from the extrapolation of the sequence formed by the remainder of the late m - stars in the isocam colour - magnitude diagrams ( figs .  8 and 9 ) . for miras ,",
    "the relative flux in the 7@xmath1m - band must be greater or that in the 15@xmath1m - band must be weaker or both .",
    "o - rich mira spectra have strong peaks due to the 9.7@xmath1 m and 18@xmath1 m silicate dust emission features .",
    "these are seen clearly in iso - sws spectra ( onaka et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the isocam lw3 band ( 1218 @xmath1 m ) is situated longward of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate band but is strongly influenced for about half of its width by the 18@xmath1 m feature .",
    "so far as is known , the lw3 band is not affected significantly by ( gaseous ) molecular absorption , the most conspicuous feature being the co@xmath24 band at 15.0@xmath1 m , which appears in some o - rich miras ( onaka et al , 1997 ) with small equivalent width .",
    "in many sources an extension of the 10@xmath1 m peak to 13@xmath1 m , attributed to al@xmath24o@xmath25 , may also contribute to the isocam 15@xmath1 m band .",
    "the @xmath4[15 ] colour is primarily a measure of the infrared excess emitted by circumstellar dust shells .",
    "the @xmath4-band flux originates in the stellar photosphere and is only moderately affected ( @xmath26 0.10.2 mag overall ) by co and h@xmath24o absorption bands . as mentioned above , the isocam lw3 band ( 1218 @xmath1 m ) is strongly influenced for about half of its width by the 18@xmath1 m silicate feature .",
    "here we consider those sources detected at 15@xmath1 m which also have ground - based near - infrared observations available from frogel and whitford ( 1987 ) .",
    "spectral classifications by bmb ( 1984 ) or blanco ( 1986 ) are also available for these objects .",
    "figure 11 shows their 15@xmath1 m mag vs @xmath4[15 ] colour and fig .",
    "12 shows the 15@xmath1 m vs m - subtype diagram .    there is a well - defined sequence of increasing 15@xmath1 m luminosity with @xmath3[15 ] colour .",
    "figs 11 and 12 , as well as the other c - m diagrams , show that there is a steady increase of mass - loss from at least the mid - m giants to the miras .",
    "it is also clear , for example by adding up the fluxes from each 15@xmath1 m magnitude band , that the flux from non - miras exceeds that from the miras .",
    "it is therefore also likely that at least half of the mass being returned from the stars to the interstellar medium is from the non - miras .",
    "as pointed out by omont et al ( 1999c , in preparation ) , @xmath3 @xmath0 8.2 corresponds to the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb)(tiede , frogel and terndrup , 1995 ) .",
    "this point corresponds ( fig .",
    "11 ) to @xmath3[15 ] @xmath0 0 or [ 15 ] @xmath0 8.2 . thus stars brighter than [ 15 ] @xmath0 8 are on the agb .",
    "five of the known long - period variables in the ngc6522 field are near the top of the isocam colour - magnitude diagram ( fig .  8) , but are interspersed with other stars that appear similarly luminous and somewhat redder .",
    "ten of the latter stars , brighter than [ 15 ] = 5.7 , were selected for detailed investigation .",
    "they are denoted by letters in table 2 and are visible as red stars on @xmath12 and @xmath11 plates ( lloyd evans , 1976 ) .",
    "they have been re - examined for variability .",
    "although bmb ( 1984 ) assigned very late spectral types and suggested variability , none of the ten stars is , in fact , a large - amplitude variable . however , variability with small amplitude can not be excluded in about half of them .",
    "they therefore represent a type of late m - star with high mass loss but small or zero amplitude of variation .",
    "the colours of four of these stars ( a , c , d and f ) are shown in the @xmath27 , @xmath3 diagram , fig .  7 , where they appear to be similar to 200300 day miras . one of the sample ( star b ) may be mainly at maximum , with occasional faint episodes , while stars a and g could be variables with occasional bright episodes superimposed on a constant background .",
    "such variability in these stars is consistent with differences at 7@xmath1 m between the two observations , especially for star g ( where the change amounts to @xmath0 0.53 mag ) .",
    "for sgr i , as in the case of the ngc6522 field , 12 objects with 15@xmath1 m mags similar to the known miras and somewhat redder colours were checked for variability by lloyd evans on the plate material . in all cases ,",
    "these objects could be identified with very red stars .",
    "only two were found to be fairly certain variables of low amplitude ( f and h ) .",
    "both these stars spend most of their time at maximum , with two fainter episodes separated by about 250 days for f and a single one for h.    the positions of these objects in the [ 7][15 ] , [ 15 ] diagram ( figs . 8 , 9 ) suggest that they form a continuation of the general sequence of late m stars and are not similar to the mira variables .",
    "unfortunately , only four of them , bmb28 , bmb46 ,",
    "bmb86 and bmb179 , have been measured in the near - infrared .",
    "their @xmath3[7 ] indicies are near - zero ( fig .",
    ".    two of these non - mira high mass - loss objects have been classified spectroscopically by bmb ( 1984 ) as m9 , a spectral type that is usually associated with large - amplitude variability .",
    "it is known that the onset of mira - type behaviour occurs at later types with increasing metallicity .",
    "the existence of this class of stars may therefore be a consequence of super metal richness .",
    "alternatively , variability may have ceased temporarily but the dust shells have not yet dissipated .",
    "sloan and price ( 1995 ) and sloan , levan and little - marenin ( 1996 ) have shown that certain irregular and semi - regular agb variables have dust excesses in iras spectra and are associated with the appearance of the 13@xmath1 m dust feature . by obtaining mid - infrared spectra for our objects or by obtaining more precise variability information it will be possible to decide if they are identifiable with this category .",
    "they may also be similar to the ` red ' o - rich srb variables of kerschbaum and hron ( 1996 ) .",
    "the 56 objects of ngc6522 with @xmath28 photometry and spectral classifications are plotted in figure 13 , which shows their @xmath3[7 ] colours and spectral types .",
    "these colours are unexpectedly negative in most cases , especially for the earlier m - subtypes .",
    "while part of this could be due to the small uncertainty in the absolute 7@xmath1 m photometry in crowded fields , iso sws spectra of late - type o - rich m stars frequently show a broad absorption shortward of the strong silicate dust peak at 10@xmath1 m .",
    "this region is known to be affected by the sio fundamental at @xmath0 7.9@xmath1 m ( cohen et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "carefully calibrated spectrophotometry of @xmath29 peg ( m2.5ii  iii ) shows absorption at around 6@xmath1 m attributed to the @xmath2 band of water vapour centred at 6.25@xmath1 m .",
    "spectra of o - rich m - type giants that also demonstrate these features are presented by tsuji et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who envisage that they arise in a warm absorbing layer somewhat above the photosphere .",
    "approximate calculations based on the tsuji et al .",
    "spectra yielded @xmath30[7 ] @xmath0 0.1 for @xmath29 peg but slightly positive @xmath31[7 ] for sw vir ( m7iii ) ",
    "@xmath32 should have values of 0.02 to 0.07 for miras because the @xmath30 band does not include the first overtone band of co. ] .",
    "the presence of significant amounts of dust could be an influence in the latter case .",
    "the depth of the co fundamental band in late m - type giants is known to have a similar effect on the @xmath33 colours , which tend to have low or negative values .",
    "figure 13 shows that in the latest m - type giants the @xmath3[7 ] colour approaches zero or may even become positive .",
    "it is known that the overtone sio absorption band at 3.954.1@xmath1 m is strong in semiregular variables but in miras its strength varies with time and it can become weak ( aringer et al . , 1995 ; rinsland and wing , 1982 ) .",
    "the optical depth of the circumstellar dust in the stars that we are discussing is very low in the earlier spectral types , rising somewhat towards the miras but never becoming high .",
    "the emission at 9.7 and 18@xmath1 m is probably dominated by particles at a fairly uniform temperature around 1000k , where condensation of silicate dust grains first becomes possible in the stellar wind .",
    "thus the 15@xmath1 m fluxes are largely a measure of the mass of grains present and ultimately of the mass - loss rate from the star .",
    "the near - infrared @xmath4 flux will not be affected by _",
    "emission _ from the dust but will be reduced slightly by the _ absorption _",
    "it causes at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the opacity of silicate dust at 7@xmath1 m is very low ( see e.g. schutte and tielens , 1989 ) so that the trend of @xmath4[7 ] colour with spectral type that we observe could partly be caused by increasing extinction at @xmath4 and decreasing sio and possibly h@xmath24o molecular band strengths at 5.58@xmath1 m .",
    "however , dust emission at 7@xmath1 m is certainly responsible for the largest values observed in lpvs , as shown by groenewegen ( private communication ) for various dust models .      in the @xmath3[7 ] , [ 7 ] colour - magnitude diagram ( fig .",
    "14 ) we include the miras from both fields .",
    "it is seen that almost all of the miras are brighter and redder at 7@xmath1 m than the other red giants . a diagram involving the @xmath3[7 ]",
    "colour will therefore be the best criterion for detection of large - amplitude lpvs .",
    "let us recall that , for the class of sources that we detect , the @xmath4 bolometric magnitude correction is practically constant ( @xmath0 3.0 ; groenewegen , 1997 ) . with a distance to the galactic centre of 8.5kpc , @xmath34 @xmath0 @xmath3 - 11.65 .",
    "the brightest stars in our fields therefore have bolometric magnitudes @xmath35 5.9 .",
    "neither field includes any luminous dust - enshrouded agb sources of the type found in the large magellanic cloud by wood et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which reach luminosities of @xmath34 @xmath0 7.5 .",
    "the mira variables show a clear period - colour relation with very moderate scatter in the mid - infrared ( fig .",
    "the [ 7 ] and [ 15 ] photometry is almost simultaneous , so that such scatter as exists is not attributable to variation between measurements . following the discussion in section 7",
    ", this relation confirms that the mass - loss rate in miras is directly related to their periods ( see e.g. , whitelock et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagrams for each of our two fields do not appear to contain any stars brighter than the known miras .",
    "it is therefore likely that the census of stars at the long - period end of the the range is complete and that there is no evidence for long - period variables in our fields with periods longer than those already known , i.e. @xmath0 700 d ( see glass et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "determination of the spatial density distributions of the various stellar populations in the central galaxy , and especially the bulge , is one of the key scientific goals of the isogal project .",
    "a detailed analysis , covering several fields , and with careful consideration of completeness , extinction , etc , is in preparation . for the present",
    "we consider simply the differential number counts between the two fields at magnitudes above the completeness limit . at",
    "[ 15 ] this covers the agb above the rgb - tip , while at [ 7 ] the limit extends approximately one mag below the rgb tip , to [ 7]@xmath36 , using @xmath4  [ 15 ] and @xmath4  [ 7 ] colours from figs 11 and 14 respectively .",
    "the ratio of the surface density of sources is , within the sampling errors , identical for both rgb and agb stars , indicating that there are no steep population gradients apparent .",
    "it is also identical at both [ 7 ] and [ 15 ] microns .",
    "the surface density ratio is @xmath37    this count ratio corresponds to an exponential scale height of 2.0@xmath18 , or @xmath38pc .",
    "that is , the inner bulge minor axis scale height is the same as that of the galactic disk .",
    "a more interesting comparison is with the scale height derived from analysis of the cobe / dirbe surface brightness observations of the inner galaxy .",
    "these have been analysed most completely by binney , gerhard , and spergel ( 1997 ) , whose best - fit model has a bulge density distribution which is a truncated power - law : @xmath39 with @xmath40=1.9kpc , @xmath41=100pc , @xmath42 a normalisation constant , and @xmath43 for ( @xmath44 ) , where @xmath45 is the minor axis distance and @xmath46 an axial ratio , with @xmath47 best fitting the data .",
    "this density profile , which interpolates between the central luminosity spike , which follows an @xmath48 luminosity profile , and the outer bulge , which follows an @xmath49 profile , is also used in the models of kent , dame and fazio ( 1991 ) and the kinematic analysis of ibata and gilmore ( 1995 ) .",
    "it is known to provide an acceptable description of the bulge from latitudes of 4@xmath18 to at least 12@xmath18 .",
    "it remains to be tested at intermediate latitudes .",
    "direct comparison of the isogal data with this function is of specific interest , since the fields surveyed here are included in the cobe / dirbe analysis , and are of low reddening .",
    "the cobe / dirbe data are however integrated light , and so must have a statistical correction for the foreground disk .",
    "this can be a complex function of wavelength and spatial resolution , especially at low latitudes ( see unavane et al .",
    ", 1998 , and unavane and gilmore , 1998 ) for a more complete description ) .",
    "our isogal source counts are however strongly biased against the foreground disk , being dominated by sources in the central galaxy .",
    "thus , the isogal observations test directly the analysis of the integrated light .",
    "our present analysis however does not consider line of sight depth effects in the bulge itself .    with the adopted vertical axis ratio",
    "@xmath50 the predicted count ratio in the isogal data is @xmath51 , somewhat larger than the observed value .",
    "interestingly , near - exact agreement with the model above follows with an axis ratio @xmath52 , which predicts @xmath53 .",
    "this systematic discrepancy between the model and our data is in agreement with the small systematic residuals emphasised to exist by binney et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and shown in their figure 2 .",
    "most of the detected objects are late - type m stars , with a cut - off for those earlier than about m3m4 .",
    "there is a continuous sequence of increasingly mass - losing objects from the mid - m - type giants to the long - period miras , which are the most luminous stars in the field .",
    "there appears to be no component of dust - enshrouded very long - period oh / ir stars or similar objects faint even at @xmath4 in these fields .",
    "the upper limit of luminosities remains at @xmath34 @xmath0 5.7 and the upper limit of periods remains at about 700 days , as determined from near - infrared studies ( glass et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "there is a group of late - type m - stars on the agb which are not large - amplitude variables but may be irregular or of small amplitude , that have luminosities similar to mira variables in the 200300 day period range and show redder [ 7][15 ] but bluer @xmath3[7 ] colours .",
    "the isocam 7@xmath1 m band is almost certainly affected by molecular absorption in ordinary m - giant stars . however , mira variables are brighter than other stars possibly in part because of reduced sio and h@xmath24o absorption",
    ".    the results from these fields should form a template for analyses of more heavily obscured regions about which little is known from visible - light studies .",

    "<S> the isogal mid - infrared survey of areas close to the galactic plane aims to determine their stellar content and its possible bearing on the history of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the ngc6522 and sgr i baade s windows of low obscuration towards the inner parts of the bulge represent ideal places in which to calibrate and understand the isogal colour - magnitude diagrams , which are more difficult to interpret in heavily reddened fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the survey observations were made with the isocam instrument of the iso satellite . </S>",
    "<S> the filter bands chosen were lw2 ( @xmath07@xmath1 m ) and lw3 ( @xmath015@xmath1 m ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here show that most of the detected objects are late m - type giants on the agb , with a cut - off for those earlier than m3m4 . </S>",
    "<S> the most luminous members of these two bulge fields at 7@xmath1 m are the mira variables . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is evident that they represent the end of a sequence of increasing 15@xmath1 m dust emission which commences with m giants of earlier sub - type .    in observations of late - type giants the isocam 15@xmath1 m band is mainly sensitive to the cool silicate or aluminate dust shells which overwhelm the photospheric emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , in ordinary m - giant stars , the 7@xmath1 m band is not strongly affected by dust emission and may be influenced instead by absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 band of water at 6.25@xmath1 m and the sio fundamental at 7.9@xmath1 m are likely contributors to this effect . </S>",
    "<S> miras are more luminous at 7@xmath1 m and have redder @xmath3[7 ] colours than other m giants . </S>",
    "<S> their [ 7][15 ] colours are consequently bluer than might be expected by extrapolating from warmer m - giants .    a group of late m stars has been found which vary little or not at all but have infrared colours typical of well - developed dust shells . </S>",
    "<S> their luminosities are similar to those of 200300 day miras but they have slightly redder [ 7][15 ] colours which form an extension of the ordinary m giant sequence . </S>",
    "<S> they may belong to the class of red semi - regular variables .    </S>",
    "<S> the mira dust shells show a mid - infrared [ 7][15 ] colour - period relation .    in these two fields </S>",
    "<S> there is no component of high - luminosity late - type variables obscured at @xmath4 and shorter wavelengths such as is seen in the magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit of lpv periods in these fields remains at _ ca _ 700 days .    </S>",
