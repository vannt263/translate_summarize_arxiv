    "harris and morrison ( @xcite , p.138 ) define the flat completion problem for embedded families of curves as the determination of all curves in @xmath3 that can arise as flat limits of a family of embedded stable curves over the punctured disc .",
    "the problem mentioned in the first paragraph contains the isotrivial case of the flat completion problem for plane curves , and a solution to it can in fact be found in the marvelous article  @xcite by the italian mathematician aldo ghizzetti ( a summary of the results is contained in  @xcite ) .",
    "however , as we will explain below , our main application requires a more refined type of information ; thus our aim is somewhat different than ghizzetti s , and we can not simply lift his results . consequently , our work in this paper is independent of @xcite . in any case ,",

    "the enumerative geometry of families of plane curves with prescribed singularities presents a notoriously difficult problem .",

    "consider the special case where the family consists of a completely arbitrary plane curve and all its translates . in our paper",
    "@xcite we explained how the degree of this family , in other words , the number of curves in the family passing through the appropriate number of general points in the plane , can be computed .",
    "for example , for a nonsingular curve @xmath1 this family is the set of all possible embeddings of @xmath1 in @xmath4 ; our motivation in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the present article is the study of this set , and of its natural generalization for arbitrary plane curves .",
    "the starting point of our method is to view the action map on @xmath1 as a rational map @xmath5 from the @xmath6 of @xmath7 matrices to the @xmath3 of plane curves of degree @xmath2 .",
    "we require a precise description of the closure of the graph of @xmath5 , specifically of the scheme - theoretic inverse image of the locus of indeterminacy .",
    "this is the exceptional divisor of the blow - up of @xmath6 along the base scheme of @xmath5 , the projective normal cone ( pnc ) . a set - theoretic description of the components of the pnc amounts to a solution of the ( isotrivial ) flat completion problem , together with careful bookkeeping of the different arcs in @xmath6 used to obtain each limit .",
    "the pnc can be viewed as an arc space associated to the rational map @xmath5 ; it is probably possible to recast our analysis in  [ setth ] in the light of recent work on arc spaces ( cf .",
    "for example @xcite ) , and it would be interesting to do so .",
    "in fact a set - theoretic description of the pnc does not suffice for our enumerative application in @xcite .",
    "this requires the full knowledge of the pnc _ as a cycle , _ that is , the determination of the multiplicity of its different components .",
    "thus , we determine not only the limits of one - dimensional families of translates of @xmath1 , but we also classify such families up to a natural notion of equivalence and we keep track of the behavior of a family near the limit . the determination of the limits and the classification are contained in  [ setth ] . as may be expected , the determination of the multiplicities is quite delicate ; this is worked out in  [ multi ] .",

    "the final result of our analysis is stated in  2 of @xcite , in the form of five ` facts ' .",
    "the proofs of these facts are spread over the present text ; we recommend comparing loc.cit .  with  [ statement ] and  [ multstat ] to establish a connection between the more detailed statements proved here and the summary in @xcite .",

    "we note that , by the same token , every limit attained by one of our ` germs ' can conversely be realized as the flat limit of a family parametrized by a curve @xmath16 mapping to @xmath6 , as above ; and in fact we can even assume @xmath28 . indeed , truncating @xmath19 at a high enough power does not affect @xmath29 , and a polynomial @xmath19 describes a map @xmath30 .",

    "the first concerns a recurrent tool in establishing that a germ @xmath19 does not contribute a component to the pnc . as we discussed in",
    " [ rank2obs ] , this is the case for ` rank-2 limits ' , that is , limits that can also be obtained by germs entirely contained within the locus of rank-2 transformations in @xmath6 . since we are looking for germs determining components of @xmath39 , we may ignore such ` rank-2 limits ' and the germs that lead to them .",
    "[ rank2lemma ] assume that @xmath71 has rank  @xmath137 . if @xmath138 is a star with center on @xmath113 , then it is a rank-2 limit .",
    "assume @xmath139 is a star with center on @xmath113 .",
    "we may choose coordinates so that @xmath83 is the kernel line and the generator for the ideal of @xmath77 is a polynomial in @xmath140 only . if @xmath141 then @xmath142 for @xmath143 since @xmath71 has rank  1 and kernel line @xmath83 , @xmath144 now @xmath45 is contained in the rank-2 locus , verifying the assertion .",
    "a limit @xmath138 as in the lemma will be called a ` kernel star ' .",
    "a second tool will be at the root of our reduction process : we will replace a given germ @xmath19 with a different one in a more manageable form , but leading to the same component of the pnc in a very strong sense .",
    "[ equivgerms ] two germs are ` equivalent ' with respect to @xmath1 if they are ( possibly up to an invertible change of parameter ) fibers of a family of germs with constant center and limit . more precisely , two germs @xmath145 , @xmath146 are equivalent if there exists a connected curve  @xmath147 , a regular map @xmath148 \\to { { \\mathbb{p}}}^8 $ ] , two points @xmath149 , @xmath150 of @xmath147 , and a unit @xmath151 $ ] such that :    * @xmath152 ; * @xmath153 ; * @xmath154 is constant ; * if @xmath155 \\to { { \\mathbb{c}}}^9 $ ] is a lift of @xmath156 , then @xmath157 for some @xmath158 , with @xmath159 a nowhere vanishing function and @xmath160 a nonzero polynomial in @xmath161 independent of @xmath162 .",
    "it is clear that definition  [ equivgerms ] gives an equivalence relation on the set of germs : reflexivity and symmetry are immediate , and transitivity is obtained by joining two families along a common fiber ( note that the limit @xmath160 and the weight @xmath158 are determined by any of the fibers of a family , hence they are the same for any two families extending a given germ ) .",
    "note the possible parameter change in the second condition : this guarantees that a germ @xmath19 is equivalent to any of its reparametrizations @xmath163",
    ". this flexibility will play an important rle in part of our discussion , especially in  [ inessential ] and ff .    by lemma  [ excdivsupp ] , the third and fourth conditions amount to the statement that all germs @xmath164 lift to germs in @xmath52 , the closure of the graph of @xmath5 , centered at the same point .",
    "if @xmath165 , @xmath166 are centered at a point of @xmath38 , then @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( and in fact all the intermediate @xmath167 ) determine the same point in the projective normal cone .",
    "thus , equivalent germs can be ` continuously deformed ' one into the other while holding the center of their lift in @xmath48 fixed .",
    "typically , the curve @xmath147 will simply be a chain of affine lines , minus some points .",
    "given an arbitrary germ @xmath19 , we will want to produce an equivalent and ` simpler ' germ",
