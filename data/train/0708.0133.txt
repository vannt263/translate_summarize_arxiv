    "l1157-mm is a class 0 protostar located at 440 pc , with a mass of @xmath7 0.12 @xmath8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , driving a spectacular bipolar outflow .",
    "the outflow has been studied in detail through many molecular lines , such as co ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , sio ( @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , h@xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , nh@xmath0 @xcite , and ch@xmath0oh ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    with respect to other outflows driven by low - mass protostars",
    ", l1157 stands out for its rich mm - wave spectrum and it can be considered as the prototype of chemically active outflows . @xcite have mapped the l1157 outflow in many molecular mm - emission lines and six low - velocity molecular clumps have been detected along the lobes .",
    "these clumps have strong emission due to molecular species which increase their abundances only when a shock - induced chemistry is active @xcite .",
    "two main shock events have been detected in the blue lobe of the outflow and the interferometric image of the co ( 10 ) line @xcite reveals the presence of two prominent limb - brightened cavities created by the propagation of large bow - shocks .",
    "the different orientation of the two cavities testifies the precession of the driving , highly - collimated jet .",
    "clumpiness in chemically active outflows has been studied recently ( @xcite ; @xcite ) by fitting the line profiles of several species by the use of a chemical and a radiative transfer model .",
    "these studies indicate that the size derived from single dish observations ( @xmath7 0.12 pc for cb3 and @xmath7 0.04 pc for l1157 ) are upper limits and that the clumps contain substructures . in absence of observational evidence of the structure of the low velocity clumps in outflow , @xcite and",
    "@xcite assumed the density profile derived for starless cores in their modelling .",
    "however , the outflow clumps show fundamental differences with respect to starless cores , for example in the temperature ( starless cores have temperature @xmath9 10 k ) and in the chemical structure ( in starless cores most of the molecular material is depleted toward the center of the core )",
    ". direct evidence of the real structure of these low velocity clumps can only be obtained via very high spatial resolution observations using an interferometer .    in order to investigate the small scale structure of the low velocity clumps in outflows we carried out interferometric observations of the nearby l1157 outflow with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) and",
    "the results are presented in this paper .",
    "we mapped the blue lobe , which is the richest in terms of molecular emission , in a sub  sample of the species already observed with the iram-30 m single dish in this outflow .",
    "in particular , we selected molecules that are high density tracers ( as cs , hcn and hc@xmath0n ) and whose chemical abundance is significantly affected by the presence of a no  dissociative shock ( as ch@xmath0oh and ocs ) .",
    "the observations are described in sect .",
    "we present the results and the calculation of the column densities in sect . 3 and in sect .",
    "4 , respectively .",
    "the results are discussed in sect .",

    ", the methanol column density shows a higher value , 1.2@xmath1410@xmath18 @xmath16 , in b1b with respect to the typical value of the other clumps , ( 25)@xmath1410@xmath19 @xmath16 . on the contrary ,",
    "the hcn column density has one of the lowest values 5@xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16 in b1b while it is higher in b1a and b1c , @xmath7 2@xmath1410@xmath19 @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath5so column density is @xmath7 3@xmath1410@xmath17 @xmath16 in b1a and b1c while it is slightly higher , ( 89)@xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16 , in b1b and b1d . in all the species ,",
    "the column densities in b2a and b2b have similar values and are lower than the values in b1 . note , however , that the size of the clumps where the column densities are calculated are larger in b2a and b2b than in the other clumps .",
    "the column densities derived by merging our pdbi data with previously obtained iram-30 m data for hcn and ch@xmath0oh are similar ( difference of 10% on average ) to the values derived by @xcite in b1 and b2 using only single dish iram-30 m data .",
    "this shows that most of the large scale emission filtered out by the interferometer has been recovered adding the single dish data to the interferometric data .",
    "the two species for which the single dish data have been added to the interferometric data , namely hcn and ch@xmath0oh , show the presence of a diffuse gas component that matches the morphology of the blue lobe observed in other species such as co , cs , sio and so ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our high spatial resolution maps show that the outflow emission is indeed continuous , with a number of local peaks .",
    "in fact , the large clumps detected by previous single dish observations have been resolved into several smaller clumps and few new clumps have been detected along the lobe .",
    "these findings confirm what suggested by previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that several gas components are present in the low velocity molecular clumps observed in chemically active outflows with single dish telescopes .",
    "two main structures are identified ( see fig .",
    "[ all_lobe ] ) : the southern one is associated with the b2 clumps and the northern one is associated with the b0 and b1 clumps .",
    "these two structures of diffuse molecular gas are associated with the two cavities identified in the co ( 10 ) map of @xcite .",
    "the two cavities have probably been created by the propagation of large bow - shocks due to a highly collimated , precessing jet . it is worth noting the two continuous structures perpendicular to the flow axis : the first connecting b0a , b0c and b0d and the second slightly to the north at the level of b0b ; they seem to be detected in hcn and ch@xmath0oh as well as co. the nature of these structures remains unclear .    in fig .",
    "[ cavity ] we show the cs ( 21 ) and ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath31@xmath3)a@xmath4 maps superimposed to the co ( 10 ) map .",
    "the clumps identified in our maps are located at the walls of the c2 cavity . in particular ,",
    "b0a and b0e trace the east wall , b0b and b0d trace the west wall and the arch - shaped b1a , b1b , b1c and b1d clumps are located at the apex of the cavity .",
    "our maps support the scenario that the cavity was created by the propagation of large bow - shock , showing the presence of clumpy structures at the walls of the cavity with the arch - shaped clumps at the apex that may trace the front of the bow - shock .",
    "the situation in the older c1 cavity is less clear since this cavity is less defined in the co map .",
    "however , it seems that the b2a and b2b clumps trace the west wall of the cavity .",
    "the observed species peak in different parts of the c2 cavity .",
    "considering also other interferometric maps found in the literature [ sio ( 21 ) , spatial resolution @xmath7 2.5 arcsec @xcite and nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) , ( 1,1 ) , spatial resolution @xmath7 5 arcsec @xcite ] , we can identify two groups of molecules , one peaking in the west - side and the other peaking in the east - side . in particular , the east clumps b0a , b0e , b1a and b1c are brighter in hc@xmath0n ( 1110 ) , hcn ( 10 ) , cs ( 21 ) and nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) and sio ( 21 ) while the west clumps b0b , b0d and b1b are brighter in ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath11@xmath1 ) , ocs ( 76 ) and @xmath5so ( 3@xmath62@xmath3 ) .",
    "this peak displacement in the line emission suggests an inhomogeneity in the physical and chemical conditions of the observed clumps .",
    "the different behaviour between the east and west parts of the map is also clear from the column densities ( see table [ column ] ) .",
    "n(cs ) and n(hc@xmath0n ) are quite constant in all the clumps ; n(hcn ) is higher in the east clumps while n(ch@xmath0oh ) , n(ocs ) and n(@xmath5so ) are higher in the west clumps . in particular",
    ", the ocs and ch@xmath0oh column density shows the highest value in b1b while here the hcn column density assumes its lowest value .",
    "the @xmath5so column density is slightly higher in b1b and b1d than in b1a and b1c . despite the large uncertainties associated with the derived column densities , these differences suggest that a chemical differentiation is present among the clumps associated with the c2 cavity . in particular ,",
    "the n(ch@xmath0oh)/n(cs ) ratio is higher in the west part ( 38 in b0d , 29 in b1b and 16 in b1d ) than in the east part ( 6 in b1a and b1c and 4 in b0e ) ( see fig . [ cavity ] ) .",
    "similarly n(@xmath5so)/n(cs ) is higher in the west ( 0.20 in b1b and 0.29 in b1d ) than in the east ( 0.06 in b1a and 0.04 in b1c ) .",
    "since the cs column density is quite constant throughout the map , the difference in the ratio is an indication of an higher chemical abundance of methanol and sulfur oxide in the west part of c2 cavity , especially in b1b for ch@xmath0oh and in b1d for @xmath5so .",
    "this result is independent on the assumption that the temperature of 80 k is constant throughout the b1 clump .",
    "in fact , 80 k was derived from the non uniform nh@xmath0 ( 3,3)/(1,1 ) line ratio by @xcite .",
    "in particular , the reference value of 80 k is suitable for the east clumps where the ammonia peaks but it may not be suitable for methanol , which peaks in the west .",
    "however , by changing the temperature from 10 k to 200 k , the methanol column density changes only by a factor of 3 , and the n(ch@xmath0oh)/n(cs ) ratio is always significantly higher at west than at east .",
    "the asymmetry in the line emission is particularly evident in b1 . in fig [ sio_met ]",
    "we compare the emission of cs ( 21 ) , ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath31@xmath3)a@xmath4 and sio ( 21 ) .",
    "cs and sio , as well as nh@xmath0 @xcite , show a similar behaviour , peaking @xmath7 10 arcsec east of the peak of ch@xmath0oh . since the b1 clump is located at the apex of the bow shock produced by the second shock episode , it is particularly interesting to note the different spatial distribution of the sio , nh@xmath0 , and ch@xmath0oh molecules that are common shock tracers .",
    "sio ( 2 - 1 ) and ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath11@xmath1 ) are expected to be excited by the same physical conditions since their critical density and excitation temperature are similar ( n@xmath20 10@xmath21 @xmath22 and t@xmath23 415 k ) .",
    "it is then probable that a different chemistry is at the origin of the observed displacement , although small differences of the gas density and temperature are also possible between the subclumps . in fact ,",
    "methanol and ammonia are abundant on grain ice mantles @xcite and they evaporate in the gas phase as the temperature increases above @xmath7 120 k @xcite , while sio is rapidly formed in the gas phase after the sputtering of significant amounts of silicon from the dust grains in c - shock with speeds larger than 25 km s@xmath24(@xcite ; @xcite ) . since the efficiency of the si sputtering increases with the velocity of the shock",
    ", the higher brightness of the sio emission in the eastern part of the c2 cavity might suggest that the velocity of the shock is higher in the east wall of the cavity with respect to the west wall .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that , in general , the terminal velocity of the blue wing for the observed lines is higher , from 4 up to 10 km s@xmath24 , for the eastern clumps than for the western clumps ( see fig .",
    "[ spettri ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the chemical models developed for the low - velocity molecular clumps in outflows @xcite show that the methanol chemical abundance is higher in models with high gas density .",
    "in particular , the abundance increases by more than one order of magnitude as the gas density increases from 10@xmath25 @xmath22 to 10@xmath21 @xmath22 ( see table 5 and fig . 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the west clumps might have a slightly higher density , n@xmath26 @xmath7 10@xmath21 @xmath22 , than the mean value n@xmath26 = 3@xmath1410@xmath25 @xmath22 derived in b1 from the lvg fitting of the sio lines observed with the iram-30 m and jcmt telescopes @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry in the emission of the shock tracing species may be explained in the framework of the morphology of the blue lobe of the l1157 outflow .",
    "the lobe is composed by two big cavities created by two subsequent bow shocks driven by a precessing jet @xcite : the first shock episode is associated with the c1 cavity and the southern clumps and the second shock episode is associated with the c2 cavity and the northern clumps .",
    "the model by @xcite found that the jet precesses on a cone with opening angle of 6@xmath27 and that the c1 cavity lies mainly on the plane of the sky while c2 is elongated towards us and towards the west .",
    "they also found that between the two shocks the jet precessed a quarter of the rotation period . due to the precession of the jet axis from east to west",
    ", the west wall of the c2 cavity is expanding into the denser medium of the harboring molecular cloud while the east wall is expanding in a medium already swept - up by the older shock episode .",
    "therefore chemical differentiations between the east and west clumps are expected because of the different physical conditions of the pre  shock gas . in this scenario",
    "one would expect a higher sio abundance at east , where we observe a higher velocity , and higher ch@xmath0oh abundance at west , where the density is likely to be higher . on the other hand , the change of the outflow inclination with respect to the plane of the sky between the two shock episodes , even if quite small ( @xmath7 6@xmath27 ) ,",
    "could imply that the eastern part of b1 may intersect the dense wall of the previously formed c1 cavity .",
    "if this is the case , one would expect a higher gas density at the east of b1 , i.e. an opposite scenario with respect to the previous one .",
    "a similar puzzling finding is observable in the south part of b1 where a linear structure of diffuse emission is detected in cs ( 2 - 1 ) and in sio ( 2 - 1 ) but not in ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath31@xmath3)a@xmath4 ( see fig . [ sio_met ] ) .",
    "also in this case cs and sio trace the same gas component and they are decoupled from the methanol emission .",
    "@xcite suggested that the sio finger , that lies along the jet direction , traces the magnetic precursor of the shock .",
    "an enhancement of the sio abundance due to the interaction of the magnetic and/or radiative precursor of the shock with the ambient gas has also been observed in the l1148-mm outflow @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that a displacement between the ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath31@xmath3 ) and sio ( 21 ) emission has been also observed in the outflow driven by the high  mass protostar iras 20126 + 4104 ( @xcite , see their fig .",
    "also in this case , the authors interpret such displacement by the light of the outflow precession with the methanol abundance increased as a consequence of the entrainment of the surrounding high density cloud . in conclusion ,",
    "the real nature of the observed displacement of the shock tracer species in b1 can be explained only with a proper determination of the actual physical conditions ( density as well as temperature ) of the clumps . in particular , to this aim observations of higher excitation cs transitions are needed to constrain possible density variations .",
    "high spatial resolution maps of the blue lobe of the l1157 outflow , obtained with the pdbi have been presented .",
    "the blue lobe has been mapped in ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath11@xmath1 ) , hc@xmath0n ( 1110 ) , hcn ( 10 ) and ocs ( 76 ) at a spatial resolution of @xmath7 6@xmath145 arcsec@xmath28 . moreover , the bright b1 clump has also been observed in cs ( 21 ) , ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath31@xmath3)a@xmath4 , and @xmath5so ( 3@xmath62@xmath3 ) at higher spatial resolution of @xmath7 3@xmath143 arcsec@xmath28 .",
    "these observations show a very rich structure in all the tracers , revealing a clumpy structure of the gas , richer than the one observed in previous single dish observations .",
    "we detect new clumps , labeled b0b , b0d , and b2c .",
    "moreover , the previously known b0 , b1 and b2 clumps have been resolved into three ( b0a , b0c , b0e ) , four ( b1a , b1b , b1c and b1d ) and two ( b2a and b2b ) sub - clumps , respectively .",
    "these results confirm that the shocked molecular gas in chemically active outflows is mainly structured in small clumps with size of the order of 0.02  0.04 pc .",
    "the two southern clumps ( b2a and b2b ) of the blue lobe of the l1157 outflow appear similar both in the line intensity and the elongated shape ( 20@xmath1410 arcsec@xmath28 ) .",
    "they show observational properties slightly different with respect to the other clumps , probably due to their older age .",
    "the northern clumps ( b0a , b0b , b0c , b0d , b0e , b1a , b1b , b1c and b1d ) have typical size of 10  15 arcsec and they are located at the walls of the c2 cavity formed by the propagation of a bow shock , with the b1 sub - clumps tracing the apex of the bow shock and the b0 sub - clumps located in the wake of the shocked region where the matter has already been affected by the passage of the shock .",
    "the observed species peak in different parts of the cavity . by taking into consideration other interferometric maps found in the literature , we identify two groups of molecules : hc@xmath0n , hcn , cs , nh@xmath0 and sio peak at the west - side and ch@xmath0oh , ocs and @xmath5so peak at the east - side of the cavity .",
    "this peak displacement is also clear from the column densities and suggests an inhomogeneity in the physical conditions and/or chemical composition of the observed clumps .",
    "the observed asymmetry may be related to the precession of the outflow : because of the precession of the outflow axis from east toward west , the west wall of the c2 cavity is expanding into the denser medium of the harboring molecular cloud so the velocity of the shock may be lower and the density of the clumps higher than at the east wall which is expanding in a medium already swept - up by the older shock episode .",
    "however , other hypotheses can not be ruled out , therefore the determination of the nature and the physical conditions of the clumps require further high spatial resolution observations and the use of a detailed chemical and shock model .",
    "finally , we note that the shocked gas in the l1157 outflow will be extensively studied by the pacs and hifi instruments on board the _ herschel _ satellite , that will be launched in 2008 . in particular , the blue lobe is the chosen position of an unbiased spectral survey in the @xmath7 4501990 ghz window with a spatial resolution ranging from @xmath7 9 to 46 arcsec . even if the _ herschel _ observations will be at lower spatial resolution with respect to the interferometric data presented here , the multiline analysis of data from the millimeter to the far - infrared spectral range will allow to trace all the gas excitation from few tens to few thousands of kelvin and to fully constraint the physical properties of the warm gas components along the chemically active l1157 outflow .",
