    "however , if she plays game a twice , then game b twice and so on ( game c ) , or if she chooses the game at random with probability @xmath37 ( game d ) , her fortune will tend to @xmath38 .",
    "this is parrondo s paradox and it is illustrated in figure [ fig : parrondo ] .",
    "now consider game c , where the player alternates between game a and game b , i.e. , she plays game a once , then game b once , and so on .",
    "what happens in this case ?",
    "the answer will be given at the end of example [ ex : periodic2 ] .",
    "games a and b are particular cases of random walks in a random environment , while games c and d are examples of regime switching markov chains in random environment .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study their asymptotic behavior .",
    "one of the first rigorous work in this field is @xcite , who studied some particular cases of random environment , namely the so - called periodic case , where each random walk is like in game b , while the player chooses at random between two games .",
    "the author also consider some `` deterministic '' mixtures , namely the cases studied in @xcite . for other kind of random walks in random environment that are not covered by our setting , see e.g. , @xcite .    in what follows , the player chooses the game to play according to a finite markov chain , and each game is a random walk in a random environment , extending the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the model is described in the next section , together with characterizations of their asymptotic behavior . in section [ sec : rsrwre ] , the model , which is basically a regime switching random walks in random environments is described and one of the main results ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) is stated , namely that these models behave like simple random walks , in the sense that they are transient , meaning that they converge to either of @xmath39 with probability @xmath40 , for almost every environment , or they are recurrent , meaning that the limsup and liminf converge respectively to @xmath39 with probability @xmath40 , for almost every environment . in section",
    "[ sec : hitting ] , the three possible cases are characterized in terms of the rank of the transition matrix and the dimensions of some random subspaces occurring in the famous oseledec s theorem .",
    "these results generalize the best known particular cases : ( i ) when the games are chosen independently , the transition matrix has rank @xmath40 , and the results can be recovered as well from standard arguments applied to random walks in random environments @xcite ; ( ii ) the periodic choices studied by many authors , starting with @xcite , where the transition matrices have full rank . finally , the proofs of the results can be found in a series of appendices .",
    "they are inspired by the results of @xcite who studied random walks in random environments with bounded increments but no regime switching .",
    "the results of @xcite were later refined by @xcite .",
    "we first describe the model and then study its asymptotic behavior .",
    "first , let @xmath41 be a complete probability space with a measure preserving transformation @xmath42 , assumed to be @xmath43-measurable and ergodic , i.e. , the @xmath42-invariant sigma - field is trivial .",

    "her decision process is based on the irreducible markov chain @xmath54 on @xmath55 , with transition matrix @xmath56 .",
    "for example , in game c , one can choose @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the ( deterministic ) process determined by game a , @xmath61 is the stationary ergodic process determined by game b , and @xmath62 . for game",

    "* remark 2 ) .",
