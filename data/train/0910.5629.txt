    "the lorentz transformations of special relativity can be derived from the principle of special relativity alone , _ without _ assuming the constancy of the speed of light ( see friedman(2004 ) , ch .",
    "this approach was applied to the transformations between two _ uniformly accelerated _ systems in friedman and gofman ( 2004 ) and ( 2010 ) .",
    "the resulting description follows from the generalized principle of relativity and the ensuing symmetry .",
    "we replace the space - time description of events by the proper velocity - time description .",
    "the proper velocity @xmath5 of an object is the derivative of the object s displacement with respect to the proper time .",
    "in other words , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the object s velocity and @xmath8 . a system @xmath9 is called _ uniformly accelerated _ with respect to an inertial system",
    "@xmath10 if it moves parallel to it with constant acceleration @xmath11 ( see moller ( 1972)and franklin ( 2010 ) ) . in the proper velocity - time description of events ,",
    "the transformation between uniformly accelerated systems become linear .",
    "we have shown , friedman and gofman ( 2010 ) , that there are only two types of transformations between uniformly accelerated systems .",
    "the validity of the _ clock hypothesis _ is crucial to determining which one of the two types of transformations is obtained .",
    "the clock hypothesis in einstein ( 1911 ) states that the rate of an accelerated clock is equal to that of a comoving unaccelerated clock . if the clock hypothesis is valid , then the transformations between uniformly accelerated systems are galilean .",
    "if not , these transformations are of lorentz - type , and , moreover , there exists a universal maximal acceleration , which we denote by @xmath0 .",
    "if the clock hypothesis is false , then the transformation between uniformly accelerated systems depends only on the relative acceleration @xmath12 between the systems .",
    "if the acceleration @xmath12 is chosen in the direction of the @xmath13-axis , the proper velocity - time transformations are @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the time dilation due to the acceleration .",
    "the form @xmath16 is an invariant for uniformly accelerated systems .",
    "this implies that the acceleration @xmath17 of any massive object is limited by the maximal one @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the proper velocity time trajectory of such objects is inside the `` light cone '' @xmath19 in the proper velocity time continuum . as in special relativity",
    ", the radiation generated by non - massive particles , will propagate on the boundary of the cone and thus be described by @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the main feature of special relativity is that the set of all relativistically allowed velocities is a ball @xmath22 of radius @xmath1 , the speed of light .",
    "the relativistic dynamics ( rd ) describe motions which preserve this limitation . in special relativity the magnitude of the acceleration is unlimited , and the clock hypothesis holds .",
    "but , if the clock hypothesis is not true , the allowed accelerations belong to a ball @xmath23 of radius @xmath0 .",
    "we extend rd to an _ extended relativistic dynamics _ ( erd ) , a theory in which the speed of any moving object is limited by @xmath1 and the magnitude of its acceleration is limited by @xmath0 .",
    "newton s classical dynamics law @xmath24 can be rewritten as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the momentum of the moving object .",
    "the relativistic dynamics equation ( rindler ( 2004 ) ) is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the proper velocity of the object and @xmath29 is the rest - mass of the object . in friedman ( 2007 ) it was shown that this dynamics equation can be derived from the boundness of the speed of a moving object by @xmath1 . introducing the relativistic momentum @xmath30 the rd equation",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath31    note that rd equation brake the born s reciprocity , which state  the laws of nature are symmetrical with regard to space and momentum \" . in the above system , the derivative of the space in the first equation is by the proper time ( including the time dilation due to the velocity of the moving object ) , while the derivative of the momentum in the second equation is by the lab time . in erd",
    "we introduce in the second equation the time dilation by a factor due to the acceleration of the object @xmath32 , defined by ( [ gama_accel ] ) , with @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the erd equation become @xmath33 this equation can be derived also from boundness of the acceleration , as the rd equation is derived in friedman ( 2007 ) from the boundness of the velocity .",
    "to obtain a hamilton type equations for erd , we define now for each , @xmath34 , a function @xmath35 and its inverse by @xmath36 with this notation , denoting @xmath37 , we can rewrite ( [ erd original ] ) as @xmath38 or @xmath39    this turns the erd equation into a non - linear first order system of differential equations : @xmath40 if @xmath41 is smooth , then , by a theorem of differential equations , a solution of the above system exists and is unique for any initial conditions @xmath42 . moreover , from ( [ est dym system ] ) it follows directly that the solution satisfies the limitations of erd : latexmath:[\\[|\\mathbf{v}|=\\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt}\\right|\\leq c,\\;\\ ;    acceleration @xmath17 of any massive object is limited by the maximal one , @xmath18 .",
    "the proper velocity time trajectory of such objects is inside the `` light cone '' @xmath19 in @xmath44 .",
    "the zero - mass particles propagate on the boundary of the cone .    to transform the system ( [ est dym system ] ) into a hamilton type system",
    ", we introduce the relativistic momentum @xmath45 and a phase space @xmath46 .",
    "then , we can rewrite the esr dynamics equations as a hamilton type system on the phase space : @xmath47 this form of the equation define also the dynamics of zero - mass particles .",
    "the equations are similar for both @xmath48 and @xmath49 as suggested by borns s reciprocity .",
    "the system becomes a hamilton system if there is a hamiltonian @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 and @xmath52 the solution of ( [ hamilton condition 1 ] ) is @xmath53 for some function @xmath54 . substituting this expression into ( [ hamilton condition 2 ] ) shows that a hamiltonian can be found only if @xmath55 does not depend on @xmath49 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath56 and the hamiltonian is @xmath57 where @xmath54 is defined by ( [ potential energy ] ) the first term of the hamiltonian coincides with the usual relativistic energy of a free particle , while the second term is the potential energy .",
    "consider first the harmonic oscillator , an object of mass @xmath58 affected by a force @xmath59 for some constant @xmath60 . in this case , the esr potential energy , defined by equation ( [ potential energy ] ) , is @xmath61 which has a solution @xmath62 where we chose the free constant which gives @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath64 , then expanding the square root into a power series yields @xmath65 which shows the approximation to non - relativistic potential energy of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "consider another example : the motion of an object of mass @xmath58 in a central field , with force @xmath66 , for some constant @xmath60 .",
    "in this case , the esr potential energy , defined by equation ( [ potential energy ] ) , is @xmath67 which has a solution @xmath68 for @xmath69 we have @xmath70 , while for @xmath71 we have @xmath72 .",
    "to define the value of the maximal acceleration , we will need a formula for the doppler shift for a accelerated observer or source . since doppler shift formulas may be derived from the lorentz transformations , similar formulas for the doppler shift will hold for comoving accelerated systems by replacing @xmath2 with @xmath3 .    for this paper",
    ", we need only the longitudinal shift for radiations in the direction of the radiation .",
    "assume that our source is radiating with frequency @xmath73 and both of direction od acceleration @xmath17 and the direction of radiation @xmath74 are in the @xmath13-direction . in the proper velocity - time representation ,",
    "the radiation is described by @xmath20 . using ( [ coordtranspfinal2 ] ) , we get @xmath75@xmath76 from this ,",
    "one gets the doppler shift for an accelerated observer to be @xmath77 if @xmath78 , we get @xmath79",
    "kndig s experiment ( kndig ( 1963 ) ) measured the transverse doppler effect in a rotating disk by means of the mssbauer effect .    in this experiment ,",
    "the distance from the center of the disk to the absorber was @xmath80 , and the rotation velocity varied between @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "the velocity @xmath83 of the absorber is perpendicular to the radius , the radiation direction .",
    "kndig expected to measure the transverse doppler effect by measuring the relative energy shift , which , by relativity , should be @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the photon energy as judged from its frequency .",
    "let us introduce a constant @xmath86 such that @xmath87 kndig s analysis of experimental result led @xmath88 which was claimed to be in full agreement with the expected time dilation .",
    "however , kholmetskii _ et al _ ( 2008 ) found an error in the data processing of the results of kndig s experiment .",
    "they corrected the error and recalculated the results for three different rotation velocities for which the authors of the experiment provided all the necessary data .",
    "after their corrections , the average value of @xmath86 is @xmath89 which does _ not _ agree with ( [ doplershift ] ) .",
    "the individual values of @xmath86 for each of the three velocities are given in table 1 .    .",
    "the values of @xmath86 from 3 experiments of kndig recalculated by kholmetskii _",
    "et al_. [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now use the above results and show that the clock hypothesis is not valid .",
    "this , in turn , leads us to predict a maximal acceleration.the clock hypothesis has been tested and was found to be valid to great accuracy .",
    "see , for example , the experiment of bailey j. _ et al _ ( 1977 ) for measurements of the time dilation for muons .",
    "this implies that if there is a maximal acceleration , it must be larger than the acceleration in that experiment .    the absorber is rotating .",
    "hence , its velocity is perpendicular to the radius , and its acceleration is toward the source of radiation .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the inertial frame of the lab .",
    "we can attach an accelerated system @xmath90 to the absorber .",
    "introduce an inertial frame @xmath9 co - moving with the absorber .",
    "the frame @xmath9 moves parallel to @xmath10 with constant velocity @xmath91 .",
    "the time dilation between @xmath10 and @xmath9 is given by the transverse doppler effect , as in ( [ doplershift ] ) .",
    "if the clock hypothesis , claiming that there is no effect on the rate of the clock due to acceleration , is valid , then there is no change in time from system @xmath9 to @xmath90 . as a result ,",
    "formula ( [ doplershift ] ) should also hold for time dilation between @xmath10 and @xmath90 .",
    "however , by ( [ kholres ] ) , this is not the case , with a deviation exceeding almost 20 times the measuring error .    in kndig",
    "s experiment , the system @xmath90 moves with acceleration @xmath92 toward the source .",
    "thus , time transformations between the inertial system @xmath9 and the accelerated co - moving system @xmath90 will be given by a longitudinal doppler shift given by ( [ doppleraprox ] ) .",
    "thus , time transformations between system @xmath10 and @xmath90 are the product of the transverse doppler transformation between @xmath10 and @xmath9 and the longitudinal doppler effect due to the acceleration of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath90 .",
    "we have @xmath93@xmath94 this implies that @xmath95 notice that the calculated value of @xmath86 is independent of the speed of rotation .",
    "this agrees approximately with the data in table 1 .    by substituting the observed time dilation in kndig s experiment from ( [ kholres ] ) and @xmath96",
    ", we get @xmath97 implying that @xmath98    in friedman ( 2009 ) is proposed an experiment test the clock hypothesis and to measure the maximal acceleration",
    "we have seen that the value of the maximal acceleration is very large .",
    "this explains why it was not detected in other experiments which did verify time dilation .",
    "kndig s experiment was designed to measure a transversal doppler effect of order @xmath99 due to the velocity of the absorber . on the other hand ,",
    "the acceleration was in the direction of the radiation , causing a longtitudal doppler shift of order @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we were able to observe the influence of the acceleration even though the maximal acceleration has a value of order @xmath100 .",
    "the maximal accelerations calculated for each of the three experiments of kndig are close to the value of the maximal acceleration predicted by the average value .",
    "the existence of a maximal acceleration was conjectured by caianiello ( 1981 ) , based on time - energy uncertainty in quantum mechanics .",
    "it has also been conjectured by schuller ( 2002 ) , using born - infeld theory .",
    "schuller ( 2002 ) obtained transformation formulas between accelerated systems similar to ours .",
    "but his maximal acceleration is a proper maximal accelerations @xmath101 , which is larger them our acceleration , and differs from particle to particle .",
    "based on an experiment of bailey j. _ et al _ ( 1977 ) , schuller estimates his maximal acceleration to be larger then @xmath102 , but for our maximal acceleration this experiment give an estimate @xmath103 .",
    "since this estimate is close to the maximal acceleration , improved muon lifetime experiments could provide another way to determine the maximal acceleration . for a long time ,",
    "b. mashhoon argued against the clock hypothesis and developed nonlocal transformations for accelerated observers ( see the review article mashhoon ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "our approach treats the problem differently .",
    "note that the existence of a maximal acceleration will necessitate the modification of the lorentz transformations and maxwell s equations , which allow unlimited acceleration .",
    "the major modification will come on the quantum scale .",
    "note that at quantum system distances , the classical electromagnetic force would generate accelerations above the maximal one .",
    "for example , the classical electric field of a proton would generate a maximal acceleration on an electron positioned at a distance of about @xmath104 from it . at quantum distances , therefore , the potential of the electron will differ significantly from the classical one , and , by assuming continuity at the origin , it follows that this potential has a potential well .",
    "this may provide another model for the hydrogen atom .",
    "for an additional example , take the classical electric field of a proton , which would generate a maximal acceleration on another proton positioned at a distance of about @xmath105 from it . by assuming continuity at the origin",
    ", we obtain a potential barrier for the proton similar to the strong force at small distances .    in light of these observations ,",
    "we propose the following problem :    * problem * _ is quantum mechanics equipped to handle the maximal acceleration ? on the other hand , can the extended relativity , preserving the limitation of the maximal acceleration , also incorporate quantum phenomena ? _    as shown by caianiello ( 1981 ) and others , one of the main features of quantum mechanics , the uncertainty , is connected with existence of a maximal acceleration .",
    "the lorentz transformations may be modified implementing methods of bounded symmetric domains , see friedman ( 2004 ) and friedman and semon ( 2005 ) , for the symmetric domain of relativistically admissible velocities and accelerations .",
    "this may be done by use of the relativistic phase space introduced in friedman ( 2008 ) .",
    "kndig s experiment was not designed to test our observation , and in the recalculation by kholmetskii _",
    "et al _ , the measuring error is underestimated , because the data processing method applied is not direct . thus , our finding is only an indication of the existence of a maximal acceleration and an estimate of its value .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown that an experiment determining the value of maximal acceleration could be done with currently available technology .",
