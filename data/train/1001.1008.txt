    "recent studies using hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) observations have discovered tens of candidate galaxies at redshifts @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the new wfc3 observations have broadened our knowledge of the highest redshift galaxies yet found , complementing @xmath0 galaxy searches with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer @xcite , ground - based dropout selections @xcite , and narrow band lyman-@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) emission surveys @xcite .",
    "the existence of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 has been well - established by these studies , and the importance of these high - redshift galaxies for reionization and subsequent galaxy formation at lower redshifts will likely motivate the dedication of large telescope allocations to detailing their abundance .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a method to rapidly compare possible photometric survey strategies for detecting large numbers of @xmath1 galaxies , and forecast constraints on the @xmath1 galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) achieved by different hst survey designs .",
    "a determination of the constraining power a survey can obtain requires an estimate of the uncertainty in the abundance of galaxies as a function of luminosity .",
    "in addition to the poisson uncertainty inherent in galaxy counts , cosmic sample variance induced by density fluctuations and galaxy clustering must be accounted for ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a particularly powerful approach for estimating these uncertainties and determining the resulting potential constraints on the luminosity function of galaxies in the udf was presented by @xcite .",
    "these authors used cosmological simulations to determine the abundance and spatial distribution of dark matter halos and then applied a model for the halo mass - to - light ratio to determine the abundance of galaxies of a given luminosity .",
    "poisson and sample variance uncertainties were estimated by drawing pencil beam realizations of the survey from the cosmological volume ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a maximum - likelihood approach was then used to study constraints on the luminosity function for various dropout selections .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimation of lf parameters based on mock catalogues can account for detailed selection effects and spatial correlations in addition to the poisson and sample variance uncertainties .",
    "such simulations have clear advantages for estimating the completeness of magnitude- limited surveys or understanding systematic effects introduced by dropout color selections .",
    "however , the need for halo catalogues from cosmological simulations introduces two limitations .",
    "first , the volume of the simulation should probe many independent realizations of the modeled survey .",
    "however , future high - redshift galaxy surveys with wfc3 or other instruments may take the form of deeper versions of surveys like the spitzer extended deep survey ( seds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exploration science program or the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these surveys are each @xmath9 or larger , and large volume ( @xmath10 ) cosmological simulations are required to probe multiple independent samples of the surveys high - redshift galaxy populations .",
    "for instance , a @xmath9 survey at @xmath11 has a comoving volume of @xmath12 .",
    "the largest simulation used by @xcite would provide less than two independent samples of such a volume , and even the millennium simulation @xcite with a comoving box size @xmath13 would only provide @xmath14 independent samples of such a wide high - redshift survey .",
    "second , the method requires access to and manipulation of cosmological simulation results .",
    "this requirement may pose an unwanted computational overhead for those interested in rapid estimates and comparisons of potential constraints from a wide range of survey designs .",
    "a simpler methodology for estimating survey constraints on the abundance of high - redshift galaxies that does not directly require halo catalogues from cosmological simulations is therefore desirable for performing rapid comparisons of survey designs .",
    "hence , we seek an approximate method for forecasting lf parameter constraints that relies on descriptions of galaxy and dark matter halo abundance and clustering , poisson and cosmic sample variance , and parameter covariances that are analytical or easily calculable through numerical methods . we utilize a simple model for describing the clustering of @xmath1 galaxies based on fiducial empirical estimates of the high - redshift galaxy luminosity function @xcite and abundance matching between galaxies and dark matter halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we then adopt a common approach to translate galaxy clustering and matter fluctuations into an estimate of the cosmic sample variance ( see the various calculations in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "with this estimate of the sample variance and poisson uncertainty from an assumed fiducial model for the abundance of galaxies , we use a fisher matrix formalism to characterize the likelihood function and estimate @xmath1 luminosity function parameter constraints .",
    "the presented methodology is fast and flexible , and can be used with appropriate extensions , to estimate constraints on galaxy abundance for other survey sample selections and redshifts .",
    "motivated by the exciting recent hst wfc3 results , we focus on modeling @xmath1 dropout survey designs . while we choose to study broadband searches for high - redshift galaxies , narrow band surveys for high - redshift @xmath8 emission present another interesting class of survey designs .",
    "the rapid progress in detecting increasing numbers of high - redshift @xmath8 emitters using narrow band surveys has motivated theoretical efforts both to understand and predict the abundance of @xmath8 emitters .",
    "the observable properties of the high - redshift @xmath8 emitter population are particularly difficult to model owing to the uncertain escape fraction , intergalactic medium absorption and other radiative transfer effects , as well as uncertainties in our knowledge of the galaxy formation process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while we have found that the combination of existing deep / narrow surveys with a future wide / shallow survey or a future ultradeep / narrow survey would provide tight constraints on the @xmath1 luminosity function , studies of the galaxy population at higher and lower redshifts could require substantially different surveys .",
    "for instance , the @xmath359 dropout candidates identified in the udf  go  data are all fainter than @xmath360 @xcite .",
    "the decreasing abundance of relatively bright galaxies with increasing redshift will tend to favor deeper and narrow surveys .",
    "our calculations can easily be extended to estimate the constraining power of various surveys designs for higher - redshift galaxy populations , but we will save such estimates for future work when better fiducial estimates of the @xmath359 luminosity function are available .    our fisher matrix approach requires the use of a fiducial model for the abundance of @xmath1 .",
    "we adopt the @xcite estimate of the galaxy luminosity function , which was determined by scaling the characteristic magnitude @xmath92 and normalization @xmath90 from lower redshift data and then fitting for the faint - end slope @xmath7 .",
    "if the @xmath1 galaxy luminosity function differs substantially from the @xcite estimate , then our forecasted constraints could be similarly inaccurate .",
    "for instance , if the normalization @xmath90 was considerably lower or the characteristic magnitude @xmath92 much fainter than that estimate by @xcite , then the relative benefit of combining the udf  go  and goods  ers  data with a wide / shallow survey over a narrow / ultradeep design could be reduced .",
    "the calculations in  [ subsubsection : multiple_fields ] and  [ section : results ] suggest that splitting wide surveys into multiple fields to probe statistically - independent regions of the universe may not dramatically improve constraints on the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "while this conclusion depends strongly on the total volume of the survey , other considerations such as scheduling , field observability , or sky backgrounds could make multiple fields advantageous compared with a single contiguous field of the same total area .",
    "the abundance matching calculation also requires either knowledge or assumption about the completeness of the survey and the fraction of dark matter halos occupied by galaxies . we have assumed that the surveys are essentially volume - limited and that there is a one - to - one correspondence between galaxies and dark matter halos .",
    "both of these assumptions are likely imperfect , and some estimates of the high - redshift occupation fraction are as low as @xmath329 @xcite .",
    "the influence of these assumptions over the forecasted parameter constraints depends on the character of the survey . for a given observed luminosity function , reducing the halo occupation fraction or the survey completeness acts to reduce the effective galaxy bias in the survey by either increasing the number of halos per galaxy in the survey or increasing the number of undetected galaxies . in either case",
    ", the poisson uncertainty is based on the observed number of galaxies and is unaffected . for purposes of constraining the observed luminosity function ,",
    "wide surveys are fairly insensitive to either assumption , since poisson uncertainty in the abundance of bright galaxies plays a large role in their error budget .",

    "however , the relative effect is small and the degradation is only @xmath361 for simultaneously low incompleteness ( @xmath362 ) and small occupation fraction ( @xmath363 ) .",
    "motivated by the exciting initial galaxy survey data obtained by newly - installed wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , we have attempted to quantify how well on - going and possible future infrared surveys with wfc3 will constrain the abundance of galaxies at @xmath1 . our primary methods and results",

    "the combined constraints from multiple surveys can be estimated easily by summing their fisher matrices .",

    "the six model surveys considered cover a large range of areas ( @xmath369 square arcmin ) and depths ( @xmath370 in @xmath194 ) to study the relative value area and depth for constraining the abundance of @xmath1 galaxies . when combined with the forthcoming udf  go  and goods  ers  data , all the surveys considered produce interesting luminosity function constraints ( see table [ table : model_survey_constraints ] ) .",

    "this survey would require 780 total orbits , including equal coverage in a bluer wfc3 filter to define a drop out color selection .",
    "in contrast , the abundance of _ faint _ galaxies would be best constrained by increasing depth of the hst ultradeep fields to @xmath255 orbits per pointing ( @xmath256 in f140w ) , which provides marginalized lf constraints of @xmath302 , @xmath301 , and @xmath374 for 750 total orbits ( including equal coverage in a bluer wfc3 filter ) .",
