    "if the sgr were surrounded by an extensive dust cloud , a substantial amount of the giant flare radiation will be converted into ir radiation . given the extended nature of the dust cloud , light travel times across it must be considered .",
    "the two mips 24@xmath56 m images were obtained at @xmath57yr and @xmath58yr after the 1998 august 27 giant flare from sgr@xmath31900 + 14 .",
    "if the ring is from a light echo due to reprocessing of the giant flare photons then the time delay @xmath59 is related to the location of the ( assumed rapid ) reprocessing by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 are polar coordinates with the sgr located at the origin and with the @xmath62-axis pointing to the observer .",
    "this locus of points from which reprocessed photons reach the observer simultaneously describes a paraboloidal surface centered on the location of the sgr and symmetric about our line of sight to the sgr , which grows linearly in time , in the sense that @xmath63 is a function of the polar angle @xmath64 alone .",
    "the lateral distance from the sgr to this surface ( at @xmath65 ) is simply @xmath66 , which corresponds to @xmath67pc and @xmath68pc for our two epochs of observation , where @xmath69 corresponds to the semi - major axis of the ring for @xmath70kpc .",
    "the main characteristics of such a light echo can be demonstrated by the simple and idealized case of a thin spherical shell of dust of radius @xmath38 centered on the sgr .",
    "its intersection with the paraboloidal surface described above is simply at @xmath71 so that the apparent ring size @xmath72 is @xmath73 it initially grows super - luminally , its expansion slowing down until it reaches a maximal size of @xmath74 at @xmath75 , and then begins to shrink increasingly fast until it disappears at @xmath76 .",
    "its apparent velocity @xmath77 in units of @xmath78 is @xmath79 while @xmath80 for much of the time , we also have @xmath81 at @xmath82 , i.e. very close to the time when the ring reaches its maximal size and begins to shrink",
    ". however , for two generic observation times one expects a fractional change of @xmath83 in the ring size , which in our case corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , since the observed ring in our case is elongated with an axis ratio of @xmath84 , the shell of reprocessing dust must clearly be non - spherical , and therefore the maximal size would also depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath85 , so that the apparent expansion velocity of the ring would never vanish everywhere at once , and one can expect fractional changes of the order of @xmath86 in the ring shape or brightness between the two epochs , at least in some parts of the ring . therefore , our strict limits on its exact location , and fractional chances in its size , shape , and brightness ( of @xmath87 ) are very hard to satisfy simultaneously in this scenario .",
    "the temperature of the dust can be used to determine the required luminosity of the heating source by means of radiation balance .",
    "if @xmath88 is the dust absorption efficiency , then its temperature is given by a balance between the heat input due to the flux it absorbs and emits . if the flux it absorbs is dominated by a point source ( which is also a useful approximation for a group of sources at distances larger than their separations ) with luminosity @xmath89 peaking at @xmath90 , at a distance @xmath38 , then a ( spherical , for simplicity ) dust grain of radius @xmath91 absorbs energy at a rate of @xmath92 and radiates away energy at a rate of @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "equating the two rates gives : @xmath95 if the luminosity @xmath34 is dominated by a source of temperature @xmath35 ( @xmath96 ) , and both @xmath97 and @xmath98 are in the range where @xmath99 , then @xmath100 and @xmath101    this basically sets a limit for the required heating source .",
    "note that for a given source equation ( [ lum ] ) implies that the dust temperature decreases rather slowly with the distance from the source , @xmath102 and could help explain why we do not detect a change along the ring in the apparent temperature of the ring emission .",
    "the @xmath84 axis ratio of the ring suggests that if it was indeed formed by the initial spike of a giant flare , then the flare had an angular variation in its isotropic equivalent luminosity @xmath103 or energy @xmath104 of a factor of @xmath105 ( since the sublimation radius scales as @xmath106 while the dust shattering radius scales as @xmath107 , and the true axis ratio of the dust - free cavity could be somewhat larger than the observed axis ratio of the ring due to projection effects ) .",
    "moreover , the relatively modest degree of anisotropy suggests that the true total energy output in the event that created the dust - free cavity was @xmath108erg , which is comparable to the _ isotropic equivalent _ energy output for the 2004 giant flare from sgr@xmath31806 - 20 . for the latter event it is hard to estimate the true energy output , since we have no observations that directly constrain the emission in directions other than our line of sight"

    "<S> , we find no discernable change in the size ( positional shifts @xmath26  ) or flux ( root mean square @xmath27% ) of the ring emission in the 1.6 yr between the two observations . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary nature of the ring strongly disfavours one obvious explanation for the creation of the ring  a light echo , due to reprocessing by the surrounding dust , from the 1998 sgr@xmath31900@xmath414 giant flare . </S>",
    "<S> this model predicts a typical fractional change in the ring size and brightness between the two epoch observations of @xmath28 , which is not seen in the data ( see supplementary information for more details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> morphologically , the ring resembles the wind - blown bubbles and shells observed around evolved massive stars@xcite , such as b supergiants , luminous blue variables and wolf - rayet stars . </S>",
    "<S> the supersonic wind from the star drives a shock into the surrounding medium , sweeping up the ambient material into a thin , dense , cool shell . </S>",
    "<S> the emission from the swept - up material is powered by the luminous central star . </S>",
    "<S> such shells have typical radii of @xmath29pc for wolf - rayet stars@xcite and @xmath30pc for luminous blue variables / supergiants@xcite , overlapping the size of our ring . </S>",
    "<S> to guard against a simple chance superposition with an unrelated source , we investigated the photometric properties of stars near the centre of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> the sources in the immediate vicinity of the sgr position@xcite are too faint in comparison with the near - infrared luminosities expected for the massive stars discussed above@xcite , and thus can not be physically associated with the ring . for stars with larger offsets from the centre ( @xmath31  ) we can not rule out a massive star classification based solely on available archival data . </S>",
    "<S> however , a situation in which an off - centre star creates an elliptical ring with an unrelated magnetar at its exact centre appears rather contrived .    in the absence of an obvious chance superposition </S>",
    "<S> , the close positional coincidence between the sgr and the centre of the ring then strongly indicates that the sgr and the ring are physically connected . </S>",
    "<S> one interpretation is that the ring represents material ejected during the late stages of the sgr progenitor s evolution . </S>",
    "<S> however , we know that a supernova explosion occurred , producing the magnetar , and the resulting shock wave is expected to disrupt such a close shell as it interacts with and dissipates into the surrounding material . </S>",
    "<S> some cases are known in which the snr has over - run a wind - swept shell , but the wind bubble invariably emerges irregular and fragmented in shape after its encounter with the supernova@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetric and well - defined appearance of our ring thus would imply that the supernova shock wave is still inside the ring . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that this would require the supernova to be @xmath32 yr old , with bright radio and x - ray emission , contrary to observations . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of high - energy x - ray and non - thermal radio emission also excludes the possibility that the observed ring is produced by the emission of the blast wave from the progenitor s supernova explosion .    </S>",
    "<S> the rejection of these various possibilities raises the issue of the energy source that is powering the ring . </S>",
    "<S> we derived a limit for the required luminosity of the heating source by means of radiation balance , using the measured temperature @xmath33 of the dust . </S>",
    "<S> if the luminosity @xmath34 is dominated by a source of temperature @xmath35 , then ( see supplementary information for details ) @xmath36 where @xmath33 is measured in units of 100 k , @xmath35 is measured in units of @xmath37 k and @xmath38 , the distance from the central heating source , is measured in units of parsecs .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the persistent x - ray luminosity of the sgr is only @xmath39 and , thus , can not generate the observed infrared emission from the ring . the only viable heat source consistent with the observed properties of the ring appears to be irradiation from the stars in the nearby cluster . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1a clearly shows that both the cluster and sgr@xmath31900@xmath414 are embedded in a diffuse , extended cloud of 24@xmath7 m emission . </S>",
    "<S> similar diffuse 24@xmath7 m emission is also observed in association with the clusters containing sgr@xmath31806@xmath520 ( ref.24 ) and westerlund 1 , implying that the extended emission is powered by the cluster stars . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , given the location and size of the 24@xmath7 m nebula , the cluster might be more spatially extended than previously thought , with as - yet - undiscovered member stars .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible mechanism for the creation of the ring is the formation of a dust - free cavity owing to the giant flare activity from sgr@xmath31900 + 14 , which would naturally explain why the ring is centred on the magnetar . </S>",
    "<S> the destruction of dust grains can occur either by sublimation due to the heating by ultraviolet@xcite or x - ray@xcite emission , or by grain charging due to the incident x - rays , which causes the dust grains to gradually shatter into smaller pieces until they are eventually destroyed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the size and shape of the ring can constrain the energy output and degree of anisotropy of the flaring event ( see supplementary information for details ) . using equation ( 25 ) of ref.26 with the fiducial values and @xmath40 ( where the flux at frequency @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath41 ) , we find that the dust destruction radius matches well with the observed dimensions of the ring around sgr@xmath31900@xmath414 for @xmath42erg . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is close to the observed isotropic equivalent energy@xcite in the initial spike of the 27 august 1998 flare ; the latter , however , is only accurate for photon energies @xmath43kev , whereas the estimated dust - destruction radius requires photons with energies of @xmath44 kev .    alternatively , a previous </S>",
    "<S> , more energetic giant flare from sgr@xmath31900@xmath414 , for example , similar to the 2004 december 27 giant flare from sgr@xmath31806 - 20 ( refs 27 , 28 ) , with @xmath45erg , could have carved the dust - free cavity during the magnetar s estimated spin - down age of @xmath46yr . for a rate of one flare per </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 yr ( ref.28 ) , it is reasonable to expect at least one such event @xmath48yr ago , with @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> then , for the current location of the sgr still to be at the centre of the ring to a precision of 1  , the proper motion of the magnetar ( due to its birth kick velocity @xmath50 ) and the proper motion of the dust - free cavity ( with velocity @xmath51 ) should satisfy @xmath52 .    in light of the probable association between the sgr and the star cluster , </S>",
    "<S> we have re - examined the issue of the mismatch in extinction , which has been used as an argument against that connection@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as our observations show , the cluster - sgr environment is characterized by a complex dust distribution on small spatial scales and dust destruction by the high - energy emission of the sgr . because the derived extinction values were based on measurements towards two distinct physical locations ( the supergiants and the sgr ) and are based on different tracers ( gas and dust ) it is then not surprising that the resulting values differ . </S>",
    "<S> similar differences have been observed for the cas a snr@xcite and extragalactic gamma ray burst sources@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we note that the visual absorption derived solely from the near - infrared photometry of the m supergiants , using both the published data@xcite and new measurements extracted from the two micorn all sky survey , is a@xmath53 mag , in comparison with a@xmath54 mag , the value obtained when the optical i band measurement is included . </S>",
    "<S> although this is puzzling and deserves further investigation , the various extinction measurements are clearly subject to large uncertainties and can potentially be reconciled with our conclusion that the sgr is a member of the star cluster </S>",
