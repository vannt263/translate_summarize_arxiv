    "in any of the above seed formation models , subsequent bh growth needs to be still rapid @xcite . when the bh is fed by sufficiently strong gas flows , and the emergent luminosity increases , radiative feedback is likely to affect gas dynamics .",
    "radiation force is crucially important at the vicinity of the bh horizon because the gas is highly opaque to electron scattering . in particular ,",
    "if the luminosity approaches the eddington luminosity , @xmath14 , the radiation force becomes comparable to the gravity of the accreting bh and thus the accretion rate would be limited to the eddington rate @xmath3 .",

    ", width=302 ]      in order to understand the physics which allows hyper - eddington accretion , we consider a toy model of a geometrically thin , but optically thick spherical shell around a point source , driven by radiation force into a rapidly collapsing medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the luminosity @xmath99 of the central source is assumed constant , and the equation of motion of the shell is given by @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the mass of the shell , @xmath215 is the distance of the shell from the center , and @xmath97 and @xmath49 are the accretion rate and velocity of the gas inflow just outside the shell .",
    "the terms on the right hand side correspond to the outward force exerted on the shell by radiation force , and the inward forces due to ram pressure of the rapid inflow and the bh s gravity .",
    "we here assume that ( i ) the shell is optically thick to the uv ( ionizing ) radiation and absorbs all incident radiation with momentum of @xmath216 , and that ( ii ) the entire cloud is effectively optically thin to the recombination radiation .",
    "if the recombination radiation is efficiently scattered by the neutral shell , that is , if condition ( ii ) is invalid , then the radiation is trapped within the shell ( i.e. the neutral shells just outside the hii  region ) .",
    "multiple scattering events in this regime would increase the total radiation pressure force to @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is an effective optical depth to scattering . in our case ,",
    "hi rayleigh scattering is negligible , but ly@xmath219 scattering would be important because of the high optical depth at the line center , @xmath220 .",
    "however , before radiation pressure by ly@xmath219 affects motion of the shell , the ly@xmath219 photons would be converted to @xmath221 continuum photons and @xmath222 ev photons ( h@xmath63 free - bound transition ) , to which the shell is optically thin .",
    "we therefore expect our condition ( ii ) to hold , with an effective scattering opacity @xmath218 at most a factor of a few .",
    "however , future work is needed to investigate the effect of the trapping of ly@xmath219 radiation , its conversion to lower - energy continuum photons , and the escape of these photons from the clouds .",
    "the growth rate of the shell is given by @xmath223 and the initial shell mass is given by @xmath224 where the subscript 0 means the initial value .",
    "for simplicity , we consider two extreme cases for the density profile : a constant density profile @xmath225 and the bondi profile @xmath226 , with corresponding initial masses of @xmath227 we here set @xmath228 , the free - fall velocity @xmath194 , @xmath229 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .    .",

    "solid ( dashed ) curves correspond to constant ( bondi ) initial density profiles . as this figure shows , when both ram pressure and gravity are included , the shell radius contracts . on the other hand ,",
    "when either of the inward forces are turned off the shell continues to expand , and never accretes onto the center . note that the expansion velocity of the shell is slower for the cases with heavier masses ( dashed ) , but the choice of the initial shell mass is not important .",
    "overall , we infer that it is the combination of the ram pressure and gravity that overwhelms radiation force and yields hyper - eddington accretion .",

    "we find that a transition to hyper - eddington accretion phase occurs when @xmath246 ( see also equation [ eq : condition ] ) .",

    "however , we identify a new condition , which determines whether the hyper - eddington accretion is steady , or strongly episodic .",
    "we find that a steady state is maintained as long as the radiation luminosity from the central source is below a critical value , @xmath248 this corresponds to the requirement that the ram pressure of the collapsing medium and the bh gravity on the accumulated mass of the shell at the edge of the hii  region dominate over the radiation force , i.e. @xmath249 ( see equation [ eq : ram ] ) .",
    "if the luminosity exceeds this critical value , then a steady hyper - eddington phase can not exist , and the accretion instead becomes episodic .",

    ", we also offered a physical understanding of our simulation results : we showed that the latter can be recovered in a toy model of an optically thick spherical shell , driven by radiation into a collapsing cloud .    throughout this paper , we have assumed a single power - law radiation spectrum with an index of @xmath251 over a frequency range of @xmath252 ( see equation [ eq : power ] ) . in this case , all of the radiation can contribute to ionization of neutral gas .",
    "however , a realistic spectrum of an accretion disk around a bh would allows lower energy photons with @xmath253 which can escape without ionizing the accreting gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , assuming a realistic spectrum , but with a fixed total luminosity , the transition to hyper - eddington accretion is more likely to occur , compared to our case .    in our simulations , the photosphere and trapping radius , located at small radii ,",
    "are not resolved directly .",
    "when the accreting gas has a finite angular momentum , a compact accretion disk should form around the central bh . then",
    ", anisotropic radiation and/or outflows / jets from the center would break the spherical symmetry of the inflow , at least in the inner regions .",
    "a fully self - consistent treatment of such an accretion flow , which has an anisotropic , bright source with @xmath189 at the central region , embedded in a quasi - spherical inflow at large radii , will require multi - dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations .",
