    "the infrared suppression of the gluon 2-point function in qcd @xcite entails that the bare @xmath1 vertex , usually employed in the rainbow truncation of the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) , is insufficient to trigger dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore we expect an infrared enhancement in the quark and gluon vertex , as suggested also by its slavnov - taylor identity ( sti ) .",
    "a model vertex with a ball - chiu or curtis - pennington structure multiplied by enhancing ghost factors has been successfully employed in @xcite in the quark dse . for a short summary of these results",
    "@xcite .        in this work",
    "we report a diagrammatic construction based on the one - loop perturbative qcd corrections to the bare vertex @xcite .",
    "there are two relevant diagrams , to which we refer as abelian and non - abelian due to the vertex attached to the gluon ( as is customary ) . in both diagrams we substitute the quark and gluon propagators by their dressed counterparts solving the dse s @xcite .",
    "these are added to the bare vertex @xmath2 and the renormalization constant is fixed by imposing that the @xmath3 component is unity at a renormalization point of @xmath4 .",
    "the non - abelian diagram , depicted in figure [ nacorrection ] dominates over the abelian one nominally by a factor @xmath5 .",
    "we have checked that 1 ) this dominance by an order of magnitude remains after loop integration in the vertex for various kinematics and 2 ) the impact of the abelian vertex on the quark dse is smaller by the same factor by performing a kinematic average with the kernel of the dse as weighting function .",
    "therefore to a precision of @xmath6 or even better one can ignore the abelian diagram .",
    "the vertex is projected into the tensor basis from appendix a in @xcite .",
    "the loop integral is calculated numerically in four dimensions with a standard gauss - legendre grid . in one computer code",
    "we perform the spin sums numerically , in an alternative calculation we employ a form code to reduce the kernel analytically to relatively complex but tractable scalar integrals .    if the internal @xmath1 vertices are taken as bare @xmath2 then the construction , that qualitatively has the right behaviour , is not strong enough to reproduce lattice data and trigger chiral symmetry breaking in the quark dse .",
    "this , as commented above , is expected and can be remedied by enhancing the internal vertices by a ghost dressing factor . in figure [ latt ]",
    "we compare the resulting @xmath1 vertex with lattice data at the so called `` asymmetric point '' characterized by @xmath7 where the gluon momentum vanishes , @xmath8 flows into the vertex and @xmath9 exits .",
    "this comparison is successful for the leading dirac amplitude @xmath10 and the scalar amplitude , @xmath11 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath12 vanishes in our model at low momenta , whereas the lattice data ( with large errors ) seem to approach a constant value implying a divergence of @xmath13 .",
    "we now investigate a more interesting section of kinematic space , that we denote `` totally asymmetric '' point , characterized by the relations @xmath14 and @xmath15 between the moduli of the momenta .",
    "this point is interesting because the tensor basis used is non - singular and all twelve different dirac amplitudes @xmath16 contribute to the vertex .",
    "we plot the four leading structures in figure [ asym ] .",
    "the other eight dirac amplitudes are increasingly smaller , down to two orders of magnitude below the plotted ones .",
    "thus there is a rich hyrarchy of dirac amplitudes that can help in model building .",
    "once we are in possession of a construction that successfully compares to lattice data , we employ it to perform a study of the mass dependence of the vertex .",
    "first note the abelian one - loop diagram contains two quark propagators , and is therefore suppressed as @xmath17 in the heavy quark limit , whereas the non - abelian diagram will damp as @xmath18 .",
    "therefore future calculations relating observables in the charmonium and bottomonium systems ( see @xcite for discussion ) will be sensitive to what class of diagrams enters the vertex model .",
    "an interesting observation is that for the range of quark masses considered in the lattice calculations , the @xmath11 dirac amplitude has a maximum .",
    "if the current quark mass is further increased , the intermediate quark propagator suppresses the vertex loop .",
    "conversely , approaching the chiral limit , the quark mass function takes its minimum value dictated by chiral symmetry breaking alone and the scalar part of the loop construction also has a minimum ( slight corrections to this result are expected after self - consistently solving a vertex equation ) .    as for the leading @xmath10 amplitude , we plot in figure [ massdep ] the quotient @xmath19 , where deviations from unity signal departures from the abelian ward - takahashi identity",
    "results similar to ours have been independently obtained @xcite in a different scheme .",
    "this exploits the sti for the three - gluon vertex to model it .",
    "since this amounts to the resummation of a totally different class of diagrams we would need better lattice data to distinguish both models .",
    "our construction is of course valid ( within approximations ) for all possible kinematics and not just when the gluon momentum vanishes . on the positive side ,",
    "both works concur in predicting @xmath20 to vanish as @xmath21 .",
    "we should note that the existing lattice data , with large error bands , suggests instead this limit is finite , implying a divergence in the vertex , in the dirac amplitude @xmath13 .    when multiplied by appropriate powers of @xmath22 the resulting dimensionless dirac amplitudes of our vertex construction vanish as @xmath21 except the leading structure @xmath10 that takes a finite value .    whether a divergence can arise as a consequence of the feedback of the obtained vertex model on the loop construction itself ( implying a self - consistent solution is needed ) or as a consequence of the backreaction on the quark sde is a topic under current scrutiny .",
    "the construction of a quark scattering kernel based in our model vertex and consistent with chiral symmetry is now straight - forward .",
    "* _ how are euclidean space singularities in the two - point functions mapped to minkowski space after analytical continuation ? _ + this is a nonperturbative problem and we lack a full answer at this stage .",
    "one has obtained some understanding of the analytical structure of the two - point functions in a recent work @xcite .",
    "also hamiltonian calculations in coulomb gauge , not in euclidean space , provide clear evidence for the picture of ghost enhancement and gluon suppression at low momentum @xcite . * _ the running @xmath23 you are employing seems to be somewhat too high in the middle - momentum range .",
    "what is the impact of this in the results reported ? _",
    "+ this study does not aim at precisely pinpointing details of the propagators and vertex functions , but to obtain insight into their qualitative features and structure , and identify possible divergences that may otherwise escape lattice calculations . in this respect , the impact of this few - percent deviation can be ignored . *",
    "_ why is the dressing of the three - gluon vertex omitted ? _ + as can be observed in figure [ dsevertex ] , all dressing of the triple gluon vertex can be absorbed in the quark - gluon scattering kernel .",
    "our model based on the one - loop correction to the qqg vertex can be also viewed as an approximation to this kernel . in this exact equation",
    "@xcite we are neglecting completely the two last terms , involving the ghost - quark scattering kernel and the three - gluon - quark scattering kernels , as their skeleton expansion starts at two loops .",
