    "observations of stars of various metallicities ( @xmath0=(fe / h)/(fe / h)@xmath5 ) have shown that the abundance ratios b / fe and be / fe @xcite do not vary appreciably over a broad range of @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this near constancy implies that the ratios of the b and be production rates to the fe production rate must remain essentially constant as a function of metallicity .",
    "moreover , as long as this constancy is maintained and destruction effects ( due to astration ) do not play a major role , the production and inventory ratios are equal . for @xmath0 less than about 0.1 , most of the fe is thought to be produced in type ii supernovae ( snii ) , with type i supernovae not yet contributing significantly @xcite .",
    "limiting our considerations to this range of metallicities , the constancy of b / fe and be / fe strongly suggest that b and be are also produced by sniis .",
    "the accepted paradigm for the origin of most of the be is production in spallation reactions of accelerated particles ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , cno ) deriving their energy from supernovae .",
    "b , in addition to such reactions , is also produced in neutrino interactions in sniis @xcite .",
    "the observed be abundance as a function of metallicity can be approximated by be / h@xmath85.2@xmath910@xmath10(fe / h)/(fe / h)@xmath5 @xcite , implying that be / fe@xmath81.7@xmath910@xmath11 .",
    "the relatively well known fe yield per snii ( @xmath120.1m@xmath5 based on sn87a observations ) then provides a direct determination of the accelerated particle - produced be per snii ( @xmath123.6@xmath910@xmath13atoms ) , independent of the details of the spallation reactions .",
    "the total energy per snii imparted to the accelerated particles to produce the required amount of be , as well as the accompanying production of the other light isotopes , do depend on the accelerated particle composition and spectrum , the ambient medium composition and the path length @xmath14 available to the accelerated particles for producing nuclear reactions .",
    "previous calculation of libeb production by accelerated particles @xcite incorporated various compositions and energy spectra but used different codes for spectra extending to relativistic energies ( hereafter hecr ) or spectra confined to low energies ( hereafter lecr ) .",
    "furthermore , the hecr calculations at epochs of low metallicity implicitly assumed that the composition of the hecr is the same as that of the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "in addition , secondary reaction chains ( e.g. fast @xmath15c on ambient h producing @xmath2b and the subsequent interaction of the fast @xmath2b to produce @xmath16b or lighter isotopes ) , which are quite important when hecr with solar or higher metallicity are interacting with a low metallicity ambient medium , have been ignored .",
    "we have developed a new code that employs updated cross sections @xcite and incorporates all the possible secondary chains for source particles up to @xmath17o .",
    "we calculate libeb production for a variety of accelerated particle spectra ( lecr to hecr ) , ambient medium metallicities 10@xmath18@xmath19@xmath0@xmath191 , and various accelerated particle compositions . by normalizing the libeb yields to the energy content of the source accelerated particles",
    ", we can directly determine the snii particle acceleration efficiency required to produce the observed be / fe .",
    "we next combine the accelerated particle - produced and @xmath4-produced @xmath2b and set constraints on the contribution of the @xmath4 process on b production .",
    "finally , we consider the implications of the @xmath3li observations at low metallicity @xcite .",
    "we assume that the ambient composition is solar scaled by a variable metallicity .",
    "for the fast particle composition we use the following : ( i ) ejecta of type ii supernovae ( 12 - 40 m@xmath5 progenitors ) for various metallicities @xcite averaged over an imf proportional to @xmath20 ( hereafter snii ) ; ( ii ) current epoch cosmic ray source abundances @xcite ( hereafter crs ) ; ( iii ) ambient medium abundances , i.e. solar system abundances scaled with metallicity ( hereafter ssz ) ; and ( iv ) the ejecta of a supernova from a 60 m@xmath5 progenitor @xcite ( hereafter sn60 ) .",
    "the snii abundances of the most relevant isotopes , @xmath21h , @xmath22he , @xmath15c and @xmath17o , are weakly dependent on @xmath0 and are approximately proportional to 100:20:0.2:1 , respectively .",
    "the crs and sn60 abundances are taken independent of @xmath0 and the above proportions are 175:25:0.8:1 and 0:0.7:0.5:1 , respectively .",
    "thus , crs is not too different from snii except that it is more abundant in @xmath15c ; for sn60 , h and he are absent or very under abundant , and , as for crs , @xmath15c is more abundant than for snii .",
    "we employ a shock acceleration spectrum with a high energy cutoff , @xmath23 , except for sn60 for which , as before @xcite , we assume that above 50 mev / nucl the spectrum decreases as @xmath24 ; @xmath6 and @xmath25 are momentum and kinetic energy , both per nucleon , and @xmath26 is particle velocity . the sn60 model , because of its relatively high c / o and sharp high energy cutoff , produces the highest b / be and @xmath2b/@xmath16b without violating energy constraints ( see below ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 is energy independent , and present results for @xmath14=10 g@xmath27 , a leaky box model , and @xmath28 , a closed galaxy model .",
    "the neglect of the energy dependence affects our results only marginally .",
    "the incorporation of the secondary reaction chains can lead to contributions as high as 60% of the total production in some cases .",
    "the nuclear reactions are accompanied by energy loss due to coulomb interactions of the accelerated particles with the ambient medium ( assumed to be neutral ) .",
    "1 shows the be production per deposited energy .",
    "the solid curves are for snii , the dashed line is for ssz and the dashed line with diamonds is for sn60 .",
    "the values for crs are practically identical to those for snii with @xmath29=10gev / n .",
    "all curves with given values of @xmath29 are for the exponential cutoff at the indicated @xmath29 .",
    "we see that for snii and sn60 , for which the metallicities of the accelerated particles are nearly independent of @xmath0 , @xmath30 is practically independent of the ambient medium metallicity ; this , however , is not the case for ssz for which the metallicity of the fast particles increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath30 decreases rapidly for @xmath31mev / n ; we show values as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath29=10mev / n . using the values plotted in fig .",
    "1 we can express the be yield per snii as @xmath32 $ ] , where 10@xmath33 erg is the energy content in accelerated particles per snii . as the total snii mechanical energy is @xmath1210@xmath34 erg ,",
    "@xmath35 is essentially the acceleration efficiency .",
    "we assume that @xmath35 is independent of @xmath0 .    the calculated @xcite @xmath36fe yields , averaged over the imf given above , range from about 0.09 to 0.14 m@xmath5 per snii .",
    "as already indicated , we adopt the constant value of 0.1 , leading to a required be production per snii of 3.6@xmath910@xmath13 atoms independent of @xmath0 . then for the snii , crs and sn60 compositions , for which @xmath30 is independent of @xmath0 , @xmath37$]@xmath83.6@xmath910@xmath18 . requiring an acceleration efficiency less than about 0.3 , @xmath30@xmath381.2@xmath910@xmath39 .",
    "this effectively rules out cutoff energies @xmath29@xmath1950 mev / n , as well as the ssz case .",
    "the latter is also ruled because of its dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "2 shows @xmath40 , the accelerated particle produced b - be ratio , for all cases except ssz .",
    "@xmath40 is practically independent of @xmath0 , implying that ( b / be)@xmath41 can remain constant as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the calculated @xmath40 ranges from about 10 to 30 , depending on the accelerated particle spectrum and composition .",
    "@xmath2b can also be produced by @xmath4 spallation in supernovae @xcite . by averaging the calculated @xmath2b yields over the same imf",
    ", we obtain a @xmath4-induced @xmath2b production of @xmath86@xmath910@xmath42m@xmath5 per snii , practically independent of metallicity . for the total b - to - be inventory ratio we thus have      where m@xmath44 is the @xmath4-produced @xmath2b in units of 10@xmath42m@xmath5 . the second term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is simply determined by the numbers of @xmath36fe and @xmath4-produced @xmath2b per snii , and the observed be / fe ratio .",
    "the observed b / be is quite uncertain , mainly because of nlte effects .",
    "adopting the range 9@xmath19b / be@xmath1934 @xcite for low metallicity stars , the maximum contribution of @xmath4 spallation , m@xmath44@xmath88 , is obtained for the minimal ( b / be)@xmath41@xmath810 corresponding to production by accelerated particles extending to gev energies in the closed galaxy model .",
    "this upper limit slightly exceeds the predicted @xmath2b production by neutrinos @xcite .",
    "for the other accelerated particle compositions , @xmath40 is larger and consequently the maximal m@xmath44 is smaller .",
    "for example ,",
    "for snii with @xmath45mev / n , @xmath40@xmath818 and hence m@xmath44@xmath465 , a limit which is slightly lower than the predicted value .    fig .  3 shows @xmath47 together with the meteoritic b isotopic ratio of about 4 .",
    "this isotopic ratio can not be reproduced by hecr which yield an isotopic ratio less than about 2.5 ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the addition of the @xmath4-produced @xmath2b can provide the extra @xmath2b .",
    "using eq .",
    "( 1 ) we obtain @xmath2b/@xmath16b= [ 3m@xmath48/(b / be)@xmath41 ] [ ( @xmath2b/@xmath16b)@xmath41 + 1 ] + ( @xmath2b/@xmath16b)@xmath41 , where @xmath50 includes both the accelerated particle and @xmath4-produced @xmath2b . if for the low metallicity stars @xmath50 equals the solar system value of 4 , then for the various models 0@xmath19m@xmath48@xmath192 , i.e. ranging from a negligible @xmath4 contribution to less than about 30% of the predicted value .",
    "4 shows @xmath51 . for the compositions that we use ,",
    "this ratio also remains constant as a function of @xmath0 allowing us to compare production and inventory abundance ratios .",
    "a value of 0.05@xmath520.02 for @xmath3li / li was observed at @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the error bar ( sln ) shown at this metallicity is based on this observation , and on the observed li / h ( spite plateau , error @xmath5247% ) and be / h at @xmath53 , for which we estimate an error of @xmath5250% .",
    "we see that snii with @xmath29@xmath850mev / n produces more @xmath3li relative to be than both hecr and sn60 .",
    "hecr underproduce @xmath3li because the @xmath54 cross section is relatively low at high energies ; and sn60 underproduces @xmath3li because of the low @xmath7 particle abundance .",
    "although the large error bar of the sln data does not allow us to discriminate between the models , these data favor snii with @xmath29@xmath850mev / n rather than either hecr or sn60 .",
    "on the other hand , the meteoritic @xmath3li / be at @xmath0=1 ( fig .",
    "4 ) is consistent with these models suggesting that the libeb at the time of the formation of the solar system resulted from more than one accelerated particle component .",
    "we mention in addition that the high @xmath51 implied by snii with @xmath29@xmath850mev / n tends to overproduce li / h at @xmath0 greater than about 0.1 . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the sn60 model was used in a recent galactic abundance evolution study @xcite .",
    "but as we see from fig .  4 , sn60 undeproduces @xmath3li at low metallicity .",
    "our conclusion concerning this @xmath3li differs from a previous one @xcite , namely that the observed @xmath3li abundance can be accounted for by hecr spallation .",
    "that suggestion was based on the assumption that the composition of the hecr is the same as that of the interstellar medium at low metallicity ( i.e. ssz ) , in which case the high he to cno ratio for the accelerated particles would indeed yield a high @xmath3li / be .",
    "but , as we have seen , such a composition fails energetically to account for the be abundance and does not yield a constant be / fe ratio ."
