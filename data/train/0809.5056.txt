    "quasar absorption spectra provide excellent probes of the distribution of baryons in the high - redshift universe . damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas , historically defined as having a neutral hydrogen column density @xmath9@xmath10 ) are particularly useful as they are likely to play an important role as a reservoir of gas for the formation of stars and galaxies at high redshift .",
    "they dominate the neutral gas content of the universe between @xmath11 , and at @xmath12 their neutral gas content is comparable to visible stellar mass in present - day galaxies @xcite .",
    "dlas thus form an important link between primordial plasma and the stellar structures that form from it .    in spite of observations of over 1000 dlas , still conclude that the question `` what is a damped @xmath2system ? '' has not yet been answered conclusively .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that absorption spectra provide only indirect information in velocity space , and only probe the gas along one line - of - sight through the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath2absorption feature itself provides no information about the velocity structure of the dla , because of the large optical depth even in the damping wings .",
    "this has led observers to look at the associated low ionization metal absorption features .",
    "low ionization species like siii , cii and fei are believed to be good tracers of the neutral gas in dlas .",
    "@xcite developed the velocity width distribution of metal absorption features into an important diagnostic tool for dlas .",
    "the much lower absorption optical depth allows us to extract detailed kinematical information for the gas in dlas .",
    "the absorption profiles are normally clumpy and asymmetric , with the strongest absorption feature often occurring at one edge of the profile .",
    "velocity widths range from 30@xmath13 up to several hundred @xmath13 .",
    "note , however , that there is a distinctive lack of very narrow absorption profiles .",
    "kinematical models aiming to reproduce the velocity width data fall into two categories .",
    "@xcite suggested a close connection between dlas and disks of present - day spiral galaxies .",
    "@xcite modelled dlas as thick rotating disks with a rotation speed ( @xmath14 ) typical of present - day galaxies .",
    "@xcite challenged this interpretation and demonstrated that it is not unique .",
    "the merging of proto - galactic clumps expected in cold dark matter ( cdm)-like models for structure formation can explain the shape of the profiles equally well .",
    "galactic winds are also likely to play an important role ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they further showed that for the same virial velocity width , merging clumps produce significantly larger velocity width and argued that the latter interpretation is favoured by the observed velocity width distribution in the context of the cdm paradigm for structure formation @xcite .",
    "the level of enrichment with metals provides another important clue as to the nature of dlas  see for reviews .",
    "significant metal absorption is found in all dlas , though as a population they are metal poor .",
    "dlas are also relatively dust free . initially , the low metallicity was used to argue that dla host galaxies are the chemically unevolved but otherwise very similar counter - parts of typical present - day spiral galaxies @xcite . in the model of @xcite , dlas instead preferentially probe the outer parts of much less massive galaxies , many of which end up as building blocks of typical present - day galaxies that form by hierarchical merging in cdm - like models for structure formation .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated that such a model fits the observed metallicity of dlas at @xmath1 very well .",
    "models of dlas invariably predict more than quasar absorption features can in principle test . as already mentioned , absorption is measured along a single line of sight and thus is a one - dimensional probe of the properties of the dla . to explore the spatial extent and structure of the dla",
    ", we need to observe dlas in emission .",
    "attempts to do this have focussed on both line and continuum emission .",
    "@xmath2emission holds great potential in this respect .",
    "star - formation , cooling radiation and fluorescent re - emission of the meta - galactic uv background are all expected to contribute at different levels .",
    "in addition , stellar continuum emission from the newly formed stars should also be bright enough to be detectable .",
    "many observers have attempted to find the galaxy counterparts of dlas at high redshift in emission by searching adjacent to quasar sightlines with known absorption systems .",
    "this is a difficult task , as the light of the extremely bright quasar must be accurately subtracted to study the light of the galaxy , which is very faint in comparison . @xcite and others caution of the possibility that a given emission feature is a point source function ( psf ) artefact rather than a real source .",
    "report that , for @xmath15 , six dla galaxies have been confirmed through spectroscopic observation of @xmath2emission , with other techniques producing a few additional candidates . added another six @xmath2emission candidates to this group .",
    "a quantitative statistical interpretation of the many ( largely unsuccessful ) searches is difficult if not impossible , but the rather low success rate appears to be consistent with their interpretation as galaxies of rather low mass and star formation rate .",
    "@xcite reported the results of a long - slit search for low surface brightness @xmath2emitters at redshift @xmath16 , which reached flux levels that are about a 10 times lower than previous @xmath2surveys at this redshift .",
    "they found 27 faint line emitters , many of which are extended in wavelength and real space .",
    "they argue that the majority of the emitters are likely to be @xmath2(rather than low-@xmath17 interlopers ) , powered by a central region of star formation and processed by radiative transfer through surrounding neutral hydrogen .",
    "@xcite note that the incidence rate inferred from the space density and the size distribution of the emitters is similar to that of dlas , and suggest that they are the host population of dlas and high column density lyman limit systems ( lls ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case then the observations of @xcite give us  for the first time  the size distribution and space density of dla host galaxies ( figure 19 of * ? ? ?",
    "models predicting the velocity width and size distribution of dlas have been constructed based on the observed luminosity function of galaxies @xcite and on the press - schechter formalism @xcite in conjunction with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "more recently numerical simulations have attempted to model the entire dla population self - consistently @xcite .    in this paper , we revisit models for the absorption properties of dlas in the light of the size distribution data of @xcite , improved data on the velocity width distribution from metal absorption lines ( which has presented a challenge to purely numerical simulations  see @xcite ) and numerical simulations with increased resolution , box size and sophistication incorporating the additional physics of radiative transfer , gas chemistry and star formation .    throughout this work we use cosmological parameters of the 5 year wmap data @xcite : @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite argued that their population of faint @xmath2emitters is the same or has at least a large overlap with that of dla / lls host galaxies .",
    "they further pointed out that the space density and sizes should agree well with those predicted by the dla model of @xcite , which models dlas in the context of cdm models of structure formation .",
    "we here revisit and update this model to investigate whether it can explain the properties of dlas and the new population of faint emitters , assuming that these are the same objects .",
    "we start with summarizing the salient properties of the model . as discussed in the introduction , _ ab initio _ numerical simulation of the gas at the centre of galaxies , where complex non - linear gas physics including star formation and the associated feedback are important ,",
    "is still very challenging .",
    "the haehnelt et al .",
    "model therefore takes a hybrid approach , using a combination of press - schechter formalism and results from numerical simulations to model the kinematic properties of dlas ( see @xcite for a semi - analytical model of dlas that explicitly models feedback ) .",
    "the model uses the space density of dm halos as a proxy for the space density of dla host galaxies . with the refinement to the ps . formalism introduced by @xcite ,",
    "the number of dark matter halos per unit comoving volume at redshift @xmath17 with mass ( baryonic + cdm ) in the interval @xmath19 can be estimated as , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the rms fluctuation amplitude of the cosmic density field in spheres containing mass @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the present cosmic matter ( baryonic + cdm ) density , @xmath24 , @xmath25 $ ] .",

    "we have used the fitting formula in @xcite to calculate the matter power spectrum .",
    "we will be interested in the kinematic properties of dlas , for which the virial velocity is a more convenient quantity to characterize the dm halo than the mass .",
    "the two are related as follows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the overdensity of the halo ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we use a simple power - law relation between virial velocity of dm halo and absorption cross section @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are parameters .",
    "the value of @xmath34 has been the source of some controversy , due to numerical simulations still finding it challenging to reliably model the spatial distribution of the gas in the high - density region probed by dlas and lls . @xcite",
    "originally favoured a value of @xmath36 ( at @xmath37 , for a @xmath3cdm cosmology ) , but their later work revised this to @xmath38 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that this low value of @xmath34 is incompatible with the observed dla velocity widths .",
    "@xcite found that the observed velocity width distribution of metal - lines is reproduced well with a value of @xmath39 , which we also use here .",
    "haehnelt et al . further found that they needed to introduce a lower cut - off in virial velocity in order to fit the velocity width distribution of low - ionization absorption systems .",
    "otherwise their model predicted too many very narrow metal absorption systems , which are not observed .",
    "they therefore assumed that dm halos with virial velocities smaller than a minimum velocity @xmath40 do not host dlas .    here",
    "we will slightly relax this assumption and model the suppression of the cross - section of dlas in halos with small circular velocities as a gentler exponential decline , @xmath41 we consider a range of values for the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that a sharp cut - off corresponds to @xmath44 .",
    "it remains to choose the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "we will follow @xcite by fixing @xmath35 so that the overall rate of incidence of absorbers per unit redshift @xmath45 agrees with the observational value , @xmath46 we take the value of @xmath47 at @xmath48 , which is consistent with @xmath49 @xcite .",

    "the distribution peaks at @xmath62 , dropping to zero below @xmath63 and above @xmath64 .",
    "the numerical simulations on which the distribution is based did not contain star formation feedback .",
    "simulations have become more sophisticated since then .",
    "we have therefore compared the @xmath65 distribution used here with that from the simulations of ( * ? ? ? * and private communication ) , which incorporate the effects of star formation and supernovae on the kinematics and spatial distribution of the gas in a simple manner .",
    "the differences in @xmath66 is also small , at most @xmath67 .",
    "unless there is a fortuitous cancellation of different effects , this suggests that star formation in the simulations has a small effect on @xmath65 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , given the significant differences in resolution , cosmological volume and additional physics , albeit reassuring for our modelling .",
    "note , however , that the simulations still fail to produce realistic galactic winds , probably due to the rather simplistic fashion in which stellar feedback is incorporated .",

    "the new compilation of velocity width data by extends to significantly larger velocities and appears to require a somewhat larger value of @xmath69 .",
    "the apparent lack of neutral gas in small dark matter halos can be plausibly attributed to the feedback effects of star formation and/or photo - heating due to the meta - galactic uv background . in most numerical simulations and models of galaxy formation",
    ", these feedback mainly affects halos with somewhat smaller virial velocities than this .",
    "so either halos with small virial velocities have larger velocity widths than we have assumed here ( i.e. @xmath65 is different ) , or else stellar feedback in halos with virial velocities of @xmath70 is more efficient than generally assumed .",
    "the cumulative velocity width distribution is not very sensitive to the shape of the cut - off for @xmath71 .",
    "the high velocity tail of the velocity distribution as compiled by has proven difficult to reproduce with numerical simulations , which attempt to model the spatial distribution of the neutral gas in dlas self - consistently rather than assume a scaling of the absorption cross section with the virial velocity of dm halos .",
    "generally , the simulations fail to produce a sufficient number of absorption systems with velocity widths as wide as observed .",
    "this is normally attributed by the authors of these studies to the fact that momentum and energy input into the gas due to star formation may not have been modelled with sufficient sophistication @xcite .",
    "we now ask whether our model , which successfully fits the velocity width distribution of the associated low - ionization metal absorption of dlas , can also reproduce the cumulative size distribution of the emission regions of the new population of faint @xmath2emitters , as shown by black solid curve in figure [ fig : plot1 ] ( * ? ? ?",

    "it asymptotes to @xmath73 , which is very similar to the observed incidence rate of dlas at the same redshift . to calculate the cumulative incidence rate for the dla host galaxies in our model ,",
    "we must relate the size of the emission region to the mass of the corresponding dm halo .",
    "we do this simply by assuming that the absorption cross - section is related to radius as if it was a sphere .",

    "the predicted sizes are consistently smaller than the observed sizes by a factor of between 1.5 to 3 , suggesting that the emission regions of the @xmath2emitters are larger than the cross section for damped absorption .",
    "even though the integrated inferred incidence rate is similar to that of dlas , the emission regions of the @xmath2emitters can thus not be identical to the regions responsible for damped @xmath2absorption .",
    "nevertheless , the two can be closely related .            to demonstrate this we now explore a simple model where only a fraction @xmath76 of the halos are emitting @xmath2radiation above the detection threshold at any one time . to keep the total inferred incidence rate fixed ,",
    "we allow the cross section of the individual @xmath2emission regions to be larger than those for damped @xmath2absorption by a corresponding factor @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath2emitters show typical signs of radiative transfer effects , like large velocity widths and asymmetric line profiles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.3 ) , and should thus be optically thick to @xmath2radiation . however , we have no good handle here on the actual column density required to scatter emitted @xmath2at large radii effectively .",
    "it may well be lower than that required for damped absorption , in which case it is very plausible that the region for @xmath2emission extends beyond that for damped @xmath2absorption . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : plot1 ] , the cumulative incidence rate is shown for three values of the duty cycle @xmath78 ) with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "our simple assumption of a duty cycle for the @xmath2emission reconciles the cumulative incidence rate predicted by our model with the observed distribution for sizes below @xmath81 kpc for @xmath82 ( @xmath83 for @xmath84 ) .",
    "the sudden drop in the observed distribution at @xmath85kpc is likely attributable to the following two effects .",
    "the first is the surface brightness limit of the instrument .",
    "light from sources with large radii may be too diffuse to be detected .",
    "the second is the effect of searching a small survey volume .",
    "large systems are rarer , so there is a limit to the size of sources that can be expected to be found within the rather small survey volume .",
    "@xcite considered a number of astrophysical origins for the @xmath2emission that they observe .",
    "they conclude that the most likely mechanism for producing @xmath2photons is star formation .",

    "thus , all the halos can not radiate at the luminosity @xmath99 given by equation for the entire redshift interval over which observations were taken .",
    "there are two ways to make the model consistent .",
    "the first is to impose a duty cycle , so that at any one time , only a fraction @xmath105 of the halos will be radiating . the second is to reduce the luminosity of each emitter , so that the gravitational energy of the halo is radiated over @xmath106 myrs .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : cool ] compares our prediction of @xmath107 with the observed luminosity function as given in figure 9 of @xcite , shown in black .",

    "so far we have assumed ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that all gravitational binding energy is converted into @xmath2radiation . in reality , hot accretion flows could result in substantial amounts of bremsstrahlung and he@xmath108 line emission @xcite , at the expense of @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , the observed luminosities have not been corrected for slit losses which can be as large as a factor of a few .",
    "we therefore conclude that cooling radiation is indeed unlikely to contribute significantly to the majority of the faint @xmath2emitters .",
    "this further supports the suggestion by @xcite that the emitters are predominantly powered by centrally concentrated star formation surrounded by extended @xmath2halos . by stacking the spectra of a subset of the emitters",

    "we caution , however , that the significance of the apparent turn - over at @xmath118 at the faint end of the observed luminosity function is uncertain . at faint flux levels",
    "the luminosity function will be affected strongly by the sensitivity limit of the observations .",

    "the decline of the contribution to the incidence rate with increasing mass is much faster than the decline of the space density of massive halos .",

    "<S> the recently discovered population of ultra - faint extended line emitters , with fluxes of a few times @xmath0 at @xmath1 , can account for the majority of the incidence rate of damped @xmath2systems ( dlas ) at this redshift if the line emission is interpreted as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that a model similar to that proposed by @xcite , which explains the incidence rate and kinematics of dlas in the context of @xmath3cdm models for structure formation , also reproduces the size distribution of the new population of faint @xmath2emitters for plausible parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this lends further support to the interpretation of the emission as @xmath2 , as well as the identification of the emitters with the hitherto elusive population of dla host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the observed incidence rate of dlas together with the observed space density and size distribution of the emitters suggest a duty cycle of @xmath4 for the @xmath2emission from dla host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that @xmath2cooling is expected to contribute little to the @xmath2emission for the majority of emitters . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves centrally concentrated star formation at a rate of a few tenths @xmath5yr@xmath6 , surrounded by extended @xmath2halos with radii up to 30 - 50 kpc , as the most plausible explanation for the origin of the emission . </S>",
    "<S> both the luminosity function of @xmath2emission and the velocity width distribution of low ionization absorption require that galaxies inside dark matter ( dm ) halos with virial velocities @xmath7 contribute little to the incidence rate of dlas at @xmath1 , suggesting that energy and momentum input due to star formation efficiently removes gas from these halos . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies with dm halos with virial velocities of @xmath8 appear to account for the majority of dla host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> dla host galaxies at @xmath1 should thus become the building blocks of typical present - day galaxies like our milky way .    </S>",
