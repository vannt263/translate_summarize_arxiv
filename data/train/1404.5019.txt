    "compressive sampling and multi - coset sampling have drawn a lot of interest from the signal processing community due to the possibility to reconstruct a signal sampled at sub - nyquist rate with no or little information loss under the constraint that the signal is sparse in a particular basis  @xcite .",
    "all these works on sub - nyquist sampling are important especially when it is needed to relax the requirements on the analog - to - digital converters ( adcs ) . for a wide - sense stationary ( wss ) signal",
    ", it has also been shown that perfect reconstruction of its second - order statistics from sub - nyquist rate samples is theoretically possible even without sparsity constraint  @xcite .",
    "this invention is important for some applications , such as wideband spectrum sensing for cognitive radio , where only perfect reconstruction of the temporal auto - correlation function is required instead of the signal itself .",
    "the principle of reconstructing the temporal auto - correlation function of a signal from the time - domain compressive measurements has in a dual form also been proposed in the spatial domain . given a linear antenna array ,  @xcite and  @xcite",
    "show that if the locations of the antennas are arranged according to a nested or coprime array , the spatial correlation values between the outputs of the antennas in the array can be used to generate the spatial correlation values between the outputs of the antennas in the virtual array or difference co - array ( which is uniform in this case ) which generally has more antennas and a larger aperture than the actual array .",
    "this enhances the degrees of freedom and allows  @xcite and  @xcite to estimate the direction of arrival ( doa ) of more uncorrelated sources than sensors . the minimum redundancy array ( mra ) of  @xcite",
    "can also be used to produce this feature but in a more optimal way .",
    "this has been exploited by  @xcite to perform compressive angular power spectrum reconstruction .",
    "the advantage offered by the nested and coprime arrays over the mra however , is the possibility to derive a closed - form expression for the array geometry and the achievable number of correlation values in the resulting uniform difference co - array . in the aforementioned concept ,",
    "the spatial compression is performed in the sense that we select a subset of antennas from a uniform linear array ( ula ) . in this paper , we jointly reconstruct both the frequency - domain and angular - domain power spectrum using compressive samples .",
    "we use a ula as the underlying array and activate only some of its antennas leading to a spatial - domain compression .",
    "the received signal at each active antenna is then sampled at sub - nyquist - rate using multi - coset sampling .",
    "next , we compute all the correlation values between the resulting sub - nyquist rate samples at all active antennas both in the time domain and the spatial domain and use them to reconstruct the two - dimensional ( 2d ) power spectrum matrix where each row gives the power spectrum in the frequency domain for a given angle and where each column contains the power spectrum in the angular domain for a given frequency .",
    "further , we can estimate the doa of the sources active at each frequency by locating the peaks in the angular power spectrum .",
    "this 2d power spectrum reconstruction can be done for more uncorrelated sources than active sensors without any sparsity constraint on the true power spectrum .",
    "first , consider a ula having @xmath0 antennas receiving signals from @xmath1 uncorrelated wss sources .",
    "we assume that the distance between the sources and the ula is large enough compared to the length of the ula and thus the wave incident on the ula is assumed to be planar and the sources can be assumed as point sources .",
    "we also assume that the inverse of the bandwidth of the aggregated incoming signals is larger than the propagation delay across the ula , which allows us to represent the delay between the antennas as a phase shift .",
    "based on these assumptions , we can write the ula output as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 output vector containing the received signal at the @xmath0 antennas of the ula , @xmath5 is the @xmath4 additive white gaussian noise vector , @xmath6^t$ ] is the @xmath7 extended source vector with @xmath8 the incoming signal from the investigated angle @xmath9 , and @xmath10 $ ] is the @xmath11 extended array manifold matrix with @xmath12 the @xmath4 array response vector containing the phase shifts experienced by @xmath8 at each element of the ula .",
    "note that @xmath13 is known and might only approximately contain the actual doas of the @xmath1 sources .",
    "we generally assume that @xmath5 and @xmath14 are uncorrelated , that the impact of the wireless channel has been taken into account in @xmath14 , and that the noises at different antennas are uncorrelated with variance @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16=\\sigma_n^2 { \\bf i}_{n_s}$ ] , with @xmath17 the @xmath18 identity matrix .",
    "we consider the first element of the ula as a reference point and express the array response vector @xmath12 as @xmath19^t$ ] , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the distance between two consecutive antennas in wavelengths , which is set to @xmath22 in order to prevent spatial aliasing .    in order to simplify the further analysis",

    "further , in the receiver branches associated with the @xmath38 active antennas , time - domain compression is performed by sampling the received analog signal at sub - nyquist - rate using the multi - coset sampling principle discussed in  @xcite , which can be implemented using the practical sampling device proposed in  @xcite . here ,",

    "<S> we introduce a new compressive power spectrum estimation approach in both frequency and direction of arrival ( doa ) . </S>",
    "<S> wide - sense stationary signals produced by multiple uncorrelated sources are compressed in both the time and spatial domain where the latter compression is implemented by activating only some of the antennas in the underlying uniform linear array ( ula ) . </S>",
    "<S> we sample the received signal at every active antenna at sub - nyquist rate , compute both the temporal and spatial correlation functions between the sub - nyquist rate samples , and apply least squares to reconstruct the full - blown two - dimensional power spectrum matrix where the rows and columns correspond to the frequencies and the angles , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible under the full column rank condition of the system matrices and without applying any sparsity constraint on the signal statistics . </S>",
    "<S> further , we can estimate the doas of the sources by locating the peaks of the angular power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we can theoretically estimate the frequency bands and the doas of more uncorrelated sources than active sensors using sub - nyquist sampling . </S>"
