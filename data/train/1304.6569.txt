    "the karlsruhe tritium neutrino ( katrin ) experiment @xcite is designed to determine the absolute neutrino mass scale with a sensitivity of 200 mev by a precise measurement of the electron energy spectrum close to the endpoint @xmath4 of molecular tritium . in the 70 m long setup ( see fig . [ figbeamline ] ) , electrons are guided from the source to the detector by magnetic fields in the range of a few t , which are created by many superconducting coils .",

    "the 70 m long katrin setup ( see fig . [ figbeamline ] ) contains the following main components :    high - purity molecular tritium gas with a temperature of 30 k is injected into the middle of the 10 m long and 9 cm diameter tube of the wgts ( windowless gaseous tritium source ) .",
    "the injected gas diffuses to both ends of the wgts beam tube , where it is pumped out to a large degree by a total of 4 pumping ports @xcite .",
    "a system of 21 superconducting coils generates a high ( 3.6 t  5.6 t ) magnetic field , which guides the @xmath0-decay electrons out of the source along magnetic field lines .",
    "the transport section downstream of the wgts consists of two main tritium retention systems : the dps ( differential pumping section ) and the cps ( cryogenic pumping section ) . both components together eliminate the remaining tritium gas from the beamline , thus preventing tritium migration to the main spectrometer .",
    "this is of major importance , as even trace amounts of tritium in the main spectrometer would cause an untolerably large background rate and initiate large systematic effects , through the @xmath0-decays of the tritium molecules . to prevent this ,",
    "the tritium gas at first is differentially pumped out at the 4 main pump ports of the dps @xcite .",
    "second , the remaining tritium is trapped on to the cold inner surfaces of the cps @xcite .",
    "the beam tube of both cryostats is operated at high magnetic fields up to 5.5 t , in order to guide the @xmath0-decay electrons towards the main spectrometer .",
    "this magnetic field is created by 5 and 7 superconducting coils in the dps and cps , respectively .",
    "some of these coils are not coaxial with the main beamline , in order to reduce the molecular beaming effect @xcite .",
    "as the transport section also filters out positive ions , only electrons are transmitted to the electrostatic spectrometers for energy analysis .    at first , a smaller spectrometer ( pre - spectrometer ) at the entry of the spectrometer section allows to filter out the low - energy part of the @xmath0-spectrum which is not important for the neutrino mass determination ( since the energy is not close to the endpoint ) .",
    "in fact , the potential of the pre - spectrometer can be adjusted from 0 up to -18.3 kv , thus optimizing the background level as a function of the filter potential @xcite .",
    "the pre - spectrometer has two superconducting coils at the ends : both of them have a reference field of 4.5 t at the coil centre , and they generate a 15 mt field in the middle of this spectrometer . in the following we refer to the source - side magnet ( between cps and pre - spectrometer ) as ps 1 coil , and the other one ( between pre- and main spectrometer ) as ps 2 coil . due to the magnetic field of these coils ,",
    "the @xmath0 electrons are adiabatically guided through the pre - spectrometer , even when operated at low or zero potential @xcite .    the very large main spectrometer ( length 23.6 m , diameter 10 m ) has the task of precision energy filtering so that only electrons with high enough kinetic energy are able to overcome the electrostatic retarding potential to be transmitted to the detector for counting .",
    "all electrons with smaller kinetic energy are reflected and move back to the source .",
    "however , the electric field inside the main spectrometer is able to filter only the longitudinal kinetic energy @xmath6 of the electrons , but not the transversal energy @xmath7 ( the longitudinal energy is defined by the electron velocity component parallel to the magnetic field direction ) .",
    "as @xmath0-decay electrons in the source are created with isotropic angular distribution , a significant part of their energy can be transversal .",
    "if their transversal energy component @xmath7 remained unaltered , most of the electrons with total energy near the endpoint would not reach the detector , resulting in a rather poor statistics .",
    "the solution for this problem is to significantly reduce the magnetic field strength towards the center of main spectrometer .",
    "the corresponding field configuration has been designed to first order so that the motion of @xmath0-electrons in the katrin system is adiabatic @xcite .",
    "therefore the first adiabatic invariant ( proportional to transversal energy per magnetic field ) is approximately constant ( see eq .",
    "[ gammamu ] in the next section for the relativistic expression of this adiabatic invariant ) . consequently ,",
    "when the @xmath0-decay electrons move from high to small magnetic field ( i.e. from the entry to the centre of the main spectrometer ) , most of their transversal kinetic energy is converted into longitudinal energy . in doing so , it is important to keep the appropriate order : first the conversion of transversal to longitudinal energy has to take place before the reflecting electric field",
    " eats up  all the longitudinal energy of the electron ( see the next section for more details ) .    due to the non - zero magnetic field inside the main spectrometer , this conversion is not perfect ,",
    "thus the electrons will retain a small transversal energy . as this energy",
    "is not scanned by the electrostatic retarding potential , it also defines the energy resolution of the experiment . with a reference value of the magnetic field in the middle of the main spectrometer of 0.3 mt ( which is 20000 times smaller than the maximal field of 6 t in the katrin setup ) , the energy resolution of katrin ( defining the width of transmission from @xmath8 % for an isotropic source )",
    "will be 0.93 ev at 18.6 kev electron energy .    the conversion from transveral to longitudinal energy is also called magnetic adiabatic collimation ( the electron velocity directions are collimated parallel to the magnetic field ) , and a spectrometer using electrostatic retardation together with magnetic adiabatic collimation , like the katrin main spectrometer , is called a mac - e filter @xcite .",
    "thus the katrin experiment , like the pioneering mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite neutrino mass experiments , will make use of the mac - e filter principle to measure the neutrino mass .",
    "a @xmath0-decay electron coming from the source follows a specific magnetic field line , to a good approximation .",
    "therefore the @xmath0-decay electrons created inside the transported magnetic flux tube ( defined by the reference magnetic flux value of 191 t@xmath9 ) will always remain inside this flux tube until they are counted by the detector . since the magnetic field in the main spectrometer will be a factor of @xmath10 times smaller than the field @xmath11 in the source",
    ", the diameter of the flux tube has to be enlarged by a factor of 100 relative to the source .",
    "therefore , the main spectrometer diameter has to be very large ( about 10 m ) . in order to minimize electron interactions with residual gas molecules ,",
    "the main spectrometer should also feature an excellent ultrahigh vacuum .",
    "the main spectrometer has 3 nearby superconducting coils : at the source side the abovementioned ps 2 coil , and at the detector side the pinch ( pch ) and the detector ( det ) coils . the latter two together have a significantly larger magnetic moment than the ps 2 coil alone , therefore the magnetic field of the superconducting coils inside the main spectrometer is asymmetric : it is larger at the detector side than near the source side ( note that the stray field of a coil is proportional to its magnetic moment )",
    ".    table [ tabsuper ] shows the central axial positions and the typical maximal fields of the 3 superconducting coil systems ( wgts , dps , cps ) and the 4 superconducting coils ( ps1 , ps2 , pch , det ) .",
    "in addition , this table presents the contributions of the various superconducting coil systems to the magnetic field at the center ( @xmath12 ) of the main spectrometer . in sec .",
    "[ seclfcs ] we explain the negative sign of these field values .",
    ".axial magnetic field contributions @xmath13 at the center of main spectrometer ( @xmath14 ) from the horizontal earth field and from the various superconducting coil systems and coils .",

    "normal neutrino mass measurement conditions the magnetic field at the center ( @xmath17 ) of the spectrometer should be larger than a minimum value of 0.33 mt , so that the reference 191 @xmath18 flux tube fits into the spectrometer tank .",
    "the field of the superconducting coils at the center contributes with about 0.2 mt , therefore the overall magnetic field direction of the lfcs has to be the identical to the field direction of the superconducting coils .",
    "if a higher magnetic field in the middle of the main spectrometer is required , the background level is expected to be reduced significantly , but then the transmission function is broader , i.e. the energy resolution is worse .    as outlined above",
    ", the field of the superconducting coils is rather asymmetric with regard to the middle plane , since their stray field at the detector side of the main spectrometer is larger than at the source side ( see also fig .",
    "[ figfluxtube2 ] ) . with the lfcs it is possible to compensate this asymmetry to a large extent . for this purpose ,",
    "the lfcs coil 14 at the detector side ( see fig .",
    "[ figfieldlines ] ) will be used as a counter coil with a current direction opposite to all other coils .",
    "as this task requires a rather large amperturn value , coil 14 consists of 2 parts , each of them having 14 windings with slightly different axial coordinates ( see table [ tablfcs ] ) .",
    "the currents of the lfcs coils have to be optimized so that the transmission condition is fulfilled .",
    "this task can best be realized if the superconducting stray field is smaller and the lfcs field is larger .",
    "accordingly , we define the katrin magnetic field direction opposite to the horizontal earth magnetic field direction . in this layout",
    ", the earth field reduces the stray field of the superconducting coils , as desired .",
    "as outlined earlier , a big advantage in this regard is that the main spectrometer axis has approximately a south - to - north direction ( detector side is at north ) .",
    "accordingly , the axial ( @xmath19 ) component of the earth magnetic field has source - to - detector direction ( 20 @xmath20 t ; see table [ tabsuper ] ) .",
    "this allows to choose a detector - to - source ( negative ) direction for the katrin magnetic field , in order to reduce the superconducting stray field by the horizontal earth field .    as we have mentioned in the beginning of this section ,",
    "the lfcs coils allow to adjust many different magnetic field configurations : with various field magnitude values up to 1 mt , with one minimum or two minima field solutions , and with different superconducting fields . in our paper , we present two generic field configurations : first , a configuration with one global magnetic field minimum for all field lines , and second , a configuration with 2 local minima and a local maximum for off - axis field lines . in both cases ,",
    "the field at the center of the main spectrometer is 0.35 mt . for these calculations",
    "we have included the contributions from all superconducting coils of the katrin system .",
    "table [ tabsuper ] shows the central axial positions , central fields and field contributions at the main spectrometer center for the 7 superconducting coil systems and coils .    in order to determine the optimized lfcs coil currents , we have used an optimization procedure based on reasonable initial values for the currents .",
    "then we computed the magnetic field lines inside the flux tube ( fig .",
    "[ figfieldlines ] ) , as well as the magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ figmagfield ] ) and the adiabatic longitudinal energy ( fig .",
    "[ figelong ] ) of an electron along these field lines .",
    "note that these figures correspond to the final optimized current values ; in the initial stages of our optimization simulations the parameters looked differently .",
    "for example , it occurred that the outer field lines crossed the main spectrometer tank or electrodes , so that one had to increase the absolute value of the lfcs coil currents to increase the magnetic field inside the main spectrometer . if the field lines had a too large diameter in some local region , one had to increase the current values only for the coils near that region .",
    "in addition , an important design goal was to set the lfcs currents so that the magnetic field along the field lines ( fig .",
    "[ figmagfield ] ) is approximately symmetric relative to the @xmath12 plane : in that case one has better chances to fulfill the transmission condition .",
    "the latter could be tested by the longitudinal energy figures ( fig .",
    "[ figelong ] ) .",
    "after a few iterations of changing the current values , it was possible to find a configuration which approximately fulfilled the above criteria",
    ".    however , after this so called optimization - by - eye procedure , the analyzing points for various starting points and starting angles still had some spread ( lying within a region of a few times 10 cm size ) . in order to reduce substantially the distances between these analyzing points",
    ", we used a mathematical optimization method based on several objectives ( multiobjective optimization ) , minimizing the composite objective function by the downhill simplex method @xcite .",
    "the objective function depends on the 14 lfcs coil currents , therefore the optimization proceeds in this case in a 14 dimensional parameter space .",
    "the results of the optimization - by - eye method served as useful starting points for the mathematical optimization procedure . in this way we were able to improve significantly the transmission properties of the field configurations ( see below ) .",
    "we give a detailed explanation of our mathematical optimization method in [ appendix - mathoptim ] .",
    "table [ tablfcs ] shows the resulting lfcs coil current values for the two field configurations ( 1 minimum and 2 minima ) , based on the abovementioned optimizations . in both cases , the current of coil 14 is positive , i.e. opposite to the sign of all other superconducting and lfcs air coils . in this way",
    "the lfcs coil 14 can compensate ( at least in the smaller field region ) the asymmetry resulting from the larger stray fields of the pinch and detector coils .",
    "[ figmagfieldsuper ] shows that the on - axis field without the lfcs coils is larger in the positive @xmath19 region ( detector side ) ; with the lfcs coils this asymmetry becomes smaller .",
    "it is also noticeable in table [ tablfcs ] that for the 2 minima configuration the central coils 7 and 8 have to be operated with rather large current values , because in this case the magnetic field is designed to have a local maximum at the center ( @xmath12 ) of the off - axis field lines",

    "[ figfieldlines ] shows the shape of 5 selected magnetic field lines for both field configurations ( 1 minimum and 2 minima ) after the abovementioned optimizations . in each case",
    "the outer field lines correspond to the 191 @xmath21 flux tube .",
    "one can see that the flux tube fits well into the spectrometer tank , in either case with some safety distance ( about 40 cm ) from the inner wire electrode .",
    "close to the analyzing plane the field lines display a high degree of symmetry relative to the @xmath12 plane , while farther away at the detector side the field lines attain a smaller diameter than at the source side ( due to the higher stray field of the pinch and detector coils ) .",
    "the lfcs coils are also indicated in these figures by the points at @xmath22 m and @xmath23 m. only those 3 superconducting coils are displayed here which are closest to the main spectrometer ( the ps2 , pch and det coils at @xmath24 m , @xmath25 m and @xmath26 m , respectively ) .",
    "[ figmagfield ] displays ( in an identical color code ) the magnetic field strength along the 5 selected magnetic field lines of fig .",
    "[ figfieldlines ] .",
    "each field line obeys a very good approximate symmetry relative to @xmath12 ( although the field of the superconducting coils alone is quite asymmetric in @xmath19-direction ) , implying that the compensation by the lfcs is successful . in case of the 1-minimum configuration",
    "the field has only 1 rather shallow minimum at @xmath12 , while for the ",
    "2-minima  layout",
    "this only manifests for the inner field lines ( upper curves ) ; the outer field lines ( lower curves ) experience 2 local minima ( a few meters far from the center ) and a local maximum at @xmath12 . as explained before , the latter configuration is more reliable from the transmission condition point - of - view .",
    "a possible disadvantage of these local field minima is that some electrons with velocities almost perpendicular to the magnetic field could be trapped in these minima . in this way",
    "they could cause background by ionizational collisions , in case of sufficient kinetic energy .",
    "however , these electrons will be stored anyway by the magnetic mirror trap of the main spectrometer magnetic field , therefore it is unlikely that the local field minima would result in a significant background increase , in comparison to the expected background rate due to the ionizations caused by high energy stored electrons in the main spectrometer @xcite . of course , this specific background issue has to be investigated experimentally .",
    "[ figelong ] shows the longitudinal energy along the same field lines , for electrons starting with the maximal polar angle @xmath27 and with the transmission energy @xmath28 in the source ( wgts ) . in both cases",
    ", the minimum of the longitudinal energy appears very close to the @xmath12 symmetry point . to zoom into the critical region - of - interest",
    ", we display in fig .",
    "[ figanapoint ] the analyzing points for the minimal and maximal starting polar angles ( @xmath29 for the blue lines , @xmath30 for the red lines ) , but now with a mm scale on the @xmath19-axis , for all field lines with @xmath31 m at the center .",
    "the analyzing points for intermediate starting angles lie between these two curves .",
    "this figure demonstrates that our optimization method for both field configurations results in a very small axial spread of the analyzing points , typically on a scale of a few mm only .",
    "it is not meaningful to further improve these analyzing point curves , because small magnetic and electric field disturbances would change these results .",
    "for example , the magnetic field of the coils is slightly disturbed by the presence of magnetic materials in the main spectrometer building , and the mirror symmetry of the electric field is affected by the detector - facing pumping ports ( which are at the detector side of the main spectrometer ) , resulting in systematic effects of the same order of a few mm . taken together , these results imply that the two generic field configurations described above result in a well - defined analyzing plane with a narrow spread in the few mm range , as desired for high - resolution @xmath0-spectroscopy .",
    "the final important parameter to be investigated is the radial homogeneity of the magnetic field in the analyzing plane ( @xmath12 ) . in fig .",
    "[ figmagap ] we can see clear differences of the two field configurations : the lfcs setup with the 2 minima and local maximum offers a significantly better radial homogeneity than the field configuration with only 1 global minimum . in principle , as outlined above , the magnetic inhomogeneity influences the energy resolution , so a better homogeneity is advantageous .",
    "however , this effect can be mapped out to some extent by the segmented focal plane detector @xcite .",
    "in addition to these two examples of lfcs current setting , we have calculated several other current configurations : scenarios with a higher overall magnetic field in the analyzing plane , and starting configurations with 2 or 4 superconducting coils only . the main spectrometer test experiments , which will be performed in 2013 , will use a configuration with only the ps1 , ps2 , pch and det superconducting coils ( the wgts , dps and cps are at present still under construction ) . for these reasons",
    "it is important to find optimal lfcs current configurations with stray magnetic fields caused by these 4 superconducting solenoids .",
    "one can find optimized lfcs current values for these cases ( with many figures ) in refs .",
    "@xcite .    at the end of this section",
    ", we mention a possible application of the lfcs for the purpose of background reduction . as outlined in sec .",
    "[ seckatrin ] , the mac - e filter principle of the main spectrometer inherently forms a magnetic mirror trap for high - energy electrons .",
    "these trapped electrons undergo many ionizational collisions with residual gas molecules , and the secondary electrons created by these ionizations can cause a significant background increase @xcite . a possible method to remove these trapped electrons",
    "is by reducing the magnetic field in the middle of the main spectrometer for a short time ( e.g. 1 s ) down to zero .",
    "this is possible by reversing the sign of the lfcs currents . using this magnetic pulse method @xcite , all high energy stored electrons",
    "are expected to be removed , and this should reduce significantly the background caused by these electrons .",
    "since the earth magnetic field is homogeneous within the volume of the katrin main spectrometer , it is possible to compensate this field distortion with the help of a homogeneous magnetic field . the widely known method to produce such a homogeneous field",
    "is by circular or squared helmholtz - type coil systems @xcite , where the homogenous field region achieved is , however , significantly smaller than the dimension of the coil system itself . since the building housing the katrin main spectrometer and the lfcs system described above offers no extra space , a helmholtz - type coil method was not a viable method for the earth magnetic field compensation .",
    "another method to obtain a uniform magnetic field is by spherical cosine coils @xcite .",
    "the layout of this system relies on the fact that the magnetic field inside a uniformly magnetized sphere is uniform , with the induction vector @xmath32 being parallel to the magnetization vector @xmath33 @xcite . from the point of view of the field intensity",
    "@xmath34 calculations , the uniform magnetization @xmath33 can be replaced by an equivalent surface current distribution @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the outwardly directed normal vector of the magnetic material surface ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", the equivalent current density is proportional to @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the angle between the normal vector @xmath36 and the plane perpendicular to @xmath33 .",
    "this is the reason for naming this arrangement a cosine coil . in order to build a cosine coil and to get an approximately uniform magnetic field @xmath39 inside the coil ,",
    "the continuous current distribution is replaced by a discrete system of circular current loops , with planes perpendicular to the axis vector @xmath39 and positioned equidistantly along the direction of this vector .",
    "as one can see in table 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the spherical cosine coil system has a much larger region with a specific level of field uniformity than the simple helmholtz coil pair .",
    "unfortunately , a spherical emcs turned out to be impractical too , due to the above mentioned space restrictions by the spectrometer building .",
    "alternatively , a cosine coil system on the surface of an ellipsoid also features a uniform magnetic field inside the ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the 3 large vacuum pumps of the main spectrometer tank ( see fig .",
    "[ figbeamline ] ) would have crossed the surface of this ellipsoid , so the ellipsoid solution turned out to be impractical as well .",
    "now , an infinitely long ellipsoid is identical with an infinitely long cylinder , therefore a cosine coil system on the surface of a cylinder can also be used to produce an approximately uniform magnetic field inside the cylinder . in this arrangement ,",
    "the uniformity of the field increases with the length of the cylinder and with the number of the current loops .",
    "accordingly , an air coil system on the surface of a cylinder surrounding the katrin main spectromer tank turned out to be an optimal solution for the earth magnetic field compensation inside the tank @xcite .",
    "the length and radius of the cylinder was chosen to be 24 m and 6.3 m , respectively .",
    "these dimensions were constrained by the main spectrometer building , and they are identical to the dimensions of the lfcs coils and allow to construct both systems with a single mechanical support structure @xcite . in order to compensate the vertical ( @xmath40 ) component of the earth magnetic field ( 43.6 @xmath20 t ) ,",
    "we have decided to use 16 current loops with horizontal planes ( the blue lines in fig .",
    "[ figmainspec ] ) , and for the horizontal transverse ( @xmath41 ) earth field component ( 5 @xmath20 t ) compensation we use 10 current loops with vertical planes ( the red lines in fig .",

    "[ figloopa ] shows a current loop pair that provides a homogeneous vertical magnetic field at the center of the cylinder .",
    "one loop contains two linear current sections ( both of them parallel with the main spectrometer axis ) and , at the two endrings of the cylinder , two arcs that connect the linear sections , rendering the loop a closed current system .",
    "[ figloopb ] shows that the two closed loops are equivalent to one closed current system that is easier to realize practically .",
    "similarly , the 16 current loops of the vertical system and the 10 loops of the horizontal system are integrated into two independent closed current systems .",
    "thus , the emcs has only two adjustable currents : 50 a to produce a 43.6 @xmath20 t field with the vertical system , and 9.1 a to produce a 5 @xmath20 t field with the horizontal system .",
    "[ figendring ] illustrates the current arcs at one of the endrings in the special case of 6 loops .",
    "the positive signs mean that the current in the linear sections , which here are perpendicular to the page , flows in the direction inside the page , and the minus signs indicate current flow direction outside the page ( towards the reader ) .",
    "this figure shows that the current loop planes are equidistant ( with distance @xmath42 ) .",

    "the final important aspect of the emcs design is the field behaviour along the longitudinal @xmath19-axis . in this regard",
    "it is important to recall that the distorting effects of the earth magnetic field have to be compensated mainly in the low field region @xmath58 m. figure [ figz ] shows that the field inhomogeneity of the horizontal and vertical compensation systems increases with the distance from the analyzing plane ( which is also the center of both the vertical and the horizontal coil system ) .",
    "this increase is due to the finite length of the coil systems and due to the field disturbance from the circular current segments of the endrings .",
    "the lower quality of the compensation systems near the endrings should not cause any problem , since the magnetic field in the regions @xmath59 m is already much larger than the earth magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "[ figmagfield ] ) .",
    "the emcs is useful not only to compensate the earth magnetic field , but also offers the useful possibility to shift the magnetic flux tube .",
    "the vertical and horizontal parts of the emcs allow shifting the flux tube in the vertical and the horizontal direction by 0.5 m , with 75 a and 50 a current , respectively @xcite .",
    "these flux tube shifts can be important in order to correct some small transversal shifts of the flux tube in the transport system , and also for specific background investigations and optimizations .",
    "the katrin experiment will determine the absolute neutrino mass scale down to 200 mev ( 90 % cl ) by measuring the integral electron energy spectrum close to the endpoint of molecular tritium beta decay .",
    "the @xmath0-electrons are guided from the source to the detector by magnetic fields , typically reaching values in the few t range in the source and transport system and being created by many superconducting coils .",
    "the energy filtering of the electrons takes place inside the large volume main spectrometer , which is at high negative potential ( around -18.6 kv ) . in order to convert the transversal energy of the electrons into longitudinal energy by the inverse magnetic mirror effect and thus to improve significantly the efficiency of the energy filtering ,",
    "the magnetic field strength in the main spectrometer must reach very low values below 0.5 mt .",
    "the stray field of the superconducting coils alone is not sufficient to obtain the minimal 0.3 mt field that is needed to constrain the magnetic flux tube to the geometry of the main spectrometer vessel .",
    "moreover , the earth magnetic field disturbs significantly this central low magnetic field region where the energy analysis takes place .",
    "the task of the katrin large - volume air coil system described in this paper is to fine - tune and compensate these fields .",
    "the lfcs ( low field correction system ) part of the air coil system consists of 14 coils arranged coaxially with the main spectrometer vessel and the adjacent superconducting coils . with its help",
    "it is possible to set the magnetic field inside the main spectrometer from zero up to 1 mt .",
    "the homogeneity of the field in the analyzing plane can also be improved considerably . in addition , the asymmetric field of the superconducting coils can be compensated , thus making the field more symmetric relative to the @xmath12 analyzing plane . even more importantly , with the lfcs one can fine - tune the magnetic field shape , adjusting it to the electric potential , so that the adiabatic transmission condition is fulfilled .",
    "thus it is much easier to evaluate accurately the transmission function of the mac - e filter .",
    "the precise knowledge of this function is an essential pre - requisite for a precision scanning of the integral energy spectrum . to fulfill the transmission condition ,",
    "two different possibilities have been worked out : a magnetic field with a global minimum in the analyzing plane , and a field with a local maximum there but with two local minima a few meters away .",
    "the second option has better theoretical properties : an easier fulfillment of the transmission condition and better homogeneity in the analyzing plane . in order to find the optimal lfcs current values corresponding to these field alternatives ,",
    "we have used a relatively simple and fast mathematical optimization method , based on a composite objective function with multiple objectives .",
    "the second part of the air coil system is the emcs whose task is to compensate those components of the earth magnetic field which are perpendicular to the spectrometer axis .",
    "it consists of two cosine coil systems : one of them compensates the vertical earth magnetic field component ( 43.6 @xmath60 ) , the other one compensates the horizontal transversal earth field component ( 9.1 @xmath60 ) . in the analyzing plane of the main spectrometer , both the vertical and the horizontal components can be compensated with 0.3 @xmath20 t maximal inaccuracy , which is fully sufficient for high - precision @xmath0-spectroscopy .",
    "the air coil system was constructed in 2009 - 2010 .",
    "details about its mechanical and electrical layout , and about the commissioning field measurements and comparisons with simulations will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the katrin large volume air coil sytem will be an important experimental component for the main spectrometer commissioning measurements , which will start in the first half of 2013 . the purpose of these measurements is to examine and reduce the background , and to investigate the electric , magnetic and electron transmission properties of the main spectrometer . with the help of the lfcs and emcs , one can set magnetic fields inside the main spectrometer in a highly versatile manner by adjusting both the overall field strength as well as the field shape .",
    "presumably , the background and transmission properties of the main spectrometer depend strongly on the lfcs and emcs currents , and we expect to find current values that result in a rather small background rate and well understood transmission function , in order to obtain optimal conditions for the katrin neutrino mass measurements .",
    "this research was supported by the helmholtz association ( hgf ) , the german federal ministry of education and research ( bmbf ) , through grants 05a08vk2 and 05a11vk3 , and the german research foundation ( dfg ) within the framework of the transregio project neutrinos and beyond , grant sfb / tr27 .",
    "thank the karlsruhe house of young scientists ( khys ) for supporting part of this study .",
    "we would like to thank tudor cristea - platon and nils stallkamp for their useful participation in the mathematical optimization computations , and michaela meloni for her helping us to create some of the figures .",
    "in this work various field simulation codes have been used for the air coil design .",
    "the partopt code @xcite uses elliptic integrals for magnetic field calculations of axisymmetric coils .",
    "in addition , the zonal harmonic expansion method was employed @xcite .",
    "the latter method can be 100 - 1000 times faster than the more widely known elliptic integral method and is more general than the similar radial series expansion .",
    "it features not only high computational speed but also high accuracy , which makes the method appropriate especially for trajectory calculations of charged particles .",
    "we could not use elliptic integrals or the zonal harmonic expansion to simulate the emcs since it is not axisymmetric .",
    "instead , the magnetic field of the linear current sections was computed by integrated biot - savart formulas @xcite .",
    "the arcs at the endrings were approximated by many short linear current segments .    in order to compute the adiabatic longitudinal energy , transmission energy and the analyzing points",
    ", we also performed electric potential calculations .",
    "for this purpose , the boundary element method ( bem ) was applied @xcite . with bem",
    ", one has to discretize only the two - dimensional surface of the electrodes , and not the whole three - dimensional space of the electrode system , as is the case when using the finite difference and finite element methods @xcite .",
    "bem is especially advantageous for electrodes exhibiting small - scale structures within large volumes , like the katrin wire electrode system @xcite . inside the flux tube ,",
    "the electric potential of the main spectrometer wire electrode system is approximately axisymmetric , and with the knowledge of the charge densities from the bem calculations it is possible to use the zonal harmonic expansion method also for the electric potential computations @xcite .",
    "the field calculation c codes , written by one of us ( f. g. ) , have been rewritten into c++ code @xcite and included into the kassiopeia package that is now the standard simulation framework of the katrin experiment @xcite .",
    "optimization problems naturally arise in many different disciplines , like statistics , engineering , management , empirical sciences etc . in mathematical ( numerical ) optimization @xcite ,",
    "first one has to formulate the problem .",
    "this is achieved by defining the design ( optimization , decision ) variables and the objective ( goal or cost ) function that has to be optimized ( usually with some constraints on the design variables ) .",
    "then the optimal values of the design variables leading to a minimum of the objective function have to be found by applying some appropriate minimization technique . for more advanced problems ,",
    "one has typically several different goals and several requirements to be fulfilled simultaneously . in this case",
    "one uses multiobjective ( vector ) optimization , with several objectives to be optimized .",
    "one of the possibilities to formulate this kind of optimization problem is by introducing a composite objective function @xmath61 as the weighted sum of the objectives @xmath62 : @xmath63 the weights @xmath64 have to be used so that the best result for the problem is obtained .",
    "the most important objectives and those with smaller scalings need larger weight factors , so that these objectives should decrease significantly during the optimization procedure .    in our case ,",
    "the design variables are the 14 lfcs currents .",
    "the magnetic field with the optimal current values has to fulfill several different requirements , therefore we have adopted the multiobjective optimization procedure with composite objective function . for the simulations yielding the results of sec .",
    "[ seclfcs ] we have used @xmath65 objectives .    our first objective was the squared deviation of the magnetic field value at the main spectrometer center from an input value : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 ; in our work we have used a value of @xmath68 mt .    our next goal was to find a configuration where the magnetic field and the field lines are approximately perpendicular to the z=0 mirror plane .",
    "in this case one can expect that the analyzing points are very close to this plane .",
    "therefore , for the second objective we have defined an ensemble of @xmath69 points at the @xmath12 mirror plane with @xmath70 radius values ( in meters ) @xmath71 , and we have computed the radial magnetic field components @xmath72 at these points .",
    "the second objective @xmath73 was then defined as the maximum of the @xmath74 values .    as for axisymmetric fields the radial component on the axis (",
    "@xmath75 is always zero , we have used also a third objective .",
    "the goal here was to have a magnetic field with extremum values in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "for this purpose , we have defined the set of 11 points with @xmath70 , @xmath76 , and we have computed there the axial gradient field components @xmath77 . then , the third objective @xmath78 was defined as the maximum of the @xmath79 values . for the computation of the axial gradients we used numerical differentiation : @xmath80/(2\\varepsilon)$ ] , with @xmath81 mm .    in the next step , the composite objective function is the weighted sum of these 3 objectives ( see eq .",
    "[ eqmultiobjective ] for @xmath65 ) .",
    "we have chosen to use the empirical weight factors @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the points where we have computed the magnetic field values are fixed ( they are independent of the optimization procedure ) , therefore we have been able to reduce significantly the required computation time by calculating , in the beginning , for all points the magnetic field contributions @xmath84 of the lfcs coil @xmath85 with 1 a current .",
    "then , during the optimization , the field can be computed rapidly as the linear superposition @xmath86 , where @xmath87 denotes the field due to the superconducting coils and the horizontal earth magnetic field .    to minimize the objective function @xmath61 , starting at some point in the 14 dimensional current space ,",
    "we have used the nelder - mead downhill simplex method ( @xcite , and @xcite , sec .",
    "this popular minimization method requires only the evaluation of functions , and not their derivatives .",
    "it is based on the notion of a simplex that is a geometrical figure having @xmath88 points ( vertices ) in the n - dimensional design variable space ( the simplex is the generalization of a triangle or tetrahedron for higher dimensions ) . in the beginning , a simplex is created near the starting point , and it is changed by various transformations ( reflection , contraction , expansion , shrinkage ) so that the average function value at the simplex vertices continuously decreases , until the simplex attains a local minimum of @xmath61 where no further significant reduction of the function value is possible .    from the technical point of view , the lfcs currents are not allowed to exceed the upper limits presented in table [ tablfcs ] . in our work , we used the following limits : @xmath89 a , @xmath90 for coils 1 - 13 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 a for coil 14 . in order to include these limits as constraints into our optimization code , we introduced the following variable transformation : @xmath93 . using the variables @xmath94 for the function minimization , instead of the currents @xmath95 ,",
    "the constrained optimization is turned into the easier case of unconstrained optimization ( the variables @xmath94 can have arbitrary values , while the currents are constrained between their lower and upper limits ) .    as we have mentioned in sec .",
    "[ seclfcs ] , the starting point for our mathematical optimization procedure was the result of a first , rough optimization - by - eye operation .",
    "we tried our mathematical optimization process also by arbitrary ( randomly chosen ) starting points . in that case , too , the minimization by the simplex method was able to reduce significantly the objective function value and found some local minimum .",
    "unfortunately , in this case the current values of the neighbouring coils corresponding to these local minima featured rather large jumps , resulting in unnecessarily large currents for some of the coils . probably , one has to use some additional objectives ( like the total electric power of the coils ) to avoid these large current jumps .",
    "these on - going investigations , however , will not influence our conclusions presented above .",
