    "type  ia supernovae ( sne ) are considered astronomical standard candles and have been used to measure the geometry and dynamics of the universe @xcite .",
    "this exceedingly difficult measurement relies on observations of local supernovae samples to calibrate relationships between absolute peak magnitude and more easily obtained observables such as light - curve width , color , etc .",
    "( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these calibrations are then applied to the observables in higher redshift samples to derive distance moduli . due to the extreme faintness of intermediate to high redshift sn and the shifting of identifying spectral features outside the optical window ,",
    "spectroscopic classification becomes difficult , and photometry must often suffice .",
    "fortunately , there is a clear observational difference between hydrogen - rich ( type  ii ) and hydrogen - poor ( ia , ib , and ic ) sne , namely , the uv deficit ( uv radiation is blocked in hydrogen - poor sn explosions by metal lines ) .",
    "this property can be used to distinguish between type  i and ii sne explosions . to date",
    "there is no photometric technique to distinguish between type  ia and ibc sn ( although see gal - yam et  al . , 2004 ) , and one must perform a spectroscopic classification .",
    "the characteristic spectroscopic difference between type  ia and ibc sne is the deep absorption trough at 6140   in ia spectra , which is due to the blueshifted @xmath5   feature .",
    "unfortunately this is redshifted out of the optical passband for @xmath6 , making classification of type  i sne difficult .",
    "alternative spectral discriminants between ia and ibc sne are @xmath7 ( e.g. coil et  al .",
    "2000 ) , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic identifications are made using template - matching , but no statistical information is given about misidentifications with this method @xcite .",
    "assuming the same relative ia and ibc rates in nearby sne samples , riess  et .",
    "al  ( 2004 ) and barris  et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) reasoned that the rate of contamination from type  ibc sn in high redshift samples should be less than @xmath10% .",
    "however , the star formation rate increases rapidly at up to @xmath11 , and this is likely to have a significant effect on the relative rates of sn types . as",
    "type  ibc sne come from massive stars ( m  @xmath12  m@xmath13 ) , their rate depends on the star formation rate in the previous 10  myr .",
    "it is well established that the global star formation rate increases at higher redshifts .",
    "hence , assuming a delay for ia explosions , we expect that the rate of type  ibc sne increases over the short term , and that the contribution from ibc sne becomes more important at higher redshift .",
    "motivated by this , we investigate here what effect contamination by type  ibc sne has on cosmological parameters derived from ia sne samples . the optimal way to determine the systematic effect in a particular survey is through simulations using the diagnostic machinery associated with said survey .",
    "however , the general nature of the effect can be investigated robustly with simulations such as the one we present here .",
    "the global star formation rate peaked somewhere between @xmath14 and has been declining to the present day @xcite . between the local universe and z@xmath15 ,",
    "the star formation rate increased to @xmath16 times the rate in the current epoch .",
    "this significant increase in star formation rate should have a substantial effect on the relative rates of sn types .",
    "if the rates are about 1 type  ibc sn for every 9 of type  ia , when the star formation rate was 10 times its present value , the rates of type  ibc and ia sn should be about equal ; for higher star formation rates , type  ibc sn will outnumber those of type  ia .",
    "here we assume that the rate of type  ibc sn explosions does not evolve with metallicity , therefore it depends only on the number of massive stars formed in the last @xmath17  myr , and thus scales linearly with the recent star formation rate .",
    "we also assume that the rate of type  ia sn should be relatively constant after the `` time delay '' until the first explosion , which is somewhat speculative .",
    "it is possible that the rate of type  ia sne correlates with the star formation rate to some degree , but in any case to a lesser degree than the core - collapse type  ibc sne . whatever the actual degree , an increase in the global star formation rate will affect the relative ratio of type ia to ibc sne observed at that epoch , which leads us to the present investigation .",
    "important constraints on the time delay for sne  ia explosion are now being extracted from intermediate redshift sne samples @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that the general conclusions presented here _ do not depend _ on the type  ia vs. ibc rate with star formation rate , only that an increasing ibc / ia rate with redshift provided the motivation for this study .",
    "]    ]    we use the observed distribution of uncorrected absolute magnitudes , from the @xcite study of the asiago supernova catalog .",
    "pertinent here are the 111 type  ia sn , 5 luminous type  ibc sn , and 13 `` normal '' type  ibc sn in the catalog .",
    "we will use their single gaussian fit to the _ uncorrected _ absolute magnitudes of the 111 type  ia sn ( @xmath18 ) and their single gaussian fit to the type  ibc sne ( @xmath19 ) ; these are shown in figure  [ mag1 ] .",
    "the number of type  ibc sne in the sample is small enough that a two - component model for the distribution of magnitudes is equally valid , with @xmath20 ; @xmath21 , and a weight@xmath22 .",
    "we run models with both the one and two gaussian distributions for ibc magnitudes .",
    "we use a monte carlo simulation that creates a random redshift array from @xmath23 .",
    "absolute magnitudes are assigned from the type ia and ibc absolute magnitude distributions ( described in the preceding section ) .",
    "we then include `` observational scatter '' by adding or subtracting flux from each object according to a gaussian distribution with @xmath24 magnitudes .",
    "this is slightly larger than the mean error of sne between @xmath25 in the @xcite sample ( 32 objects , mean error@xmath26 ) .",
    "we `` observe '' objects by calculating the luminosity distance for each object at its individual redshift , and `` detecting '' those with absolute magnitudes brighter than the detection limit , which we take as @xmath27 .",
    "this should be roughly correct for redshifts up to @xmath28 . beyond this",
    ", rest - frame @xmath29 corresponds most closely to @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a more realistic limit .",
    "however , including this effect does not significantly affect the results in what follows .",
    "the type ia sne that are `` detected '' are re - sampled to a gaussian distribution with a center at what we take as the corrected type ia sne absolute magnitude ( -19.41 ; leibundgut 2001 ) , but with the dispersion equal to quadrature addition of the corrected dispersion of a typical low - redshift sne sample ( 0.14 ; barris et  al . 2004 ) and an additional observational scatter .",
    "this simulates the corrections made to the type ia absolute magnitudes based on light curve width and color , but with a larger scatter to simulate observational error .",
    "distance moduli are calculated for each object by assuming each has the absolute magnitude of a corrected type  ia sn .",
    "then the difference between these distance moduli and the distance moduli for an empty universe is calculated .",
    "high redshift supernovae surveys utilize an analysis method based on the multiwavelength or multicolor light - curve shape method @xcite .",
    "this method uses a set of ia lightcurves as templates for training , then concurrently fits the distance modulus , extinction , typically expressed in units of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , a parameter which describes the lightcurve shape and corresponds to the difference in absolute magnitude of the sn and a fiducial sn ia .",
    "the dominant correction comes from the correlation between light curve shape and peak magnitude , in the sense that fainter ia sne decline in luminosity faster than brighter ones . in order to discuss this quantitatively",
    ", we consider here the decline parameter , @xmath34 , which is the difference between the peak magnitude and the magnitude at 15 days after maximum ( e.g. phillips 1993 ) .",
    "the decline parameter varies with the observed restframe wavelength , and depends on k - corrections , extinction , and redshift ( time dilation ) @xcite .",
    "the goal here is not to reproduce a particular survey and its associated completeness and bias , but to investigate any possible systematic effect a contaminated sne sample has on the derived cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore , in this study we assume that the corrections ( k , extinction , and time dilation ) are accurately performed and the errors associated with these corrections are contained in the observational scatter parameter .",
    "to estimate typical modifications to ibc magnitudes , we use the relation from @xcite for the b - band , @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 , and we set @xmath37 to the value we use for corrected peak ia magnitudes , -19.41 .",
    "we stress that the particular values for @xmath38 , dispersions , etc . that we use are not significant , only that we consistently use the same values throughout the simulation .",
    "then we need typical decline parameters for ibc sne .",
    "most published lightcurves for ib and ic sne are not well - sampled in the period @xmath39 days from maximum , but focus on the long - term behavior of the lightcurve .",
    "we have collected a sample of 5 ibc lightcurves with measurable @xmath34 ; these are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we also note that we have not listed the ib sn  1983n @xcite and ic sn  1983v @xcite that have been shown to have similar lightcurves to sn  1993j , although the number of photometric points in the first @xmath39 days is small .",
    "decline parameters for these 5 ibc sne span a wide range of values . in light of this",
    ", we select reasonable ranges for the decline parameter considering the sample of ia sne presented in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this is valid even if decline parameters for ibc sne are distributed differently than ia decline parameters , as ibc sne that are not weeded out will be fit to ia templates . we explore four treatments assuming : ( 1 ) no modifications , ( 2 ) all ibc sne are matched to templates with small decline parameters ( mean=0.9 , dispersion=0.1 ) , ( 3 ) all ibc sne are matched to templates with large decline parameters ( mean=1.5 , dispersion=0.3 ) , and ( 4 ) ibc sne are matched with decline parameters with a mean of 1.1 and a gaussian dispersion of 0.3 .",

    "the answer to this question is best left to survey designers .",
    "as the progenitors of type ibc sne are massive stars , we can expect that the majority have higher extinctions than ia sne and occur in gas - rich galaxies .",

    "for ibc contamination to be a significant concern , @xmath105% of these _ bright _ ibc sne must fail to be rejected through the possible combinations of light curve fitting , spectral - typing , host galaxy morphology , and extinction .",

    "we find that even small contamination fractions ( 5% ) may bias the measurement of @xmath71 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , we have also illustrated the ease with which ibc sne can be identified when the observational error and the dispersion about the corrected ia peak magnitudes is low .",
    "based on the calculations presented here , the straightforward effect of contamination from type  ibc sn in intermediate - to - high redshift sn samples is to reduce the @xmath56 goodness - of - fit to the true cosmological parameters .",
    "this manifests itself as an increase in the minimum value of the reduced @xmath56 grid . for a flat universe with @xmath106 even small numbers ( 5% ) of type",
    "ibc sne may push both values upwards .",
    "erroneously small `` probability '' curves can be generated by assuming the model is a good fit and that the minimum reduced @xmath56 is close enough to 1 for a meaningful conversion to a probability grid .",
    "however , if the observational errors are large , it is difficult to distinguish between a minimum reduced @xmath56 that is larger due to a mismatch of the model and the observations due to contamination or from simple stochastic effects .    if the observational errors are large enough ( @xmath107 ) , then a small contamination fraction ( 5% ) by ibc sne can shift the location of the @xmath56 minimum without making @xmath56 itself large .",
    "in such a case the error contours will be large , so while the contours are not strictly statistically correct , they are still meaningful in the sense that the underlying cosmological parameters have close to a 99% chance of being within the @xmath68 contours",
    ". if the observational error approaches the scatter in the corrected standard candle ia magnitudes , the errors bars will shrink .",
    "however , with the same amount of ibc contamination , as the observational error steadily decreases , the reduced @xmath56 becomes steadily greater than 1 .",
    "then the conversion from a @xmath56 grid to probabilities is not valid .",
    "one may assume that the random errors are underestimated and renormalize ; the error contours may then become large enough to encompass the underlying @xmath108 values .",
    "but if this precision is achieved , outliers should already be readily discriminated in the @xmath99 vs. @xmath109 plane , and a simple @xmath110 clipping routine may suffice . simply having large numbers of sne with the precision of current surveys",
    "would also allow one to use @xmath70-clipping to remove ibc outliers , however , this will not achieve significantly greater precision in the measurement of cosmological parameters .    the author is pleased to acknowledge the anonymous referee for comments and suggestions which improved the content of the paper .",
    "thank you to t. matheson for providing lightcurve data and reference pointers for ib / c sne , and a. riess for useful comments on how sn typing is performed .",
