    "inspired by two source , namely , the theory of multiple zeta values on the one hand , and the theory of modular symbols and periods of cusp forms on the other , manin in @xcite , @xcite extended the theory of periods of modular forms replacing integration along geodesics in the complex upper half plane by iterated integrations to set up the foundation of the theory of `` iterated noncommutative modular symbols '' .",
    "in particular manin@xcite considered the following iterated mellin transform @xmath0 of a finite sequence of cusp forms @xmath1 of weight @xmath2 with respect to a congruence subgroup @xmath3 of @xmath4 and @xmath5 when @xmath6 then @xmath7 is the classical mellin transform of a cusp form @xmath8 satisfying the following functional equation :    @xmath9 if @xmath10 is an eigenform with eigenvalue @xmath11 with respect to the involution @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however it seems that it is not anymore true to expect a simple functional equation if @xmath13 manin @xcite said `` since a neat functional equation can be written not for these individual integrals but for their generating series .. , '' so the functional equation of the `` total mellin transform '' associated to the finite family @xmath14 of cusp forms was derived . + now consider the case when @xmath15 : for @xmath16 , we have    @xmath17 @xmath18 if @xmath19 is a positive integer , then @xmath20 is a finite linear combination of the following multiple dirichlet series:@xmath21 where @xmath22 whose real part is sufficiently large .    in this paper",
    "we study more general type of multiple dirichlet series , motivated by the above iterated mellin transform of manin .",
    "take @xmath23 be a sequence of complex numbers , and define @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) be two complex variables .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to prove two types of functional equations for this double series .",
    "this is more general situation since we take @xmath27 be an arbitrary complex number and allow @xmath28 for any @xmath29    before stating our main results , we recall functional equations for classical zeta - functions , and for the double zeta - function without coefficients .",
    "it is well - known that the riemann zeta - function @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) has the beautiful symmetric functional equation @xmath32 for hurwitz zeta - functions @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , however , this symmetricity is no longer valid in general .",
    "in fact , the functional equation for @xmath35 is of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lerch zeta - function ( titchmarsh ( * ? ? ? * ( 2.17.3 ) ) ) .",
    "see also a recent work of lagarias and li @xcite .",
    "those functional equations are very fundamental in the study of @xmath30 and @xmath35 .",
    "the theory of multiple zeta - functions has been studied very actively in recent decades .",
    "searching for some kind of functional equations is a quite natural problem in order to develop further analytic studies of multiple zeta - functions . in the simplest double zeta case ,",
    "the following functional equation is already known : consider the case @xmath38 in the definition , that is @xmath39 this is called the euler double zeta - function , and satisfies the following functional equation : @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( the confluent hypergeometric function ) , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .    formula may be regarded as a double analogue of . in fact , since the asymptotic expansion @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the remainder term ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula 6.13.1(1 ) ) ) is known , taking the first term of the right - hand side of , we can `` approximate '' @xmath50 by the dirichlet series @xmath51 .",
    "therefore @xmath50 is a kind of `` generalized dirichlet series '' .",
    "moreover , gives a symmetric form of functional equation , similar to , on some hyperplanes ( see remark [ rmk - symm ] at the end of section [ sec-4 ] ) .",
    "formula was essentially included in @xcite , and first explicitly stated in @xcite ( in a generalized form with certain shifting parameters ) . in @xcite a generalization of formula to the case where the denominator includes certain complex parameters .",
    "moreover in @xcite a formula analogous to was shown for double @xmath52-functions whose numerator includes dirichlet characters .    the purpose of the present paper is to discuss such kind of functional equations in a more general setting . as a consequence we are able to determine trivial zero divisors of double series .",
    "we will state the main results in the next section .",
    "our first main result in the present paper is a further generalization of formula .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 be a sequence of complex numbers satisfying +    1 .",
    "@xmath53 with a certain constant @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an arbitrarily small positive number , 2 .",
    "the dirichlet series @xmath56 ( which is absolutely convergent for @xmath57 by ( i ) ) can be continued to the whole complex plane as a meromorphic function which has only finitely many poles .",
    "let @xmath58 be the complex upper half plane and let @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "it is obvious by ( i ) that @xmath61 is convergent for @xmath62 and holomorphic in @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , using ( i ) we find that the right - hand side of is @xmath64 so , using ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3 ) , we see that is convergent absolutely in the region @xmath65 under ussumption ( ii ) , using @xcite we can show that has meromorphic continuation to the whole complex space @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 and @xmath68 also put @xmath69    [ thm-1 ] ( the first form of the functional equation ) under the above assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) , the functions @xmath70 can be continued meromorphically to the whole space @xmath66 , and for any @xmath71 , except for singularity points , it holds that @xmath72    we can determine the location of singular locus of @xmath73 from the right - hand side of .",
    "in fact , the explicit form of @xmath74 is given by , while the explicit information on the singular locus of @xmath75 can be obtained from and in section [ sec-4 ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm-1 ] , which will be described in sections [ sec-1 ] to [ sec-4 ] , is analogous to that in @xcite , the basic idea of which goes back to motohashi @xcite and katsurada and matsumoto @xcite .",
    "since the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) for @xmath76 is very general , we may discuss various specific examples .",
    "for instance , by replacing @xmath77 by @xmath78 in ( [ thm-1 ] ) we recover the functional equation ( [ 0-double - fe ] ) of double zeta function .",
    "further let us consider the very special situation that @xmath79 in this case ( [ thm-1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath80 a single series in two variables .",
    "this is a special case of the series @xmath81 which was used in @xcite . from the above theorem",
    "we immediately obtain the following `` two - variables analogue '' of .",
    "[ cor ] for any @xmath71 , except for singularity points , it holds that @xmath82 where @xmath83    it is to be noted that @xmath84 therefore , multiplying the both sides of by @xmath85 and adding with respect to @xmath86 , we obtain . from this observation",
    "we may say that corollary [ cor ] is a `` refinement '' or `` decomposition '' of theorem [ thm-1 ] .",
    "another important example , closely related with our original motivation on periods , is the case that @xmath76 is the set of fourier coefficients of a certain cusp form .",
    "now assume that is a holomorphic cusp form of weight @xmath87 with respect to the hecke congruence subgroup @xmath88 .",
    "in this case the assumptios ( i ) and ( ii ) are surely satisfied ; ( i ) is deligne s estimate and @xmath87 is the weight . in this case",
    "we write @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath89 and @xmath70 by @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "then can be written as @xmath94 since this formula is proved under the above very general setting , no property of cusp form is used in the proof . when @xmath10 is a cusp form , it is natural to expect some different type of results , for which the modularity is essestially used .",
    "our second main result gives such a functional equation .",
    "let @xmath95 this @xmath96 is again a cusp form of weight @xmath87 with respect to @xmath88 , and especially @xmath97 when @xmath98 .",
    "we write the fourier expansion of @xmath96 at @xmath99 as @xmath100 .",

    "recall that an important application of the classical functional equation is that from which we can find the `` trivial zeros '' at negative even integer points of @xmath30 .",
    "the above theorem [ thm-2 ] has the same type of application .",
    "in fact , as we will see in section [ sec-7 ] , we can show the following    [ cor-2 ] for any non - negative integer @xmath104 , the hyperplane @xmath105 is a zero - divisor of @xmath90 .",
    "note that this corollary can not be deduced from theorem [ thm-1 ] .",
    "these zero - divisors may be regarded as `` trivial zeros '' of @xmath90 .",
    "[ rem1.5 ] it is to be noted that , when @xmath61 is a cusp form , @xmath91 also satisfies a functional equation .",
    "let @xmath106 then from the functional equation for @xmath92 ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "now we assume ( i ) and ( ii ) in the introduction and start the proof of theorem [ thm-1 ] . in this section",
    "we prove the following integral expression of @xmath73 .",

    "then the right - hand side tends to @xmath121 while the left - hand side of tends to @xmath122 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "the integrand of the inner integral of the right - hand side of is singular at @xmath123 .",
    "the next step is to `` separate '' the contribution of this singularity .",
