    "the determination of the elemental abundances of cosmic rays ( crs ) observed in the solar system provides valuable information on the nature of their sources , acceleration mechanisms and propagation in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . while there is a general consensus for supernova shocks being the main acceleration sites of cr particles with energy per nucleon up to @xmath4 ev , still unresolved is the question of which are their sources .    from measurements of the abundances made near the earth it is possible , by modelling the propagation processes in the ism , to infer the elemental abundances at cr sources as well as to place constraints on the nature of their original environments",
    "the present data can not select one model between coronal material of later - type stars ( which are rich of ions in a gas - phase ) and interstellar medium in the proximity of supernovae remnants .",
    "two proposed cr selection mechanisms based on the elemental first ionization potential ( fip ) and on the volatility / refractory state , _",
    "i.e. _ on the condensation temperature @xmath5 , could justify the first scenario with respect to the second .",
    "the measured cr abundances show a strong prevalence of the refractory elements ( which are generally characterized by low fip and large @xmath5 , e.g. mg ( @xmath6 ) , ca ( @xmath7 ) , fe ( @xmath8 ) @xcite ) with respect to the volatile ones ( characterized by high fip and small @xmath5 , e.g. h ( @xmath9 ) , he ( @xmath10 ) , o ( @xmath11 ) ) .",
    "the apparent anti - correlation between fip and @xmath5 prevents to choose between the two mechanisms .",
    "such degeneracy could be solved by measuring the abundances of the few volatile low - fip elements and the rare refractory with high - fip ones @xcite ; e.g. ga ( @xmath12 ) , ge ( @xmath13 ) , rb ( @xmath14 ) , pb ( @xmath15 ) , bi ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "a number of signatures exists in the abundance spectrum of heavy nuclei ( @xmath17 ) @xcite ; in order to reach confident conclusions it is necessary to achieve high - resolution charge measurements and high statistics . elements with @xmath18 are rare and large exposure factors ( collecting area @xmath19 exposure time @xmath19 angular acceptance ) are required .",
    "for example the abundances of @xmath20 nuclei is 1000@xmath2110000 times smaller than fe nuclei , whose flux is @xmath21 @xmath22sr@xmath23day@xmath23 .    since many years high altitude balloon flights provided an alternative to more expensive ( even in terms of realization time ) satellite based experiments .",
    "flight durations have been growing from few days to several weeks on recent long duration balloons ( ldb ) flown from antartic regions e.g. @xcite , and plans are underway to provide missions up to months ( ultra ldb ) .",
    "plastic passive detectors are promising since they can provide good charge resolution , and are certainly suitable for balloon flights , as they can be used in large collecting areas and limited weight .",
    "the main limitation is that the detector has to be recovered after the flight for the analysis with microscopes .",
    "such type of technique was already used succesfully in several experiments on balloons [ 4 - 6 ] and in space [ 7 - 10 ] nuclear track detectors ( ntds ) like cr39@xmath1 can detect charged particles with @xmath24 with very good charge resolution @xcite , whereas lexan@xmath1/makrofol@xmath1 polycarbonates have higher thresholds , @xmath25 @xcite . due to the large flux of low charged particles the analysis of cr39@xmath1 detectors and the determination of the relative abundances",
    "can be time consuming . thus the necessity to develop an automatic system for reading and measuring the track characteristics .",
    "the purpose of the cake balloon experiment from the asi ( _ agenzia spaziale italiana _ ) was to test the implementation of new scanning and analysis techniques for future ldb flights of large area detectors ( tens of m@xmath3sr ) @xcite .",
    "we report here about the scanning procedures and algorithms developed to analyse the cr39@xmath1 sheets exposed during a trans - mediterranean flight . the obtained primary charge spectrum at the top of the atmosphere is presented .",
    "cake was composed of 80 multilayer stacks of cr39@xmath1 and lexan@xmath1 sheets .",
    "each \" standard  stack was of dimension 11.5@xmath1911.5 cm@xmath3 , with 10 sheets of lexan@xmath1 , 0.25 mm thick , sandwiched between 20 layers of cr39@xmath1 , 0.7 or 1.4 mm thick .",
    "ten stacks were also assembled with al or pb foils to study the fragmentation of the impinging particles .",
    "each al or pb foil was 0.5 mm thick .",
    "the thickness of a standard stack was @xmath22.3 g / cm@xmath3 while it was @xmath2 3.0 and 4.8 g / cm@xmath3 for a stack with al and pb targets , respectively .",
    "five stacks were inserted into an aluminium cylinder , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : cilinder ] , and four cylinders were loadged into aluminium `` boxes '' with an internal insulation foam coverage .",
    "the entire experimental set - up composed of four `` boxes '' was lodged on the payload of a stratospheric balloon .",
    "the cylinders and the boxes were designed to preserve the sheets in an air environment at normal preassure during the flight .",
    "the full exposed area was @xmath21 m@xmath3 .",
    "the balloon was launched from the trapani - milo base ( 12.5@xmath27e 32.92@xmath27n ) of asi and landed in central spain after 22 hours of flight .",
    "the plafond altitude was 37@xmath2140 km ( 3@xmath213.5 g @xmath22 ) and was kept for about 17.8 hours .",
    "along the balloon trajectory the mean vertical rigidity cut - off was @xmath27 gv ( limiting the minimum energy of the impinging crs to e@xmath02.6 gev / nucleon ) @xcite .",
    "the gondola was not azimuthally controlled and thus no east - west effect could be searched for .    during the balloon flight the cylinders had an internal preassure of 1 atm , and",
    "the inside temperature never exceeded @xmath28 .",
    "studies performed in a controlled heating room , determined that cr39@xmath1 keeps its sensitivity unchanged from @xmath29 up to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "after the flight cr39@xmath1 sheets of standard stacks were etched in a 6n naoh solution at ( 70@xmath310.1)@xmath27c for 30 hours ; the total number of detector foils that were chemically etched was @xmath2280 .",
    "the detectors were measured by an automated samaica ( scanning and measuring with automatic image contour analysis ) image analyzer , _ i.e. _ an integrated daq system composed of an optical microscope controlled by a personal computer , a built in frame grabber , and a positioning stage @xcite ; the image analyzer was a product of elbek - bildanalyse gmbh ; see fig .

    "the surface base of the etch - pits has an elliptical shape .",
    "for each exposed stack four cr39@xmath1 detector plates were measured in automatic mode . for each etch - pit",

    "the scanned area of each foil was reduced to 8@xmath198 cm@xmath3 to avoid edge effects ; a single detector sheet was measured in @xmath212 hours .    by determining the cr39@xmath1 bulk etching rate @xmath32 @xcite it was possible to compute the reduced etching rate @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the etching velocity along the particle trajectory .",
    "exposures of cr39@xmath1 stacks to relativistic heavy ion beams at accelerators @xcite allowed a correlation of the measured @xmath35 with the charge number @xmath36 of the impinging ions @xcite .",
    "we had at our disposal three cr39@xmath1 calibrations for three different @xmath32 values , namely 1.1 , 1.15 , and 1.21 @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the interval @xmath38 was used for accepting the bulk velocity of the etched foils .",
    "236 out of 280 detectors were selected and analyzed .",
    "the parameters for the automatic measurement of the detectors were set to obtain a minimum bias in the track measurement ; the residual noise was treated off line with the implementation of an appropiated filter .",
    "the scan efficiency was @xmath3990% for the detection of tracks from nuclei with charges @xmath40 9 @xcite .",
    "a filter was implemented in order to classify the measured tracks using a multilayer perceptron neural network @xcite trained on a data sample of @xmath23000 cosmic ray tracks measured manually .",
    "the filter selection is based on two features of the measured tracks : the track ellipticity ( defined as the ratio of the minor to major semi axes of the base etch - pit ) and its central brightness ( a quantity measured in arbitrary units by the optical system ) .",
    "the filtered data set are @xmath4160% of the raw data set @xcite .",
    "semi - automatic scans were made by operators to check the goodness of the automatic measurements and the filter ; for each track it was verified if it was passing through both sides of the detector foil .",

    "only tracks crossing the plates in linear trajectory were selected ( cosmic ray particles with energies @xmath42 gev / nucleon are highly penetrating and scattering is negligible ) . a cosmic ray `` event '' was defined as a track passing through at least three consecutive detector plates as shown by the trajectory on the left in fig .",
    "[ pic:3of4 ] .",
    "each candidate event was tracked individually by means of the _ fiducial area recursive method _",

    "the geometrical acceptance of the c39 detectors varies with the charge z @xcite as there is a limiting angle @xmath52 for the formation and observation of a track in the detectors @xmath53 by including the exponential attenuation of crs ( i.e. by considering the residual atmosphere , the al containers of the detectors and the insulating foam which filled the vessels ) the geometrical factor of the detector varies as shown in fig .",

    "@xcite at a similar energy threshold ( 2.6 gev / nucleon ) .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory for @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 there is a disagreement due to the filter and algorithm rejecting small tracks affecting mainly low charged particles .",
    "the differences at the left of the fe peak are probably due to a partially unsatisfactory correction for fragmentation . at the right of the fe peak",

    "this paper was focused on the development of automatic analysis procedures for determining the chemical composition of cosmic ray nuclei using nuclear track detectors .",
    "the ntd technique offers good charge resolution and is attractive for the exploration / determination of the charge spectrum of cosmic particles at reasonable cost .",
    "the explotation of this technique in large area experiments relies on automatic image analyzers for scanning and measuring the detector foils as well as on the availability of ldb and uldb flights .    by making use of a short stratospheric balloon flight we had the opportunity to study and develop several tools to obtain a charge spectrum of cosmic ray particles with @xmath57 at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "our measurement is in fair agreement with other observations .",
