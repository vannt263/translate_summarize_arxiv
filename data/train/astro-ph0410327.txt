    "in a stellar cluster , if the velocity dispersion is smaller than about 300kms@xmath1 , the collision cross section is dominated by gravitational focusing . under these conditions the ( local ) collision time , i.e. , the average time after which all stars have experienced one collision , is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the stellar density , @xmath5 the 1d velocity dispersion , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the typical values of the radius and the mass of a star , respectively .",
    "in view of this relation , one may think that direct collisions never play a role in cluster dynamics unless they are mediated by binary interactions , in which case the cross section is larger by a factor @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the typical binary separation .",
    "the role of binaries in cluster dynamics is presented by fregeau , mcmillan and portegies - zwart in these proceedings .",
    "in contrast , here we focus on two cases in which the collisions between single stars are likely to play an important role : ( 1 ) fast core collapse followed by runaway collisions in young dense clusters and ( 2 ) stellar dynamics in the vicinity of a massive black hole ( mbh ) at the center of a galaxy . in case ( 1 ) , if there are no primordial binaries , the merger sequence is likely to start before the first binary forms dynamically through 3-body interactions @xcite ; furthermore , primordial binaries probably foster collisions rather than preventing them by stalling the core collapse . in case ( 2 ) , interaction rate peaks in the most central parts where densities exceed @xmath10 .",
    "however , at this location owing to the mbh s presence , the velocity dispersion is also very high ; as a result , most binaries are soft and should be dynamically dissociated .    to simulate the evolution of stellar clusters containing a large number of stars over time scales comparable to the relaxation ( or collision ) time , we use two monte carlo ( mc ) codes based on the pioneering ideas of @xcite .",
    "these codes are described in detail in the literature @xcite .",
    "the mc method assumes that the cluster is spherical , in dynamical equilibrium and that 2-body relaxation can be treated in the fokker - planck approximation .",
    "the cluster is represented as a set of spherical shells ( `` particles '' ) each of which may stand for a single star or a fixed number of stars which share the same orbital and stellar properties .",
    "typical particle numbers used in the simulations range between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the stellar orbital motion is not followed explicitly ; instead one tracks the long - term evolution of orbits ( and stellar properties ) subject to relaxation , direct stellar collisions , stellar evolution and possibly interactions with a central mbh . even though the effect of binaries may be accounted for in the mc method @xcite , here we consider only single stars .",
    "various prescriptions can be used for the outcome of stellar collisions , ranging from sticky spheres to inter / extrapolation from a large database of sph simulation results @xcite .",
    "we consider the evolution of young stellar clusters with a broad initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "for all results presented here , we used the salpeter imf , @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "there is no initial mass segregation .",
    "we first studied the relaxation - driven core collapse to determine the conditions for it to occur while the most massive stars are still on the main sequence ( ms ) , i.e. within @xmath16myr @xcite .",
    "this condition arises because the mass loss during the giant phase and the subsequent supernova explosions would stop the core collapse and cause the cluster to expand .",
    "a key finding of our work is that , for a given cluster structure and a `` reasonable '' imf ( neither too flat or too steep ) , the core collapse time , @xmath17 , is simply proportional to the initial central relaxation time , where the proportionality constant depends on the ratio of the maximum to the average stellar mass , @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath20 , a regime reached by all realistic imf , the dependency flattens to a constant value : @xmath21 , independently of the cluster structure . with this",
    "we can predict that in any cluster with @xmath22myr , massive stars will form a dense collapsing core before they turn into remnants and should start colliding with each other .",
    "this condition for quick core collapse is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrplane ] .",
    "we see that , if clusters are born with relatively high concentration , a significant fraction of them lie in the proper region of parameter space .",
    "more recently we have explicitly considered the effects of collisions in a series of mc simulations @xcite . as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : mrplane ] , quick core collapse , followed by the runaway growth of a vms through repeated mergers , happened in all cases for which we predicted @xmath23myr , except when the number of particles is too low to have a critical number of massive stars initially present in the core . for clusters with large masses and small sizes ,",
    "collisions themselves shorten the effective @xmath17 and we obtained runaway growth for larger clusters than predicted from the simple relaxational core collapse picture .",
    "figures  [ fig : trees ] , [ fig : masses ] and [ fig : tscales ] present a detailed look at the runaway sequences obtained in two simulations . in these cases we used the sticky sphere approximation which we checked to be fully justified when @xmath24kms@xmath1 .",
    "we note that , in most situations , a very important fraction of the mass accumulated in the vms comes from the upper - most part of the imf , @xmath25 , due to strong mass segregation .",
    "another important finding is that , generally , the interval between mergers is much shorter than the thermal time scale of the vms .",
    "consequently , its structure is probably more extended and diffuse than a ms star , contrary to our assumption .",
    "average growth rates are typically higher than @xmath26 .",
    "our results raise a number of open questions . one important planned extension of this work is to establish the role of primordial binaries .",
    "most other uncertainties are connected with the final mass of the vms and its fate .",
    "the vast majority of our simulations were artificially terminated when the vms reached some high mass ( typically @xmath27 ) while the average time between mergers was still much shorter than the remaining ms lifetime .",
    "we think that , although they include collisional mass loss , our models lack the physics limiting the growth of the vms .",
    "preliminary models assuming a fixed central vms but accounting for depletion of `` loss - cone '' orbits show a saturation at a few @xmath28 .",
    "another limiting mechanism may be that the vms can not radiate collision energy and swells until it becomes `` transparent '' to impacting stars . whether the vms will spawn an intermediate - mass bh is also uncertain because , once collisional growth levels off , strong stellar winds or pulsational instabilities may strongly reduce the vms mass , unless the metallicity is very low .",
    "finally we note that since the process occurs on a myr time scale , it should be considered in the context of cluster formation , with account for the residual gas and pre - ms stars .",
    "the situation is completely different in galactic nuclei harboring a central mbh . inside the radius of influence of the mbh",
    ", the stellar density probably follows a power - law cusp @xmath29 with @xmath30 and the velocity dispersion raises like @xmath31 . hence , @xmath32 and collisions should be effective very close to the mbh .",
    "but there the relative velocities are so high that partial or complete disruptions are more likely than mergers .",
    "even a short sequence of mergers was never found in older mc galactic nucleus simulations such as shown in fig .  [ fig : galnuc ] ."
