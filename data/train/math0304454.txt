    "_ hyperbolic _ flows , such as geodesic flows on compact manifolds of negative curvature , the asymptotic behaviour of ergodic integrals is described by the _ central limit theorem _ ( y. sinai , m. ratner ) .",
    "in these cases , the dynamical system can be described as an approximation of a ` random ' stochastic process , like the outcomes of flipping a coin .",
    "non - hyperbolic systems as not as well understood , with the important exception of toral flows . for generic non - singular area - preserving flows on the @xmath1-torus logarithmic bounds on ergodic integrals of zero - average functions of bounded variation can be derived by the _ denjoy - koksma inequality _ and the theory of continued fractions . for a general ergodic flow ,",
    "ergodic integrals are bounded for all times for a special class of functions : _ coboundaries _ with bounded ` transfer ' functions ( gottschalk - hedlund ) . in the hyperbolic examples and in the case of generic toral flows ,",
    "a smooth function is a coboundary if and only if it has zero average with respect to all invariant measures .    in this article",
    ", we are interested in flows with _ parabolic _ behaviour .",
    "following a. katok , a dynamical system is called parabolic if the rate of divergence of nearby orbits is at most polynomial in time , while hyperbolic systems are characterized by exponential divergence .",
    "toral flows are a rather special parabolic example , called _ elliptic _ , since there is no divergence of orbits . it has been known for many years that typical examples of parabolic flows , such as horocycle flows or generic nilpotent flows are _ uniquely ergodic _ , but until recently not much was known on the asymptotic behaviour of ergodic averages , with the exception of some polynomial bounds on the speed of convergence in the horocycle case ( m. ratner , m. burger ) , related to the polynomial rate of mixing .",
    "we have been able to prove , in collaboration with l. flaminio , that for many examples of parabolic dynamics the behaviour of ergodic averages is typically described as follows .    a smooth flow @xmath2 on a finite dimensional manifold @xmath3 has _ deviation spectrum _",

    "zorich discovered in numerical experiments on interval exchange transformations an unexpected new phenomenon @xcite .",
    "he found that , although a generic flow on a surface of genus @xmath14 is uniquely ergodic ( h. masur , w. veech ) , for large times the homology classes of return orbits exhibit unbounded polynomial deviations with exponents @xmath15 from the line spanned in the homology group by the _ schwartzmann s asymptotic cycle_. in his later work @xcite , @xcite and in joint work with m. kontsevich @xcite , zorich was able to explain this phenomenon in terms of conjectures on the lyapunov exponents of the teichmller flow on moduli spaces of holomorphic differentials on riemann surfaces .",
    "kontsevich and zorich also conjectured that zorich s phenomenon is not merely topological , but it extends to ergodic integrals of smooth functions .",
    "`` there is , presumably , an equivalent way of describing the numbers @xmath16 .",
    "namely , let @xmath17 be a smooth function ... then for a generic trajectory @xmath18 , we expect that the number @xmath19 for large @xmath20 with high probability has size @xmath21 for some @xmath22 .",
    "the exponent @xmath23 appears for all functions with non - zero average value .",
    "the next exponent , @xmath24 , should work for functions in a codimension @xmath25 subspace of @xmath26 , etc . ''",
    "@xcite    around the same time , we proved that for a generic non - exact hamiltonian flow @xmath2 on a higher genus surface not all smooth zero average functions are smooth coboundaries @xcite .",
    "in fact , we found that , in contrast with the hyperbolic case and the elliptic case of toral flows , there are @xmath7-invariant distributional obstructions , which are not signed measures , to the existence of smooth solutions of the _ cohomological equation",
    "_ @xmath27 .",
    "this result suggested that zorich s phenomenon should be related to the presence of invariant distributions other than the ( unique ) invariant probability measure .",
    "in fact , in @xcite we were able prove the kontsevich - zorich conjectures that the deviation exponents are non - zero and that generic non - exact hamiltonian flows on higher genus surfaces have a deviation spectrum .",
    "recently , in collaboration with l. flaminio , we have proved that other classical parabolic examples , such as horocycle flows on compact surfaces of constant negative curvature @xcite and generic nilpotent flows on compact @xmath0-dimensional nilmanifolds @xcite , do have a deviation spectrum , but of countable multiplicity , in contrast with the case of flows on surfaces which have spectrum of finite multiplicity equal to the genus .",
    "we will outline below a general framework , derived mostly from @xcite and successfully carried out in @xcite , @xcite , for proving that a flow on a _ pseudo - homogeneous space _ has a deviation spectrum .",
    "our framework is based on the construction of an appropriate _ renormalization dynamics _ on a moduli space of pseudo - homogeneous structures , which generalizes the teichmller flow .",
    "renormalizable flow _ for which the space of smooth functions is _ stable _ ( in the sense of a. katok ) , has a deviation spectrum determined by the lyapunov exponents of a _ renormalization cocycle _ over a bundle of _ basic currents_. pseudo - homogeneous spaces are a generalization of homogeneous spaces .",
    "the motivating non - homogeneous example is given by any punctured riemann surface carrying a holomorphic differential vanishing only at the punctures .",
    "it turns out that renormalizable flows are necessarily parabolic .",
    "in fact , the class of renormalizable flows encompasses all parabolic flows which are reasonably well - understood , while not much is known for most non - renormalizable parabolic flows , such as generic geodesic flows on flat surfaces with conical singularities .",

    "<S> ten years ago a. zorich discovered , by computer experiments on interval exchange transformations , some striking new power laws for the ergodic integrals of generic non - exact hamiltonian flows on higher genus surfaces . in zorich s later work and in a joint paper authored by m. kontsevich , zorich and kontsevich were able to explain conjecturally most of zorich s discoveries by relating them to the ergodic theory of teichmller flows on moduli spaces of abelian differentials .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we outline a generalization of the kontsevich - zorich framework to a class of ` renormalizable ' flows on ` pseudo - homogeneous ' spaces . </S>",
    "<S> we construct for such flows a ` renormalization dynamics ' on an appropriate ` moduli space ' , which generalizes the teichmller flow . </S>",
    "<S> if a flow is renormalizable and the space of smooth functions is ` stable ' , in the sense that the lie derivative operator on smooth functions has closed range , the behaviour of ergodic integrals can be analyzed , at least in principle , in terms of an oseledec s decomposition for a ` renormalization cocycle ' over the bundle of ` basic currents ' for the orbit foliation of the flow .    </S>",
    "<S> this approach was suggested by the author s proof of the kontsevich - zorich conjectures and it has since been applied , in collaboration with l. flaminio , to prove that the zorich phenomenon generalizes to several classical examples of volume preserving , uniquely ergodic , parabolic flows such as horocycle flows and nilpotent flows on homogeneous @xmath0-manifolds .    </S>",
