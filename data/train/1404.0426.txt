    "the attenuation of light in the resonator mode , @xmath1 , is related to the quality factor of a circular monolithic resonator as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wavelength of measurement , and @xmath4 is the refractive index of the material at this wavelength .",
    "the value of coefficient @xmath1 is determined by both absorption and scattering in the bulk material and on the surface of the resonator .",
    "hence , @xmath1 gives a reasonable approximation of the bulk absorption if other loss mechanisms are made negligible .    whispering gallery mode ( wgm )",
    "resonators are solid state cavities that confine light in small geometrical volumes for long periods of time @xcite .",
    "these structures are promising for many applications in nonlinear optics , rf photonics , and optical technology @xcite ranging from cavity qed @xcite to kerr optical frequency comb generation @xcite .",
    "finesse of wgm resonators can exceed the finesse of the best fabry - perot resonators and the linewidth of the wgms can be as small as a few khz at room temperature @xcite .",
    "various properties of the resonators are required depending on particular applications .",
    "for example , planar on - chip integration of a microresonator calls for resonators with high enough index of refraction .",
    "the refractive index should exceed the refractive index of fused silica substrate and preferably approach refractive index of silicon nitride or silicon .",
    "low index materials , like magnesium and calcium fluoride , are not suitable for this purpose .",
    "they hinders integration of kerr frequency comb generators @xcite . in this work",
    "we demonstrate , for the first time , generation of the kerr frequency combs in sapphire resonators .",
    "those resonators have excellent mechanical properties and represent a great potential for heterogeneous integration with photonic chips .",
    "ultra - stable cavities are required for laser stabilization @xcite .",
    "the ultimate stability of a monolithic microresonator is limited by fundamental thermodynamic fluctuations existing even if the resonator is kept at constant temperature @xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity of the resonator host material is essential to reduce those fluctuations . in addition , resonators with high thermal conductivity are less sensitive to various kinds of thermal effects resulting from slow heat spread from the mode volume to the substrate @xcite . in this work",
    "we report on fabrication of a diamond resonator that has extremely high thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "tunability of wgm resonators is important in many applications .",
    "for instance , structures containing multiple interacting resonators require coincidence of the wgm frequencies belonging to different resonators @xcite .",
    "the fabrication of completely identical very high - q resonators is not practical , so the postproduction trimming as well as fast real time tuning of the resonant frequencies is required .",
    "some crystalline wgm resonators possessing electro - optic effect can be tuned electrically @xcite . however , the quality ( q ) factors of those resonators are usually not very high and do not exceed one billion .",
    "ultra - high q wgm resonators are fabricated from amorphous or centro - symmetric crystals possessing some cubic nonlinearity and zero quadratic nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "such resonators can be tuned by either strain or heat , but can not be efficiently electrically tuned .",
    "we demonstrate that crystalline quartz wgm resonators can bridge this gap .",
    "quatrz resonators can simultaneously posses very high q and be tuned electrically .",
    "we describe experimental demonstration of such resonators and discuss their properties and potential applications @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we describe our results on studies of sapphire , diamond , and quartz whispering gallery mode resonators .",
    "we have fabricated sapphire whispering gallery mode resonators ( fig .  [ fig1sapphire ] ) out of sapphire preforms and shown that pumping the resonators with continuous wave light results in generation of kerr frequency combs ( fig .",
    "[ fig2sapphire ] ) .",
    "the resonators have coupled q - factor exceeding @xmath5 at 1550  nm wavelength .",
    "strong stimulated rayleigh scattering results in splitting the wgm spectra into doublets , shown at left panel of ( fig .",
    "[ fig1sapphire ] ) .",
    "since sapphire has high enough index of refraction ( 1.74705 ordinary and 1.73924 extraordinary at 1500  nm ) and is easily machinable , it is well suited for planar integration .",

    "while it is well known that diamond has an extremely broad optical transparency window , there is little consistent experimental data on its attenuation within the window .",
    "it is relatively easy to measure transparency of fused silica because of kilometers of optical fibers fabricated from the material , however this approach is not applicable to the diamond by obvious reasons .",
    "methods of fabrication of high quality diamond crystals @xcite has resulted in the material being used in a range of novel applications from optic to quantum information @xcite .",
    "the material is attractive because of its exceptional physical and chemical properties , including high thermal conductivity , mechanical hardness , and a wide optical transparency window from vacuum ultraviolet through the infrared .",
    "the best q - factor of a monolithic diamond resonator measured at 1,550  nm , up to our knowledge , is 2.5@xmath6 @xcite , which corresponds to linear attenuation coefficient @xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "the measurements were performed with a single crystal diamond race - track resonator built on top of a silicon dioxide / silicon substrate .",
    "observations have included the splitting of relatively low q resonances due to stimulated rayleigh scattering , hence we can conclude that the experimentally measured q values are not limited by the bulk loss of the material .",
    "the scattering usually results from roughness of the surface of open microresonators .",
    "mechanical polishing allows reaching outstanding surface quality that already lead to demonstration of the highest finesse monolithic resonators ( @xmath9 , @xcite ) .",
    "we used this technique to fabricate a diamond resonator @xcite .",
    "the measured quality factor of the resonator was @xmath10 , which is two orders of magnitude larger compared with the best previous measurement .",
    "we found that in our case the measured q - factor is limited by the material loss approaching @xmath11  @xmath8 and not by surface scattering .",
    "the single - crystal diamond samples used in this experiment were synthesized with a microwave plasma - assisted chemical vapor deposition reactor operating at a frequency of 896  mhz .",
    "the sample was produced from homo - epitaxial layer grown on a @xmath12-orientated diamond surface that had been prepared using high quality polishing techniques to minimize ra ( @xmath1320 nm ) and therefore reduce the nucleation of dislocations in the epitaxial layer .",

    "diamond parts for quantum computing applications have been produced in thin layers with nitrogen impurities below 1  ppb @xcite , and it can be foreseen that using the techniques exploited in the synthesis of these layers that in the future even lower absorption bulk diamond can be produced .",
    "the fabricated resonator is shown in fig .",

    "we used a silicon prism ( refractive index @xmath16 ) to couple light in and out of the resonator modes .",
    "the ultimate coupling efficiency achieved in the experiment exceeds 70% .",
    "a tunable fiber laser was utilized as a pumping light source .",

    "the intrinsic q - factor was inferred from the measurement of the bandwidth of the observed resonances in the undercoupled regime .",
    "the modes are characterized with unloaded full width at the half maximum of @xmath18  mhz .",
    "a general criterion to distinguish surface and bulk attenuation in the open optical resonators is the equivalence of the unloaded quality factors of all the resonator modes independently on their polarization .",
    "the modes polarized along the symmetry axis have slightly worse q - factor ( less than 10% ) , which indicates that the surface of the resonator is either slightly damaged or contaminated .",
    "visual inspection has indicated presence of the minor residual scratches that can explain the slight difference in the q - factors because of different impact of surface scattering on q of wgms with different polarization .",
    "nearly the same q - factor was measured at 1319  nm wavelength using diode pumped nd : yag solid state laser .",
    "the laser light had 100  khz linewidth .",
    "it was coupled to the resonator using the same coupling prism .",
    "this measurement shows that the attenuation is rather broadband .",
    "the spectrum of the resonator has distinct azimuthal and latitudinal spectral features , which indicates that the resonator has a slightly spheroidal shape .",
    "the azimuthal free spectral range is 20  ghz .",
    "the latitudinal spectral range depends on the polarization of the modes .",
    "it is @xmath19  mhz for the modes polarized collinearly with the symmetry axis of the resonator , and @xmath20  mhz for the modes polarized perpendicularly to the axis .",
    "we were able to optimize the coupling with the higher order modes by changing the launch angle for the beam of the pumping light impinging on the resonator surface .",

    "the easily observed manifestation of thermal nonlinearity is the visible extension ( or compression ) of wgm resonances observed during sweeping the probe laser : because of the thermal nonlinearity , the trace of the resonance on the screen of oscilloscope changes depending on the laser power and the speed and direction of the laser frequency scan .",
    "this effect is produced by heating the mode volume with the light power absorbed in the material due to nonzero optical absorption .",
    "the process can be described with two time constants , one of which is responsible for flow of heat from the mode volume to the rest of the resonator , and the other  for heat exchange between the resonator and external environment .",
    "the laser scan should be fast compared with the relaxation constants and the light power must be small to reduce the effect .    in the simplest approximation",
    "the evolution of the system can be described with a set of two equations @xcite @xmath28e = f(t ) , \\\\",

    "the thermal nonlinearity becomes important when the power accumulated in the resonator exceeds @xmath46 .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) that thermal nonlinearity of a diamond resonator is very small compared with the thermal nonlinearity of other optical materials , since the thermal conductivity in diamond is significantly larger compared with thermal conductivity of any other optical crystal .",
    "to confirm the conclusion we performed a comparative measurement of thermal nonlinearity of two identical resonators .",
    "one of the resonators was the diamond one , and the other was made with mgf@xmath27 .",
    "the mgf@xmath27 resonator was fabricated so that its @xmath45 was comparable with the q of the diamond resonator . in this case @xmath47 .",
    "it means that thermal nonlinearity becomes visible in magnesium fluoride for pump power hundred times smaller compared with the identical diamond resonator .",
    "the thermal nonlinearity can be significantly suppressed if the resonators of high transparency material are overloaded in such a way that the loaded q becomes much smaller than the absorption - related @xmath45 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "if one is able to maintain extremely low levels of absorption in a resonator with transparent material with @xmath45 much larger than the one of diamond , as in the case of caf@xmath27 @xcite and mgf@xmath27 , the benefit of diamond as extreme thermal conductivity material could become irrelevant .",
    "this , however , is a challenging engineering task , since not only the resonator material must have ultra - low loss , but absorptive contaminations must also be avoided during integration of the resonator .",
    "the diamond resonators have an important advantage compared with resonators of other materials if the goal is to create an ultra - stable cavity .",
    "the ultimate stability of monolithic resonators is limited by fundamental thermodynamic fluctuations existing even if the resonator is kept at constant temperature .",
    "for instance , thermodynamic fluctuation of temperature in the mode volume results in fluctuations of the index of refraction in the mode channel that can be written as @xcite @xmath49 the mean square value of the temperature fluctuation is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath52 is the absolute temperature .",
    "the spectral power density of the fluctuation of the averaged temperature of the mode of a toroidal resonator ( @xmath53 ) is @xcite @xmath54^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spectral density is inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity of the resonator host material .",
    "therefore , the thermorefractive noise will be significantly smaller in a diamond resonator .",
    "the thermal fluctuation does not depend on the loss of the resonator host material .",
    "it shows that the existing resonator already has certain advantages over other , higher - q , crystalline resonators .",
    "by adapting the mechanical polishing technique we have developed , we fabricated quartz wgm resonators @xcite out of cylindrical crystal quartz preforms purchased from two different vendors .",
    "the mechanical polishing was realized with a diamond slurry .",
    "the polishing quality is high enough to ensure negligible surface scattering of light traveling in the wgms .",
    "extremity of the resonators is shaped into toroidal geometry .",
    "modes in the resonators were excited using a sf11 prism coupler and a 1550  nm tunable fiber laser having 4  khz linewidth .",
    "the modes with quality factors approaching @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1quartz]a ) were detected in z - cut resonators ( the symmetry axis of the resonators coincides with the z - axis of quartz ) .",
    "( a ) a wgm resonance belonging to a z - cut quartz wgm resonator . solid line is a lorentzian fit to the experimental data .",
    "the optical power sent to the mode is small enough ( @xmath56w ) to avoid nonlinear processes .",
    "the linewidth corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "( b ) rf return for the modulator based on the x - cut quartz resonator versus rf modulation frequency ( the ratio of the powers of the demodulated signal and the input signal ) .",
    "the input microwave as well as the optical power at the high speed photodetector is equal to 1 mw . the rf return frequency bandwidth is @xmath58  mhz at @xmath59  db .",
    "the loaded quality factor of the optically pumped wgm is @xmath60 ( optical bandwidth is 1  mhz ) .",
    "the optical mode contrast is 50% .",
    "the laser is manually tuned to the mode .",
    "the maximum rf return corresponds to @xmath61.,width=548 ]    because of the crystalline properties a z - cut quartz resonator is not tunable by an electric field applied along its symmetry axis .",
    "we placed metal electrodes on the top and bottom surfaces of a @xmath62 m thick resonator and applied a dc voltage ( as done in @xcite ) .",
    "no measurable voltage - dependent mode shift was observed for the voltage amplitude exceeding 200  v.    to observe the electric tunability of the wgm spectrum we fabricated resonators out of x - cut quartz .",
    "the optical quality of the x - cut crystal quartz samples in our disposal was not good enough",
    "so the maximum q - factor of those resonators was an order of magnitude lower than that of the z - cut resonators .",
    "we have measured the value of the pockels constant of quartz ( first measured by pockels himself @xcite ) by applying a dc voltage to the x - cut resonator s top and bottom surfaces and measuring the frequency shift of the wgms @xcite .",
    "for instance , the te mode family shifts by @xmath63  mhz when we apply @xmath64  v to the @xmath65  @xmath66 m thick disk , so that @xmath67 , where @xmath68  hz is the carrier frequency of the pump light and @xmath69 is the index of refraction of the material at 1550  nm .",
    "the measured value is @xmath70  pm@xmath71v .",
    "interestingly , not only te , but also tm modes experience frequency shifts when the electric field is applied .",
    "this basically means that the modes in our resonator do not have the distinct parallel or orthogonal direction of the electric field with respect to the symmetry axis of the resonator .",
    "electrical tunability of quartz wgm resonators enables wgm electro - optical modulators @xcite ( feasibility of quartz electro - optical modulators have been noted previously @xcite ) .",
    "we have fabricated such a modulator using a standard technique utilized previously with lithium - niobate wgm modulators @xcite .",
    "we mounted a strip line rf resonator on top of the resonator sitting on a polished brass electrode , and tuned the rf resonance frequency such that it became identical to the free spectral range ( fsr ) of the optical resonator .",
    "the strip line was placed at the resonator circumference to ensure an overlap between the rf field and the light confined in the modes .",
    "the resultant rf strip line resonator covered approximately 190@xmath72 of the wgm resonator perimeter .",
    "the full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) of the rf mode was 215  mhz , the rf resonant frequency was @xmath73  ghz , hence the rf quality factor was @xmath74 .    to operate the modulator we sent laser radiation to a wgm and a continuous wave rf signal to the strip line resonator .",
    "the nonzero @xmath75 of quartz ensures the wave mixing process between light and the rf signal .",
    "the wave mixing results in generation of optical sidebands resonant with the optical modes separated from the pumped wgm by an integer number of fsrs .",
    "the first order sidebands grow first , followed by the higher order sidebands .",
    "we demodulated the light escaping the resonator by means of a fast photodiode and observed the rf signal using an rf spectrum analyzer ( fig .",
    "[ fig1quartz]b ) .",
    "it is possible to find the parameters of the modulator using this signal .",
    "the rf return of the modulator can be expressed as @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the numerical parameter taking into account the coupling efficiency of the light into the resonator as well as the type of the modulation ( an all - resonant modulator produces mostly phase modulated light zeroing down @xmath78 ) , @xmath79 is the rf saturation power of the modulator , @xmath80 is the resistivity of the photodiode , @xmath81 is the responsivity of the photodiode , @xmath82 is the power of the light , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the quality factors of the optical and microwave modes , @xmath75 is the electro - optical coefficient of the resonator host material , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the indices of refraction of the material , @xmath87 is the volume of the microwave field , @xmath88 is the overlap integral of the optical and microwave fields , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the spatial distributions of the power of the optical and microwave fields respectively , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 if the rf frequency .    to find the saturation power we use @xmath60 , @xmath93 , @xmath94  ghz , @xmath95 , @xmath70  pm@xmath71v=@xmath96  esu , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99  @xmath100 ( the volume",
    "is given by the 100  @xmath66 wide strip line resonator having @xmath101 length and 220  @xmath66 m thickness ) .",
    "then we estimate @xmath102  mw .",
    "we also know from the experiment that @xmath61 , @xmath103  mw , @xmath104  ohm , and @xmath105  a@xmath71w .",
    "using these values and the calculated value for the saturation pump power we obtain @xmath106 . because @xmath107 is small our modulator generate mostly phase modulated light .",
    "the electro - optical modulator based on the quartz wgm resonator will become extremely important if the quality factor of the optical resonator fabricated from the x - cut material can be significantly increased .",
    "this will cause the saturation power of such a resonator to be low , so the modulation will be very efficient .",
    "the modulator will then also have an extremely narrow bandwidth .",
    "such properties are important in harmonically mode locked lasers @xcite and coupled opto - electronic oscillators @xcite .",
    "indeed , optical etalons have been inserted into the optical loop to improve the performance of harmonically actively mode - locked lasers @xcite , and electro - optical modulators are the key parts of those lasers .",
    "the quartz wgm modulator is able to substitute both the modulator and the etalon in the mode - locked lasers .",
    "the low saturation power of quartz modulator will eliminate the requirement of high power rf amplifiers in oscillators , while the narrow filter function will reduce the phase noise .",
    "a laser locked to a narrow resonance high - finesse resonator is the commonly used source of stable narrow - linewidth optical signals .",
    "extremely narrow linewidth of the wgms in quartz resonators will allow realizing lasers with high short - term stability , while electro - optical tunability of the wgm will allow tuning or modulating the frequency of the lasers .",
    "finally , let us discuss the nonlinear optical properties of the quartz resonators .",
    "it is known that quartz has several raman lines @xcite and possesses a large cubic nonlinearity ( @xmath108  esu , @xmath109 times larger than fused silica @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we should expect to observe stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) as well as four - wave mixing in the quartz resonators as previously observed in fused silica resonators . to examine this , we amplified our laser and pumped the quartz resonators with @xmath110  mw light .",
    "the only effect observed was the srs .",
    "no hyper - parametric oscillations based on four - wave mixing were detected .",
    "the reason for the suppression of the effects will be the subject of further investigations .",
    "we have presented results concerning fabrication of high - q sapphire , diamond , and crystal quartz whispering gallery mode resonators , and demonstrated the highest reported q - factor in a monolithic resonators fabricated out of the materials .",
