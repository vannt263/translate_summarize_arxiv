    "the properties of heavy - flavored hadronic resonances have attracted a lot of attention lately .",
    "the study of such states can help in the interpretation of the nature of particles found in past and ongoing experiments ( e.g. cleo , babar , belle , lhcb )  @xcite , as well as in understanding states which will be discovered in future experiments ( e.g. panda at gsi  @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to understand whether baryon ( meson ) resonances can be described as excited three - quark ( quark - antiquark ) states or rather as hadron molecules ; also a combined interpretation of such states is possible .    at present",
    "there is a lack of a robust scheme to systematically construct an effective field theory approach to study four flavor physics .",
    "some steps in that direction have been taken by recent studies using coupled - channels models . among them",
    "one can find unitarized coupled - channels models @xcite , the jlich meson - exchange model  @xcite and schemes based on hidden gauge formalism  @xcite .",
    "these models are not fully consistent with the heavy - quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) @xcite , which is a proper symmetry of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the limit of infinitely heavy quark masses .",
    "there have also been some attempts to build a scheme based on chiral perturbation theory for hadrons which contain heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "moreover , an effective theory which incorporates heavy - quark , chiral and hidden local gauge symmetries was developed for studying baryon - baryon interactions @xcite .",
    "besides , an su(8 ) spin - flavor symmetric unitarized coupled - channels model has been recently developed and used for various numbers of charm and strangeness @xcite",
    ".    in this paper we study dynamically - generated baryon resonances , using the su(8 ) spin - flavor model .",
    "we have payed special attention to analyze the underlying symmetry of the interaction .",
    "in particular , we have studied the original group multiplets from where each of the found baryon resonances originates and obtained the different hqss multiplets .",
    "our studies covered states with charm and strangeness , and in the following sections we will show and discuss our results for baryon resonances with charm @xmath2 , namely @xmath3 ( strangeness @xmath4 , isospin @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 ( @xmath4 , @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "we use the su(8 ) spin - flavor model of @xcite .",
    "the interaction potential is an extension of the su(3 ) chiral weinberg - tomozawa potential to the su(8 ) symmetry . in this",
    "model vector mesons are treated on equal footing with pseudoscalar mesons and both spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryons are taken into account .",
    "we only consider s - wave interaction , which is appropriate close to the meson - baryon thresholds . in this su(8 ) scheme the mesons fall in the * 63 * -plet , and the baryons are placed in the * 120 * -plet .",
    "consequently , in the s - channel , the baryon - meson space reduces into four su(8 ) irreps , three of which ( * 120 * , * 168 * and * 4752 * ) are attractive .",
    "we find that the multiplets * 120 * and * 168 * are the most attractive ones , and therefore we have concentrated our study on the states which belong to these two irreps in the su(8 ) symmetric limit .",
    "we consider the reduction of the su(8 ) symmetry @xmath13 , where su(6 ) is the spin - flavor group for three light flavors , @xmath14 is the charm quark rotation group , and @xmath15 is the group generated by the charm quantum number @xmath16 .",
    "the su(6 ) multiplets can be reduced under @xmath17 , where @xmath18 refers to the spin of the light quarks .",
    "we further reduce @xmath19 where @xmath20 refers to the total spin @xmath21 ; in this way we make the connection with the labeling ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the contact tree - level meson - baryon interaction of the extended su(8 ) symmetric weinberg - tomozawa potential reads @xmath23 here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the outgoing and incoming baryon - meson channels ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 stand , respectively , for the mass and the center - of - mass energy of the baryon and the meson decay constant in the @xmath24 channel ; @xmath29 are the matrix elements for the various @xmath30 sectors considered in this work , which can be found in the appendices of  @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitudes are calculated by solving the on - shell bethe - salpeter equation in the coupled channels : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is a diagonal matrix containing the baryon - meson propagator for each channel , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are matrices in coupled - channels space .",
    "the bare loop function @xmath36 is logarithmically ultraviolet divergent and needs to be renormalized .",
    "we have renormalized our amplitudes by using a subtraction point regularization , with a subtraction point @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , respectively , the masses of the meson and the baryon of the channel with the lowest threshold in the given @xmath40 sector , @xmath41 in order to get a better fine - tuning with the experimental data , one can define the subtraction point as @xmath42 , with @xmath43 being slightly different from one .",
    "the baryon resonances are obtained as poles of the scattering amplitude on the complex - energy plane .",
    "the mass @xmath44 and the width @xmath45 of the state can be obtained from the coordinate @xmath46 of the corresponding pole on the complex energy @xmath47 plane , @xmath48 , and the couplings to the meson - baryon channels can be found from the residues of the @xmath34-matrix around the pole .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath29 display exact su(8 ) invariance , but this symmetry is severely broken in nature . therefore we implement symmetry - breaking mechanisms .",
    "it should be mentioned here that we have removed the channels with the @xmath49 pairs to be consistent with the hqss . in the present work we use physical values for the masses of the hadrons and for the decay constants of the mesons .",
    "the symmetry is broken following the chain @xmath50 , where the last group @xmath20 refers to isospin .",
    "this symmetry breaking was performed by adiabatic change of the hadron masses and meson weak decay constants . in this way",
    "we can label each baryon resonance with the original group multiplet and define the hqss multiplets .",
    "let us begin with the @xmath3 states . our model generates four @xmath3 baryon resonances , three with spin @xmath51 and one with @xmath52 . by comparing the dominant channels with the decay channels of the experimental states ,",
    "two of our @xmath3 s have been identified with experimentally known states .",
    "we identify the experimental @xmath53 resonance with the state that we found around @xmath54 .",
    "the experimental value of the width of @xmath53 @xmath55 is not reproduced , due to the fact that we have not included the three - body decay channel @xmath56 , which already represents almost one third of the decay events @xcite .",
    "our result for @xmath53 agrees with the results from @xmath57channel vector - meson exchange ( tvme ) models @xcite , but , as it was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , we claim a dominant @xmath58 component in its structure , whereas in the tvme model the @xmath53 is generated mostly as a @xmath59 bound state .",
    "we also obtain a broad resonance with a mass very close to the @xmath53 , namely at @xmath60 .",
    "it couples strongly to the open channel @xmath61 .",
    "the other pole with @xmath51 that we find around @xmath62 has not been identified with any known experimental state .    in the @xmath51 sector",
    "there are 16 coupled channels , which can generate @xmath3 resonances .",
    "every found baryon resonance couples strongly only to some of the coupled channels , see  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we study how the features ( masses , widths and couplings ) of the @xmath3 resonances change , when we consider only the dominant meson - baryon coupled channels .",
    "it turns out that the masses and widths , as well as couplings do not change drastically when we only consider the restricted coupled - channels space .",
    "the width of the @xmath63 resonance increases from 89.8 to 97.3  mev , whereas the mass and the coupling to the @xmath64 stay unchanged .",
    "the @xmath65 resonance slightly increases its mass by 2.6  mev , and the width decreases from 1.2 to 1.1  mev , while the coupling to @xmath58 channel remains almost the same .",
    "finally , the mass of the @xmath66 state raises by 8.6  mev , and its width is now 1.0  mev ; the couplings to the dominant @xmath67 and @xmath68 channels slightly vary .",
    "further , we find one @xmath3 resonance with @xmath52 located at @xmath69 .",
    "we identify this resonance with the experimental @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the experimental @xmath70 has a very narrow width , @xmath71 , and decays mostly to @xmath56 . by changing the subtraction point , such that the mass of the resonance is closer to the value of the experimental one",
    ", the phase space would be reduced .",
    "a similar resonance was found at @xmath72 in the tvme model of ref .",
    "however , in our calculation we obtain a non - negligible contribution from the baryon - vector meson channels to the generation of this resonance , as already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . when restricting the number of coupled channels to the four ones , to which @xmath73 couples the most , namely @xmath74 , @xmath58 , @xmath75 and @xmath68 , the resonance features are changed as follows .",
    "the mass somewhat increases by 1.2  mev , while the width grows by 8.2  mev , and couplings remain almost unchanged .",
    "we obtain three spin-1/2 @xmath6 resonances , with masses 2571.5 , 2622.7 and 2643.4  mev .",
    "these states are predictions of our model , since there is no experimental data in this energy region . in the su(4 )",
    "model of ref .",
    "@xcite two @xmath6 spin-1/2 resonances are predicted . in this reference , the first @xmath6 resonance has a mass @xmath76 and a width of @xmath77 , and it can be associated with the @xmath78 state of our model which we generate with the width @xmath79 . however , in our model this resonance couples most strongly to the channels which incorporate vector mesons , whereas in ref .  @xcite it is not the case . the other resonance predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be compared to any of our results .",
    "further , we obtain two spin-@xmath80 @xmath6 resonances . the first one , a bound state at 2568.4  mev , lies below the threshold of any possible decay channel and is thought to be the charmed counterpart of the hyperonic @xmath81 resonance .",
    "the second state at @xmath82  mev has no direct comparison with the available experimental data .",
    "our model generates six @xmath8 states with @xmath51 and three ones with @xmath52 . in this sector",
    "there are two negative - parity experimentally known resonances that can be identified with some of our dynamically - generated states , namely experimental @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the state @xmath85 has a width of @xmath86 and it decays to @xmath87 , with @xmath88 . we assign it to the @xmath89",
    "mev state found in our model because of the large @xmath90 coupling .",
    "a slight modification of the subtraction point can lower the position of our resonance to @xmath91 and most probably reduce its width as it will get closer to the @xmath87 channel",
    ".    it could be also possible to identify our pole at @xmath92 with the experimental @xmath85 state . in that case",
    ", one would expect that if the resonance position gets closer to the physical mass of @xmath91 , its width will increase and it will easily reach values of the order of @xmath93 .",
    "the full width of the experimental @xmath8 resonance with @xmath94 is expected to be less than @xmath95 for @xmath96 and less than @xmath97 for @xmath98 , and the decay modes are @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "we obtain two resonances at @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively , that couple strongly to @xmath103 , with @xmath104 . allowing for this possible indirect three - body decay channel",
    ", we might identify one of them to the experimental result .",
    "this assignment is possible for the state at @xmath105 if we slightly change the subtraction point , which will lower its position and reduce its width as it gets closer to the threshold of the open @xmath103 channel .",
    "we obtain three @xmath11 bound states with masses @xmath106 , @xmath1075 and @xmath108  mev .",
    "there is no experimental information on those excited states .",
    "however , our predictions can be compared to recent calculations of ref .  @xcite . in this work",
    "three @xmath11 resonances are predicted , with masses higher than the ones of our resonances by approximately 100  mev .",
    "further , we obtain two spin-@xmath80 bound states @xmath11 with masses @xmath109 and @xmath110  mev , which mainly couple to @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and to @xmath113 , respectively . as in the @xmath51 sector",
    ", no experimental information is available here .",
    "charmed baryon resonances , in particular @xmath3 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 odd - parity states have been studied within a coupled - channels unitary approach that implements hqss . for this purpose the su(8 )",
    "spin - flavor symmetric model of ref .",
    "@xcite has been used .",
    "we have obtained four @xmath3 baryon resonances , two of which can be identified with the experimental @xmath53 and @xmath70 states . when the number of coupled channels is reduced to the dominant ones , the features ( mass , width , coupling constants ) of the corresponding resonance do not change significantly .",
    "further , five @xmath6 and nine @xmath8 resonances are obtained .",
    "some of our resonances can be identified with experimentally known @xmath6 and @xmath8 states , while others require the compilation of more data and a refinement of the model .",
