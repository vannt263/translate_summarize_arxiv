    "the experiments were performed with si [ 100 ] surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions ( @xmath2 10@xmath3 mbar ) .",
    "the monocrystalline si target was irradiated at an angle of incidence of 45 using a ti : sapphire laser system ( mai - tai coupled with tsa amplifier , spectra physics , 80 fs pulse duration , 10 hz repetition rate , up to 30 mj energy per pulse ) operating at wavelengths of 800 , 400 , and 266 nm .",
    "a part of the laser beam was selected by an aperture to provide a nearly uniform intensity distribution over the irradiated spot .",
    "the target was rotated / translated during measurements to avoid considerable cratering . for each wavelength ,",
    "series of craters at several laser energies were produced on the stationary sample . by measuring the crater areas ,",
    "the absolute calibration of laser fluence was performed .",
    "the laser fluence on the target was varied in the ranges 80@xmath4800 , 20@xmath5200 , 5@xmath450 mj/@xmath6 at wavelengths of 800 , 400 , and 266 nm , respectively .",
    "the abundance distributions of neutral and cationic particles in the laser - induced plume were analyzed by a reflectron time - of - flight mass spectrometer ( tof ms ) .",
    "when ions were studied , the plume was allowed to expand under field - free conditions .",
    "while the neutral particles of the plume were analyzed , the ionized species were rejected using a simple plasma suppressor @xcite .",
    "the latter consisted of a pair of deflection plates placed along the plume axis in front of the ion source of the ms where neutral particles were ionized by impact of 110 ev electrons . at a distance of 11 cm from the target ,",
    "the ions , either ablated or post - ionized , were sampled parallel to the plume expansion axis by a 500 v repeller pulse after a delay time @xmath7 , following the laser pulse .",
    "all mass spectra were averaged over 300 laser shots .",
    "efficient emission of both neutral silicon clusters si@xmath0 ( up to @xmath8 = 6 ) and their cations si@xmath1 ( up to @xmath8 = 10 ) have been observed for all investigated wavelengths .",
    "si atoms and si@xmath9 ions were the most abundant particles at all laser fluences .",
    "though , at certain irradiation regimes , the cluster fraction exceeded 10% of that of si atoms and ions in the ablation plume .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows typical mass spectra of cationic and neutral plume species , respectively .",
    "the spectra were obtained under the irradiation conditions corresponding to the maximum relative yield of the clusters with respect to monatomic particles .",
    "the abundance distributions are smooth under these conditions with peak intensities monotonously decreasing with cluster size . as it will be discussed below , the velocity distributions for ionized plume particles are strongly dependent on particle mass .",
    "the ion mass spectra are , therefore , different for particles expanding in the faster and the slower parts of the plume .",
    "the mass spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a was obtained at the time delay corresponding to the maximum yield of si@xmath10 dimer .",
    "a variation in the time delay @xmath7 allowed the analysis of particle velocity distributions and the characterization of the temporal evolution of the plume composition .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows typical tof distributions of si@xmath11 ions for different fluences .",
    "we have found that the distributions are weakly affected by both laser wavelength and fluence . in all cases , they reach the maximum at @xmath29 @xmath12s time delay that corresponds to the ion velocity of around 12 km / s , or to a kinetic energy of @xmath220 ev .",
    "an increase in laser fluence results only in a broadening of the distributions with a negligible shift towards higher velocities . at the same time",
    ", the total number of si@xmath9 ions increases strongly with fluence .",
    "the ion yield at a given fluence can be evaluated by integrating the tof distributions in time . to obtain the values proportional to the total number of the plume particles at various fluences , this procedure should be corrected for angular distributions of expanding particles as a function of their velocity (",
    "usually fast plume species are more forward directed than slow ones @xcite ) .",
    "the angular distributions were not measured in this work , but , since the ion velocity distributions are similar for different conditions ( fig.[fig2 ] ) , such a correction is not necessary for si@xmath9 ions .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the yields of plume ions as a function of laser fluence for three laser wavelengths .",
    "these dependencies show a steep gradient that is nearly identical for 800 and 400-nm wavelengths . for 266-nm , it is slightly weaker .",
    "we note that the total number of detected particles varies by around 6 orders of magnitude in the studied fluence ranges .",
    "the threshold fluences , @xmath13 , for ion appearance in the plume , as deduced from ms measurements are around 100 , 40 , and 10 mj/@xmath6 for 800 , 400 , and 266 nm , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that our ion detection system has a high sensitivity to detect a single plume ion . as a result",
    ", the obtained values correspond to the _ real _ thresholds for ion appearance but not to the ion _ detection _ threshold .",
    "cluster ions si@xmath1 were observed throughout the laser fluence range studied , even at very low fluences close to the threshold for si ions ( at least for dimers ) .",
    "the clusters are found to be considerably slower than atomic ions . at near - threshold fluences , the tof distributions for si@xmath10 dimers",
    "are maximized at @xmath1418 @xmath12s for all wavelengths .",
    "the most probable velocity of the dimers is , therefore , approximately two times lower than that of si@xmath9 .",
    "this means that these plume particles have nearly the same momentum under these conditions .",
    "however , the si@xmath15 trimers are faster than it would be expected for constant momentum ( the tof distributions are maximized at around 21 @xmath12s ) .    by integrating the cluster tof distributions in time , the total number of clusters in the plume as a function of fluence was also evaluated . for low fluences ,",
    "the total number of the detected dimers increases with fluence and reaches maximum at @xmath16/@xmath17 2 for 800 nm and at @xmath16/@xmath18 4 for 400 nm .",
    "the maximum values of the population ratios si@xmath19/si@xmath9 are around 0.18 and 0.22 for 800 and 400 nm respectively . further increase in fluence results in an abrupt fall of the relative concentration of the dimers .",
    "this decrease of the si@xmath10 abundance in the plume is due to both overall decrease of the relative cluster yield at high fluences and to a conversion of si@xmath10 into larger cluster .",
    "the performed tof integration shows the fast increase of the si@xmath20 and si@xmath21 cluster abundance with fluence at @xmath22 400 mj/@xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to si@xmath9 ions , the tof distributions of clusters strongly depend on the laser fluence .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the evolution of the tof distribution for the si@xmath10 dimer at different fluences .",
    "these results were obtained for excitation at 800 nm . at very low fluences , below @xmath2 200 mj/@xmath6",
    "( @xmath23 2@xmath24 , the distributions are rather narrow , single - peaked , and maximized at @xmath218 @xmath12s . for laser fluences above 2@xmath13 , the behavior of si@xmath10 changes dramatically . in the fluence range between 2@xmath13 and 4@xmath13",
    ", the tof distributions are still single - peaked but their maxima are significally shifted towards higher time delays ( lower velocities ) . at @xmath254@xmath13 ,",
    "the maximum is at @xmath225 @xmath12s ( the corresponding most probable velocity is @xmath2 4.4 km / s ) .",
    "the fast cluster ions are still present in this ablation regime , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , but their distribution is masked by slower ions . with further increase in laser fluence the second slower population of si@xmath10 ions with the most probable velocity of around 2.7",
    "km / s appears in the plume . at fluences above @xmath25.5@xmath26 ,",
    "this slow population becomes dominant .",
    "the first faster peak in the distribution ( corresponding to the cluster ions detected in the ( 2@xmath274)@xmath26 fluence range ) is still present , well separated from the second peak , and is still maximized at @xmath225 @xmath12s .",
    "however , its intensity is much lower then at low fluences .",
    "the fast cluster ions ( those observed at @xmath28 2@xmath24 are not detected anymore .",
    "the fluence dependency of the tof distributions for larger si@xmath1 clusters ( @xmath8 = 3@xmath276 ) under under 800-nm excitation is found to be qualitatively similar to that for si@xmath10 . at a threshold fluence of around 450 mj/@xmath6 , the distributions are transformed from the single - peaked one to the double - peaked with the second ( slow ) cluster population becoming rapidly dominant with further increase in fluence .",
    "the most probable velocity of the second population slightly decreases with cluster size from 2.5 km / s for si@xmath10 to 2 km / s for si@xmath29 .",
    "the abundance distribution for this slow cluster population is remarkably different from that for fast clusters ( shown in fig . [",
    "the si@xmath30 and si@xmath31 cluster ions are more abundant than their odd - numbered neighbors . for larger time delays ,",
    "the si@xmath31 cluster becomes dominant particle in the plume .",
    "based on the obtained results , we can address the fundamental questions on the mechanism of cluster formation .",
    "are the observed clusters formed primarily by their direct ejection from the target or by gas - phase aggregation of ablated atoms ?",
    "which process is responsible for such a transformation of the cluster velocity distribution as shown in fig .",
    "the set of the obtained tof distributions and fluence dependencies provides a clear evidence for cluster formation mechanisms at different irradiation regimes . at very low laser fluence , from ion appearance threshold @xmath13 up to @xmath22@xmath26 , si@xmath9 and si@xmath10 ions",
    "are produced by an impulsive coulomb explosion ( ce ) from a charged surface .",
    "we argue this by the following :    \\(a ) the observed momentum scaling for the particles and a very weak dependence of their expansion velocities on laser fluence and wavelength in the low fluence regimes indicates directly the ce mechanism @xcite . the repulsive electric field induced in the target by the fs - laser pulse lasts for a short period of time ( @xmath21 ps ) .",
    "both si@xmath9 and si@xmath19 spend roughly the same time in the action range of this field .",
    "the time of electrostatic interaction leading to the ion removal is thus many orders of magnitude shorter than the ion flight time to the mass spectrometer that results in equal momenta for the ejected si@xmath9 and si@xmath10 ions as seen experimentally ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "we suggest that the electric field under these conditions is strong enough to repulse positive ions from the surface but not so strong to break the bonds of ejected clusters .",
    "note that thermally desorbed particles are characterized by equal kinetic energy rather than momentum @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) an additional support for the ce is the high velocity of si@xmath19 ions at low fluences . for fluences beyond @xmath22@xmath13 ,",
    "the most probable velocity decreases that indicate the appearance of an additional ablation channel .",
    "for thermally desorbed particles one would expect the opposite behavior with fluence .",
    "contrarily , the slower si@xmath1 clusters ( which overshadow the coulomb explosion ions in the 2@xmath324@xmath13 fluence range and form the fast cluster population at higher fluences ) can be interpreted as `` plasma ions '' , i.e. , ions formed in the gas - phase ionized vapor plume .",
    "also , we should take in consideration the direct thermal evaporation of small clusters from the surface ( desorption of si@xmath0 clusters up to @xmath8 = 6 was observed from thermally heated si @xcite ) .",
    "the velocities of these `` plasma ions '' decrease only slightly with cluster size and scale by a law intermediate between constant kinetic energy and constant velocity .",
    "in conclusion , we present the first analysis of expansion dynamics of monoatomic species and small clusters after femtosecond laser ablation of clean ( 100 ) si surface . while our results unambiguously show the domination of nonthermal mechanism of nanocluster emission at low laser fluence , more studies is needed to be certain about the origin of the ions under all the irradiation conditions ."
