    "it is well known that string theory can be formulated only in ten dimensions .",
    "hence , it is necessary to reconcile this prediction with our real world by compactifying extra - dimensions or by considering braneworld .",
    "intriguingly , in the context of the braneworld with large extra - dimensions , black holes could be created at the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "hence , the stability of higher dimensional black holes becomes important since these black holes could be produced at the lhc if the spacetime has larger than six dimensions .    the stability of higher dimensional black holes has been an active topic since the seminal papers by kodama and ishibashi  @xcite .",
    "it is important to study various black holes in einstein theory because black holes produced at the lhc are expected to be charged or rotating .",
    "a numerical study of charged black holes has been done  @xcite . to investigate the stability of rotating black holes , a group theoretical method is developed  @xcite .",
    "the method is used to study the stability of squashed black holes  @xcite and 5-dimensional rotating black holes  @xcite .",
    "the stability of rotating black holes in more than 5-dimensions is also studied  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to consider the stability of black holes in more general gravitational theories because black holes are produced at the planck scale where einstein theory would be no longer valid .",
    "in fact , it is known that einstein theory is merely a low energy limit of string theory  @xcite . in string theory , there are higher curvature corrections in addition to einstein - hilbert term  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to extend gravitational theory into those with higher power of curvature in higher dimensions .",
    "it is lovelock theory that belongs to such class of theories  @xcite . in lovelock theory",
    ", it is known that there exist static black hole solutions  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to suppose black holes produced at the lhc are of this type  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to study the stability of these lovelock black holes .    in the case of second order lovelock theory , the so - called einstein - gauss - bonnet theory ,",
    "the stability analysis under tensor perturbations has been performed  @xcite ( see also an earlier work  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis has been also extended to the scalar and vector perturbations  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that there exists the scalar mode instability in five dimensions , the tensor mode instability in six dimensions , and no instability in other dimensions . in the case of third order lovelock theory ,",
    "the stability analysis of lovelock black holes under tensor perturbations has been done by us  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that there is the instability for small black holes in eight dimensions .",
    "although third order lovelock theory is the most general theory in seven and eight dimensions , it is not so in more than eight dimensions .",
    "for example , when we consider ten dimensional black holes , we need to incorporate fourth order lovelock terms .",
    "indeed , when we consider black holes at the lhc , it is important to consider these higher order lovelock terms  @xcite .",
    "hence , in this paper , we study the stability of black holes in any order lovelock theory , namely , in any dimensions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ seq:2 ]",
    ", we review lovelock theory and explain a graphical method for constructing lovelock black hole solutions .",
    "in section [ seq:3 ] , we present a master equation for tensor perturbations in the background of lovelock black holes and reveal its universal structure . in section [ seq:4 ] , we examine the stability of lovelock black holes with the method developed previously  @xcite .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section [ seq:5 ] .",
    "in this section , we review lovelock theory and introduce a graphical method to obtain asymptotically flat black hole solutions .    in @xcite , the most general symmetric , divergence free rank ( 1,1 ) tensor is constructed out of a metric and its first and second derivatives .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian can be constructed from @xmath0-th order lovelock terms @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the riemann tensor in @xmath3-dimensions and @xmath4 is the generalized totally antisymmetric kronecker delta .",
    "then , lovelock lagrangian in @xmath3-dimensions is defined by @xmath5 where we define the maximum order @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 are arbitrary constants . here ,",

    "hereafter , we set @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for convenience . taking variation of the lagrangian with respect to the metric , we can derive lovelock equation @xmath12    as is shown in @xcite , there exist static exact solutions of lovelock equation .",
    "let us consider the following metric @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the metric of @xmath15-dimensional constant curvature space with a curvature @xmath16=1,0 or -1 . using this metric ansatz",
    ", we can calculate riemann tensor components as @xmath17 substituting ( [ eq : riemann ] ) into ( [ eq : eom ] ) and defining a new variable @xmath18 by @xmath19 we obtain an algebraic equation @xmath20\\equiv\\sum_{m=2}^{k}\\left[\\frac{a_m}{m}\\left\\{\\prod_{p=1}^{2m-2}(n - p)\\right\\}\\psi^m\\right]+\\psi-\\frac{2\\lambda}{n(n+1)}=\\frac{\\mu}{r^{n+1 } }   \\ .",

    ", we want to concentrate on asymptotically flat spherically symmetric , @xmath26 , solutions with a positive adm mass @xmath27 because such black holes could be created at the lhc .",
    "we also assume that lovelock coefficients satisfy @xmath28 for simplicity .",
    "for example , consider @xmath29 for which eq.([eq : poly ] ) becomes third order algebraic equation .",
    "though we have a formula for solutions of eq.([eq : poly ] ) in this case , the roots are too complicated in general .",
    "hence , we use a graphical method illustrated in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "because of the conditions ( [ eq : conditions ] ) , the function is monotonic for positive @xmath30 . from ( [ eq : poly ] ) , we see the root behaves @xmath31 or @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",

    "only @xmath35 one corresponds to an asymptotically flat solution.,width=453,height=302 ]    note that the horizon radius of the asymptotically flat solution is characterized by @xmath36 . from ( [ eq : def ] ) , we have a relation @xmath37 . using this relation and ( [ eq : poly ] )",

    "it is obvious from fig.[fig:2 ] that @xmath41 corresponds to @xmath42 when @xmath25 describes an asymptotically flat solution .",
    "it is also obvious that @xmath39 becomes larger as @xmath22 is smaller .",
    "note that there may be no horizon if @xmath22 is too small ( for example , in seven dimensions , there is no horizon if @xmath43 ) .",
    "case , this figure explains a method for calculating @xmath39 or @xmath40 graphically.,width=453,height=302 ]    using the metric ansatz ( [ eq : solution ] ) , the kretschmann scalar @xmath44 is @xmath45 then , this solution has curvature singularities at @xmath46 or where derivatives of @xmath25 diverges . for asymptotically flat spherical symmetric solutions ,",
    "the conditions @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are satisfied except for @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , there is a curvature singularity only at @xmath46 in the cases we are considering . and asymptotically flat solutions have a horizon if the parameter @xmath22 is sufficiently large .",
    "so , this solution does nt have a naked singularity and describes a black hole with a mass m defined in ( [ eq : adm ] ) and no angular momentum .",
    "to analyze the stability , it is convenient to decompose the metric under the symmetry of @xmath50-dimensional symmetric space .",
    "there are scalar , vector , and tensor modes . in this paper",
    ", we study tensor perturbations . in this section",
    ", we do not restrict parameters .",
    "we consider tensor perturbations around the solution ( [ eq : solution ] ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 represents the dynamical degrees of freedom . here , @xmath54 are defined by @xmath55 here , @xmath56 denotes a covariant derivative with respect to @xmath57 . here , the eigenvalue is given by @xmath58 , ( @xmath59 ) for @xmath26 and negative real number for @xmath60 .    perturbing the lovelock equation ( [ eq : eom ] )",
    ", we can get the first order perturbation equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents the first order variation of the riemann tensor .",
    "since we are considering tensor perturbations , apparently we have @xmath63 . to calculate @xmath64 , we only need @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the reason is simple .",
    "we consider , for example , the term proportional to @xmath68 in @xmath69 .",
    "this means @xmath70 or @xmath71 in ( [ eq : pert ] ) ; and @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath74 consists of kronecker delta , there must exist @xmath75 such that @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "then @xmath78 or @xmath79 must be @xmath80 because of background riemann tensor ( [ eq : riemann ] ) .",
    "so , for example , @xmath81 and @xmath78 become @xmath80 . noticing that @xmath74 is totally antisymmetric",
    ", we see @xmath82 when @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the coefficient of @xmath68 in @xmath69 must be 0 .",
    "for the same reason , coefficients of other than @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 vanish . from the metric ansatz ( [ eq : solution ] ) , the necessary components can be deduced as @xmath84{\\bar h}_{i}{}^{j }        \\ .\\label{eq : deltariemann}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , using the following relation @xmath85 we can calculate @xmath64 as follows : @xmath86,\\label{eq : deltag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 .",

    "\\label{h : w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    separating the variables @xmath91 , we can deduce the master equation from ( [ eq : pert ] ) and ( [ eq : deltag ] ) as follows : @xmath92 here , we should notice that we have not used information about lovelock coefficients and @xmath25 .",
    "hence , this master equation itself is very general , although we will consider specific situations in the next section .",
    "moreover , this equation is the same as the master equation in  @xcite except for the concrete form of @xmath93 .",
    "hence , the method used in  @xcite can also be applicable .",
    "in this section , we first clarify condition for the stability of black holes .",
    "then , we demonstrate that small black holes are always unstable in even - dimensions .      in this section , we assume the conditions ( [ eq : conditions ] ) are satisfied .",
    "then , there exists an asymptotically flat branch .",
    "and we also assume spherical symmetry and positivity of the mass , i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "as we will soon see , the master equation ( [ eq : master_eq ] ) can be transformed into the schr@xmath94dinger form . to do this",
    ", we have to impose the condition @xmath95 in fact , this is necessary for the linear analysis to be applicable . in the case that there exists @xmath96 such that @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we encounter a singularity .",
    "in fact , using approximations @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we can show the solution near @xmath96 is given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are constants of integration .",
    "the solution is singular at @xmath105 for generic perturbations .",
    "the similar situation occurs even in cosmology with higher derivative terms  @xcite . in those cases",
    ", this kind of singularity alludes to ghosts .",
    "indeed , there is a region @xmath106 outside horizon where kinetic term of perturbations has wrong sign .",
    "hence , we simply assume these black hole solutions are not allowed .    when the condition ( [ eq : assum ] ) is fulfilled , introducing a new variable @xmath107 and switching to the coordinate @xmath108 , defined by @xmath109 , we can rewrite eq.([eq : master_eq ] ) as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an effective potential .    for discussing the stability ,",
    "the `` s - deformation '' approach is useful  @xcite .",
    "let us define the operator @xmath112 acting on smooth functions defined on @xmath113 .",
    "then , ( [ eq : shradinger ] ) is the eigenequation and @xmath114 is eigenvalue of @xmath115 .",
    "we also define the inner products as @xmath116 in this case , for any @xmath117 , we can find a smooth function @xmath118 such that @xmath119 where we have defined @xmath120 following  @xcite , we choose @xmath118 to be @xmath121 then , we obtain the formula @xmath122 here , the point is that the second term in ( [ eq : stab ] ) includes a factor @xmath123 , but @xmath88 does not include @xmath124 .",
    "hence , by taking a sufficiently large @xmath125 , we can always make the second term dominant .",
    "now , let us show that the sign of @xmath126 determines the stability . if @xmath127 on @xmath128 , the solution ( [ eq : solution ] ) is stable .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "note that @xmath129 , then we have @xmath130 for this case .",
    "that means @xmath131 for arbitrary @xmath117 if @xmath132 on @xmath128 .",
    "we choose , for example , @xmath117 as the lowest eigenstate , then we can conclude that the lowest eigenvalue @xmath133 is positive .",
    "thus , we proved the stability . the other way around , if @xmath134 at some point in @xmath128 , the solution is unstable .",
    "to prove this , the inequality @xmath135 is useful .",
    "this inequality is correct for arbitrary @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath136 at some point in @xmath128 , we can find @xmath117 such that @xmath137 in this case , ( [ eq : stab ] ) is negative for sufficiently large @xmath138 .",
    "then , the inequality ( [ eq : ineq ] ) implies @xmath139 and the solution has unstable modes .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the solution is stable if and only if @xmath132 on @xmath128 .",
    "to summarize , we need to check the sign of @xmath140 outside the horizon @xmath141 to investigate the stability . note that the condition @xmath142 is necessary to have healthy black holes .      here , we assume @xmath93 is positive outside the horizon",
    ". otherwise , such black holes are already sick .",
    "hence , what we have to do is to check the sign of @xmath140 .    in order to see the sign of @xmath140",
    ", it is very useful to express it as function of @xmath30 instead of that of @xmath143 . using ( [ eq : poly ] ) and its derivative",

    "the result reads @xmath146 similarly , @xmath140 can be written as @xmath147\\ .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath34 $ ] is a polynomial function of @xmath30 and @xmath148 is positive , we can determine the sign of @xmath140 by examining the sign of polynomial determined by the above formula .",
    "thus , the stability problem has been reduced to an algebraic one .",
    "substituting the explicit form of @xmath34 $ ] into this equation , we obtain @xmath149}{\\left(1+\\sum_{m=2}^{k}\\left[a_m\\left\\{\\prod_{p=1}^{2m-2}(n - p)\\right\\}\\psi^{m}\\right]\\right)^3}\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : dhpsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the lowest and leading term of @xmath150 is @xmath151 we note that the highest order @xmath152 $ ] is related to the dimensions as @xmath153 in odd - dimensions and @xmath154 in even - dimensions . in odd - dimensions ,",
    "the leading term disappears .",
    "hence , we can not say anything in general .",
    "hence , we consider only even - dimensions .",
    "let us examine the sign of @xmath155 . if @xmath156 , the coefficient of the lowest term is positive and that of the leading one of ( [ eq : l ] ) becomes negative . therefore @xmath157 near @xmath158 and @xmath159 for large @xmath160 .",
    "this means that there exists roots of @xmath161 because @xmath150 is continuity function ; we define @xmath162 as the lowest positive root .",
    "if @xmath163 , then @xmath164>0 $ ] for @xmath165 , and hence we see @xmath166 for @xmath141 . while , if @xmath167 , then there exists a region @xmath164<0 $ ] in @xmath168 , and thus there exists an area @xmath169 in @xmath141 . therefore ,",
    "black holes are stable if @xmath170 and unstable if @xmath167 . considering the result that @xmath39 becomes larger as @xmath22 , which is related to adm mass , becomes smaller , we conclude that there exist critical mass below which black holes become unstable .    summarizing this section , there is critical mass below which black holes are unstable in @xmath156 .",
    "thus , we have shown the instability of small lovelock black holes in even - dimensions .",
    "we have studied the stability of static black holes in lovelock theory which is a natural higher dimensional generalization of einstein theory . we derived a master equation for tensor perturbations in general lovelock theory .",
    "it turned out that the resultant equation is characterized by one functional @xmath34 $ ] which determines the background black hole solutions through eq.([eq : poly ] ) .",
    "the stability issue of static black holes under tensor perturbations in general dimensions has been reduced to an algebraic problem .",
    "we have shown that there exists the instability of lovelock black holes with small masses in even - dimensions . remarkably , the instability is strong on short distance scales .",
    "curiously , the similar instability also appears in the gauss - bonnet cosmology  @xcite .",
    "we have done the analysis of tensor perturbations and found the instability of small black holes in even - dimensions .",
    "taking into account the results in gauss - bonnet theory  @xcite , if we extend the analysis to scalar and vector perturbations , we can expect that small black holes are unstable also in odd - dimensions .",
    "if so , we need more profound understanding of the instability in lovelock theory .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the fate of the instability .",
    "as the instability is stronger for higher multipole orders @xmath171 , the resultant geometry would be weird .",
    "this issue is very important because black holes lose their mass due to the hawking radiation and eventually become unstable .",
    "related to the above , we have to find meaning of the universal function @xmath93 . as was shown in this paper",
    ", this function governs the stability of black holes .",
    "therefore , if @xmath93 has , for example , thermodynamical meaning , the relation between thermodynamical  @xcite and dynamical instability might be revealed .",
