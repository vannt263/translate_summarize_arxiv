    "we are interested in the relationship between monopoles and classical chaos across the phase transition at @xmath3 .",
    "we begin with a @xmath4 u(1 ) gauge theory described by the euclidean action @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 following ref .",
    "@xcite , we have factorized our gauge configurations into monopole and photon fields .",
    "the u(1 ) plaquette angles @xmath8 are decomposed into the `` physical '' electromagnetic flux through the plaquette @xmath9 and a number @xmath10 of dirac strings through the plaquette @xmath11 where @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 is called a dirac plaquette .",
    "chaotic dynamics in general is characterized by the spectrum of lyapunov exponents .",
    "these exponents , if they are positive , reflect an exponential divergence of initially adjacent configurations . in case of symmetries inherent in the hamiltonian of the system",
    "there are corresponding zero values of these exponents . finally negative exponents belong to irrelevant directions in the phase space : perturbation components in these directions die out exponentially .",
    "pure gauge fields on the lattice show a characteristic lyapunov spectrum consisting of one third of each kind of exponents  @xcite . assuming this general structure of the lyapunov spectrum we first investigate its magnitude , namely the maximal value of the lyapunov exponent , @xmath14 .",
    "the general definition of the lyapunov exponent is based on a distance measure @xmath15 in phase space , @xmath16 in case of conservative dynamics the sum of all lyapunov exponents is zero according to liouville s theorem , @xmath17 .",
    "we utilize the gauge invariant distance measure consisting of the local differences of energy densities between two @xmath18 field configurations on the lattice : @xmath19 here the symbol @xmath20 stands for the sum over all @xmath21 plaquettes , so this distance is bound in the interval @xmath22 for the group su(n ) . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the familiar plaquette variables , constructed from the basic link variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 located on lattice links pointing from the position @xmath27 to @xmath28 . the generator of the group @xmath29 is @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the vector potential . the elementary plaquette variable is constructed for a plaquette with a corner at @xmath32 and lying in the @xmath33-plane as @xmath34 .",
    "it is related to the magnetic field strength @xmath35 : @xmath36 the electric field strength @xmath37 is related to the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath38 via @xmath39    the hamiltonian of the lattice gauge field system can be casted into the form @xmath40.\\ ] ] here the scalar product stands for @xmath41 .",
    "the staple variable @xmath42 is a sum of triple products of elementary link variables closing a plaquette with the chosen link @xmath43 . this way the hamiltonian",
    "is formally written as a sum over link contributions and @xmath42 plays the role of the classical force acting on the link variable @xmath43 .",
    "we prepare the initial field configurations from a standard four dimensional euclidean monte carlo program on a @xmath44 lattice varying the inverse gauge coupling @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "we relate such four dimensional euclidean lattice field configurations to minkowskian momenta and fields for the three dimensional hamiltonian simulation by selecting a fixed time slice of the four dimensional lattice .",
    "we start the presentation of our results with a characteristic example of the time evolution of the distance between initially adjacent configurations .",
    "an initial state prepared by a standard four dimensional monte carlo simulation is evolved according to the classical hamiltonian dynamics in real time . afterwards",
    "this initial state is rotated locally by group elements which are chosen randomly near to the unity .",
    "the time evolution of this slightly rotated configuration is then pursued and finally the distance between these two evolutions is calculated at the corresponding times .",
    "a typical exponential rise of this distance followed by a saturation can be inspected in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] from an example of u(1 ) gauge theory in the confinement phase and in the coulomb phase .",
    "while the saturation is an artifact of the compact distance measure of the lattice , the exponential rise ( the linear rise of the logarithm ) can be used for the determination of the leading lyapunov exponent .",
    "the left plot exhibits that in the confinement phase the original field and its monopole part have similar lyapunov exponents whereas the photon part has a smaller @xmath46 .",
    "the right plot in the coulomb phase suggests that all slopes and consequently the lyapunov exponents of all fields decrease substantially .",
    "the main result of the present study is the dependence of the leading lyapunov exponent @xmath14 on the inverse coupling strength @xmath45 , displayed in fig .",
    "as expected the strong coupling phase is more chaotic .",
    "the transition reflects the critical coupling to the coulomb phase .",
    "the plot shows that the monopole fields carry lyapunov exponents of nearly the same size as the full u(1 ) fields .",
    "the photon fields yield a non - vanishing value in the confinement ascending toward @xmath47 for randomized fields which indicates that the decomposition works well only around the phase transition .",
    "an interesting result concerning the continuum limit can be viewed from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which shows the energy dependence of the lyapunov exponents for the u(1 ) theory and its components .",
    "one observes an approximately linear relation for the monopole part while a quadratic relation is suggested for the photon part in the weak coupling regime . from scaling arguments",
    "one expects a functional relationship between the lyapunov exponent and the energy @xcite @xmath48 with the exponent @xmath49 being crucial for the continuum limit of the classical field theory .",
    "a value of @xmath50 leads to a divergent lyapunov exponent , while @xmath51 yields a vanishing @xmath52 in the continuum .",
    "the case @xmath53 is special allowing for a finite non - zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "our analysis of the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) gives evidence , that the classical compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory and especially the photon field have @xmath54 and with @xmath55 a regular continuum theory .",
    "the monopole field signals @xmath56 and stays chaotic approaching the continuum .",
    "instead of the classical determination of the lyapunov exponent , which has been calculated by the rescaling method in the preceding sections , we now use the monodromy matrix approach  @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov spectrum @xmath57 is expressed in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath58 of the monodromy matrix @xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the solutions of the characteristic equation for @xmath62 degrees of freedom @xmath63 at a given time @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath59 is the linear stability matrix , @xmath65 with the three dimensional lattice action @xmath66 .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] displays the complex eigenvalues for selected configurations prepared by a quantum monte carlo heat - bath algorithm . in the confinement phase ( @xmath67 ) the eigenvalues lie on either the real or on the imaginary axes .",
    "this is a nice illustration of a strange attractor of a chaotic system .",
    "positive lyapunov exponents eject the trajectories from oscillating orbits provided by the imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "negative lyapunov exponents attract the trajectories keeping them confined in the basin . in the coulomb phase ( @xmath68 ) the real lyapunov exponents become rare to eventually vanish in the continuum limit ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) . in all cases",
    "the spectrum is symmetric with respect to the real and imaginary axes : the former property is due to the fact that the equations of motion are real , the latter is due to the hamiltonian being conservative ( time independent ) .",
    "also a number of zero - frequency modes occur which is connected to symmetry transformations commuting ( in the poisson bracket sense ) with the hamiltonian , such as time independent gauge transformations .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the real part of the squared lyapunov spectrum for several couplings .",
    "the overall pattern is similar to that obtained earlier for su(2 ) studies with random configurations  @xcite .",
    "it exhibits an increasing number of zero modes with increasing @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] gives insight into the distribution of the squared eigenvalues which is symmetric for @xmath47 and is shifted to negative values towards the coulomb phase .",
    "this contribution was devoted to the relation between monopoles , lyapunov exponents and confinement in a ( classical ) compact u(1 ) theory .",
    "a decomposition into a monopole and photon part showed that the monopole field carries the same lyapunov exponent as the original u(1 ) field . in the continuum limit",
    "the photon and u(1 ) fields behave regularly while the monopole part stays chaotic .",
    "this was substantiated by the spectrum of the monodromy matrix exhibiting an interplay between positive , imaginary and negative lyapunov exponents in the confinement phase changing to a pure imaginary spectrum deep in the coulomb phase leading to the regularity of the maxwell theory .",
    "it will be interesting to compute the spectrum of the stability matrix on the photon and monopole part of the u(1 ) field .",
    "an analysis of the behavior of the monopoles in the classical u(1 ) theory in minkowski space is a challenge by itself .",
