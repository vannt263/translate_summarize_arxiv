    "the singularity theorems of hawking and penrose @xcite predict the occurrence of spacetime singularities inside black holes under very plausible assumptions .",
    "however , they tell us nothing about the geometrical and physical nature and properties of these singularities . the kerr black hole , which describes the exterior of realistic black holes , fails to describe adequately their interiors . in the kerr solution",
    "the singularity has the shape of a ring , and it is timelike .",
    "consequently , it violates the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis of penrose @xcite .",
    "however , the kerr solution is unstable , in the sense that the cauchy horizon is converted into a spacetime singularity .",
    "this singularity is null and weak @xcite .",
    "namely , infalling extended observers would experience only finite tidal distortions at the singularity .",
    "because of the complexities involved with the analysis of spinning black holes , a frequently used toy model is the spherical charged black hole . although realistic black holes are not expected to be significantly charged , the spherical charged black holes share many common properties and similar causal structure with the more realistic spinning black holes . with spherical symmetry , non - trivial dynamics can be modeled by a scalar field , which has a spherically symmetric radiative mode . in recent numerical analyses with",
    "this toy model ( namely , a spherical charged black hole perturbed non - linearly by a self - gravitating scalar field ) it has been shown that the generators of the cauchy horizon are focused at the late parts of the cauchy horizon @xcite .",
    "namely , the value of the area coordinate @xmath1 decreases slowly and monotonically along the cauchy horizon , until the cauchy horizon is completely focused , i.e. , the area coordinate shrinks to zero value at a finite value of the affine parameter along the cauchy horizon .",
    "then , the singularity becomes spacelike .",
    "( the spacelike singularity was first found numerically by gnedin and gnedin @xcite . )",
    "it is still an open question whether in a realistic spinning black hole perturbed non - linearly by a realistic physical field ( such as gravitational waves ) the generators of the cauchy horizon would also focus completely , and create a strong spacelike singularity . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the spacelike singularities inside spherical black holes ( both uncharged and charged ) , and study their properties under the simplifying assumptions of spherical symmetry and a minimally - coupled massless scalar field .",
    "we shall also assume homogeneity and power - law behavior of the metric functions , which are justified by recent numerical simulations .",
    "the spacelike singularity inside a spherically symmetric uncharged black hole perturbed by a scalar field was studied by doroshkevich and novikov @xcite , who treated the scalar field as a linear perturbation and obtained the general solution for the linear scalar field , but did not study the backreaction of the scalar field on the geometry .",
    "doroshkevich and novikov found that the scalar field diverges logarithmically with @xmath1 at the singularity .",
    "therefore , the energy density of the scalar field diverges like an inverse power of @xmath1 , and therefore , acting as a source term for the einstein - klein - gordon equations , the scalar field might be expected to change the metric functions .",
    "the very divergence of the linear perturbation analysis indicates that nonlinear effects are expected to be important .",
    "more recently , krori , goswami and das purkaystha @xcite considered the same problem as doroshkevich and novikov @xcite , but failed to obtain a general solution .",
    "the regular solution obtained by these authors depends on just one arbitrary parameter , while a general solution clearly depends on two independent arbitrary parameters ( see below ) .",
    "consequently , the correct conclusions to be drawn from a linear analysis are the conclusions of doroshkevich and novikov @xcite and not the conclusions of krori , goswami and das purkaystha @xcite . however , with the presence of an electric charge a linear perturbation analysis can not investigate a generic spacelike singularity , as this singularity is created by nonlinear effects , i.e. , by the nonlinear focusing of the generators of the cauchy horizon . under linear perturbations",
    "there would not exist inside a spherical charged black hole a spacelike singularity at all .",
    "therefore , to study the spacelike singularity inside a spherical charged black hole with a scalar field one has to consider the fully nonlinear case .",
    "nonlinear analysis of spacetime singularities with a scalar field in the cosmological case was done by belinskii and khalatnikov @xcite , who found that the scalar field destroys the bkl oscillations and that in that case the singularity is monotonic .",
    "( interestingly , belinskii and khalatnikov showed that if , in addition to the scalar field , there were also a vector field , the singularity would again be oscillatory .",
    "the analysis by belinskii and khalatnikov @xcite is markedly different from the analysis we shall present below , as we are interested here in spherical symmetry .",

    "we describe the physical model we employ . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss the properties of power - law spacelike singularities . in sections",
    "[ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] we study the cases of uncharged and charged spherical black holes , correspondingly .",
    "we show that indeed there exists a generic solution of the spherically symmetric coupled einstein - maxwell - klein - gordon equations with a spacelike singularity , with properties which one actually finds in numerical simulations .",
    "this result strengthens our confidence in the picture of black hole interiors as described above . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we analyze the strength of the singularity we find .",
    "we find that it is strong in the sense of tipler ( whereas the null cauchy horizon singularity is weak ) .",
    "we summarize and give some concluding remarks in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "we performed numerical simulations of the collapse of a spherically symmetric self - gravitating minimally coupled massless scalar field over a pre - existing reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "our code is based on free evolution and on double - null coordinates and is described at length in ref .",
    "the code is stable and converges with second order .",
    "the numerical set - up is described in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "prior to the initial hypersurface the geometry is reissner - nordstrm .",
    "then , at some advanced time @xmath2 the spacetime is perturbed by a high - amplitude self - gravitating spherical massless scalar field of squared - sine shape on the outgoing section of the initial hypersurface .",
    "the null coordinates we use in the numerical simulations are linear with the area coordinate @xmath1 on the initial hypersurface .",
    "this high amplitude scalar field increases the external mass of the black hole at late times by over @xmath3 .",
    "we then probe the metric functions and the scalar field in the black hole s interior along outgoing ( and ingoing ) null rays , approaching the spacelike singularity , which is located at some finite value of the ingoing null coordinate @xmath4 . here , @xmath5 is the value of the outgoing null ray @xmath6 at which our outgoing null ray is located .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows three such rays , denoted by 1,2 , and 3 .",
    "the metric we use for the numerics is @xmath7 the results we find numerically are as follow : first , the metric function @xmath8 vanishes at the singularity , and @xmath9 decays as a power - law with respect to the area coordinate @xmath1 as one gets closer to the singularity .",
    "in addition , we find that the area coordinate @xmath1 decays like a power of @xmath10 near the singularity .",
    "numerically , we find in all our simulations this power to be very close to @xmath11 , with a deviation of @xmath12 .",

    "our numerical results are described in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "these results are independent of the precise definition of the null coordinates we were using , as any regular gauge transformation which preserves the metric - form ( [ bur - met ] ) introduces just a multiplicative factor which does not change the power - law indices .",
    "in addition , we find similar results for all @xmath5 s .",
    "that is , the power with which @xmath9 decays to zero at the singularity depends on @xmath5 , but only weakly so .",
    "the power @xmath11 we found for @xmath14 is retained for all @xmath5 s .    7.0 cm    7.0 cm    therefore , we make the simplifying assumption of quasi homogeneity .",
    "namely , we assume that only derivatives of the metric functions and of the scalar field normal to the singularity are non - vanishing , while derivatives tangent to the singularity are exactly zero on it .",
    "we thus write the line - element as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the usual metric on the unit two - sphere . as",
    "the singularity is spacelike , and @xmath17 is the spacelike coordinate near the singularity and @xmath1 is timelike , we are going to neglect all derivatives with respect to @xmath17 , and keep only derivatives with respect to @xmath1 . with these assumptions",

    "we now denote by @xmath49 the coordinate tanget to the world line of an infalling observer . because the schwarzschild spacetime is vacuous , the projection of the ricci tensor on the world line is identically zero , i.e. , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the @xmath52 tetrad component of the ricci tensor .",
    "these results are independent of the mass @xmath53 of the schwarzschild black hole .",

    "the kasner solution with a spacelike parameter ( similar results are obtained also for the kasner solution with a timelike parameter ) is given by the metric @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "( this solution is anisotropic and is not spherically symmetric like the other solutions we consider in this paper . )    for the kasner solution one finds @xmath65 and @xmath66 this last result is obvious from the fact that the kasner solution represents a vacuum spacetime .      in all the above examples ,",
    "the kretschmann scalar diverges near the spacelike singularity like @xmath67 , and the ricci tensor , if spacetime is non - vacuum , diverges like @xmath68 . in this section",
    "we shall show that these results are general for any metric of the form ( [ bur - met1 ] ) .",
    "writing @xmath69 and @xmath70 , with @xmath71 being constants , a straightforward ( but lengthy ) calculation for the kretschmann scalar yields @xmath72 in schwarzschild , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "this result ( [ bur - kre ] ) is independent of @xmath71 .",
    "this is the analogue of the independence of the schwarzschild kretschmann scalar of the mass @xmath53 .",
    "one also finds that @xmath75 this result is of great importance , because one can show that if @xmath76 than a sufficient condition for the singularity to be strong in the sense of tipler is satisfied .",
    "a strong singularity in the sense of tipler can be defined as follows @xcite : let us consider non - spacelike geodesic running into the singularity . then",
    ", if the limit of the greatest lower bound of the volume element defined by the spatial metric induced by any three independent jacobi fields vanishes as one approaches the singularity along every such geodesic , then the singularity is strong in the sense of tipler .",
    "the physical content of this definition is that the volume of every extended physical object is compressed infinitely , such that every extended object will inevitably be crushed to zero volume .",
    "we note , that this is a ` strong ' definition for destructive singularities , as even weaker singularities would be strong enough to destroy any extended physical object .",
    "tipler @xcite gives an example for such a singularity , where the spatial metric induced by the jacobi fields behaves near the singularity like @xmath77 .",
    "the volume element defined by the spatial metric is unity , but any extended object would be infinitely stretched in one direction , and infinitely squeezed in two directions , in an infinite spaghettification .",
    "a theorem by clarke and krlak @xcite relates @xmath78 to the strength of the singularity : a sufficient condition for a singularity to be strong in the tipler sense is that the integral @xmath79 diverges at @xmath48 . for example , the frw cosmological model has a tipler strong singularity , as for this case this integral diverges logarithmically .",
    "note that this is a sufficient condition , but not a necessary condition : the schwarzschild and kasner singularities are tipler strong , but the integral vanishes identically by merit of their vacuous spacetimes .",
    "the important conclusion to be made here is as follows : for any non - vacuum homogeneous spacelike singularity near which the metric has the power - law form ( [ bur - met1 ] ) the singularity is strong in the tipler sense by virtue of the theorem by clarke and krlak and by eq .",

    "from the positivity of @xmath98 and @xmath99 it then follows that @xmath100 . in schwarzschild , @xmath101 , and",

    "however , there would also be situations with positive values for @xmath102 , and even @xmath104 as a special case .",

    "and therefore one needs to take @xmath108 where @xmath53 is the mass of the black hole , in order to recover in the limit of vanishing scalar field the schwarzschild solution .",
    "an important conclusion to be drawn from this solution is that @xmath13 . this can be shown as follows : for a general homogeneous metric ( [ bur - met1 ] ) we define a ` tortoise ' coordinate @xmath38 by @xmath109 .",

    "the solution is schwarzschild , where there is just one arbitrary parameter , by virtue of birkhoff s theorem .",
    "therefore , with the scalar field , we would expect one additional arbitrary parameter , i.e. , two arbitrary parameters .",
    "apparently , we have here three parameters .",
    "however , the arbitrariness in the fixing of @xmath99 is just a trivial gauge mode , related to the possibility to make an arbitrary transformation @xmath129 ( _ cf_. ref .",
    "@xcite for the analogue in schwarzschild ) .",
    "therefore , with a scalar field there are only two non - trivial arbitrary parameters , as should be expected .",
    "therefore , our solution has the right number of arbitrary parameters , and in this sense is generic .",
    "now , for a system of nonlinear equations the notion of a general solution is not unambiguous , and there may be other solutions of non - zero measure in solutions space , but our solution above also has a non - zero measure , and is therefore generic .",
    "we can now substitute our solution in the klein - gordon equation ( [ bur - kg ] ) , and obtain for the scalar field to the leading order in @xmath1 @xmath130 which diverges logarithmically like the linear scalar field studied by doroshkevich and novikov @xcite .",

    "can not be neglected , and the first order equations are dominated by the electric contribution . therefore , there is no smooth analytic limit for vanishing scalar field , and there is a discontinuity in the values that @xmath102 can take .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the causal structure of the singularity , which with a scalar field is spacelike and without a scalar field is timelike . with eqs .",
    "( [ bur - o15 ] ) and ( [ bur - o16 ] ) , the klein - gordon equation ( [ bur - kg ] ) yields for the scalar field again @xmath164 which is the same as @xmath165 for the uncharged case [ eq . ( [ bur - so11 ] ) ] . note that there is no value of @xmath102 which nullifies the scalar field in this case , as with vanishing scalar field there is no spacelike singularity like the singularity we are studying .",

    "( [ bur - e3 ] ) the error is @xmath168 .",
    "note the differences between these error estimates and their counterparts in the uncharged case .",
    "for each equation , the error estimate here has two terms , one of them does not depend on the charge , and the other does depend on it .",
    "the term which does not depend on the charge is the same as the error term in the uncharged case .",
    "however , the charge - dependent term has a smaller power index , and is therefore dominant .",
    "[ in the error for eq .",
    "( [ bur - e3 ] ) the term which does not depend on the charge vanishes . ]",
    "the difference in the power indices between the charge - dependent and the charge - independent terms is @xmath169 .",
    "we shall show below that this is an indication for a more complicated series form for the metric functions than the form we encountered in the uncharged case .",
    "the electric field does not contribute then to the leading order terms in the series expansion for the metric functions or the scalar field .",
    "however , we find that it does contribute to the second order terms . the equations which govern the second order terms are : @xmath170 @xmath171 where again @xmath137 and @xmath138 are known from the first order terms ( [ bur - o15 ] ) and ( [ bur - o16 ] ) , and where we again assumed a power - law behavior . these equations are different from their uncharged counterparts [ eqs .",
    "( [ bur - o21 ] ) and ( [ bur - o22 ] ) ] not only in the appearance of charge - dependent terms , but also in the absence of terms which appeared in the uncharged case .",
    "substitution of the power - law behavior ansatz yields @xmath172 @xmath173 such that @xmath174 @xmath175 and from the klein - gordon equation ( [ bur - kg ] ) @xmath176    the estimate for the leading terms in the errors associated with the second order terms are : for eq .",
    "( [ bur - e1 ] ) the error is @xmath177\\ ; ( b^3/d^6)\\;q^2\\;r^{3\\beta+2}+o(r^{3\\beta+4})$ ] , for eq .",

    "( [ bur - e3 ] ) the error is @xmath179\\;(b^3/d^4)\\;q^4\\;r^{3m-2 } + o(r^{4\\beta-2})$ ] .",
    "comparing these expressions for the errors associated with the second order expansions and the errors associated with the first - order expansions reveals that the effect of the second - order terms was to provide terms which balance the leading - order errors for the first - order expansions , and leave just the subsequent terms of the first - order expansions as the leading terms for the errors of the second - order expansions .",
    "namely , the contribution to the solution of each order balances the leading - order terms in the errors associated with the lower - order solution , and thus reduces the errors .",
    "one would be tempted to consider a series form similar to the series form we have for the uncharged case ( [ bur - se1 ] ) and ( [ bur - se2 ] ) .",
    "however , when one considers the third order terms for the metric functions @xmath180 and @xmath181 in the charged case one finds that this is impossible , unless the exact value of @xmath102 is known .",
    "a close inspection of our previous results and of the third order approximation shows that the increments in the power indices in the charged case are not equal .",
    "namely , the increment changes from @xmath102 to @xmath182 .",
    "therefore , it is more natural to seek a general solution in terms of a double series expansion than a single series . therefore , the solution will be of the form @xmath183 @xmath184 again , in order that eqs .",
    "( [ bur - se3 ] ) and ( [ bur - se4 ] ) would be a solution of the field equations ( [ bur - e1])([bur - e3 ] ) , the series should converge absolutely for some finite convergence interval , and the series expansion coefficients @xmath185 and @xmath186 should be found uniquely for each @xmath187 .",
    "in fact , the terms we previously found explicitly are nothing but the @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , @xmath191 terms in this double series expansion .",
    "it is still an open question whether the satisfaction of these two conditions can be proved rigorously .",
    "a similar double series expansion is also obtained for the scalar field , with the leading term diverging logarithmically .",
    "from the expression for the metric functions we found for the charged case we can calculate the leading term for the kretschmann scalar and for @xmath78 in terms of the proper time of an observer who follows a @xmath192 radial trajectory .",
    "we find that @xmath193 @xmath194 from eq .",
    "( [ bur - ricci ] ) and from the theorem by clarke and krlak @xcite it then follows that the spacelike singularity in spherical charged black holes with a self - gravitating scalar field is strong in the tipler sense .",
    "recall that the singularity we found is a generic one , in the sense that it relies on the correct number of arbitrary parameters .",
    "one indeed finds that these are the expressions which one obtains from the general expressions for power - law metrics ( [ bur - kre ] ) and ( [ bur - ric ] ) for this solution with @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "in addition , as in the charged case @xmath197 , it turns out that there is no special case which nullifies either of the curvature invariant @xmath198 or the second integral over @xmath199 .",
    "namely , for any choice of @xmath102 the spacelike singularity is strong in the tipler sense .",
    "( note that because of the inevitable presence of the scalar field for the singularity to be spacelike with electric charge , there is no vacuum solution , and therefore the ricci tensor does not vanish . )",
    "we found a generic solution for a spacelike singularity for the spherically symmetric einstein - maxwell - scalar field equations , which was previously found numerically in scalar - field collapse simulations .",
    "the generic singularity we found has the same properties as the singularity which arises in the numerical simulations .",
    "the singularity we found was obtained under the assumption of quasi - homogeneity , namely , that the metric functions do not depend on derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinates ( in our case , because of the spherical symmetry , this means that there is no dependence on @xmath17 ) .",
    "namely , we sought a velocity - dominated singularity .",
    "the next obvious step in the analysis of the singularity would be to relax the homogeneity assumption .",
    "this could perhaps be done by allowing the arbitrary parameters in the solution to be functions of @xmath17 .",
    "namely , all we need to do is to make the transformation @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 for the leading order terms of the solution .",
    "the higher - order terms will have to be corrected for the terms with dependence on derivatives with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "( because of the spherical symmetry there would still not be derivatives with respect to the angular coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath22 . )",
    "a preliminary check shows that these leading terms indeed satisfy the full spherically - symmetric einstein - maxwell - scalar field equations , with error smaller than the leading terms .",
    "however , it is still needed to perform a fuller analysis of the higher - order contributions .",
    "then , the solution would be inhomogeneous , and depend on three arbitrary functions , and in this sense would be a generic solution .",
    "the homogeneous solution is then nothing but the pointwise behavior of the inhomogeneous solution .",
    "however , it is still to be shown that this inhomogeneous solution really solves the inhomogeneous einstein - maxwell - scalar field equations .",
    "special attention is required in order to analyze to behavior of the fields near the spacetime event corresponding to the change of the causal structure of the singularity , namely to the event where the null singularity becomes spacelike .",
    "there are two possibilities to approach this spacetime event numerically , using a double - null code such as ours .",
    "first , one could approach this event along an outgoing null rays . then one would need to reduce the value of the outgoing null coordinate @xmath6 , and compare the values of the fields approaching the singularity along various values of @xmath6 .",
    "second , one could also study the singularity along ingoing null rays .",
    "late - time ingoing null rays actually probe the null mass - inflation singularity .",
    "however , one can also focus attention to the deep portions of these rays , and thus study the nearly - complete focusing domain , where the value of @xmath1 is very small .",
    "we find numerically that the area coordinate @xmath1 continues to decrease monotonically even at the nearly - complete focusing domain .",
    "this second approach would be more natural with a sleight variation of the numerical code : the integration is normally carried out in our code along ingoing rays , namely , we intergate from the initial data on an ingoing ray and the data on the first grid - point on the next ingoing ray , the fields throughout this second ray , and so on ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however ,",
    "for this second approach to the special event where the causal structure of the singularity changes , one could benefit from changing the direction of integration , and integrate along _ outgoing _ null rays instead of ingoing rays . then , for each value of advanced time @xmath203 for a certain ingoing null ray one would eventually approach the spacelike singularity for large @xmath6 , and the later @xmath203 , the closer one would be the the spacetime event under consideration .",
    "we again stress that it is still an open question whether in a more realistic model our results would be preserved .",
    "namely , a scalar field was introduced as a toy model for a physical field because it has a radiative mode in spherical symmetry . however , a scalar field is not a realistic physical field , and it is possible that more realistic fields will not create a spacelike singularity . it has been shown before that scalar fields create unique phenomena ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and therefore it is not impossible that the generic spacelike singularity we found is just an artifact of an over - simplified toy model .",
    "in addition , a realistic black hole will not be spherically symmetric , and whether a spacelike singularity would be created inside spinning black holes is a question still awaiting investigations .",
