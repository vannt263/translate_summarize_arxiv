    "the uvcs / soho observations of plasma properties in the polar coronal holes ( pch ) revealed the existence of preferential ion heating with @xmath1 ( kohl et al .",
    ", 1997a ; 1998 ) .",
    "ion to proton kinetic temperature ratios are significantly higher than the ion to proton mass ratios , i.e. @xmath2 ( kohl et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the uvcs measurements on pch also provided clear signatures of temperature anisotropies , with the temperature perpendicular to the magnetic field being much larger than the temperature parallel to the field .",
    "the temperature anisotropy , for example , is found to be @xmath3 for o vi ions ( kohl et al . , 1997b ; 1998 ; cranmer et al .",
    "these observations led to widespread interest in theoretical models of ion - cyclotron resonance ( icr ) , because this mechanism naturally produces preferential heating and temperature anisotropies ( e.g. dusenbery and hollweg , 1981 ; cranmer , 2001 ; isenberg and vasquez , 2009 ) .",
    "the icr mechanism is a classical wave - particle interaction between the left - hand polarized ion - cyclotron / alfv@xmath4n waves and the positive ions gyrating around the background magnetic field lines .",
    "resonance occurs when the doppler - shifted wave frequency and the ion cyclotron frequency are equal . when the resonance condition is met , the electric field oscillations of the wave are no longer felt \" by the ion .",
    "therefore , the ion sees a constant electric field and can efficiently absorb energy from the wave depending on the relative phase between its own velocity vector and the electric field vector of the wave .",
    "the resulting effect of this process is to increase the perpendicular velocity of the ion ( isenberg and vasquez , 2009 ; cranmer 2009 ) .",
    "ions with higher perpendicular energy diffuse into wider larmor orbits .",
    "the preferential perpendicular heating indicated by uvcs measurements naturally leads to a preferential acceleration since the ions having greater perpendicular velocities experience a higher mirror force , @xmath5\\nabla b $ ] , in the radially decreasing magnetic field of the coronal hole .    in a series of papers by hollweg ( 1999a , b ,",
    "c ) the authors investigated the resonant interactions with ion - cyclotron waves in coronal holes in detail .",
    "besides , hollweg and markovskii ( 2002 ) offered a physical discussion of how the cyclotron resonances behave when the waves propagate obliquely to the magnetic field .",
    "vocks and marsch ( 2002 ) described a kinetic model which is based on wave - particle interactions .",
    "their model successfully explains the preferential heating of heavy ions and the temperature anisotropies .",
    "cranmer ( 2000 ) investigated the dissipation of ion - cyclotron resonant waves by taking more than 2000 ion species into account and showed the effective damping ability of the minor ions .",
    "there are also a number of theoretical models which are based on fluid or magnetohydrodynamic approaches to the coronal heating and the solar wind acceleration ( e.g. tu and marsch , 1997 ; suzuki and inutsuka , 2006 ; matsumoto and suzuki , 2012 ) .",
    "the suggested fluid models can successfully produce the required energy flux density to heat the coronal holes without resonant interactions .",
    "however , the kinetic approach has an advantage of distinguishing the plasma particles in a more definitive way in accordance with the collisionless nature of pch ( cranmer , 2009 ) .",
    "a kinetic description is required in order to account fully for the observed microscopic details of the solar wind plasma ( marsch , 1991 ) .",
    "since the icr process successfully explains the details revealed by the observations , i.e. the presence of temperature anisotropy of minor ion species and preferential heating , it has been proposed as the most favourable heating mechanism of the solar corona .    over the last few years",
    ", there has been an enormous increase in the number of observations on ubiquitous waves in the solar corona .",
    "tomczyk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) detected mhd waves by using coronal multi - channel polarimeter ( comp ) .",
    "their estimate of the energy carried by the spatially resolved waves indicates that the waves are too weak to heat the solar corona ; however they also proposed that the unresolved mhd waves can carry enough energy to heat the corona . recently ,",
    "mcintosh et al . ( 2011 ) measured the amplitudes , periods and phase speeds of outward - propagating alfvnic motions in the transition region and the corona .",
    "they reported that the observed waves are energetic enough to accelerate the fast solar wind and heat the quiet corona . besides , the observations of hahn et al .",
    "( 2012 ) provide a new evidence of wave damping at unexpectedly low heights in a polar coronal hole ( pch ) .",
    "they estimate that the dissipated energy may account for a large fraction ( up to about 70% ) of that required to heat the coronal hole and accelerate the fast solar wind .",
    "in doan & peknl ( 2012 , hereafter paper i ) we studied the effect of the plume and interplume lanes ( pipl ) of pchs on the interaction between the o vi ions and the ion - cyclotron waves ( icws ) . in paper",
    "i as well as in the present one , the gradients of number density and temperature along and perpendicular to the magnetic field lines were considered .",
    "it was shown in paper i that the resonance process in the interplume lanes is much more effective than in the plumes .",
    "nevertheless , we should mention that more efficient dissipation may not necessarily lead to a higher wind flow .",
    "it is discussed by some authors that a stronger heating rate is required to produce the denser wind flows in the plume regions where the bulk speed is observed to be slower ( see e.g. wang , 1994 ; pinto et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the present investigation is the extension of paper i wherein we assumed that o vi ions have a bi - maxwellian velocity distribution function in pchs . in this study",
    ", we assume that the streaming bi - maxwellian velocity distribution function for o vi ions would be physically more realistic than that of bi - maxwellian , since the former will take into consideration the bulk velocity of the solar wind .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we briefly summarize the plasma properties of the pchs and obtain the dispersion relation of the icws solving the vlasov equation for o vi ions .",
    "we also compare the new results with those found in paper i. we present our conclusions in section 3 .",
    "properties of the pch plasma were explained in paper i in greater detail ( see section 2 of paper i and references therein ) . here , we only summarize the radial dependences of effective temperature , number density , the pch magnetic field and the bulk velocity of o vi ions , respectively . by using the empirical model of cranmer et al .",

    "the magnetic field profiles of verdini et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and hollweg ( 1999a ) overlap quite a lot with appropriate values of free parameters .",

    "the number densities of electrons in plumes appear to be 10% higher than that of interplume lanes ( kohl et al . , 1997a ) .",

    "knowledge of the perturbed velocity in terms of the first - order electric field allows us to calculate the current density and the dielectric tensor .",

    "the refractive index is , on average , * 3 * times higher than those found in paper i. including the bulk velocity of the solar wind clearly increases the value of the refractive index .",
    "this result again implies that the phase velocity of the icws becomes slower when the bulk velocity is taken into consideration . besides",

    "the wavenumbers of icws for a streaming bi - maxwellian velocity distribution is found to be 1.5 - 3 times higher than that of the bi - maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "since the wave frequency we assumed , i.e. 2500 @xmath51 , is the same in both investigation , the higher wavenumber implies that the phase velocity of the icws becomes slower when the bulk velocity is taken into consideration .",

    "the refractive index is 2.5 times higher in interplume lanes than the one in plume lanes .",
    "this ratio is slightly higher than we found for the bi - maxwellian distribution assumption .",
    "higher refractive index may imply that the resonance process is more effective in interplume regions .",
    "however , it is yet to be discussed whether a stronger heating is needed in order to produce faster flows of the interplume lanes ( see pinto et al .",
    "if more efficient resonance process means a higher wind speed , than our result is consistent with the observations which reveal that the source of the fast solar wind is interplume lanes .",
    "let us suppose that an o vi ion resonates with a wave of a certain frequency , gains energy and escapes from the potential well of the wave .",
    "if there is a wave with a higher frequency in the surrounding , o vi ions come into resonance with it too and acquire more energy . in order stochastic acceleration",
    "to come about there should be a wide band of waves in pchs .",

    "those particles the velocity of which are equal to the phase velocity ( @xmath63 ) are readily trapped in the potential wells of the waves .",
    "particles with velocities slightly higher than the phase velocity of the wave attempt to escape from the potential well of the wave , fail in this attempt fall back and set in a oscillatory motion in the potential well .",
    "these kind of particles , because of their initial velocity were higher than the phase velocity of the wave , becomes slower and on the average give up part of their energy to the wave and cause the amplitude of the wave grow .",
    "on the other hand , the o vi ions with velocities slower than the phase velocity of the wave acquire acceleration , gain energy at the expense of the wave energy .    if the streaming bi - maxwellian velocity distribution function has a negative slope then the number of particles causing the wave damping is greater than the number of particles causing the wave growth . in this case , the net effect of the icr process is the transfer of energy from icws to o vi ions .",
