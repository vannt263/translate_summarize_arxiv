    "isospin violating decays into three pions are two of the most probable @xmath1 meson decay modes : @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it appears that contribution of electromagnetic processes is suppressed @xcite and the decays are driven by an isospin violating term of the qcd lagrangian proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the partial width of the @xmath8 decay calculated using current algebra ( pcac ) is 66 ev @xcite , much below the experimental value 294@xmath916 ev @xcite .",
    "second order contributions in the low energy expansion of the qcd lagrangian ( chiral perturbation theory  chpt ) were calculated by gasser and leutwyler increasing the result to 160 ev @xcite .",
    "the big change with respect to the first order calculations implies the importance of @xmath10 interaction in the final state .",
    "an elegant method of including the interaction up to higher orders is provided by dispersion relations .",
    "there are two calculations using this technique @xcite but employing different formalism .",
    "they lead consistently to an enhancement of the decay rate by about 14% .",
    "a free parameter in this approach is the value of the so called _ subtraction point _ and it was constrained using chpt calculations .",
    "normally the calculations of @xmath15 are performed using the dashen theorem @xcite where @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath15 is sensitive to the exact value of @xmath13 , it was suggested that the decay might provide precise constrain for the light quark mass ratios @xcite .",
    "namely @xmath13 determines the major axis of the ellipse in the @xmath17 , @xmath18 plane .",
    "one important prerequisite is the reliability of the @xmath19 calculations .",
    "the calculations can be tested by comparing the ratio @xmath20 and the density distributions in the respective dalitz plots with experiment .",
    "recently @xmath13 was derived from preliminary kloe data on @xmath21 decay @xcite , by determining the subtraction point within the dispersion relation approach of @xcite , yielding a @xmath13 value 22.1 @xcite .",
    "this letter describes an exclusive measurement of kinematical distributions of the @xmath0 s from the @xmath22 channel .",
    "the phase space of the decay can be represented by a dalitz plot employing symmetrized variables as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dalitzplot](left ) .",
    "the amplitude can then be expressed in terms of polar coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where due to symmetry @xmath24 is restricted to @xmath25 . instead of @xmath23 a normalized dimensionless variable @xmath26",
    "is used : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is kinetic energy of a @xmath0 in the @xmath1 rest frame and @xmath29 is the average kinetic energy .",
    "the situation for the @xmath3 measurement is unsettled with inconsistent experimental results and disagreement with chpt predictions ( table  [ tab : table2 ] ) .",
    "in lowest order chpt @xmath32 .",
    "the deviation is caused by the @xmath33 interactions .",
    "all calculations beyond one loop predict a negative value of @xmath3 .",
    "dispersion relations @xcite and u(3 ) chiral effective field theory with rescattering @xcite give consistently a low value for the @xmath34 of about 0.007 .",
    "most recent calculations with u(3 ) effective lagrangian and bethe - salpeter equations include more general rescattering graphs and parameters are fitted to the scattering data for the pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .",
    "the calculations are able to explain the large experimental values for @xmath34 .",
    "however in that approach a change of the @xmath13 value can be compensated by other fit parameters and could even be equal to @xmath35 .",
    "a special feature of the @xmath36 decay is that the physical region extends below threshold of the @xmath37 reaction .",
    "therefore a cusp structure should be visible in invariant mass distribution of two @xmath38 around @xmath39 ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dalitzplot](left ) ) , in analogy to the recent observation in @xmath40 decay @xcite .",
    "the exact parameters of the cusp in the @xmath40 decay provide one of most precise determinations of the @xmath10 scattering length ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the acceptance corrected @xmath43 dependence on the @xmath30 variable is obtained by dividing the measured distribution by the mc prediction with @xmath3 set to 0 .",
    "a fit of the function ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) is performed to extract the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the mc data are normalized to obtain @xmath44 . for the final result @xmath45 the first bin was excluded due to large systematic uncertainty and the last bin due to low statistics .",
    "the estimate of the systematic errors is obtained by variation of all essential cuts applied in the reconstruction : @xmath46 for the kinematic fit , the combinatorial purity of the sample , the missing mass and the @xmath30 range . for each subsample a fit to @xmath3 was performed : an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : partialslopes ] and the summary is given in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the overall systematical error was obtained by comparing central values of the fits for the subsamples and it takes into account the influence of the first bin for the @xmath3 value  @xcite .",
    "we have also performed a search for a cusp structure in the invariant mass distribution of the two @xmath47 ( fig .  [ fig : cusp ] ) .",
    "an eventual observation would require at least two orders of magnitude larger data sample .",
    "the presented result for @xmath3 is limited by the available statistics which determines also attainable systematical accuracy ( due to the size of the subsamples used for the tests ) . within the errors",
    "it is compatible both with the result from crystal ball @xcite , based on 10@xmath48 events , and with the preliminary kloe result @xcite listed in table  [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "the reconstruction methods developed for the purpose of this experiment are now being used in analysis of recently collected data from the followup experiment with wasa detector located at cosy ring ( fz juelich ) @xcite with much larger statistics .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the support of the personnel at the svedberg laboratory throughout this experiment .",
