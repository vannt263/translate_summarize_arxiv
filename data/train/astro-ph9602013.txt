    "clusters of galaxies provide a powerful probe of the nature of galaxy formation and the origin of large scale structure in the universe . having a well - studied sample of intermediate and high - redshift clusters is vital to understanding the evolution of galaxies and large scale structure . because the diversity of cluster properties and the effects of evolution are significant at high redshift ( gunn & dressler 1988 ; bower et al .",

    "1994 ; postman et al . 1996 ) , it is essential to sample many distant clusters with different properties .",
    "large scale simulations have shown that cluster properties such as profile shape and substructure can constrain the nature of large scale structure formation theories and the mass density of the universe ( evrard et al .",

    "all four clusters show moderate to extreme degrees of structure .",
    "however , the distribution of structure in mass , light , and x - rays are all well correlated at radii larger than @xmath10 . the projected mass density ( and light ) profile of a1689",
    "can be well approximated by a power - law of @xmath11 , while the projected total mass , gas , and light surface densities of a2218 are consistent with an isothermal sphere ( @xmath12 ) , though perhaps slightly steeper .",

    ", we expand on these detailed analyses of individual intermediate redshift clusters by studying a large sample of intermediate and high redshift clusters from the palomar distant cluster survey ( hereafter pdcs ; postman et al .",
    "we examine both the individual and global properties of the cluster profiles , specifically the cluster profile slope , core radius , and degree of asymmetry .",
    "because the pdcs uses a completely objective and automated algorithm to detect clusters , it provides us with the largest , statistically complete sample of distant clusters .",
    "in addition , the selection biases due to the detection technique can be well quantified through simple monte - carlo simulations .    in  2 of this paper",
    "we briefly describe the pdcs and the cluster sample used in this analysis .",
    "the parameters of the individual cluster profiles are discussed in  3 .",
    "composite cluster profiles as a function of redshift are presented in  4 .",
    "cluster morphology is discussed in  5 .",
    "we present a preliminary comparison of our results to large - scale cosmological simulations in  6 and summarize the results in  7 .",
    "the cluster sample is derived from an optical / near ir survey with the 4-shooter ccd camera on the palomar 5 meter telescope .",
    "the cluster catalog is the subject of the first paper in this series ( postman et al .",
    "1996 ; hereafter paper i ) . however , we discuss briefly the aspects of this catalog which are necessary for the following analysis .",
    "the palomar distant cluster survey was conducted in two broad band filters , the f555w and f785lp of hst s wide field / planetary camera .",
    "we denote these bands 4 ( f555w ) and i4 ( f785lp ) according to the convention in paper i. the area covered consists of five one  square degree areas around the sky , all at galactic latitudes of 30 degrees or greater .",
    "the data are complete to 4 @xmath19 and i4 @xmath20 .",
    "a matched filter algorithm was used to objectively identify the cluster candidates by using positional and photometric data simultaneously .",
    "this technique is likely to be more robust than previous optical selections which simply looked for surface density enhancements , a method which can be significantly affected by superposition effects ( _ e.g. , _",
    "gunn , hoessel & oke 1986 ; couch et al .",
    "an advantage of this technique is that redshift estimates of the cluster candidates are produced as a byproduct of the matched filter ; the main disadvantage is that we must assume a particular form for the cluster luminosity function ( for the flux filter ) and cluster radial profile ( for the radial filter ) .",
    "the radial filter @xmath21 and the flux filter @xmath22 are given by    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath21 is an azimuthally symmetric cluster surface density profile which has a characteristic core radius ( @xmath25 ) and which falls off at large radii as @xmath12 .",
    "the function is explicitly cut off at an arbitrary cutoff radius ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we have chosen @xmath27 and @xmath28 such that the radial profile resembles the profiles of nearby clusters and that we have optimized the cluster detections relative to the spurious detection rates ( paper i ) .",
    "@xmath29 is the differential schechter luminosity function with @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the 4 and i4 bands , respectively ; @xmath33 is the background galaxy counts . for the derivation of these filters and a detailed explanation ,",
    "see paper i. we have used extensive simulations in both paper i and this paper to quantify the selection bias due to the functional form of the matched filter .",
    "we find that this selection bias has a minimal effect on the resulting distribution of profiles .",
    "the matched filter algorithm does a good job at preserving the true distribution of profile shapes for a broad range of cluster profile parameters .",
    "candidate clusters are detected individually in each band and then matched with each other to locate those systems which are detected in both bands .",
    "the catalog consists of 79 clusters of galaxies detected with estimated redshifts between @xmath34 and 1.2 ; the uncertainty in the estimated redshift ( @xmath35 ) is @xmath36 ( see paper i ; lubin 1995 ) .",
    "87% of the cluster candidates are matched detections ( detected in both the 4 and i4 bands ) .",
    "the amplitude of the matched filter provides an estimate of the cluster richness .",
    "this filter richness ( @xmath37 ) is a measure of the effective number of @xmath38 galaxies in the cluster ( see  4.2.2 of paper i ; lubin 1995 ) . through monte - carlo simulations",
    ", we can statistically determine the relation between @xmath37 and the actual cluster richness as determined by the specification of abell ( 1958 ) .",
    "this relation is dependent on profile shape ; as the cluster profile slope steepens , a given @xmath37 value corresponds to a _",
    "lower _ richness class . for a cluster which has a surface density profile of approximately @xmath12 ( the assumed profile of the radial filter )",
    ", @xmath39 corresponds to abell @xmath40 ( paper i ) .",
    "therefore , in the analysis which follows , we will examine only those clusters with @xmath41 . the cluster sample that will be the subject of this paper consists of 57 clusters in the 4 band and 50 clusters in the i4 band .",
    "table 1 lists the i d number of these clusters ( according to the convention of paper i ) .",
    "we begin by examining the individual profiles in the 4 and i4 bands .",
    "we have an estimate of the cluster redshift ( @xmath35 ) and the cluster center from the matched filter detection algorithm .",
    "the cluster center is taken to be the position of the _ peak _ cluster signal for each detection ( see paper i ) .",
    "surface density profiles of each cluster candidate are computed by counting the number of galaxies in successive annuli around the center of each cluster .",
    "we bin out to a given _ physical _ radius of @xmath42 mpc ( assuming @xmath43 ) at the estimated redshift of the cluster .",
    "twenty bins of equal radial extent are used . the uncertainty in each bin",
    "is calculated from poisson statistics .",
    "an annulus of radii @xmath44 around each cluster is used to measure directly the background level for each cluster .",
    "the measured background varies @xmath45 from cluster to cluster and field to field . as an example , at a redshift of @xmath46 , the number of cluster members ( out to a radius of @xmath47 ) in a @xmath48 cluster is @xmath49 galaxies or 10  20% of the total number of galaxies in that region .",
    "we quantify the slope at large radii ( described by a power - law exponent @xmath50 ) and the cluster core radius ( @xmath25 ) of the cluster profile by fitting each resulting background - subtracted surface density profile to a king model ( king 1962 ; cavaliere & fusco  femiano 1976 ; sarazin & bahcall 1977 ) :    @xmath51^{{-3 \\beta + 1}\\over 2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 and @xmath25 are the normalization and core radius of the king model , respectively .",

    "the average @xmath56 single parameter errors ( avni 1976 ) in the fit parameters of an _ individual _ cluster profile are @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( _ e.g. , _ see table 3 ) .",
    "we are able to constrain the slope of the surface density profile much more accurately than the cluster core radius ( see also  3.2 ) . as a consistency check ,",
    "we have examined the effect on the profile fittings by ( 1 ) calculating the cluster background at a larger limiting radius ; ( 2 ) changing the bin size ( by @xmath59 ) ; and ( 3 ) using the _ weighted _ center rather than the peak center of each cluster ( where the weighted center is defined as the mean position as weighted by the amplitude of the matched filter signal within the cluster detection ; see also  5 ) ; the cluster fit parameters are all consistent within the measurement error with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the variation in the cluster profile parameters is large , as is the sensitivity to the background level .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to say anything quantitative on an individual basis ( see also  4 ) .",
    "table 2 lists the median values and `` @xmath62 '' confidence interval for the _ distribution _ of @xmath50 and @xmath25 in each band .",
    "we define a @xmath62 confidence interval around each parameter by determining the points in the distribution such that the area in each tail is 16% .",
    "the average pdcs cluster has a surface density slope of @xmath63 and core radius of @xmath64 .",
    "note that the distribution of core radii in the palomar clusters indicates that approximately 20  30% of the clusters have very small or essentially no core radii ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the median values in the 4 and i4 bands are consistent with each other ( table 2 ) .",
    "the observed range in @xmath50 is completely consistent with a sample of nearby , rich clusters ( @xmath65 ; bahcall 1977 ; see also beers & tonry 1986 ; oegerle 1985 ; postman , geller & huchra 1988 ) , the galaxy  cluster cross correlation function which represents the _ average _ net galaxy density profile around rich clusters ( @xmath66 ; seldner & peebles 1977 ; peebles 1980 ; lilje & efstathiou 1988 ) , and measures of the mass ( and light ) distribution of intermediate redshift clusters ( smail et al . 1995 ; tyson & fischer 1995 ; squires 1995 ) .",
    "the range of core radii of the pdcs clusters is also typical of other well - studied nearby and intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "a study of 15 rich , nearby clusters yields core radii of @xmath67 ( bahcall 1975 ; though a similar study of 12 clusters by dressler 1978 indicate core radii larger by a factor of @xmath68 ) .",
    "smail et al .",
    "( 1995 ) examined the core radii of two intermediate redshift , x - ray luminous clusters and found @xmath69 for 1455 + 22 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath70 for 0016 + 16 ( @xmath7 ) , while molinari et al .",

    "2 , we show the cluster profiles for three matched pdcs cluster candidates ( cluster i d # 003 , 036 and 059 ; paper i ) . in order to show the diversity of the pdcs clusters , we have chosen clusters which cover a range in estimated redshifts ( @xmath35 ) and profile shape .",
    "table 3 lists the relevant parameters of the fittings to these cluster profiles .      in order to estimate the measurement error and to demonstrate that the matched filter does not significantly bias the profile distribution ,",
    "we have performed simple monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we estimate the errors in our fitting procedure and evaluate the selection function by running the cluster finding algorithm on artificial fields which match , as closely as possible , the galaxy and cluster distributions of the actual pdcs fields .",
    "we reproduce our matching criteria in the cluster detection method by creating ten pairs of galaxy fields , each 1 @xmath73 , as viewed through the 4 and i4 passbands .",
    "we accomplished this by first modeling the actual background density ",
    "magnitude function of regions of the pdcs fields which contain no detected clusters . for each simulated field",
    ", we randomly distribute the appropriate number of background galaxies in each magnitude bin according to this function . on top of this uniform field , we superimpose 25 simulated clusters with the condition that the separation between clusters must be greater than 500 arcsec .",
    "the clusters are randomly given redshifts between 0.2 and 1.2 ( in @xmath74 increments of 0.1 ) and richnesses of @xmath75 .",
    "the only restriction placed on cluster richness is that clusters at @xmath76 can not be richer than richness class 2 and clusters at @xmath77 can not be poorer than richness class 1 .",
    "we have chosen for the cluster luminosity function the same schechter function as the matched filter ; however , we assume that half of the clusters contain spirals ( and apply a scd spiral k  correction ) and half contain ellipticals ( and apply an elliptical k  correction ) .",
    "the k  correction will affect the redshift estimate of the cluster ( @xmath78 ) but not the richness estimate @xmath37 ( lubin 1995 ; paper i ) .",
    "firstly , we estimate the _ measurement _ error inherent in our fitting procedure by simulating a population of clusters with a _ unique _ surface density slope ( @xmath50 ) and core radius ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we choose the average profile parameters observed in the pdcs : @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the cluster galaxies are distributed in an azimuthally symmetric manner according to the appropriate king profile ( eq .  3 ) .",
    "we apply the same detection criteria and richness cut ( @xmath41 ) to the simulated clusters as for the pdcs clusters . for each simulated cluster ,",
    "a surface density profile is created and then fit to the king model in the manner described in  3.1 .",
    "the resulting distributions of fit parameters for 20 simulated clusters are shown in fig .",
    "the median values and their @xmath62 errors ( as defined in  3.1 ) of these distributions are listed in table 4 .",
    "median _ values of the distributions of fit parameters reproduce well the actual input parameters of the simulated clusters ; however , the distributions are artifically broadened by @xmath81 in @xmath50 and @xmath82 in @xmath25 . these errors",
    "are due to uncertainties , most notably background subtraction , associated with the fitting procedure ; in addition , errors in the estimated redshift contribute to the broad width of the @xmath25 distribution .",
    "the measurement uncertainties associated with this particular cluster population are typical of the errors for cluster populations with other combinations of @xmath50 and @xmath25 .",
    "secondly , we examine the selection bias of the radial filter ( @xmath83 ) by exploring a broad range in cluster shape through two profile distributions . in the first set of simulations ,",
    "we generate a gaussian distribution of profile shapes which is reasonably close to that observed in the pdcs ( table 2 ) ; the simulated clusters have a surface density slope distribution of @xmath84 and a core radius distribution of @xmath85 . in the second set of simulations ,",
    "we generate a gaussian distribution of profile shapes which is very different from the pdcs , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "4 shows the input parameter distributions ( shaded histograms ) of the simulated clusters and the output parameter distributions ( solid line histograms ) of those clusters detected by the algorithm .",
    "there appears to be _ no _ significant selection bias in either of the two simulated cluster populations due to the matched filter ; we reproduce the input distributions of @xmath50 and @xmath25 over this broad range of cluster parameters extremely well .",
    "as noted in paper i , clusters with steeper profiles yield the strongest matched filter signal",
    ". this will affect the cluster detection probability , though the exact effect is also dependent on the cluster core radius and the cluster richness .",
    "however , we have shown with the simulations of this section that , for reasonable choices of the input cluster distribution ( that is , distributions with standard deviations typical of that observed in the pdcs ) , the matched filter does not significantly bias the detected ( output ) parameter distribution .",
    "we have quantified both the measurement error associated with the profile fitting procedure , as well as the selection bias associated with the functional form of the matched filter .",
    "the observed median parameters of the pdcs profile distributions appear to provide an accurate indication of the true parent population of cluster shapes .",
    "we can also estimate the slope of the cluster surface density profiles by examining the relation between richness ( @xmath88 ) and central density ( @xmath89 ) of the individual clusters . similarly to abell ( 1958 ) , central density and richness are defined as the number of member galaxies ( above background ) that are brighter than @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 is the magnitude of the third brightest galaxy ) and located within a projected radius of @xmath92 and @xmath47 , respectively ( see  4.2.3 of paper i for details ) . fig .",
    "5 shows @xmath93 versus @xmath94 for the pdcs clusters in the two passbands ( top panels ) .",
    "the median values of @xmath95 are @xmath96 ( 4 band ) and @xmath97 ( i4 band ) .",
    "the standard deviation in these distributions represent @xmath62 confidence intervals as defined in  3.1 .",
    "the expected relation between richness and central density for the simulated cluster population described in  3.2 ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) is shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "the median values of @xmath95 are @xmath100 ( 4 band ) and @xmath101 ( i4 band ) , consistent with those of the pdcs .",
    "we note that the relation between @xmath93 and @xmath94 for a population of clusters with a much _ steeper _ surface density profile ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath102 ; @xmath103 ) is inconsistent with that observed in the pdcs ; the probability , as measured by the ks test , that the pdcs distribution is drawn from the same parent population as the @xmath95 distribution of an @xmath102 cluster population is @xmath104 .",
    "in an effort to improve our constraints on the cluster profiles , we explore the average profile shape , specifically the surface density slope @xmath50 , as a function of redshift by creating global composites of our sample of pdcs clusters .",
    "because we exclusively use estimated redshifts ( observed redshifts are presently available for fewer than 10 pdcs clusters ) whose uncertainty are estimated at @xmath78 ( see  4.2.1 of paper i ) , we sort each cluster by its estimated redshift ( @xmath35 ) in 4 and i4 bands into three broad redshift ranges : ( 1 ) @xmath105 , ( 2 ) @xmath106 , and ( 3 ) @xmath107 .",
    "we examine the cluster profile at @xmath2 by creating a composite cluster profile .",
    "we logarithmically bin galaxies in the radial range @xmath108 around each cluster center with a bin width of 0.1 in log @xmath109 ( i.e. 10 bins ) .",
    "the background level determined for each individual cluster profile ( from an outer annulus ; see  3.1 ) is first subtracted .",
    "we stack the cluster profiles in each redshift interval according to their physical radius ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the resulting composite cluster profiles are then fit to a power - law of the form @xmath110 .",
    "the composite profiles of the pdcs in the 4 and i4 bands are shown in fig .",
    "the redshift range is indicated in the upper right - hand corner of each panel .",
    "the error in the mean value is determined from the variance in each radius bin .",
    "the solid line indicates the best - fit power - law function .",
    "table 5 lists the number of cluster profiles used to make the composite , the best - fit power - law slopes @xmath50 , and their @xmath62 single parameter errors .",
    "these errors are calculated according to the procedure described by avni ( 1976 ) who presents the correct `` minimum @xmath111 '' method for calculating confidence limits in a fitting with one `` interesting parameter '' ( i.e. @xmath50 ) .",
    "the slopes of the composite profiles are consistent with the results of the individual fittings ( table 6 ) .",
    "the surface density slopes of the most distant clusters ( @xmath112 ) are slightly steeper than their intermediate redshift counterparts .",
    "this may simply reflect the larger uncertainty in the fitted parameters when co - adding such a small number of clusters ( 9 in 4 band and 5 in i4 band in this redshift interval ) .",
    "such a large dispersion is also seen in the simulations when co - adding a similar number of high redshift clusters .",
    "in addition , it may be the result of a bias due to the inherent difficulty in subtracting an appropriate background for clusters at very large redshift .",
    "nonetheless , some evolution in the cluster profile is expected for certain cosmologies ( see  6 ) .    since richer clusters are believed to have formed at earlier epochs ( peebles 1993 )",
    ", we may expect to see a variation in profile shape with richness .",
    "we , therefore , examine the composite cluster profiles of a richer subset ( @xmath113 ) of the pdcs clusters .",
    "we find that , within the observational uncertainty , there is no difference between the power - law slopes of the composites of this richer population and the composite profiles presented in fig .",
    "6 .      in order to demonstrate that the composite profiles are not being biased by a few clusters",
    ", we performed a parametric bootstrap analysis ( see kendall & stuart 1967 ) .",
    "this technique involves randomly drawing a new sample ( of equal number ) from the original cluster sample . from each new sample , we create a composite cluster profile as described above and fit the power - law function .",
    "this procedure was performed on 50 resampled datasets .",
    "the average ( and standard deviation ) of the resulting @xmath50 values are completely consistent ( within @xmath62 ) with the fits to the original true composite in all three redshift intervals ( table 5 ) .",
    "we confirm that our technique for creating cluster composites is not biased due to either the method of background subtraction or the functional form of the matched filter by performing two consistency checks .",
    "firstly , we make composite cluster profiles from regions of the pdcs fields which contain _ no _ detected clusters . for each `` blank '' region ,",
    "we randomly assign an estimated redshift drawn from the actual estimated redshift distribution .",
    "we then bin the galaxies , subtract the background , and stack the profiles in the same manner used to create the pdcs composites .",
    "the resulting composites are shown in fig .",
    "all profiles are consistent with zero , indicating that our method of background subtraction is reasonably accurate .",
    "secondly , we use the simulations described in  3.2 to examine whether our cluster composites accurately reflect the mean cluster profile as a function of redshift . in an identical manner to the pdcs",
    ", we have created cluster composites from those clusters detected in 10 simulated fields .",
    "we have examined the simulated cluster population which closely resembles the pdcs clusters ( @xmath114 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the best - fit @xmath50 parameters are listed in table 6 .",
    "the resulting composite profiles of the simulated clusters are consistent with the mean slope in each redshift interval and in each band .",
    "we have shown that our actual cluster composites ( fig .",
    "6 ) are a reliable representation of the global cluster population and are not significantly biased , as a function of redshift , by the intrinsic nature of the matched filter .",
    "observational studies of nearby clusters have shown that a significant portion of clusters exhibit evidence of ellipticity , multiple components , and other forms of substructure ( _ e.g. , _ geller & beers 1982 ; dressler & schectman 1988 ; west & bothun 1990 ; jones & forman 1992 ; mohr et al .",

    "the resulting average mass density profiles are all well - fit by a power - law @xmath125 for radii greater than @xmath126 ( or local density contrasts between 100 and 3000 ) .",
    "there exists a clear trend toward steeper slopes with decreasing @xmath127 .",
    "crone et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also found a correlation between steepening slopes and increasing spectral index @xmath128 in their initial power spectrum .",
    "in addition , jing et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that , for a given @xmath129 , clusters in the flat model ( @xmath130 ) have flatter mass density profiles than in the corresponding open model .",
    "a composite of these results are presented in fig .",
    "11 where we plot the slope of the _ surface _ mass density profile ( @xmath131 ) versus @xmath127 for simulated clusters at @xmath132 .",
    "flat cosmologies are indicated by closed circles , while open cosmologies are indicated by open circles .",
    "we would now like to compare the composite surface density profiles of the pdcs clusters with the cluster simulations ; however , the simulations model the total mass distribution , whereas we examine the galaxy distribution .",
    "it is now possible to map the total mass density distribution as a function of radius through observations in x - rays and through gravitational lensing of rich clusters of galaxies ( _ e.g. , _ henry , briel & nulsen 1994 ; smail 1995 ; tyson & fischer 1995 ; squires 1995 ) .",
    "these observations reveal that there is excellent agreement between the projected structure of the galaxy , gas , and dark matter distributions on scales larger than @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , a comparison between the composite surface density profiles of the pdcs clusters with those expected from the large scale simulations should allow reasonable constraints to be placed on the mass profiles . as discussed in tyson & fischer ( 1995 ) ,",
    "our mean projected density slope of @xmath134 is intermediate between standard cdm and an @xmath135 open cdm or @xmath136 cdm simulated profiles but appears to be a better match to the latter two . in fig .",
    "11 , we indicate by two dotted lines the range of power - law slopes that are obtained from the composite pdcs cluster profiles over the redshift range @xmath137 ( table 5 and fig . 6 ) .",
    "the @xmath121 profiles are indeed on the low end of our observed @xmath50 distribution ; however , this is far from conclusive .",
    "up to this point there has been little examination of the evolution of cluster profile shape as a function of redshift because the cluster samples at intermediate to high redshift have been sparse .",
    "the palomar survey provides the first statistically complete cluster survey over a large redshift range .",
    "the cluster composites may indicate that the profiles get _ steeper _ with increasing redshift .",
    "such a trend in the mean slope is most prominent in the i4 band though the trend is not significant given the large observational uncertainty .",
    "however , such an effect may also be observed in simulated clusters from high - resolution ( 20 kpc ) n body simulations ( xu 1995 ) . because clusters form much later in an @xmath121 universe , standard cdm shows the largest evolution in the cluster profile .",
    "the slope decreases from @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) to @xmath140 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the shallowing of the power - law slope at radii greater than @xmath141 is largely the result of an _ increase _ in the cluster core radius due to continued merging between @xmath139 and @xmath132 ( xu 1995 ; pen 1995 ) .",
    "profiles of clusters in an open ( @xmath135 ) cdm shows no detectable evolution with @xmath142 ( @xmath139 ) and @xmath143 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "@xmath144 models yield intermediate results .",
    "other non - standard cosmologies , such as mixed dark matter models , also show a steepening of the cluster profile with redshift ( walter & klypin 1995 ) . at present , with little redshift information , it is not possible to use the observed variation to rule out any cosmological model .",
    "the cluster morphology , or the degree of symmetry , has also been used to delineate between cosmological models ( evrard et al .",
    "1993 ; mohr et al .  1995 ; jing et al .",
    "n - body simulations and hydrodynamic simulations show that the surface density and x - ray image contours of clusters in low - density cdm models ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath122 ) are much more regular and centrally concentrated that those in an einstein - de sitter model ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "clusters in low @xmath127 cosmologies are older and are , therefore , more relaxed and symmetric than clusters in an @xmath121 universe .",

    "@xmath146 and @xmath147 ) also produce a large fraction of clusters with significant deviations from spherical symmetry , though the density and x - ray image contours are still rounder than the @xmath121 case .",
    "however , this matter is still controversial as pen ( 1995 ) and xu ( 1995 ) find little quantitative difference in the structure characteristics of clusters formed in these cosmological models .",
    "we have used the contours of constant amplitude of the matched filter signal to examine the degree of symmetry in the pdcs clusters .",

    "we have examined the galaxy distributions of the richest clusters of galaxies from the palomar distant cluster survey . through an analysis of individual cluster profiles and composite profiles as a function of redshift , we find that the typical palomar cluster has a profile of @xmath1 at radii greater than @xmath148 and a core radius of @xmath3 .",
    "the distribution of core radii in the palomar clusters indicates that up to 30% of the clusters have very small or essentially no core radii . using simple monte - carlo simulations",
    ", we have shown that the median cluster profile parameters appear to be an accurate representation of the actual cluster population ; the measurement errors associated with these parameters are @xmath81 in the surface density slope @xmath50 and @xmath82 in the cluster core radius @xmath25 .",
