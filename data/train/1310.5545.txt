    "<S> nonsymmetric koornwinder polynomials are multivariable extensions of nonsymmetric askey - wilson polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> they naturally arise in the representation theory of ( double ) affine hecke algebras . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how nonsymmetric koornwinder polynomials naturally arise in the theory of the heisenberg xxz spin-@xmath0 chain with general reflecting boundary conditions . a central role in this story </S>",
    "<S> is played by an explicit two - parameter family of spin representations of the two - boundary temperley - lieb algebra . </S>",
    "<S> these spin representations have three different appearances . </S>",
    "<S> their original definition relates them directly to the xxz spin chain , in the form of matchmaker representations they relate to temperley - lieb loop models in statistical physics , while their realization as principal series representations leads to the link with nonsymmetric koornwinder polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> the nonsymmetric difference cherednik - matsuo correspondence allows to construct for special parameter values laurent - polynomial solutions of the associated reflection quantum kz equations in terms of nonsymmetric koornwinder polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these aspects in detail by revisiting and extending work of de gier , kasatani , nichols , cherednik , the first author and many others .    </S>",
    "<S> dedicated to the 80th birthday of dick askey . </S>"
