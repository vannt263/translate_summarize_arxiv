    "reliable theoretical predictions for standard - model processes at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are important to ongoing searches for new physics .",
    "they are also important to the increasingly precise studies of the newly discovered higgs - like boson  @xcite , of the top quark , and of vector boson self - interactions .",
    "new - physics signals very typically lie beneath standard - model backgrounds in a broad range of search strategies . ferreting out the signals",
    "requires a good quantitative understanding of the backgrounds and their uncertainties . with the increasing jet multiplicities used in cutting - edge search strategies ,",
    "this becomes more and more challenging .",
    "some of the uncertainty surrounding predictions of standard - model background rates can be alleviated through use of data - driven estimates , but this technique also requires theoretical input to predict the ratios of background processes in signal regions to those for control processes or in control regions .",
    "predictions for background rates at the lhc rely on perturbative qcd , which enters all aspects of short - distance collisions at a hadron collider .",
    "leading - order ( lo ) predictions in qcd suffer from a strong dependence on the unphysical renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "this dependence gets stronger with increasing jet multiplicity .",
    "next - to - leading ( nlo ) results generally reduce this dependence dramatically , typically to a 10 - 15% residual sensitivity .",
    "thus they offer the first quantitatively reliable order in perturbation theory .",
    "the production of a @xmath0 boson in association with jets has played a special role in collider physics .",
    "it was the dominant background to top - quark pair production at the tevatron . at the lhc",
    "it remains an important background for precision studies , including those of top quarks .",
    "it is important to many new physics searches involving missing energy , including those for supersymmetry .",
    "recent searches have made use of samples with high jet multiplicity , and proposed searches aim to push to higher multiplicities yet .",
    "precise quantitative control over the theoretical predictions leads to improved sensitivity to new phenomena .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 boson production in association with multiple jets have been made by the cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite collaborations at the tevatron , and by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations at the lhc .",
    "such measurements also permit stringent tests of the predictions of the standard model .",
    "theoretical predictions for the production of vector bosons with a lower multiplicity of jets ( one or two jets ) have been available at nlo in qcd for many years  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the advent of new on - shell techniques  @xcite for computing one - loop amplitudes at larger multiplicity has led to nlo results for three  @xcite and four  @xcite associated jets .",
    "other new results include those for the production of vector - boson pairs  @xcite or top  anti - top pairs  @xcite in association with two jets .",
    "another recent approach  @xcite has been demonstrated in the production of up to seven jets in @xmath1 collisions , and shows promise for lhc physics as well .",
    "there have also been important advances with more traditional methods , especially for the case of heavy quarks  @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we take another step forward in multiplicity , presenting nlo results for inclusive -jet production at the lhc .",
    "these are the first nlo qcd results at a hadron collider with six or more electroweak bosons or jets in the final state .",
    "we incorporate the decay of the @xmath0 boson into leptons , so that there are seven final - state objects to track .    in the present paper we use on -",
    "shell methods as implemented in numerical form in the blackhat software library  @xcite .",
    "this library , together with the sherpa package  @xcite , has previously been used to make nlo predictions for -jet production  @xcite , for -jet production  @xcite , and for four - jet production  @xcite .",
    "it has also been used in investigations of high-@xmath2 @xmath0 polarization  @xcite , and to compute -jet to -jet ratios for assessing theoretical uncertainties  @xcite in the cms searches  @xcite for supersymmetric particles .",
    "the atlas collaboration has also used results from blackhat computations with sherpa for standard - model studies of electroweak vector - boson production in association with three or more jets  @xcite .",

    "sherpa is used to manage the numerous partonic subprocesses entering the calculation , to integrate over phase space , to construct physical distributions , and to output  @xcite @xmath3-tuples .",
    "in contrast to earlier computations , we use the comix package  @xcite to compute born and real - emission matrix elements , along with the catani ",
    "seymour  @xcite dipole subtraction terms . rather than repeating the entire computation for each scale and for each parton distribution function ( pdf ) set , we store intermediate results in @xmath3-tuple format , recording momenta for all partons in an event , along with the coefficients of various scale- or pdf - dependent functions in the event weight .",
    "the @xmath3-tuple storage makes it possible to evaluate cross sections and distributions for different scales and pdf error sets .",
    "we perform the basic calculation with loose cuts , also making it possible to choose different ( tighter ) cuts without recomputing the time - consuming matrix elements .    in this paper , we compute the total cross sections at nlo for inclusive -jet and -jet production with @xmath4 and describe @xmath5 ratios and -jet/-jet ratios .",
    "such ratios can be sensitive probes of new physics .",
    "we also study two types of distributions : the differential cross section in the total hadronic transverse energy @xmath6 , and the complete set of differential cross sections in the jet transverse momenta . for four and five jets we make use of a leading - color approximation for the virtual contributions .",
    "this approximation has been shown to have subleading - color corrections of under 3% for processes with four or fewer associated jets  @xcite .",

    ", the @xmath11 subprocesses are all obtained from @xmath12 by crossing five of the partons into the final state .",
    "similarly , we obtain the subprocesses for the @xmath13 case from the various crossings of the subprocesses @xmath14 the @xmath0 boson changes the quark flavor and couples to the @xmath15-@xmath16 line .",

    "sample feynman diagrams illustrating virtual contributions with 1 , 2 and 3 external quark pairs are shown in ( although our calculation is not based on feynman diagrams ) .",
    "all contributions to the virtual corrections are included in a leading - color approximation described below .",
    "besides the virtual contributions , nlo qcd requires also real - emission contributions with an additional parton in the final state .",
    "here we keep the full color dependence .",
    "however , we drop the finite contributions from tree amplitudes with four external quark pairs ; they contribute well under 1% to the cross section .",
    "sample real - emission diagrams are displayed in .",
    "the decay of the vector boson ( @xmath18 ) into a charged lepton and neutrino is included at the amplitude level ; no on - shell approximation is made for the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the lepton - pair invariant mass follows a relativistic breit - wigner distribution with width given by @xmath19  gev and mass @xmath20  gev .",
    "( the other electroweak parameters are also chosen as in ref .",
    "we take the leptonic decay products to be massless . in this approximation",
    ", of course , the results for muon final states are identical to those for electrons .",
    "the five light quarks , @xmath21 , are all treated as massless .",
    "we do not include contributions to the amplitudes from a real or virtual top quark ; its omission should have a percent - level effect on the overall result  @xcite .",
    "we also approximate the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix by the unit matrix .",
    "as previously determined for the three - jet case , this approximation causes a change of under 1% in total cross sections for the cuts we impose  @xcite , and should also be completely negligible in our study .",
    "we use standard kinematic variables , whose definitions may be found in appendix  a of ref .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales in ref .",
    "@xcite were chosen as multiples of a total partonic transverse energy @xmath22 .",
    "we will use a modified version of it here , @xmath23 where the sum runs over all final - state partons @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "all partons @xmath24 are included in @xmath26 , whether or not they are inside jets that pass the cuts .",
    "this quantity is not directly measurable ; however , it is very similar to the more usual jet - based total transverse energy , and it is more practical for use as a dynamical scale choice . both @xmath22 and the modified version @xmath26 are independent of the experimental cuts .",
    "thus , modifying the cuts will not affect the value of the matrix element at a point in phase space .",
    "this makes it suitable as a choice of renormalization or factorization scale , avoiding unwanted dependence on experimental cuts .",
    "later we will compute the distribution in the jet - based observable @xmath6 .",
    "this variable is similar to the partonic version , @xmath26 , except that the @xmath0 boson @xmath27 is omitted , and it is based on jets passing all cuts .",
    "we define jets using the anti-@xmath28 algorithm  @xcite with parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the jets are ordered in @xmath2 , and are labeled @xmath30 in order of decreasing transverse momentum @xmath31 , with jet @xmath32 being the leading ( hardest ) jet .",
    "the transverse mass of the @xmath0 boson is computed from the transverse momenta of its leptonic decay products , @xmath33 .    in our study , we consider the inclusive process @xmath34 jets at an lhc center - of - mass energy of @xmath35 tev with the following set of cuts : @xmath36 , to equal the neutrino transverse energy , @xmath37 .",
    "in carrying out the computation we imposed a set of looser cuts and generated  @xcite format @xmath3-tuples .",
    "as mentioned above and described further below , the @xmath3-tuples store intermediate results such as parton momenta and coefficients associated with the event weights for the events passing the looser cuts , whose only restriction is that the minimum jet transverse momentum is @xmath38  gev .",
    "the @xmath3-tuples are also valid for anti-@xmath28 , @xmath28 and siscone algorithms  @xcite for @xmath39 , as implemented in the fastjet package  @xcite . in the siscone case",
    "the merging parameter @xmath40 is chosen to be @xmath41 .",
    "this allows the @xmath3-tuples to be used for studying the effects of varying the jet algorithm , along with variations due to parton distributions , scale choices , and experimental cuts .    in our study",
    ", we use the mstw2008 lo and nlo pdfs  @xcite at the respective orders .",
    "we use the five - flavor running @xmath42 and the value of @xmath43 supplied with the parton distribution functions .",
    "our predictions are at parton level .",
    "we do not apply corrections due to non - perturbative effects such as those induced by the underlying event or hadronization . for comparisons to experiment",
    "it is important to incorporate these effects , although for most cross - section ratios we do not expect them to be large .",
    "parton - shower event generators such as powheg and mc@nlo  @xcite , and further refinements of these methods  @xcite , have been developed that consistently include a parton shower and maintain nlo accuracy for events with a specified jet multiplicity .",
    "more recently , advances have been made in maintaining the nlo accuracy across different jet multiplicities in a single sample  @xcite .",
    "these advances mark an important step in significantly reducing theoretical uncertainties associated with hadron - level predictions of many types of lhc events .",
    "we look forward to applying them in the future to the production of @xmath0 bosons with up to five additional jets .",
    "the new techniques we use for obtaining virtual contributions are collectively known as on - shell methods , and are reviewed in refs .",
    "these methods rely on underlying properties of amplitudes  factorization and unitarity  in order to express them in terms of simpler , on - shell amplitudes of lower multiplicity . while amplitudes necessarily contain off - shell states inside loops or trees , avoiding direct use of these states",
    "allows the method to avoid the gauge dependence they induce . eliminating the gauge dependence",
    "greatly reduces the enormous cancellations of intermediate terms that would plague a textbook feynman - diagram calculation .",
    "the first application of the unitarity method  @xcite to collider physics was to obtain the analytic matrix elements for @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 )  @xcite , used in the nlo program mcfm  @xcite .",
    "more recently , on - shell methods been implemented in a more flexible numerical form , breaking the long - standing bottleneck to nlo computations for higher - multiplicity final states posed by the one - loop ( virtual ) corrections .",
    "these methods scale well as the number of external legs increases  @xcite",
    ". there have also been important advances in computing virtual corrections with more traditional methods  @xcite .",
    "one - loop amplitudes in qcd with massless quarks may be expressed as a sum over three different types of feynman integrals ( boxes , triangles , and bubbles ) with additional so - called rational terms .",
    "the integrals are universal and well - tabulated , so the aim of the calculation is to compute their coefficients , along with the rational terms . in an on - shell approach ,",
    "the integral coefficients may be computed using four - dimensional generalized unitarity  @xcite , while the rational terms may be computed either by a loop - level version  @xcite of on - shell recursion  @xcite or using @xmath48-dimensional unitarity  @xcite .",
    "we use a numerical version  @xcite of forde s method  @xcite for the integral coefficients , and subtract box and triangle integrands similar to the ossola ",
    "pittau procedure  @xcite , improving the numerical stability . to compute the rational terms",
    ", we use a numerical implementation of badger s massive continuation method  @xcite , which is related to @xmath48-dimensional unitarity .",
    "these algorithms are implemented in an enhanced version of the blackhat code  @xcite .",
    "blackhat organizes the computation of the amplitudes in terms of elementary gauge - invariant `` primitive amplitude '' building blocks  @xcite .",
    "many primitive amplitudes can be associated with feynman diagrams in which all external partons touch the loop ( i.e.  there are no nontrivial trees attached to the loop ) .",
    "representative feynman diagrams for the leading - color primitive amplitudes used in the present calculation are shown in .",
    "the primitive amplitudes are then assembled into partial amplitudes , which are the kinematic coefficients of the different color tensors that can appear in the amplitude .",
    "the complete virtual cross section is obtained by interfering the one - loop partial amplitudes with the tree - level amplitude and summing over spins and color indices .",
    "the color factors arising from the color sum in the assembly of primitive amplitudes into partial amplitudes become highly nontrivial as the number of quark lines increases ; we use a general solution given in ref .",
    "an important feature is that each primitive building block has a relatively simple analytic structure with only a limited number of spurious singularities present .",
    "a given primitive amplitude can appear in multiple partial amplitudes and does not have to be recomputed for each one .",
    "this approach also allows for a straightforward separation of leading- and subleading - color contributions .",
    "this separation can be exploited to significantly enhance the efficiency of the monte carlo integration  @xcite : the subleading - color contributions are much smaller , yet more computationally costly ; separating them out allows them to be evaluated at far fewer phase - space points than the leading - color contributions , in order to obtain similar absolute uncertainties .    in the -jet calculations we drop altogether the small but time - consuming subleading - color contributions to the virtual corrections .",
    "as explicitly verified for three-  @xcite and four - jet production  @xcite , the omitted subleading - color contributions to the virtual corrections are typically 10% of the leading - color virtual terms , and under 3% of the total cross section .",
    "we expect the dropped subleading - color contributions to be similarly small for -jet production .",
    "the precise version of the leading - color approximation for the virtual terms used here is the one of ref .",
    "it retains full - color dependence in all contributions multiplying poles in the dimensional regularization parameter @xmath49 in the virtual corrections . in the finite parts of the virtual corrections , it drops certain contributions that are subleading in the number of colors @xmath50 in the formal limit @xmath51 , with @xmath52",
    "held fixed .",
    "in particular , we drop those finite parts of the leading - color partial amplitudes that are suppressed by explicit powers of @xmath53 , as well as all finite parts of the subleading - color partial amplitudes . in forming the color - summed interference of the surviving parts of the one - loop amplitudes with the tree amplitudes",
    ", we do not drop any further terms .",
    "the blackhat code uses the four - dimensional helicity ( fdh ) scheme  @xcite internally but automatically shifts the result before output to the t  hooft  veltman scheme  @xcite using the full - color dependence in the shift .",
    "the approximation differs in these last two aspects from the one used in the earlier blackhat calculation of -jet production  @xcite .",
    "this causes very slight shifts , under a percent , in our reported cross sections for -jet production for @xmath54 compared to ref .",
    "( a somewhat larger shift arises from the choice of a five - flavor scheme for the running of the coupling instead of the six - flavor scheme used earlier . )",
    "the nlo result also requires real - emission corrections to the lo process , which arise from tree - level amplitudes with one additional parton ; sample contributions are illustrated in .",
    "for @xmath0 production with four or five associated jets we use the  comix code  @xcite , included in the sherpa framework  @xcite , to compute these contributions , including the catani - seymour dipole subtraction terms  @xcite .",
    "the comix code is based on a color - dressed form  @xcite of the berends - giele recursion relations  @xcite , making it very efficient for processes with high multiplicities .",
    "when there are fewer jets , we use the amegic++ package  @xcite instead . in order to carry out the monte carlo integration over phase space we use an efficient hierarchical phase - space generator based on qcd antenna structures  @xcite , as incorporated into sherpa .",
    "the integration is performed using an adaptive algorithm  @xcite . running the algorithm in a stable and convergent manner for the real - emission contributions",
    "is highly nontrivial , in particular given the intricate structure of their infrared subtractions .    in general ,",
    "the same physical distributions need to be analyzed at different pdf error sets , different renormalization or factorization scales , and for different jet algorithms or experimental cuts .",
    "we have organized the computation so the matrix elements do not have to be reevaluated for each choice of parameters  @xcite . for each event",
    "we generate , we record the momenta for all partons , along with the numerical values of the coefficients of the various scale- or pdf - dependent functions .",
    "each term contains a simple function we wish to vary , such as a logarithm of the renormalization scale , multiplied by a numerical coefficient independent of such variation .",
    "we store the intermediate information in -format @xmath3-tuple files  @xcite . at the end of the main computation",
    "we assemble the stored matrix - element coefficients , the pdf and scale choices to obtain cross sections .",

    "the charge - asymmetry ratios are all significantly greater than unity , and grow with increasing numbers of jets .",
    "the jet - production ratios are of order @xmath91 , and decrease with increasing numbers of jets .",
    "the nlo corrections to the charge - asymmetry are quite small , and the corrections to the jet - production ratios are modest but noticeable .",
    "these values of the charge - asymmetry ratio reflect the excess of up quarks over down quarks in the proton .",
    "the @xmath13 bosons are necessarily emitted by up - type quarks , whereas @xmath11 bosons are emitted by down - type quarks .",
    "the up - quark excess in the proton then leads to larger @xmath13 cross sections .",
    "as the number of jets increases , production of a @xmath0 requires a larger value of the momentum fraction @xmath92 .",
    "this alters the mix of subprocesses that contribute to vector - boson production , and also increases the @xmath93 ratio .",
    "the case of -jet production is special , because the @xmath94 initial state is absent at lo . in general",
    ", the @xmath94 initial state contribution is expected to decrease with increasing @xmath92 ; but for @xmath95 production this contribution actually increases with the number of jets , for production in association with two through four jets ( judged by lo fractions ) ; only for more than four jets does it start to decrease as expected .",
    "( in @xmath13 production , it starts to decrease above three rather than four accompanying jets . )",
    "the @xmath96 initial state decreases , but the @xmath97 initial state increases ; the net effect , along with the increase in the @xmath93 fraction , is an increase in the @xmath5 ratio .",
    "the results presented here extend our previous nlo analysis of these ratios with up to four accompanying jets  @xcite to the case of five accompanying jets .",
    "both the lo and the nlo ratios are quite insensitive to correlated variations of the renormalization and factorization scales in numerator and denominator , so we do not quote the variation here , and only show the uncertainty from the numerical integration .    the increase in typical values of @xmath92 with increasing numbers of jets also reduces the values of both the strong coupling @xmath82 and the derivatives of the parton distributions , leading to a decrease in the jet - production ratios . the double ratios  the ratios of the lo cross sections in the fifth column of to those in the third column , and of the nlo cross sections in the last column to those in the fourth column",
    " are roughly constant , suggesting that the decrease is primarily due to the decrease of @xmath82 with increasing scale .",
    "we can use the ratios to extrapolate to larger number of jets for the cuts used in this study .",
    "this approach was recently investigated using jet calculus and found to be a good approximation when the jets are required to have the same minimum transverse momenta  @xcite .",
    "( substantially different cuts could give rise to different behavior . ) while ratios involving -jet production behave differently from the rest , both because of strong kinematic constraints and because of missing production channels ( at lo ) , the remaining ratios turn out to allow an excellent fit to a straight line . for the charge ratio ( to ) , the results through -jet production would suffice to yield a non - trivial prediction ; the ratio for -jet production confirms this prediction . for the jet - production ratios ( to ) ,",
    "the - to -jet production ratio is essential to making a non - trivial prediction , as it provides a third point in the fit .",
    "while these extrapolations should not be taken to too large a number of jets @xmath3 , we expect them to provide a reasonable prediction for @xmath3 somewhat beyond five .",
    "for the lo charge ratio with @xmath3 jets , we obtain the following prediction ( @xmath98 ) , @xmath99 for the nlo ratio , @xmath100    for the @xmath11 jet - production ratio at lo , we find the following prediction ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 at nlo , we find , @xmath103 similarly , for the @xmath13 jet - production ratio at lo , we find the following prediction ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath104 and at nlo , we find , @xmath105 the slopes for @xmath13 and @xmath11 differ slightly at lo but are essentially the same at nlo .",
    "these predictions are based on fits to the data in .",
    "( more precisely , they are based on an ensemble of 10,000 fits to synthetic data distributed in a gaussian according to the cross sections and statistical error in from which the ratios in were computed . )    from , we obtain the following predictions for the nlo cross sections for production of a @xmath106 in association with six jets , @xmath107 matching the experimental cuts used for . the ratio of these two predictions , @xmath108 , is consistent with an extrapolation using , @xmath109 .",
    "in this paper , we presented the first nlo qcd results for inclusive -jet production at the lhc at @xmath77  tev .",
    "this process is an important background to many new physics searches involving missing energy , as well as to precise top - quark measurements .",
    "in addition to its phenomenological usefulness , it also sets a new bar for the state of the art in perturbative qcd at next - to - leading order , at hadron - collider processes with six final - state objects including jets .",
    "we have adopted a number of approximations in this work : the leading - color approximation for the virtual terms ; neglecting top - quark loops ; and neglecting infrared - finite parts of real - emission contributions with four quark pairs . based on studies of -jet production and @xmath0 production in associated with fewer jets  @xcite",
    ", we expect the leading - color approximation to change cross sections by no more than 3% , and the other approximations to be smaller yet .",
    "hence these approximations should have no phenomenological significance , given the other theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we find a dramatic reduction in scale dependence in nlo predictions for the total cross section , and for differential distributions as well .",
    "the scale dependence of observables shrinks from more than a factor of two variation at lo to a 20% sensitivity at nlo for -jet production . with our dynamical scale choice in , we find @xmath76 factors typically between 0.6 and 1 , with moderate though non - trivial changes in shapes of distributions .",
    "we have studied a number of ratios , between @xmath13 and @xmath11 production , and for processes differing by the addition of one jet .",
    "the qcd corrections to these ratios are more modest than to total cross sections , and they should also benefit from milder experimental systematical uncertainties .",
    "the ratios show interesting trends with increasing number of jets , and with results for -jet production in hand , we can make plausible extrapolations to results for additional jets .",
    "these ratios also probe the evolution of different subprocesses with increasing parton fraction @xmath92 .",
    "the present study brings an unprecedented level of precision to -jet production .",
    "we look forward to comparing the nlo results for this process , and for the extrapolations to yet higher numbers of jets based upon it , with lhc data .",
