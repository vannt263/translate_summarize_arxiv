    "there is now an extended body of evidence in support of superfluidity in dense , nucleonic matter , such as that which is believed to exist in neutron stars .",
    "using conservative estimates one can argue for a fermi temperature on the order of @xmath2 for neutrons in media with supranuclear densities , and that the transition temperature to a superfluid state is about @xmath3 .",
    "this is a signficiant fact since it is generally accepted that nascent neutron stars formed from supernovae should cool fairly quickly , and consequently their internal temperatures should pass quickly through the transition value .",
    "observational support for such transitions is supplied by the well established glitch phenomenon in pulsars @xcite .",
    "these are rapid decreases in the rotational periods followed by a slow recovery @xcite , much too slow to be explained by ordinary fluid viscosity @xcite .",
    "the best description is based on superfluid quantized vortices , and how they pin , unpin and then repin as the pulsar s rotation rate evolves @xcite .",
    "we present here a fully relativistic formalism to model the rotational properties of superfluid neutron stars within a slow rotation approximation , which is an extension to second order in the rotation rates the previous work of comer and joynt @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the studies of neutron star superfluidity have been in the newtonian regime , where the intent is not to be quantitatively descriptive but rather to gain qualitative understandings .",
    "however , it is becoming increasingly apparent that general relativity is required to obtain even qualitative understandings .  and",
    "even if the qualitative does not vary between the two regimes , the number of examples is growing where general relativity can yield factors of two difference from newtonian calculations ( as opposed to `` merely '' @xmath4 to @xmath5 corrections ) .",
    "for example , recent modelling of supernovae has revealed that when general relativity is included the range of model parameters that exhibit multiple bounces is significantly smaller than the range found for the newtonian case @xcite .",
    "the use of general relativistic hydrodynamics has also led to predictions of the shock radius ( during the shock reheating phase ) being reduced by a factor of two and a corresponding increase by a factor of two for the inflow speed of the material behind the shock @xcite .",
    "certainly the need to use general relativity must only be enhanced as supernova remnants become more compact .",
    "weber @xcite provides an excellent overview of the many suggestions for the matter content of these remnants , the neutron stars .",
    "they range from the traditional neutron / proton / electron models to more exotic configurations with kaon or muon condensates in the core , or hyperons , or even strange stars with absolutely stable u , d , s quark matter .",
    "in our study we will be somewhat conservative by considering typical traditional neutron star models , composed of superfluid neutrons , superconducting protons ( with proton fractions on the order of @xmath6 ) , and a highly degenerate relativistic gas of electrons .",
    "each species extends from the center of the star all the way to the surface , although in principle one could consider a more realistic scenario wherein the protons and electrons extend out further than the neutrons @xcite and in that way mimic features of a crust .",
    "this same technique could be applied in neutron star cores , allowing for the possibility of alternating regions of ordinary fluid and superfluid .",
    "the local thermodynamic equilibrium of the matter will be modelled using a relativistic @xmath0 - @xmath1 mean field approach of the type that is attributed to walecka @xcite and discussed in detail for neutron stars by glendenning @xcite .",
    "we consider a relativistic approach to be important on two different levels .  on the macroscopic level",
    "there is the need for general relativity that was discussed above .",
    "but on a microscopic level , recall that any fluid approximation for matter has built into it the notion of local , fluid elements .",
    "they are small enough that they can be considered to be points with respect to the rest of the star , and yet large enough to contain , say , an avogadro s number of particles .  at the densities expected for neutron stars , the local , fermi levels for",
    "the nucleons can become high enough that the effective velocities of the nucleons with respect to their fluid elements are relativistic .",
    "as for the fluid elements themselves , they can also , in principle , approach speeds near that of light , although in practice ( e.g.  for quasinormal mode @xcite or slow rotation calculations @xcite ) they will typically have speeds a few percent of that of light .    because of the superfluidity of the neutrons , and superconductivity of the protons , the fluid formalism to be used differs fundamentally from the standard perfect fluid approach in that the neutrons can flow independently of the protons and electrons .",
    "there are thus two fluid degrees of freedom in the system , requiring two sets of fluid elements , one set for the neutrons and another for the charged constituents since the electromagnetic interaction very effectively `` ties '' the electrons to the protons .",
    "the matter description , therefore , must take into account two fermi levels for the nucleons , and a displacement in momentum space between their respective fermi spheres that will result when one fluid flows with respect to the other .",
    "the specification of a local thermodynamic equilibrium for the two fluids requires that the local neutron and `` proton '' ( i.e.  a conglomeration of the protons and electrons ) number densities be known as well as the local , relative velocity of the proton fluid elements , say , with respect to those of the neutrons .",
    "when the fermi spheres for the nucleons are displaced with respect to each other there results an important effect for neutron star dynamics known as entrainment @xcite .",
    "sauls @xcite describes the entrainment effect using quasiparticle language , i.e.  just because the neutrons are superfluid and protons superconducting does not mean they no longer feel the strong force .  on the contrary",
    ", an individual neutron should be understood as being surrounded by a polarization cloud of other neutrons and protons .  when this neutron moves , it will be accompanied by this cloud of nucleons .",
    "the net effect at the level of the fluid elements is that the momentum of a neutron fluid element is a linear combination of the neutron _ and _ proton number density currents .",
    "parameters that are important for entrainment in neutron stars have been calculated in the newtonian regime using a fermi - liquid approach @xcite and in the relativistic regime via a @xmath0 - @xmath1 mean field model @xcite .",
    "comer and joynt @xcite find that one of the key parameters that has been much used in superfluid neutron star modelling extends over a much larger range of values than what the newtonian analysis of borumand et al would imply @xcite .",
    "comer and joynt also used their formalism to obtain first order rotational corrections to a superfluid neutron star s equilibrium state , which for general relativity means determining the frame - dragging , and the angular momentum .",
    "we will extend those calculations to the second order in the rotation rates , and thereby determine rotational corrections to the metric , distribution of particles , the total mass , shape , and the kepler , mass - shedding limit .",
    "we construct sequences of equilibrium configurations where members of the sequence have the same relative rotation between the neutrons and protons but are distinguished by their central neutron number densities .",
    "we also construct sequences where the central neutron number density is fixed and the relative rotation is allowed to vary ( cf .",
    "@xcite for discussions on when to expect a relative rotation ) .",
    "one other straightforward , but important , extension here of the work of comer and joynt is a proof that the matter coefficients obtained by them are sufficient for our second order calculations .    in order to have a",

    "we will use the formalism developed by carter , langlois , and their various collaborators @xcite .",

    "the fact that the neutron momentum @xmath16 , say , is not simply proportional to its number density current @xmath17 is a result of entrainment between the neutrons and protons , which we see vanishes if the @xmath13 coefficient is zero .",

    "<S> neutron stars that are cold enough should have two or more superfluids / supercondutors in their inner crusts and cores .  </S>",
    "<S> the implication of superfluidity / superconductivity for equilibrium and dynamical neutron star states is that each individual particle species that forms a condensate must have its own , independent number density current and equation of motion that determines that current .   </S>",
    "<S> an important consequence of the quasiparticle nature of each condensate is the so - called entrainment effect , i.e.  the momentum of a condensate is a linear combination of its own current and those of the other condensates .  </S>",
