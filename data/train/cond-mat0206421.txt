    "stripes have been an area of active study in the high - temperature superconductivity research .",
    "they are modulations of charge and spin densities , and can be static or dynamic . in 1995 ,",
    "tranquada and coworkers@xcite observed the coexistence of superconducting and stripe domain order for the material la@xmath0nd@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 at around doping @xmath4 .",
    "the stripes are one - dimensional objects on a two - dimensional plane , and they have been called `` self - organized one dimensionality.''@xcite search for stripes in the hubbard and @xmath5 models has been intense and is still going strong ( see ref .   for a review of some experimental results and theoretical considerations ) .",
    "> from the theory side , there are basically two roads .",
    "one approach is using microscopic models such as the hubbard and @xmath5 models to study numerically stripe formation and phase separation .",
    "dmrg appears to be the best tool in such studies and has been applied to the @xmath5 model in refs .  .",
    "another approach to stripes is to use effective field theories , treating stripes as macroscopic objects ( macrosopic in the sense of many - particle collective motion ) .",
    "for example in ref .  , zaanen considered stripes as `` a gas of elastic quantum strings in @xmath6 dimensions . ''",
    "the microscopic , numerical approach can be used to understand the mechanism for stripe formation and to derive macroscopic parameters such as stripe - stripe interaction energy and stripe stiffness , but it is limited by computational power .",
    "the macroscopic approach on the other hand takes these macroscopic parameters as an input and can obtain results relevant to experiments , but it can explain less about mechanism",
    ". we will follow the microscopic route which enables us to obtain macroscopic parameters from diagonalization data .      in this paper , we study stripes in a strongly - interacting model of spinless fermions and hardcore bosons on the square latttice .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath7 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we study both the spinless fermion and the hardcore boson versions of the model . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spinless fermion or hardcore boson creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath10 , @xmath11 the number operator , @xmath12 the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude , and @xmath13 the nearest - neighbor interaction . at the each site",
    "there can be at the most one particle .",
    "furthermore , we study the strong - correlation limit of the model and take @xmath14 , i.e. , infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "the spinless fermion and hardcore boson model with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion involves a significant reduction of the hilbert space as compared to the hubbard model .",
    "the hubbard model on the @xmath15 lattice at half - filling , with 8 spin - up and 8 spin - down electrons has @xmath16 states in the largest matrix block , after reduction by particle conservation , translation , and the symmetries of the square.@xcite in our model with infinite @xmath13 , after using particle conservation and translation symmetry ( but not point group symmetry ) , the largest matrix for the @xmath17 system has @xmath18 states ( for 11 particles ) .",
    "we can therefore compute for all fillings the @xmath17 system whereas for the hubbard model @xmath15 is basically the limit .",
    "this also means that at certain limits we can obtain results that are difficult to obtain in the hubbard model , for example , we can exactly diagonalize a system of two length-8 stripes on the @xmath19 lattice .",
    "this is one of the two papers that we are publishing to systematically study the phase diagram of the spinless fermion and hardcore boson model on the square lattice with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion . in the other paper ,  @xcite we study the dilute limit of this model eq .",
    "( [ eq - ham ] ) , focusing on the problem of a few particles , and that limit is dominated by two - body interactions . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the near - half - filled limit of our model , where stripes are natural objects .    with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion , the maximum filling fraction ( particle per site ) for our model is 1/2 , for both spinless fermions and hardcore bosons . at exactly half - filling ,",
    "the particles form a checkerboard configuration that can not move . adding a single hole to it can not produce motion either because the hole is confined by neighboring particles .",
    "a natural way to add holes to this system is to align them in a row going across the system , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - hole ] .",
    "we call this row of holes a stripe and it is the subject of study in this paper .        for many systems with certain aspect ratios ( e.g. , the @xmath20 lattice depicted in fig .  [ fig - hole ] )",
    ", the stripe state is the one with the smallest number of holes and nonzero energy .",
    "here we have an interesting kind of physics of extended , fluctuating , quantum mechanical objects , that are results of collective motions of many particles .",
    "spinless models related to the present one have been invoked occasionally in the literature  @xcite but usually in the context of a specific question about spinfull models : it was recognized that a spinless model would capture the same physics with fewer complications .",
    "the only systematic work on phase diagram of spinless fermions is by uhrig .",
    "@xcite however , the method is expansion around infinite dimensionality ; this will have special difficulty with arrays of domain walls , since wall fluctuations and the attendant kinetic energy are strongly suppressed in high dimensions .",
    "the falicov - kimball model is an alternate way to simplify the hubbard model , which is also commonly presented in a spinless form ,  @xcite and develops stripe - like incommensurate patterns .",
    "@xcite however , this model includes a second immobile ( classical ) species of electron , so its stripes can not have quantum fluctuations .",
    "@xcite    no known electron system realizes our model , even approximately .",
    "a `` half - metallic '' ferromagnet  @xcite  meaning that for one spin state , the conduction band is all filled or all empty  realizes a spinless model for the other spin state .",
    "however in the best - known half - metals , the manganites ,  @xcite the formation of inhomogeneities is dominated by lattice distortions and orbital degeneracies ( not to mention static pinning disorder ) , so that quantum - fluctuating defects find no role in current theories of manganites .",
    "( the same may be true for the verwey transition in magnetite ,  @xcite which was modeled previously with spinless electrons  @xcite . )",
    "conceivably the spinless model could be realized in an array of semiconductor quantum dots in a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    the most plausible realization of the boson version of our model would be an adsorbed gas of @xmath21he on a substrate with square symmetry .",
    "( the same model ",
    "but on a triangular lattice  has been introduced independently to model @xmath21he on nanotube  @xcite ) .",
    "the fermion case could similarly be realized , in principle , by spin - polarized @xmath22he , however it would be difficult to achieve a degree of polarization sufficient to neglect the minority spin state .",
    "this paper appears to be the first using exact diagonalization ( as opposed to dmrg ) to investigate the properties of interacting stripes with a microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite      in real fermion systems , stripes ( antiphase domain walls containing holes ) have been a prominent object of experimental study in the high-@xmath23 cuprates .",
    "@xcite stripe - based mechanisms have been proposed for high - temperature superconductivity ,  @xcite but the prevalent current opinion is that stripes compete with superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    nevertheless , stripes are obviously clues to how the charge and spin degrees of freedom interact with each other , which is important in a majority of the high-@xmath23 theories .",
    "stripes are modeled theoretically and numerically using the same hubbard model ( or its variations ) which were already accepted as models of homogeneous phases .",
    "it is still unsettled whether stripes are stabilized in this model , which omits long - range and even nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion .",
    "the most explicit calculations are by density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , adapted to two - dimensional systems formed into strips .",
    "@xcite the results favor stripes with 1/2 holes per unit length , as found in experiments ; however , those simulations are strongly influenced by the ( necessary ) open boundary conditions on two sides .",
    "what relation can our spinless model have to these spinfull models ?",
    "firstly , at the intermediate scales appropriate to a stripe array , the spinfull and spinless systems are modeled in very similar ways : stripes are mutually repelling , quantum - fluctuating strings .",
    "this level is appropriate to studies of the anisotropic transport expected in a ( non - superconducting ) stripe array , as well as the stripe interactions , as has been emphasized by zaanen .",
    "@xcite in the spinfull models , only a little has been done to explicitly relate the macroscopic parameters to the underlying microscopic model .",
    "@xcite in our model  and unlike any spinfull model  exact diagonalization can address phenomena such as the effective mass and interactions of carriers on a stripe , long - wavelength stripe fluctuations , stripe - stripe repulsion , or the transfer of carriers from one stripe to the next .",
    "thus , not only analytically but numerically , one can go quite far in extracting such parameters for our model .    secondly , if spinfull stripes are stabilized at all ( in the absence of long - range repulsion ) , it is by kinetic energy in the same fashion that our stripes are stabilized . in either case ,",
    "a fermion belonging to one domain hops transverse to the stripe , and ( since the stripe is also an antiphase domain wall ) still finds itself correctly placed in the order of the new domain . in our model",
    ", that order is the `` checkerboard '' pattern , which is enforced by the nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath13 . from this viewpoint",
    ", @xmath13 is analogous to the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath24 in the @xmath12-@xmath24 model .",
    "( our @xmath25 limit then corresponds to the case @xmath26 , which is the unphysical regime of the @xmath12-@xmath24 model . )",
    "an even more precise correspondence would be to stripes in the @xmath12-@xmath27 model :  @xcite in that system ( as in ours ) the undoped , ordered state breaks a discrete ( ising - type ) symmetry , and hence is practically inert , supporting no gapless goldstone ( spinwave ) excitations : only the stripe itself has low - energy excitations .",
    "if the ordered state had a continuous symmetry , as in the hubbard or @xmath12-@xmath24 models , spin - wave modes can mediate a @xmath28 attraction  @xcite between stripes ( where @xmath29 is the stripe separation ) .",
    "if short - distance kinetic energy were to favor a stripe array , the long - range force mediated by continuous spins implies phase separation in the limit of very small doping .",
    "@xcite    our stripes with an occupation of 0.5 hole per unit length are insulating and correspond to insulating stripes of 1 hole per unit length in the @xmath12-@xmath24 model ( the factor of two reflects the density of the ordered background state ) , as implied in the original ideas  @xcite about stripe stabilization from a strong - coupling viewpoint .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first ( in sec",
    ".  [ sec - diagstripe ] ) we describe briefly our exact diagonalization code for studying the near - half - filled limit of our model .",
    "we use translation symmetry to block diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "a graph viewpoint motivates a method of building the basis states from a starting configuration and explains the relation between boson and fermion energy spectra .    next ( sec .  [ sec - onestripe ] )",
    "we study the problem of a single stripe . here",
    "particles can only move in one direction , effectively reducing the 2d problem to a 1d one .",
    "this one - stripe problem maps exactly to a spin-1/2 chain , which is exactly solvable using bethe ansatz . using the single - stripe energy dispersion relation along the direction perpendicular to the stripe , we obtain stripe effective mass for motion in that direction .    in the next two sections , we study the problem of one or two holes on a stripe .",
    "( for the one - hole case , the bosons and fermions have the same energy spectrum . )",
    "we determine the dispersion relationship ( energy gap and effective mass ) for one hole moving on a stripe , and study the binding of two holes .",
    "it is informative to study the finite - size dependence of the energy on the lattice dimensions in both directions : in particular , it decays exponentially as a function of the lattice size perpendicular to the stripe , which we explain quantitatively in terms of the stripe tunneling through a barrier between two potential wells .",
    "one of the motivations for studying our model is our interest in a simple model of interacting stripes . in sec .",
    "[ sec - twoandmore ] we have exactly diagonalized systems with two , three , and four stripes , and find that the stripes repel .",
    "the interaction energies scale as the inverse square of the stripe spacing , which ( like the above - mentioned tunneling ) follows from the one - dimensional nature of the stripe s transverse motion in our systems .",
    "finally ( sec .",
    "[ sec - stripearray ] ) we discuss the stability of an array of stripes by fitting the diagonalization results in the intermediate filling limit and using a maxwell construction .",
    "our interest is whether at the intermediate - filling limit we have the stripe - array case or a phase - separated case with hole - rich regions and particle rich - regions .",
    "the conclusion is , interestingly , that the boson stripe - array is not stable and the fermion stripe - array is very close to the stability limit and is possibly stable .    our earlier publication , ref .",
    ", contains some of the results of this paper in a condensed form , with a focus on the stability of the stripe - array .",
    "the present paper contains more systematic and more updated results and a substantial number of important new results on , for example , boson and fermion statistics , stripe effective mass and stripe - stripe interaction .",
    "in this section , we describe our exact diagonalization code .",
    "we begin by describing the conventions for labeling basis states , which are crucial to keep track of sign factors in the fermion case .",
    "then we introduce a geometrical way to view the basis states as nodes on a graph , and apply this to classify the conditions under which the boson and fermion problems have the same .     on the left and @xmath30 on the right .",
    "site numbers are shown , following the numbering convention , upward and rightward . ]",
    "each basis state with @xmath31 particles corresponds 1-to-1 to a _ configuration _ , which is array of the @xmath31 occupied site numbers @xmath32 .",
    "any configuration with two nearest neighbors occupied is excluded because of the infinite @xmath13 in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq - ham ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are specified by two lattice vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( which will be called _ boundary vectors _ in the following ) , such that for any lattice vector @xmath35 we have @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two integers .",
    "the configuration by itself is insufficient to define the basis ket , since we need to specify its sign or phase factor . to fix the fermion sign",
    ", we must establish an arbitrary ordering of sites and always configurations in this order .",
    "then we denote the basis state @xmath39 ,    the site ordering convention used in this paper is to start with site 0 at the lower left corner and move upward along a lattice column until we encounter the cell boundaries defined by the boundary vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 , then shift rightward and repeating in the next column , progressing until all sites have been numbered . fig .",
    "[ fig-2lattice ] shows two example systems : @xmath40 and @xmath30 .    in this basis",
    "the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq - ham ] ) acts as @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the set of states created by hopping one particle in @xmath43 to an allowed nearest - neighbor site . for bosons @xmath44 always and for fermions @xmath45 .",
    "and the matrix element is @xmath46 if @xmath47 and 0 , otherwise .",
    "we use lattice translation symmetry to block diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix @xmath48 . the eigenstates that we use",
    "are the bloch states@xcite @xmath49 in this expression @xmath50 is a reciprocal lattice vector ( one of @xmath51 , where @xmath51 is the number of sites ) , @xmath52 is a lattice vector ( the order of @xmath53 in the sum is not important ) , @xmath54 is translation by @xmath52 , and @xmath55 is a normalization factor .",
    "the original basis states @xmath43 are divided by translation into classes and any two states in the same class give the same bloch state with an overall phase factor .",
    "a representative is chosen from each class and is used consistently to build the bloch states .",
    "for a state @xmath43 we denote its representative @xmath56 , and the hamiltonian matrix is block diagonal in the sense that @xmath57 when @xmath58 .",
    "the matrix @xmath59 is diagonalized for each @xmath60 vector using the well - known lanczos method .",
    "it is helpful conceptually to represent specific cases of our hamiltonian by the _ state graph _ , in an abstract ( or high - dimensional ) space , such that each node corresponds to a basis state , and two nodes are joined by an edge of the graph if and only if the two states differ by one particle hop .",
    "( as used in sec .  [ sec - graphhop ] , our many - body hamiltonian is almost equivalent to a single particle hopping on the state graph . )",
    "the best - known precedent of this approach s trugman s study of one - hole and two - hole hopping in the @xmath12@xmath27 model  @xcite .",
    "two states are _ connected _ if one state can be changed to another by a succession of hops . for states near half filling , our @xmath61 constraint forbids many hop moves , so the graph is sparse and can possess interesting topological properties relevant to our spectrum .",
    "we remarked ( fig .",
    "[ fig - hole ] ) that an isolated hole is unable to hop ; larger finite `` droplets '' of holes are still immobile , though they may gain kinetic energy from internal fluctuations .",
    "specifically , @xcite if one draws a rectangle with edges at @xmath62 to the lattice around the droplet , so as to enclose every site which deviates from the checkerboard order , then ( with the @xmath61 constraint ) sites outside this rectangle can never be affected by fluctuations of the droplet .    due to the droplets , the state graph ( representing all states with @xmath31 particles ) may be broken up into many disconnected components , states which can not access each other by allowed hops .",
    "this happens if both boundary vectors are even vectors , so that the system cell would support half filling with a perfect checkerboard order . for slightly less than half filling ,",
    "the _ typical _ basis state consists of scattered immobile droplets of the kind just described .",
    "each component corresponds to a different way to assign the holes to droplets , or merely a shifted way of placing the same droplets .",
    "each sort of droplet has its characteristic energy levels  @xcite and the system energies are the sum , just like a system of noninteracting atoms , each having its independent excited levels .    when the state graph is disconnected , the hilbert space is correspondingly blocked into components which are not connected by matrix elements .",
    "this is beyond the blocking according to translational symmetry , which remains true .      in systems with even - even boundary conditions",
    ", we are not mainly interested in the configurations with droplets , but in those with two stripes .",
    "@xcite since these are disconnected from the rest of the hilbert space , it speeds up the the diagonalization by a large factor if it is limited to the stripe - configuration subblock of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the only way to separate out this subblock is to generate basis states iteratively from a starting configuration which has two stripes .",
    "what of the case of even - odd or ( equivalently ) odd - odd boundary conditions ?",
    "these force _ one _ stripe ( possibly with additional holes , or possibly more stripes ) . in every such case ( excluding @xmath63 with odd @xmath64 )",
    ", the stripe can fluctuate and absorb any droplets , so we believe the hilbert space is fully connected , and the diagonalization is not speeded up .",
    "nevertheless , for every case near half - filling , we enumerated the basis from a starting configuration , as ( we believe ) this is the fastest way to do so .",
    "systematically enumerating all possible fillings by brute force would take more time than the diagonalization itself , since almost every brute - force trial configuration gets ruled out by the @xmath61 constraint .    however , at low fillings ( which we study in ref .  )",
    "the brute - force enumeration is used . in that case , if we generated from a starting configuration , there would be too many alternate routes to reach a given state .",
    "hence much time would be wasted in searches to check whether each newly reached state was already on the basis state list .",
    "below we outline the algorithm for building the basis states and the hamiltonian matrix .    .",

    "[ sec - diagstripe ] which describes graphically the relationship among the basis states . for the problems of a single stripe , holes on a stripe , and a few stripes , we investigated the effect of particle statistics on eigenenergy , with the help of the state graph and our computer program . and for the problem of stripe - array stability",
    ", we obtain from diagonalization results an interesting conclusion that the boson stripe - array is not stable and the fermion stripe - array is very close to the stability limit and is possibly stable .    this paper taken as a whole is an attempt to understand stripes as macroscopic objects arising from microscopic components ( the spinless fermion and hardcore boson particles in our model ) .",
    "the underlying physics is the quantum mechanics of the component particles that is described by a many - particle schrodinger equation ( which we solve by exact diagonalization ) .",
    "stripes can perhaps be called an _ emergent phenomenon _ and are results of collective motions of many microscopic particles ( the original particles or holes ) .",
    "they can perhaps be considered in the same fashion as phonons arising from collective lattice vibrations . and",
    "like phonons , the stripes in our problem have a life of their own , and we have tried , in this paper , to understand the new physics they bring .",
    "this paper is one of the first using exact diagonalization to study stripes .",
    "this is possible because of the significant hilbert space reduction afforded by our model eq .",
    "( [ eq - ham ] ) , spinless fermions and hardcore bosons with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "we believe that this is one of the simplest microscopic lattice model with which to study stripes from the underlying particle dynamics . and",
    "as we commented in our other paper on the dilute limit of this model,@xcite this model deserves to be better known and better studied .",
    "there are a number of directions in which the work of this paper might be extended .",
    "for example , our code handles quite arbitrary periodic boundary conditions , not necessarily rectangular or square .",
    "our key use of this feature was to accurately measure the equation of state for the strongly interacting liquid at density @xmath276 , as used in sec .",
    "[ sec - stability ] to decide the stripe - array stability . by including a wide variety of differently shaped fermion systems in fig .",
    "[ fig - fit ] ( top plot ) , in effect we average out the `` noise '' ( which is due to fermion shell effects  @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative way to do the same thing , which we have not implemented in the present work , would be to impose a phase factor across the boundary conditions and average over all phases .",
    "@xcite    a boundary condition could be used to investigate the 90@xmath285 bend of a stripe , which was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - stripe90 ] .",
    "these would force a diagonal stripe , as in fig .",
    "[ fig-45hole ] , but additional holes would be added to the stripe which are expected to condense and form a segment at right angles . that geometry would permit estimation of the energy cost of the @xmath286 bend .",
    "this study has focused entirely on eigenenergies ; since our diagonalizations provide the wavefunctions too , we could have computed a variety of informative expectations , such as correlation functions .",
    "we did make qualitative observations using snapshots of the high - weighted configurations . in our diagonalizations with two or more stripes ( sec .",
    "[ sec-3and4stripe ] ) , which started from a state with stripes all merged , the highest - weight state in the ground state eigenvector has stripes far apart from each other , and nearly equally spaced , as expected from the one - dimensional approximate wavefunctions of sec .",
    "[ sec - twoandmore ] .",
    "calculation of the probability distribution for the stripe separation would provide a quantitative test of those wavefunctions .",
    "similar calculations would give a more direct check of the exponential decay of the hole probability as a function of its distance from a stripe , as predicted in sec .",
    "[ sec - doublewell2 ] ; and would immediately reveal the attractive or repulsive tendency of two holes on a stripe ( sec .",
    "[ sec - stripe90 ] ) .",
    "we studied the case of _ one _ stripe with _ two _ holes ; the case of _ two _ stripes with _",
    "one _ hole is also worth investigating .",
    "the finite - size dependence of the extra energy due to the hole would shed light on the processes by which the hole is transferred between stripes when they touch .",
    "such processes are critical to the transport properties of the stripe array , as considered in refs .   in the spinfull case .",
    "up to here , we discussed further kinds of measurements which could be made on the same model system ; variations are also possible of the model itself .",
    "the most obvious of these is to treat @xmath268 .",
    "a large but finite @xmath13 may be handled in the spirit of the @xmath12-@xmath24 : the same highly restricted basis states ( which facilitated our diagonalizations ) are retained , but new hopping terms along [ 2,0 ] and [ 1,1 ] type vectors appear , with amplitudes @xmath287 , wherever the intervening site would be forbidden by the nearest - neighbor exclusion .",
    "it is not obvious whether this tends to stabilize or to destabilize the stripe array .",
    "the inclusion of another form of correlated hopping ( ref .  , fig .",
    "3(c ) ) can certainly stabilize or destabilize the stripe array depending on its sign .",
    "@xcite    finally , the same code is adaptable , almost without modifications , to the triangular lattice . that may model @xmath22he or @xmath21he atoms adsorbed on graphite or on carbon nanotubes ,  @xcite which implement a periodic boundary condition in one direction .",
    "we acknowledge support by the national science foundation under grant dmr-9981744 .",
    "we thank g.  g.  batrouni for helpful discussions .",
    "we find the number of basis states @xmath288 is maximum for fillings @xmath289 , close to the filling @xmath290 at which , in the thermodynamic limit , ( see sec .  [ sec - stability ] ) a hole - rich liquid coexists with the half - filled state or the ( nearly - half - filled ) stripe array state .",
    "this count may be estimated by adapting pauling s trick for the ice model entropy  @xcite .",
    "the number of ways merely to distribute @xmath31 particles over @xmath51 sites , uncontrained , is @xmath291 implying the usual entropy @xmath292 as @xmath293 ; this must be corrected to account for the constraint of no nearest neighbors .",
    "one chosen particle has a probability @xmath294 to be free of nearest neighbors .",
    "if we pretend this event is independent as each particle on ( say ) the even lattice is chosen in turn , then the @xmath295 power of this probability is the chance for the whole configuration to be valid .",
    "the net entropy is estimated as @xmath296 ; this attains its maximum @xmath297 around @xmath298 . implying the leading dependence @xmath299 for the @xmath61 spinless case , compared to @xmath300 in the hubbard model case .",
    "in fact , for a @xmath17 lattice , the block with @xmath301 particles has the largest ( translation - reduced ) matrix dimension , @xmath302 .",
    "let @xmath303 be the number of basis states ( per @xmath50 vector ) in a configuration with @xmath304 stripes and @xmath223 holes on it .",
    "this grows exponentially with @xmath114 but comparatively slowly with @xmath116 , so we can handle quite large @xmath116 , and moderately large @xmath114 .      the number of states with two stripes may be estimated by placing them independently  the correction from disallowing overlaps is subdominant .",
    "that is the square of the one - stripe count , multiplied by @xmath308 for the possible vectors offsetting one stripe relative to the other , i.e. @xmath309 .",
    "@xmath310 .    for one stripe with one hole ,",
