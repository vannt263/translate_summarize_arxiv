    "the stochastic fluctuations of a broad range of physical systems @xcite exhibit a behavior commonly denoted as _ anomalous diffusion_. the random motion is characterized by the scaling of a mean squared coordinate , which ( when averaged over many realizations ) scales as @xmath1 in time @xmath2 . for `` normal '' diffusion @xmath3 , while the cases of @xmath4 are referred to as `` anomalous , '' with @xmath5 , corresponding to _ sub - diffusion _ , while @xmath6 describes _ super - diffusion_. the physical origin of anomalous behavior is usually the coupling of the particle ( or some other coordinate ) to many other degrees of freedom , such that its dynamics is the superposition of numerous other modes with widely distributed time scales . in principle , there is no reason to expect any `` universality '' in such anomalous processes , and any two situations described by the same exponent @xmath7 may have very different characteristics .",

    "the behavior of a normal diffuser confined by absorbing boundaries is well understood ; in particular , for large times @xmath2 the survival probability @xmath8 of such a diffuser decays exponentially .",

    "we analyze the sub - diffusive motion of a tagged monomer which is part of an ideal ( gaussian ) 1d polymer . while the entire polymer performs diffusive ( monte carlo ) dynamics , we record the position of a single monomer at the mid - point of the chain . in the absence of absorption , this is a simple , analytically solvable problem , and the exact pdf of the monomer position is easily obtained .",

    "some recent studies  @xcite suggest that the translocation process maybe even slower than dictated by the relaxation of the rouse modes .",
    "if so , this would weaken the analogy between the translocation and the anomalous diffusion of a monomer .",
    "( the accuracy of these claims is questioned in further work @xcite . )    to the extent that one may draw an analogy between translocation and anomalous diffusion in the presence of absorbing boundaries , one may inquire whether the mean translocation time is finite .",
    "reference  @xcite argues that translocation may be described by a fractional diffusion equation , and consequently require an infinite mean time , as found in the solutions of such equation  @xcite .",
    "a similar point is made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a detailed study of the pdf of translocation times is fitted to a slowly decaying function for large times . however , direct ( experimental and numerical ) measurements appear to indicate well defined average translocation times .",
    "our results offer a model where absorption times of an anomalous diffuser are finite .",
    "clearly more detailed studies of translocation are needed to resolve this question .    in this work we studied in detail the sub - diffusion of a tagged monomer in a gaussian polymer . in the absence of absorption",
    "all properties can be derived analytically . however , upon inclusion of absorbing walls , we had to resort to numerical simulations .",
    "while we can characterize all properties of the numerical results , we are still missing an equation that can describe the evolution of the pdf of the position of the tagged particle .",
    "in fact , the numerical results exclude several simple forms for such an equation .      25 b. b. mandelbrot and j. w. van ness , siam rev . * 1 * , 422 ( 1968 ) ; s. c. lim and s. v. muniandy , phys . rev .",
