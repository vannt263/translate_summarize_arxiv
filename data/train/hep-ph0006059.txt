    "quark matter at high density provides an interesting laboratory for the controlled study of non - perturbative physics @xcite .",
    "novel phenomena such as color superconductivity and color - flavor locking have been shown to result from physics near the quark fermi surface .",
    "rigorous results can be obtained in the limit of asymptotic density .",
    "less , however , is known about what happens at intermediate densities , where the effective qcd coupling is still large .",
    "the intermediate density region is more likely to be realized in neutron star cores or laboratory experiments .    the t hooft anomaly matching conditions @xcite constrain the realizations of chiral symmetry in the low energy phase of a gauge theory .",
    "in this paper we investigate whether these conditions , orginally derived at zero density , can be used to constrain the behavior of matter at non - zero density .",
    "there are several obstacles to this generalization .",
    "a basic observation is that lorentz symmetry , which is broken at non - zero matter density , plays an important role in the original derivation of these matching conditions @xcite , and in the physics of the anomaly . in gauge theories at zero density , unbroken global chiral symmetries imply the existence of massless spin-@xmath0 states . as elaborated in @xcite , these degrees of freedom are responsible for the ir singularities associated with the anomaly .",
    "it is not at all obvious that the same considerations apply to the quasiparticles comprising the low - energy spectrum at finite density . yet , as noted by sannino @xcite , the various phases of color superconductivity do indeed satisfy the anomaly matching conditions .",
    "t hooft s original argument for his anomaly matching conditions involves the use of `` spectator '' fermions to cancel any anomalies which result from the gauging of flavor symmetries . in the low energy limit of the theory ,",
    "one is left only with the massless states ( composite or elementary ) and the spectator fermions .",
    "if this long - wavelength theory is to be consistent , the anomaly generated by the spectators must be cancelled by that of the other massless states .",
    "this argument can be repeated in the case of finite density , with gapless quasiparticles playing the role of massless fermions in the low - energy effective theory . however , due to the existence of a fermi surface there is a large degeneracy of zero energy states .",
    "naively , one might expect an enhancement of the anomaly prefactor by an amount proportional to the area of the fermi surface , which scales like @xmath1 ( the square of the chemical potential ) .",
    "clearly , we need to understand more precisely how quasiparticles contribute to the anomaly",
    ".    we will show that the anomaly matching conditions ( amcs ) continue to apply at finite density , and constrain the possible quasiparticle spectrum @xcite .",
    "in essence , the singularity structure of the three - current correlator implied by the anomaly must be reproduced by the effects of quasiparticles in the finite density theory , thereby constraining their flavor quantum numbers . applying the landau - cutkowsky rules",
    ", we see that only quasiparticles satisfying special kinematic conditions contribute to the singularity ",
    "there is no degeneracy factor due to the fermi surface .",
    "we focus our attention on cold but dense matter theories while a discussion of the anomaly at finite temperature can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the computation of the anomaly at finite density and show that it is unaffected by the presence of a chemical potential .",
    "further , the anomaly continues to imply the existence of ir singularities , even at non - zero density . in section 3",
    "we use the landau - cutkowsky rules to show that these singularities ( in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking ) require the existence of gapless quasiparticles in the low energy spectrum .",
    "in this section we show that the anomaly is unaffected by the presence of a chemical potential , as are the implications for singularities of the three current correlator .",
    "heuristically , density effects are ir in nature whereas the anomaly can be computed from the uv behavior of the theory .",
    "points ( a ) and ( b ) below follow simply from this observation , although ( c ) does not .",
    "* a. * the standard derivation of the anomaly from the point of view of uv divergencies involves the careful treatment of the variation of the fermionic partition function @xcite @xmath2~,\\ ] ] under the infinitesimal change of variables @xmath3 although the action in the exponent of the integrand is invariant under ( [ chirot ] ) , the fermionic measure @xmath4 is not : @xmath5 .",
    "the jacobian determinant @xmath6 is evaluated using gauge invariant regularization in the basis of the eigenstates of dirac operator @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    note , that if the chemical potential is not zero , one may still define the measure in the basis of the eigenstates of dirac operator with zero chemical potential .",
    "all further considerations follow the same path and produce the familiar result @xmath10\\ ] ] this implies that the anomaly equation for the axial current will take the same form at non - zero fermion density : @xmath11    * b. * it is known that the anomalies arise via quantum corrections , ( i.e. renormalization ) . in particular axial anomalies are associated , in a diagrammatic language , with triangular diagrams .    the three point function in electrodynamics is : ( the generalization to non - abelian theories is straightforward ) @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 vector and axial currents respectively .",
    "since the anomaly is independent of a fermion mass , we set it to be zero .",
    "the classical axial ward identity @xmath16 is modified according to ( for a more detailed discussion see @xcite before and after formulae ( 6.31 - 32 ) ) : @xmath17 with @xmath18 \\",

    "the integrals are linearly divergent , it can be shown that ( at zero density ) a translation of the integration variable produces extra finite terms ruining the classical ward identity .",
    "it is natural to ask what happens to the triangle anomaly at finite matter density . in principle",
    ", the contributions from triangle diagrams could depend on the chemical potential @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "we compute the difference @xmath27 parameterizing a possible deviation in the anomaly calculations .",

    "thus , for any finite density we have no extra contribution to the axial anomaly with the respect to the zero density one .",
    "adler and bardeen @xcite showed , at zero density , that the axial anomaly coefficient is one loop exact .",
    "we expect this theorem to hold at finite density , although we will not attempt to provide a proof .",
    "heurisitcally we can say that the introduction of a density term does not affect the superficial degree of divergence of the higher - order triangle diagrams with respect to the zero density case .",
    "since the latter have a lower degree of divergence with the respect to the simple triangle diagram we have no momentum - routing ambiguity and hence vanishing contribution to the anomaly .    *",
    "c. * at zero density the anomaly implies an ir singularity in the three - point function ( [ t ] ) involving vector and axial currents @xcite .",

    "we again interpret this singularity as due to massless excitations . in the case of unbroken chiral symmetry",
    "it implies the existence of gapless excitations with the charges necessary to match the zero density anomaly .",
    "it is important to note that this singularity does _ not _ imply that the anomalous decay @xmath71 is unaffected by finite density effects ( see @xcite ) . in medium ,",
    "the gauge boson acquires a plasma mass , and hence the physical decay takes place at non - zero energy . at such kinematic points",
    "we can not isolate the singularity cleanly , and density effects are possible .    in order to better clarify how the infrared singularities emerge at finite density",
    ", we investigate the singularity properties of quasiparticle scattering in the following section .",
    "since the anomaly equation ( [ axial ] ) is unmodified by finite density effects , we can apply t hooft s spectator fermion construction to conclude that quasiparticles must generate the same anomalies as the fundamental fermions . in this section",
    "we examine in more detail how this occurs .",
    "we are particularly interested in why the fermi surface degeneracy does not alter the result , and why massive excitations do not contribute to the anomaly .",
    "as discussed above , the anomaly at finite density still implies a @xmath72 pole in the function @xmath73 .",
    "we can use the landau - cutkowsky rules @xcite , to identify the intermediate states which are capable of providing this singularity .",
    "we first prove that the singularity structure is not modified by matter density effects .",
    "then we investigate the kinematics associated with the singularity to gain a better understanding of why this is the case .",
    "using the landau - cutkowsky rules @xcite , the discontinuity in the triangle graph is given by : @xmath74\\ ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & ~&\\theta\\left(p^0+k_1 ^ 0-\\mu\\right ) \\delta\\left[\\left(p+k_1-u\\right)^2\\right ] \\",

    "this integral no longer has any explicit dependence on the finite density term @xmath25 , and is identical to the integral obtained in the zero density case .",
    "we see that @xmath83 in the finite density case merely plays the role of the energy @xmath78 in the zero density case .",
    "hence the singularity structure is unchanged at finite density .    finally , we would like to understand why the fermi surface degeneracy does not affect the anomaly calculation . to this end , let us examine the on - shell kinematic conditions satisfied by the quasiparticles in ( [ disct ] ) .",
    "suppose we regard the triangle graph as a spacetime process , with the @xmath52 vertex earliest in time .",
    "let the incoming gauge boson momentum @xmath52 be null .",
    "in order that the quasiparticles with momenta @xmath22 and @xmath84 both be on - shell , @xmath85 and @xmath86 must be parallel .",
    "thus , a particular point on the fermi surface is selected by @xmath87 : the rest of the surface can not contribute to the singularity ( see figure [ fermi ] ) .",
    "( one of the particles emerging from the @xmath52 vertex is actually a quasihole on the opposite side of the fermi surface from the quasiparticle . which is which depends on whether @xmath86 and @xmath85 are aligned or anti - aligned .",
    ") finally , we note that if we take the energy of the gauge boson @xmath88 , we will not be able to produce quasiparticles whose energy spectrum has a gap : only gapless quasiparticles can reproduce the anomaly in the entire physical region .",
    "as shown , t hooft s anomaly matching conditions are as valid at non - zero matter density as at zero density .",
