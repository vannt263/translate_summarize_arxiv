    "in probing the properties of the weak interaction , superallowed @xmath5 nuclear beta decay has become a singularly valuable tool , principally because of its relative independence from the effects of nuclear structure , which are notoriously difficult to account for with high accuracy .",
    "since the measured @xmath5 transitions are between @xmath6 analog states , nuclear - structure effects only enter at the level of the differences between the parent and daughter wave functions .",
    "these differences , which are caused by coulomb and charge - dependent nuclear forces , turn out to be very small , and introduce a correction of order @xmath7 when the experimental @xmath8-values are used to extract a value for the effective weak vector coupling constant , @xmath9 .",
    "even a conservative estimate of the uncertainties in this correction indicate that structure - dependent uncertainties should not afflict the experimental determination of @xmath9 above the level of approximately @xmath10 . as a result",
    ", considerable effort has gone into making @xmath8-value measurements that achieve this level of experimental precision or better .    in this paper , we begin by summarizing the current status of world data on superallowed fermi beta decays and demonstrating the extent to which these data test the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis and the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "in fact , we show that the success of the measurements has been such that experiment has outstripped theory .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in calculated corrections  including the nuclear - structure - dependent charge - corrections  are now the limiting factor when superallowed beta decay is used to test the validity of the standard model . on the one hand , this can be viewed as a serious limitation to the continued usefulness of such measurements in future or , at least , as an indication that any improvements in their precision will have to be used to probe charge - dependence in nuclear structure rather than the fundamental properties of weak interactions . on the other hand , it can also be taken as a challenge to nuclear - structure theorists and experimenters alike to establish the effects of charge - dependence by independent means and thus to improve our ability overall to calculate them precisely .",
    "following our survey of world data , we outline the current approach to calculating charge - dependent effects , describe measurements that have been used to test these calculations independently , and consider future prospects for improved results . in particular , we shall consider the prospects for enlarging the sample of well - measured @xmath11 superallowed emitters , and examine what needs to be done before such measurements can usefully contribute to our fundamental understanding of the weak interaction .",
    "superallowed fermi @xmath0 nuclear beta decays @xcite provide both the best test of the cvc hypothesis in weak interactions and , together with the muon lifetime , the most accurate value for the up - down quark - mixing matrix element of the ckm matrix , @xmath12 .",
    "because the axial current can not contribute in lowest order to transitions between spin-0 states , the experimental @xmath8-value is related directly to the vector coupling constant .",
    "specifically , for an isospin-1 multiplet ,    ft ( 1 + _ r ) = , [ ft ]    with    ^ & = & ( 1 + ) ^1/2 , + ^2 & = & 2(1 - _ c ) , + k/(c)^6 & = & 2 ^3 2 / ( m_e c^2)^5 = ( 8120.271 0.012 ) 10 ^ -10 gev^-4 s , [ mk ]    where @xmath13 is the statistical rate function , @xmath14 is the partial half - life for the transition , @xmath15 is the fermi matrix element and @xmath1 is the primitive vector coupling constant .",
    "the physical constants used to evaluate @xmath16 were taken from the most recent particle data group publication @xcite .",
    "these equations also include three calculated correction terms  all of order @xmath7 .",
    "we write @xmath17 as the nucleus - dependent part of the radiative correction , @xmath18 as the nucleus - independent part of the radiative correction , and @xmath4 as the isospin symmetry - breaking correction . a general description of these three correction terms and the methods used in their calculation has appeared elsewhere @xcite . in the present context , it is sufficient to note that nuclear structure plays a small role in the determination of @xmath17 , but it is predominant for that of @xmath4 .",
    "equations  ( [ ft ] ) and  ( [ mk ] ) can now be combined into a form that is convenient for the analysis of experimental results :    t ft ( 1 + _ r ) ( 1 - _ c ) = .",
    "[ ft ]    here we have defined @xmath19 as the  corrected \" @xmath8-value . from this equation , it is evident that the @xmath19-values obtained from @xmath5 transitions in different nuclei can constitute a stringent test of cvc , which requires them all to be equal .    to date ,",
    "superallowed @xmath5 transitions have been measured to @xmath10 precision or better in the decays of nine nuclei ranging from @xmath2c to @xmath3co .",
    "world data on @xmath20-values , lifetimes and branching ratios  the results of over 100 independent measurements  were thoroughly surveyed @xcite in 1989 and then updated several times since , most recently for the wein98 conference @xcite .",
    "the resulting weighted averages are given in the first three columns of table [ exres ] .",
    "using the calculated electron - capture probabilities @xcite given in the next column , we obtain the  uncorrected \" @xmath8-values listed in column 5 with partial half - lives determined from the formula @xmath21 .",
    "[ t ]    .experimental results ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 and branching ratio , @xmath24 ) , electron - capture probabilities ( @xmath25 ) and calculated corrections ( @xmath17 and @xmath4 ) for @xmath5 transitions .",
    "[ exres ] [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath26 values for lighter superallowed fermi emitters , @xmath2c , @xmath27o , @xmath28al and @xmath29cl were obtained in a similar manner , as described in towner @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 = @xmath26 values are quite small , of the order of @xmath31 , but seem under reasonable control .",
    "the larger @xmath32 values associated with radial overlap integrals , potentially can have more uncertainty .",
    "we have found that our results based on using saxon - woods radial functions lead to systematically larger @xmath32 values than the calculations of ormand and brown @xcite with hartree - fock functions .",
    "we therefore allow for this systematic difference in our data analysis by using average values and introducing a systematic uncertainty to @xmath33 ( see equation([ftavg1 ] ) ) . in table",
    "[ t : tab2 ] we give our @xmath30 and @xmath32 values , together with those of ormand and brown , and our adopted final numbers , @xmath34 .",
    "these are the values that appear in table [ exres ] and are used to analyze the world data for superallowed @xmath35 decays .",
    "with the experimental evidence so far completely in support of the calculated values for @xmath4 , the current world data on superallowed @xmath36 beta decay are tantalizingly close to a result in definitive disagreement with ckm unitarity .",
    "naively one might expect such a situation would prompt an urgent new round of experiments with the goal of further reducing the quoted uncertainty in @xmath37 but , unfortunately , the next step can not be so straightforward .",
    "as we have already noted , the error bar associated with @xmath38 in equation  ( [ vud00 ] ) is now dominated by uncertainties in the calculated correction terms .",
    "any improvements in precision made within the existing body of experimental data will be effectively lost once the results are applied to the unitarity test so long as there are no improvements in the calculations .    clearly of highest priority in future",
    "must be to increase the precision of the correction terms , particularly @xmath18 , which is the largest contributor to the uncertainty of @xmath39 .",
    "its importance is manifest not only in the unitarity test based on superallowed @xmath40 beta decay but also in any tests based on neutron or pion decays . to date , the experimental data on these non - nuclear decays are considerably less precise @xcite than those on the @xmath36 transitions but , year by year , improvements are being made in the neutron - decay measurements largely motivated by the prospect of a unitarity test unfettered with the structure - dependent coulomb correction , @xmath4 , which vanishes for the neutron . in spite of this simplification in the neutron decay ,",
    "however , any potential advantage to the unitarity test is lost unless @xmath18 can be calculated with greater precision , since _ all _ determinations of @xmath39 depend directly on @xmath18 .    until such time",
    "as the @xmath18 calculation is refined and the neutron decay measurements rival the precision of the nuclear results , the best hope for improvements to the unitarity test lies in increasing our confidence in the calculated values of @xmath4 .",
    "though a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty in @xmath4 has been incorporated into the derivation of @xmath37 ( see tables [ exres ] and [ t : tab2 ] ) , there is no doubt that the dominant role of nuclear structure in the calculation of @xmath4 leaves some people questioning whether the real uncertainty is larger than the one actually quoted . under the circumstances ,",
    "any experiment that can probe the veracity of the @xmath4 calculations will make a valuable contribution to the whole problem .",
    "there are at least three different approaches that can be taken in devising such experiments .",
    "first , improvements can be sought in results for the nine superallowed transitions whose @xmath8-values are already known to within a fraction of a percent .",
    "this would not be a fruitless endeavour .",
    "it is certainly true that , given the large quantity of careful measurements now contributing to the content of table [ exres ] , there is little chance that the central value of @xmath33 will be changed significantly by a few more . and",
    ", it is also true that improvements in the experimental uncertainties will not be directly reflected in a reduced uncertainty for @xmath39 unless the @xmath18 correction has been improved too .",
    "but , the test of cvc can be made more demanding as the experimental precision is increased and , to the extent that the @xmath19-values continue to agree with one another , this would demonstrate at the same time the reliability of the @xmath4 calculations , which compensate for the transition - to - transition variations evident in the uncorrected @xmath8-values .",
    "of course , it is only the _ relative _ values of @xmath4 that can be tested by this method , but it would be a pathological fault indeed that could calculate in detail the required variations in @xmath4 while failing to obtain their _ absolute _ values to comparable precision .",
    "the various experimental and theoretical contributions to the @xmath19-value uncertainties are shown in fig.[fig2 ] for the nine superallowed transitions whose @xmath8 values are known to within a fraction of a percent . if we accept that it is valuable for experiment to be at least a factor of two more precise than the calculations for @xmath17 and @xmath4 ( _ relative _ uncertainties only ) , then an examination of fig.[fig2 ] shows that the q - values for @xmath2c , @xmath27o , @xmath28al and @xmath41v , the half - lives of @xmath2c , @xmath29cl and @xmath42k , and the branching ratio for @xmath2c can all bear improvement .",
    "such improvements will soon be feasible .",
    "the q - values will reach the required level ( and more ) as mass measurements with new on - line penning traps become possible ; half - lives will likely yield to measurements with higher statistics as high - intensity beams of separated isotopes are developed for radioactive - beam facilities ; and , finally , an improved branching - ratio measurement on @xmath2c has already been made with gammasphere and simply awaits analysis @xcite .",
    "another experimental approach to testing @xmath4 is offered by the possibility of increasing the number of superallowed emitters accessible to precision studies .",
    "the greatest attention recently has been paid to the @xmath43 ( odd - odd ) emitters with @xmath44 , since these nuclei are expected to be produced at new radioactive - beam facilities , and their calculated coulomb corrections , @xmath4 , are predicted to be large @xcite , as is illustrated in fig.[fig3 ] . in principle , then , they could provide a valuable test of the accuracy of @xmath4 calculations .",
    "it is likely , though , that these heavy emitters will not provide @xmath8-values with sufficient precision to be useful directly in extracting competitive @xmath19-values in the near future .",
    "all of the well known emitters listed in table [ exres ] , with the exception of @xmath2c , have the special advantage that the superallowed branch from each is by far the dominant transition in its decay ( @xmath45 99% ) .",
    "this means that the branching ratio for the superallowed transitions can be determined to high precision from relatively imprecise measurements of the other weak transitions , which can simply be subtracted from 100% .",
    "in contrast , the decays of the heavier @xmath46 emitters  nuclides such as @xmath47ga , @xmath48as , @xmath49br and @xmath50rb  will be of considerably higher energy and each will therefore involve several allowed transitions of significant intensity in addition to the superallowed transition .",
    "branching - ratio measurements will thus be very demanding , particularly with the limited radioactive - beam intensities likely to be available initially for these rather exotic nuclei .",
    "lifetime measurements will be similarly constrained by statistics . as to the @xmath22 values",
    ", even penning traps will be hard pressed to produce the required precision of a few parts in 10@xmath51 for the masses of these short - lived ( @xmath52 ms ) nuclides .",
    "more immediately achievable among these heavier superallowed emitters are measurements of the type described in the preceding section , in which non - analogue fermi transitions were observed @xcite and compared with model calculations as a test of the techniques used in calculating @xmath4 .",
    "such measurements would yield important information on coulomb mixing and they would be an important prerequisite for any serious attempt to obtain @xmath53-values in this region of nuclei",
    ". another important prerequisite would be the experimental determination of the coefficients of the imme for all relevant @xmath54 @xmath55 states .",
    "these demanding experiments are interesting in their own right but , as preliminaries to future @xmath19-value determinations , they are especially important because model calculations in this region of rapid shape changes are likely to be far less reliable than they are in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 shells . without the constraints provided by these experiments  and possibly even with them  tests of @xmath4 from the measured @xmath19-values could end up reflecting more about the limitations of the nuclear models used than about the underlying physics of the weak interaction . as a first probe of these issues ,",
    "an investigation of non - analogue fermi transitions from @xmath47ga is already underway @xcite .",
    "more will undoubtedly follow .    in the near future ,",
    "the most promising experimental approach that can actually increase the number of precisely measured @xmath19-values is to study the @xmath58 superallowed emitters with @xmath59 .",
    "there is good reason to explore them . for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the calculated value @xcite of @xmath4 for @xmath60s decay , though smaller than the @xmath4 s expected for the heavier nuclei , is actually 1.2%  about a factor of two larger than for any other case currently known  while @xmath61 mg has a very low value of 0.35% .",
    "if the @xmath8-values for these two nuclei can be determined to a precision of a few tenths of a percent or better , and the large predicted difference is confirmed , then it will do much to increase our confidence in the calculated coulomb corrections .",
    "this would be especially convincing since the calculation involves the same model space as was used for the presently known cases . to be sure , these decays will provide an experimental challenge , particularly in the measurement of their branching ratios , but the required precision should be achievable with isotope - separated beams that are currently available .",
    "in fact , such experiments are also in their early stages at the texas a&m cyclotron @xcite .",
    "the current world data on superallowed @xmath62 beta decays lead to a self - consistent set of @xmath19-values that agree with cvc but differ provocatively , though not yet definitively , from the expectation of ckm unitarity .",
    "there are no evident defects in the calculated radiative and coulomb corrections that could remove the problem , but suspicion continues to fall on the calculations of coulomb mixing , which depend sensitively on the details of nuclear structure . if any progress is to be made in firmly establishing ( or eliminating ) the discrepancy with unitarity , additional experiments are required that focus on this issue .",
    "we have indicated what some relevant nuclear experiments might be , and have particularly emphasized that experiments to measure the @xmath8-values of heavy @xmath46 odd - odd superallowed emitters with @xmath44 , which have been proposed for new radioactive - beam facilities , are very difficult and should be preceded by measurements in the same mass region of non - analogue fermi decays and imme coefficients .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the most important requirement for all tests of ckm universality that depend upon @xmath12 is an improved determination of the nucleus - independent radiative correction , @xmath18 .",
    "it is not only the results from nuclear superallowed decays that must be subjected to this correction term , but also the results from the neutron and pion decays if they also are to be used to extract @xmath12 . though the latter decays are currently known with less precision than the nuclear decays , one can reasonably expect them to improve significantly over the next decade .",
    "thus , it is of highest priority to reduce the uncertainty currently attached to the calculation of @xmath18 . that having been stated",
    ", it must be noted that nuclear decays will also require more reliable @xmath4 calculations to remain competitive , especially if the uncertainties are reduced on @xmath18 . in any case ,",
    "improved model calculations of nuclear structure and coulomb mixing in nuclei with @xmath63 and @xmath44 are an important requirement for the future if @xmath8-value measurements are to be attempted in this region .",
