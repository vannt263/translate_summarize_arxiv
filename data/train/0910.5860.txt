    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have been among the most important ingredients in the revolution of cosmology that has taken place in the last two decades , when cosmology changed from a data starved to a data rich science .",
    "the so far most influential observations have been made with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ; bennett et al .",
    "2003a ; hinshaw et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) satellite experiment , which has measured the microwave sky at five different frequencies ( 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94 ghz ) in both temperature and polarization .",
    "its main results are five sky maps with resolutions between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , each comprising more than three million pixels in each of the three stokes parameters i , q , and u.    the detector technology leading to instruments like _ wmap _ has thus been very important in observing the cmb .",
    "almost equally important has been the progress in computer technology and algorithms . with the enormously increased number of pixels from new high - resolution instruments , scientists have had to develop clever algorithms for every step of the required data analysis pipeline : map making ( e.g. , ashdown et al .",
    "2007 ; hinshaw et al . 2003b , and references therein ) , component separation ( e.g. , bennett et al .",
    "2003b ; leach et al .",
    "2008 ; eriksen et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) , power spectrum and cosmological parameter estimation ( e.g. , grski 1994 ; lewis & bridle 2002 ; hivon et al .",
    "2002 ; hinshaw et al . 2003a ; verde et al . 2003 ; eriksen et al . 2004d , and references therein ) , and analysis of higher - order statistics ( e.g. , hinshaw et al .",
    "1994 ; kogut et al . 1995 ; komatsu et al . 2003 ; eriksen et al . 2004c , 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper , we revisit a well - known example of the latter category , namely , real - space @xmath4-point correlation functions .",
    "these functions arise naturally in studies of non - gaussianity , since it can be shown that any odd - ordered @xmath4-point function has an identically vanishing expectation value , while all even - ordered @xmath4-point functions have an expectation value given by products of the corresponding two - point functions .",
    "violation of either of these relations would indicate the presence of a non - gaussian component in the field under consideration .",
    "earlier @xmath4-point correlation function analyses of cmb data include studies of the _",
    "cobe_-dmr data @xcite , the _ wmap _ temperature data @xcite and one single two - point analysis of the first - year _ wmap _ polarization data @xcite .",
    "this paper is the first to consider the much more mature five - year _ wmap _ polarization data , and the first to compute the three - point correlation function from any cmb polarization data . to do this ,",
    "we adopt and extend the @xmath4-point algorithms developed by @xcite .",
    "an @xmath4-point correlation function @xmath5 of a stochastic field @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 spans an @xmath4-polygon defined by @xmath9 parameters , @xmath10 . in the most general case in which no assumptions are made concerning the statistical properties of the field @xmath11",
    ", one needs @xmath12 parameters to uniquely describe such a polygon , namely , the individual positions of each vertex of the polygon .",
    "however , in many applications one assumes that @xmath11 is isotropic and homogeneous , and one can therefore average over position . in such cases , the number of parameters are reduced by three on a two - dimensional surface , corresponding to translation and rotation .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider only two- and three - point correlation functions defined on the two - dimensional sphere , and we therefore need , respectively , one and three parameters to describe our polygons ( ie . , line and triangle ) .",
    "in the two - point case , the only natural parameter choice is the angular distance , @xmath13 between the two points , while in the three - point case there is some freedom to choose . for simplicity , we parameterize the triangle by the lengths of the three edges , @xmath14 , where the edges are ordered such that @xmath15 corresponds to the longest of the three edges , and the remaining are listed according to clockwise traversal of the triangle .",
    "our goal in this paper is to measure the @xmath4-point correlation functions of the polarized _ wmap _ maps .",
    "to do so , we have to generalize the methods described by @xcite , in order to account for the fact that the cmb polarization field is a spin-2 field .",
    "explicitly , the full cmb fluctuation field may be described in terms of the three stokes parameters , i(@xmath16 ) , q(@xmath16 ) , and u(@xmath16 ) . here",
    "i is the usual ( scalar ) temperature fluctuation field , and q and u are two parameters describing the linear polarization properties of the radiation in direction @xmath16 .",
    "according to standard cmb conventions , q and u are defined with respect to the local meridian of the spherical coordinate system of choice .",
    "however , q and u form a spin-2 field , and this means that if one performs a rotational coordinate system transformation , the stokes parameters after transformation becomes @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the local rotation angle between the two coordinate systems . @xcite and @xcite give complete descriptions of the statistics of these fields .",
    "this property has some important consequences when computing @xmath4-point correlation functions : since we assume that the cmb field is isotropic and homogeneous , the value we obtain for a given element of the correlation function should not depend on the coordinate system .",
    "one can not therefore blindly adopt q and u as the quantities to correlate , since these are in fact coordinate dependent .",
    "for the two - point function , this problem is conventionally solved by defining a local coordinate system in which the local meridian passes through the two points of interest @xcite .",
    "the stokes parameters in this new `` radial '' system are denoted by q@xmath19 and u@xmath19 , and measure the polarization either orthogonally or perpendicularly ( q@xmath19 ) to the connecting line , or 45@xmath20 rotated with respect to it ( u@xmath21 ) .",
    "the two - point function defined in terms of q@xmath19 and u@xmath19 then becomes coordinate system independent .",
    "we now generalize this idea to higher - order @xmath4-point correlation functions . as with the definition of the @xmath4-point polygon parameters",
    ", we also here have some freedom when choosing the reference points for the coordinate independent quantities .",
    "for instance , two natural choices for q@xmath22 and u@xmath22 are to define them either with respect to the edges or with respect to the center of mass of the polygon , @xmath23 in this paper we choose the latter definition .",
    "the resulting geometry is illustrated in figure [ fig : coordinates ] .",
    "given these new rotationally invariant quantities , @xmath24 , defined with respect to the local center of mass , the polarized correlation functions are simply defined as @xmath25 note that in the case of the two - point function , there are six independent polarized correlation functions ( ii , iq@xmath19 , iu@xmath19 , q@xmath19q@xmath19 , q@xmath19u@xmath19 and u@xmath19u@xmath19 ) , while in the three - point function case , there are 27 independent components ( iii , iiq@xmath19 , @xmath26 , u@xmath19u@xmath19q@xmath19 , u@xmath19u@xmath19u@xmath19 ) .",
    "algorithmically , we compute these functions from a given pixelized sky map , @xmath27 , simply by averaging the corresponding products over all available pixel multiplets that satisfy the geometrical constraints of the polygon under consideration , @xmath28 here @xmath29 runs over the number of available pixel multiplets , and @xmath30 is the @xmath31th pixel in the @xmath32th pixel multiplet . for full details on how to find",
    "the relevant pixel multiplets corresponding to a given polygon efficiently , see @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions are binned with a bin size tuned to the pixel size of the map . explicitly , since we use a healpix resolution of @xmath33 , with @xmath34 pixels , we adopt a bin size of @xmath35 , for a total of 30 bins between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "if all factors in an @xmath4-point multiplet are taken from the same map , the resulting function is named an auto - correlation ; otherwise , it is called a cross - correlation .",
    "the main advantage of cross - correlations is that the noise is typically uncorrelated between maps , while the signal ( ideally ) is strongly correlated .",
    "therefore , the noise contribution to a cross - correlation averages to zero . for this reason",
    ", one typically uses auto - correlations as a probe of systematic errors ( e.g. , to check whether the assumed noise model is correct ) , but cross - correlations for a final cosmological analysis . in this paper",
    ", we consider both types .    in figure",
    "[ fig : theoryvsexp ] , we show a comparison of three two - point correlation functions computed from the same signal - only simulation , using two different methods : the red curves show the correlation functions computed from the power spectrum of the realization , employing the analytic expression given by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the black curves show the correlation functions computed directly from the pixelized map using the algorithms described above .",
    "slight differences are expected due to different treatment of pixel windows , but clearly the agreement between the two are excellent , giving us confidence that our machinery works as expected .      in this paper",
    "we perform a standard frequentist analysis , in the sense that we compare the results obtained from the real data with an ensemble of simulations based on some model . specifically , our null - hypothesis here is that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous , and filled with gaussian fluctuations drawn from a @xmath0cdm power spectrum .",
    "our ensemble consists of @xmath38 simulations .    for each realization in the ensemble",
    ", we compute the @xmath4-point correlation functions in precisely the same manner as for the real data .",
    "finally , we compare the correlation function derived from the data with the simulated functions through a standard @xmath39 statistic , @xmath40 where the sum runs over all @xmath4-point configurations / bins , and the mean @xmath41 and variance @xmath42 are derived from the simulations .    however , before computing the @xmath39 as described above , we gaussianize the distribution of each bin as follows @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the rank of the value under consideration ( i.e. , the number of simulations with a _ lower _",
    "value than the currently considered ) , and @xmath45 is the corresponding gaussianized rank . the reason for performing this transformation is that the probability distribution for a given bin is highly non - gaussian , and for even - ordered correlation functions strongly skewed toward high values .",
    "a direct @xmath39 evaluation will therefore tend to give too much weight to fluctuations that have high values compared to fluctuations that have low values . by first explicitly gaussianizing , a symmetric response is guaranteed .",

    "this allows us to distinguish between a case with @xmath551% significance and one with @xmath56% significance , but still recognize the importance of the monte carlo uncertainties .",
    "further , we conservatively never claim to obtain results with higher significance than 99% in any case , despite the fact that many results very likely are far more anomalous , as would be clear by using more simulations .",
    "in the following , we analyze the five - year _ wmap _ sky maps , including both temperature and polarization .",
    "these data are available from lambda , including all ancillary data , such as beam transfer functions , noise covariance matrices and foreground templates . the total data set spans five frequencies ( 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94 ghz ) , corresponding to the @xmath57 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 bands .",
    "our main objects of interest are the frequency co - added and foreground - reduced sky maps , which are provided in the form of healpix pixelized sky maps .",
    "the temperature sky maps are given at a healpix resolution of @xmath58 , while the polarization maps are given at @xmath33 .",
    "to bring the data into a common format , we therefore degrade the temperature component to the same resolution as the polarization maps , simply by averaging over sub - pixels in a low - resolution pixel .    for temperature",
    "we consider the @xmath47 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 bands , and for polarization also the @xmath46 band .",
    "this difference mirrors the official cosmological _ wmap _ analysis , which also uses the @xmath46 band for polarization , but considers the same band to be too foreground contaminated in temperature .",
    "our simulations are generated as follows : we first draw a random gaussian cmb realization from the best - fit five - year _ wmap _",
    "@xmath0cdm power spectrum , including multipole moments up to @xmath59 .",
    "this realization is then convolved with the instrumental beam of each _ wmap _ differencing assembly and the @xmath60 healpix pixel window , and projected onto a healpix grid . for temperature",
    ", we then add a gaussian noise realization with pixel - dependent variance , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the noise variance per observation and @xmath63 is the number of observations in that given pixel .",
    "the temperature component is then degraded to @xmath33 .    for the polarization component , we first degrade the high - resolution map to @xmath33 , and then add a noise term .",
    "this is because the polarized noise description for _ wmap _ is given by a full noise covariance matrix , @xmath64 at @xmath33 , and not as a simple @xmath63 count at high resolution .",
    "the correlated noise realization is generated by drawing a vector of standard normal variates , @xmath65 , and multiplying this vector by the cholesky factor of the covariance matrix , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .    for temperature ,",
    "we adopt two different masks , namely the five - year _ wmap _ kq85 and kq75 masks . these exclude 18% and 28% of the sky , respectively .",
    "for the polarization component , there is only one relevant mask in the five - year _ wmap _ data release , which excludes 27% of the sky .",
    "two different polarized foreground templates are used in the following .",
    "the first is simply the difference between the @xmath57 and @xmath46 bands , smoothed to an effective resolution of @xmath68 to reduce noise , which traces synchrotron radiation .",
    "the second template is the same starlight template as used for foreground correction in the five - year _ wmap _ data release , which traces thermal dust .",
    "in this section we present the two- and three - point correlation functions computed from the polarized five - year _ wmap _ data . due to the large number of available and unique correlation functions one can form within this data set , we plot only a few selected cases , and instead show the full set of results only in the form of tabulated significances .      in figure [ fig : twopt_auto ] ,",
    "we show a selection of two - point correlation functions derived from the _ wmap _ data .",
    "specifically , all available @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath49 auto - correlations are shown , in addition to the cross - correlations between the @xmath46 and @xmath50 bands . table [ tab : twopt ] shows the @xmath39 significances for all possible two - point functions from the available data .",
    "( note that only unique combinations are actually shown ; empty table cells indicate that the same combinations may be found elsewhere in the table .",
    "for example , iq and qi are identical for auto - correlations , but different for cross - correlations . )    starting with the pure intensity correlations shown in the top row of figure [ fig : twopt_auto ] , we recognize the by now well - known behavior of the cmb temperature two - point function , observed both by _ cobe _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and _ wmap _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : at small angular separations , it is slightly low compared to the @xmath0cdm model , and at separations larger than @xmath69 , very close to zero .",
    "this peculiar behavior has attracted the interest of both experimentalists and theorists , and some have suggested that this could be the signature of a closed topological space .",
    "however , from the view of a simple @xmath39 test , this function remains consistent with the simplest @xmath0cdm model at the 5%10% level .",
    "next , looking at the temperature - polarization ( i - q / u ) cross - correlations we see that the overall behavior of the @xmath47- , @xmath49 , and @xmath70 band functions are quite different .",
    "this indicates that the _ wmap _ data still are too noise dominated to extract high - sensitivity cosmological information from individual bands .",
    "this is also reflected in the second and third columns of table [ tab : twopt ] , where there is a significant scatter between the different results .",
    "however , we do see that all results are in good agreement with the expectations , indicating that the noise model is satisfactory .",
    "the three bottom rows of figure [ fig : twopt_auto ] show the pure polarization correlation functions , which are the main target in this paper . and here we see several interesting features .",
    "first , we recognize a sharp feature in the uu correlation function at @xmath71 .",
    "this is the angular separation between the a- and b sides of the differential _",
    "detectors , and it was also seen in the pure noise temperature two - point correlation function in the first - year _ wmap _ data @xcite",
    ".    however , even more interesting is the overall very pronounced large - scale excesses seen in the qq and uu functions : both the @xmath47- and @xmath49-band functions lie mostly within the @xmath72-@xmath73 confidence regions , and the overall agreement with the simulations appears quite poor .",
    "again , this is strongly reflected in table [ tab : twopt ] : all qq correlations are anomalous at more than 99% confidence , and all uu correlations at more than 98% confidence . in the case of the @xmath74band , which happens to be the most anomalous of any band",
    ", we have good reasons to expect such behavior .",
    "this band has a significantly higher @xmath75 knee frequency than any other band @xcite , with the @xmath504 differencing assembly having the highest . as a result ,",
    "the _ wmap _ team has chosen not to use this band for cosmological analysis in polarization . but the anomalous behavior of the @xmath47 and @xmath49 bands is a priori not expected ; these are used for cosmological analysis by the _ wmap _ team and should be clean .",
    "we have also generated an ensemble of noise - only simulations , and computed the two - point functions from these .",
    "the corresponding @xmath39 fractions are listed in parentheses in table [ tab : twopt ] for the pure polarization modes . here",
    "we see that , generally speaking , the noise - only hypothesis performs almost , but not quite , as well as the signal - plus - noise hypothesis .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the _ wmap _ polarization data are strongly dominated by the correlated noise , and it is very difficult from a correlation function point of view to distinguish between a small signal component and a large - scale noise fluctuation .",
    "the anomalous behavior seen in the @xmath47- and @xmath49-band two - point functions clearly needs an explanation . and",
    "typically , when such unexpected behavior is observed , one of the the first issues to consider is residual foregrounds .    to check whether this may be a relevant issue , we first simply compute the cross - correlation functions between each of the three frequency bands ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath49 ) and the two available foreground templates ( synchrotron and dust ) .",
    "this is done both for the real _ wmap _ data and the simulated ensembles , and the agreement between the ( pure cmb @xmath76 noise ) simulations and the _ wmap _ data is again quoted in terms of a @xmath39 fraction .",
    "the results from these calculations are as follows : for the @xmath46 band , we find that the @xmath39 significances are 0.51 and 0.24 for synchrotron and dust , respectively , indicating no significant foreground detection in this case .",
    "however , for the @xmath47 band the corresponding numbers are 0.05 and @xmath77 , corresponding to correlations statistically significant at @xmath72 and @xmath78 , respectively . for the @xmath49 band ,",
    "the numbers are 0.05 and 0.02 , significant at @xmath72 or more .    to study these foreground correlations further , we compute the two - point functions from the foreground templates directly , and fit these to the observed correlation functions with a single free amplitude for each template , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , by minimizing @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is the correlation function mean and @xmath83 is the covariance matrix , both quantities obtained from the noise simulations .",
    "the indices @xmath84 run over all possible pure polarization two - point bins ( i.e. , both angular bins and qq , qu , and uu correlations ) .",
    "the resulting best - fit amplitudes from this calculation for @xmath46- , @xmath47- and @xmath49 bands are shown in table [ tab : amp_marg_conf ] . here , we again see that the @xmath46-band amplitudes are generally significantly lower than those of the @xmath47 and @xmath49 bands .",

    "however , we note that the three - point function is primarily used in the literature as a test of non - gaussianity . in the present case",
    ", this will not be case , since we have already seen that the data appear to be foreground contaminated , and even the two - point correlation function fails a standard @xmath39 test .",
    "the following three - point analysis will therefore essentially only be a consistency check of the above results , and a demonstration of the general procedure , to be further developed in the future , when cleaner data become available .",
    "we consider only cross - correlations of pure polarization modes for the cosmologically interesting frequency channels .",
    "this leaves us with only eight independent correlation function modes ( qqq , quq , uqq , uuu etc . ) , and only one frequency combination ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "further , we consider only two general types of three - point configurations , namely , equilateral and pseudo - collapsed triangles .",
    "the latter is defined such that two legs of the triangle are of equal length , while the third leg spans an angular distance of less than @xmath94 .",
    "the results from these calculations are tabulated in table [ tab : threept ] , and a few arbitrarily chosen modes of the equilateral three - point functions are plotted in figure [ fig : threept_eq ] .",
    "( plotting all functions would take too much space , without adding any particular new insights . )",
    "once again , we see that the @xmath39 s obtained from the real data are high , but generally not quite as striking as in the two - point case .",
    "this is at least partly due to the fact that the @xmath46 band is involved in all configurations , as well as the fact that the three - point function is always `` noisier '' than the two - point function .",
    "we also see that the noise - only hypothesis always has higher @xmath39 s than the signal - plus - noise hypothesis , again following the two - point behavior .",
    "it is difficult to interpret these results much further , given that there are clear problems already at the two - point level .",
    "we therefore leave a full interpretation of the three - point function to a future publication , when cleaner data , either from _ wmap _ or _ planck _ , have been made available .",
    "we compute for the first time the polarized two- and three - point correlation functions from the five - year _ wmap _ data , with the initial motivation of constraining possible non - gaussian signals on large scales in the cmb polarization sector . however , our main result is a detection of a signature consistent with residual foregrounds in both the @xmath47- and @xmath49-band data , significant at @xmath72-@xmath73 .",
    "this should not come as a complete surprise , though , as a similar result was found in the three - year _ wmap _ data through a direct template fit approach by @xcite .",
    "they used a gibbs sampling implementation to estimate the joint cmb power spectrum and foreground template posterior , and found non - zero template amplitudes at similar significance levels when marginalizing over the cmb spectrum .",
    "given the results found in the present paper , this still appears to be an important issue for the five - year _ wmap _ data release .",
    "resolving this question is of major importance for the cmb community , since many cosmological parameters depend critically on the large - scale _ wmap _ polarization data , most notably the optical depth of reionization , @xmath95 , and the spectral index of scalar perturbations , @xmath96 .    the question of primordial non - gaussianity in cmb polarization data can not be meaningfully addressed as long as this issue is unresolved .",
    "the three - point correlation function results shown in this paper therefore mostly serve as a demonstration of the approach , and as a cross - check on the two - point results .",
    "the three - point function will obviously become a more important and independent quantity in the future , when higher - fidelity polarization data become available .",
    "we acknowledge use of the healpix software @xcite and analysis package for deriving the results in this paper , and use of the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) .",

    "the computations presented in this paper were carried out on titan , a cluster owned and maintained by the university of oslo and notur .",
    "in order to compute the two - and - three point functions , we have utilized the method introduced by @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of this method is that given the resolution and the mask of the map , and the desired number of distance bins , the configurations that correspond to an angle @xmath97 is uniquely determined .",
    "one may then do the work of finding these configurations only once , saving them in large tables .",
    "each table then corresponds to a certain bin @xmath9 , and the first row in each table contains all the unmasked pixels of the map .",
    "each column contains all pixels at a distance given by @xmath98 from the pixel in the first element of the column . by moving through a column in such a table ,",
    "one then traces out a circle of radius @xmath98 .",
    "thus , by saving the configurations in tables , one pays the initialization costs only once .",
    "an additional , powerful feature of this approach becomes apparent when computing correlation functions of higher order than 2 .",
    "if one thinks of these tables as compasses , tracing out circles of a given length for each pixel , it should be clear that , just as one can construct , e.g. , triangles using compasses , one can construct triangles on the sphere using these tables . if the edges of the desired triangle is of lengths @xmath97 , @xmath18 and @xmath99 , one begins with the @xmath97 table , selects a pixel from the upper row , and selects a second pixel from the column below this pixel .",
    "one then has the baseline of the triangle . to construct a triangle with a compass when the baseline is given",
    ", one would adjust the compass so that it spans a length equal to the length of the second edge of the triangle , and draw a circle with this radius with one end of the baseline as the center of the circle .",
    "then , one would again adjust the compass so that it spans the desired third length of the triangle , and draw a circle around the other end of the baseline . then",
    ", one would check whether the two circles drawn intercept at any point(s ) .",
    "these points would then be the third vertex of the triangle . carrying this analogy to our tables ,",
    "our two already chosen pixels are the ends of the baseline around which to draw our circles .",
    "we adjust our compass by finding pixel 1 in the first row of table @xmath18 , we draw a circle around it by looping over all pixels in the column below it , and do the same for pixel 2 , expect that we now look in table @xmath99 . by checking whether there are any common pixels in these circles",
    ", we find the triangle(s ) whose edges have the desired lengths .                                                  kamionkowski , m. , kosowsky , a. , & stebbins , a.  1997 , , 55 , 7368 kogut , a. , banday , a.  j. , bennett , c.  l. , hinshaw , g. , lubin , p.  m. , & smoot , g.  f.  1995 , , 439 , l29 kogut , a. , banday , a.  j. , bennett , c.  l. , grski , k.  m. , hinshaw , g. , smoot , g.  f. , & wright , e.  l.  1996 , , 464 , l29"
