    "started to work , the two @xmath1factories open an excited new era in studying @xmath1 meson decays @xcite .",
    "the main research program of these factories is studying cp violation in @xmath1 meson system and investigating their decays . from theoretical point of view",
    ", interest to the rare decays can be attributed to the fact that they occur at loop level in the standard model ( sm ) and they are very sensitive to the flavor structure of the sm as well as to the new physics beyond the sm . from experimental point of view studying radiative",
    "@xmath1 meson decays can provide us essential information on the parameters of the sm , such as the elements of the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , the leptonic decay constants etc .",
    ", which are yet poorly known .",
    "it is well known that the flavor  changing neutral current process @xmath2 has helicity suppression .",
    "these decays are proportional to the lepton mass and because of this reason the decay width of these processes are too small to be measured for the light lepton modes .",
    "it should be noted that in the sm the branching ratio of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "although @xmath5 channel is free of this suppression , its experimental detection is quite hard due to the low efficiency .",
    "it has been observed that the radiative leptonic @xmath6 decays have larger branching ratio compared to that of the purely leptonic models @xcite@xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that similar situation takes place for the radiative decays @xmath7 . in these",
    "decays the contribution of the diagram when photon is radiated from an intermediate charged line , can be neglected , since it is strongly suppressed by a factor @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) part when photon is emitted from external charged leptons is proportional to lepton mass , which follows from helicity arguments , gives small contribution .",
    "for this reason in @xmath9 decay the main contribution should come from the diagrams , when photon is emitted from the initial quarks , i.e. , structure  dependent part ( sd ) , since they are free of the helicity suppression .",
    "therefore the decay rate of the @xmath10 might have an enhancement in comparison to the pure leptonic models of @xmath2 decay if the sd contributions to the decays are dominant and hence @xmath11 decay might be sensitive to the new physics effects beyond sm .",
    "new physics effects in rare @xmath12 decays can appear in two different ways ; either through new contributions to the wilson coefficients existing in the sm or through the new operators in the effective hamiltonian which are absent in the sm .",
    "the goal of this work is combining both these approaches to study the sensitivity of of the physically measurable quantities , like branching ratio , photon energy distribution , to the new physics effects .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section 2 , we derive the general expression for the photon energy distribution using the most general form of four  fermi interaction . in section 3",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of photon energy distribution and branching ratio to the new wilson coefficients .",
    "in this section we calculate the photon energy distribution and branching ratio for the @xmath11 decay using the most general model independent form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the matrix element for the process @xmath9 can be obtained from that of the purely leptonic @xmath13 decay .",
    "the effective @xmath14 transition can be written in terms of twelve model independent four  fermi interactions can be written in the following form @xcite : [ effh ] h_eff & = & v_tqv_tb^\\ { c_sl |q i _ l b |^+ c_br |q i _ r b |^ + & & + c_ll^tot |q_l _ b_l |_l ^_l + c_lr^tot |q_l _ b_l |_r ^_r + c_rl |q_r _ b_r |_l ^_l + & & + c_rr |q_r _ b_r |_r ^_r + c_lrlr |q_l b_r |_l _ r + c_rllr |q_r b_l |_l _",

    "it can easily be seen from eq .",
    "( [ effh ] ) that several of all wilson coefficients do already exist in the sm .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the sm , respectively .",
    "the next four terms in this expression are the vector interactions .",
    "the interaction terms containing @xmath22 and @xmath23 exist in the sm in the form @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "therefore @xmath22 and @xmath23 describe the contributions coming from the sm and the new physics , whose explicit are c_ll^tot & = & c_9^eff - c_10 + c_ll  , + c_lr^tot & = & c_9^eff + c_10 + c_lr  .",

    "it was shown explicitly in the second reference of @xcite that when both processes are considered together , all infrared singularities coming from the real photon emission and the virtual photon corrections are indeed canceled and the final result is finite . in the present work our point of view is slightly different from the standard description , namely , we consider the @xmath32 decay as a different process but not as the @xmath55 correction to the @xmath13 decay .",
    "in other words , we consider the photon in the @xmath11 decay as a hard photon .",

    "( 1 ) we present the dependence of the integrated branching ratio of the @xmath98 decay on the new wilson coefficients for the cut @xmath99 imposed on the photon energy , without long distance effects .",
    "it clearly follows from this figure that as the new wilson coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath29 increase from @xmath101 to @xmath102 branching ratio decreases .",
    "however this behavior is reversed for the coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath27 i.e. , when these coefficients increase from @xmath101 to @xmath102 branching ratio also increases accordingly .",

    "@xmath106 all the previous arguments remain valid with only a slight decrease in the value of the branching ratio .    from all present figures we observe that when all wilson coefficients lie in the range @xmath107 , the branching ratio is more sensitive to the existence of tensor @xmath30 , scalar @xmath108 and vector @xmath109 type interactions .",
    "on the other side , when wilson coefficients lie in the region @xmath110 the branching ratio is more sensitive to the scalar type interaction with coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "photon energy distribution can also give useful information about new physics effects .",
    "for this purpose , in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we present the dependence of the differential branching ratio for the @xmath98 decay on the dimensionless variable @xmath60 at different values of tensor interaction with coefficient @xmath30 .",
    "we observe from this figure that when @xmath111 then the related tensor interaction gives constructive contribution to the sm result , and when @xmath112 the contribution is destructive .",
    "in other words measurement of the differential branching ratio can give essential information about the sign of new wilson coefficients .",
    "performing measurement at different photon energies can give information not only about magnitude but also about the sign of the new wilson coefficient interaction .",
    "note that the results presented in this work can easily be applied to the @xmath113 decay .",
    "for example , the branching ratio for the @xmath113 decay at @xmath99 , without the long distance effects at @xmath114 is larger about 5 times , compared to that of the sm prediction of the branching ratio for the @xmath113 decay .",
    "additionally , the dependence of the branching ratio on the new wilson coefficients is symmetric with respect to the zero point ( see fig .",
    "it should be stressed that by studying the dalitz distribution @xmath115 at different fixed values of the final lepton ( or photon ) energies we can get useful information not only about the magnitude of the new wilson coefficients but also about their sign .    in conclusion , using a general , model independent effective hamiltonian , the @xmath65 decay is studied .",
    "it has been shown that the branching ratio and photon energy distribution are very sensitive to the existence of new physics beyond sm .",
