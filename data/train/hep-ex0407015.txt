    "in the experiment in which they try to detect the neutrino oscillation , by using the size of the earth and measuring the zenith angle distribution of the atmospheric neutrino events , such as , superkamiokande experiment[1 ]  hereafter , simply sk  , it is demanded that the measurements of the direction of the incident neutrino are being carried out as reliably as possible . among the experiments concerned on the neutrino oscillation , the analysis of fully contained events in sk",
    "is regarded as mostly ambiguity - free one , because the essential information to extract clear conclusion is stored inside the detector . in sk , they assume that the direction of the neutrino concerned is the same as that of the produced charged lepton ( hereafter , simply sk assumption)[2,3 ] .",
    "however , the sk assumption does not hold in the just energies concerned for neutrino events produced inside the detector , which is shown later .",

    "in order to examine the influence of the azimuthal angle of the charged leptons over their zenith angle , let us denote the direction cosines of the incident neutrino @xmath12 and denote the scattering angle of the charged lepton , @xmath6 , and the azimuthal angle , @xmath13 , with regard to the axis of the incident neutrino .",

    "from these figures 5 to 10 , it is surely concluded that the zenith angle distributions of the charged leptons under the sk assumption does not reflect the real zenith angle distribution of the incident neutrinos concerned .",
    "of course , it is common sense that the direction of individual charged lepton can not determine that of the neutrino concerned uniquely , but only statistically .",
    "however , our present results clearly shows that the direction of the charged leptons under the sk assumption can not dtermine those of the incident neutrino , even if they accumulate experimental data statistically enough .",
