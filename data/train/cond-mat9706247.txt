    "optical conductivity measurements show that high temperature superconductors exhibit a number of anomalies when compared to the usual drude - like fermi liquid ( fl ) behavior found in conventional metals .",
    "quite generally , experiment shows that the effective transport scattering rate , @xmath0 , exhibits linear in @xmath1 behavior over a wide frequency range , while the measurements of puchkov et al@xcite demonstrate that significant deviations from this standard behavior occur , especially in underdoped materials at low temperatures , in the so called pseudogap regime , where @xmath0 is strongly suppressed .",
    "these anomalies are often attributed to a possible non - fermi liquid ground state in these materials.@xcite    the linear frequency dependence of @xmath2 at relatively high @xmath1 can be regarded as the optical analogue of the anomalous resistivity , @xmath3 , found in the superconducting cuprates , and its presence has been considered as major support for the marginal - fermi liquid ( mfl ) approach.@xcite in the mfl approach , the self energy is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a cutoff frequency and @xmath7 a coupling constant , an expression which explained many of the early experiments.@xcite however , eq .",
    "( [ eq : varma ] ) is inconsistent with recent arpes experiments@xcite on the underdoped materials , which show that both the quasiparticle spectral weight and lifetime are highly anisotropic as one goes around the fermi surface ( fs ) , rather than being momentum independent as eq .",
    "( [ eq : varma ] ) requires .",
    "highly anisotropic quasiparticle behavior finds a natural explanation in the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( nafl ) model of cuprates.@xcite in which the effective interaction between planar quasiparticles is assumed to be proportional to the dynamic spin susceptibility , @xmath8 , measured in nmr and ins experiments . because @xmath8 is strongly peaked in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath9 , quasiparticles on the fs located in the vicinity of the hot spots,@xcite portions of the fs which can be connected by wavevectors @xmath10 , interact strongly , while those located elsewhere ( in _ cold _ regions ) interact comparatively weakly .",
    "nafl theory , with spin - fluctuation parameters and a quasiparticle spectrum taken from experiment , yields results consistent with low frequency nmr and ins experiments , as well as arpes measurements of the fermi surface properties.@xcite we have recently shown that it also provides a consistent qualitative , and in many cases quantitative , explanation of the measured changes with doping and temperature of both the longitudinal and hall conductivities of the cuprates , and shown how one can extract the quite distinct lifetimes of `` hot '' and `` cold '' quasiparticles as a function of temperature directly from these measurements.@xcite in this paper we consider nafl theory at infrared frequencies and show that it explains as well the measured anomalous optical behavior .",

    "in the nafl description of the normal state properties of the superconducting cuprates , it is the magnetic interaction between planar quasiparticles which is responsible for the anomalous spin and charge behavior .",
    "the magnetic properties of the system are specified by the dynamical spin - spin response function of fermionic origin , @xmath12 , which near a peak at a wavevector @xmath13 in the vicinity of @xmath14 , is assumed to take the mean - field form:@xcite @xmath15 hence @xmath16 is the magnitude of the static spin susceptibility at @xmath13 , @xmath17 is the antiferromagnetic correlation length , @xmath18 specifies the low frequency relaxational mode , brought about by the near approach to antiferromagnetism and @xmath19 is a temperature independent scale factor .",
    "we use a system of units in which the lattice spacing @xmath20 .",
    "although experiment suggests that the susceptibility ( [ eq : mmp ] ) quite generally possesses four peaks at the incommensurate wavevectors @xmath21 , since the introduction of the incommensuration does not introduce qualitatively new physics we shall assume for the most part that the spin fluctuation spectrum possesses only a single peak at @xmath14 .",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum is assumed to take a tight - binding form , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the appropriate hopping integrals , while the effective magnetic interaction between the planar quasiparticles is specified by @xmath26 for a given system the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 which determine @xmath28 are taken from fits to nmr and ins ( inelastic neutron scattering ) experiments , while the effective coupling constant , @xmath29 , is assumed to be momentum independent for wavevectors near @xmath13 .",
    "as discussed by chubukov et al,@xcite the effective interaction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) , can be , in principle , derived microscopically starting with , e.g. , a one - band hubbard model .    the effective interaction @xmath30 , eq.([eq : interaction ] ) , has the obvious property that for sufficiently large correlation lengths it is highly peaked for momentum transfers in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath14 .",
    "the consequences of this peaking are hard to overestimate : if the fs of the system of fermions , defined by the quasiparticle dispersion ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) , is such that it intersects the magnetic brillouin zone ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fs ] ) , then quasiparticles in the vicinity of these intersection points on the fs , the hot spots,@xcite are much more strongly scattered by the spin - fluctuations than those which are on other parts ( cold regions ) of the fs .",
    "this leads to strongly anisotropic quasiparticle behavior , since the resulting temperature and frequency variation of the quasiparticle scattering rates at and far away from hot spots is in general very different .",
    "we shall return to this point in the following section .",
    "barzykin and pines ( bp ) have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmp ] ) to analyse nmr results in the cuprates.@xcite they find that for underdoped systems the low frequency magnetic behavior possesses three distinct normal state phases , and that the characteristic frequencies and lengths which enter eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmp ] ) are connected by a dynamic scaling relationship , @xmath31 , in two of the phases .",
    "thus , above the temperature , @xmath32 , at which the temperature dependent uniform susceptibility , @xmath33 , possesses a maximum , the system exhibits non - universal mean field ( mf ) behavior with dynamical exponent @xmath34 ; @xmath35 , and the product , @xmath36 is independent of temperature . from a detailed analysis of the nmr experiments , barzykin and pines conclude that the crossover temperature , @xmath32 , is determined by the strength of the af correlations , with @xmath37 . below @xmath32 , down to a second crossover temperature , @xmath38 , underdoped systems exhibit non - universal , @xmath39 , pseudoscaling ( ps ) behavior .",
    "thus for @xmath40 , it is @xmath41 which is independent of temperature .",
    "nmr experiments show that above @xmath32 , in the mf regime , @xmath18 and @xmath42 scale linearly with @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath43 , while in the ps regime , between @xmath38 and @xmath32 , it is @xmath18 and @xmath44 which scale linearly with @xmath11 , albeit with a possibly somewhat different slope and intercept of @xmath18 than that found above @xmath32 .",
    "this behavior has now been verified experimentally for the yba@xmath45cu@xmath46o@xmath47 , la@xmath48sr@xmath49cuo@xmath50 and yba@xmath45cu@xmath50o@xmath51 systems,@xcite as well as the hg and 2212 bscco compounds.@xcite below @xmath38 , in the pseudogap ( pg ) regime , @xmath17 becomes independent of temperature while @xmath18 , after exhibiting a minimum near @xmath38 , rapidly increases ( roughly as @xmath52 ) as @xmath11 decreases toward @xmath53 .",
    "these changes in the magnetic fluctuation spectrum are accompanied by ( indeed result from ) changes in the quasiparticle spectrum.@xcite thus , the ps regime is characterized by a strong temperature variation of the quasiparticle spectrum , resulting in a fs evolution@xcite which has non - trivial consequences for the transport properties of underdoped systems.@xcite the crossovers seen in the low frequency magnetic behavior thus possess , to a considerable extent , their charge counterparts in transport experiments .    from a magnetic perspective , the so called optimally doped systems ( e.g. , yba@xmath45cu@xmath46o@xmath54 and la@xmath55sr@xmath56cuo@xmath50 ) are a special case of the underdoped systems , in which @xmath38 is comparatively close to @xmath53 .",
    "overdoped cuprates are defined as those for which @xmath57 . for these systems , then , the antiferromagnetic correlations are comparatively weak , with @xmath58 , @xmath33 is at most weakly temperature dependent , while @xmath59 follows the linear in @xmath11 behavior found in the underdoped systems above @xmath32 .",
    "examples of overdoped systems are the @xmath60k tl 2212 system and la@xmath48sr@xmath49cuo@xmath50 for @xmath61 .    as monthoux and pines,@xcite and chubukov et al@xcite have emphasized , the physical origin of the highly anomalous behavior displayed by the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquids resides in the non - linear feedback of changes in the _ hot _ quasiparticle spectrum on the strong quasiparticle interaction , @xmath62 , which determines that _ hot _ quasiparticle behavior . for systems above @xmath32 , or in overdoped systems , that feedback is negative ; strong coupling effects cause @xmath33 to increase weakly as the temperature decreases , while an rpa or mean field description description suffices to determine the relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath17 . at a critical value of the strength of the af correlations , that feedback becomes positive ; a weak pseudogap develops in the hot quasiparticle spectrum , bringing about a linear decrease in @xmath33 as @xmath11 decreases below @xmath32 , while the quasiparticle damping of spin excitations becomes @xmath11 dependent in such a way that @xmath18 displays @xmath39 pseudoscaling behavior , with the strength of the af correlations , @xmath17 , growing as @xmath63 .",
    "the second crossover temperature , @xmath38 , marks the transition to `` strong '' pseudogap behavior : the af correlations become frozen ; @xmath18 increases rapidly as @xmath11 decreases below @xmath38 , while @xmath33 falls off rapidly between @xmath38 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is the interplay between these changes in the quasiparticle spectrum ( seen directly in arpes measurements ) and the spin fluctuation spectrum , and effective quasiparticle interaction , seen directly in nmr and ins experiments , which is responsible for the anomalous quasiparticle lifetimes we now consider .",
    "we begin by estimating the effective scattering rate , for quasiparticles near the fs , as a function of frequency and temperature using simple perturbation theory .",
    "the quasiparticle lifetime is determined by the imaginary part of the single particle self - energy , which , for the effective interaction ( [ eq : interaction ] ) , in the second order born approximation , reads : @xmath64\\label{eq : scatkq}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are the bose and fermi distribution functions respectively . the transport relaxation rate is usually given by : @xmath68 ( 1-\\gamma_{k , k^\\prime})\\label{eq : tau_vertex}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a temperature independent vertex function which removes forward scattering processes from the calculated transport relaxation rate . as we shall see below , for overdoped , optimally doped , and even underdoped systems above @xmath38 , the dominant contribution to @xmath70 comes from large momentum transfer scattering processes and hence the use of @xmath69 for forward scattering corrections plays only a minor role .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath71 , and return later to the role of the vertex corrections at low temperatures in underdoped systems .",
    "we make the usual change of variables in the integral in eq.([eq : tau_vertex ] ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the component of momentum @xmath74 parallel to the equipotential lines ( @xmath75 ) , and carry out the integration over @xmath76 for @xmath77 near the fs and @xmath78 , where @xmath23 is the hopping matrix element . on making the substitution @xmath79 in eq .",

    "obviously , the integral @xmath83 is hard to solve analytically .",

    "a generalization of the relaxation time approximation , the memory function formalism,@xcite is appropriate for a self energy which , in the vicinity of the fs , does not depend on momentum , as is the case when the dominant scattering mechanism is due to phonons , as in ordinary metallic superconductors ; at sufficiently high frequency , it leads to a drude - like conductivity : @xmath198 with a frequency dependent effective scattering rate , and a frequency dependent mass @xmath199 , @xmath200 .",
    "this expression is not directly applicable for the case of highly anisotropic scattering rates such as those studied here .",
    "however , we show below that in nafls , at sufficiently high frequencies , one can obtain an expression of this form , in which @xmath179 represents an average scattering rate as a function both of momentum and frequency .",
    "we proceed in the following way : we first recall that in the nafl model the imaginary part of the self energy depends only weakly on the component of the wavevector @xmath110 perpendicular to the fs ; the dominant momentum dependence comes from the component which lies in a direction parallel to the fs ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_e_k ] ) and the discussion which follows ) .",
    "this is clearly an approximation , but not an unreasonable one , since only quasiparticles in a narrow region ( of order @xmath11 ) around the fs are involved in the scattering ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : resigmaxx ] ) ) . in this case",
    "one can perform the change of variables ( [ eq : varchange ] ) and integrate over @xmath201 explicitly .",
    "if the integral can be extended to infinity , the result can be expressed in the quite compact form : @xmath202 in the limit @xmath203 we can expand this expression and compare our result to the drude - formula in the same limit .",
    "we find : @xmath204 in the limit @xmath205 this yields @xmath206 where the brackets indicate the appropriate average .",
    "we have already obtained the momentum averaged scattering rate , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_approx ] ) , which , at high frequencies , took the mfl form , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nafl_mfl ] ) .",
    "these expressions show that the average ( over momentum ) of @xmath70 is a simple power law as a function of frequency , being quadratic and linear at low and high @xmath1 respectively . as a result ,",
    "averaging over frequency will not qualitatively change the frequency dependence of the momentum averaged scattering rate , @xmath207 , since an average of a power - law function is that same function .",
    "therefore , aside from numerical factors ( of order 2 ) and a somewhat different crossover scale @xmath150 , the momentum averaged scattering rate @xmath207 is a reasonable approximation for @xmath175 in the limit , @xmath208 .",
    "several important conclusions can be drawn from this result .",
    "first , only at high frequencies should the drude formalism be used to analyze experiments .",
    "but , since at sufficiently high frequencies , in general , the quasiparticle picture breaks down , the results we obtain are likely only qualitative .",
    "one can show that drude - like behavior is maintained as one goes to lower frequencies , but the corresponding scattering rate is no longer simply related to the quasiparticle self - energy , and will not be frequency independent .",
    "moreover , quite importantly , in the limit @xmath209 any feature seen in experiments , such as the weak temperature dependence of @xmath175 at higher @xmath11 and @xmath1 , or even the pseudogap seen in underdoped materials , must stem from the quasiparticle lifetimes analyzed in the previous section , since it is their average which is probed .",
    "we now compare our results with experiment , in order to test the applicability of nafl theory when one uses realistic parameters for both the effective interaction and band parameters and carries out the relevant integrals numerically . since the optical conductivity as a function of frequency frequently appears featureless , it is customary to use the memory function formalism@xcite to extract the effective transport scattering rates from experiments .",
    "where this has been done , the analysis of the previous section allows us to compare directly our ( averaged ) scattering times with experiment .    for systems for which the scattering rates have not been determined",
    "we compare our calculated values of @xmath185 directly to experiment . in so doing , we make use of our numerical results for the optical conductivity obtained by substituting the self energy ( [ eq : scatkq ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : resigmaxx ] ) , with and without including the inclusion of the vertex @xmath210 for @xmath70 where @xmath211 is the angle between @xmath110 and @xmath73 . strictly speaking",
    ", this form of the vertex correction is only applicable if the effective interaction is weakly frequency dependent , since only then is the current vertex proportional to the current , and hence additive to the self - energy . in nafls",
    "this is a somewhat questionable approximation , but as long as @xmath212 , while @xmath30 is highly peaked near @xmath213 and the fs is large , the magnitude of the vertex correction turns out to be comparatively small , leading to corrections of order 10% for systems near optimal doping .",
    "however , since it is straightforward to include it numerically , we retain the function @xmath69 in the subsequent numerical results .",
    "we begin with overdoped materials . while it is extremely important to compare the calculated optical conductivity with experiment only for the samples which are used to determine the spin fluctuation parameters , nmr and optical experimental results on the same sample are often not available .",
    "thus for the first sample we consider , single layer tl 2201 , the samples used by puchkov et al,@xcite for optical experiments had a @xmath214k , while the best available nmr experiments on a comparable sample are those of itoh et al,@xcite on a tl 2201 sample which had a @xmath215k . for overdoped systems , the various parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 ) which determine the spin fluctuation spectrum do not vary appreciately with the doping level ; hence our use of parameters chosen to fit the nmr experiments of itoh et al should not produce an appreciable error . in choosing band structure parameters for our calculation , we assumed the band structure for the tl system is close to that found in bscco family .",
    "our calculated results , are compared with experiment in fig .",
    "[ fig : tl_tau ] .",
    "we present our results only for @xmath216k , since for @xmath217k the stability of our numerical solution becomes questionable . clearly the fit is quite good ; both theory and experiment show that the system crosses over from the quadratic to linear in frequency behavior at a frequency @xmath149 , which is of order @xmath218mev .",
    "note that the crossover behavior changes very little with temperature , as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_approx ] ) for the case of the @xmath34 scaling present in all ( sufficiently ) overdoped materials .",
    "we further note that only two fitting parameters appear in our calculation : the coupling constant , @xmath29 , and the zero frequency offset ( which is very small , @xmath219 @xmath220 and is likely generated by impurities ) . if the resistivity were measured for this material both fitting parameters would be fixed by experiment .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gins ] we compare our calculated optical conductivity for optimally doped yba@xmath45cu@xmath46o@xmath167 with the experimental results of ref .  .",
    "we have assumed , as in previous work , that @xmath221$]mev , @xmath169mev . strictly speaking this scaling law , applicable only for temperatures above @xmath222k ,",
    "is only approximately correct at lower temperatures . at high temperature",
    "our calculated results agree quite well with the experiment , both qualitatively and quantitatively . at low @xmath11 qualitative agreement",
    "is found ; the calculated @xmath185 at @xmath223k crosses the calculated @xmath185 at @xmath224k at roughly the same frequency as that seen experimentally , although at high @xmath1 the calculated values of @xmath196 are considerably lower than those seen experimentally .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy , in part , to the possible presence of disorder in the experimental samples : for example , we found it necessary to use a higher value of the coupling constant @xmath29 ( @xmath225ev ) than that used in ref .",
    "( @xmath226ev ) to fit the resistivity . a small amount of , e.g.",
    ", impurity scattering can bring about significant changes in transport and optical behavior at relatively low temperatures , while producing a negligible effect at higher @xmath11 .",
    "an interesting feature of the yba@xmath45c@xmath49o@xmath227 family is the a - b plane anisotropy , which is seen in untwinned single crystals near optimal doping .",
    "[ we have earlier provided a qualitative explanation for the anisotropy in the resistivity of these materials@xcite and it is instructive to consider its optical counterpart . ] in fig .  [ fig:1248 ]",
    "we show the optical conductivity for a model system which displays strong @xmath228 planar anisotropy , comparable to that observed in yba@xmath45cu@xmath50o@xmath51 .",
    "we follow ref .   and assume that the main influence of the cuo chains is to modify the electronic properties of the a - b plane and so model the observed anisotropy by introducing anisotropic hopping matrix elements along the two different crystallographic directions , with @xmath229 .",
    "this value of @xmath230 is somewhat low , but is not unreasonable for a qualitative analysis for pedagogical purposes .",
    "the input parameters ( @xmath231 $ ] mev and @xmath232 mev ) are the same as in our earlier work.@xcite as can be seen from the figure , the strong anisotropy we found for the d.c .",
    "resistivity has its analog in the case of @xmath185 , as might have been expected ; the strongly conducting @xmath233 direction displays a distinctly different @xmath1 dependence at higher frequencies .",
    "this behavior can be understood by recalling that when the current runs along the @xmath233 direction , the distribution of hot spots is such as to yield scattering rates which are mostly fl like , and hence one should expect to see a large conductivity even at large @xmath1 . on the other hand , for current running along the @xmath234 direction the dominant contribution to the conductivity comes from quasiparticles which possess strongly anomalous scattering rates ; this leads to a much stronger frequency dependence of @xmath235 , of the kind observed in many underdoped samples .",
    "we consider next the underdoped materials . above @xmath38",
    ", we expect the behavior of @xmath179 to take the mfl form , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nafl_mfl ] ) .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ eq : nafl_mfl ] ) , obtained for a moderately large fs , does not depend on the spin fluctuation parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath17 , and hence independent of the scaling law relating @xmath18 and @xmath17 ; @xmath179 is linear in both @xmath11 and @xmath1 both above and below @xmath32 , as long as @xmath236 . on the other hand , it is now widely believed that in heavily underdoped materials , below @xmath38 , the hot quasiparticles , which are close to the magnetic bz boundary become effectively gapped ( the pseudogap ) , with much of the quasiparticle weight transferred from low to high frequencies ; the quasiparticle band dispersion thus acquires a form similar to that encountered with a preformed spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state.@xcite hence , at low frequencies , hot quasiparticles barely contribute to transport , a conclusion which is consistent with the superfluid density measurements at low temperatures , which suggest that only a fraction of the doped holes become part of the superconducting condensate.@xcite although quasiparticles are not well defined in the hot region of the bz , since their quasiparticle residua are rather small , they still contribute to transport up to frequencies of order @xmath38 . above this scale their scattering is so strong that @xmath237 is essentially temperature and frequency independent ( see the result for @xmath163 in fig .  [ fig : scatt1 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the cold quasiparticles are still well defined , albeit in a somewhat narrower region , centered around @xmath238 , and symmetry related points in the brillouin zone .",
    "however , since so much of the fs is gapped , the phase space available for the scattering of cold quasiparticles is considerably reduced .",
    "thus for small frequency , @xmath239 , one expects @xmath240 , just as one finds @xmath241 at zero frequency and temperatures well below @xmath38 in underdoped materials .",
    "in other words , there is a significant temperature variation of @xmath179 up to this frequency .",
    "as the hot quasiparticles cease to contribute to transport above this energy scale , which is valid as long as the correlation length is large ( that is , for @xmath242 , and @xmath243 ) , the slope of @xmath179 is reduced and it acquires its usual linear in @xmath1 dependence . in terms of the nafl model , a close study shows that the effective rate @xmath175 increases up to frequencies of order @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is much smaller ( @xmath246 - 0.5 ) than is found in optimally doped materials .",
    "this phenomenon is the optical analog of the resistivity which is a considerably stronger function of temperature below @xmath38 than above it .",
    "it is noteworthy that at sufficiently high temperature , above @xmath32 , much of the quasiparticle weight is again transferred to the low frequencies and the hot quasiparticle again start to contribute to transport , but the slope of @xmath179 does not change , since it does not depend on the scaling law between the spin fluctuation parameters .",
    "we note that the fact that the contribution of the hot regions is strongly reflected in experiment in the underdoped materials suggests that large parts of the fs are in fact hot .",
    "moreover , at higher frequency and low temperatures the slope of @xmath179 is the same as that found at high @xmath11 in systems where there is no pseudogap present . if large parts of the fs exhibit highly anomalous behavior , then one should expect that at relatively low frequencies @xmath179 would begin to saturate .",
    "indeed , we have found that the mfl form of @xmath179 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nafl_mfl ] ) , is obtained only for a large fs , while for a smaller fs one would expect @xmath179 to display sublinear behavior as a function of frequency .",
    "this suggests that the linear in @xmath1 behavior of @xmath179 above @xmath38 reflects scattering processes involving momentum transfers far from @xmath14 , which supplement the magnetic scattering we have considered . if one is to maintain the linear behavior of @xmath179 for @xmath247 and @xmath1 larger than @xmath165 , the dominant scattering mechanism must crossover from processes involving small to those involving larger characteristic frequencies .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "we introduced fl scattering in order to avoid resistivity saturation at higher temperatures in 214 systems and obtained thereby quite reasonable agreement with experiment near optimal doping level . in this respect ,",
    "optimally doped materials are merely those which have the smoothest transition from low energy to high energy scales , in excellent agreement with the experimental findings of takagi et al.@xcite    the additional scattering processes introduced to maintain linear in frequency @xmath179 above the pseudogap scale , do not qualitatively change the behavior of the effective relaxation rate at low frequencies which is still governed by the strong magnetic scattering .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau_fl ] the result of a numerical calculation of @xmath179 , where we have used @xmath248 , taken @xmath18 and @xmath17 to be the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : hot_cold_z1]a , and have incorporated in our numerical work , based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigmamunu ] ) and ( [ eq : resigmaxx ] ) , a fl - like scattering potential , @xmath249 , where @xmath250 mev , .",
    "notice that @xmath179 loses its temperature dependence at high frequency , i.e. , all curves shown in the figure converge at a frequency @xmath251 . below this frequency @xmath179",
    "displays considerable temperature dependence , even though we have not included the increase of @xmath18 at low temperatures and a possible temperature variation in the effective size of the fs . within the magnetic scenario ,",
    "these scattering processes are closely related to the experimentally measured energy scales for @xmath252 . moreover , since the scale of @xmath165 is weakly doping dependent and always of the order of @xmath253 times the fermi energy the crossover energy should be almost material independent , in agreement with nmr experiments which show that for most materials @xmath37 .",
    "in summary , we have applied both analytical and numerical techniques to the study of the transport properties of htss at optical frequencies within the nafl model .",
    "we find that the peaking of the effective magnetic interaction leads to strong anisotropy of the quasiparticle properties in different regions of the bz , and brings about a complex morphology for the optical conductivity and the effective scattering rate , @xmath175 , which can be extracted from it .",
    "we found that for a wide region of temperature and frequencies the nafl model leads directly to the mfl form for @xmath179 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nafl_mfl ] ) , a scattering rate which agrees with experimental results found in nearly all optical measurements to date .",
    "overall , in the appropriate limits , our results agree qualitatively and many cases quantitatively , with the experimental findings .    in this paper",
    "we have focused on the optimally doped and overdoped materials . in the underdoped case , to obtain results of comparable quality , one must parametrize in some detail changes in the quasiparticle behavior brought about by the quasiparticle pseudogap , which we have not yet done .",
    "however , to the extent that the fs undergoes a substantial transition as one varies doping from optimal to underdoped we have shown that the magnetic scenario provides results in qualitative agreement with experiment , even within this simple theory .    our use of the born approximation , would seem to work somewhat better than one would expect it to in a system with strong correlations .",
    "ideally , one should obtain @xmath192 self - consistently , before substituting it into eq .",
