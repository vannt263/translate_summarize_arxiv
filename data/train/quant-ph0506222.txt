    "continuous - variable wigner functions @xmath1 have been used for a long time to represent quantum systems in phase space @xcite .",
    "the wigner function @xmath1 is an alternative complete description of quantum states which behaves almost like a phase - space probability density .",
    "not only is it real - valued and normalized but it also yields the correct value of the probability density for the quadrature @xmath2 when integrated along the phase - space line @xmath3 .",
    "however , unlike probability densities , the wigner function can assume negative values for some quantum states .",
    "this negativity of the wigner function has been considered a defining signature of non  classicality ( or quantum coherence and interference ) @xcite .    in quantum information science",
    "we usually deal with systems with a space of states with a finite dimension @xmath4 .",
    "for example , for a system of @xmath5 qubits the dimension of the ( hilbert ) space of states is @xmath6 . for such systems , various discrete analogues of the wigner function",
    "have been proposed @xcite and used to investigate a variety of interesting problems connected with quantum computation such as the phase - space representation of quantum algorithms @xcite , separability @xcite , quantum state tomography @xcite , teleportation @xcite , decoherence in quantum walks @xcite , and error correction @xcite .",
    "here we shall concentrate on a class of discrete wigner functions @xmath0 introduced recently by gibbons _",
    "this elegant approach seems to be a potentially powerful tool to establish connections between phase - space techniques and problems in quantum information and foundations of quantum mechanics .    in this paper",
    "we study the set of states with non - negative discrete wigner functions @xmath0 for all functions in the class proposed by @xcite , and the group of unitaries that preserve non - negativity of @xmath0 .",
    "our first result is a complete characterization of the set of quantum states having non - negative discrete wigner functions @xmath0 .",
    "this is done by proving a conjecture presented by one of us in @xcite ( a related discussion in a somewhat different context , using concepts in high - dimensional geometry appeared in @xcite ) .",
    "our proof is elementary and constructive , and shows that the only pure states with non - negative @xmath0 are stabilizer states , i.e. simultaneous eigenstates of generalized pauli operators @xcite .",
    "we then study the group of unitaries which preserve non - negativity of @xmath0 , and prove that they form a subgroup of the clifford group .",
    "this means such states and unitaries are classical in the sense of allowing for an efficient classical simulation scheme using the stabilizer formalism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the discrete wigner functions @xmath0 of @xcite . in section iii",
    "we characterize the states with non - negative @xmath0 , in section iv we discuss positivity - preserving unitary dynamics in phase space and in section v we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we review the class of discrete wigner functions proposed in @xcite and discuss some of their features .",
    "let us assume that we are describing a quantum state whose hilbert space dimensionality @xmath4 is a power of a prime number @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . in such cases one can introduce a phase - space grid with @xmath9 points and label the position and momentum coordinates @xmath10 with elements of the finite galois field @xmath11 @xcite . at first the use of elements of @xmath11 for both phase - space coordinates",
    "could be seen as an unnecessary complication , but it turns out to be an essential step .",
    "the reason is that by doing this we can endow the phase - space grid with the same geometric properties as the ordinary plane .",
    "for example , in the finite @xmath9 grid we can define lines as solutions to linear equations of the form @xmath12 [ where all elements and operations in this equation are in @xmath11 ] .",
    "each line will then consist of exactly @xmath4 points of the grid .",
    "the field structure of @xmath11 ensures the validity of properties such as : ( i ) there is only one line joining any given two points , ( ii ) two lines are either parallel ( i.e. with no points in common ) or they intersect at a single point .",
    "moreover , it is possible to show that a set of @xmath4 parallel lines ( which we will call a _ _",
    "striation__@xcite ) is obtained by varying the parameter @xmath14 in the equation @xmath12 .",
    "finally , the number of different striations turns out to be @xmath15 .",
    "the complete set of @xmath15 striations has been studied for a long time in discrete geometry , where it is called a finite affine plane @xcite .",
    "we will label the striations with an index @xmath16 and the lines within a striation with an index @xmath17 . in this way the @xmath18-th line belonging to the @xmath19th striation will be denoted as @xmath20 .",
    "a discrete phase space with the above properties was used by gibbons , hoffman and wootters in @xcite to define a class of discrete wigner functions . as mentioned above ,",
    "the crucial property of the continuous wigner function is that its integral along any line @xmath21 is equal to the expectation value of a projection operator @xmath22 , i.e. a probability .",
    "this essential feature is generalized to the discrete case in a straightforward way : every line in the @xmath9 phase - space grid is associated to a rank one projection operator . as noted in @xcite , this association can not be arbitrary and must obey some simple geometric constraints . for example , we can define a set of @xmath9 unitary operators @xmath23 acting on the hilbert space that faithfully represent discrete phase - space translations . for the association between lines and states to respect covariance under translations",
    "we must impose that the quantum state associated to a translated line should be identical to the state obtained by acting with the operator @xmath23 on the original state .",
    "this covariance constraint can be used to show the validity of some very significant properties : a ) the states associated to parallel lines must be orthogonal ; b ) the overlap between states associated to non - parallel lines must be equal to @xmath24 .",
    "this is important and implies that the @xmath15 phase - space striations must be associated to an equal number of mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) , i.e. bases @xmath25 such that @xmath26    as we see , mutually unbiased bases are orthonormal bases picked in such a way that any state in one basis is an equal  amplitude superposition of all the states of any other basis .",
    "a complete set of @xmath15 mub is known to exist if the dimensionality of the space of states is a power of a prime number . in such case , many constructions of mub have been proposed @xcite . it has been shown that a complete set of @xmath15 mub for @xmath4-dimensional systems can be chosen to consist solely of stabilizer states , i.e. simultaneous eigenstates of sets of ( generalized ) pauli operators @xcite .    the defining feature of the discrete wigner functions of @xcite is the association between mub and striations in the discrete phase space . as discussed in @xcite",
    "this can be done in a variety of ways and each defines a different _ quantum net _",
    "@xcite , which will result in a different definition of the discrete wigner function @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we propose a notion of classicality of quantum states which is based on non - negativity of @xmath0 for _ all _ quantum nets obtainable from a fixed complete set of mub .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there have been proposals of criteria to narrow down the choice of quantum nets : in @xcite the criterion is covariance under the so - called discrete squeezing operator ; and in @xcite the net is chosen so as to enforce a natural relation between a separable state s @xmath0 and the @xmath0 of its subsystems .",
    "the quantum net is defined by associating each line @xmath20 in striation @xmath19 to a projector @xmath27 onto a basis state of basis @xmath19 .",
    "having fixed a quantum net , the discrete wigner function is uniquely defined by imposing the condition that the sum of its values along any line should be equal to the expectation value of the projector corresponding to that line ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the resulting wigner function at any phase - space point @xmath28 can then be shown to be @xmath29 where the sum is over projectors associated with all lines @xmath20 containing point @xmath30 .",
    "the construction of the striations guarantees that the sum above will contain exactly one projector from each basis .",
    "the operators @xmath31 are known as _ phase - space point operators _ and form a complete basis for the space of operators , which is orthogonal in the schmidt inner product ( i.e. @xmath32 ) .",
    "we can rewrite the expression for the wigner function at phase - space point @xmath30 using the probabilities associated with the projectors @xmath33 : @xmath34 in terms of these probabilities , the wigner function at the point @xmath30 takes the form @xmath35    the discrete wigner function @xmath0 can be shown to have many of the features of the continuous wigner function @xmath1 @xcite : it is real ( but can be negative ) , normalized , and its values are obtained through eq .",
    "( [ eqwprob ] ) from measurements onto mub . here",
    "the mub projectors play the role that the quadratures @xmath36 play in @xmath1 , forming a particularly symmetric set of observables whose measurement results completely characterize the state ( in a process known as _ quantum tomography _ ) . for",
    "a discussion of further properties of @xmath0 see @xcite .    in the discussion that follows we will often be representing quantum states using the probabilities @xmath37 .",
    "as the projectors @xmath33 form an over  complete basis for the space of density matrices , these probabilities completely characterize the state . since for any striation @xmath38 , there are only @xmath39 independent probabilities for each basis , resulting in a total of @xmath40 independent probabilities , exactly the number of real parameters necessary to describe a general normalized mixed quantum state in @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space",
    ". each quantum state is represented by a point @xmath41 in this @xmath42-dimensional probability space .    as mentioned above , for power - of - prime @xmath4",
    "it is possible to build a complete set of @xmath15 mub using only stabilizer states , i.e. joint eigenstates of generalized pauli operators .",
    "let us discuss more explicitly such constructions for the case @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath5 qubits ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in order to define a complete set of @xmath43 mub we start by partitioning the @xmath44 pauli operators ( excluding the identity ) into @xmath43 sets @xmath45 of @xmath46 pauli operators each .",
    "we will require that the pauli operators in each set @xmath45 be mutually commuting , but otherwise the partitioning can be completely arbitrary . if we add the identity and a @xmath47 phase to the pauli operators in each set @xmath45 , each will form a maximal abelian subgroup of the pauli group .",
    "the joint eigenstates of each such set @xmath45 form a basis for the hilbert space , and due to properties of the pauli operators the @xmath43 bases thus defined can be shown to be mutually unbiased @xcite .",
    "the phase - space construction provides a natural procedure for partitioning the pauli group into disjoint , mutually commuting sets .",
    "the idea , which is worth reviewing here , was described in @xcite and further elaborated in @xcite .",
    "pauli operators represent phase - space translations and can be labelled using binary @xmath5tuples @xmath41 and @xmath48 ( @xmath5tuples @xmath48 and @xmath41 contain the coordinates of the field elements @xmath49 and @xmath7 in a given basis as described below ) .",
    "each pauli operator can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 stand for the pauli operators on qubit @xmath53 , and the phase is chosen so as to make the operators hermitian .",
    "the definition above will be written in shorthand as @xmath54 the condition for two pauli operators to commute turns out to be @xmath55=0 \\text { iff } \\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{p^\\prime}-\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{q^\\prime}=0 \\quad ( { \\rm mod } ~2 ) .",
    "\\label{eqcomrel}\\ ] ]    let us consider a set of @xmath39 pauli operators @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an arbitrary binary matrix , @xmath58 is its transpose and @xmath59 , @xmath60 are binary @xmath5tuples .",
    "any two operators of this set commute .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath61 forms a maximal abelian subgroup of the pauli group if and only if @xmath57 is a generating element of the matrix representation of the field @xmath62 .",
    "this can be seen as follows : the product of two elements of @xmath61 is itself an element of this set ( up to a sign ) iff the matrix @xmath57 is such that for every pair of integers @xmath63 , there is a third integer @xmath64 such that @xmath65 [ where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , for the set to have exactly @xmath39 different elements , the matrix @xmath57 should be such that all powers @xmath68 for @xmath69 are nonzero and different from each other . for @xmath57 satisfying these conditions",
    ", it can be seen that @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the elements of the set @xmath71 form a finite field , and we see that the matrix @xmath57 and its powers form a matrix representation of @xmath62 .",
    "a possible choice for @xmath57 , used in @xcite , is the so  called `` companion matrix '' of the primitive polynomial which defines the product rule in the field .",
    "with such a matrix we can build @xmath15 disjoint sets of commuting paulis of the form @xmath61 by choosing the binary @xmath5tuples @xmath72 as explained below .",
    "the association between each phase - space point @xmath10 and a pauli operator @xmath73 must respect the covariance of the construction under phase space translations .",
    "this is done as follows : the line formed by all phase - space points satisfying the equation @xmath74 is invariant under phase - space translations of the form @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is a generating element of the field ) .",
    "to this phase - space translation we must associate an operator acting in hilbert space .",
    "the natural identification is to associate this with the operator @xmath78 . here , the choice of @xmath5tuples @xmath79 and @xmath80 is arbitrary .",
    "the important point is that once this choice is made [ i.e. , once we arbitrarily assign two @xmath5tuples to the point @xmath81 we repeatedly apply the matrix @xmath57 ( @xmath82 ) to the position ( momentum ) coordinates to obtain the @xmath5tuples parametrizing the pauli operators associated to the other phase - space points @xcite . in summary , this construction associates an operator @xmath73 to every phase space point @xmath10 in such a way that the elements of the abelian subgroup @xmath61 are associated to points in phase space that belong to the _ ray _ defined by the equation @xmath83 ( a _ ray _ is defined as a line that contains the origin ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that by varying the @xmath5tuples @xmath84 one can construct only @xmath15 different sets @xmath85 .",
    "if we define the two @xmath5tuples @xmath86 and @xmath87 , these maximal mutually commuting sets of pauli operators can be conveniently built by choosing @xmath88 ( which we will associate with the horizontal striation ) , @xmath89 ( the vertical striation ) and @xmath90 for @xmath91 ( the other striations ) .",
    "thus , the mapping between striations and mub is naturally determined by the phase - space construction , as lines which are invariant under the transformations @xmath75 , @xmath76 must be associated to states which are invariant under the corresponding transformations in hilbert space , that is , the translation operators in @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the lines of the form @xmath74 must be associated to common eigenstates of the set @xmath61 .",
    "however , there is no criterion telling us how to associate each line in a striation with a projector in the corresponding basis . we can count the number of possible quantum nets as follows : for the ray of a given striation there are @xmath4 possible projectors to choose from ;",
    "once this choice has been made the condition of covariance under translations determines which projector should be associated to each of the other lines in the same striation .",
    "as there are @xmath15 rays , the number of possible associations between lines and projectors is @xmath92 , each of which defines a different quantum net , leading to a different definition of the wigner function .",
    "the projectors associated to each of the lines in the vertical and horizontal striations can be chosen in such a way that the coordinates of each line correspond to the eigenvalues of the paulis generating the set ( the single qubit paulis @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively )",
    ". then , there are still @xmath95 possible quantum nets , each of them given by a particular choice of projectors to be associated to the rays of the remaining _ oblique _ striations .",
    "there is a closely related methodology for constructing the wigner functions for general dimension @xmath96 which emphasizes the link between the exponents of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 operators and the finite geometry of @xmath97 $ ] , the two - dimensional vector space over the field @xmath11 .",
    "one defines lines , rays and striations in this two dimensional space and then , using the properties of the algebraic field extension , defines an isomorphism with @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "vectors in this second space serve as exponents of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 operators , and the commuting classes of generalized pauli matrices correspond precisely to parallel lines in a striation in the first vector space .",
    "details of this approach and a methodology for assigning projections to lines are given in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , let us now characterize the set of states having non - negative discrete wigner functions @xmath0 simultaneously in all definitions proposed by gibbons _",
    "@xcite for power - of - prime dimension @xmath4",

    "the set @xmath99 is specified as the intersection of a number of half - spaces in the @xmath42-dimensional @xmath41-space . from ( [ eqwprob ] )",
    "it can be seen that each half - space inequality is of the form @xmath100 where the probabilities appearing in the sum are associated with the lines containing phase - space point @xmath30 , and hence depend on @xmath30 and on the quantum net chosen .",
    "the intersection of the half - spaces defined by these inequalities is a convex polytope in @xmath41-space , given in an h - description ( h standing for `` half - space '' ) .",
    "any convex polytope also admits an alternative v - description ( v for `` vertices '' ) , consisting of the list of vertices whose convex hull defines the polytope .",
    "galvo showed that for @xmath101 , the h - polytope @xmath99 has a v - description whose vertices are the mub projectors @xcite , and conjectured this would also be true for general power - of - prime @xmath4 . a geometrical argument showing the validity of this conjecture",
    "was given in @xcite .",

    "there is some wigner function definition which , at some point @xmath30 , evaluates to a minimum value among all definitions and all points @xmath30 .",

    "so it is enough to show @xmath151 is clifford ( done in theorem [ thm : auxxz ] ) , which is easier as by construction @xmath151 are unitaries that preserve both the @xmath147 basis and the @xmath149 basis .    with this more general result in hand",
    ", we can consider the case when the two partitions are one and the same ( @xmath152 ) , and we will have what we wanted to prove , i.e. that our ` classical ' unitaries @xmath135 are clifford group operators .",
    "we wish to show    let @xmath142 be a unitary transformation that maps a complete set of pauli mub @xmath140 to a second complete set of pauli mub @xmath141 .",
    "then @xmath142 is in the clifford group , up to a global phase .",
    "[ thm : mubequiv ]    the first step involves proving the following lemma :    let @xmath153 and @xmath154 be two maximal abelian subgroups of the pauli group , with @xmath155 .",
    "then there exists a clifford operation which maps @xmath156 , @xmath157 .",
    "* proof : *    since @xmath153 and @xmath154 are maximal abelian subgroups with trivial intersection , it follows that no ( non - identity ) element of @xmath154 commutes with every element of @xmath153 ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "let @xmath158 be a set of generators of @xmath153 .",
    "for any particular element @xmath159 , we can define the syndrome @xmath160 which is an @xmath5-tuple whose @xmath53-th component is given by @xmath161 . here",
    "@xmath162 if @xmath163 and @xmath57 commute and @xmath164 if @xmath163 and @xmath57 anticommute .",
    "then it follows that if @xmath165 , @xmath166 , then @xmath167 ( since otherwise @xmath168 , and @xmath169 would commute with every element of @xmath153 ) .    in particular",
    ", since there are @xmath137 elements of @xmath154 and @xmath137 different possible values of @xmath170 , it follows that each value of @xmath170 is used exactly once .",
    "thus , we can choose @xmath171 such that @xmath172 ( where @xmath173 is the vector that is @xmath174 in the @xmath53-th position and @xmath175 elsewhere ) .",
    "that is , @xmath176 anticommutes with @xmath177 and commutes with @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "the @xmath176 s are independent ( because their @xmath170 vectors are independent ) and they commute with each other ( because @xmath154 is abelian ) .",
    "therefore , the set of @xmath177 s and @xmath176 s have the same commutation / anticommutation relationships as the @xmath180 s and the @xmath181 s , so there exists a clifford group operation that maps @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "this provides the appropriate map on @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "qed    this lemma can be adapted so it applies also to @xmath4-dimensional registers , the main difference being that the syndrome function @xmath160 assumes values which are vectors modulo @xmath4 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an immediate consequence of this lemma is that for any complete set of pauli mub @xmath184 , we can choose any two of its bases , represented by stabilizers @xmath153 and @xmath154 , and find a clifford group operation that will map @xmath184 to another complete set of mub containing the bases @xmath185 and @xmath186 ; and in particular , this clifford group operation will map @xmath153 to @xmath185 and @xmath154 to @xmath186 .    therefore , if we have a general unitary @xmath142 that maps pauli mub @xmath140 to pauli mub @xmath141 , we can choose bases @xmath187 with @xmath188 , @xmath189 ( so @xmath190 ) , and then find clifford operations @xmath191 and @xmath192 which map @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 .",
    "then it follows that @xmath197 , @xmath198 . denoting @xmath199",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath151 is a clifford group operator iff @xmath142 is a clifford group operation .",
    "thus , to prove theorem  [ thm : mubequiv ] , it will be sufficient to prove    [ thm : auxxz ] if @xmath151 is a unitary operation which preserves both the @xmath147 basis and the @xmath149 basis ( i.e. , maps eigenstates of @xmath185 to other eigenstates of this set of operators , and the same is valid for eigenstates of @xmath186 ) , then @xmath151 is a clifford group operation , up to a global phase .    *",
    "proof : *    since @xmath151 preserves the @xmath147 basis , it has the form of a classical gate with possibly some phases changed : @xmath200 with @xmath201 a permutation of the @xmath137 possible values of @xmath202 .    in terms of the @xmath147 basis , we can expand elements of the @xmath149 basis as follows : @xmath203 therefore , @xmath204 in order to preserve the @xmath149 basis , we need @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a permutation of the values of @xmath207 . equating ( [ eqn : ufromz ] ) and ( [ eqn : ufromx ] ) , we find @xmath208 this must be true for all @xmath207 and @xmath202 .",

    "it then follows that @xmath215 must be affine in @xmath202 : @xmath216 ( where @xmath217 is an invertible @xmath218 binary matrix ) and thus , by ( [ eq : phig ] ) , @xmath219 is also affine in @xmath202 : @xmath220 with @xmath221 and @xmath222",
    ".    thus we find @xmath223 we can easily identify this as a clifford group operation , up to the global phase @xmath224 : @xmath225 can be performed with cnot gates , @xmath226 can be performed with @xmath149 operations , and @xmath227 can be performed with @xmath147 operations .",
    "qed    the proof for @xmath4-dimensional registers is almost identical , except that we must replace @xmath228 everywhere with @xmath229 , and we need scalar multiplication gates as well as sum gates to perform @xmath230 @xcite .    for prime hilbert space dimensions",
    "there is a unique pauli mub construction that uses _ all _ stabilizer states @xcite . in that case",
    "our set of pure classical states coincides with the set of stabilizer states , and our group of classical unitaries @xmath135 coincides with the clifford group .",
    "this is not the case for power - of - prime dimensions , where a complete set of pauli mub contains only a proper subset of the stabilizer states , resulting in classical unitaries @xmath135 which form a proper subgroup of the clifford group .",
    "the gottesman - knill theorem @xcite states that clifford group operations on stabilizer states can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer .",
    "thus , our theorems [ thm : statics ] and [ thm : mubequiv ] guarantee that the group of classical unitaries @xmath135 applied on the set of classical pure states in @xmath99 can be efficiently simulated , i.e. with a number of time - steps that increases only polynomially in the number of qubits .",
    "this is to be contrasted with general quantum computation , which uses states and operations outside of our classical sets , and which is thought to provide exponential speedup for some problems .",
    "the necessity of negativity of @xmath0 for achieving universal quantum computation had been noted in @xcite for a particular computational model proposed recently by bravyi and kitaev @xcite .    our results point to an interesting convergence between two different notions of classicality .",
    "the first defines classical states as those whose description can be made in terms of non - negative quasi - probability distributions , in this case the discrete wigner functions of @xcite .",
    "the second is motivated by quantum computation : classical states and operations are those which can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer . for a related discussion of simulability in the context of continuous variables",
    "see @xcite .    in this section and the previous one we only made claims of classicality for",
    "_ pure _ states in @xmath99 and their associated unitary dynamics .",
    "the problem seems to become much more involved when we consider mixed states in @xmath99 and their associated dynamics , which in this case will be ( in general non - unitary ) completely positive maps .",
    "it is not clear whether an efficient simulation scheme for this more general definition of classical dynamics can be devised .",
    "we have just shown that when we build a complete set of mub using pauli operators , the ` classical ' unitaries in @xmath135 turn out to form a subgroup of the clifford group .",
    "the exact characterization of this subgroup will depend on which pauli mub construction we pick . in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to the construction for @xmath163 qubits sketched in section [ sec : wignerdef ] , and present some ` classical ' unitaries in @xmath135 together with their associated action in phase space .",
    "operators in @xmath135 map translations @xmath231 into @xmath232 ( up to a sign ) ; representation of the transformation of translations under the action of : a ) translation operators ; b ) discrete squeezing ; c ) fourier transform.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in @xcite it was shown that the pauli operators act as discrete phase - space translations mapping phase - space lines into other lines .",
    "this means that the pauli operators themselves are in our group @xmath135 .",
    "translation operators @xmath233 operate on quantum states in such a way that their wigner functions are transformed as flows : each phase - space point operator is mapped into another one because of the covariance condition imposed on the quantum net .",
    "thus , the effect of a translation operator on a state s wigner function is a translation in phase space , and in this sense its action is `` classical - like '' . since translation operators act as flows in phase space , they preserve positivity of @xmath0 for any single association between lines and mub projectors .      the discrete squeezing operator @xcite maps the horizontal and the vertical striations into themselves , while cycling through all oblique striations . an explicit clifford circuit for @xmath234",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "when acting on translation operators , @xmath234 maps them into other translations in a way that resembles a squeezing flow in phase space ( see fig .",
    "1.b ) : @xmath235    besides covariance with respect to the discrete phase - space translations , we can impose on the quantum net also the constraint of covariance under @xmath234 . in doing so",
    ", the freedom in picking the quantum net will be limited to the choice of which mub projector to associate to a fixed oblique line , since the covariance requirement determines all other associations . in this way",
    ", the number of possible choices is greatly reduced from @xmath95 to @xmath4 .",
    "if we choose a quantum net which is covariant under the squeezing operator , it can be shown that @xmath234 will map phase - space point operators into other point operators , i.e. @xmath234 acts like a phase - space flow .",
    "this may not be the case if the quantum net is not chosen to be covariant under @xmath234 .    by definition ,",
    "the group @xmath135 consists of unitaries that preserve non - negativity of the wigner function @xmath0 for all possible quantum nets .",
    "this does not imply that operators in @xmath135 will preserve positivity for any single definition of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because some states may have positive @xmath0 for a single definition , but negative @xmath0 for other definitions ( and hence lie outside the set @xmath99 ) . in the case of @xmath234 ,",
    "preservation of positivity for each single definition of @xmath0 is only guaranteed when @xmath234 acts as a flow in phase space , and this only happens when the quantum net is chosen to be covariant with respect to @xmath234 .",
    "the finite fourier transform @xmath236 @xcite maps the horizontal and the vertical striations into one another ; oblique striations are interchanged in pairs , and one of them [ the `` main diagonal '' , which corresponds to the eigenstates of the set of translations obtained by setting @xmath237 in eq .",
    "( [ eqsetpaulis ] ) ] is mapped into itself . for the particular case in which the canonical basis of the galois field is self - dual",
    ", @xmath236 is just the hadamard transform .",
    "the effect of @xmath236 on the translation operators is  up to a sign  a reflection with respect to the main diagonal of phase space ( see fig .",
    "1.c ) : @xmath238    the fact that @xmath236 interchanges translation operators by a reflection might suggest that its action on the states could be analogous , that is , that @xmath236 could reflect a state s wigner function with respect to the main diagonal , perhaps for some particular quantum nets ( as is the case with @xmath234 ) .    for @xmath236 to act on lines as a reflection with respect to the main diagonal , there should be one mub projector associated to the axis of reflection , and @xmath236 should map this projector into itself .",
    "this projector should , then , be a common eigenstate of @xmath236 and all the paulis that define the basis to which the state belongs .",
    "using the fact that @xmath236 anti - commutes with some of them , and that the eigenvalues of @xmath236 and the paulis are different from zero , it can be seen that no state can fulfill this requirement .",
    "thus , there is no association between lines and mub projectors that makes the action of @xmath236 on the wigner function be a reflection flow .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that there is no quantum net for which @xmath236 acts as a flow in any way , because for @xmath236 to be a flow it should map phase - space point operators into other point operators .",
    "for this to happen , the @xmath15 lines that intersect in any given point must be mapped by @xmath236 into other lines that intersect in only one point .",
    "the vertical and the horizontal rays ( i.e. lines containing the origin ) are interchanged by @xmath236 , so the other rays must be mapped into rays too ( so that all the resulting lines intersect at the origin ) .",
    "this requires the ray in the main diagonal to be mapped into itself , and , as pointed out in the previous paragraph , this can not be achieved .",
    "therefore , @xmath236 provides an example of an operator in @xmath135 which can not be interpreted in terms of a flow for any choice of associations between lines and states , and so has no obvious continuous phase - space analogue .",
    "we have characterized the set @xmath99 of states whose discrete wigner functions @xmath0 ( as defined in @xcite ) are non - negative .",
    "we showed that the only pure states in @xmath99 are the mutually unbiased bases projectors used to define @xmath0 , as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "since these projectors can always be chosen to be stabilizer states , they admit an efficient classical description using the stabilizer formalism .",
    "moreover , we proved that the unitaries which preserve non - negativity of @xmath0 for all such functions @xmath0 form a subgroup of the clifford group .",
    "it is known that clifford operations on stabilizer states can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer .",
    "we have thus identified a relation between two different notions of classicality : states which are classical in the sense of having non - negative quasi - probability distributions ( the discrete wigner functions of @xcite ) can also be simulated efficiently on classical computers . since general quantum computation is thought to be hard to simulate classically , our results mean that negativity of @xmath0 is _ necessary _ for exponential computational speedup with pure states .",
    "there are many open problems worth investigating .",
    "the complete characterization of non - negativity preserving unitaries for different constructions of complete sets of mub is still unsolved",
    ". it would also be interesting if one could relate non - classicality to negativity of @xmath0 in a _ quantitative _ way .",
    "another research direction is to investigate the relationship between @xmath0 and a notable open problem , that of the existence of complete sets of mutually unbiased bases for general hilbert space dimensions ( see @xcite ) .",
