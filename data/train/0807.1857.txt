    "optical investigations of atomic impurities in superfluid helium nanodroplets have drawn considerable attention in recent years,@xcite as the shifts of the electronic transition lines ( atomic shifts ) are a very useful observable to determine the location of the foreign atom attached to a helium drop.@xcite in this context , the study of magnesium atoms attached to helium drops has unraveled an interesting and somewhat unexpected solvation behaviour as a function of the number ( @xmath8 ) of helium atoms in the drop .",
    "diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations@xcite carried out for small drops containing a number of helium atoms up to @xmath9 indicate that a mg atom is not fully solvated in drops of sizes below @xmath10 .",
    "more recent quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite suggest a surface mg state for @xmath0he clusters with up to @xmath11 atoms .",

    "there is some ambiguity associated with the notion of solvation in a helium droplet . for not too small droplets , one may consider that mg is fully solvated when its position inside the droplet is such that its solvation energy or atomic shift do not appreciably differ from their asymptotic values in bulk liquid helium , as both quantities approach such limit fairly alongside .",
    "however , for very small drops the energy or atomic shifts of an impurity atom at the center of the drop may still differ appreciably from the bulk liquid values because there is not enough helium to saturate these quantities .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , of mg@@xmath0he@xmath14 studied in ref . .",
    "mella et al.@xcite have discussed how the solvation properties of magnesium are affected by the number of helium atoms in small @xmath0he drops . since dmc calculations",
    "can not be extended to the very large drops involved in lif experiments,@xcite they could not carry out a detailed comparison between their calculated atomic shifts and the experiments .",
    "they also pointed out the sensitivity of the mg solvation properties on apparently small differences in the he - mg pair potentials available in the literature .",
    "the aim of the present work is to re - examine the solvation of magnesium in @xmath0he nanodroplets from the dft perspective , extending our previous calculations@xcite down to drops with @xmath15 atoms and improving the dft approach ( i ) by treating the dopant as a quantal particle instead of as an external field , and ( ii ) by fully taking into account the coupling of the dipole excitation of the impurity with the dynamical deformations of the helium around the mg atom .",
    "our results confirm that full solvation of a mg atom in @xmath0he drops requires a minimum number of helium atoms , and disclose some unusual results for small drops .",

    "in recent years , static and time - dependent density functional methods@xcite have become increasingly popular to study inhomogeneous liquid helium systems because they provide an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational effort , allowing to address problems inaccessible to more fundamental approaches .",

    "the main reason is that these coordinates allow to use fast fourier transformation techniques@xcite to efficiently compute the convolution integrals entering the definition of @xmath22 , i.e. the mean field helium potential and the coarse - grained density needed to compute the correlation term in the he density functional , @xcite as well as the fields defined in eq .",

    "[ fig2 ] the @xmath46 values here obtained with those of ref . , where the mg atom was treated as an infinitely massive particle -i.e . , as a fixed external field acting on the @xmath0he drop . the neglect of the quantum kinetic energy of the impurity overestimates the impurity solvation energies by quite a large amount , about 19.7 k for @xmath9 and 18.8 k for @xmath47 .",

    "it can be seen that @xmath55 in both cases displays two local minima . in one case ( i.e. for the sligtly less attractive potential in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) a `` surface '' state for the mg atom is energetically preferred , while in the other case the impurity prefers to sit in the interior to the droplet ( although not exactly at its center ) .",
    "these results are in agreement with the dmc calculations of ref . , where it has been shown that a bimodal distributions for the mg radial probability density function with respect to the center - of - mass of the helium moiety appears for @xmath56.@xcite more recent dmc calculations carried out up to @xmath57 drops@xcite seem to point out that mg is always in a surface state , although somewhat beneath the drop surface .",
    "our dft calculations yield that mg is already solvated for @xmath58 .    for both pair potentials , the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that the two local minima in @xmath55 are separated by an energy barrier of about 1 k height , allowing the impurity to temporarily visit , even at the experimental temperature @xmath59 k , the less energetically favored site .",
    "this causes changes in the total energy of the system by less that 1 % , but has a large effect on the value of the atomic shift .",
    "we will address this important issue , and its consequencies on the computed spectral properties of mg@he@xmath12 in the next sections .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the helium configurations for the four stationary points displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , namely those corresponding to @xmath60 , 2 , 4 , and 6  .",
    "although the preference for the surface or the solvated state depends on the he - mg pair potential used in the calculations , similarly to the case of other alkali atoms,@xcite this does not seem to be the case for the stationary points at @xmath61 and 4  that are present in both curves .",
    "we have compared in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the density profiles along the @xmath25 axis for the @xmath62  configuration with the profile of the pure @xmath0he drop , finding that the appearence of these stationary points is related to the position of the density peak in the first helium solvation shell with respect to a maximum(minimum ) of the density of the pure drop .",
    "we see that a minimum(maximum ) in the energy is associated with a constructive(destructive ) interference in the oscillation pattern of the he density . we are lead to conclude that the interplay between the density oscillations already present in pure drops , and the solvation shells generated by the impurity plays an important role in the solvation properties of the mg atom .",
    "this effect is also present , although to a lesser extent , in ca - doped @xmath0he",
    "nanodroplets.@xcite    eventually , for larger drops mg becomes fully solvated .",
    "we have found that this is the case whichever of these two potentials we use ( see for instance the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . for this reason ,",
    "the results we discuss in the following have been obtained with the mg - he pair potential of ref .",
    ", unless differently stated .",
    "when the mg atom is fully solvated , e.g. for @xmath63 , we have found that @xmath55 grows monotonously as @xmath24 increases ( i.e. as the mg atom approaches the droplet surface ) .",

    "[ fig6 ] the energy of the @xmath63 and 2000 doped drops , referred to their equilibrium value , as a function of the distance from the dividing surface , i.e. the radius @xmath64 at which the density of the pure drop equals @xmath65 , @xmath66 being the liquid density value ( @xmath67 , with @xmath68 2.22  ) .",
    "these radii are 22.2 and 28.0  for @xmath63 and 2000 , respectively .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows that most of the change in @xmath69 takes place in the 15  outer region of the drop , irrespective of its size . as a consequence of the flatness of @xmath55 ,",
    "the magnesium atom is very delocalized in the radial direction even in relatively small drops .",
    "this delocalization might affect the absorption spectrum of the attached mg atom , and also must be explicitly considered in the interpretation of the electron - impact yield experiments.@xcite we address this issue in sec .",
    "lax method@xcite offers a realistic way to study the absorption spectrum of a foreign atom embedded in liquid drops .",
    "it makes use of the franck - condon principle within a semiclassical approach , and it has been widely employed to study the absorption spectrum of atomic dopants attached to @xmath0he drops , see e.g. ref . and references therein . the method is usually applied in conjunction with the diatomics - in - molecules theory,@xcite which means that the atom - drop complex is treated as a diatomic molecule , where the helium moiety plays a role of the other atom .    in the original formalism , to obtain the line shape one has to carry out an average on the possible initial states of the system that may be thermally populated .",
    "usually , this average is not needed for helium drops , as their temperature , about @xmath70 k,@xcite is much smaller than the vibrational excitation energies of the mg atom in the mean field represented by the second of eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) . in small helium droplets",
    "thermal effects can show up in the mg absorption spectrum due to the high mobility of the atom .",
    "for large drops , thermal motion plays a minor role , as the mg atom hardly gets close enough to the drop surface to have some effect on the line shape . in this case , however , dynamical deformations of the cavity around the impurity may be relevant.@xcite    the line shape for electronic transitions from the ground state @xmath71 to the excited state @xmath72 in a condensed phase system can be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the matrix element of the electric dipole operator , @xmath75 is the ground state of the system , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the hamiltonians that describe the ground and excited states of the system respectively .",
