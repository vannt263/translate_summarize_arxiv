    ", there remains several important issues that need to be resolved .",
    "first , when a ti is in contact with a ferromagnetic material , the coupling between them may not be weak .",
    "consequently , the magnetic material may become nonmagnetic at the interface @xcite or the magnetic substrate bands can be dominant near the fermi level with the absence of ti surface states @xcite .",
    "second , when magnetic atoms such as fe or cr were doped in a ti @xcite , it was reported that the dopants may form clusters rather than being uniformly distributed without ferromagnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "last , the magnetic easy axis of a magnetic ti may not be perpendicular to the surface @xcite .    considering these issues ,",
    "an interface between a ferromagnetic insulator ( fmi ) and a ti with a magnetic easy axis normal to the surface , is a good candidate system to study the magnetic proximity effect @xcite . in this regard , a superlattice of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ( ti ) interfaced with mnse ( fmi ) in the presence of inversion symmetry ( is ) was theoretically studied @xcite . in this case",
    ", the dirac surface states identified in ref.@xcite are not truly ti surface states because the ti surface - surface hybridization greatly increases with decreasing the fmi thickness .",
    "the large contamination of the dirac surface states by the fmi is consistent with the result in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition , the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/mnse interface has not been experimentally realized yet , and it has a lattice mismatch of 1.9 % .",
    "recently , the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/eus interface has been fabricated and their transport properties have been measured @xcite , where the lattice mismatch is less than 1  % and the structure has broken is with the magnetic easy axis normal to the interface ( @xmath2 axis ) .",
    "there are no theoretical studies of the magnetic proximity effect at this interface yet .",
    "one interesting feature of the ti arising from strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is that the orbitals forming the topological surface states are highly coupled to a particular spin texture .",
    "this spin - orbital texture were studied for pristine tis @xcite , and it was shown to be controlled by the polarization of incident photons @xcite .",
    "therefore , an interesting question is how the spin - orbital texture of the surface states is modified by the magnetic proximity effect .    in this work",
    ", we present the spin - orbital texture and electronic structure of the surface states induced by the magnetic proximity effect at the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/eus interface , using first - principles and effective model calculations .",

    "the first - principles calculations show that three massive dirac cones are present , and that eus - dominated bands do not appear near the fermi level . among the three dirac cones , the states localized into the top ( bottom ) ti surface have an energy gap of 9  mev ( less than 1 mev ) , while a new dirac cone slightly deeper into the top ti surface has an energy gap of 2 mev . by constructing a low - energy effective model for the surface states",

    "[ fig : density](a ) . the magnetic moments of the interfacial eu and the atoms in the topmost ql ( labeled in fig .",

    "our result of the top - surface cone differs from that at the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/mnse interface @xcite in three aspects .",
    "firstly , for the latter , the states giving the largest energy gap of about 50 mev , are localized mostly into the mnse region and the interfacial se atom , rather than into the topmost ql . in our case , not only the top - surface dirac cone is localized into the topmost ql , but also the orbitals representing the dirac cone are similar to those for the top - surface and bottom - surface dirac cones in a pristine bi@xmath0se@xmath1 slab .",
    "this feature is applied to not just near the @xmath29 point but in the whole @xmath13 space .",

    "thirdly , the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/mnse system has some ambiguity in determination of an interface in comparison to our system , because the interfacial se atom could be considered as part of both bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and mnse .",

    "three small quantitative differences are as follows . compared to the top - surface states , ( i ) @xmath107 increases by 0.048 - 0.059@xmath33 ; ( ii ) @xmath116 decreases by 0.019 - 0.028@xmath33 ; ( iii ) @xmath117 and @xmath118 decrease by 0.022 - 0.028 and 0.007 - 0.012@xmath33 , respectively , where the two different numbers for each difference come from the upper and lower dirac cone .",
    "the differences in the @xmath74 and @xmath75 components of the spin moment arise because the orbitals of the new surface states slightly differs from those of the top - surface states .",
    "the new surface states have larger contributions from the @xmath3 orbital and smaller contributions from the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals than the top - surface states .",
    "the difference in the @xmath2 component originates from the fact that the new dirac surface states are localized slightly deeper into the ti slab , relative to the top and bottom - surface states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the proximity effect of the eus film is weaker on the new dirac surface states than on the top - surface states .",
    "in summary , we investigated the magnetic proximity effect on the electronic structure and spin - orbital texture of the dirac surface states from the bi@xmath0se@xmath1/eus slab through first - principles calculations and the effective model .",
    "the dirac surface states localized into the ql right next to the interface , open up an energy gap of 9  mev , independently of the ti slab thickness for slabs as thick as 3 qls or beyond .",
    "however , the dirac surface states localized into the other side of the interface , remains gapless .",
    "these features of the gaps are due to the short - ranged induced magnetic moments into the ti slab .",
    "for the 5ql / eus slab , we found that a new dirac cone was formed with an energy gap of 2 mev , while there was no such new dirac cone for the 3ql / eus slab .",
    "we constructed the effective model hamiltonian which includes surface - surface interaction , magnetic proximity effect , and band bending , in order to explain the gap of the top and bottom - surface dirac cones . by setting the spin - orbital basis for the model hamiltonian",
    ", we computed the spin - orbital texture with broken time reversal symmetry and this calculated result agree with the dft calculations .",

    "<S> we investigate a magnetic proximity effect on dirac surface states of topological insulator ( ti ) induced by a bi@xmath0se@xmath1/eus interface , using density - functional theory ( dft ) and a low - energy effective model , motivated by a recent experimental realization of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a thin ferromagnetic insulator eus film stacked on top of bi@xmath0se@xmath1(111 ) slabs of three or five quintuple layers ( qls ) with the magnetization of eus normal to the interface ( @xmath2 axis ) , which breaks both time - reversal and inversion symmetry . it is found that a charge transfer and surface relaxation makes the dirac cones electron - doped . </S>",
    "<S> for both 3 and 5 qls , the top - surface dirac cone has an energy gap of 9 mev , while the bottom surface dirac cone remains gapless . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is due to the short - ranged induced magnetic moment of the eus film . </S>",
    "<S> for the 5 qls , an additional dirac cone with an energy gap of 2 mev is formed right below the bottom - surface dirac point , while for 3 qls , there is no additional dirac cone . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the spin - orbital texture of the dirac surface states with broken inversion symmetry , using dft and the effective model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath3 orbital is coupled to the @xmath2 component of the spin moment in the opposite sign to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 and radial @xmath6 orbitals are coupled to the in - plane spin texture in the opposite handedness to the tangential @xmath6 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> the result obtained from the effective model agrees with our dft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spin - orbital texture may be tested from spin - polarized angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy . </S>"
