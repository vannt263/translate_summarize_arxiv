    "only one case of marginal 22 @xmath3 m excess was recovered , coming from a well - known debris disk bearing member au mic .",
    "this implies that m - type stars with spectral types between m0 and m6 exhibiting mid - ir excess are very likely young ( age @xmath0 10 myr ) .",
    "one can utilize this association of mid - ir excess and youth as a new search method for identifying nearby , young ( @xmath710 myr ) , late - type stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in this age range should all show additional unambiguous indicators of youth , such as strong h@xmath1 emission , lithium absorption , low - gravity spectral features , etc .",
    "therefore , the youth of any candidate young m - type object discovered by its excess emission at mid - ir wavelengths can be evaluated with follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "although several young ( @xmath0100 myr ) , nearby ( @xmath880 pc ) moving groups were identified during the past decade ( @xcite , @xcite ) , these include few low - mass members ( spectral types later than @xmath2m3 ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that unambiguous identification of young m - type stars is difficult if a well - measured trigonometric parallax is missing",
    ". some activity indicators ( e.g. h@xmath1 emission , x - ray emission ) can not readily discern young ( @xmath0100 myr ) stars from a pool of old ( @xmath9600 myr ) field stars @xcite .",
    "the li @xmath106708 absorption feature , an effective age indicator for young fgk - type stars in the age range of 10 - 100 myr , becomes increasingly sensitive to mass and age for m - type stars .",
    "the age at which a star becomes hot enough to burn lithium in its core can be seen in the so - called `` lithium depletion boundary '' , which can affect early to mid - m type stars at ages as young as the bpmg ( @xmath212 myr ) .",
    "some young m - type stars have been identified , though they are either co - moving companions of earlier spectral types or in a group of very young ( @xmath010 myr ) stars that are relatively confined to a small region of the sky ( e.g. twa and the subregions of the scorpius centaurus complex ) . with a well - measured trigonometric parallax , one can find a young m - type field star ( e.g. ap col ; @xcite ) , however , a systematic search for young m - type stars needs to wait for the next generation of parallax missions , such as _ gaia _ , _ pan - starrs _ , etc .",
    "using the fact that random field m - type stars with mid - ir excess are extremely rare , one can search for @xmath010 myr m - type stars in the solar neighborhood with wise data .",
    "these additional youngest m - type post t - tauri stars can give an important clue to the mass function of young nearby stellar associations .",
    "the tw hydrae association is one of the nearest ( d@xmath230 - 90pc ) star forming regions .",
    "its proximity , in combination with its young age make it an ideal area for the study of stellar , planetary , and circumstellar disk evolution .",
    "it has also been shown to be useful as a testbed for the evaluation and implementation of new techniques to identify young stars ( e.g. uv - excess ; @xcite , @xcite ) . for the above reasons , we have chosen to examine the tw hydrae association in a pilot study to find young , m - type stars by their mid - ir excess emission .",

    ", we find a source with a flux of 5.0 mjy in wise channel 4 corresponds to a magnitude of @xmath28.1 mag .",

    "after the wise image screening , 51 candidates remained .",
    "this list was then cross - matched with simbad .",
    "twelve sources were found to be either extragalactic or pulsating variable stars .",
    "one object ( 2mass 13373839 - 4736297 ) , is a known young m - dwarf first discovered by @xcite in their search for young stars utilizing uv - excess .",
    "@xcite show that this star , with an estimated spectral type of m3.5 and distance of 126 pc , shows youthful characteristics in its spectrum .",
    "they measure an h@xmath1 equivalent width of 13.7 in emission , and a li @xmath106708 equivalent width of 308 m .",
    "this object is likely a member of lower - centaurus crux region ( d@xmath295 pc , age @xmath210 myr ; @xcite ) of the scorpius centaurus association , based on its estimated distance and proper motion .",
    "this is the first evidence for mid - ir excess for this star , which shows that our search method is likely to be useful for other areas of the sky , such as the sub - regions of the scorpius - centarus complex .",
    "six confirmed twa members were recovered ( twa 3a , 27 , 28 , 30a , 31 , and 32 ) . the lone late - type ( m4 ) , mid - ir excess twa member not returned with our search method was twa 30b .",
    "this object did not meet our selection criteria because its photospheric emission is heavily obscured up to at least wise channel 2 , likely due to its edge - on disk geometry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for the remaining 32 candidates , we cross - match their positions with the ppmxl catalog of positions and proper motions @xcite to inspect for any candidates that have measured proper motions consistent with that of known twa members .",
    "to select the best candidates , we require that the total proper motion magnitude and direction be within 1@xmath14 of the average of confirmed twa members",
    ". thirty of the candidates show inconsistent proper motions . the last two remaining candidates ( 2mass 11393382 - 3040002 and 2mass 10284580 - 2830374 ) , with proper motions consistent with known members of twa ( see figure 1 ) ,",
    "are discussed in detail in the following section .",
    "to check for the expected signatures of youth for an m - type twa member , candidates 2m1139 and 2m1028 were followed up spectroscopically with the wide field spectrograph ( wifes ; @xcite ) on the 2.3 m telescope located at the siding spring observatory .",
    "2m1139 was observed on 2012 may 30 and 2m1028 was observed on 2012 august 3 .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the @xmath15 and @xmath16 gratings that cover the wavelength ranges 3400 to 6000 a and 5600 to 9500 a , respectively , with a resolution of r @xmath2 3000 .",
    "a portion of each spectrum containing the h@xmath1 emission line and the li @xmath106708 absorption line is shown in figure 3 ( 2m1139 ) and figure 4 ( 2m1028 ) .",
    "2m1139 closely resembles the average combined spectrum of old field dwarfs gj 299 ( m4.5 ) and gj 551 ( m6 ) , while 2m1028 most closely resembles gj 551 .",
    "a comparison of each candidate twa member with these spectra shows a considerable weakening of mgh , cah , caoh , ki and nai features compared to old field dwarfs with similar tio band strengths ( figures 3 & 4 ) .",
    "as seen in table 1 , each candidate shows moderate h@xmath1 emission and strong lithium absorption .",
    "@xcite show that indices derived from spectroscopic features that are sensitive to a star s surface gravity can be used to distinguish relative age differences of nearby clusters and moving groups . in particular , for stars of spectral type m3 and later , the na i @xmath108183/8195 doublet index shows a distinct difference between field dwarfs ( strong absorption ) , young stars ( @xmath012 myr ) ( reduced absorption ) , and giants , in which the feature is mostly absent .",
    "we measure a na i index for both candidates , and , using their r - i colors from our flux - calibrated spectra , compare their values with the na i index - color relations for various stellar groups from @xcite in figure 5 .",
    "vri colors ( in the johnson - cousins system ) were computed from our flux - calibrated spectrum for each candidate , and are listed in table 1 .",
    "we estimate the photometry is accurate to within @xmath170.01 - 0.02 mags .",
    "as seen in the figure , the na i index of each candidate suggests a low surface gravity , and an age similar to twa .",
    "this low - gravity feature , along with the measured equivalent widths of the h@xmath1 emission and lithium absorption lines , given in table 1 , confirm the youth of both candidates .    as mentioned in @xcite , for most cases , the determining factor between membership in twa and the further away , lower - centaurus crux ( lcc ) region of the scorpius centaurus complex is distance , with a possible boundary between the two regions occurring near 100 pc .",
    "we estimate the distance to each candidate twa members in two ways .",
    "first , we calculate a photometric distance using our measured spectral type in combination with an empirical isochrone for known twa members .",
    "we estimate a spectral type of m4.7 @xmath17 0.5 for 2m1139 and m4.9 @xmath17 0.5 for 2m1028 using the tio5 index as described in @xcite . placing these candidates on the empirical twa isochrone",
    ", we estimate an absolute k magnitude of @xmath26.0 mag and @xmath26.5 mag for 2m1139 and 2m1028 , respectively . from these absolute magnitudes ,",
    "we calculate a photometric distance of @xmath241 pc for 2m1139 and @xmath250 pc for 2m1028 .",
    "uncertainties using this method are typically @xmath220% .",
    "we also estimate the kinematic distance by obtaining a kinematic parallax following the method described in @xcite .",
    "the mean velocity of twa was calculated using parameters of confirmed members from @xcite .",
    "the adopted twa space velocity is ( u , v , w ) = ( -10.8 , -18.1 , -4.4 ) km s@xmath18 . as with twa 30a and twa 30b , which have sky positions and proper motions similar to that of 2m1139 ( see figure 1 ) , we find that almost all space motion is directed toward the twa convergent point ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . from this motion",
    ", we calculate a kinematic parallax of 23.6 @xmath17 1.8 mas , corresponding to a distance of 42 @xmath17 3 pc . for 2m1028",
    ", we calculate a kinematic parallax of 20.3 @xmath17 1.7 mas , which corresponds to a distance of 49 @xmath17 4 pc .",
    "both estimates are in excellent agreement with our calculated photometric distances .",
    "these distance estimates put each candidate well on the twa side of the @xmath2100 pc dividing line between twa and the lcc .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that uv - excess is an effective tool for identifying young , m - type objects .",
    "we searched for any evidence of uv - excess using the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; @xcite ) and found that 2m1139 has not been covered in the most recent data release .",
    "2m1028 was detected by galex , with a near ultraviolet ( nuv ) magnitude of 22.325 @xmath17 0.397 mag . with a 2mass j - k color of 0.93 mag , and a nuv - j color of 11.37 mag",
    ", we note that this object would pass the selection criteria outlined in @xcite for young stars candidates , namely nuv - j @xmath8 10.20(j - k ) + 2.2 , indicative of a young age .",
    "the combination of position , proper motion , spectral signatures of youth , distance estimates , mid - ir excess , and , in the case of 2m1028 , uv - excess , lead us to the conclusion that 2mass 1139 and 2m1028 are indeed authentic members of the tw hydrae association .",
    "following the naming convention for twa members , we designate 2m1139 twa 33 and 2m1028 twa 34 .",
    "the properties of twa 33 and twa 34 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "figure 6 includes a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that shows the mid - ir excess emission of each new member .",
    "also shown is the sed of a likely lcc member 2m1337 , first identified as a young star by @xcite , the infrared excess of which was discovered in our search .",
    "we note that , at the age of twa or younger , use of mid - ir excess as a search method is highly effective for tw hydrae members with spectral types of m4 or later . including twa 33 and twa 34 , there are 16 twa members with spectral types in this range .",
    "fourteen of these were individually detected with wise ( twa 3b and 5b are too close to their primary members to be resolved individually ) .",
    "nine of these fourteen members show significant mid - ir excess emission , eight of which were found with our search method .",
    "the discovery of twa 33 and twa 34 demonstrates the effectiveness of using mid - ir excess as a tool to identify nearby , young , late - type stars .",
    "these stars show many signatures of youth expected for a twa member , such as h@xmath1 emission , lithium absorption , and low surface gravity spectral features . using two different methods",
    ", we estimate a distance of @xmath0 50 pc for both stars , consistent with their twa membership .",
    "we also rediscovered the young , likely lcc member 2m1337 , first identified as a young star by @xcite , and found evidence for the presence of a circumstellar disk around this star .",
    "considering the high fraction of late - type mid - ir excess stars from twa and the slightly younger @xmath5 cha association ( 45% for m - type members - schneider et al .",
    "2012 ) , we believe that mid - ir excess can be a a useful tool in identifying more young , nearby , late - type stars and brown dwarfs",
    ". one can expand our search for these objects to other areas of interest , such as the sub - regions of the scorpius - centaurus association , or even the entire sky .",
    "an interesting conjecture is whether there is a higher fraction of mid - ir excess stars among the latest m spectral types ( m6 or later ) .",
    "for the six known twa members with spectral type later than m6 , three ",
    "twa 27 , 30a and 32  were detected individually by wise to have excess emission in channel 4 .",
    "twa 5b , an m8 dwarf companion to twa 5a , is too close to its primary to be resolved .",
    "twa 26 and twa 29 have only upper limits in wise channel 4 , so no strong conclusions regarding mid - ir excess can be deduced from wise for these members , though twa 26 shows no excess at 24 @xmath3 m via spitzer mips @xcite . in summary ,",
    "all wise detectable late m - type twa members show mid - ir excess emission at the w4 band . to date , no members of the @xmath5 cha cluster have been found with spectral types later than m6 , though searches have been performed @xcite .",
    "the bpmg has two known late - type members ( excluding giant planet @xmath11 pictoris b ) , hr 7329b ( m7.5 ; @xcite ) and 2mass 0608 - 27 ( m8.5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "hr 7329b is too close to its host star to be resolved individually with wise , and 2mass 0608 - 27 has an upper limit in wise channel 4 .",
    "so , at this point , only twa has a reasonable number of latest m - type members to check the conjecture of even more prolonged disks among the latest m - type stars .",
    "future missions , such as _ gaia _ , which should discover more late - type members of these nearby associations , will allow us to test the hypothesis that primordial disks have longer lifetimes around later - spectral types in this spectral type range .",
    "while we have shown that mid - ir excess emission can be a useful tool for identifying nearby , young , late - type stars and brown dwarfs , caution must be taken when considering association properties , such as disk fraction and mass function .",
    "any objects found with this method will surely bias the measure of disk frequency for a particular group of stars , so we do not update the excess fraction for twa here . if the hypothesis of longer disk lifetimes around later spectral types is true , then any objects found with this method would bias any estimate of the mass function as well . while the question of whether or not there is a higher fraction of mid - ir excess for the latest spectral types is an interesting one , it can not be answered with objects found with the search method described in this paper .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the detection of mid - ir excess emission can be utilized to identify new nearby , young , late - type stars including two definite new members (  twa 33 \" and `` twa 34 '' ) of the tw hydrae association . </S>",
    "<S> both new twa members display mid - ir excess emission in the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) catalog and they show proper motion and youthful spectroscopic characteristics  namely h@xmath1 emission , strong lithium absorption , and low surface gravity features consistent with known twa members . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect mid - ir excess  the first unambiguous evidence of a dusty circumstellar disk  around a previously identified uv - bright , young , accreting star ( 2m1337 ) that is a likely member of the lower - centaurus crux region of the scorpius centaurus complex . </S>"
