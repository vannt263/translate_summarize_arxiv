    "in the experimental point of view , electron - nucleon scattering is one of time - honored tools to access the information of the intrinsic structures of the nucleon .",
    "these structures are partly reflected by the sachs electric ( @xmath6 ) and magnetic ( @xmath7 ) form factors .",
    "so far there are two experimental techniques to detect these form factors or the form factors ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the traditional one is the rosenbluth separation method @xcite , which extracts the form factors ratio from the angular dependence of the elastic electron - proton scattering cross section . in the one - photon exchange approximation ,",
    "the differential cross section for the @xmath9 elastic scattering process is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the momentum transfer squared , the dynamics factor @xmath12 and the photon polarization parameter @xmath13 relates to the laboratory scattering angle @xmath14 by @xmath15 . for a given value of @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ eq - dcs - ope ] ) shows that it is sufficient to determine the form factors by measuring the differential cross sections at two different values of @xmath13 .",
    "polarized lepton beams provide another way to access the form factors @xcite . in the one - photon exchange approximation ,",
    "the polarization of the recoiling proton along its motion(@xmath16 ) is proportional to @xmath17 while the component perpendicular to the motion ( @xmath18 ) is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "it is much easier to measure the ratios of polarizations .",
    "this method has been used mainly to determine the electromagnetic form factors ratio @xmath20 through a measurement of @xmath21 using @xcite @xmath22    in the framework of one - photon exchange approximation , one , therefore , has two independent measurements of the form factors ratio @xmath20 .",
    "recently , this ratio has been observed at the jefferson laboratory by the polarized method @xcite .",
    "it came as a surprise that the newly measured form factors ratio is much different from the results of the rosenbluth separations @xcite .",
    "as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq - dcs - ope ] ) , the form factors extracted from the rosenbluth separation method are strongly lie on @xmath23dependent corrections at large @xmath0 region .",
    "after re - analyzing the next leading order qed corrections , one finds that the two - photon exchange ( tpe ) process should be restudied .    in previous literatures ,",
    "there have been two different methods to study the tpe contributions in the electron proton scattering process .",
    "one is the simple hadronic model , in which the intermediate states of the tpe process are taken as baryons . the known mt corrections @xcite , which have been included in the rosenbluth separation method , are based on this model .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the mt corrections , the loop integrals of tpe contributions are evaluated by setting one of the photon s momenta to be zero in both numerators and denominators of the amplitudes , while the rest parts are ignored . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "different from the mt corrections , the tpe contributions are considered by neglecting one of the photon s momenta only in the numerators of the amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the tpe contributions are evaluated by keeping the full numerators with nucleon intermediate state .",
    "the newly estimated results show that the corrections can at least partly reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the two separation methods . in the further study",
    "more intermediate states have been taken into considerations @xcite .",
    "another approach to deal with the tpe process is the quark model . in this model , the tpe contributions are firstly considered in the quark level and then extended from the quark level to the baryon level . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contributions of tpe process have been studied at large momentum transfer and wide scattering angle region in a parton model . in these cases ,",
    "the quark mass can be neglected .",
    "the parton model can work effectively with large momentum transfer .",
    "however , the contributions of the tpe process are still unknown in the medium @xmath0 region . in this work ,",
    "we try to calculate the tpe contributions in a light - cone quark model and compare our results with the predictions of the simple hadronic model .",
    "the contributions of the tpe to unpolarized differential cross sections and polarized observables will be evaluated at medium @xmath0 and small @xmath13 regions .",
