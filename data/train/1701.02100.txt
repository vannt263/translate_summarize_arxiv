    "the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) describes a quantum phenomenon that the decay of an unstable quantum system can be frozen or suitably confined by repeated frequent measurements  @xcite . on the other hand , the reverse effect ,",
    "i.e. the acceleration of the decay process of the unstable quantum system induced by repeated frequent measurements , has also been pointed out and is known as the quantum anti - zeno effect ( qaze )  @xcite .",
    "the qze has been experimentally observed in many real physical systems , such as the trapped ion  @xcite , the superconducting josephson junction  @xcite , the ultracold atomic bose - einstein condensate  @xcite and the nuclear spin system  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , due to the unavoidable coupling with the surrounding bath , the microscopic quantum system severely undergoes decoherence which is the main difficulty in fulfilling reliable quantum computation and quantum communication tasks  @xcite . in this sense , to gain a global view and more physical insights into the qze and the qaze , the effect of the surrounding bath should be taken into consideration .",
    "almost all the existing studies of the qze and the qaze in quantum dissipative systems have restricted their attentions to some exactly solvable models , such as the pure dephasing model  @xcite and the unbiased qubit - boson model with rotating - wave approximation  @xcite , which is also called the damped jaynes - cummings model . for the unbiased qubit - boson model beyond the rotating - wave approximation  @xcite ,",
    "most of the treatments are based on the generalized silbey - harris transformation  @xcite which is valid only in the weak system - bath coupling regime .",
    "very few study focuses on the more general quantum dissipative systems , such as the biased qubit - boson model  @xcite where both the dephasing mechanism and quantum relaxation are considered in this model .",
    "many previous articles have shown that the existence of an external bias field can remarkably change the decoherence behavior of the qubit - boson model  @xcite .",
    "thus we expect that the qze and the qaze of a biased qubit - boson model is quite different from that of the unbiased case .",
    "unfortunately , the reduced dynamics of the biased qubit - boson model can not be exactly obtained , in this paper , we employ a numerical hierarchical equations of motion ( heom ) method  @xcite to study the qze and the qaze in the quantum dissipative system .    the heom is a set of time - local differential equations for the reduced density matrix of the quantum subsystem , which was originally proposed by tanimura and his co - workers  @xcite .",
    "this numerical treatment includes all the orders of the system - bath interactions and is beyond the usual markovian approximation , the rotating wave approximation and the weak - coupling approximation . in recent years",
    ", the heom approach was successfully used to study the reduced dynamics in many chemical and biophysical systems , such as optical line shapes of molecular aggregates and electron energy transfer dynamics in the fenna - matthews - olson complex  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the heom method is also employed to investigate some important problems in the field of the quantum information science , such as the dynamics of the entanglement or quantum discord in quantum dissipative systems  @xcite , the dynamical behaviors of the spin squeezing and the quantum fisher information under certain non - markovian decoherence channels  @xcite .    during the last years",
    ", there has been an increasing interest to study the memory effect of the bath in quantum dissipative systems  @xcite , this memory effect , which is also known as the non - markovianity , is a very important characteristic of the quantum dissipative dynamics and has many applications in realistic physical systems  @xcite . since the non - markovian bath retains the memory and has some feedback action on the quantum subsystem , the reduced dynamics of the quantum subsystem could be considerably changed .",
    "it would be of great interest in an investigation of the qze and the qaze in a non - markovian bath .",
    "moreover , we are not only interested in the qze or the qaze in the non - markovian bath , but also in the modifications of the qze ( or the qaze ) induced by the non - markovianity .",
    "what is the link between the non - markovianity and the qze ( the qaze ) ? or more specifically , what is the influences of the non - markovianity on the qze or the qaze in quantum dissipative systems ? in this paper , we try to address this question by studying the qze and the qaze of a biased qubit ( and a qutrit ) coupled to a zero temperature non - markovian bosonic bath .    on the other hand , for practical quantum devices",
    ", the influences of bath temperature on the decoherence can not be disregarded .",
    "one commonly believed concept is that the bath temperature can speed up the destruction of quantum coherence .",
    "however , some studies have shown that the bath temperature is able to reduce the decoherence in some quantum dissipative systems  @xcite .",
    "this result is contrary to the common recognition that a higher bath temperature always induces a more severe decoherence and suggests that the bath temperature plays a very intricate role in quantum dissipative systems .",
    "a interesting question arises here , what is the influences of the bath temperature on the qze or the qaze in quantum dissipative systems ? to address the above concern , we also generalize our study to the finite temperature situation .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] , we briefly outline some basic concepts as well as the general formalism of the qze and the qaze in a general quantum dissipative system . in sec .",

    "[ sec : sec4 ] .",
    "in this section , we would like to make a brief summary of the main features of the qze and the qaze in quantum dissipative systems .",
    "the general hamiltonian of a quantum dissipative system can be described by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of the quantum subsystem , @xmath2 denotes the hamiltonian of the surrounding bath and @xmath3 stands for the system - bath interaction hamiltonian . in our work , we regard the quantum subsystem @xmath1 as the object to be measured . throughout , we work in the dimensionless units and @xmath4 . assuming the initial state of the quantum subsystem is @xmath5 and the bath",

    "the effective decay rate @xmath17 is the crucial physical quantity to study the qze and the qaze in quantum dissipative systems  @xcite . in many previous studies ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath18 is used to identify the occurrence of the qze and the qaze , where @xmath19 is the natural decay rate of the quantum subsystem obtained by the fermi golden rule  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt an alternative way to characterize the qze and the qaze  @xcite : the qze takes place when the effective decay rate @xmath17 decreases as @xmath20 becomes smaller , while , the qaze occurs when the effective decay rate @xmath17 increases as @xmath20 becomes smaller .",
    "the local maximum or minimum of @xmath17 is the transition point between the qze regime and the qaze regime .",
    "this definition of qze and qaze has a clear physical picture : if the rapidly repeated measurements decrease the value of effective decay rate , the relaxation rate of the measured system is suppressed which leads to the qze , on the other hand , if the rapidly repeated measurements increase the value of effective decay rate , the relaxation rate of the measured system is accelerated which leads to the qaze . when @xmath21 , neither the qze nor the qaze occurs .",
    "the classification of the qze and the qaze by the behaviors of @xmath17 is very suitable for the case where the natural decay rate is unknown  @xcite .",
    "the other important physical quantity to describe the qze is the quantum zeno time .",

    "one can find that a larger value of @xmath24 makes the qze easier to realize  @xcite .",
    "the dissipation - induced decoherence in a quantum microscopic system can be effectively modeled by the spin - boson model , which describes the interaction between a spin subsystem and a bosonic bath .",
    "the spin - boson model has attracted considerable attention in past decades because it provides a very simple model to simulate many physical and biologic processes .",
    "the reduced system dynamics of the spin - boson model has been studied by various analytical and numerical methods , for example , the generalized silbey - harris transformation approach  @xcite , the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method  @xcite , the dirac - frenkel time - dependent variation with davydov ansatz  @xcite , and the heom formalism  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "second , some studies showed that the finite external bias field is able to enhance the quantum coherence  @xcite , this effect of the nonzero external bias field maybe helpful to realize the qze or the qaze in experiment , because the observation of the qze or the qaze requires a relatively long quantum relaxation or decoherence time  @xcite .    in this subsection",
    ", we assume the bath is initially prepared in its fock - vacuum state @xmath46 and the bath density spectral function @xmath47 has the lorentz spectrum form @xmath48 where @xmath49 defines the spectral width of the coupling and @xmath50 can be approximately interpreted as the system - bath coupling strength .",
    "the reason why we choose the lorentz spectrum at zero temperature case is twofold : firstly , for a lorentzian bath density spectral function @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( see eq .  [ eq : eq17 ] in the appendix ) is the ornstein - uhlenbeck - type bath correlation function  @xcite which is the key point to perform the heom scheme  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the lorentzian spectrum has a clear boundary between markovian and non - markovian regimes  @xcite .",
    "more specifically speaking , the parameter @xmath49 is connected to the bath correlation time @xmath53 by the relation @xmath54 , while the time scale @xmath55 , on which the state of the system changes , is given by @xmath56 . in this sense , the boundary between markovian regimes and non - markovian regimes can be approximately specified by the ratio of @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath58 is very small , which means the bath correlation time @xmath53 is much smaller than the relaxation time of the quantum subsystem @xmath55 , the decoherence mechanics is markovian  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath58 is large , the memory effect of the bath should be taken into account and the dynamics of this open system is then non - markovian  @xcite .",

    "this feature of the lorentz spectrum is very helpful for us to study the relationship between the non - markovianity and the qze in quantum dissipative systems .",
    "however , we also want to point out that a more rigorous way to distinguish the markovian or non - markovian regimes in parameter space should consider not only the bath density spectral function @xmath62 but also the decoherence channel . in recent years",

    "in fact , considering the fact that the trace distance is a measure of distinguishability between two quantum states , this _ lemma _ tells us a very intuitive physical result : a higher ( or lower ) distinguishability between @xmath140 and @xmath144 ( or @xmath142 ) makes the qze easier to realize .",
    "the physical meaning of the trace distance @xmath132 $ ] can be easily understood from the view of the exchange of quantum information  @xcite .",
    "we can define the change rate of the trace distance as @xmath145\\equiv dd[\\hat{\\rho},\\hat{\\varrho}]/dt$ ] .",

    "@xcite , the authors provide a description of the qze and the qaze in quantum dissipative systems without using the wave packet collapse postulation and discuss the effect of the non - demolition measurement on the qze and the qaze .",
    "furthermore , many literatures have shown that the effect of measurement can be replaced by a continuous strong coupling between the to - be - measured system and an auxiliary apparatus  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , neither of these two formalisms is very suitable for a numerical study of the qze and the qaze in quantum dissipative systems , it would be very interesting to numerically explore the qze and the qaze in quantum dissipative systems beyond the wave packet collapse postulation .",
    "the qze ( qaze ) has become a focus of attention not only because of its foundational implications about the quantum mechanics , but also because it may be exploited to explore some potential applications in the quantum control  @xcite , the communication complexity problem  @xcite , and the quantum state protection or preparation  @xcite . to achieve any of the above potential applications ,",
    "the noisy bath can not be ignored .",
    "this is the main reason why we consider the effects of the non - markovian noise and the bath temperature on the qze ( and qaze ) .",
    "our work is a step forward in a physical insight into understanding of the qze and the qaze in quantum dissipative systems .    in conclusion",
    ", we adopt a numerical heom method to investigate the qze and the qaze in quantum dissipative systems .",
    "this numerical approach allows us to study the dynamical behavior of a quantum dissipative system without the usual markovian approximation , the rotating wave approximation and the weak - coupling approximation .",
    "we investigate the effective decay rates of a biased qubit - boson model and a biased qutrit - boson model at both zero and finite temperatures .",
    "the multiple zeno - anti - zeno crossover phenomena are found in these quantum dissipative systems .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the existence of multiple peaks can be significant for experiments , because it allows us to observe the zeno - anti - zeno transition by a relatively large measurement interval .",
    "we also find that the value of the quantum zeno time in a markovian regime is shorter than that of the non - markovian regime .",
    "this result suggests that the non - markovianity of the bath may be favorable for the accessibility of the qze in quantum dissipative systems .",
    "moreover , for the finite temperature case , it is shown that the value of the the quantum zeno time at high bath temperature is shorter than that of the low temperature case .",
    "this result implies that the high bath temperature may add the difficulty in observing the qze in quantum dissipative systems .",

    "<S> we investigate the quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects in quantum dissipative systems by employing a hierarchical equations of motion approach which is beyond the usual markovian approximation , the rotating wave approximation and the weak - coupling approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum zeno and anti - zeno dynamics of a biased qubit - boson model and a biased qutrit - boson model are provided as illustrative examples . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that ( i ) there exists multiple zeno - anti - zeno crossover phenomena ; ( ii ) the non - markovian characteristic of the bath may be favorable for the accessibility of the zeno dynamics ; and ( iii ) high bath temperature may add the difficulty in observing the quantum zeno effect in quantum dissipative systems . </S>"
