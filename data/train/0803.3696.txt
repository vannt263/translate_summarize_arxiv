    "the stability of nuclei , as determined by looking for proton decay @xcite , sets a lower limit also on the lifetime of other processes such as neutron - antineutron ( @xmath6 ) oscillations in free space .",
    "this @xmath7 baryon - violating @xmath6 oscillation process was pointed out long ago in the pioneering papers by kuzmin @xcite , by glashow @xcite and by mohaptra and marshak @xcite .",
    "several quantitative calculations relating the nuclear disappearance lifetime @xmath8 to the @xmath6 oscillation time @xmath9 have been reported @xcite . in these calculations a point - like @xmath6 coupling @xmath10 is assumed . in free space , @xmath11 splits the @xmath12 degenerate mass @xmath13 into mass eigenstates @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath6 oscillations between these two mass eigenstates are suppressed in nuclear matter , giving place to decay of neutrons in a stable nucleus . instead of two mass eigenstates",
    "one encounters two distinct widths , one which is the nuclear @xmath1 annihilation width of order @xmath15  mev for central nuclear densities @xcite , the other one associated with the lifetime of a bound neutron : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the nuclear disappearance width per neutron .",
    "these statements follow , more rigorously , from a discussion of the temporal evolution of nuclear disappearance owing to @xmath6 oscillations @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : supp ] ) demonstrates that @xmath6 oscillations are suppressed in nuclei by 31 orders of magnitude , which is the ratio between the time scales @xmath18  s for the strong - interaction @xmath1 annihilation time @xmath19 and @xmath20  s presumed below for the free - space oscillation time @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to @xmath1 annihilation , neutrons and antineutrons also experience different nuclear potentials @xmath22 and @xmath23 , leading within a closure approximation @xcite to a refinement of eq .",
    "( [ eq : supp ] ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is some appropriately chosen average of ( minus ) the imaginary part of the @xmath1 nuclear potential .    to leading order , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : supp ] ) , the relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath8 is given roughly by @xmath26 the values reported for @xmath8 in the literature , by convention , are normalized per neutron and take into account secondary and absorption processes .",
    "thus , @xmath8 essentially stands for the lifetime of a neutron in a stable nucleus . using the best value @xmath27  yr published by the soudan 2 collaboration @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) gives a lower limit estimate of @xmath28  s. this estimate is to be compared with the lower limit @xmath29  s stated by the soudan 2 collaboration using the calculations made long ago by dover - gal - richard @xcite .",
    "however , this apparent agreement might be fortuitous .",
    "we comment that the lower limit on @xmath9 derived from nuclear disappearance considerations is higher than that determined using nuclear - reactor neutrons directly in searches for @xmath6 oscillations . the lower limit given by the grenoble reactor experiment",
    "@xcite is @xmath30  s.    recently , the super - kamiokande ( sk ) collaboration released an improved value for @xmath8 in oxygen , @xmath31  yr @xcite . in the present work we report an accurate calculation of the lower limit on @xmath9 implied by this value of @xmath32 , using the latest detailed analysis by our group which derived antinucleon nuclear potentials from antiprotonic atom data and radiochemical data @xcite .",
    "these potentials are essentially isoscalar and apply to antineutrons as well as to antiprotons . for completeness , in this study we also calculate the reduced lifetime ( see below ) in iron which will provide the necessary link between a future measurement of @xmath33 and a derivation of a lower limit on @xmath9 .",
    "another experimental method of looking for @xmath6 oscillations is to use ultracold neutrons in a trap , first suggested by chetyrkin _",
    "_ @xcite and discussed since then by several other groups , _",
    "e.g. _ in refs .",
    "@xcite . a necessary input for interpreting such experiments are the nuclear @xmath1 scattering lengths for ultracold antineutrons in matter .",
    "we report here on calculations of @xmath1 scattering lengths for several chosen materials , again based on the analysis of antiprotonic atoms .",
    "the calculated values of these scattering lengths turn out to be largely model independent owing to the strong absorption of low energy antinucleons .",
    "a point - like coupling @xmath10 , representing @xmath6 oscillations in free space , connects each of the stationary bound single - particle ( sp ) neutron states to the corresponding @xmath1 stationary sp state .",
    "the sp energies assume complex values @xmath34 , where the imaginary part of the energy in the sp state labeled @xmath35 gives the disappearance width @xmath36 for this state .",
    "the coupled @xmath37-@xmath1 radial wave equations for the neutron sp wavefunction @xmath38 and the antineutron sp wavefunction @xmath39 are given by    @xmath40    @xmath41~w_{\\nu{\\ell } j}(r)-e_{\\nu{\\ell}j}~w_{\\nu{\\ell}j}(r)+\\delta m~u_{\\nu{\\ell}j}(r)=0~ ,   \\label{eq : nbar}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the nuclear potentials exerted by the nuclear core on the neutrons and antineutrons , respectively , and @xmath44 is the reduced mass .",

    "a useful expression for the width @xmath36 is obtained by multiplying eq .",
