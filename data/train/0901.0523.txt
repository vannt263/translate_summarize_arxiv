    "since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity @xcite we learned that low dimensional structures are good candidates for high critical superconducting temperature @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "related to this dimensionality effect it appears appropriate to mention also the role played by two dimensional ( 2d ) interfaces in triggering superconductivity in nominally non - superconducting environment @xcite .",
    "one of the main paradigms for 2d carrier systems , graphene as well as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) or multigraphene have attracted considerable attention recently , partially due to the possibility of regulating the carrier density @xmath0 by the field effect @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "hints for the existence of superconductivity in hopg have been published in the last years @xcite .",
    "let us first point out some interesting aspects of multigraphene that should play a role in triggering the superconductivity phenomenon .",
    "whereas graphene should be nominally a 2d system , multigraphene or hopg is a quasi-2d system due to the weak coupling between graphene layers , which is the reason for the huge anisotropy in resistivity , for example @xcite .",
    "both materials , graphene as well as hopg have high energetic phonons going up to @xmath7  ev with many other branches at lower energies @xcite .",
    "high energy phonons due to small element mass provide an excellent condition for superconductivity as in the case of metallic h at high pressures @xcite . from this point of view",
    "it seems reasonable to look for superconductivity in these materials taking into account the whole phonon spectral function weighted by the electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "for hopg it has been recently shown that upon temperature ( and defect concentration ) @xmath8@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite the lowest value obtained in clean samples and at low temperatures is clearly smaller than in free - standing as well as fixed - on - substrate graphene samples . to achieve a clear increase in the carrier density the case of attached hydrogen in hopg",
    "is of special interest . according to theoretical results upon the amount and the way hydrogen",
    "is attached to a graphene layer , a semiconducting , metallic or even a magnetically orderer state appears @xcite . in case of metallization",
    "the electron density may increase dramatically in the region near hydrogen , e.g. 0.1 to 1 electron per unit cell . added to this effect , the effective mass increases from the usual very small values @xmath9 to nearly the free electron mass @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "note that in this case no dirac dispersion relation is valid for graphite carriers but the usual quadratic one , dispersion that we will assume through all this work .",
    "the hydrogen - graphene bound system is interesting due to the influence in the spectral density similarly to the case of superconductivity in aromatic molecules @xcite .    on the other hand , we know that the reaction of hydrogen adsorbed on carbon is endothermic and difficult to realize .",
    "however , experimental results indicate large amounts of hydrogen is present in hopg samples @xcite .",
    "hydrogen in hopg might be included through the synthesis of this material , obtained after high - pressure and high - temperature treatment of polymers ( e.g. kapton ) foils .",
    "we expect therefore hydrogen can be bounded to carbon , specially around vacancies and other defects , or at the interfaces conforming regions or pockets with different electron densities .",
    "hydrogen bounded at defects might be the origin for the ferromagnetic properties @xcite , the anomalous transport observed in hopg in the last years @xcite and for the existence of non - homogeneous , granular - like superconductivity @xcite , possible at the interfaces between highly crystalline graphite regions in hopg samples @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to calculate the superconducting energy gap at @xmath11  k for a graphene layer and extend this result to the anisotropic graphite case . following the mermin - wagner theorem in a pure 2d system",
    "there is no superconductivity @xcite and therefore the problem should be treated as a beresinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition @xcite . in the anisotropic case the problem is solved having a small anisotropy @xmath12 , which resembles the low coupling between graphene layers in graphite . as in the 2d anisotropic heisenberg model ,",
    "no matter how small is @xmath12 , one has an appreciable critical temperature because of the logarithmic behavior of the thermal fluctuation influence @xcite .",
    "the results of this work indicate that hydrogen could play a decisive role triggering high temperature superconductivity in graphite .",
    "the estimate of the critical temperature @xmath6 using bcs is done from the energy gap equation given by @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density of states at the fermi energy @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the interaction potential that we split into the electron - phonon term and the coulomb potential , this last taken as a constant for a given carrier density .",
    "the potential @xmath17 depends on the pair - interaction - assisted phonon energy @xmath18 .",
    "both potentials will be estimated below .",
    "finally the fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath19 at a given @xmath20 that we set at @xmath6 .    at high metallic densities",
    "@xmath21 ( this last the debye energy ) @xmath6 is estimated assuming that electron pairs are formed with an energy difference up to @xmath22 around @xmath15 .",
    "then , the well known equation for the zero temperature energy gap ( weak coupling limit ) @xcite @xmath23 is obtained with @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 where the @xmath27 means the average within @xmath15 or @xmath22 and the screening length of the corresponding potentials . the well known result ( [ delta2 ] )",
    "is obtained solving eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) by introducing cutoffs energies for electrons and phonons . using an einstein approximation morel and",
    "anderson obtained the same results for @xmath28 and @xmath29 without introducing cutoffs @xcite .",
    "the results remain the same for a 2d system but due to the bkt phase transition it is valid only at @xmath30k .",
    "we discuss now the differences between 2d and 3d .",
    "we express all the necessary quantities as a function of @xmath32 , the distance between the carriers in units of the bohr radius .",
    "the quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the 3d values for the fermi vector and the inverse of the thomas - fermi decay length .",
    "analogously for 2d we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "notice that the inverse decay length in 2d does not depend on the density @xmath37 .",
    "another important difference is in the coulomb interaction that behaves as @xmath38 for 3d and @xmath39 for 2d , where @xmath40 is the wave vector .",
    "these potentials should be reliable for @xmath41 above which pines @xcite noted that convergence problems in the estimates may occur .",
    "note that the value @xmath42 is still smaller than those needed for the wigner crystal formation @xcite .    in the 3d case",
    "the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in eqs .",
    "( [ delta2 ] ) and ( [ mu1 ] ) are given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the eqs .",
    "( 6,7 ) correspond exactly to eqs .",
    "( 46,44 ) from ref .  .",
    "note that our eq .",
    "( 7 ) is the average angular value of eq .  ( 26 ) of ref .   that missed a factor @xmath47 in the corresponding eq .",
    "( 44 ) . for the case of",
    "2d we have @xmath44 as the average angular of the coulomb potential @xmath48 and @xmath43 is calculated as the average angular value of the square coulomb potential multiplied by @xmath49 because of averaging the @xmath50moment .",
    "therefore we have @xmath51 now we are prepared to estimate the values of @xmath31 in 2d and 3d for different values of @xmath32 , a function of the electronic density .",
    "it should be notice that @xmath43 and @xmath44 obtained as defined previously agree with the values obtained by morel and anderson @xcite .",
    "they obtained them including an einstein effective frequency as approximation for the phonon structure . within a debye model",
    "similar equations are obtained but the phonon contribution is taken as an average on the whole phonon spectra .",
    "k vs. the distance between carriers @xmath32 in units of bohr radius @xmath52 for the 3d case and for the effective masses @xmath53 of the free electron mass ( continuous , dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) .",
    "the curves were obtained using eqs .",
    "( [ delta2],3,4,6,7 ) and the parameter @xmath54[k ] as an average over all frequencies.,width=332 ]    we found that @xmath31 is in general about @xmath55 times larger in 2d than in 3d at similar values of @xmath32 . in fig .  1 we present @xmath31 vs. @xmath32 for the 3d case for 3 values of @xmath1 corresponding to 0.1 , 1 and 3 the free electron mass .",
    "figure 2 shows the results for the 2d case . what can be the physical reasons for having energy gaps much larger in 2d than in 3d ?",
    "they are related to the different weights and values of the ratios @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the averaged maximum phonon wave vector ) .",
    "their contributions in 2d are dominant and depend on the effective mass , as seen in fig .  3 where we plot the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with @xmath59@xmath60 for 2d ( as in 3d ) .",
    "note that the differences in @xmath31 between the 2d and 3d cases are larger the smaller the effective mass @xmath1 .",
    "( dashed - dotted line ) and @xmath57 for the 2d case for the three different effective masses 3 , 1 and 0.1 of the free electron mass ( continuous , dashed and dotted lines).,width=332 ]    it is adequate to study quasi 2d problems with a degree of anisotropy provided by the ratio between the conductance in the atomic lattice plane and perpendicular to it , i.e. @xmath61 . for example , in the case of hopg we have an in - plane conductance @xmath62 than the conductance perpendicular to the plane . as in the case of the heisenberg model in 2d with anisotropy ,",
    "even if it is small , this is very effective to recover again the superconducting phase transition at @xmath63k by a logarithmic function of this anisotropy , i.e. @xmath64 for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the elliptic function @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy produces a variation of @xmath6 of @xmath67 of the value obtained from the simple estimate using the bcs result @xmath68 .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath31 remains a good approximation for the anisotropic quasi 2d case .",
    "we performed first calculations for hopg at relatively low densities .",
    "we note that in graphene as well as in hopg the expected @xmath6 is negligible small at electron densities @xmath69@xmath4 .",
    "according to the bcs approach and our estimates neither materials can be superconductors at those electron densities . however , for the electron densities obtained for the case of hydrogen fixed in special ( e.g. stone - wales ) defects we have @xmath70@xmath4 with a metallic - like band character that crosses the fermi level with @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the estimated critical temperatures for these densities are around 25  k , values comparable to the observations in multigraphene samples @xcite .",
    "note that decreasing @xmath0 by a factor of two increases @xmath6 approximately by a similar factor , see fig .  2 . according to our estimate , a further decrease of @xmath0",
    ", however , would produce a decrease of the critical temperature , see fig .  2 .",
    "although defects in the graphene / graphite structure would increase the carrier density in a first stage , we believe that attached hydrogen may be the most probable reason for the local increase of @xmath0 .",
    "the idea that hydrogen may trigger superconductivity in graphite due to the large increase in the electron density provides also a way to understand several experimental facts that we summarize below . experimental results from squid @xcite and magnetotransport @xcite indicate that the possible superconducting state in hopg has granular character : neither percolation in transport nor meissner effect are observed so far for samples larger than @xmath72 m .",
    "irreversibilities in the magnetotransport of mesoscopic multigraphene samples @xcite are compatible with the existence of superconducting patches connected by semiconductor regions , similar to those irreversibilities observed in granular high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "transport measurements at different regions of the same micrometer small and a few tens of nanometers thick multigraphene samples reveal an inhomogeneous behavior compatible with the existence of metallic- and semiconductor - like regions @xcite .",
    "compatible with this view of hopg , electric field force microscopy ( efm ) measurements on its surface indicate the existence of large variations in the electronic potential providing a clear hint that hopg is an inhomogeneous electronic system @xcite .",
    "a recently done correlation between the thickness dependence of the resistivity and magnetotransport with the internal microstructure of hopg suggests that the internal interfaces between crystalline graphite regions are the regions where superconductivity can be located @xcite .",
    "these interfaces may have enough hydrogen trapped to increase the electronic density , triggering superconductivity in different regions with different critical temperatures , keeping the quasi - two dimensionality in agreement with the large anisotropy observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "we should mention other approaches that deal with superconductivity in graphene and graphite . starting with graphene",
    "@xcite we would like to note that for a carrier density @xmath73@xmath4 the critical temperature @xmath74k .",
    "therefore , one needs to increase drastically the electron concentration in order to have a @xmath6 in the few kelvin range .",
    "another publication @xcite obtains very large numbers for @xmath6 in graphite .",
    "the basis of this result is to add certain atoms to graphite , in particular sulfur .",
    "the attractive interactions between electrons are based in electronic correlations effects .",
    "it is basically the same type of approach that we use but with phonons .",
    "it is clear that to produce superconductivity in graphite one has to incorporate a material into its planes to reise the carrier density to @xmath75@xmath4 .",
    "otherwise we find that no appreciable superconductivity can be expected in graphite within the mean field approach .",
    "in conclusion , the superconducting - like behavior observed in bulk hopg as well as in mesoscopic multigraphene samples could be explained applying the known techniques within the bcs approach and calculating @xmath31 for the quasi-2d problem . from our results",
    "we expect clear variations of @xmath6 with the electronic density , indicating that neither perfect hopg nor perfect graphene could be superconducting .",
    "we have presented results that indicate a huge increase in @xmath6 for the 2d case with respect to the 3d for the same set of parameters .",
    "this is due to the behavior of @xmath76 and @xmath77 providing much higher values for @xmath31 in the 2d case .",
    "we have applied the bcs approach to the system graphene - hydrogen and have found that @xmath78k are possible with reasonable electronic densities . upon",
    "effective mass and electronic density , high critical temperatures in hopg - hydrogen system may be realized and therefore the problem of superconductivity in graphite should be taken with more attention .",
