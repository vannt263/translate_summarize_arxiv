    "<S> maximum classical mutual information is called classical correlation which represents the difference in von neumann entropy before and after the measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similarly defined quantity is the holevo bound which measures the capacity of quantum states for classical communication@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the holevo bound is an exceedingly useful upper bound on the accessible information that plays an important role in many applications of quantum information theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is a keystone in the proof of many results in quantum information theory@xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    the maximal holevo quantity and classical correlation are both classical and based on von neumann measurements . due to the fundamental role of weak measurements , it is interesting to know how those classical correlations will be if weak measurements are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it is shown that weak measurements performed on one of the subsystems can lead to `` super quantum discord '' which is always larger than the normal quantum discord captured by projective measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask whether weak measurements can also capture more classical correlations . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we shall give the definition of `` super classical correlation '' by weak measurements as the generalization of classical correlation defined for standard projective measurements . </S>",
    "<S> as the generalization of the maximal holevo quantity defined for projective measurements , we propose `` weak maximal holevo quantity '' according weak measurements . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , by tuning continuously from strong measurements to weak measurements , the discrepancy between the weak maximal holevo quantity and the maximal holevo quantity becomes larger . </S>",
    "<S> such phenomenon also exits between super classical correlation and classical correlation . in comparison with super quantum discord which is larger than the standard discord , </S>",
    "<S> the weak maximal holevo quantity and super classical correlation becomes less when weak measurements are applied , while they are completely the same for projective measurements . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , weak measurements do not capture more classical correlations . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the specified measure of correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the maximal holevo quantity for bell - diagonal states , and compare the results with classical correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we give super classical correlation and weak maximal holevo quantity for bell - diagonal states and compare the relations among super quantum correlations , quantum correlations , classical correlation and super classical correlation and entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic behavior of weak maximal holevo quantity under decoherence is also investigated . </S>"
