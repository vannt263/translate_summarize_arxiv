    "flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in general , and of the top quark in particular , play an important role as a testing ground for the standard model ( sm ) and for new physics ( np ) .",
    "because of its large mass , the top quark can decay into all other quarks , accompanied by gauge or higgs bosons , as well as into new particles predicted by np models .",
    "the interest in fcnc for top quark physics stems from the facts that :    1 .",
    "the scale of np is closer to the top quark mass more than to any other quark .",
    "2 .   in the sm ,",
    "the fcnc two - body processes @xmath3 are absent at tree- level and are highly suppressed by the gim mechanism at one loop .",
    "their branching ratios predicted in the sm are of the order of @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xcite , far away from present and even future reaches of either the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite or the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    "there are many models of np in which the branching ratios for the above 2-body fcnc decays are much larger than those obtained in the sm ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to the two - body rare decays of top quark , some of its rare three - body decays e.g. , @xmath6 have been considered in the literature within the sm @xcite and for np @xcite .",
    "these three body decays are suppressed with respect to two - body decays in the sm but some of them get comparably large within models of np , such as two - higgs - doublet @xcite , especially after including finite - width effects @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze another three - body rare decay , namely @xmath7 within the sm framework and compare it to both @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the main motivation for such a calculation comes from the phenomenon in which higher order dominates over a lower order rate , as observed in the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and in other systems .    for the case of charm",
    "decays , the short distance contribution to @xmath12 , exhibits a huge enhancement over the lowest order penguin diagrams @xcite .",
    "one can argue then that even higher order short distance are not that important .",
    "unfortunately for radiative @xmath13 decays , even this enhancement is overshadowed by much larger long distance terms .",
    "for @xmath11-quark decays , a study of the next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) qcd corrections @xcite , yielded @xmath14 , whereas the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) result @xmath15 , in spite of an @xmath16 suppression .",
    "this large correction is dynamical in nature , since it is due to a large ratio of wilson coefficients evaluated at @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( for earlier references see ) , higher order dominance may also become substantial in the decays of a sequential fourth generation quark @xmath19 , if it exists .",
    "more recently @xcite , the one - loop , three - body , rare top quark decay @xmath20 , where @xmath21 was calculated in the sm and found to dominate over the one - loop , two - body , rare @xmath22 decay , by about one order of magnitude , although the latter is of lower order in @xmath23 .",
    "later on , we will comment about their result .",
    "the purpose of this article is to evaluate and discuss the higher order dominance issue in rare top decays among @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the present calculations are within the sm and while , as discussed above , @xmath8 and @xmath26 were calculated before , this is the first calculation of @xmath7 in the sm .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the calculation of @xmath7 , in section iii the decay @xmath26 is evaluated , and in section iv we conclude .",
    "the appendix includes the one - loop functions which appear in section ii .",
    "the one - loop @xmath27 and , in general , the @xmath28 vertex function can be expressed , using lorentz and gauge invariance , as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are assumed .",
    "the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are called _ charge - radius _ ( or _ monopolar _ ) and _ dipole moment _ ( or _ dipolar _ ) form factor , respectively .",
    "note that this is not the most general vertex function .",
    "there are two more form factors , namely @xmath34 ( right - handed monopolar ) and @xmath35 ( left - handed dipolar ) , which are both proportional to @xmath36 so that for the sake of simplicity we omit them here ( see @xcite for the details ) . in our numerical analyses , however , all contributions are retained .    while @xmath37 contribution to @xmath38 ( i.e. for a real gluon ) vanishes , both @xmath37 and @xmath39 give non - zero contribution to @xmath40 and to @xmath41 .",
    "of course , the vertex functions @xmath42 for the three - body processes are more complicated than just @xmath43 above , but if @xmath44 , there is a chance that the three - body modes will be of the same order , or even larger than @xmath8 .    in the sm ,",
    "the decay @xmath7 occurs at one - loop level and the feynman diagrams contributing to the decay are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcgg ] in the t hooft - feynman gauge ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the @xmath46 field in the diagrams is the unphysical part of the higgs field .",
    "the polarization sum of the gluons is naively @xmath47 however , it is well known @xcite that in cases where there are two or more external gluons ( either for tree , like @xmath48 , or for loop diagrams as in the present case ) , the above sum leads to violation of gauge invariance .",
    "the problem is alleviated either by choosing a transverse polarization sum , or by introducing ghost fields to get rid of the unphysical gluon polarizations while keeping the simple polarization sum above .",
    "the ghost contributions are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tcggghost ] .    fig .",
    "[ fig : tcggghost ] requires some explanation .",
    "the ghosts couple only to a gluon , i.e. there is a @xmath49ghost  ghost coupling but there is no coupling to quarks .",
    "therefore , there is a ghost anti - ghost diagram for each diagram with a triple gluon coupling .",
    "furthermore , since the ghost is not its anti - particle there are six diagrams with ghosts as in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcggghost ] and there is no statistical factor after phase - space integration , unlike the case of two final gluons where a statistical factor of @xmath50 is inserted following phase space integration . note also that there are no interference terms between ghost and ghostless amplitudes .    in our calculation",
    "we make the gim mechanism manifest by dropping terms independent of internal quark mass .",
    "this will substantially simplify the calculation .",
    "the divergent parts originate only from the unphysical higgs loops .",
    "as the cancellation of ultraviolet divergences should happen at the amplitude squared level for @xmath7 in the t hooft - feynman gauge , the analytical output is so long that the ultraviolet finiteness has to be checked numerically .",
    "we carried out the calculation in @xmath13-dimension using dimensional regularization @xcite and keep the decay width formulas as functions of @xmath51 .",
    "then we check the stability of the decay width by varying @xmath52 . of course ,",
    "this method is limited by the achievable numerical precision of the program used .",
    "we have done our calculation with the softwares feynarts and formcalc @xcite and done some partial cross - checks with feyncalc @xcite . with formcalc",
    "the numerical check of ultraviolet finiteness is controlled by a parameter and thus easier to check .",
    "we have tested and confirmed the finiteness of our results for @xmath7 ( as well as for @xmath9 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "in addition to ultraviolet divergences , we must deal with infrared and collinear divergences which exist in the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "there are three possible cases producing such singularities : a ) the configuration of having one of the gluons travel parallel to the charm quark , b ) the configuration of having the gluons traveling parallel to each other , or c ) the fact that one of the gluons in the final state could be soft .",
    "while cases a ) and b ) are related collinear divergence , case c ) is related to the infrared singularity . to cure case a ) we take a non - zero mass for the charm quark in our numerical calculation even though we present some of our analytical results in the @xmath31 limit , just for simplicity .",
    "there are two ways to approach cases b ) and c ) .",
    "one can either do an extensive study by including qcd corrections consistently of the same order in the perturbation theory , this case up to the order of @xmath53 requires including the interference terms from two - loop @xmath8 ( one - loop qcd corrections ) with one - loop @xmath0 ; or one can exclude the part of the phase space containing singular points by simply imposing cuts on the kinematics of the process . the former method can be achieved by dimensionally regularizing the phase space integrals with @xmath54 and making the divergence manifest",
    ". then the cancellation of infrared singularities is guaranteed by the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorem @xcite .",
    "basically one has to carry out a study for top quark decays similar to the @xmath55 evaluation done by greub and liniger@xcite .",
    "we chose to proceed by cutting the `` dangerous '' integration limits as discussed below .",
    "our calculation is therefore more in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "when we carry out integration over phase space by using the momentum delta functions and azimuthal symmetry , we are left with only two non - trivial integration over variables , say , the energy of one of the gluons ( @xmath56 ) and the energy of the @xmath10-quark ( @xmath57 ) , where the energies are in rest frame of the decaying top quark .",
    "then in ( @xmath58 ) space , the region of integration becomes a triangular shape .",
    "the singularities discussed above lie at the boundaries of the region , infrared singularities at the vertices and collinear singularities along the boundary lines .",
    "thus we have to impose cuts on both @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we will discuss this point further later in the section .",
    "note that since we constrain our phase space , our result for @xmath61 should be seen as approximate and more conservative .",
    "let us now present some analytical expressions . for the sake of simplicity of the presentation , the masses @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath63 are assumed to be zero , though we included their contributions in our numerical study . from figs .",

    "however , the branching ratio for the @xmath7 channel in the sm , is still too small to be observable in any conceivable experiment .",
    "thus any experimental sighting of @xmath7 will indicate the appearance of np .",
    "the three - body decay @xmath7 has another important difference with respect to @xmath1 : a promising ratio for @xmath7 might lead to a sizable cross section for single top production via @xmath87 at a future hadron collider , especially since most of the interesting events will be fed by partonic sub - processes originating from gluon - gluon collisions .",
    "we are currently investigating the decay @xmath7 and the effect of its crossed partonic sub - process @xmath88 on single top production at the lhc , within the minimal supersymmetric sm @xcite .",
