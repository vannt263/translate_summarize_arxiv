    "precision measurement of the top quark mass , @xmath4 , places constraints on the masses to which the top quark contributes radiative corrections , including the yet unobserved higgs boson , as well as helps place constraints on the masses of particles in extensions to the standard model .    at present , the fermilab tevatron , a @xmath3 collider with @xmath5  tev , is the only accelerator capable of producing top quarks for study , where they are primarily produced in pairs and decay nearly 100% of the time as @xmath6 . the decay of the two @xmath7 bosons determines the decay channel of the @xmath8 system .",
    "while the most precise measurements of @xmath4 are made using the lepton+jets channel ( @xmath9 ) significant contributions to the overall knowledge of @xmath4 are made with measurements in the dilepton ( @xmath0 ) and alljets ( @xmath1 ) channels .",
    "in addition , these decay channels offer unique experimental challenges not present in the lepton+jets channel .",
    "we discuss several recent measurements of the top quark mass in the dilepton channel from both cdf and d0 as well as measurements in the alljets channel from cdf .",
    "these measurements use 2.0 - 2.8 fb@xmath2 of run ii collider data .",
    "two broad strategies are utilized in measuring @xmath4 .",
    "matrix element ( me ) techniques use leading - order matrix element calculations convoluted with detector resolution functions to estimate per - event probabilities for an assumed @xmath4 .",
    "similar probabilities can be calculated for dominant background processes to reduce the impact of background - like events in the final sample .",
    "these per - event probabilities for the entire data sample are then combined to extract the most probable value of @xmath4 .",
    "cdf and d0 both utilize me methods to measure @xmath4 in the dilepton channel .",
    "template - based methods reconstruct a single mass for each event .",
    "templates of reconstructed mass are then formed using monte carlo ( mc ) simulated events in both signal and background .",
    "the distribution of reconstructed masses in the data sample is then compared to these templates to extract a most probable value of @xmath4 .",
    "cdf and d0 both utilize template - based methods to measure @xmath4 in the dilepton mass .",
    "cdf also uses a template - based method to measure @xmath4 in the alljets channel .",
    "additionally , cdf uses a method that combines features of both me and template - based analyses , known as the ideogram method , to measure @xmath4 in the alljets channel .",
    "the dilepton decay channel consists of @xmath8 events where both @xmath7 bosons decay to a charged lepton and neutrino .",
    "this decay channel has the smallest branching ratio of @xmath8 decay channels , approximately 5% the final state in dilepton events consists of two charged leptons ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) , two energetic jets resulting from the @xmath12 quarks , and large missing transverse energy ( @xmath13 ) from the two neutrinos .",
    "as there are two neutrinos and only one measurement of @xmath13 , the dilepton channel is kinematically under - constrained and at least one variable must be integrated over in order to reconstruct an event mass .",
    "the dilepton channel is , however , largely free of qcd background that is present in other @xmath8 decay channels .",
    "the remaining background largely consists of drell - yan ( @xmath14 ) , diboson ( @xmath15 ) and instrumental background where an object is incorrectly reconstructed as a lepton .",
    "both cdf and d0 have employed cut - based event selections for measurements in the dilepton decay channel .",
    "two broad strategies employed for cut - based selections are using two well identified leptons in the final state , or looking for one identified lepton and one isolated track .",
    "the former yields better signal purity but lower statistics while the latter allows more statistics at the expense of more background .",
    "a third strategy employed by cdf is to optimize an event selection specifically for precision in @xmath4 measurement .",
    "this is accomplished by the usage of neuroevolution . beginning with a population of random neural networks ,",
    "@xmath4 measurement precision is evaluated for each network .",
    "poor performers are culled and strong performers are bred together and mutated in successive generations until performance reaches a plateau .",
    "the resulting best - performing network is used as the basis of the final event selection .",
    "this approach results in an increase in signal yield at the expense of a large increase in well - identifiable backgrounds .",
    "event yields for examples of all 3 selection approaches are provided in table  [ tab : selection ] .",
    ".event yields for lepton+isolated track event selection , two identified leptons , and evolutionary neural network .",
    "the d0 selection shown is only in the @xmath16 final state .",
    "additionally , d0 also utilizes a lepton+isolated track selection ( not shown in table ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        9 t. aaltonen _ et .",
