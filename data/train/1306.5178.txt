    "the atmospheric compositions of these intriguing worlds could be widely diverse , ranging from the more familiar hydrogen - dominated ice - giant atmospheres , like our own uranus and neptune , to relatively hydrogen - poor @xmath7- , @xmath2- , or n@xmath1-dominated atmospheres , or to even more exotic hot metallic , oxygen , and sio - dominated atmospheres , depending on the planet s mass , effective temperature , formation history , atmospheric evolution , orbital parameters , and irradiation environment @xcite .",

    "our focus is on how atmospheric properties like temperature , metallicity , and bulk elemental ratios can affect the predicted equilibrium and disequilibrium composition of the atmospheres of generic hot - neptune exoplanets , as well as specific hot neptunes such as gj  436b , for which eclipse observations suggest an unexpected and puzzling atmospheric composition @xcite .",
    "the discovery of gj 436b by the radial - velocity technique ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , followed by its identification as a transiting planet @xcite , confirmed this intriguing object as the first neptune - sized exoplanet ever detected .",

    "the planet s relatively large radius in relation to its mass suggests that gj 436b , like neptune , can not be a purely rocky body or ocean world but must contain a non - negligible component of light gases like hydrogen and helium in an outer atmospheric envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "_ spitzer_/irac transit depths appear to vary with time , which despite the relatively old and apparently quiet nature of the host star , could be due to the occultation of star spots or other regions of non - uniform brightness on the star s surface as the planet transits across the disk .",

    "in particular , the very large flux in the 3.6-@xmath19 m irac bandpass in combination with the negligible flux in the 4.5-@xmath19 m bandpass suggest that co and potentially co@xmath1 are much more abundant than ch@xmath4 in the atmosphere of gj 436b ( @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite for a contrary viewpoint ) , in contrast to theoretical models that predict that @xmath20 and @xmath2 will be the dominant carbon and oxygen constituents . if ch@xmath4 were the dominant carbon - bearing species under gj 436b photospheric conditions , as thermochemical - equilibrium models for solar - like compositions suggest ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , @xcite demonstrate that for assumed atmospheric metallicities up to 50@xmath0 solar , photochemistry does not effectively remove ch@xmath4 from the gj 436b s photosphere , and transport - induced quenching in combination with photochemistry can not explain the large inferred co abundance on gj 436b .",
    "how then can the puzzling secondary - eclipse observations be explained ?",
    "we suggest that other bulk properties of the atmosphere , such as a very high metallicity or non - solar elemental compositions , could potentially resolve the current discrepancies between models and the secondary - eclipse observations of gj 436b . as the atmospheric metallicity",
    "is increased in a planet with gj 436b s effective temperature , the overall hydrogen mole fraction is decreased , and species like co and co@xmath1 that do not contain hydrogen become progressively favored over hydrogen - containing species like @xmath2 and @xmath20 . similarly , as the c / o ratio is decreased , ch@xmath4 becomes progressively less important in relation to co and co@xmath1 as a major carbon - bearing constituent @xcite .",
    "we note that high - metallicity atmospheres are not unexpected for neptune - mass planets ( see section 3.1 below ) .",
    "in fact , in our own solar system , neptune s atmosphere is observed to have a c / h ratio of 40 - 120@xmath0 solar @xcite and is estimated to have an o / h ratio greater than 400@xmath0 solar @xcite .",

    "we also explore how bulk properties like atmospheric temperature , metallicity , and the c / o ratio can affect the predicted composition of more generic hot neptunes , leading to potentially widely diverse spectral properties for such planets .",

    "only species containing the elements h , he , c , n , and o are considered in the kinetics / transport model due to a lack of key rate - coefficient data for species containing the other elements .",
    "note that the included elements are the dominant ones that will not be sequestered within condensates in the atmosphere of gj 436b , and thus the gj 436b results for the major gas - phase species are not expected to change significantly with the inclusion of additional elements .",
    "the thermodynamic principle of microscopic reversibility , which is expected to be accurate even for complex multiple - potential - well chemical reactions @xcite , is assumed in the kinetics / transport model .",
    "chemical equilibrium is achieved kinetically in the deepest , hottest regions of these models , but chemical reactions tend to be slower in the upper , cooler regions .",

    "[ figtemp ] .",
    "for all the non - solar - metallicity thermal models , solar ratios of elements other than hydrogen and helium are scaled by a constant factor . in certain instances ,",
    "we also adopt thermal profiles from @xcite that provide a good fit to the @xcite gj 436b secondary - eclipse data , or we adopt profiles derived from new retrievals such as are described in @xcite ( see also section  [ sectretrieve ] ) .",
    "we typically extend the thermal profiles upward in altitude nearly isothermally to a pressure of 10@xmath30 bar , where all major uv absorbers are optically thin , and downward assuming an adiabat to a lower boundary that reaches at least 2400 k , to ensure that the @xmath22@xmath29 quench levels are contained within the models ( i.e. , to encompass the pressure at which kinetic interconversion between n@xmath1 and nh@xmath23 slows down enough to prevent equilibrium from being maintained , see @xcite ) .",
    "the adopted thermal profiles will be clearly described when we discuss the different gj 436b models .    although the thermal profiles derived from the 3-d gcm and the 1-d phoenix models have some notable differences for any given metallicity ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ figtemp ] ) , both models predict a general upward vertical shift in the thermal profile as the metallicity is increased above solar .",
    "an increased metallicity results in increased mole fractions of opacity sources like water and other key molecular absorbers at lower pressures , which moves the optical - depth unity level ( and `` photosphere '' in general ) upwards to higher altitudes . however , because the overall atmospheric number density decreases with increasing altitude , there is a limit to how high the photosphere can be shifted upwards in altitude from this increased metallicity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because optical thickness can not be approached at very high altitudes . as an example , the phoenix - based models show virtually no differences in the thermal profiles between 1000@xmath0 and 10,000@xmath0 solar metallicities .",
    "the chemical equilibrium ch@xmath4-co equal - abundance boundary also shifts downwards in altitude with increasing metallicity ( see fig .  [ figtemp ] ) .",
    "these two metallicity - dependent effects , first noted by @xcite and discussed in relation to gj 436b by @xcite , motivate our investigation and demonstrate why higher - metallicity models are more likely to explain the inferred large co / ch@xmath4 ratio needed to reproduce the secondary - eclipse data from gj 436b @xcite .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ figtemp ] illustrates that the thermal profile for the 1@xmath0 solar metallicity model lies completely within the ch@xmath4-dominated regime , so that no matter what the rate of vertical mixing or at what pressure the co quenches , the carbon monoxide mole fraction will never exceed the ch@xmath4 mole fraction for this solar - metallicity thermal profile . because the dayside atmosphere is expected to be hotter than the terminators , the likelihood of having co dominate at conditions relevant to the transit",
    "is even smaller if the atmosphere has a solar - like metallicity .",
    "in contrast , the thermal structure of the 1000@xmath0 solar model shown in fig .",
    "[ figtemp ] lies completely within the co - dominated regime , down to at least the 30-bar level .",
    "since the co - ch@xmath4 quench point ( i.e. , where transport processes dominate over the chemical - kinetic interconversion of co and ch@xmath4 ) is likely to be within the @xmath180.1 - 30 bar region on gj 436b @xcite , the quenching will occur in the co - dominated regime for the 1000@xmath0 solar metallicity model , and carbon monoxide will dominate over methane .    in general , the hotter the photosphere of gj 436b , the more abundant co is likely to be .",
    "aside from the effect of increased metallicities , hotter photospheres can result from the addition of tidal heating or a large residual internal heat source .",
    "gj 436 is a relatively quiet star and slow rotator @xcite , suggesting that the system is relatively old ( e.g. , 6@xmath31 gyr , according to @xcite ) . for an older planet of gj 436b s mass ,",

[ figtemp ] above ) ; however , the other assumptions are less secure , and given that the secondary eclipse data show evidence for molecular absorbers rather than a blackbody atmosphere , it seems likely that at least some heavy elements are mixed into the outer atmospheric envelope .",

    "either our theoretical understanding is incomplete , and we are missing some key disequilibrium mechanisms that convert @xmath20 and @xmath2 permanently to co in gj 436b s dayside atmosphere , or the retrieved solutions simply reflect some of the pitfalls that arise when applying retrieval methods to sparse data sets with large systematic uncertainties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> neptune - sized extrasolar planets that orbit relatively close to their host stars  often called `` hot neptunes ''  are common within the known population of exoplanets and planetary candidates . similar to our own uranus and neptune , inefficient accretion of nebular gas </S>",
    "<S> is expected produce hot neptunes whose masses are dominated by elements heavier than hydrogen and helium . at high atmospheric metallicities of 1010,000@xmath0 solar , hot neptunes will exhibit an interesting continuum of atmospheric compositions , ranging from more neptune - like , h@xmath1-dominated atmospheres to more venus - like , co@xmath1-dominated atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the predicted equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry of generic hot neptunes and find that the atmospheric composition varies strongly as a function of temperature and bulk atmospheric properties such as metallicity and the c / o ratio . </S>",
    "<S> relatively exotic @xmath2 , co , co@xmath1 , and even @xmath3-dominated atmospheres are possible for hot neptunes . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our models to the case of gj 436b , where we find that a co - rich , ch@xmath4-poor atmosphere can be a natural consequence of a very high atmospheric metallicity . from comparisons of our results with _ spitzer _ </S>",
    "<S> eclipse data for gj 436b , we conclude that although the spectral fit from the high - metallicity forward models is not quite as good as the fit obtained from pure retrieval methods , the atmospheric composition predicted by these forward models is more physically and chemically plausible . </S>",
    "<S> high - metallicity atmospheres ( orders of magnitude in excess of solar ) should therefore be considered as a possibility for gj 436b and other hot neptunes .    0 </S>",
