    "the constantly accumulating observational data @xcite continue to confirm that the universe has entered the phase of an accelerated expansion after the matter - dominated epoch . to reveal the origin of dark energy ( de ) responsible for this late - time acceleration is one of the most serious stumbling block in modern cosmology @xcite .",
    "the first step toward understanding the nature of de is to find a signature whether it originates from some modification of gravity or it comes from some exotic matter with negative pressure .",
    "if gravity is modified from einstein s general relativity , this leaves a number of interesting experimental and observational signatures that can be tested .",

    "local gravity experiments are carried out , the scalaron field @xmath17 needs to be almost frozen @xcite with a large mass through a chameleon mechanism @xcite to avoid that the field mediates a long ranged fifth force .",

    "in fact this is equivalent to brans - dicke theory @xcite with a scalar - field potential @xmath20 . by designing the potential so that the field mass is sufficiently heavy in the region of high density , it is possible to satisfy both local gravity and cosmological constraints even when @xmath21 is of the order of unity @xcite .",

    "this gives rise to a significant change of the spectral index of the matter power spectrum relative to that in the @xmath1cdm model @xcite .",
    "moreover it was recently shown that the convergence power spectrum in weak lensing observations is subject to a large modification by the non - standard evolution of matter perturbations @xcite .",
