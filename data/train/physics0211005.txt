    "the weak nonlinear response of even the best materials has been a dominant limitation in experimental research on quantum nonlinear optics for many years .",
    "a number of theoretical proposals , including the creation of a two - photon bound state @xcite and few - photon quantum solitons @xcite , have not yet been experimentally realized due to the lack of large - kerr - nonlinear materials .",
    "however , recent research surrounding electro - magnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , which uses atomic coherence to reduce absorption , has opened up a completely new route to achieving large optical nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "an eit medium generally possesses two important features : vanishing resonant absorption and , simultaneously , a refractive index curve with a very steep gradient @xcite .",
    "these two features can significantly enhance the nonlinear interaction strength in multi - level atomic systems .",
    "in addition , the latter can also significantly reduce the group velocity of a probe light pulse and therefore greatly increase the effective interaction time of the pulse with the medium @xcite .",
    "these features may therefore enable one to use an eit medium to achieve nonlinear optical processes at very low light intensities , or even at energies of a few photons per atomic cross section @xcite .",
    "recently , many eit - enhanced nonlinear phenomena have been observed in experiments , including the kerr effect@xcite .",
    "of particular interest to the present work , wang et al .",
    "have measured the kerr nonlinear coefficient for self - phase modulation using a three - level system in rubidium vapor and demonstrated that the nonlinear coefficient is indeed enhanced by eit @xcite .",
    "in addition to the scheme involving three atomic levels , a four - level system is also a candidate for the enhancement of the kerr nonlinearity for self - phase modulation @xcite .",
    "it is not clear at present which , the three - level system or the four - level system , provides the most advantages for the enhancement of kerr nonlinearity for self - action ( self - phase modulation , two - photon absorption ) for very weak light . or alternatively , because a four - level system in some sense contains a three - level subsystem , how does the presence of the fourth level effect the enhancement of the nonlinearity ?",
    "in addition , the four - level system considered in ref .",
    "@xcite did not include the dephasing between the two ground states .",
    "how does the dephasing , which is present in all realistic systems , alter the effective enhancement of the nonlinearity ? in order to answer these two questions , in this paper we analyze a four - level system with dephasing between the ground states .",
    "first , in section ii we quantitatively compare a four - level eit scheme for self - action with the corresponding three - level scheme .",
    "we discern that there are three major contributions , due to energy shifts of the ground states induced by the probe field , to the third - order susceptibility in the four - level system , and we find that quantum interference amongst the three contributions can , not only enhance the third - order susceptibility more effectively in the four - level system than in the three - level system , but also make the ratio between its real and imaginary part controllable .",
    "next , in section iii we analyze the detailed behavior of the most effectively enhanced nonlinearity in the four - level system . as a result we find that in general , the most effective enhancement does not occur exactly at the center of the transparency window due to quantum interference and a finite dephasing rate . on the contrary , it occurs at an offset that is determined by the atomic transition frequency difference and the coupling rabi frequency .",
    "we consider the interaction of two light fields , a coupling field and a degenerate probe field , with a gas of atoms , as shown in fig .",

    "in particular , we show that there is quantum interference , which does not exist in the four - level system with frequency - non - degenerate probes @xcite , amongst the three contributions due to atomic coherence . as a result",

    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , only originates from the three states @xmath40 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , through the off - diagonal density matrix element @xmath29 . its real part has already been demonstrated to be much larger than that of the resonantly enhanced susceptibility without the coupling field at a finite detuning @xcite . here we can understand the unusually large magnitude of @xmath44 in a similar way to ref .",
    "@xcite : the presence of the weak probe field between the states @xmath40 and @xmath2 causes an energy shift of the state @xmath1 , which results in an effective shift of the linear susceptibility @xmath45 curve ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "however , here there is an important difference from ref .",
    "@xcite : these shifts of the curves are not horizontal shifts along the frequency axis , but changes of the gradients of the curves . for @xmath46 , the gradient variation is equivalent to a small rotation of the solid curve around the zero detuning .",
    "then we can understand that although @xmath44 in the situation of eit is much larger than the resonantly enhanced @xmath44 without the coupling field at a finite detuning , the magnitudes of @xmath44 and @xmath47 also become zero at the zero detuning , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "thus the light shift within the three - level subsystem produces a contribution to the third - order susceptibility in the four - level system , and the contribution becomes important when the probe detuning is finite .",
    "next , let us consider the solo contribution of @xmath29 to @xmath41 at a small atomic transition frequency difference @xmath48 plotted by the thin solid lines and the thin dot - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we can find that although both the thin solid curves and the thin dot - dashed curves keep some resemblance of the dashed curves of the three - level system , the magnitudes of some parts of the curves are significantly larger than those of the three - level system at the same frequency .",
    "these variations indicate that the presence of the state @xmath38 has important influence on @xmath41 through @xmath29",

    "@xcite : the presence of the weak probe field between the states @xmath1 and @xmath38 leads to another energy shift of the state @xmath1 , which results in another effective shift of the linear susceptibility @xmath45 , i.e. , the curves experience additional shifts besides the gradient shifts produced within the three - level subsystem . for the real part of the susceptibility ,",
    "the shift is mainly along the frequency axis when the atomic transition frequency difference @xmath49 .",
    "thus the shift results in a finite value of @xmath44 at the center of the transparency window .    next , following eq .",
    "( [ susceptibility ] ) , we include the contribution of @xmath30 in the calculation of @xmath41 , as shown by the thick solid curves and thick dot - dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . in comparison with the corresponding thin solid curves and thin dot - dashed curves",
    ", we can find that both @xmath44 and @xmath47 are drastically changed once again . in particular",
    ", @xmath47 is twice its previous value at zero detuning when @xmath50 , as shown by the two solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "this indicates that the contribution of @xmath30 to @xmath41 is not small , and neglecting its contribution as in ref .",
    "@xcite does not give us correct values of @xmath41 .",
    "we can see that the shift results in another increase of the magnitude of @xmath44 at the center of the transparency window when the atomic transition frequency difference @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , the energy shift of the state @xmath1 due to the interaction of the weak probe field with the states @xmath40 and @xmath2 leads to another effective shift of @xmath45 through @xmath30 .",
    "so far we have found three major contributions of light shifts to the third - order susceptibility in the four - level eit system . however , the most important feature is that there is quantum interference amongst the three contributions because of the existence of the atomic coherence among the atomic levels .",
    "the linear superposition of @xmath29 and @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ susceptibility ] ) shows explicitly that the interference can occur . through comparison of the curves of @xmath41 for different contributions in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we can also discern the variation of the susceptibility due to the interference : the magnitude of @xmath41 may be much increased at certain detuning due to constructive interference , but much reduced at another detuning due to destructive interference .",
    "for example , for @xmath51 , the magnitude of @xmath44 , plotted by the thick dot - dashed curve in fig",
    ". [ fig2 ] ( a ) , is increased in comparison with the thin dot - dashed curve and the dashed curve at the same frequency due to constructive interference ; however , the magnitude of @xmath47 vanishes at the same detuning due to destructive interference , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) . in the four - level system with frequency - non - degenerate probes",
    ", there is no such quantum interference effect @xcite .",
    "this quantum interference process is a unique feature of the four - level system with degenerate probes that we study in this paper . by using this quantum interference we can , not only enhance @xmath41 in the four - level system more than that in the three - level system , but also control the ratio between @xmath44 and @xmath47 , as shown in fig .",
    "comparing the thin curves and the corresponding thick curves , we find that a small probe detuning can produce some zero points for @xmath47 and change the ratio dramatically . if , for example , the four levels are magnetic sub - levels in experiments , one can use a magnetic field to control the atomic transition frequency difference @xmath48 and simultaneously set the probe detuning @xmath52 to achieve expected ratios . undoubtedly , such control of the nonlinear susceptibility will be very useful in a practical design of various optical devices .      because the magnitude of a nonlinear effect per unit length becomes very small at very low light intensities , such as when there are few photons per atomic cross section",
    ", propagating light beams for a long distance in a nonlinear medium is usually a good way to magnify the nonlinear effect .",
    "however , the distance that light beams can propagate is limited by the linear absorption of the medium , which can not be zero even under the conditions of eit because normally @xmath53 is not zero .",
    "thus , the ratio between the nonlinear coefficient and the linear absorption of the medium is the real criterion for the effectiveness of the enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient .",
    "we therefore calculate the ratio between the third - order susceptibility @xmath41 and the imaginary part of the first - order susceptibility @xmath45 : @xmath54 the results for the four - level system and the three - level system are shown in figs .",
