    "sol manifolds are one of thurston s 8 three dimensional geometries @xcite ( geometric structures ) .",
    "the geometrization conjecture is an approach to the geometry of three dimensional manifolds through general topological arguments .",
    "actually one starts with the fact that three dimensional manifolds compose from 2-spheres or torii surfaces . according to the properties and the details of the topological gluing map of the above with @xmath4 or @xmath6",
    ", the resulting manifolds acquire homogeneous metrics ( at least locally ) .",
    "sol manifolds are described by one type of the 8 different homogeneous metrics .",
    "sol manifolds result from @xmath7 stiffennings of torus bundles over the circle .",
    "more elaborately a theorem @xcite states : given m a total bundle space of a @xmath8 bundle over @xmath6 with gluing map @xmath9 and let @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 represent the automorphism of the fundamental group of the torus @xmath8 induced by the gluing map @xmath9 . then the total bundle space admits a sol geometric structure if @xmath10 is hyperbolic , an @xmath13 structure if @xmath10 is periodic and finally a nil structure otherwise .",
    "@xmath10 is hyperbolic and gives rise to an orientable manifold if @xmath14 and we shall dwell on this choice . more formally , the sol structure arises from the @xmath7 stiffening of the mapping torus of a torus diffeomorphism @xmath9 @xcite .    before proceeding let us make a comment on the structure of @xmath10 .",
    "two different hyperbolic gluings with @xmath15 , give rise to different geometric sol structures .",
    "for @xmath10 we will use the matrix representation of the form @xmath16 so the different classes of sol geometric structures are classified by the integer @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "however this classification is not the only one existing @xcite , nevertheless this will do the classification properly in our case .",
    "also we shall take into account only the positive eigenvalues of @xmath10 .",
    "let us be more quantitative on the sol manifold analysis .",
    "consider the manifold @xmath19 described by the periodic coordinates @xmath20 for the torus , defined modulo @xmath4 ( the radius of the compact dimensions ) and @xmath21 @xmath11 @xmath22 be a coordinate of @xmath23 .",
    "the combined action of the torus mapping through the hyperbolic gluing map @xmath10 diffeomorphism ( which we denote as @xmath24 ) is : @xmath25 we give a general notation for the matrix @xmath10 , of the form @xmath26 but in practise we shall use the form of relation ( [ astru ] ) . as we described above , the sol manifold , which is denoted as @xmath0 is the quotient of @xmath19 by the action of @xmath24 , that is @xmath27 .",
    "it is obvious that it is a total torus bundle over @xmath6 , with @xmath8 the fiber , @xmath6 the base space and @xmath10 the hyperbolic gluing map of the torus fibers .",
    "we shall describe the sol manifolds for which the eigenvalues @xmath28 of @xmath10 are positive . for the case of ( [ astru ] )",
    "the characteristic polynomial of the matrix @xmath10 reads : @xmath29 or equivalently : @xmath30 the solutions to equation ( [ charpol1 ] ) are @xmath28 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",

    "the action of @xmath24 in the new coordinate system now reads : @xmath37 the original lattice was orthogonal while the new torus lattice is not . if @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the basis of the lattice after the action of @xmath24 identification , then @xmath40 ( the basis of the new lattice coincide with the eigenvectors of @xmath10 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath28 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "also the coordinates of the fibers @xmath8 are not periodic anymore .",
    "so in order two pairs @xmath41 and @xmath42 define the same point on the torus lattice , the following must hold : @xmath43 with @xmath44 integers and @xmath38 , @xmath39 defined previously .",

    "sol manifolds are hyperbolic manifolds with negative curvature",
    ". the only component of the ricci tensor is @xmath48 for the metric ( [ metricsol ] ) , transformed in the coordinates @xmath49 .",
    "the hyperbolicity is a very interesting feature of sol manifolds , regarding they are torus fibrations . due to their hyperbolicity ,",
    "the distribution of eigenvalues of the laplacian is not poisson .",
    "this might have effects on the gravitons mass splitting , as we discuss later .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to examine the corrections to the gravitational potential caused by an extra dimensional sol manifold .",
    "the spacetime manifold is of the form @xmath1 . in this section",
    "we review the general technique to obtain these corrections .",
    "the presentation is based on reference @xcite .",
    "the techniques that will be presented are applied to compact manifolds , since this is the case of @xmath0 . a generalization to non - compact manifolds",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "consider a spacetime of the form @xmath50 , with @xmath51 an n - dimensional compact manifold and @xmath52 the four dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "suppose there exist a complete set of orthogonal harmonic functions on @xmath52 , @xmath53 , satisfying the orthogonality condition : @xmath54 and the completeness relation : @xmath55 the functions @xmath53 are eigenfunctions of the @xmath17-dimensional laplace - beltrami operator @xmath56 of the manifold @xmath51 , with eigenvalues @xmath57 :",
    "@xmath58 the gravitational potential @xmath59 satisfies the poisson equation in @xmath60 spatial dimensions , when the newtonian limit is taken : @xmath61 with @xmath62 , the mass of the system , @xmath63 the newton constant in @xmath64 dimensions and @xmath65 equation ( [ lap ] ) corresponds to the case of large compact radius limit and has the solution : @xmath66 in the case of our interest , where the compact dimensions have small lengths , we find the harmonic expansion of @xmath59 in terms of the eigenfunctions of the product space @xmath50 , which reads : @xmath67 with @xmath68 denoting the coordinates of @xmath52 and @xmath69 denoting the coordinates of @xmath51 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath70 obey : @xmath71 with solution : @xmath72 finally the gravitational potential is written as : @xmath73 since all point particles in the four dimensional spacetime have no dependence on the internal compact space @xmath51 , we can take @xmath74 in ( [ fingravpot ] ) to obtain the four dimensional gravitational potential : @xmath75 which is valid for large values of @xmath68 , compared to the lengths of the compact dimensions .    in the above general result of relation ( [ fingravpot1 ] )",
    "we shall apply the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of sol manifolds . for the eigenvalues we shall take the first two smallest eigenvalues ( and their corresponding eigenfunctions ) since larger eigenvalues are exponentially suppressed .",
    "in order to compute corrections to the gravitational potential we must solve equation ( [ eigenvalueeq ] ) for the case of sol manifold @xmath0 . a much more elaborate analysis of this section can be found in @xcite we shall use the @xmath35 coordinates we introduced previously .",
    "the laplace - beltrami operator for the manifold @xmath76 is : @xmath77 which stems from the riemannian metric ( [ metricsol ] ) . as usual @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 the basis of the @xmath8 lattice .",
    "thus we must solve @xmath81 since the coefficients of @xmath82 depend on @xmath21 , the form of the solutions of ( [ laplacegener ] ) are of the form : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a vector of the dual lattice of @xmath8 and @xmath85 is a vector of the @xmath8 lattice .",
    "let us note that the vector of the dual lattice @xmath84 can be written @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath87 the vector basis of the dual @xmath8 lattice .",
    "the vector of the @xmath8 lattice can be written : @xmath88 the scalar product of @xmath85 and @xmath84 is identified with the usual product between the reciprocal and the bravais lattice .",
    "now we shall use a proposition of reference @xcite , which says that a function @xmath89 satisfies equation ( [ laplacegener ] ) if and only if @xmath90 satisfies the modified mathieu equation : @xmath91 with @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "also @xmath95 the volume of the sol manifold , @xmath96 , equals the volume of the total bundle space @xmath97 . in the above",
    "@xmath98 is the discriminant of the matrix @xmath10 defined in relation ( [ discri1 ] ) and @xmath99 is the quadratic form ( see @xcite ) corresponding to the matrix @xmath100 acting to the dual lattice of @xmath8 , with @xmath101 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath102 and @xmath103 are related as follows : @xmath104 it is proved in reference @xcite that the functions @xmath105 form a complete orthogonal basis on the sol manifold . also it is found that the spectrum of the laplace - beltrami operator consists of two parts :    * the trivial part , with eigenvalues @xmath106 , corresponding to @xmath107 in the dual lattice and to eigenfunctions @xmath108 , @xmath109 . * the non - trivial part with eigenvalues @xmath110}=\\lambda_k(\\nu[\\gamma])+\\nu([\\gamma])\\cos\\theta$ ] and eigenfunctions the solutions of ( [ modmahtieu ] ) .    in order to compute corrections to the gravitational potential due to sol structure of extra dimensions , we must compute the first eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . we shall use the most interesting case which is when @xmath111 is large ( or equivalently @xmath112 ) .",
    "bear in mind that this term contains the compactification radius of the extra dimensions ( we must state that the radii of all extra dimensions shall be considered equal ) and the deformation of the lattice in terms of @xmath113 . following @xcite when @xmath111 becomes large , @xmath114 becomes small . in that limit the eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator , stemming from the non - trivial part ,",
    "are @xmath115 , with @xmath116 the eigenvalues of the modified mathieu operator , @xmath117 we order the first eigenvalues as @xmath118 .",
    "we shall use the first two , since the corrections to the gravitational potential fall exponentially at the eigenvalues grow larger .",
    "thus the first two are @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which asymptotically reads : @xmath121 with @xmath122 as before : @xmath123 the eigenfunctions corresponding to the mathieu operator ( [ modopoe ] ) are in general , @xmath124\\ ] ] with @xmath125 counting the eigenvalues , @xmath126 corresponds to @xmath127 e.t.c .",
    "now we are ready to compute the modifications to the gravitational potential coming from the first two eigenvalues of the laplace operator on sol manifolds .",
    "thus we substitute @xmath127 and @xmath120 in relation ( [ fingravpot1 ] ) with @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "also we substitute the eigenfunctions for the sol manifold , thus : @xmath130 the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients @xmath131 for @xmath112 ( which is the most interesting case and we shall dwell on it ) is really simple @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the terms of the form @xmath132 tend to @xmath133 , while terms of the form @xmath134 , with @xmath135 tend to zero .",
    "thus the gravitational potential of relation ( [ fingravpot1 ] ) becomes : @xmath136 so for the first two eigenvalues we have @xmath137 or ( using the asymptotic behavior for the coefficients @xmath132 ) : @xmath138 since @xmath119 and using relations ( [ firsteigenvalue ] ) and ( [ c1 ] ) we obtain finally : @xmath139 in the relation above it is clear that the sol manifold correction to the newton s law gravitational potential depends on the compactification radii of the extra dimensions @xmath4 , the angle @xmath113 of the vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 and on the eigenvalues of the hyperbolic gluing map @xmath10 . in the next section",
    "we shall investigate the parameter space of the corrections found ( which is very rich ) and we shall compare it with the @xmath2 manifold corrections , to see how much different these are .",
    "the parameter space of the sol correction to the gravitational potential is very rich .",
    "let us examine first the dependence of the sol correction range @xmath140 on the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath17 .",
    "in figure ( [ 3d1 ] ) we plot the dependence for the compactification radius value @xmath141 ( smaller than the current experimental bound @xmath142 ) and for @xmath143 , while in figure ( [ 3d2 ] ) and ( [ 0201 ] ) the values of @xmath4 are @xmath144 and @xmath145 respectively .",
    "we tried to check the plots near the experimental bound for extra dimensions .",
    "it seems that the sol structure gives very large corrections to gravity if the compactification radius is very small ( of order @xmath146 and smaller ) .",
    "we shall study the interesting cases which have compactification radius around @xmath147 .",
    "also we shall check out the behaviour of the range of the corrections around @xmath148 which is the expected scale that three extra dimensional spaces should have . looking in figures ( [ 3d1 ] ) , ( [ 3d2 ] ) , and ( [ 0201 ] )",
    ", we can see that the last two have similar dependence .",
    "it seems that for large values of @xmath17 ( @xmath149 ) and for @xmath150 , the corrections are very small . in the other two graphs when @xmath151 and for small values of @xmath113 , the corrections are small . in the following",
    "we shall investigate some interesting cases stemming from the above three . to have a clear picture we shall compare the range of sol manifolds with the range of the @xmath2 torus corrections .",
    "in figure ( [ t3 ] ) we plot the range of the @xmath2 corrections as a function of @xmath68 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 and in figure ( [ 005 ] ) the corresponding dependence for the sol manifold case . as expected from figure ( [ 3d1 ] ) , the term @xmath140 is very big compared to @xmath154 , for small @xmath17 ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "as @xmath17 grows the term becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "figure ( [ 005 ] ) corresponds to @xmath156 .",
    "as @xmath17 grows , the range of sol - corrections becomes comparable and after a value of @xmath17 , smaller compared to the @xmath2 corrections .",
    "the small @xmath113 case is similar . concluding the above investigation we could say that the sol range values are big for the above case in which the corresponding torus range values were small .",
    "the case with @xmath157 mm is very interesting .",
    "as we can see in figure ( [ comparissonnew ] ) the range of sol corrections can vary significantly depending on the value that @xmath17 takes .",
    "compared to the corresponding 3-torus range , sol corrections can be much larger ( for small @xmath17 ) and comparable ( for @xmath158 ) but never smaller even for very large @xmath17 .",
    "another result is that general sol corrections can exist for compactification radii and at distances for which the corresponding @xmath2 torus range values are very large ( and consequently not experimentally preferable ) .",
    "in extra dimensional models , gravity behaves exactly as in four dimensional models when long distances are considered . when however we are close at the scale of the extra dimensions , the potential changes and we expect macroscopical changes in the strength and range of the gravitational force .",
    "this is expressed by the relation @xmath159 depending on the topology and geometry of the extra dimensions , the corrections may vary .    there",
    "exist several bounds constraining the size and number of extra dimensions . for gravitational corrections",
    "the strongest constraint comes from the et - wash experiment .",
    "the results show consistency with newtonian gravity down to 200 microns @xcite .    in the add model the scale @xmath160",
    "is taken to be 1 tev .",
    "for this value we obtain the following sizes for extra dimensions with the same radius @xmath4 :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -dependence of the range of @xmath2 and sol corrections for @xmath161    the case of one extra dimension with quantum gravity scale @xmath1621 tev is ruled out by solar system experiments . also two extra dimensions are ruled out since for @xmath160=1 tev the experiments have tested newton s force down to 200 microns .",
    "the add @xmath163 case is not excluded yet with @xmath164 tev .",
    "bounds on extra dimensions are posed when gravitons are taken into account .",
    "gravitons would be copiously produced in colliders unless @xmath160=1 tev for @xmath163 . there",
    "exist stronger bounds when light gravitons are taken into account .",
    "these are emitted from supernovae and the astrophysical bounds for three extra dimensions on @xmath160=1 tev are of the order tev @xcite .    in the case of sol",
    "manifolds the same arguments hold and also , due to the toroidal fibration , equation ( [ massscale ] ) is valid ( the only difference might be in some graviton cross - sections because the distribution of eigenvalues of the laplacian on sol manifolds is such that leads to non - constant mass splitting . in fact",
    "the eigenvalue distribution is not poisson , as for most toric topologies happens .",
    "this will be studied elsewhere ) .",
    "sol space is three dimensional .",
    "taking into account that the experimental and theoretical bound is @xmath165 nm , we compare the range of the three torus corrections and the range of sol manifolds corrections . in figure ( [ comparisson ] )",
    "we plot the range of the two manifolds .",
    "-dependence of the range of @xmath2 corrections for @xmath166 and @xmath167 m ]    as we can see , the range of the sol corrections is significantly larger from the three torus corrections .",
    "also the range of the @xmath2 corrections drop much faster compared to the sol case .",
    "this is very interesting phenomenologically .",
    "in the sol case , the values of the corrections are too close one to each other and in figure ( [ comparisson ] ) appears as a straight line ( but it is not ) .",
    "in addition we found that the values of @xmath17 ( the parameter appearing in the @xmath7 matrix ) and of @xmath113 , do not seem to modify the results significantly , for @xmath168 m .",
    "the last is to be contrasted with the case @xmath169 mm as can be seen in figure ( [ comparissonnew ] ) .",
    "-dependence of the range of @xmath2 and sol corrections for @xmath170 mm for various @xmath17 , and @xmath153 ]    as we can see the @xmath17 value modifies significantly the range of sol corrections when @xmath169 mm . for large @xmath172",
    "the sol corrections are comparable to the 3-torus corrections while for small @xmath17 the range of sol corrections grow larger and larger .",
    "-dependence of the range of sol corrections for @xmath166 and @xmath167 m ]    let us return to the case @xmath173 m and see how the modifications behave down to the @xmath174m(@xmath175 mm ) .",
    "we found that in the 3-torus case , the range of the corrections becomes extremely small for distances @xmath167 m and smaller , while the sol corrections for @xmath167 m still remain significantly larger compared to the torus case , as can be seen in figures ( [ aps ] ) and ( [ mikromegalo2 ] ) . in the case of sol corrections",
    "we can see that around @xmath176 m and lower , the corrections become small as can be seen in figure  ( [ mikromegalo1 ] ) ( although the range still remains significantly larger compared to the 3-torus case ) .",
    "a more complete investigation for small @xmath4 would require a numerical calculation of the eigenvalues of the sol manifold laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "there exists an algorithm that calculates numerically the eigenvalues of three dimensional manifolds and can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "-dependence of the range of sol corrections for @xmath166 and @xmath177 m ]",
    "in this letter we studied the corrections to the gravitational potential caused by an sol manifold extra dimensional compact space .",
    "specifically we used the first two eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator on the sol manifold which showed us that the yukawa type modifications are affected by the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath113 and @xmath4 , where @xmath4 the compactification radius and @xmath113 the angle between the basis vectors of the @xmath8 lattice .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is connected with the matrix @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath7 , which is hyperbolic and defines the gluing of the torus fibers . after investigating",
    "the parameter space we found interesting results , mainly concluding that the range of sol structure corrections can be similar to the @xmath2 torus results and ( more interestingly ) can be very different to the @xmath2 results depending to the values of the parameters .",
    "this is valuable phenomenologically as can be seen in the previous sections .",
    "also let us discuss the fact that for sol manifolds , when @xmath4 is small , the range of the corrections is large compared with the 3-torus case .",
    "this must have to do with the intrinsic hyperbolicity of sol manifolds .",
    "this intrinsic hyperbolicity has effect on the eigenvalues and their distribution . due to this",
    "if we wish to take the limit @xmath178 we must be very careful . in the limit",
    "@xmath178 the eigenvalues grow smaller and smaller much more faster than in the 3-torus case .",
    "thus roughly we could say that newton s law is recovered .",
    "however for large @xmath4 we must take into account the eigenvalues we disregarded since we still work in a compact space but @xmath4 is not small anymore .",
    "some eigenvalues of sol ( not trivial to be found ) can be found in ref.@xcite .    as a final remark",
    "let us note that the values of the range of the sol corrections remain very large compared to the 3-torus ones ( almost flat even at @xmath169 mm ! ) .",
    "this happens even near the experimental limits @xmath175 mm . at first this",
    "may appear very strange but the study involved only the range of the corrections , so the large range values might be interesting feature since the range is divided by the distance @xmath68 . thus in some cases",
    "the corrections might be measurable .",
    "however extra care must be taken when @xmath4 is small , as we mentioned previously .",
    "finally we left unanswered two issues , the graviton production and how do we distinguish sol manifolds corrections from other corrections ( the last due to the rich parameter space of sol manifolds ) .",
    "we hope we address these in the future .",
