    "in the last decades a great deal of work has gone into scalar - tensor theories of gravity , particularly in the context of inflationary models and also in attempts to explain the observed acceleration of the universe . in all these",
    ", the scalar field plays an essential role , although its nature and origin as yet remains unclear .",
    "however , in a recently proposed scalar - tensor theory , the nature of the scalar field is attributed to the space - time geometry @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "physical and geometrical objects are , by construction , invariant under a new group of symmetry , namely , the group of weyl transformations , and this leads to a natural mapping between the action of a scalar - tensor theory with a non - minimally coupled scalar field in a non - riemannian space - time and the action of general relativity with a massless scalar field coupled to gravity through a dimensionless parameter .",
    "recent applications of this new theoretical proposal to cosmology include scenarios displaying unusual geometrical space - time behaviour @xcite .    among other alternative approaches to gravity theories , in which the scalar field emerges",
    ", we would like to call attention for the modern @xmath0-dimensional models of the universe .",
    "these have been developed in many different contexts , starting from the seminal kaluza - klein ideas to string cosmology @xcite . even in a purely classical general relativistic framework a particular appealing cosmological model worth of mentioning is the one obtained in general relativity by chodos and detweiler , who put forward the idea that the present stage of the universe evolved from a five - dimensional scenario in which the extra dimension becomes unobservably small due to a kind of dynamical contraction @xcite . following the same direction ,  other higher - dimensional general anisotropic models have been considered also in scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the introduction of scalar fields and higher dimensions are also motivated by the attempt to answer many open questions in classical cosmology , particularly those related to the early phases of the universe .",
    "one possibility of examining these questions in a deeper way is to go beyond the classical level and look for a new picture in which quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "an important contribution to this line of research has been provided by the quantum cosmology program @xcite .",
    "it should be said , however , that there are currently many technical and conceptual difficulties with this approach .",
    "for instance , a well known problem in quantum cosmology is the definition of time , a problem often referred to as _ the problem of time _ @xcite .",
    "indeed , it turns out that quantum cosmology does not specify in a unique way a parameter that plays the role of time . in the general relativistic context",
    ", there have been several attempts to overcome this difficulty . a well known way of tackling the problem is by introducing matter content into the model , the latter usually being represented by a scalar field associated to a fluid with a barotropic equation of state @xcite . another interesting attempt to find a possible solution to the problem of time in the framework of brans - dicke theory",
    "was given recently @xcite , in which there is no need to add matter in the form of a scalar field as the gravitational theory itself provides such a field . by choosing suitable canonical transformations ,",
    "the brans - dicke scalar field may be identified with time in the sense of the usual schrdinger picture . by the same token ,",
    "in the quantization of a geometrical scalar - tensor theory we can naturally relate the intrinsic scalar field to a parameter that measure the evolution of the system at the quantum level .",
    "the goal of the present work is to analyse quantum cosmological scenarios predicted by the geometrical scalar - tensor theory in an anisotropic n - dimensional space - time . in the context of general relativity ,",
    "the same problem was recently considered by p. letelier @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin , in section 2 , with a brief review of the basic tenets of the geometrical scalar - tensor gravitational theory . in section [ secclassmodel ] , we present the classical solutions of the n - dimensional model in the light of the lagrangian formalism .",
    "we then proceed to perform the hamiltonian formalism and propose some canonical transformations to decouple the canonical variables .",
    "we check that the solutions obtained from the lagrangian formalism are also solutions of the hamiltonian equations .",
    "next , in section [ modelquant ] , we carry out the canonical quantization of the model . by assuming that the classical geometry has a flat spatial section we obtain the wave function of the universe and calculate the expectation values according to the many - worlds interpretation as well as the trajectories in the de broglie - bohm interpretation .",
    "finally , in section [ finalremarks ] , we discuss our results .",
    "let us begin by considering the gravitational sector of the non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor action @xmath1   , \\label{lagrangian weyl frame}\\ ] ] defined on a @xmath0-dimensional space - time , with @xmath2 denoting the @xmath0-dimensional curvature scalar , .",
    "the ricci tensor is defined as @xmath3 . ]",
    "@xmath4 the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath5 , and @xmath6 being a dimensionless parameter . as in the four - dimensional case ,",
    "the field equations for @xmath5 and @xmath7 , together with the non - metricity condition that characterizes a weyl integrable space - time ( wist ) , are easily obtained by applying the palatini s variational method to the above action ( see ref .",
    "thus , the variation of ( [ lagrangian weyl frame ] ) with respect to the affine connection leads to @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "this is precisely the non - metricity condition mentioned above , and that , in a certain sense , leads , from first principles , to the determination of the space - time geometry @xcite . from the above",
    "@xmath10 plays the role of the n - dimensional weyl scalar field . )",
    "gives an expression for the weylian affine connection in terms of the two fundamental geometrical elements of the manifold , namely , the metric tensor and the scalar field .",
    "this may be written as @xmath11 , with @xmath12 denoting the christoffel symbols and @xmath13 , the geometric scalar field .",
    "] in the terminology of the geometrical scalar - tensor theory , a weyl frame is the set @xmath14 characterized by the metric tensor @xmath4 and the scalar field @xmath13 defined on the manifold @xmath15 .",
    "an important property of the weyl geometry is that the non - metricity condition @xmath16 is invariant under the set of transformations @xmath17 that is , in the new frame @xmath18 we have @xmath19 .",
    "clearly , these transformations preserve the geodesic curves , since the affine connection is kept invariant . because @xmath20 and @xmath21 are related by a conformal transformation the causal structure these metric define on the manifold @xmath15 does not change when we go from one weyl frame to another . by setting @xmath22 in ( [ weyl transformations ] ) we have @xmath23 . because we recover the riemannian compatibility condition between the metric and affine connection , this frame",
    "is usually called the _ riemann frame _ , and is denoted as the set @xmath24 .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that in the riemann frame @xmath24 the action ( [ lagrangian weyl frame ] ) becomes @xmath25   , \\label{labrangian riemann frame}\\ ] ] which , for @xmath26 , is formally identical to the @xmath0-dimensional hilbert - einstein action of a scalar field minimally coupled with gravity with a potential @xmath27 given by @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , the analogy between the two configurations is even more apparent if we recall that in the riemann frame , particles and light rays will follow riemannian metric and affine geodesics , respectively . in the next section , we shall investigate the cosmological scenarios that are generated by the action ( [ labrangian riemann frame ] ) , when we take @xmath29 .",
    "we shall now consider the n - dimensional , @xmath30 , anisotropic cosmological model whose geometry is described by the following line element @xmath31 with @xmath32 denoting the lapse function , @xmath33 being the scale factor associated with the usual three spatial dimensions , and @xmath34 representing the scale factor of the @xmath35-dimensions , the latter being assumed to be compact .",
    "the reduced action corresponding to ( [ labrangian riemann frame ] ) written in terms of the geometry given by the line element ( [ ds - model ] ) takes the following form : @xmath36 , \\label{red - action}\\ ] ] where the over dot denotes differentiation with respect to the time coordinate @xmath37 , while @xmath38 stands for the integration on the @xmath39-dimensional space defined by the compact extra dimensions . from ( [ red - action ] ) we write the lagrangian of the model as @xmath40 now , if we set @xmath41 , the field equations , obtained from the euler - lagrange equations , are @xmath42 where we are defining @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "a solution of the equations of motion above is given by the following set @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 denoting the values of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath49 at time @xmath50 , respectively , and @xmath51 is an integration constant .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that the solutions ( [ class sol 1 ] ) represent a universe in which both the usual three dimensions and the extra @xmath52 dimensions expands as time passes , with a space - time singularity at @xmath53 ( see , fig . 1 below ) [ ploteq9 ] .",

    "there are , however , some differences in this case .",
    "while the extra dimensions always expand , the behaviour of the @xmath57-dimensional spatial dimensions depends on the dimensionality of the model : if @xmath58 , then they start from a singularity at @xmath50 and expand forever ; if @xmath59 , they undergo indefinitely a contraction phase ; and if @xmath60 , they remain constant as @xmath61 . in figure [ ploteq10 ] , we show the behaviour of both scale factors , @xmath33 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "let us also note that @xmath6 must be positive for @xmath65 and negative for @xmath66 .    here",
    ", it is interesting to note that according  to ( [ class sol 2 ] ) , a curious scenario arises when @xmath60 . in that case",
    ", the @xmath57-dimensional scale factor @xmath67 is constant . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the time interval between @xmath68 and the finite time @xmath69 , we see that the scale factor @xmath34 goes to zero as @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "[ ploteq10]b ) .",
    "this could perhaps be interpreted as a sort of pre - inflationary period when , immediately after the beginning of the universe , a dynamical compactification of the extra dimensions takes place .",
    "if we now turn our attention to the expansion factor of the universe , a simple calculation from ( [ ds - model ] ) yields @xmath70 at this point , it should be mentioned that the expansion factor ( [ class expansion factor ] ) calculated for the solutions ( [ class sol 1 ] ) and ( [ class sol 2 ] ) is given by @xmath71 that is , @xmath72 has the same value and does not depend on the dimension @xmath0 . in both cases",

    "the first step is to carry out the canonical quantization of the classical model .",

    ", we get for the expansion factor : @xmath148    now let us consider the behaviour of the expansion factor for @xmath114 , shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "although qualitatively similar to the generic case , it is important to highlight here that the behaviour of @xmath72 , as given by ( [ quantum exp factor ] ) , does depend on the space - time dimension , which is distinct from its behaviour at the classical level . a more significant difference concerns the expansion factor of the universe . classically , it is constantly null or decrease with time , according to solutions ( [ class sol 1 ] ) , ( [ class sol 2 ] ) , ( [ class sol ] ) and ( [ class sol 0 ] ) , while in the quantum picture the expansion factor of the universe calculated from the expectation values ( [ quantum exp factor ] ) increases with time .          in this section , we shall proceed to calculate the scale factors in the light of the de broglie - bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "in this work we have investigated the classical and quantum cosmological scenarios predicted by a geometrical scalar - tensor gravitational theory , in an anisotropic @xmath0-dimensional space - time . at the classical level , we have obtained four different sets of solutions .",
    "two of them represent a dynamical singular universe bearing close resemblance to the well - known kasner solution .",
    "the remaining sets of classical solutions show an interesting picture .",
    "in one case we have a non - singular static universe undergoing an expansion regime in the usual three dimensions , while in the extra dimensions we have a contraction .",
    "we regard this result as some kind of a @xmath0-dimensional generalization of the chodos - detweiler model @xcite .",
    "the other case , leading to the opposite behaviour , in which the role of the dimensions are reversed , is also allowed by the field equations .    at the quantum level , we have made use of the approach of quantum cosmology . after carrying out a series of canonical transformations we obtained , after applying the canonical quantization procedure , a schrdinger - like differential equation for the wave function of the universe .",
    "we then found the general solution to this equation and treated separately the cases @xmath183 @xmath165 and @xmath114 , which present similar behaviour . in the many - worlds interpretation we found that the expectation values of the scale factors are clearly not singular and , in fact , describe a bouncing universe .",
    "in other words , the primordial cosmological singularity is avoided and the whole volume of the universe undergoes a contraction phase , reaches a minimum volume and then starts expanding . when compared with the classical regime , we could say that at the quantum level the two classical solutions are linked to give rise to a non - singular universe , in accordance with previous results @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the bohmian trajectories also point to the non - existence of initial singularities and leads to a bouncing model , which does not depend on the space - time dimension .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that , in five dimensions , if we take the de broglie - bohm interpretation , then it is possible to have a picture in which , as in the classical chodos - detweiler model , the 3-dimensional part of the universe expands while the extra - dimensional contracts .    to conclude ,",
    "let us briefly comment on the role played by the weyl field in the framework of this geometrical scalar - tensor theory .",
    "as is already known , the weyl transformations preserve the geodesic lines and a number of other geometrical objects , which then implies the physical equivalence of the class of weyl frames , at the classical level @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has also been shown @xcite that general weyl transformations correspond to canonical transformations in the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "this mathematical fact clearly indicates that when the approach to quantum cosmology is applied to the geometrical scalar - field theory the results obtained must hold in all weyl frames , in other words , by starting with the action written in the general form ( [ lagrangian weyl frame ] ) .",
    "finally , in the context of quantum cosmology it seems appealing to consider that the very geometrical nature of the scalar field leads to a more natural identification of this field with the time parameter that governs the evolution of the quantum variables .",
