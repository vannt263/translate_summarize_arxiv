    "antiferromagnetic correlations play an important role in the physics of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "magnetism is most pronounced in the undoped parent compounds , where the almost uncoupled two - dimensional cuo - planes form magnetic mott insulators with one spin-1/2 electron per cu - site .",
    "the simplest model for a cuo - plane is the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet ( qhaf ) in two dimensions ( 2d ) on a square lattice , @xmath7 the super - exchange coupling @xmath8 is non - zero only if the cu - sites @xmath9 are nearest neighbors . in the undoped compounds",
    "studied experimentally , it assumes values around @xmath10mev .",
    "this model has frequently been considered in the past@xcite .",
    "its ground state at zero temperature @xmath11 appears to be a nel state with an order parameter @xmath12 moderately reduced from its classical value @xmath0 by quantum fluctuations . at finite temperature",
    "@xmath13 the theorem of mermin and wagner prohibits any long - range order . for sufficiently low @xmath4",
    "the magnetic correlation length @xmath14 grows exponentially in the two - dimensional system and diverges at @xmath11 , @xmath15 @xmath14 is measured in units of the lattice spacing , which is set to @xmath16 . in the following we also use @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the exponential factor in @xmath19 has been obtained from quantum - monte - carlo ( qmc ) calculation@xcite of the qhaf , high - temperature series expansion@xcite , schwinger - boson mean - field theory@xcite ( sbmft ) , and modified spin - wave theory@xcite .",
    "the exponent comes out@xcite as @xmath20 .",
    "an exponential behavior like eq.([eqn - xiresult ] ) also results from the ( classical ) non - linear sigma model@xcite ( nl@xmath21 m ) as well as the quantum nl@xmath21 m ( qnl@xmath21 m ) in the so - called renormalized classical regime@xcite .    the theoretical predictions from the qhaf and the ( q)nl@xmath21 m are consistent with experiments on undoped cuprates above their respective nel temperature @xmath22 , confirming the almost two - dimensional nature of fluctuations in these systems .",
    "in particular , a correlation length behaving like eq.([eqn - xiresult ] ) has been seen in quasi - elastic ( energy integrated ) neutron scattering on sr@xmath23cu@xmath24o@xmath25cl@xmath23 ( ref .  ) , sr@xmath23cuo@xmath23cl@xmath23 ( ref .  ) , and la@xmath23cuo@xmath25 ( ref .  ) .",
    "the observed@xcite exponent @xmath26 agrees with theory . a three - dimensional ( algebraic ) behavior might be observable@xcite at temperatures very close to @xmath22 .",
    "the dynamics of spin fluctuations are measured through the dynamical structure factor @xmath27 .",
    "in general two regimes are expected , depending on the wave vector @xmath28 relative to the nel ordering vector @xmath29 : for @xmath30 , i.e. , for distances much longer than the correlation length , the spectrum @xmath31 shows a single peak at @xmath32 with some width @xmath33 that depends weakly on @xmath34 .",
    "the energy scale @xmath35 represents the time scale for relaxation of the order parameter in the disordered phase @xmath13 .",
    "critical slowing down leads to a vanishing of @xmath35 like @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath38 comes out as @xmath39 . for @xmath40",
    "the peak position shifts to finite @xmath41 and becomes @xmath42-dependent , reminiscent of damped spin waves .",
    "these originate from the short - range magnetic order , visible only at distances small compared to the correlation length .",
    "moreover , the dynamical scaling hypothesis@xcite states that for @xmath43 and all @xmath44 spin fluctuations are governed by the single energy scale @xmath35 ; the structure factor obeys the scaling form @xmath45 with the static structure factor ( equal - time correlation function ) @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote ( a priori unknown ) scaling functions .",
    "the dynamical structure factor has been calculated@xcite using the qmc plus maximum - entropy method for the qhaf , molecular dynamics ( md ) on the classical heisenberg model@xcite , the sbmft@xcite , and md on a classical lattice model@xcite equivalent to the qnl@xmath21 m in the renormalized classical regime@xcite . the form ( [ eqn - hypdyn ] ) of the structure factor ,",
    "the presence of propagating modes in the ` shape function ' @xmath48 for @xmath49 , and the energy scale @xmath50 have been well confirmed .",
    "the latter has also been calculated from coupled - mode theory@xcite .",
    "experimentally , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) on several cuprate parent compounds@xcite at temperatures @xmath51 shows a quasi - elastic peak at zero energy , the observed@xcite dynamical exponent is @xmath52 .",
    "the latter is also found in magnetic resonance@xcite .",
    "the ins data is consistent to spin - wave like excitations at higher energies@xcite in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "results for the dynamics of spin fluctuations come primarily from purely numerical approaches like qmc and md .",
    "for an analytical treatment of the heisenberg model , the non - canonical commutation relations of spin operators @xmath53 pose a severe difficulty .",
    "this can be circumvented by re - writing @xmath54 in canonical boson or fermion creation and annihilation operators .",
    "these act on an enlarged hilbert space that contains unphysical states , which have to be removed by imposing a constraint . using schwinger bosons @xmath55 , @xmath56 , the spin-1/2 operator and constraint read@xcite @xmath57 alternatively , one can use abrikosov auxiliary fermions@xcite @xmath58 that carry spin-1/2 , @xmath59 here a lattice - site index @xmath2 has been added ; @xmath60 corresponds to @xmath61 .",
    "the fermion representation ( [ eqn - spinop ] ) of the heisenberg model ( [ eqn - ham ] ) is actually the 1/2-filled ( undoped ) limit of the standard slave - boson formulation of the @xmath62-@xmath63-model .",
    "the latter has been extensively studied using , e.g. , mean - field theory@xcite .",
    "these works focus on the superconducting and normal - state properties of the @xmath62-@xmath63-model at finite hole filling ( doping ) , and its application to the doped cuprate superconductors@xcite . at low hole concentration and",
    "in particular at 1/2-filling the slave - boson mean - field theory gives antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order@xcite .",
    "the strong magnetic correlations at finite temperature in the 2d system , however , have not been considered in this type of approach .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg model ( qhaf ) on a strictly two dimensional square lattice at finite temperature , using the auxiliary - fermion representation ( [ eqn - spinop ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the boson approach@xcite , mean - field theory with fermions leads to a finite nel temperature @xmath64 . while mean - field results are good in the af ordered ground state ( see sect .",
    "[ sec - mf - mf ] below ) , at @xmath13 a self - consistent t - matrix approximation beyond mean - field is required in order to suppress the phase transition .",
    "two approximation schemes will be proposed and compared to the established results reviewed above .",
    "a suitable approximation should be able to fulfill the mermin ",
    "wagner theorem and reproduce the exponentially growing magnetic correlation length , also it should yield a qualitatively correct description of the dynamics including critical slowing down and short - range order .",
    "once the important elements of such an approximation are identified , the theory can possibly be extended to less well understood cases , e.g. , the @xmath62-@xmath63-model at finite hole filling by introducing ` slave ' bosons for the doped holes .",
    "the present study is related to certain self - consistent diagrammatic schemes for the 2d hubbard model , like the flex approximation@xcite : when the magnetic correlation length is growing ( e.g. , due to a reduction of hole filling ) the density of states of electrons is expected to develop a pseudo precursor gap@xcite around the fermi level , reflecting the proximity to an af ordered state which is characterized by zero spectral weight at the fermi energy .",
    "it has been demonstrated@xcite that an approximation with ` reduced self - consistency ' , i.e. , where part of the electron lines in the self energy are replaced by bare ones , favor the formation of such a spectral - weight suppression .",
    "a similar observation is made here : our approximation with reduced self - consistency ( presented in sect .",
    "[ sec - red ] ) is able to produce a propagating spin - wave - like mode , and the spectrum of auxiliary fermions shows a pseudo gap . in the fully self - consistent approximation ( built in close analogy to flex ) , on the other hand , ` spin - wave ' mode and pseudo gap are absent .",
    "the related problem of strong collective cooper - pair fluctuations in the normal state of 2d superconductors has been studied in the past@xcite .",
    "the connection of these approaches to the present work is considered in sect .",
    "[ sec - red ] and appendix [ sec - app - emotion ] .",

    "calculations are performed at low temperatures @xmath66 , where scaling is observed . a possible",
    "crossover to quantum - critical behavior@xcite at higher temperatures is not considered .",
    "sections [ sec - mf - corr ] , [ sec - flex - cons ] [ sec - red - anl ] , and [ sec - remarks ] contain material not directly related to the physics and can probably be skipped in a first reading .",
    "the constraint in eq.([eqn - spinop ] ) requires the fermion charge to be fixed to 1 at each lattice site @xmath2 individually .",
    "this projection can be performed exactly in models like the anderson impurity and kondo model@xcite , which possess just one atomic orbital with strong electron  electron interaction . in models containing a whole lattice of such orbitals",
    "the exact projection leads to a loss of the linked - cluster theorem , which prohibits infinite - order resummation of the perturbation series@xcite and self - consistent approximations based on the skeleton - diagram expansion .",
    "the limit of infinite spatial dimension@xcite has frequently been used to circumvent this problem .",
    "an alternative is to start from a mean - field theory@xcite , where the constraint is observed only in the thermal average .",

    "it is of great help that we can make use of standard feynman - diagram techniques for a perturbation expansion in the interaction @xmath81 .",
    "this requires a mean - field like treatment of the constraint eq.([eqn - constr ] ) , since then perturbation theory starts from ( effectively ) free fermions and wick s theorem can be applied . in principle",
    "the treatment of the constraint can be improved by generalizing the chemical potential @xmath68 to a fluctuating lagrange multiplier@xcite , but we restrict ourselves to the simplest approach@xcite .",

    "the green s function of fermions is always local , i.e. , @xmath92 since unphysical expectation values are zero the local charge @xmath65 introduced in eq.([eqn - constr ] ) is most likely conserved .",

    "<S> the nearest - neighbor quantum - antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model for spin @xmath0 on a two - dimensional square lattice is studied in the auxiliary - fermion representation . </S>",
    "<S> expressing spin operators by canonical fermionic particles requires a constraint on the fermion charge @xmath1 on each lattice site @xmath2 , which is imposed approximately through the thermal average . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting interacting fermion system is first treated in mean - field theory ( mft ) , which yields an af ordered ground state and spin waves in quantitative agreement with conventional spin - wave theory . at finite temperature a self - consistent approximation beyond mean field is required in order to fulfill the mermin  wagner theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss a fully self - consistent approximation , where fermions are renormalized due to fluctuations of their spin density , in close analogy to flex . </S>",
    "<S> while static properties like the correlation length , @xmath3 , come out correctly , the dynamical response lacks the magnon - like peaks which would reflect the appearance of short - range order at low @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this drawback , which is caused by overdamping , is overcome in a ` minimal self - consistent approximation ' ( msca ) , which we derive from the equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the msca features dynamical scaling at small energy and temperature and is qualitatively correct both in the regime of order - parameter relaxation at long wavelengths @xmath5 and in the short - range - order regime at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the impact of vertex corrections and the problem of pseudo - gap formation in the single - particle density of states due to long - range fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show that the ( short - range ) magnetic order in mft and msca helps to fulfill the constraint on the local fermion occupancy . </S>"
