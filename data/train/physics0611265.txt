    "measurements of the @xmath2-@xmath3 transition energies in heavy li - like ions @xcite have lately reached a fractional accuracy of 0.03% with respect to the total qed contribution .",
    "this corresponds to a 10% sensitivity of the experimental results to the two - loop qed effects .",
    "these measurements provide an excellent possibility for identification of the two - loop lamb shift and for testing the bound - state qed theory up to second order in @xmath4 in the strong - field regime .",
    "adequate interpretation of experimental data requires theoretical investigations of the two - loop qed effects valid to all orders in the nuclear - strength parameter @xmath0 .",
    "all - order calculations of the two - loop qed effects and , first of all , the two - loop self - energy correction are important also for low-@xmath5 ions because of a very slow convergence of the corresponding @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the higher - order ( in @xmath0 ) two - loop qed effects presently yield the second largest uncertainty in the theoretical prediction for the ground - state lamb shift in hydrogen ( after the proton charge distribution effect ) . improved theoretical results for the @xmath6 and @xmath3 lamb shift will be required in the near future for a more precise determination of the rydberg constant , when an improved value for the proton charge radius is obtained from the muonic hydrogen experiment @xcite .",
    "the complete set of two - loop one - electron qed corrections ( also referred to as the two - loop lamb shift ) is graphically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2order ] . in this investigation , we will be mainly concerned with the two - loop self - energy correction represented by diagrams ( a)-(c ) , which will be evaluated rigorously to all orders in @xmath0 . the other diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:2order ] will be calculated as well ; diagrams ( d)-(g ) , rigorously and diagrams ( h)-(k ) , within the free - loop approximation , i.e. , keeping the leading term of the expansion of fermion loops in terms of the binding potential .",
    "in the one - loop case , the free - loop approximation corresponds to the uehling potential and yields the dominant contribution even for high-@xmath5 ions like uranium .",
    "we assume that the free - loop approximation is reasonably adequate in the two - loop case also .",

    "i.e. _ , keeping the first nonvanishing contribution in the expansion of the fermion loops in terms of the binding potential .",
    "the error bars specified for these corrections are estimations of uncertainty due to the approximation employed .",
