    "horizontal gene transfer ( hgt ) is considered to be any form of direct transfer of genetic material between two organisms , where one organism is not the parent of the other ( the latter case is known as _ vertical gene transfer _ ) ( ochman et al .",
    "hgt has become a subject of great interest for both molecular and evolutionary biologists , because it is believed that hgt plays a large role in re - shaping prokaryotic genomes ( ochman et al .",
    "2000 ) . in particular",
    ", hgt is believed to be primarily responsible for the rapid spread of antibiotic drug resistance in bacterial populations ( walsh 2000 ) .",
    "given that the emergence of antibiotic drug resistant strains of bacteria has become a major public health concern ( walsh 2000 ) , an understanding of hgt is not only important for advancing our knowledge of biology , but it is also of immense practical significance .    currently , there are three known mechanisms by which hgt occurs ( ochman et al .",
    "2000 ) :    1 .",
    "_ transformation _ : when an organism ( generally a bacterium ) collects genetic material from its environment .",
    "transduction _ : when a virus directly infiltrates a bacterium with genetic material .",
    "3 .   _ bacterial conjugation _ : when a bacterium transfers genetic information via intercellular contact with another bacterium .",
    "bacterial conjugation is believed to be the most important mechanism responsible for hgt ( ochman et al . 2000 ) , and so , in this paper , we will focus on developing mathematical models describing the role that conjugation - mediated hgt has on the mutation - selection balance of bacterial populations .",
    "given the presumed importance that hgt has for the spread of antibiotic drug resistance in bacterial populations , the mathematical models we develop will look at the influence of hgt on the mutation - selection balance in the presence of an antibiotic .",
    "the best characterized bacterial conjugation system is the f@xmath0/f@xmath1 system ( russi et al .",
    "2008 ) . here , a bacterium containing what is termed an _",
    "f - plasmid _ fuses with a bacterium lacking the f - plasmid .",
    "the bacterium containing the f - plasmid is termed an f@xmath0 bacterium while the bacterium that does not contain this plasmid is termed an f@xmath1 bacterium .",
    "when the f@xmath0 bacterium meets an f@xmath1 bacterium , it transfers one of the strands of the f - plasmid to the f@xmath1 bacterium via a pilus .",
    "once a strand of the f - plasmid has been transferred from the f@xmath0 bacterium to the f@xmath1 bacterium , a copy of the plasmid in both cells is produced by daughter strand synthesis using the dna template strands .",
    "the f@xmath1 bacterium then becomes an f@xmath0 bacterium that transcribes its own pilus and is able to transfer the f@xmath0 plasmid to other bacteria in the population ( russi et al .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the f@xmath0/f@xmath1 system is not the most common form of bacterial conjugation .",
    "it is what is known as a _",
    "narrow spectrum _ conjugation mechanism ( tenover 2006 ) , since the f@xmath1 plasmid may only be transferred between cells that are from similar strains .",
    "however , it is known that the genes for resistance to various antibiotic drugs have been transferred between distinct strains of bacteria , suggesting that a _ broad spectrum _",
    "conjugation mechanism is likely the important form of hgt leading to the spread of antibiotic drug resistance in bacterial populations ( tenover 2006 ) . nevertheless ,",
    "because all of the bacterial conjugation mechanisms follow a pathway that is similar to the f@xmath0/f@xmath1 pathway , we will use the f@xmath0/f@xmath1 system as the basis for developing our mathematical models of conjugation - mediated hgt .",
    "we assume an asexually reproducing bacterial population , where the genome of each bacterium consists of two double - stranded , semiconservatively replicating dna molecules .",
    "the first dna molecule contains all of the genes necessary for the proper growth and reproduction of the bacterium itself .",
    "this dna molecule corresponds to the large , circular chromosome that defines the bacterial genome .",
    "we assume that there exists a wild - type genome characterized by a  master \" dna sequence .",
    "it is assumed that a bacterium with the master genome has a wild - type fitness , or first - order growth rate constant , given by @xmath2 .",
    "such a bacterium is termed _",
    "viable_. furthermore , making what is known as the _ single - fitness - peak _ approximation ( tannenbaum and shakhnovich 2005 ) , we assume that any mutation to the bacterial genome renders the genome defective , so that the bacterium then has a fitness of @xmath3 . bacteria with defective genomes are termed _",
    "unviable_.    the second dna molecule is the f - plasmid , which we assume consists of two regions .",
    "the first region comprises the various genes necessary for bacterial conjugation itself , i.e. for allowing the plasmid to move between bacteria .",
    "the second region is assumed to encode for the various enzymes conferring resistance to a given antibiotic .",
    "for this initial study , we are interested in the interplay between conjugation - mediated hgt and antibiotic drug resistance at mutation - selection balance ( we will consider adaptive dynamics later ) , and so this is the simplest model that incorporates these various effects .    as with the single - fitness - peak approximation made for the bacterial genome , for the f - plasmid",
    "we assume that there are master sequences for both the conjugation and antibiotic drug resistance regions . if the region coding for bacterial conjugation corresponds to a given master sequence , then , assuming that the bacterium is also viable , the f - plasmid may move into another viable f@xmath1 bacterium .",
    "otherwise , we assume that plasmid can not move into another bacterium , in which case the bacterium is treated as an f@xmath1 bacterium .",
    "similarly , if the region coding for antibiotic drug resistance corresponds to a given master sequence , then we assume that the bacterium is resistant to the antibiotic . otherwise , the bacterium is not resistant to the antibiotic , and is assumed to die according to a first - order rate constant given by @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that only viable bacteria interact with the antibiotic , since non - viable bacteria do not grow and so may be treated as dead .",
    "a given genome may be characterized by a three symbol sequence @xmath5 , specifying the state of the viability , conjugation , and resistance portions of the genome , respectively .",
    "a  + \" is taken to signify that the given genome region is identical to the corresponding master sequence , and a  - \" is taken to signify that the given genome region differs from the corresponding master sequence .    to develop the evolutionary dynamics equations governing this population , we let @xmath6 denote the number of organisms in the population with genome @xmath7 .",
    "we wish to develop expressions for @xmath8 for the various @xmath7 .",
    "since we are only interested in the viable population , the @xmath7 of interest are @xmath9 .",
    "we must now consider the various aspects of the evolutionary dynamics that affect the expressions for the @xmath8 .",
    "the first aspect of the dynamics that we consider is replication : during the semiconservative replication of the bacterial genome , the strands of the dna molecule separate and serve as templates for daughter strand synthesis .",
    "daughter strand synthesis is not necessarily error - free , so that there is a probability @xmath10 , denoted the replication fidelity , that a given template strand will produce a daughter genome that is identical to the original parent .",
    "because our genome consists of three genome regions , we may define three such probabilities , denoted @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , corresponding to the replication fidelities for the viability , conjugation , and resistance portions of the genome . for a replication fidelity @xmath10",
    ", it follows that a template strand derived from a master genome region has a probability @xmath10 of forming a daughter genome region that is identical to the parent , and a probability of @xmath14 of forming a mutated daughter .",
    "if we assume that sequence lengths are long , then making an assumption known as the _ neglect of backmutations _",
    "( tannenbaum and shakhnovich 2005 ) , we assume that a template strand derived from a parent that differs from the master genome produces a daughter that differs from the master genome with probability @xmath2 .",
    "the basis for this assumption is that for very long genomes , mutations will typically occur in previously unmutated regions of the genome , so that mutations will tend to accumulate .    the second aspect of the dynamics that we consider is conjugation :",
    "we assume that conjugation occurs between a viable f@xmath0-bacterium and a viable f@xmath1-bacterium .",
    "thus , conjugation can only occur between a bacterium of type @xmath15 and a bacterium of type @xmath16 .",
    "this process is modeled as a second - order collision reaction with a rate constant @xmath17 .",
    "the conjugation process itself involves the transfer of one of the strands of the plasmid from the f@xmath0-bacterium to the f@xmath1-bacterium , so that the full plasmid needs to be re - synthesized in both bacteria via daughter strand synthesis .",
    "this introduces the possibility of replication errors in either one of the bacteria .",
    "it should be emphasized that we are assuming for simplicity that all bacteria in the population contain exactly one plasmid .",
    "this plasmid may contain the correct copies of the genes for conjugation , in which case the bacterium is an f@xmath0-bacterium , or the plasmid may contain defective copies of the genes for conjugation , in which case the bacterium is an f@xmath1-bacterium .",
    "we also assume that , during conjugation , the plasmid transferred from the f@xmath0-bacterium replaces the plasmid in the f@xmath1-bacterium .",
    "this is a simplifying assumption that will obviously have to be re - examined in future research , where we anticipate developing more accurate models that allow for variable plasmid numbers in the bacterial cell .    putting everything together",
    ", we obtain that the evolutionary dynamics equations are ,    @xmath18 n_{+++ } \\nonumber \\\\ &    & \\frac{d n_{++-}}{dt } = [ 2 p_v p_c - 1 - \\kappa_d + \\frac{\\gamma}{v } ( 2 p_c - 1 ) ( n_{+-+ } + n_{+-- } ) ] n_{++- }   \\nonumber \\\\ &    & + 2 p_c ( 1 - p_r ) [ p_v + \\frac{\\gamma}{v } ( n_{+-+ } + n_{+-- } ) ] n_{+++ } \\nonumber \\\\ &    & \\frac{d n_{+-+}}{dt } = [ 2 p_v p_r - 1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{v } ( n_{+++ } + n_{++- } ) ] n_{+-+ }   + 2 ( 1 - p_c ) p_r [ p_v + \\frac{\\gamma}{v } ( n_{+-+ } + n_{+-- } ) ] n_{+++ } \\nonumber \\\\ &    & \\frac{d n_{+--}}{dt } = [ 2 p_v - 1 - \\kappa_d - \\frac{\\gamma}{v } ( n_{+++ } + n_{++- } ) ] n_{+-- }   + 2 ( 1 - p_c ) ( 1 - p_r ) [ p_v + \\frac{\\gamma}{v } ( n_{+-+ } + n_{+-- } ) ] n_{+++ }   \\nonumber \\\\ &    & + 2 ( 1 - p_c ) [ p_v + \\frac{\\gamma}{v } ( n_{+-+ } + n_{+-- } ) ] n_{++- } + 2 p_v ( 1 - p_r ) n_{+-+ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is defined as the system volume . to put the equations into a form that makes the analysis of the mutation - selection balance possible , we define the total population @xmath20 , and then define population fractions @xmath21 via @xmath22 .",

    "however , because at this stage there is no discrimination between parent and daughter strands , a mismatch is either correctly repaired with probability @xmath28 , or is fixed as a mutation in the genome with probability @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the net per - base mismatch probability is @xmath29 .",
    "if the total sequence length is @xmath30 , then the probability of producing a mutation - free daughter from a given parent template strand is @xmath31 .",
    "if we define @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 is the average number of mismatches per template strand per replication cycle , and if we assume that @xmath34 while @xmath33 is held constant , then we obtain that @xmath35 . for the case of the three - gene model we are considering ,",
    "we let @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denote the lengths of the genome controlling viability , conjugation , and resistance , respectively . defining @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42",
    ", we then obtain that , @xmath43    it should be noted that holding @xmath33 constant in the limit of infinite genome length is equivalent to assuming a fixed per genome replication fidelity in the limit of long genomes .",
    "in this section , we will solve for the mean fitness at mutation - selection balance , denoted by @xmath44 , for two different sets of parameter regimes : we will first consider the case of arbitrary @xmath4 , but with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we will then consider the case of arbitrary @xmath47 , but with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "both sets of cases are analytically solvable , and may be used to qualitatively understand the behavior of @xmath44 for arbitrary values of @xmath4 and @xmath47 .    in order to avoid having the derivation of the results interfere with the results themselves , for convenience we present the final analytical results for each parameter regime being considered , and then provide the derivations in a subsequent subsection .",
    "we do not relegate the derivations to an appendix , as we believe that they are sufficiently interesting to remain part of the main text .      in the limit where @xmath45",
    ", the ability for conjugation is lost due to genetic drift ( since it is never used ) , and we obtain that , @xmath50    we now consider the limit where @xmath46 .",

    "now we consider the behavior of @xmath44 for arbitrary values of @xmath47 , but where @xmath4 is either very small or very large .",
    "combined with the results of the previous subsection , we may then piece together a qualitative sketch of how @xmath44 depends on @xmath4 and @xmath47 .    when @xmath48 , there is no selective advantage for maintaining antibiotic drug resistance genes in the genome , and so we expect these genes to be lost to genetic drift .",
    "thus , we expect , at mutation - selection balance , that @xmath55 , so we need only consider the populations @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ". we may also show that @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of viable conjugators , @xmath59 , exhibits a transition as a function of @xmath47 . for sufficiently small values of @xmath47",
    ", we have that @xmath60 , while for sufficiently large values of @xmath47 , we have that , @xmath61    the transition between the two regimes may be shown to occur at , @xmath62    it may be shown that the disappearance of the conjugators below the critical value of @xmath47 corresponds to a localization to delocalization transition over the portion of the plasmid coding for conjugation , so that this transition is a conjugation - mediated hgt analogue of the well - known error catastrophe from quasispecies theory ( tannenbaum and shakhnovich 2005 ) .    to understand this behavior",
    ", we note that plasmids with defective genes for conjugation nevertheless replicate due to the replication of the bacteria in which they reside .",
    "thus , for plasmids with functional genes for conjugation to be preserved in the population , their additional growth rate due to conjugation must overcome the loss of functionality due to replication mistakes in the genes controlling conjugation .",
    "if the conjugation rate is too slow and unable to overcome this loss of functionality , then the fraction of conjugators in the population drops to zero .",
    "we now consider the case where @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast to the case where @xmath46 of the previous subsection , where we could solve for @xmath44 for arbitrary values of @xmath4 , here we can not readily analytically solve for @xmath44 for arbitrary values of @xmath47 . however , we can obtain analytical solutions for @xmath44 in certain limiting cases of @xmath47 , and then interpolate between the two solution regimes .",
    "as will be seen in the subsection comparing theory and simulation , this approach turns out to be fairly accurate .    in the first limiting case",
    ", we assume that @xmath47 remains finite in the limit that @xmath49 .",
    "this assures that @xmath63 , since the rate of death due to the presence of antibiotics is so fast that no non - resistant genotypes are present in the population .",
    "the fact that @xmath47 is taken to be finite in the limit that @xmath49 means that a non - resistant genotype can not be  rescued \" via conjugation with a resistant bacterium before death occurs .",
    "we then obtain that either @xmath64 , or that @xmath44 is the solution to the following equation :    @xmath65 \\bar{\\kappa } - [ 2 p_v p_c p_r - 1 + 2 p_r ( 1 - p_v ) ( 1 - p_c)]}\\ ] ]    in the first case , we have that @xmath53 , while in the second case we have that @xmath52 .",
    "the transition between the two regimes may be shown to occur at , @xmath66}{(2 p_v p_r - 1 ) ( 2 p_c p_r - 1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 for @xmath67 and @xmath52 for @xmath68 .",
    "we may show that this expression for @xmath69 is larger than the corresponding expression for the @xmath70 case .    to understand the behavior of @xmath44 where @xmath68",
    ", we consider the asymptotic behavior of @xmath44 in the limit as @xmath46 . in this case , eq .",
    "( 8) reduces to , @xmath71 we may show that this expression is smaller than the expression for @xmath44 obtained in the arbitrary @xmath4 , infinite @xmath47 case .",
    "we now consider the second limiting case in the @xmath49 limit , specifically where @xmath47 is itself infinite . here , however , the ratio between @xmath4 and @xmath47 may play an important role in the competition between death of non - resistant bacteria , and their  rescue \" by conjugation with resistant bacteria . thus , here , we will assume that both @xmath72 , but we will take @xmath73 to have some given value in this limit . for large values of this ratio , we expect the rescue effect to dominate over bacterial death , and so the value of @xmath44 should approach the value obtained for arbitrary @xmath4 in the @xmath46 limit . for small values of this ratio , we expect bacterial death to dominate over conjugation , and so the value of @xmath44 should decrease to a value that will need to be determined .",
    "we may show that ,    @xmath74 \\bar{\\kappa } - [ 2 p_v p_c p_r - 1 + 2 p_r ( 1 - p_v ) ( 1 - p_c ) ] } { [ 2 p_v p_c p_r - 1 + 2 ( 1 - p_v ) ( 1 - p_c ) ] - ( 2 p_c - 1 ) \\bar{\\kappa}}\\ ] ]    and so obtain that , @xmath75    therefore , for large @xmath4 , we expect that @xmath44 will initially be given by @xmath76 up to a critical value of @xmath47 , after which it begins to decrease according to eq .",
    "once @xmath47 becomes sufficiently large , we expect that the @xmath73 ratio is such that the functional form for @xmath44 transitions from the finite @xmath47 solution to the infinite @xmath47 , fixed @xmath73 solution . to estimate the transition point between the two solution regimes , we equate the values for @xmath47 as a function of @xmath44 for the two solutions .",
    "this allows us to solve for @xmath44 and thereby allow us to solve for @xmath47 .",
    "we then obtain that the transition point occurs at ,    @xmath77    note that , as @xmath49 , we have that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , so the assumptions that allowed us to make the calculation above are valid .",
    "figure 2 shows plots of @xmath44 versus @xmath33 for both the @xmath45 , @xmath46 limits .",
    "plots were obtained using both the analytical formulas obtained in this paper , as well as via stochastic simulations of replicating organisms .",
    "note the good agreement between theory and simulation .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the regimes , as a function of @xmath33 and @xmath47 , where there exist a positive fraction of conjugators at steady - state , and where the fraction of conjugators is zero .",
    "this is computed for the @xmath70 limit .",
    "note that , as @xmath33 increases , @xmath47 must be pushed to higher values so that there is a positive fraction of conjugators at steady - state . as explained before ,",
    "this increase in @xmath47 is necessary to overcome the mutation - induced loss of functionality as @xmath33 increases .",

    "note that already for @xmath80 the approximate analytical solutions capture the dependence of @xmath44 on @xmath47 fairly accurately .        due to the nature of exponential growth , for the population fractions to converge to a stable steady - state we must have that , @xmath81 . because @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , it follows that @xmath84 .",

    "although the results of our paper are based on a highly simplified model , they nevertheless suggest that hgt does not provide a selective advantage in a static environment .",
