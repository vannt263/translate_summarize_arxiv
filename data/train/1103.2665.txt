    "this work addresses manifestations of a broken symmetry in double - component , buoyancy - driven convection resulting from the boundary conditions for one component being different from those for the other .",
    "such convection has recently been identified as a fundamental class of pattern - forming hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "the objective of this study is to establish the understanding of these instabilities for problems where a major element of previously assumed reflection symmetry is absent : the distinction between the components coming from one boundary of the fluid domain is not reflected at the other .",
    "the paradigm of double - component convection in pure fluid first arose in the context of conventional double - diffusive convection .",
    "this is a class of phenomena resulting from the effects of unequal diffusion coefficients of two density - affecting components @xcite . among numerous natural science and technology applications of this subject emphasized in its initial reviews @xcite , particular attention",
    "has subsequently been focused on small - scale oceanography @xcite , ordinary evolution of stars @xcite , geology @xcite , geodynamo @xcite , and crystal growth @xcite .",
    "recently , relevance of double - component convection has also been highlighted for the dynamics of proto - neutron stars during core - collapse supernova explosions @xcite , as well as for colloidal suspensions @xcite , and soap films @xcite .",
    "since the boundary conditions for one component are generically expected to be different from those for the other , the effects of such different component conditions are relevant to all the above areas of application of conventional double - diffusive convection .",
    "however , these effects also apply to an eddy - diffusion description of large - scale environmental and turbulent processes , where disparity between the component diffusivities may be practically negligible .",
    "such processes range from circulations @xcite to the global ocean thermohaline circulation @xcite and associated climate change @xcite . in addition ,",
    "convective flows are commonly used in fundamental studies of transition to turbulence @xcite and nonlinear pattern formation @xcite .",
    "one major subclass of double - component instabilities arising from the effects of different boundary conditions comprises phenomena whose nature is conceptually analogous to the classical double - diffusion @xcite .",
    "differential diffusion caused by unequal component gradients forming in perturbed state due to the different boundary conditions ( differential gradient diffusion ) triggers convection analogously to the effects of disparate diffusivities .",
    "generalizing the idea in @xcite , such analogy has been introduced in @xcite and scrutinized in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nature of an oscillatory instability highlighted in @xcite and analyzed in @xcite is analogous to that in the diffusive regime of the classical double - diffusion @xcite .",
    "the viscous problem with the stratification inverse to that in @xcite also gives rise to a mechanism of steady convection @xcite that is conceptually analogous to the finger instability in conventional double - diffusive convection @xcite .",
    "this mechanism generates circulations in the presence of a stable background density stratification @xcite . for the component conditions being different only at one boundary and the other boundary being infinitely distant , the stratification considered in @xcite",
    "has been more recently treated in @xcite .    for two horizontal component gradients arising in a laterally heated stably stratified slot , the effect of different boundary conditions @xcite is also analogous to the classical double - diffusion @xcite . as in conventional double - diffusive convection @xcite , in addition",
    ", steady finite - amplitude instability is triggered from the state of rest by different sidewall boundary conditions for two compensating horizontal gradients of the components @xcite .",
    "arising without the linear steady instability of the conduction state @xcite , however , such a finite - amplitude manifestation of convection in @xcite also exposes an oscillatory linear instability whose nature is underlain by differential gradient diffusion @xcite .",
    "effects of different boundary conditions also extend beyond the instabilities being due to differential gradient diffusion .",
    "as reported in @xcite , finite - amplitude steady convection arises well before onset of the respective linear instability in the viscous version of the problem in @xcite .",
    "it is then generated by the feedback coming from nonlinear  convection , despite the stabilizing role of differential gradient diffusion .",
    "potential relevance of such a mechanism to abruptly changing global environmental phenomena @xcite makes its examination under more realistic conditions particularly important .    in the above studies of slot double - component convection due to different boundary conditions , the condition for either component at one slot boundary has been identical to the respective condition at the other .",
    "the considered problems have thus been reflectionally symmetric across the slot .",
    "being an important initial simplification , the reflection symmetry is however unlikely to be maintained in real - world applications of the effects of different boundary conditions .",
    "this is also particularly relevant if the component - dependent forces other than the buoyancy forces are considered , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "manifestation of physical laws in the absence of certain symmetries underlying them could make both the laws themselves and their broken symmetries hardly recognizable .",
    "this has been repeatedly illustrated in elementary particle physics and cosmological theories of unification of fundamental forces @xcite .",
    "another illustration is the irreversibility in statistical mechanics @xcite and its generalized ( symmetric ) interpretation @xcite . in geophysics ,",
    "the global ocean thermohaline circulation also involves asymmetries @xcite .",
    "clarification of the nature of such asymmetries is viewed as critical for understanding past and predicting future major changes of the earth climate @xcite .    for classic hydrodynamic instabilities",
    ", one can refer to the structure of multiple steady flows in the experiment @xcite , where translation invariance is broken by end walls .",
    "complex as it becomes when the cylinder aspect ratio is increased @xcite , this structure is not expected to transform into that in the translationally invariant problem even when the aspect ratio tends to infinity @xcite .",
    "in addition , if oscillatory instability arises in a flow that is both reflectionally and translationally symmetric , the corresponding bifurcation would give rise to two respectively symmetric oscillatory branches @xcite .",
    "elimination of one of the symmetries from such a system could thus have a major effect on the structure and nature of its nonequilibrium flows .",
    "the general objective of the present work has been to provide a comprehensive insight into the effects of different boundary conditions in a slot where the previously assumed boundary conditions symmetry is broken . in a class of such problems , the component conditions are different only at one slot boundary ( hereafter , the distinction boundary ) .",
    "these problems are addressed for such a joint component condition at the other ( hereafter , the similarity boundary ) as can range from the flux to the fixed - value type .",
    "being referred to as the inverse boundary , this other boundary is also considered with such different component conditions as are prescribed oppositely to the distinction boundary .    among consequences of the broken symmetry is a universality of oscillatory manifestation of the effects of different boundary conditions in viscous fluid .",
    "for all above types of the boundary conditions , the steady linear instability analogous to that in @xcite transforms into an oscillatory one for any slot deviation from the horizontal orientation .",
    "three - dimensionality and , eventually , an isolated nonlinearity , hysteresis , and other abrupt changes in such oscillatory - linear - instability curves are underlain by the respective horizontal - slot steady instabilities .",
    "other new three - dimensional effects come from abruptly emerging zero thresholds of the inviscid oscillatory instability .",
    "most pronouncedly manifested herein for the fixed - value similarity boundary , the mechanism of finite - amplitude steady convection @xcite is also relevant when the component condition at this boundary is closer to the flux than to the fixed - value type .",

    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as @xmath22 ( i.e. , the compensating background gradients ) are assumed .    as in @xcite ,",
    "the component diffusivities are set equal to eliminate the classical double - diffusive effects .",
    "such an approach has also been adopted in most studies of conventional double - diffusive convection , where the components with unequal diffusivities were not distinguished from each other in terms of their boundary conditions . in principle ,",
    "equal diffusivities can also be experimentally modeled with two solutes @xcite .",
    "the number , which would then be significantly different from the present @xmath23 , is not expected to have a qualitative effect on the main results and physical interpretations discussed herein .",
    "equal diffusivities could be interpreted as eddy transport coefficients as well , as in @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 is then also within the range of realistic values for all diffusion coefficients to be of the eddy type .    for facilitating comparison of the results for an inclined or vertical slot with those for a horizontal slot ,",
    "this study is focused on the exactly compensating background gradients ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this eliminates the along - slot motion arising when the slot orientation differs from horizontal .",
