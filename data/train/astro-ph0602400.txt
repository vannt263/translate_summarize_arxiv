    "a significant density of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe has been observed on many length scales .",
    "the first evidence of the current dark matter problem came from the dynamics of the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "evidence of dm on a galactic scale came from rotation curves of galaxies which show that the orbital velocities of stars in galaxies do not follow the mass density derived from cataloging the luminous matter@xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be resolved by adding a large amount of dark matter , a dm halo , that would not be included in a count of stars , gas and dust .",
    "more recent evidence of dm includes observations of the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background , the luminosity - redshift relation for supernovae , and the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis which measure a baryonic density of @xmath0 and a total matter density of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this implies that over 80% of the matter in the universe is dark and non - baryonic .",
    "one class of candidates for non - baryonic dm is the weakly interacting massive particle , the wimp .",
    "theories such as supersymmetry , an extension of the usual space - time coordinates to include non - commuting coordinates , naturally include wimp candidates .",
    "wimps are predicted to annihilate into other particles with energies similar to the original mass .",
    "the annihilation rate is a critical parameter in determining the relic density of these wimps and consequently one measure of whether they are a good candidate for a bulk of the dark matter .",
    "photons will result from the annihilation , either directly , or through pion decay or acceleration of charged annihilation products .",
    "the annihilation could thus result in a `` wimp star '' shining in gamma rays with energies near the particle mass .",
    "recent advances in gamma - ray astronomy may allow the detection of dm annihilation .",
    "ground based gamma - ray telescopes are currently sensitive to photons with energies above 100 gev and have reached the sensitivity of a few percent of the crab nebula flux .",
    "the most sensitive ground - based gamma - ray observatory currently in operation is the hess array in namibia@xcite .",
    "the galactic center ( gc ) has been proposed for observations of dm annihiliation @xcite because it is close and might have a dense concentration of dark matter resulting in a strong signal of gamma rays .",
    "after tentative detections of a tev gamma - ray flux from the gc by the veritas collaboration @xcite and the cangaroo collaboration @xcite , the hess collaboration @xcite has initiated observations of the gc .",
    "hess has reported a steady excess of tev gamma - rays from the gc during two observational periods of @xmath2 hours and @xmath3 hours ( at the 6 sigma and 9 sigma levels respectively ) .",
    "this excess of gamma rays is confined to a region of 3 arcminutes centered around sagittarius a@xmath4 , the dynamical center of the galaxy which is believed to host a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this excess is a power law ( @xmath5 ) with @xmath6 in the energy range [ 0.2,8.8 ] tev @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is harder than typical gamma - ray sources such as plerions and active galactic nuclei .",
    "however , many of the newly discovered supernova remnants have similar spectra @xcite .    the gc gamma - ray flux may be produced by a variety of mechanisms @xcite .",
    "for example , the central 4 million solar mass black hole could produce the gamma - ray flux by accelerating electrons in an extreme advection - dominated accretion flow , there is a high rate of supernovae near the gc and the shock fronts could accelerate particles to tev energies .",
    "alternatively it could be due to dm annihilation .",
    "the gc has been suggested as a possible site of enhanced dm annihilation  @xcite because it has a large stellar cusp and a million solar mass black hole in the center . the minimum radius to which any central dark matter density features extend is a key unknown in predicting the gamma - ray flux from wimp annihilation .",
    "the interpretation of the photon flux from the gc is not settled and could lead at the very least to another example of an extreme particle accelerator , and possibly could shed light on the dark matter problem .    in this paper",
    "we consider the dm interpretation of the gc gamma - ray emission and study if any more information on this hypothesis is contained in the dynamical measurements of the mass profile at the gc .",
    "advancements in infrared astronomy are testing the small scale mass profile of the center of the milky way , down to tens of au .",
    "with the w.m .",
    "keck 10 m telescope , proper motions of stars have been monitored near the gc since 1996 @xcite .",
    "entire orbits have been or will soon be measured around the dynamical center of the galaxy .",
    "a strong gamma - ray signal from the gc implies a large amount of dm under the wimp annihilation hypothesis .",
    "the change in mass enclosed in a sphere with radius @xmath7 , the distance from the gc to the star , changes as the stars , on highly elliptical orbits , traverse any central spherically symmetric density enhancement of the dark matter .",
    "this could lead to an observable deviation of the orbit from a purely keplerian orbit .",
    "upcoming observations will provide direct constraints on the dm density profile in the center of the milky way @xcite and help us interpret the gamma - ray flux from the gc .",
    "we use the data on the stellar orbits around the gc published in @xcite .",
    "more recent data , including the complete orbital shapes , may provide further constraints @xcite .",
    "we find that the gamma - ray flux from the gc is compatible with annihilation of a heavy , @xmath8 10 tev , dm particle with a density profile consistent with the stellar orbits near the gc .",
    "depending on the particle physics assumptions , the stellar orbits constraint is comparable but slightly stronger than the constraint on the source extension due to the angular resolution of hess .",
    "gamma - ray observations could have a very strong signature of wimp annihilation due to the process @xmath9 , which would create a monochromatic line in the energy spectrum at the mass of the annihilating particle .",
    "unfortunately , we find that for a tev neutralino the flux of the monochromatic line is too weak to be seen with an energy resolution of 10% , the resolution of the atmospheric cherenkov method .    in the next section we review the analysis used to connect the gamma - ray emission to the stellar dynamics considered .",
    "we define expressions for the expected gamma - ray flux from wimp annihilation with the purpose of clarifying its angular dependence and the units .",
    "next we discuss the dark matter profiles we will use .",
    "we then study the limits imposed on dark matter at the gc by the astronomical mass measurements and the hess angular profile . finally , in section",
    "iii we present the conclusions of the analysis .",
    "the flux of photons produced by dm annihilation depends on four factors : the annihilation products energy spectrum , the dm particle mass , its annihilation cross - section , and the density of the dm particles .",
    "the energy spectrum of the annihilation products , the annihilation cross - section , and the particle mass can be calculated once a particle model is specified .",
    "the density profile of a dark matter halo has long been a subject of much debate in the literature .",
    "theoretical astrophysical considerations and numerical simulations have been used to suggest a family of dm halo shapes that could exist .",
    "the wimp annihilation rate is proportional to the square of the particle density and many of the suggested dm halo shapes formally diverge when the emission rate is integrated along the line of sight through the center of the halo .",
    "the annihilation flux in the center of the dm halo will dominate the flux from these divergent halos .",
    "astrophysically the density profile is expected to flatten at small radii where infalling objects can sweep out the centers of the halos through dynamical heating , although adiabatic accretion onto central baryonic density enhancements in the centers may create dark matter density enhancements @xcite .",
    "the annihilation rate is ultimately expected to limit the dm density @xcite .    as a reference and to clarify the units of the quantities involved , we derive the expression of the photon flux from wimp annihilation .",
    "consider a small emitting volume @xmath10 at a distance @xmath11 from a detector of collecting area @xmath12 ( orthogonal to the line of sight . )",
    "this volume subtends a solid angle @xmath13 as seen from the detector .",
    "let @xmath14 be the number of photons emitted during a time interval @xmath15 from the volume @xmath10 .",
    "assuming the emission is isotropic , a fraction @xmath16 of the emitted photons is detected .",
    "thus the number of detected photons in the same amount of time @xmath15 is @xmath17 specifically , for wimp annihilation ( @xmath18 ) , the number of photons emitted is @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the @xmath21-@xmath21 annihilation cross - section times relative velocity , @xmath22 is the wimp mass density , @xmath23 is the wimp mass , and @xmath24 is the number of photons in the energy interval @xmath25 $ ] produced per annihilation .",
    "the factor of @xmath26 is there because @xmath27 wimps are required per annihilation , @xmath28 is the number of wimps annihilating and @xmath24 is defined per annihilation .",
    "the photon flux from @xmath10 per unit energy at the detector then follows as @xmath29    when eq .",
    "( [ flux2 ] ) is integrated along the line of sight , @xmath10 can conveniently be written in terms of the solid angle @xmath13 as @xmath30 .",

    "( [ flux2 ] ) by the source distance and use cartesian coordinates centered at the source .",
    "we write the volume element @xmath50 where @xmath51 is along the line of sight and @xmath52 are transverse to the line of sight . to study the angular dependence of the signal , we integrate in @xmath51 only and introduce the angles @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "we give here three examples of wimps : the lightest neutralino in minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , the lightest neutralino in a generic minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and a kaluza - klein ( kk ) dark matter particle @xcite .",
    "to explore msugra models we used the program darksusy @xcite to find model parameters consistent with particle accelerator and direct search bounds .",
    "the spectrum of gamma rays extends up to @xmath62 tev and any wimp annihilation that would explain the observation would require a particle with a mass above @xmath63 tev . in msugra excessive thermal relic densities are predicted for most neutralinos with such a high mass .",

    "other processes , especially the acceleration of charged secondaries , could be reasonably expected to alter the spectrum @xcite .",
    "this could provide other signatures of the annihilation which could be an important check on the dm annihilation interpretation of the hess flux .",

    "we find that there is a family of msugra models that produce a neutralino with a mass of 10 to 11 tev consistent with current constraints and have a decent agreement with the hess spectrum , with a @xmath66 of @xmath8 1.2 .",
    "these models require the @xmath40 parameter to be in the range [ 300,3000 ] bubu to explain the flux observed by hess .",
    "lower values of @xmath40 may be obtained once the parameter space is relaxed beyond msugra .",
    "the difficulty in finding msugra models that fit the hess data lies in the excessive thermal relic densities predicted for neutralinos with the required mass , @xmath67 tev or higher .",
    "profumo @xcite has suggested that resonant annihilation of neutralinos through the a boson in the early universe , which can occur for @xmath68 , can lower the relic density for particles around 10 tev . in this case",

    "a possible explanation of the very high energy radiation from the galactic center is wimp annihilation .",
    "the intensity of the annihilation flux is a function of the density profile of dark matter in the galactic center .",
    "the angular distribution of detected gamma rays limits the size of the emission region .",
    "data on on the proper motions of stars and star counts around the galactic center constrain the size and the mass of the dark matter at the gc .",
    "we have shown that the density needed to produce the observed flux from wimp annihilation is consistent with observational constraints on the mass profile of the gc .",
    "for the stellar orbit data and the star counts , we used the infrared data in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found that these astronomical constraints on the source profile are comparable to and slightly stronger than the constraint from the angular distribution of photons measured by hess .",
    "there are several ways in which wimp annihilation as the origin of the hess flux could be confirmed or made implausible . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ rvsalpha ] , a slight improvement in either the gamma - ray angular resolution or the constraints from stellar orbits may reveal the presence of an extended dark matter annihilation region at the galactic center .",
    "an extended emission out to large angles would be a possible indication of wimp annihilation .",
    "an extended gamma - ray excess with the same spectrum and position of the gc flux has recently been reported by hess @xcite . a spectral cutoff at energies higher than the particle mass is another requirement of the dm hypothesis .",
    "the cutoff may be preceded by a gamma - ray line at the particle mass , but this spectral line does not appear to be observable with atmospheric cherenkov telescopes in the particle models we examined due to the insufficient energy resolution .",
    "absence of variability is another feature of wimp annihilation , thus variability of the source would be difficult to reconcile with the dm interpretation of the gc tev flux . finally , since the dark matter permeates our universe , if the same radiation was found in the centers of other mass concentrations , population studies may be possible that could help confirm or deny the annihilation nature of this radiation @xcite .",
    "a small spike on an nfw profile could explain the large gamma - ray flux which is not expected from cored or cusped halos . astrophysically small spikes in the dm halos are not favored , but not ruled out either . the infrared data of proper motions in the gc show about three million solar masses confined to a space of 90 au .",
    "the compression of this baryonic matter may adiabatically compress the dark matter and lead to such a spike in the profile @xcite .",
    "any merger events with larger stellar sized objects should dynamically heat the dm spike reducing its density .",
    "further observations of the galactic center in gamma rays are ongoing .",
    "there are hints that the tev radiation from the galactic ridge is connected to the galactic center point source .",
    "the tev flux from the gc seems to be constant in time and a cutoff in the spectrum ( now reported to have a spectrum with @xmath237 ) has not been found up to energies of @xmath238 tev @xcite , so the models considered here are still viable .",
