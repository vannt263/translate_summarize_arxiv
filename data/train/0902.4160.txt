    "to construct the hamiltonian comfortably , we firstly select three junction phases @xmath17 as the spatial variables and express the system hamiltonian in a sum of energy terms similar to other superconducting loop circuits such as the rf - qubit and the squid - qubit as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the charge operator conjugated with the phase @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 or @xmath46=2ei$ ] with @xmath47 the electronic charge ; @xmath48 is the josephson energy of the @xmath5th junction .",

    "this kind of understanding can be revealed by one well - known perturbation approach , the unitary transformation ( ut ) method@xcite , which introduces a specific unitary transformation @xmath140 , resembling a time - evolution operator , to rotate the hamiltonian @xmath141 into a new one @xmath142 so that it can be diagonalized as @xmath143 on an arbitrary order of @xmath49 .",

    "<S> an optimal effective current operator for flux qubit has been investigated by taking account of the inductive effects of the circuit loop . </S>",
    "<S> the whole system is treated as two interacting subsystems : one is the inductance - free flux qubit consisting of three josephson junctions and the other a high frequency lc - oscillator . as the composite system hardly affords one excessively high energy lc photon , an effective theory for the inductive flux qubit providing its physical variable operators has been achieved , which can take account of the inductive effects but does not include the additional degree of freedom for the lc - oscillator . considering the trade - off between simplicity and accuracy , it has been revealed that the optimal effective current operator resulting in an error only on the order of @xmath0 provides an approximation of high accuracy , which is also verified numerically . </S>"
