    "microlensing in the images of a multiply - imaged quasar was first reported by ( 1989 ) for the quadruple lens q2237 + 0305 ( huchra et  al .",
    "most quasar microlensing studies have been based on broad - band photometric monitoring ( e.g. , wo ' zniak et  al .",
    "2000 ; schechter et  al . 2003 ; colley & schild 2003 ) , which is sensitive primarily to variations in the continuum .",
    "microlensing of the continuum is expected since the optical / uv continuum emission is thought to originate in a region that is comparable in size to the einstein radius of a typical star in a typical lens galaxy .",
    "microlensing of the broad emission line region ( belr ) is also possible , if the belr has structure on scales comparable to the einstein radius of a star ( nemiroff 1988 ; schneider & wambsganss 1990 ) .",
    "the possibility of belr microlensing seemed rather remote until recent reverberation mapping work revised the estimate of the belr size downward from @xmath3 cm to @xmath4 cm ( wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ; kaspi et  al .",
    "inspired by these numbers , ( 2002 ) and & ibata ( 2003 ) revived the idea of looking for microlensing of the belr and computed possible line profile variations for various belr models .",
    "possible examples of microlensing of a quasar emission line have been presented by ( 1989 ) for q2237 + 0305 , and by ( 2003 ) for h1413 + 117 . in particular , ( 2003 ) detected a strong , redshifted fe k@xmath5 emission line in the x - ray spectrum of only one of the components in the quadruple lens h1413 + 117 .",
    "although they did not have multiple epochs to look for variability , ( 2003 ) invoked a short predicted time delay between the components to argue that microlensing is the preferred explanation for seeing the fe k@xmath5 line in only one component .    in this paper we present results from spectroscopic monitoring of the recently discovered quadruple lens sdss  j1004 + 4112 ( inada et al .",
    "2003 ; oguri et al .",
    "we observe variability in the broad emission line profiles of one of the lensed images that provides strong evidence for microlensing of the belr , suggesting that the theoretical predictions for microlensing were correct and confirming that the belr has structure on the scale of the einstein radius of a star .",
    "component b of sdss  j1004 + 4112 was first identified as a quasar by , wei , & hu ( 1999 ) and was also targeted as a quasar candidate ( richards et  al .",
    "2002 ) as part of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; 2000 ) ; the sdss spectrum was taken on 2003 february 3 and the object was identified as a @xmath2 quasar .",
    "component a was also identified as a possible quasar candidate based on its colors in the sdss imaging data ( fukugita et  al .",
    "1996 ; gunn et  al .",
    "1998 ) ; it was first confirmed as a quasar ( also at @xmath2 ) from observations taken on 2003 may 3 using the arc 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory .",
    "higher quality spectra of each of the four components and the lens galaxy were taken on 2003 may 31 with the lris ( oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) spectrograph on the keck i telescope at the w.  m.  keck observatory .",
    "these spectra are further described in ( 2003 ) , ( 2003 ) , and table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] gives the ut date of the observations , the telescope used , the components observed , the exposure time , the spectral dispersion , and the wavelength range covered .",
    "\\(2003 ) and ( 2003 ) noted that the keck / lris spectra showed that all four components had the same redshift and similar spectra , but there are some obvious differences  with component a showing the largest differences relative to the other components ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "specifically , component a has a much stronger blue emission line wing in the high - ionization lines ( / ] , , and ) .",
    "component b appears to have a slightly enhanced red wing as compared with the other three components . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we have sought to emphasize the differences in the emission line profile by subtracting a continuum fit between @xmath6    and @xmath7   , and then normalizing to the peak of emission .",
    "other choices in presentation could enhance or reduce the appearance of similarities and differences between the components .",
    "based on the puzzling differences in the broad emission line profiles of the four components of the keck / lris spectra , in 2003 november and 2003 december we obtained additional spectra of images a and b to monitor the differences ; see table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "we used the disiii spectrograph on the arc 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory , using the same instrument setup and data reduction for each epoch .",
    "the dispersion was @xmath8 and the spectra cover the range @xmath9@xmath10   .",
    "flux calibration was performed with respect to a hot standard star : either feige  34 or g  191-b2b .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed with respect to a helium - neon - argon comparison lamp . both components ( which are separated by @xmath11 )",
    "were observed at the same time in order to minimize any differences between them , at the expense of loss of spectrophotometric accuracy ( slit not positioned at the parallactic angle ) . at each epoch we took two spectra of either 40 or 45 minutes each .",
    "these spectra were extracted separately and then combined to yield 2003 november / december epoch spectra shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the 2d spectra are only moderately resolved , so we deblended the 2d spectra by fitting a double gaussian profile before extracting the spectra .",
    "we estimate that contamination of the faint component by the brighter component is less than 3% .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows all seven epochs of spectroscopic data for components a and b in the emission line region .",
    "the 2003 may 3 epoch observation of component a at apo confirms the reality of the excess emission in the blue wing of component a in the keck spectrum .",
    "the excess emission in spans a velocity range @xmath1225008500  km  s@xmath13 ( blueshifted ) . both and have excesses over a slightly higher velocity range .",
    "the excess in is much stronger in terms of equivalent width than that in .",
    "to argue that the excess in the blue wings of the high - ionization emission lines of component a is caused by microlensing of the belr , we must rule out alternative explanations . the first question is whether the flux enhancements are an artifact of the data acquisition or reduction procedures .",
    "we view this explanation as highly unlikely because the enhancement appeared at two different epochs , in spectra taken by different observers with different telescopes , and reduced independently .",
    "the second question is whether the spectral variations could be intrinsic to the quasar , rather than induced by lensing .",
    "if so , then the same variations should be seen in the other lensed images , offset in time by the lens time delays . while the time delays are still uncertain , in nearly all of the lens models presented by ( 2003 ) the delay between components a and b is predicted to be @xmath030 days .",
    "( the oguri et al .",
    "models do not form an exhaustive set , but the prediction of a short time delay between a and b is generic . ) in @xmath1210% of the models component a leads component b. in this case seeing the flux enhancement in the 2003 may 3 and 2003 may 31 spectra of component a but not in the 2003 may 31 spectrum of component b means that intrinsic variability can not explain the data . in the other @xmath1290% of the models component",
    "b leads component a. in this case , the intrinsic variability hypothesis would imply that the variations must have appeared in component b sometime after 2003 february 3 , been present during 2003 april ( in advance of the variations observed in component a in 2003 may ) , and then disappeared before 2003 may 31 . in other words ,",
    "the event must have lasted @xmath14117 days in the observed frame , or @xmath1443 days in the rest frame  and we were fortunate to catch the event in component a just before it disappeared .",
    "since the time separation of our spectral coverage does not completely rule out intrinsic variability , this issue deserves further discussion .",
    "specifically , we must address the likelihood of intrinsic variability of the belr on timescales of less than 43 days in the rest frame .",
    "reverberation timescales can be less than 43 days since the radius of the belr is likely to be on the order of or less than this size .",
    "however , in that case the entire emission line profile will vary with respect to any significant change in the continuum . since we do not observe a significant change in the continuum level ( see below ) and",
    "since the enhancement of the emission lines is only in the blue wing and not over the entire profile , a reverberation effect is unlikely .",
    "thus we are left with the possibility of a dynamical change  such as is seen in the so - called double - peaked emission line quasars ( e.g. , eracleous & halpern 2003 ; strateva et  al . 2003 )  which could better explain the blue - wing - only nature of the enhancement in the high - ionization emission lines .",
    "indeed the dynamical timescale ( @xmath15months ; 2003 ) can be in the range needed to explain our observations .",
    "however , double - peaked emission is typically only seen in the balmer lines ( and sometimes ) , and is absent or weak at best in high - ionization lines like and .",
    "furthermore , it would be very unusual for a double - peaked emission line object to show a blue - wing enhancement in both our 2003 may 3 and 2003 may 31 epochs , but no strong blue- or red - wing enhancement of our four 2003 november / december epochs .",
    "thus , although an explanation of the data in terms of intrinsic variability is not rigorously excluded , such a model would have to be rather improbably contrived .",
    "one possible objection to the microlensing hypothesis is if the belr was microlensed , why not the continuum as well ?",
    "it is difficult to put constraints on any enhancement of the continuum of component a relative to b during the time spanned by our observations , because not all of the spectra were taken at the parallactic angle .",
    "still , we can estimate that component a was no more than @xmath1220% brighter than b in the continuum in 2003 may ( as compared to 2003 november / december ) .",
    "this is not obviously inconsistent with the microlensing hypothesis , however .",
    "it is easy to imagine configurations in which part of the belr is close enough to the caustic in the source plane of a star in the lens to be microlensed , while the continuum source was far enough to feel little effect .",
    "in fact , this picture is consistent with our hypothesis that only _",
    "part _ of the belr was being microlensed in 2003 may ( see   [ sec : belr ] ) .",
    "another possible complication with the microlensing hypothesis is that cluster galaxies tend to be stripped of their halos through mergers and interactions .",
    "microlensing would therefore require either a cluster member very close to the line of sight to component a or a population of intracluster stars or massive compact halo objects ( machos ; e.g. , totani 2003 ; baltz et al .",
    "the presence of intracluster machos might not be surprising , because tidal forces would naturally strip machos from cluster galaxies along with the galaxy halos . on the other hand , there is evidence for a galaxy superimposed on component a that could host the microlensing object , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "proper psf subtraction to confirm this hypothesis is not possible since component a is saturated in this image , but our best efforts do reveal residual flux at the center of the circle in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] with an estimated magnitude of @xmath16 .",
    "we can also reverse the argument and ask if our microlensing hypothesis makes sense given our current understanding of the structure of quasars and the details of microlensing . without invoking detailed microlensing and belr models ( which would be premature since we have observed only one microlensing event ) , we still find that qualitative and quantitative arguments reveal good consistency between the microlensing hypothesis and the data .",
    "the scale for microlensing is given by the einstein radius of a star ( schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the einstein radius projected into the lens and source planes , respectively , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the angular diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "microlensing is said to occur at low optical depth if the mean separation between stars is @xmath23 and stars contribute a small fraction of the surface mass density , or at high optical depth if @xmath24 and stars contribute a substantial fraction of the surface mass density",
    ". the microlensing probability can be high even if the optical depth is low ( schechter & wambsganss 2002 ) . regardless of whether the optical depth is high or low",
    ", the einstein radius sets the characteristic scale , and the belr can be microlensed if it has structure on scales @xmath25 ( abajas et  al .",
    "2002 ; lewis & ibata 2003 ) .",
    "for sdss  j1004 + 4112 , the lens redshift is @xmath26 and the source redshift is @xmath27 , so the einstein radius of a @xmath28 star associated with the lensing cluster is @xmath29 in a cosmology with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the typical stellar einstein radius is indeed comparable to the currently favored size of the belr , and microlensing is not unexpected .",
    "the variability is caused by relative motion between the caustic network and the source .",
    "if the motion is dominated by the proper motion of the lens galaxy ( with transverse velocity @xmath33 ) , then the effective transverse velocity projected into the source plane and expressed in distance per unit observed - frame time is @xmath34 if the microlensing is dominated by caustic crossings , then the characteristic event duration is the time for the caustic to sweep across the source , @xmath35 . if we estimate @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the velocity dispersion of the lens , then @xmath38  km  s@xmath13 for the lensing cluster in sdss  j1004 + 4112 ( oguri et al .",
    "2003 ) yields @xmath39 the fact that we see variability in the broad emission lines on a time scale of @xmath126 months suggests either that we happened to catch the end of a long event , or that microlensing is affecting only part of the belr with a characteristic size smaller than @xmath40  cm ( or both ) .",
    "a second interesting time scale is the typical time between microlensing events .",
    "here the key unit is the time to cross an einstein radius , @xmath41 if even a few percent of the mass is in stars , microlensing is associated with a caustic network rather than a single star , and so naive estimates of the time between events are difficult . to obtain a better estimate ,",
    "we have used the standard ray shooting technique to compute microlensing magnification maps and generate sample light curves ( kayser , refsdal , & stabell 1986 ; wambsganss , paczynski , & katz 1990 ) .",
    "we find that starting from a non - microlensed position , the average wait time until the magnification changes by @xmath4230% is @xmath43 .",
    "the range represents uncertainties in the source size and in the number density of microlenses .",
    "although there are many uncertainties , it seems reasonable to expect that microlensing events could be observed in sdss  j1004 + 4112 on an approximately yearly basis .",
    "incidentally , if @xmath44 then microlensing events will blur together and the light curves will show continuous smooth variations ( see , e.g. , kochanek 2003 ) .",
    "the apparent lack of microlensing in the 2003 november / december epochs therefore adds further support to the hypothesis that the region being microlensed is smaller than @xmath4  cm .",
    "the microlensing hypothesis nicely explains one of the more interesting observational results , namely that different emission lines show different amounts of variability . from reverberation",
    "mapping results , we know that the belr is stratified by ionization and that higher ionization lines are found closer to the center ( peterson & wandel 1999 ) . as a result , the highest ionization regions have the smallest effective sizes and should be the most sensitive to microlensing .",
    "our finding that the excess in the line is stronger than the excess in the line ( in terms of equivalent width ) is consistent with their relative reverberation mapping sizes ( peterson & wandel 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a suggestion of a weaker excess in the blue wings of the ] /]//feiiiuv34 complex , , and uv48 ( a triplet at @xmath45 2062.211 , 2068.904 , 2079.652 ) ; see figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , and also the ratio spectra in figure  3 of ( 2003 ) .",
    "all the above lines are lower ionization lines than and , so their weaker excesses are also consistent with being more weakly microlensed as a result of their emitting regions being larger with respect to the projected eistein radius of the lens .",
    "an obvious question is why should microlensing of the belr be seen in this lens system , but not in others ?",
    "one possibility has to do with the quasar s intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the observed absolute @xmath46 magnitude of component a is @xmath47 , but this component is amplified by a factor of @xmath1220 or more , so the intrinsic absolute @xmath46 magnitude is @xmath48 .",
    "many other lensed quasars have similar observed magnitudes but smaller amplifications , and hence higher luminosities . since the size of the belr scales as the 0.50.7 power of the luminosity ( e.g. , kaspi et  al .",
    "2000 ) , sdss  j1004 + 4112 being relatively under - luminous would make it more sensitive to microlensing than many other lensed quasars .",
    "the large amplification helps make microlensing unsurprising in another way .",
    "large amplifications are associated with significant distortions that increase the size of the caustics ( see fig .  2 of & wambsganss 2002 ) .",
    "thus , with a given star field the microlensing probability increases as the amplification increases .",
    "this may explain not only why microlensing has been detected in sdss  j1004 + 4112 , but also why it was seen first in component a ( the highest - amplification component ) .      obtaining concrete constraints on the structure of",
    "the belr will require detailed modeling , and would greatly benefit from observations of additional microlensing events .",
    "nevertheless , combining the data in hand with general arguments already permits some strong and valuable conclusions . first , unless the number of clouds is orders of magnitude smaller than required by other high - resolution keck observations ( arav et  al .",
    "1998 ) , the asymmetric nature of the microlensing ( lensing of the blue wing only ) rules out a spherically symmetric distribution of dynamically virialized , thermal line - width clouds ( nemiroff 1988 ; abajas et  al . 2002 ; lewis & ibata 2003 ) .",
    "pure radial outflow models can be ruled out because they would produce symmetric line profile changes with most of the variation in the line core ( nemiroff 1988 ) .",
    "pure radial inflow models can not be fully excluded , but asymmetric microlensing would require the accretion disk to have a radial extent comparable to the radial extent of the belr and to be optically thick ( such that we do not see clouds at all velocities ) .",
    "the asymmetry therefore seems to imply that a strong rotational component is needed in the high - ionization region of the belr .",
    "such a component could come in the form of a pure keplerian disk or a rotating disk - wind ( e.g. , murray & chiang 1998 ; elvis 2000 ) .",
    "microlensing of the part of the belr that is rotating toward us would then easily explain the features that we observe .",
    "the most robust statement we can make is that the observations confirm that the belr has structure on the scale of the einstein radius .",
    "because we are sampling a region on the order of @xmath49  cm , we effectively have a `` telescope '' with a resolution of @xmath50  arcseconds ( given an angular diameter distance to the quasar of @xmath51  cm ) .",
    "in other words , in sdss  j1004 + 4112 , nature has provided us with an extremely powerful tool for the study of belr structure .",
    "the microlensing hypothesis leads to several predictions that may guide further observations .",
    "first , the nature of the object(s ) responsible for the microlensing is unknown .",
    "two obvious possibilities are stars or machos associated with a galaxy ( presumably a cluster member ) with a small projected impact parameters to component a , or stars or machos in the intracluster medium . while the subaru @xmath46-band image of the field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) suggests that there is indeed a galaxy near component a , the saturation of the quasar image makes psf subtraction uncertain .",
    "deep , high - resolution images , preferably in the near - ir , would better reveal whether this galaxy is real .",
    "if so , then the microlensing optical depth would be relatively high for component a and ( perhaps quite ) low for the other components , so further monitoring would probably reveal additional microlensing events in component a but not in the other components .    alternatively , if the microlensing is caused by intracluster stars or machos then the microlensing optical depth for component a is probably fairly low  but it is likely to be similar for the other components . in this case",
    "further monitoring could well reveal microlensing events in the other components , and the frequency of events would reveal the number density of intracluster objects .",
    "if additional microlensing events are detected , it will be extremely interesting to track which lines are microlensed as a function of time . that would provide a unique and powerful new probe of ionization stratification in the belr .",
    "in addition , the velocity dependence of any enhancements of the belr in future microlensing events will help to reveal the kinematic structure of the belr .",
    "in addition to the time - dependent differences in the blue wings of the high - ionization emission lines , there are also subtle differences in the emission line profiles between the components that persist over at least 322 days in the observed frame . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we have overplotted a gaussian at the position of emission to guide the eye and help illustrate these differences .    in particular , we note that there is a slight excess of high - velocity redshifted emission in component b as compared with component a. this excess is best seen in the 2003 may 31 keck spectra , where there is a kink in the profile of b near @xmath52    that is not present in component a. in addition , in all observations of component b the fall - off in the red wing toward @xmath53    is more gradual than in component a. we also see similar ( but opposite ) differences in the blue wing with the most extreme blue wing flux falling off more gradually in component a than in component b. in other words , at all epochs the emission line profile is somewhat blueward asymmetric in component a , and somewhat redward asymmetric in component b.    the cause of these differences is unclear . because the predicted a  b time delay is @xmath030 days , they are unlikely to be due to intrinsic variability ( unless the time delays are grossly underestimated ) .",
    "one interesting possibility is that they are also due to microlensing , but with a mass scale that is much larger than for the blue - wing belr microlensing discussed above ( in order to make the variability time scale longer than 322 days in the observed frame ) .",
    "the responsible objects could perhaps be globular clusters , or clumps of dark matter of mass @xmath54@xmath55 , in which case the phenomenon would be termed millilensing ( rather than microlensing ) and could provide a unique probe of dark matter substructure of the type predicted in the cold dark matter paradigm ( metcalf & madau 2001 ; dalal & kochanek 2002 ; wisotzki et  al .",
    "2003 ; metcalf et al .",
    "2003 ) .    one way to test the millilensing hypothesis would be to normalize the spectra using narrow lines since they should be insensitive to small - scale structure ( moustakas & metcalf 2003 ) .",
    "any differences in the broad lines would then indicate millilensing .",
    "this might be possible with either j - band ir spectra of [ ] @xmath56 or with the unusually strong ( but not apparently microlensed ) nitrogen lines seen in our optical spectra , since the nitrogen lines appear relatively narrow and may lack a broad component .",
    "we have presented seven epochs of spectroscopic data on the two brightest components of the wide - separation , quadruply imaged quasar sdss j1004 + 4112 .",
    "although the simplest lensing scenarios predict that the four components should have identical spectra , the data reveal significant differences in the emission line profiles of the components .",
    "in particular , the emission line profile in components a and b show both variable differences and differences that are constant over 322 observed - frame days .",
    "the and / ] lines in component a also show variability similar to that seen in the line .",
    "because the predicted time delay between a and b is @xmath030 days , we argue that the differences are not due to intrinsic variability in the quasar coupled with a lensing time delay . instead , we suggest that the variability in the blue wing of component a is best explained by microlensing of part of the broad emission line region , resolving belr structure on the order of a few light days .",
    "this represents the first robust detection of belr microlensing , with evidence based on multiple emission lines and involving observed variability .",
    "the nature of the time - independent differences is less clear , but they may also be the result of a lensing event . in any case , it is clear that continued spectroscopic monitoring of sdss  j1004 + 4112 should be carried out in an attempt to map the structure of its broad emission line region through additional microlensing events .",
