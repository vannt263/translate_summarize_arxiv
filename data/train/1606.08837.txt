    "schrdinger equation is certainly one of the cornerstones of theoretical physics.@xcite this equation is the core equation of quantum mechanics , and it can be considered as the analogue of newton s second law of classical mechanics .",
    "it is the starting point for every quantum mechanical system we want to describe : electrons , atoms , whatever .",
    "thus , the search for exactly solvable and integrable potentials of this equation has a great significance , because the qualitative understanding of a complicated realistic system can be acquired by analysing exactly solvable simplified models that still retain the essential features of the physical system under investigation .",
    "we point out that by exactly solvable model we mean that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation can be given in an explicit and closed form.@xcite    several methods and techniques have been developed during the last decades to exactly solve the schrdinger equation or to obtain approximate analytical solutions , with the aim to get better understanding of its dynamical behaviour.@xcite despite all the efforts that have been done , the exact solutions of that equation are limited to a small set of special potentials such as , for instance , the ones considered in the well - known problems of the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom . when periodic potentials are concerned , the situation is even worse .",
    "indeed , the general analysis of the electronic levels in a periodic potential , independently of its form , can be successfully carried out only in one dimension .",
    "although the one dimensional case is in many respects atypical or irrelevant , some of the features of the three dimensional band structure may be described through approximate calculations emerging from an exact treatment in one dimension .",
    "also in this case , one is able to carry out an exact calculation of the allowed and forbidden bands for very special models as the dirac comb or the kronig - penney model.@xcite thus , it would be valuable to investigate more general and realistic potentials even though one usually does this job by approximate methods based on elementary perturbation theory . routinely , one considers the weak and tight binding approximations starting out , in the first case , with the wave function for a free electron , and in the other one with the wave function of an electron bound to an atom .",
    "recently , the concept of supersymmetry ( susy ) has been profitably applied to many non - relativistic quantum mechanical problems , paving a route to enlarge the class of exactly solvable schrdinger equations.@xcite in particular , there is now a much deeper understanding of why schrdinger equation with certain potentials may be analytically solved and several powerful new approximate methods have been formulated for handling potentials which are not exactly solvable . in particular , the exact solution of the schrdinger equation for solvable potentials can be understood in terms of few basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials , shape invariance and operator transformations.@xcite for completeness , we notice that standard textbook solvable potentials all exhibit the property of shape invariance.@xcite in the case of periodic potentials , the supersymmetric properties slightly change compared to then strategy adopted for ordinary potentials,@xcite the main difference being related to the finiteness of the domain of the potential .",
    "indeed , in this case the potentials indefinitely repeated , so that one can try to solve the schrdinger equation considering potentials whose shape looks more realistic than the dirac comb or the kronig - penney potential . the aim of this paper is to present an exact solution of the schrdinger equation for a periodic pschl - teller potential , showing that the susy concept turns out an useful and powerful tool helping us to find out the solution of this equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start by introducing , in sec .",
    "ii , the general properties of the susy within the quantum mechanics realm , pointing out important concepts such as hamiltonian hierarchy and shape invariance . in sec .",
    "iii , we present and discuss the exact solution of the schrdinger equation for a periodic pschl - teller potential .",
    "iv is devoted to final remarks and conclusions .",
    "let us consider a time independent , one dimensional , quantum system described by an hamiltonian @xmath0.@xcite without loss of generality , we can suppose that the ground state of the system has zero energy .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the ground state is @xmath1    then , let us suppose that there exist two operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 that factorize @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath4 in this case , the following operators @xmath5 @xmath6 reproduce @xmath0 , provided that @xmath7 is a real function such that @xmath8 we notice that , changing the order of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we get a new hamiltonian operator @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath0 and @xmath9 are called supersymmetric partners .",
    "now , let us discuss the properties of these hamiltonians . to this end , in the following we will denote by @xmath11 @xmath12 the @xmath13-th eigenvector ( eigenvalue ) of the the hamiltonian @xmath14 . + first of all",
    ", it can be trivially shown that both hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath9 admit a set of non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "indeed , @xmath15 and @xmath16    moreover , at most one of the supersymmetric partners exhibits a normalized zero energy ground state .",
    "this conclusion stems from eqs.([eq:7]-[eq:8 ] ) and the definition of the operator @xmath2 implying that @xmath17    @xmath18    thus , at least one of the two lowest energy eigenstates is not normalizable .    finally , the two hamiltonians have almost identical energy spectrum , apart from possibly the zero energy level .",
    "indeed , applying @xmath2 @xmath19 to an eigenvector of @xmath20 one gets an eigenvector of @xmath21 , associated with the the same eigenvalue : @xmath22 obviously , this is true unless @xmath23 is zero .",
    "therefore , two scenarios are possible : broken and unbroken susy : when the two energy spectra are identical susy is broken , otherwise they differ for the ground state energy and susy is unbroken .    in the case of unbroken susy",
    ", we can go further factorizing @xmath9 by means of the operator @xmath24 and its adjoint such that @xmath25 in this way , we may get a new hamiltonian , as previously done to define @xmath9 : @xmath26 iterating this procedure we may finally write down @xmath27 as follows @xmath28 summarizing , starting from an hamiltonian having @xmath13 bound states , we can introduce a chain of @xmath13 hamiltonians such that @xmath14 and @xmath29 have an energy spectrum almost identical , apart from the absence of the ground state of @xmath29 within the energy eigenvalues of @xmath14 .",

    "the quantum mechanical problem can be easily solved . indeed , using the following equation    @xmath36    one may iterate the procedure , getting the @xmath13-th hamiltonian :    @xmath37    we can show that the ground state of @xmath27 is @xmath38 , and its energy is @xmath39 .",
    "indeed ,    @xmath40    trivially proving our claim .",
    "we want to stress that the ground state energy of @xmath27 is equal to the @xmath13-th excited level of @xmath0 , implying that the energy spectrum of @xmath41 is given as follows :    @xmath42    furthermore , we can use eq.([hamhie ] ) to find out the corresponding eigenstates in the following way :    @xmath43",
    "in this section we will get the energy spectrum for periodic pschl and teller potential . to this end",
    ", we will firstly show how the schrdinger equation may be exactly solved for non - periodic pschl and teller potential , and then , taking advantage from this solution , we will present the solution for the periodic case .",
    "the pschl and teller potential is given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we point out that this potential has been introduced by pschl and teller to study the vibrational spectra of polyatomic molecules.@xcite for completeness , we would like to stress that the schrdinger equation with the potential of eq.(22 ) can be exactly solved also for @xmath47.@xcite    although the susy allows for an exact solution of the schrdinger equation only for the special case of integer values of @xmath48 , it has the advantage that the solution of this equation may be easily derived and worked with .",
    "+ to find out an explicit solution , we start considering a function @xmath49 of the form :    @xmath50    with the supersymmetric partners @xmath31 and @xmath51 given by :    @xmath52    @xmath53    we notice that the shape invariance condition eq.(16 ) is satisfied when @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . + moreover , since the potential @xmath57 is a constant , the energy spectrum of @xmath58 is made of @xmath48 bound states , followed by a continuum spectrum for energy values greater than @xmath59 .",
    "+ according to eq .",
    "the values of the energy of the bound states of @xmath58 are obtained as    @xmath60    so that the energy spectrum of @xmath61 may be easily obtained shifting this spectrum by @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath63 while the continuum part of the spectrum is simply given by non negative energies @xmath64 . +      taking advantage of the results of the previous section",
    ", we now study the periodic case considering the potential given in eq.(22 ) for the special case @xmath65 , as plotted in fig.2 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "looking at the plot , we may observe that , when the motion of a particle in a one - dimensional lattice is concerned , its shape appears more realistic than , for instance , the dirac comb or the kronig - penney potential .",

    "before , the function @xmath49 has the form @xmath71    so that we have : @xmath72 and @xmath73    since the eigenfunction of the model hamiltonian with @xmath74 are the free particle eigenfunctions , as previously stated , the eigenfunctions of the model hamiltonian with @xmath61 given in eq .",
    "( 28 ) can be obtained applying to the free particle eigenfunctions the following operator : @xmath75 when @xmath64 we get    @xmath76    where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the free particle eigenfunctions .",
    "for @xmath79 the eigenfunctions may be easily obtained replacing the trigonometric functions with the corresponding hyperbolic ones :    @xmath80+\\\\ & + \\alpha\\tanh(\\alpha x)\\ , \\left[b\\cosh(kx)+c\\sinh(kx)\\right]\\ , , \\end{alignedat}\\ ] ]    where @xmath81    we want to stress that the normalization constant of the eigenfunctions is not relevant since the constraints on @xmath82 , imposed by the continuity of @xmath83 and its derivative , are independent of the normalization constant .    applying the bloch theorem : @xmath84 and considering that @xmath85 we may straightforwardly determine the energy bands .",
    "the calculation is quite tedious ; details on this procedure are reported in the appendix .    to get the energy bands we have to solve the transcendental equation @xmath86    , @xmath64 , and for @xmath87    let us first discuss the case @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "+ in fig.([band1 ] ) we have plotted the function @xmath88 , given in eq . ( a6 ) , choosing @xmath89 . for this particular choice of @xmath90 , we observe some energy gaps in the energy region where the function @xmath88 is either greater than 1 or smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , apart from the first gap , the other forbidden regions are very small and they may be seen only by zooming in the figure . for completeness , we notice that the shape of the function does not change significantly varying @xmath90 , i. e. only the first gap region may increase or decrease , eventually disappearing , when @xmath90 is changed .",
    "besides , we do not observe qualitative variations when @xmath48 increases . in conclusion , even though the shape of this potential may appear more realistic than , for instance , the dirac comb , for the latter the band structure is more rich and the energy band and the corresponding gaps look more realistic.@xcite    let us now study the case @xmath79 . + in fig.([band2 ] ) we plot the function @xmath88 for @xmath65 and for different values of the parameter @xmath90 , namely @xmath90=1 , 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 .",
    ", @xmath79 , and @xmath90=1 , 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 , from left to right . ]        in this case , as stressed in the previous section for the non - periodic pschl - teller potential , the model hamiltonian exhibits only one bound state corresponding to the energy eigenvalue @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath90 increases , all the pschl - teller wells are separated from each other and the energy level of the periodic case is almost equal to the non periodic case leading to @xmath93 . on the other hand , for small values of @xmath90 , the potential wells overlap and the energy levels split into a band . in this case and for @xmath94",
    ", the solution of the schrdinger equation would support more than one band .",
    "for instance , for larger values of @xmath48 , namely @xmath95 , we find two different bands as shown in fig.([band3 ] ) .",
    "also in this case , the bands are centred at the value corresponding to the energy level of the non periodic case and , for larger values of @xmath90 , the bands shrink into single levels .",
    "in this paper we have applied a method which , making use of susy combined with bloch theorem , allows to solve the schrdinger equation for a realistic periodic potential .",
    "we have applied this procdure to the periodic pschl - teller well , explicitly calculating the energy spectrum and the band structure .",
    "we have presented the results for both positive and negative energies and we have discussed the results obtained .",
    "we point out that the method we have presented turns out to be very efficient and flexible so that it may be applied to other realistic periodic potentials .",
    "we would also like to stress that there are other ways to apply susy to the solution of the schrdinger equation in the presence of periodic potentials .",
    "indeed , it is possible to start from a problem whose band structure is known and find out another potential having the same energy spectrum .",
    "for instance , it may be easily shown that the repulsive periodic dirac comb with pschl - teller wells between the dirac deltas has the same band structure of an attractive periodic dirac comb potential.@xcite this not trivial conclusion may be inferred simply finding the superpotential that connects the two potentials .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    as discussed in the text , we start from the eigenfuntion @xmath96 as reported in eq.(33 ) : @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
