    "in the pursuit of obtaining a comprehensive understanding of star formation in our galaxy , the formation of stars with masses greater than 10  m@xmath2 remains a challenging problem .",
    "it has become well established that massive stars form not in isolation , but in close proximity to others stars spanning the entire range of the initial mass function .",
    "observationally , the gregarious nature of massive star formation has been established on three hierarchical levels . on the largest spatial scales ,",
    "young massive stars are almost always found in clusters , with sizes around 0.5 pc @xcite .",
    "the more relevant scale for the formation of high - mass stars is that of a few thousand au . on these spatial scales ,",
    "massive stars are often found to be part of multiple systems and trapezia .",
    "trapezia , defined as non - hierarchical ( and consequently , unstable ) multiple system , are commonly found within ob - associations and open clusters @xcite .",
    "multiplicity around high - mass stars continues to even smaller separations ; spectroscopic observations of massive stars show companions with separations of 10 au or less @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether ob stars form in these multiple systems , or whether the multiple systems are formed from subsequent dynamical interactions in the dense centers of young stellar clusters @xcite . to date , the known examples of ob stars in multiple systems have already cleared their natal gas . if ob stars form with companions at separations ranging from a few au to 1000 au , then these companions may play important role in mediating accretion onto ob stars by modifying accretion disks and envelopes , by adding extra mass to the system @xcite , or through mergers @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it is essential to search for companions of forming massive stars at the highest available angular resolution .",
    "a rare example of a binary high - mass protostellar system is w3 irs 5 , at a distance of 1.8 kpc @xcite .",
    "this infrared source was first resolved into a double infrared source by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the total luminosity is @xmath4  l@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "radio observations with the very large array by @xcite and @xcite show that each component of the infrared source is coincident with radio continuum source with sizes @xmath5  au .",
    "these _ hypercompact _ hii regions are perhaps the youngest detectable stage of a massive star",
    ". the w3  irs  5 region is also the source of at least two outflows @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the w3  irs  5 cluster is in the center of an embedded cluster of 80 - 240 low mass stars .",
    "we report here hst nicmos observations of w3 irs 5 with an angular resolution of @xmath6 .",
    "the observations were taken in cycle 7 using camera 2 of nicmos onboard the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "a @xmath7 map was made using a spiral - dither pattern with two dithers at each map position .",
    "the multiaccum mode was used with a total integration time of 128  sec for each image .",
    "the images were take in the f110w , f160w and f222 m filters .",
    "the data were reduced with the standard stsci pipeline .",
    "the frames were then registered and mosaiced using a custom program written in idl .",
    "photometry was obtained through a combination of aperture photometry and point spread function ( psf ) fitting .",
    "the psf was generated with the tinytim program @xcite . using a custom idl program",
    ", we fit the psf to five point sources in the f222 m mosaic : nir1 , nir2 , nir2a , nir2b and nir4 ( see table  1 ) . for nir2 ,",
    "nir2a and nir2b , which are separated by less than @xmath3 , we fit three psfs simultaneously .",
    "we also fit psfs to five isolated point sources in the f222 m mosaic and measured the photometric offset between the psf fitting and the aperture photometry .",
    "we used aperture photometry for the remaining point sources in the f222 m and f160w mosaics , including the more isolated nir3 and nir5 sources .",
    "the total count rates were measured over a @xmath8 pixel aperture with a @xmath9 to @xmath10 pixel sky radius . to determine magnitudes we used the equation @xmath11 , where cr is the count rate in dn  sec@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14  jy  s  dn@xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath16  jy , and `` corr '' , the aperture correction , is @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the f160w and f222 m bands , respectively .",
    "the coefficients are the cycle 7 values taken from the online nicmos data handbook , the aperture corrections were measured from the data .",
    "the resulting zero points for the count rate were 19.40 and 21.22 for the f222 m and f160w bands .",
    "in the center of the w3 irs  5 cluster is a small group of red objects , the most prominent of which is the double near - ir source irs  5 ( figures  1 and 2 ) . in figure  1 , we use lower limits to the colors of sources undetected at f160w by adopting the @xmath19 detection limit of @xmath20  mag . within a region",
    "less than @xmath21 in diameter , there are three sources with @xmath22-[f222 ] > 4 $ ] , and two additional sources which have colors @xmath22-[f222 ] > 2 $ ] .",
    "we designate these sources nir @xmath23 .",
    "the five sources are coincident with a dense clump of molecular gas , with a mass of 100  m@xmath2 and fwhm diameter of @xmath24 or @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "@xcite measure a column density of @xmath26  @xmath27 toward this region with an @xmath28 beam ; the extinction through this clump in the f222 m band is 60  magnitudes @xcite .",
    "consequently , we find it highly unlikely that the detected stars are background stars",
    ".    images of the w3 irs 5 system in the f160w and f222 m filter are shown in figure  3 .",
    "@xcite found that the two brightest infrared sources , nir1 and nir2 , are coincident with hypercompact hii regions @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "these were detected in the mid - ir by @xcite .",
    "nir3 was also detected in the radio continuum and mid - ir by @xcite . to the east , there are two additional sources , nir4 and nir5 , which were not detected in the radio or mid - ir . in panel c , we show the same image with the two hypercompact hii regions subtracted using a psf generated with tiny tim @xcite .",
    "the subtracted image reveals two point sources near source nir2 ; these are separated from nir2 by @xmath31 and @xmath3 .",
    "we designate these sources nir2a and nir2b . in between nir1 and nir2",
    "we find an elongated nebulosity .    in table 1",
    "we give the properties of the seven unresolved sources in this region .",
    "the coordinates were shifted so that nir1 has the same position as the @xmath29 source in @xcite .",
    "only two sources were marginally detected in the f160 m band , nir1 and nir4 .",

    "nir4 does not have a detected hii region , suggesting that either the emission is quenched by a high accretion rate @xcite , that the star is not hot enough to produce significant lyman continuum radiation , or that nir4 is a background star - which is unlikely given the high extinction . using the the tentative f160w detection",
    ", nir4 has a color of @xmath36 . assuming that the emission from nir4 is from a hot photosphere with no contribution from circumstellar dust , implying an intrinsic color of @xmath37 , and adopting a reddening law of @xmath38 @xcite and a distance modulus of 11.23",
    ", we derive an absolute f222 m magnitude of @xmath39 . using the tabulation of @xmath40-band magnitudes vs mass for zams ob stars in @xcite",
    ", this magnitude corresponds to a spectral type b0.5v and a mass of 11  @xmath41 .",
    "the lack of radio emission suggests that the star has a later spectral type than b0.5 , and it is likely that nir4 is a later type star undergoing pre - main sequence evolution .",
    "for example , the herbig ae / be star bd+65  1637 , which has a spectal type of b3 and a mass of 9.5  m@xmath2 , has a dereddened absolute @xmath40-band magnitude of @xmath42 , similar to the of nir4 @xcite .",
    "the lyman continuum flux of a b3 star is 3% that of a b1 star @xcite . for nir5",
    "there is only a lower limit to the measured color , @xmath43 .",
    "assuming an intrinsic color of @xmath44 ( i.e. equal to the @xmath45 color with an m3 dwarf @xcite ) , the resulting absolute magnitudes in the f222 m band is @xmath46 , corresponding to masses @xmath47 and @xmath48  m@xmath2 for ages of 0.1  myr and 1  myr respectively @xcite .",
    "this source is probably a low mass star .",
    "the two remaining point sources are found within a projected distance of 800 au of nir2 ; given their proximity to nir2 and their red colors , we find it likely that these are stellar companions to nir2 .",
    "neither of these sources would be resolved in the mid - ir imaging of @xcite , but they would be resolved in vla radio observations of this region .",
    "we see no radio counterpart to the fainter source , nir2b , this source has the same magnitude as nir5 and is probably a low mass star .",
    "nir2a is directly between the radio sources @xmath30 and @xmath49 .",
    "if the 2.22  @xmath0 m emission from nir2a is pure photospheric emission from an embedded star , the star would have to be quite massive ; the upper limit of the dereddened f222 m magnitude is equivalent to that of a zams o8.5 star @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the two sources are unresolved knots of shocked h@xmath50 from a bipolar flow originating from nir2 .",
    "@xcite argued that nir2/radio source @xmath30 was driving an outflow in a roughly north - south direction ; as shown in figure 3 , the two features are relatively aligned with the flow .",
    "these two explanations can be tested through narrow - band images in the h@xmath50 @xmath51 s(1 ) line .",
    "we also report the first detection of a compact nebula between the nir1 and nir2 .",
    "the nebula may result from the collision of outflows from nir1 and nir2 , or from the collision of an outflow from one source with the envelope of the other .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find evidence for a ionized knot moving from nir1 at 100  km  s@xmath12 which may be part of an outflow moving to the north - east . if the proposed outflow is bipolar and centered on nir1 , the counter - flow would be moving to the south - west in the direction of nir2 .",
    "observations of @xcite showed a radio source between nir1 and nir2 , @xmath52 , which was not detected in subsequent vla imaging .",
    "@xcite argue that these transient radio sources are created in outflows , in this case @xmath52 may tracing the outflow responsible for the observed near - ir nebula .",
    "we speculate that the x - rays detected by @xcite toward w3  irs5 may originate in this nebula",
    ".      could w3  irs  5 be a precursor to a trapezium still embedded in its natal gas ?",
    "trapezia are defined as non - hierarchical multiple system of three or more stars ; @xcite proposed that as a working rule for identifying trapezia , the largest projected separation should be no more than three times the smallest projected separation .",
    "the separations between the five near - ir sources ranges between 5600 au and 1800 au and roughly satisfy this criteria . at smaller separations , the detection of candidate companions around nir2 provides the first evidence for multiplicity at separations @xmath53 au around high - mass protostars .",
    "companions with separations ranging from 460  au to 16 au have been detected toward the ob stars composing the orion nebula trapezium system @xcite .",
    "hence , the spatial distribution of the primaries , and the presence of companions is similar to that observed in other trapezium system .",
    "the maximum projected separation of the five near - ir sources is 5600 au , compared to 10000 au for the trapezium in the orion nebula .",
    "@xcite identified fourteen likely trapezia , the median radius to the furthest outlying member of these trapezia is 40000 au .",
    "hence , the projected separations in the w3  irs  5 system are smaller than those observed in optically visible trapezia .",
    "the stellar surface density of the five near - ir sources composing the w3  irs  5 trapezia is 10000  pc@xmath54 , four times the density in the surrounding cluster - which is 2600  pc@xmath54 for a cluster radius of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the small size of the w3  irs  5 system may be a function of its youth ; such systems may expand as the natal gas is expelled from the system by outflows and radiation .",
    "maps of the molecular gas show a compact core of dense gas surrounding the w3 irs 5 with a mass of @xmath56  @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the lyman - continuum fluxes required by the observed radio continuum fluxes imply spectral types of b0.5 for the stars associated with nir1 , nir2 and nir4 @xcite . since the radio continuum measurements suffer from a high optical depth ,",
    "this is a lower limit .",
    "a b0.5 star has a mass around 18  m@xmath2 @xcite , this gives a lower limit to the combined stellar mass of 54  m@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite found that the star formation efficiency , i.e. the ratio to the stellar mass to the total stellar and gas mass is about @xmath57 in the w3  irs  5 cluster .",
    "however , in the irs  5 system , the stellar mass appears to be @xmath58 of the total mass .",
    "this high star formation efficiency may allow trapezia to survive the dispersal of the natal gas and emerge as bound systems within a larger cluster .",
