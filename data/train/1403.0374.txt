    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are believed to arise from the deaths of massive stars or the coalescence of two compact stellar objects such as neutron stars or black holes .",
    "the resulting explosion gives rise to an expanding fireball with a jet pointed at the observer but hidden from the observer until the density of radiation and particles in this highly relativistic outflow is low enough for radiation to escape , a region called the photosphere ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "while the emission from this fireball is expected to be thermal @xcite , observations over the past three decades suggest the prompt emission to be highly non - thermal @xcite , with only a few exceptions @xcite .",
    "the conversion of the fireball energy into non - thermal @xmath1-ray radiation involves the acceleration of electrons in the outflow and their subsequent cooling via an emission process such as synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "insight into these energy radiation emission processes in grbs is obtained by comparing the observed @xmath1-ray photon spectra directly to different radiation models .",
    "the @xmath0 gamma - ray space telescope offers a broad energy range for these comparisons .",
    "recent observations @xcite show that at least two mechanisms can be present : a non - thermal component that is consistent with synchrotron emission from accelerated electrons in the jet and a typically smaller blackbody contribution from the photosphere .",
    "this photospheric emission is released when the fireball becomes optically thin so that an observer may see a mixture of thermal and non - thermal emission with different temporal characteristics that , when viewed together , can probe the development and structure of the fireball jet .",
    "this simple photospheric model has been used to quantitatively interpret several observed correlations such as the amati correlation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    we are thus motivated to investigate correlations among spectral parameters derived by fitting the non - thermal component with a synchrotron photon model and the thermal component with a blackbody , an approach developed in previous investigations @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron model consists of an accelerated electron distribution , containing a relativistic maxwellian and a high - energy power law tail that is convolved with the standard synchrotron kernel @xcite .",
    "we find that the characteristic energies ( @xmath2 for synchrotron and @xmath3 for the blackbody ) of the synchrotron and blackbody components are highly correlated across all the grbs in our sample .",
    "we show that this correlation can be used to address the key question of how the energy of the outflow is distributed , i.e. , whether the energy is in a magnetic field or is imparted as kinetic energy to baryons in the jet , and how this energy distribution evolves with time .",
    "the @xmath0 gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) @xcite has detected more than 1200 grbs since the start of operations on 2008 , july 14 .",
    "a smaller number have been seen by the @xmath0 large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite at energies",
    "greater than 100 mev , but these are particularly interesting because they are among the brightest grbs and offer the greatest opportunity for spectral analysis across a broad energy range .",
    "grbs can last from a few milliseconds to hundreds of seconds or longer and have a variety of temporal profiles , from single spikes to multi - episodic overlapping pulses .",
    "single - pulse grbs exhibit the simplest spectral evolution , providing the `` cleanest '' signal for fitting physical models to the data @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze six bright , single - pulse grbs detected by @xmath0 ( see table [ tab : tab1 ] and figure [ fig : lcs ] ) and find correlations between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 values within each of these grbs .",
    "the grbs in our sample are grb 081224a @xcite , grb 090719a @xcite , grb 100707a @xcite , grb 110721a @xcite , grb 110920a , grb 130427a @xcite .",
    "the time histories of these grbs are shown in figure [ fig : lcs ] , with vertical dotted lines indicating the time binning used for the analysis of the spectral evolution of each spectral component . in a previous analysis @xcite , the viability of fitting physical models to the @xmath0 grb data was demonstrated for several grbs and the spectral evolution of these models over the burst durations was investigated .",
    "the synchrotron model of @xcite , was constructed by convolving a shock - accelerated electron distribution of the form @xmath6 with the standard synchrotron kernel @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath7 normalizes the distribution to total number or energy , @xmath1 is the electron lorentz factor in the fluid frame , @xmath8 is the thermal electron lorentz factor , @xmath9 is the minimum electron lorentz factor of the power - law tail , @xmath10 is the normalization of the power - law , and @xmath11 is the electron spectral index . the function @xmath12 is a step function where @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "these fits were found to be as good as those made with the empirical band function @xcite that is the common choice for grb spectroscopy .",
    "however , the band function , being empirical , makes it difficult to deduce a more physical understanding .",
    "the fits with synchrotron model provide a direct association of the observed spectrum with a physical emission mechanism and therefore the fit parameters can be used to study properties of the grb jet without ambiguity .",
    "all of these grbs were shown to be consistent with a physical model containing both a synchrotron and a blackbody component . for five of those grbs",
    "we investigate herein correlations between the previously derived @xmath2 and @xmath3 values , and we add to our sample the first pulse of the ultra - bright burst , grb 130427a , for which a similar analysis has been performed @xcite .",
    "grb 130427a is the brightest grb detected by @xmath0 to date .",
    "although its temporal structure is complex @xcite , it begins with a bright single pulse that is ideal for our physical modeling , which was used to show that internal shocks can not explain the observed emission @xcite .",
    "grb 081224a , grb 110721a , and grb 130427a were analyzed with gbm and lat data ; the rest of the sample were analyzed with gbm data alone .",
    "while this sample is limited by the number of bright , single - pulsed grbs in the @xmath0 data set , this requirement allows reliable interpretation of the fits without confusion from overlapping pulses with different underlying spectra , which is essential to measuring the evolution of the thermal and non - thermal components throughout the duration of the grb .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] shows an example of the spectral evolution of the two separate components .",
    "a strong correlation is found between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as illustrated in figures [ fig : cors ] & [ fig : allc ] .",
    "a power law of the form @xmath17 was fit to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 pairs of the individual grbs yielding values of @xmath5 ranging from  @xmath181 to 2 ( see table [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "the general temporal trend of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 is an evolution from higher to lower energies .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : spec ] , the evolution of the flux of each component is not necessarily tied to the change in the characteristic energies .",
    "this is very evident during the rise phase of a pulse during which the flux rises while @xmath2 and @xmath3 fall with time .",
    "however , during the decay phase of the pulse , the flux decreases along with the characteristic energies .",
    "table [ tab : tab1 ] lists the ratio of the blackbody flux to the total flux for each burst .",
    "in this scenario , the jet dynamics are parameterized by the dependence of the bulk lorentz factor on the radius as @xmath19 , from its initial launching radius of @xmath20 until the jet reaches its coasting lorentz factor @xmath21 at the so - called saturation radius @xmath22 , where l is the luminosity and @xmath23 is the mass outflow rate",
    ". this will be approximately the jet s lorentz factor until it is decelerated upon collision with the surrounding medium . for magnetically - dominated jets @xmath24 @xcite , and in the baryonic case @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "intermediate values correspond to a mix of these components @xcite , and can be further modified by factors such as the topology of the magnetic field .    under these assumptions",
    ", there are two regions of interest for which we can define the radial evolution of the bulk lorentz factor : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 and is clearly larger when the jet is magnetically dominated .",
    "the emission of the blackbody is assumed to originate at the photospheric radius ( @xmath28 ) , where the optical depth of the jet drops to unity . following @xcite , the photospheric radius is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the lorentz factor of the outflow at @xmath28 .",
    "the value of @xmath30 depends on the magnetic content of the outflow ; therefore , @xmath28 can take on two values,@xmath31 the introduction of the critical lorentz factor , @xmath32 provides an important discriminator for the location of the @xmath33 relative to @xmath22 .",
    "outflows with @xmath34 have their photospheres at the saturation radius",
    ". typical observed lorentz factors of grbs derived via different methods indicate values of a few hundred @xcite . in a magnetically dominated ( @xmath35 ) case , we have @xmath36 . for physically relevant values of @xmath37 erg s@xmath38 and @xmath39 cm ,",
    "@xmath40 is low compared to observed values for @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the photosphere is in the acceleration phase for a large segment of the parameter space . on the other hand , in baryonic cases ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 , which is several orders of magnitude higher than observed lorentz factors .",
    "therefore , we assume that magnetically dominated jets have their photospheres in the acceleration phase and baryonically dominated jets have their photospheres in the coasting phase . with this critical assumption , we derive two cases for the behaviors of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "close above the photosphere , instabilities in the flow or magnetic field line reconnection can lead to mildly relativistic shocks and accelerate leptons , which in turn emit synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the evolution of the photosphere s luminosity or lorentz factor , or some combination of both , drives the evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "one natural assumption is that the evolution of the photosphere s luminosity results in the observed variations in @xmath2 and @xmath44 as a burst proceeds .",
    "therefore , considering the two types of jets ; magnetically dominated ( @xmath45 ) and kinetic dominated ( @xmath46 ) we have two possibilities for the values of @xmath5 :    * , considering the appropriate powers of @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 . the exponent is singular at @xmath49 , but for values up to @xmath50 ( these are the values of @xmath51 for which the photosphere will occur in the acceleration phase ) we are able to explain values of @xmath5 from 2 down to 1.4 * case we have @xmath52 .",
    "this is observed in some grbs .",
    "the analysis of grbs in the framework of this model can indicate whether the photosphere is in the acceleration or coasting phase , which in turn can be translated to the composition of the jet .",
    "we find that for exponents close to 2 the jet dynamics are dominated by the magnetic field while exponents close to 1 indicate baryonic jets",
    ". in our sample of six grbs observed with @xmath0 , the exponents @xmath5 of the relation between the characteristic energies of non - thermal and thermal components ( table [ tab : tab1 ] ) span the range of possible values , showing that energy content of grb jets ranges from being dominated by the magnetic field to being contained mostly in the kinetic energy of baryons in the jet .",
    "the @xmath0 gbm collaboration acknowledges support for gbm development , operations and data analysis from nasa in the us and bmwi / dlr in germany .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for very useful comments that aided in refining this work .                                                                                                      .indices ( @xmath5 ) and derived lorentz factor radial indices ( @xmath51 ) from fitting power laws to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 pairs for each grb . the inferred jet type and blackbody ( f@xmath53 ) to",
