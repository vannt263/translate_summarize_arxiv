    "according to rudy et al .",
    ", the dust was absent on their may  7 ( @xmath37=+50 days ) observations and was instead substantially present on may  31 ( @xmath37=+74 ) when they estimated from oi emission lines the reddening affecting the nova to have increased from @xmath12=1.0 to 1.3 .",
    "dust generally forms in novae during the transition from stellar to nebular spectra , right when the high ionization rapidly sweeps through the ejecta ( gehrz et al .",
    "1998 , shore and gehrz 2004 ) .",
    "thus , the rudy et al . ( 2007 ) announcement of dust forming in noph07 during persistent , low ionization conditions would correspond to an unusual behaviour for a nova .",

    "the event well documented by figure  1 , amounted to @xmath18=1.8  mag , @xmath42=0.4 and @xmath66=0.6 , which nicely correspond to an increase in the reddening by @xmath19=0.44 .    for a normal @xmath53=3.1 extiction law",
    ", a @xmath19=0.44 dust condensation event should produce @xmath43=0.28 and @xmath45=0.35 reddenings .",
    "we have instead observed @xmath43=0.5 and @xmath45=0.1 , that would correspond to @xmath19=0.80 and 0.12 , respectively .",
    "even if the mean value would well agree with @xmath19=0.44 derived from @xmath20 , @xmath0 and @xmath22 colors , nevertheless the observed @xmath43 and @xmath45 requires an explanation . to this aim",
    ", it is sufficient that a fraction of flux in the h@xmath16+[nii ] 6458 - 84  emission blend originates from gas external to the region where dust condensed .",
    "this emission blend usually accounts for the vast majority of the flux in the @xmath21-band of novae during advanced decline . for sake of discussion , if we assume that in noph07 at the time of the @xmath67=0.44 dust condensation event the h@xmath16+[nii ] blend was contributing 80% of the collected @xmath21-band flux , to account for the observed @xmath43=0.5 and @xmath45=0.1 it is enough that 10% of the h@xmath16+[nii ] 6458 - 84    flux was not affected by the extinction",
    ". this could be easily the case because [ nii ] originates in the most external parts of the ejecta , where the gas density is possibly too low to support fast and efficient dust grain formation .    to be properly addressed , the issue as to whether dust actually formed in nova oph 2007 , when and how much , and its radial location within the expanding ejecta , will have to wait for the publication of all available information , expecially infrared and spectroscopic data .",

    "we obtained the first spectrum at @xmath37=@xmath146 .",
    "it is a charaterized by low ionization conditions and weak emission lines of mainly feii , balmer and oi , flanked by p - cyg absorption profiles .",
    "the overall intensity of absorption lines , in particular of ch  4310   , caii h and k , nai d and h@xmath68 support a classification as an f2 - 3 supergiant ( allowing for a slight overabundance of carbon in the ejecta , as typical of novae ) .",
    "this matches the observed @xmath1=+1.0 color on the same ut date .",
    "two days later and 0.2 mag closer to maximum brightness on @xmath37=@xmath144 , all emission lines had weakened considerably , with only h@xmath16 , [ oi ]  7772    and feii 4923 , 5018    lines still displaying a detectable emission component .",
    "at the same time the underlying absorption spectrum increased , following a pattern quite typical for novae ( cf mclaughlin 1960 , hereafter m60 ) that sees a decrease in the ionization conditions and cooling of the spectral continuum along the rise to maximum brightness , and a reversed pattern durind the decline from it .",
    "the intensity of the absorption lines suggest an f5 supergiant to be the closest spectral classification .",
    "remarkably strong diffuse interstellar bands ( in particular 4430 , 5780 , 6284 and 6614   ) and interstellar lines ( nai d and caii h and k ) rise above the continuum of figure  3 .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath37=+9 and @xmath39=0.9 mag down from maximum is that of a classical feii - class nova , with all relevant feii multiplets in emission , balmer and nai lines also in strong emission , and feeble traces of [ oi ] , cii , [ nii ] and nii just beginning to emerge .",
    "figure  4 presents the evolution of the h@xmath16 profile from high resolution observations obtained on the same dates of the low resolution spectra of figure  3 .",
    "all three profiles clearly indicate the presence of two absorption components in addition to the emission one .",
    "a fitting with three gaussian components is overplotted to the observed profiles in figure  4 , and their radial velocity , fwhm , equivalent width and absolute flux are listed in table  2 . the post maximum spectrum on @xmath37=+9",
    "is characterized by an expansion velocity of the ejecta ( estimated from the h@xmath16 emission component ) of 730  km  sec@xmath48 , and the presence of the principal and diffuse enhanced absorption systems , whose displacement from the emission component are @xmath17650 and 1380 km / s , respectively .",
    "the statistical relations by m60 would predict for the @xmath50 , @xmath69 decline rates of noph07 a velocity for these absorption systems of 700 and 1350  km / s , pretty close to observed values .",
    "figure  5 illustrates the evolution with time of the fwhm of the h@xmath16 emission component and of the radial velocity of the principal absorption system , combining data in table  2 with naito and narusawa ( 2007 ) earlier measurement for @xmath37=@xmath147.3 .",
    "both suggest an evolution that reaches minimum values around the time of maximum brightness , as observed in other novae ( cf .",
    "m60 ) . for sake of documentation and without attaching to them excessive significance",
    "given the limited number of observational points they rest upon , the parabolic fitting in figure  5 of the fwhm of the h@xmath16 emission component is given by fwhm=470 + 13.8@xmath70 , and that for the velocity of the principal absorption system is radvel = @xmath14190 + 32@xmath71 .",
    "the photometric evolution presented in figure  1 is characterized by a marked flattening , settling in around @xmath37=+130 , that interrupted the normal decline when the nova was @xmath39=7.0  mag fainter than maximum .",
    "the effect is real because ( @xmath72 ) it is present in data collected independently with different instruments , and ( @xmath73 ) there is no evidence for an optical faint companion neither in our images , nor in dss , 2mass or denis survey data down to @xmath7420 mag , which could have perturbed the measurement of noph07 . the approaching conjunction with the sun stopped our monitoring at @xmath37=+200 and with it the possibility to further follow this interesting photometric phase .    99 buscombe , w. , de vaucouleurs , g. 1955 , obs . 75 , 170 capaccioli , m. et al .",
