    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is believed to be the fundamental theory of the strong interaction .",
    "however it is difficult to use to calculate the low energy properties of complicated quark - gluon systems directly , such as the nn interaction and the structure of multi - quark - gluon systems .",
    "various quark models afford a framework to understand the physics in these cases .    in the last 30 years",
    ", various qcd inspired models have been developed with both successes and failures in explaining low energy hadron physics .",
    "to mention a few but certainly not all , there are the mit bag model@xcite , cloudy bag model@xcite , friedberg - lee nontopological soliton model@xcite , skyrme topological soliton model@xcite , the constituent quark model@xcite , etc .",
    "different models use quite different effective degrees of freedom , which might be indicative of the nature of low - energy qcd . under different approximations",
    "one can `` derive '' these models from qcd@xcite .",
    "recently there has been a hot debate regarding the proper effective degrees of freedom of the constituent quark model@xcite .",
    "we performed a phenomenological study of the baryon interactions with three constituent quark models , the glozman - riska - brown quark - meson coupling model@xcite , the fujiwara quark - gluon - meson coupling model ",
    "one version of the manohar - georgi chiral quark model@xcite , and the quark delocalization , color screening model(qdcsm ) developed by ourselves  a modified version of the de rujula - georgi - glashow - isgur quark gluon coupling model@xcite , and found that , in about 2/3 of the channels formed from the octet and decuplet baryons , these three models gave qualitatively the same effective baryon - baryon ( b - b ) interactions@xcite .",
    "these constituent quark models have the same long range goldstone boson exchange interaction , ( except for the qdcsm , ) but have different mechanisms for the intermediate and short range interactions when they are used to study b - b interactions .",
    "present data on baryon spectroscopy and b - b interactions seem to be insufficient to distinguish between these models and they all seem to have an approximate qcd basis@xcite",
    ". a new generation of hadron spectroscopy should be helpful in disentangling these hadronic models .",
    "there are good reasons , both theoretically and phenomenologically , to believe that a two body confinement potential might be a good approximation for single hadrons .",
    "however there is no compelling reason to believe it is also a good approximation for multihadron systems .",
    "dibaryons provide a good testing ground for different confinement mechanisms and baryon interaction models .",
    "being the unique , stable , b=2 system , and its size , binding energy and quadrupole moment having been measured very precisely , the deuteron plays a vital role in the development of nn interaction models . since the h - particle , a dibaryon with strangeness @xmath6 , isospin i=0 and spin j=0 , was first predicted by the mit bag model in 1977@xcite , tremendous efforts have been made both experimentally and theoretically to search for it . up to now there is no experimental evidence for the h.    other dibaryon candidates have also been discussed in the literature .",
    "an s=0 , @xmath7 , m@xmath82.06 gev , @xmath9@xmath80.5 mev , i=0 or 2 dibaryon , @xmath10 , was a hot topic in the 1990s@xcite .",
    "the s=0 , i=0 , @xmath11 dibaryon , @xmath12 , has also been a long standing topic ; almost all quark models predict there should be attraction in this channel but with differing strengths in the different models@xcite . in 1987",
    ", we showed that the s=-3 , i=1/2 , j=2 dibaryon state might be a narrow resonance in a relativistic quark model  @xcite . in 1990 , v.  b.  kopeliovich _ et al_.@xcite predicted that there are strong interaction stable dibaryons with high strangeness , such as an s=-6 , di-@xmath2 within the flavor su(3 ) skyrmion model . a general survey of dibaryon states carried out with both the nonrelativistic qdcsm and the relativistic version , using an adiabatic calculation , found few high strangeness states with masses around the lowest threshold@xcite .",
    "zhang et al.@xcite predicted that the @xmath0 i=0 , j=0 dibaryon is strong interaction stable using a chiral su(3 ) quark model .    in this study , we use the extended qdcsm  @xcite to calculate the eigen energy of the di-@xmath2 state @xmath13 .",
    "this model allows the quark system to choose its most favorable configuration through its own dynamics in a larger hilbert space than the other models , and takes into account the possible difference of the confinement interaction inside a single baryon and between two color singlet baryons .",
    "in particular , this is the unique model that gives an explanation of the similarity between molecular and nuclear forces .",
    "it also explains why nuclei are accurately viewed as a collection of nucleons rather than a single big bag with 3a quarks .    here",
    ", we recalculate the qdcsm result because the extended qdcsm reproduces the deuteron properties well quantitatively , unlike the qdcsm , and because preliminary nn phase shift calculations using it fit the nn , n@xmath14 , n@xmath15 scattering data better than the earlier qdcsm calculations , which fit the data only qualitatively  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we expect this extended qdcsm calculation will provide a better model estimate of the mass of the di-@xmath2 .    in the following section",
    ", we give a short description of the extended qdcsm .",
    "the results and a discussion are presented in section iii .",
    "the details of the qdcsm and its extension can be found in refs.@xcite and the resonating - group calculation method ( rgm ) has been presented in refs.@xcite . here",
    "we present only the ( complete ) extended model hamiltonian , wave functions and the necessary equations used in the current calculation .",

    "we obtained the values of b , @xmath27 and @xmath28 by reproducing the @xmath29 mass difference , the nucleon mass and applying a stability condition .",
    "the mass of the u , d quark is assumed to be 1/3 of the nucleon mass to meet the requirements of the resonating group method ( rgm ) calculation while the strange quark mass @xmath30 is determined by an overall fit to the baryon octet and decuplet .",
    "a flavor symmetric overall octet quark - meson coupling constant is assumed for all of the octet mesons ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the color screening parameter @xmath32 is determined by the binding energy of the deuteron .",
    "the full set of parameters reproduces other properties of deuteron as well : the size and the d - s wave mixing amplitude .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the extended qdcsm has only one parameter , the color screening constant @xmath32 , that needs to be adjusted to obtain the correct binding energy of the deuteron , and that this is sufficient to reproduce well all of the properties of the deuteron .",
    "the tensor force of pion exchange plays a vital role in reproducing the deuteron properties quantitatively , but the results are not extremely sensitive to the meson exchange cutoff parameter , @xmath33 .    after introducing gaussian functions with different reference centers @xmath34 , i=1",
    "n , which play the role of the generating coordinates in this formalism , and including the wave function for the center - of - mass motion , the ansatz for the two - cluster wave function used in the rgm can be written as @xmath35^{is_k }   y^{l_k}(\\hat{\\vec { s_i}})]^j     [ \\chi_c(b_1)\\chi_c(b_2)]^{[\\sigma ] }      \\label{multi }   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where k is the channel index .",
    "for the di-@xmath2 , we have @xmath36 , corresponding to the channels @xmath0 s=0 , l=0 and s=2 , l=2 .",
    "we consider only these channels as they are the only ones coupled by the tensor interaction .",
    "the delocalized single - particle wave functions used in the qdcsm are @xmath37 the delocalization parameter , @xmath38 , is determined by the dynamics of the quark system rather than being one of the fixed ( adjusted ) parameters .",
    "from the variational principle , after variation with respect to the relative motion wavefunction @xmath39 , one obtains the rgm equation @xmath40    with the above ansatz , the rgm equation , eq.([rgm ] ) , becomes an algebraic eigenvalue equation , @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the ( eq.([multi ] ) ) wave function overlaps and hamiltonian matrix elements , respectively . by solving the generalized eigen value problem",
    ", we obtain the energies of the 6-quark system and their corresponding wave functions .",
    "our model parameters , which have been fixed by matching baryon and deuteron properties and using only @xmath1 meson exchange , are given in table i. for comparison , the results of our earlier calculation  @xcite without @xmath1 meson exchange are also included in table i. in order to study the dependence of the result on the short range cutoff radius , we choose three typical values : 0.6 , 0.8 and 1.0 fm , for the short - range cutoff of the @xmath1 meson exchange potential .",
    "this cutoff is necessary in our model approach because all short and intermediate range effects are already represented by the quark delocalization and color screening : the short range repulsion of the nn interaction is provided by a combination of the color magnetic interaction due to gluon exchange and the pauli principle enforced by the quark structure of the nucleon ; the intermediate range attraction conventionally modeled by heavy meson and multimeson exchange is also provided by quark delocalization and color screening .",
    "if the contact term of single @xmath1 meson exchange , @xmath43 , or its smeared version , exp@xmath44 , were used , double counting@xcite would occur .",
    "in all cases , we found that the contribution of @xmath1 meson exchange to the dibaryon mass is not large ( about 10 mev or less ) , primarily due to the effect of the short - range cutoff ; correspondingly , the deviations from the original qdcsm parameters are also quite small .",
    "repeating the same process mentioned above to fix the parameters , we found that adding @xmath45 and @xmath46-exchange affects the parameters ( b , @xmath28 , @xmath27 ) only slightly ; the properties of the deuteron can be reproduced just as well by a very small readjustment the color screening parameter , @xmath32 . comparing the results in table i and ii , we find the mass of the di-@xmath2 is almost unaffected by the addition of @xmath45 and @xmath46 exchange .",
    "this confirms our expectation that heavier ( shorter ranged ) meson exchanges are already represented by quark effects in our model , so that explicit representation of such exchanges beyond a cut - off scale are not important in our approach .    in summary , within the framework of the extended qdcsm , using a resonating group method , we estimate the mass of the di-@xmath2 to be about @xmath3 mev lower than the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "this mass is almost unaffected by channel coupling , the value of the short range cutoff length , @xmath5 , and heavier pseudoscalar meson exchanges .",
    "the inclusion of single pion or heavier meson exchange has only a minor effect on the di-@xmath2 mass .",
    "these results are consistent with the calculations of kopeliovich and of zhang et al.@xcite .",
    "we should , however , take note that the precision of any prediction of the di-@xmath2 mass is limited by that of the model itself .",
    "for example , in our model approach , the mass of the @xmath2 itself is found to be 1651 mev , or 21 mev less than the measured value .",
    "it could well be argued that this theoretical mass of the @xmath2 should be used to calculate the threshold .",
    "we would then conclude that the di-@xmath2 mass is no more than @xmath47 mev below threshold . from the model deviations from experimental values for single baryon masses",
    ", we estimate a total systematic uncertainty of order 30 mev as a reasonable value to assign to our model .    moreover , it is difficult to estimate how much of the model uncertainty is carried over to the dibaryon calculation for such a high strangeness quark system , because the model parameters are mainly determined by the experimental data of the nonstrange sector . therefore , when designing a detector system to hunt for the di-@xmath2 state , it is theoretically advisable to take into account the possibility that the di-@xmath2 may be either stable or unstable with respect to the strong interaction .",
