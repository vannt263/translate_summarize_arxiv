    "in this report we discuss recent studies of the related rare @xmath0 decay modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 by the ktev experiment at fermilab .",
    "the decays share the `` inner bremsstrahlung '' ( ib ) and `` direct emission '' ( de ) diagrams of figure  [ diagrams ] :    1.0 truein 1.0 truein 1.0 truein    the two decays differ in that the photon converts internally in the @xmath2 case . a third diagram known as the `` @xmath3 charge radius '' contribution contributes at a low level ( @xmath4 4% of the de  @xcite ) to the @xmath2 branching ratio only .",
    "one item of particular interest is the form factor for the de decay .",
    "historically  @xcite  @xcite this has been expressed in the form of a @xmath5propagator modification to the magnetic dipole ( m1 ) de amplitude : @xmath6 where @xmath7 the effect of the form factor is to soften the photon energy spectrum of the m1 de decay .",
    "the parametric ratio @xmath8 can then be related to the de branching ratio by particular chiral models  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath2 which was first reported in the literature by ktev  @xcite provides the opportunity for further study of the @xmath9 vertices through the coupling of the @xmath10 decay plane to the helicity of the photon .",
    "interference between the de and ib photon helicity states results in a manifestly @xmath11violating angular asymmetry between the @xmath12 and @xmath10 decay planes  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "ktev consists of 85 collaborators from 12 institutions from the u.s . and japan  @xcite . the primary goal of ktev is the measurement of the direct @xmath13violating parameter @xmath14 with a precision of a part in @xmath15 .",
    "the detector configuration is shown in figure  [ detector ] .    3.0 truein    -.2 cm    the ktev charged particle detector consists of four drift chambers ; two upstream and two downstream of a dipole analysing magnet .",
    "a 3100 crystal csi calorimeter provides precise energy measurement of photons and pion versus electron particle identification .",
    "the analyses reported here are from data taken by ktev between the fall of 1996 and the summer of 1997 .",
    "the @xmath1 events for the analysis presented here were taken from the fall 1996 ktev data set .",
    "this data accounts for roughly a tenth of the @xmath1 data in hand .",
    "events were selected by requiring :    * two high - quality tracks forming a good vertex and satisfying fiducial volume cuts and standard cuts on the veto counters . energy deposited in the calorimeter must not be consistent with an electron .",
    "* at least one additional cluster of energy greater than 1.5 gev must be present in the calorimeter . * the pion and gamma clusters in the calorimeter must be separated by at least 20 centimeters .",
    "this is to supress backgrounds from @xmath16 decays accompanied by accidental activity or pion hadronic showers .",
    "* the gamma energy in the center of mass must be greater than 20 mev . *",
    "the missing @xmath17 must have imaginary momentum under the @xmath18 hypothesis in order to suppress this background .",
    "this last requirement is achieved by demanding that the quantity @xmath19 be negative ( @xmath20 gev@xmath21 ) .",
    "the resultant very clean @xmath1 signal is shown in figure  [ ppgmass ] .",
    "3.0 truein    the remaining background is small ( about 0.5% ) and is believed to consist primarily of residual @xmath16 decays accompanied by pion showers in the calorimeter .    to extract the interesting physics from this decay mode",
    "we turn our attention to the photon energy in the kaon center  of  mass system .",
    "this distribution for the 1996 data is shown in figure  [ egcom ] along with the monte carlo distributions for the ib and ( @xmath5propagator form factor modified ) de decays .",
    "3.0 truein    the @xmath5propagator parameter @xmath8 and the relative normalization @xmath22 are obtained from minuit @xmath23 minimization .",
    "the results of the fit are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "systematic effects in both of these numbers due to backgrounds and accidental activity are negligible as are effects due to the variation of most cuts .",
    "2% systematic errors are assigned to @xmath8 due to shifts in the result from variation of the lower @xmath26 cut .",
    "systematic errors in the ratio @xmath27 are assigned due to shifts in the result with variations of the @xmath26 cut ( 2% ) and @xmath28 separation cut ( 2% ) .",
    "results for the form  factor parameter @xmath8 differ substantially from those reported in the literature  @xcite as illustrated in figure  [ ampratio ] .    3.0 truein    the reason for this apparent discrepancy has been traced to the fact  @xcite that the e731 result assumed the lin and valencia model in extracting @xmath8 whereas the ktev result is a true model  independent measurement of this quantity .",
    "reanalysis of the e731 data by the author indicates that the data from the two experiments are completely consistent .",
    "we next turn our attention to the @xmath2 analysis with emphasis on extraction of the @xmath11violating angular asymmetry .",
    "ktev reported the first branching ratio measurement for this decay  @xcite based on a subset of the data and has recently presented an improved number based on the full data set  @xcite ( see figure  [ ppeemass ] ) .",
    "3.0 truein    as the acceptance of the ktev spectrometer for the @xmath2 decay is a strong function of the virtual photon energy the extraction of the angular asymmetry is a two  step process : first the data is fit to extract the best values of the form factor parameter @xmath8 and the de amplitude .",
    "then the monte carlo is tuned to the best  fit values for the final acceptance calculation .",
    "figure  [ ppeephi ] shows the @xmath2 angular distributions for data and monte carlo after the fit for the form factor and m1 amplitude .",
    "3.0 truein    the raw ( before acceptance correction ) asymmetry of the data is clear .",
    "after acceptance correction the value of the asymmetry is : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the number of events in the right and left hand sides  respectively  of the @xmath32 plot in figure  [ ppeephi ] .",
    "systematic errors of less than a percent are assigned to the asymmetry from ( 1 ) detector resolution ( 2 ) uncertainties in the form factor and m1 amplitude and ( 3 ) variations in physics cuts .",
    "the total systematic error on the @xmath2 plane  angle asymmetry measurement is estimated to be about 1.1% .",
    "the numerical results presented here are summarized in table 1 . here for the first time we present an improved @xmath1 direct emission branching ratio .",
    "we also present the first theory  independent measurements of a form factor in the @xmath9 direct emission process in two complimentary decay modes .",
    "the observed planar ",
    "angle asymmetry in the @xmath2 decay is the first instance of @xmath13violation in a dynamical variable and is manifestly @xmath11violating as well ."
