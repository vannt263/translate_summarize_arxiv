    "the theory of agreement or consensus problems for multi - agent systems has emerged as a challenging new area of research in recent years .",
    "it is a basic yet fundamental problem in decentralized control of networks of dynamic agents and has attracted great attention of researchers .",
    "this is partly due to its broad applications in cooperative control of unmanned air vehicles , formation control of mobile robots , control of communication networks , design of sensor networks , flocking of social insects , swarm - based computing , etc .    in @xcite , vicsek et al .",
    "proposed a simple but interesting discrete - time model of @xmath0 agents all moving in the plane .",
    "each agent s motion is updated using a local rule based on its own state and the states of its neighbors .",
    "the vicsek model can be viewed as a special case of a computer model mimicking animal aggregation proposed in @xcite for the computer animation industry . by using graph theory and nonnegative matrix theory , jadbabaie et al .",
    "provided a theoretical explanation of the consensus behavior of the vicsek model in @xcite , where each agent s set of neighbors changes with time as system evolves .",
    "the typical continuous - time model was proposed by olfati - saber and murray in @xcite , where the concepts of solvability of agreement problems and agreement protocols were first introduced . in @xcite ,",
    "olfati - saber and murray used a directed graph to model the communication topology among agents and studied three agreement problems .",
    "they are directed networks with fixed topology , directed networks with switching topology , and undirected networks with communication time - delays and fixed topology . and it was assumed that the directed topology is balanced and strongly connected . in @xcite ,",
    "ren and beard extended the results of @xcite and @xcite and presented more relaxable conditions for state agreement under dynamically changing directed interaction topology . in the past two years , agreement problems of multi - agent systems",
    "have been developing fast and several research topics have been addressed , such as agreement over random networks @xcite , asynchronous information consensus @xcite , dynamic consensus @xcite , networks with nonlinear agreement protocols @xcite , consensus filters @xcite , and networks with communication time - delays @xcite . for details , see the survey @xcite and references therein .    by long - time observation of animal aggregations , such as schools of fish , flocks of birds , groups of bees , and swarms of social bacteria ,",
    "it is believed that simple , local motion coordination rules at the individual level can result in remarkable and complex intelligent behavior at the group level .",
    "we call those local motion coordination rules _ protocols_. in the study of agreement problems , they are called _",
    "agreement protocols_.    in the analysis of agreement problems , convergence rate is an important performance index of the proposed agreement protocol . in @xcite ,",
    "a linear agreement protocol was given and it was shown that the second smallest eigenvalue of interaction graph laplacian , called algebraic connectivity of graph , quantifies the speed of convergence of consensus algorithms . in @xcite , kim and",
    "mesbahi considered the problem of finding the best vertex positional configuration so that the second smallest eigenvalue of the corresponding graph laplacian is maximized , where the weight for an edge between two vertices is a function of the distance between the corresponding two agents . in @xcite ,",
    "xiao and boyd considered and solved the problem of the weight design by using semi - definite convex programming , so that algebraic connectivity is increased . if the communication topology is a small - world networks , it was shown that large algebraic connectivity can be obtained @xcite .",
    "although by maximizing the second smallest eigenvalue of topology graph laplacian , we can get better convergence rate of the linear protocol proposed in @xcite , the state agreement can never occur in a finite time .",
    "therefore , finite - time agreement is more appealing and there are a number of settings where finite - time convergence is a desirable property .",
    "our goal in this paper is to address finite - time agreement problems and present two distributed protocols that can solve agreement problems in finite time .",
    "the method used in this paper is partly motivated by the work of @xcite , in which continuous finite - time differential equations were introduced as fast accurate controllers for dynamical systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we state the considered problem . in section iii , we give our main results .",
    "simulation results are given in section iv . finally , concluding remarks are stated in section v.",
    "the distributed dynamic system studied in this paper consists of @xmath0 autonomous agents , e.g. particles or robots , labeled @xmath1 through @xmath0 .",
    "all these agents share a common state space @xmath2 .",
    "we use @xmath3 to denote the state of agent @xmath4 and suppose that agent @xmath4 is with the following dynamics @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , seen as a whole , is the protocol to be designed , and @xmath8 .    in this multi - agent system , each agent can communicate with some other agents which are defined as its neighbors .",
    "we use a weighted undirected graph @xmath9 to represent the communication topology , where @xmath10 $ ] is a @xmath11 nonnegative symmetric matrix , @xmath12 is the vertex set , and @xmath13 is the edge set .",
    "vertex @xmath14 corresponds to agent @xmath4 .",
    "an edge of @xmath15 is denoted by @xmath16 , which is an unordered pair of vertices .",
    "@xmath17 , if and only if @xmath18 , if and only if agents @xmath4 and @xmath19 can communicate with each other , i.e. , they are adjacent . moreover",
    ", we assume that @xmath20 for all @xmath7 .",
    "we call @xmath21 the weight matrix and @xmath22 is the _ weight _ of edge @xmath16 . in consistence with the definition of agents neighbors , the set of neighbors of vertex @xmath14",
    "is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "a _ path _ in a graph from @xmath14 to @xmath24 is a sequence of distinct vertices starting with @xmath14 and ending with @xmath24 such that consecutive vertices are adjacent .",
    "a graph is _ connected _ if there is a path between any two vertices of the graph .",
    "more comprehensive discussions about graph can be found in @xcite .",
    "protocol @xmath25 is a state feedback , which is designed based on the state information received by agent @xmath4 from its neighbors .",
    "given protocol @xmath25 , @xmath7 , we say that @xmath25 or this multi - agent system solves an agreement problem if for any given initial states and any @xmath26 , @xmath27 , as @xmath28 , and we say that it solves a finite - time agreement problem if for any initial states , there exist a time @xmath29 and a real number @xmath30 such that @xmath31 for @xmath32 and for all @xmath33 .",
    "if the final agreement state is the average of the initial states , i.e. , @xmath34 for all @xmath33 as @xmath28 , we say that it solves the average - agreement problem .    with the above preparation , we present two agreement protocols that solve agreement problems in finite time :    \\i ) @xmath35    \\ii ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the sign function , such that @xmath39    _ remark : _ if we set @xmath40 in the above protocols and , then they will become the typical linear agreement protocol studied in @xcite and @xcite , and solve the average - agreement problem asymptotically provided that @xmath15 is connected . if we set @xmath41 in and , they will become noncontinuous .",
    "research of them is beyond the scope of our study . in the next section",
    ", we will show that protocols and all solve the finite - time agreement problems if @xmath15 is connected and @xmath37 .",
    "_ remark : _ the information exchange among agents is assumed to be bidirectional and thus the communication topology can be represented by an undirect graph . the study of the case with unidirectional information exchange will be a future research direction .",
    "we assume in this note that @xmath15 is connected , since if @xmath15 is not connected , then there exist at least two groups of agents , between which there does not exist information exchange , and therefore it is impossible for the system to solve an agreement problem through distributed protocols .",

    "we first show that the equilibrium point set of the considered differential equations @xmath44 , is the set of all agreement states .    with protocol or ,",

    "we hope that all the equilibrium points are stable and state of the system reaches @xmath63 in finite time .",
    "apparently , protocol and are continuous with respect to state variables @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , if we adopt one of these two protocols , then for any initial state @xmath65 , by peano s existence theorem and extension theorem @xcite , there exists at least one solution of differential equation on @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , one notices that and are not lipschitz at some points . as all solutions reach subspace @xmath46 in finite time , there is nonuniqueness of solutions in backwards time .",
    "this , of course , violates the uniqueness condition for solutions of lipschitz differential equations .    in order to establish our main results ,",
