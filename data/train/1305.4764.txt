    "mercury has a peculiar rotation : three rotation periods correspond to two revolution periods .",
    "this spin - orbit resonance leads to interesting physical phenomena such as the longitudinal librations .",
    "the librations are caused by the non - spherical mass distribution of mercury , on which the sun exerts a gravitational torque .",
    "the difference between the orbital and the rotation periods leads to a varying torque along the orbit since the orientation of the long axis of mercury changes with respect to the direction to the sun .",
    "eccentricity further contributes to the variability by causing changes in the distance to the sun and in the orbital speed .",
    "the main libration has a period of 87.97 days , equal to mercury s orbital ( annual ) period , and an amplitude of @xmath0 arcsec @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are smaller amplitude librations at harmonic ( semi - annual , ter - annual , ... ) frequencies .",
    "those librations depend on the interior structure , notably the presence and the size of a liquid core inside the planet . by measuring the librations",
    ", we can infer knowledge about the interior structure .",
    "for example , by measuring mercury s 88d libration amplitude , @xcite concluded that mercury has a large liquid core . since a magnetic field has been detected by the mariner 10 spacecraft ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , it is thought that mercury may have a solid inner core inside its liquid core . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have investigated the consequence of the addition of a solid inner core on the rotation dynamics of mercury .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that , if the inner core is larger than about 1000 km , the difference on the 88d libration amplitude may be non - negligible , and of the same order as the present uncertainty , about 1.5 as .",
    "another forced libration results from planetary perturbations .",
    "the periodic force arising from the gravitational interaction of a planetary body with mercury causes a perturbation of mercury s orbital motion , changing its position relative to the sun and thus altering the solar torque acting on its equatorial bulge .",
    "this is an indirect effect of the planets on the rotation of mercury .",
    "these long - period forced librations induced by the planetary perturbations have been predicted by e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they have periods commensurate with the orbital revolution of the planets involved and are expected to have small amplitudes unless their period is close to the period of a free libration in which case a near - resonant amplification can occur . in the absence of an inner core , there is only one such mode , the free mantle libration .",
    "this mode describes an oscillation of the axis of minimum moment of inertia about the mercury - sun line at perihelion @xcite .",
    "the period of the free mantle libration depends on the moments of inertia of mercury , and is approximately 12 years .",
    "this is very close to jupiter s perturbation on mercury s orbit at 11.86y ; @xcite and @xcite have shown that a forced libration of 20 arcsec or more can be generated , the exact amplitude depending on the moments of inertia . besides this 11.86y forced libration ,",
    "at least 4 other long - period forced librations have amplitudes larger than the arcsecond level .",
    "the previous studies on the long - period forced librations assumed no mantle - inner core coupling . adding an inner core has two effects on the free libration : first , as shown by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , it can lengthen the period of the free libration of the mantle since the motion of the mantle is locked to that of the inner core for this mode . as a result , interior models with a large inner core may no longer have a free period close to jupiter s orbital period .",
    "second , the presence of the inner core adds a second free libration , closely approximated by the free gravitational oscillation between the mantle and inner core , and thus the possibility of additional resonances at other orbit perturbation frequencies .    in this study , we investigate how a non - spherical inner core coupled to the mantle and the outer core may influence the long - period forced librations . since",
    "planetary perturbation periods may be close to the period of the two free modes , the long - period librations may be resonantly enhanced and this may lead to a rotation angle that substantially differs from a model where there is no solid inner core .",
    "the presence of the solid inner core affects the rotation state of mercury and may result in a signature that is detectable in the observations , in which case it must be taken into account when analyzing the data . in our rotation model",
    ", we also take into account the dissipation since this effect reduces the libration amplitudes and introduces phase lags .",
    "we include viscous and electromagnetic coupling at the core - mantle and inner - outer core boundaries , as well as the effect of viscous deformation within the inner core .",
    "the signature of the parameters responsible for the dissipation on the libration is discussed .    in the theory section",
    ", we derive equations for the amplitude of the long - period forced librations of the mantle and of the inner core .",
    "the equations are given for cases with and without dissipation .",
    "we then numerically evaluate these libration equations on the basis of recent interior models of mercury s @xcite ( section 1.7 ) .",
    "the results are compared for different interior models . in the results section ( section 2 ) , we show that the amplitude of the long - period librations are of the order of a few arcsec , and much larger if the forcing period approaches the period of one of the free modes . in the last section ( section 3 ) , we compare predictions of libration models with and without mantle - inner core coupling with the earth - based radar observations of the rotation rate of mercury of @xcite in order to determine whether the size of the inner core can be determined on the basis of the currently available radar data .",
    "we assume an equatorial flattened bi - axial model of mercury with a silicate shell composed of the mantle and the crust ( we use the symbol @xmath1 for the shell ) , a fluid outer core ( @xmath2 ) and the solid inner part of the core ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "if the mantle and the inner core have a different rotation , their principal axes of inertia will be misaligned and there will be an effect of the gravitational and pressure coupling between these layers ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the librational motion of the mantle and the solid inner core can be described by considering the change in angular momentum of these layers as a result of the external torque of the sun and the internal torques . for the libration equation , we assume that the mantle and inner core are rigid solids as the effect of elastic deformations has been shown to be below the observational detection limit @xcite .",
    "we then have the equations of motion : @xmath4 the rotation angle of the mantle @xmath5 describes the orientation of the axis of minimum moment of inertia of the mantle @xmath6 relative to the intersection between the ecliptic and the orbital plane at j2000 .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 is the rotation angle of the inner core .",
    "@xmath8 is the true anomaly , @xmath9 the longitude of the pericenter , @xmath10 the distance between the mass centers of mercury and the sun , @xmath11 are the principal moments of inertia of the inner core and @xmath12 the mantle moments of inertia .",
    "@xmath13 is the mean motion of mercury , @xmath14 the mass of the sun and @xmath15 the gravitational constant .",
    "the factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 describe the strengths of the gravitational and pressure torques on the mantle and inner core , respectively @xcite .",
    "these factors are defined by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the principal moments of inertia of the bottom part of the fluid core ( a layer between the inner core - outer core boundary ( icb ) and the smallest sphere that can be included in the fluid core , see fig .  2 of @xcite ) while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are related to the rest of the fluid core .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath24 and @xmath25 capture the solar gravitational torques on the mantle and inner core , respectively .",
    "the additional terms arise from the pressure torques on the boundaries between the outer core and mantle and between the inner core and outer core .",
    "it can be shown that in the limit of no inner core , the expression of @xmath16 reduces to @xmath26 , and we retrieve the classical equation of a planet with two layers .",
    "@xmath27 is the gravitational - pressure coupling constant between the mantle and the inner core .",
    "if the inner and outer parts of the core have uniform density @xmath28 ( @xmath29 for the fluid outer core , @xmath30 for the solid inner core and @xmath31 for the silicate shell ) , @xmath27 is defined by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "if an ellipsoidal surface of constant density at a given radius has its three principal semi - axes defined by @xmath36 , the geometrical flattening in the equatorial plane is defined by @xmath37 . for the computation of the longitudinal librations , the polar flattening may be neglected . when radial density variations in both the fluid and solid cores are taken into account ,",
    "the expression for @xmath27 is more complicated and given in @xcite .",
    "since the effect of the small obliquity on the longitudinal librations is below the observational detection limit , the obliquity of mercury is assumed to be @xmath38 ( its true value is @xmath39 , @xcite ) so that mercury s equator and orbit are the same plane .",
    "previous studies of the effect of the inner core on mercury s rotation focused on the amplitude of the 88d librations and considered a kepler orbit , in which the orbital elements are constant with time , except for the true and the mean anomalies . in order to derive differential equations that use a small angle , the rotation angle @xmath5",
    "is usually related to the mantle libration angle @xmath40 with the relation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mean anomaly of the orbital motion and @xmath43 is a chosen initial time .",
    "a similar expression is used to relate @xmath7 and @xmath44 , the libration angles of the inner core .    when long - period librations are considered , the longitude of the pericenter @xmath9 is no longer constant with time while the true anomaly @xmath45 and the distance between mercury and the sun @xmath46 have a quasiperiodic evolution because of the planetary perturbations that affect the orbit of mercury .",
    "following @xcite we define the mantle libration angle @xmath40 and an inner core libration angle @xmath44 by @xmath47 where the angle @xmath48 is defined by @xmath49 .",
    "all these angles are functions of time .",
    "the angle @xmath48 can be written as a sum of the mean rotation and a frequency decomposition @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the amplitude , angular frequency and phase of the different planetary perturbations on mercury s orbit .",
    "the origin of the angles @xmath5 and @xmath7 is defined by a fixed line with respect to an inertial frame , while the origin of the @xmath40 and @xmath44 angles is moving because of the planetary perturbations ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "only @xmath5 can be observed although the libration angle of the mantle @xmath40 is more convenient mathematically because it is a small quantity .",
    "to compute the long - period forced librations , the differential equations ( [ eq_psm ] ) and ( [ eq_pss ] ) are expanded as two functions of the mean anomaly and of the eccentricity .",
    "since we study the long - period librations , we discard the terms containing the mean anomaly of mercury in the right hand side of the equations .",
    "however terms containing the second time derivative of the mean anomaly and the longitude of the pericenter ( @xmath54 ) remain in the left hand side of the equations @xcite .",
    "the angles @xmath40 and @xmath44 are usually small , so that the small angle approximation can also be used . we get two linearized equations for @xmath40 and @xmath44 that contain the planetary perturbations on the orbit of mercury @xmath55 where the frequencies @xmath56 and @xmath57 are given by @xmath58 and where @xmath59 is a function of the eccentricity ( @xmath60 ) .    in the linearized equations ( [ eq_gamf ] ) and ( [ eq_gasf ] ) , the planetary perturbations are not included as a torque acting on the mantle and the inner core ( this direct effect is negligible because of the large distance between mercury and the other planets ) but appear as an indirect effect , through the definition of the @xmath61 angles .",

    "a different choice of @xmath69 within its @xmath100 error bound largely affects the amplitude and location of the resonance because @xmath69 determines the amplitude of the planetary flattening , and therefore it affects the values for @xmath27 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . because the free period @xmath70 is very sensitive to the flattening assumption , a small change in the core equatorial flattening induces a change in the position of the resonance and the level of amplification .",

    "( [ eq_psimimax ] ) ) of the maximal amplitude for @xmath5 : in the denominator , the coefficient in front of the damping parameter @xmath104 is much smaller than the one in front of @xmath105 .",
    "dissipation can significantly change the phase of the libration but since the electromagnetic and viscous couplings are usually smaller than the gravitational coupling , this only happens if a planetary perturbation frequency is very close to the free mode frequency . if the differences between the frequencies @xmath107 and @xmath108 are larger than about @xmath109 rad / y , the phase angle @xmath110 ( eq .  ( [ eq_psiphase ] ) ) reduces to @xmath53 or to @xmath111 ( the value depends on the sign of the frequency differences ) with an error of less than @xmath112 for the nominal value of the dissipation parameters .",
    "the widths of the resonance peaks depend mostly on the amplitude of the planetary perturbations @xmath51 and only very slightly on the damping parameters",
    ".    calculations with different choices of the inner core viscous relaxation time @xmath113 show that , provided @xmath113 is larger than about 25 years , the main difference in the results is a reduction of the peak amplitude of librations at the resonance .",
    "thus , except for inner core radii where the free period @xmath72 or @xmath70 almost matches a planetary forcing period , our results in the previous section are barely sensitive to the precise value of @xmath113 . however ,",
    "if @xmath113 is of the order of about 25y or less , then the amplitude of the long - period librations are reduced for a much broader range of inner core radii .",
    "if @xmath113 is less than a few years , then the amplitudes of the long - period librations are almost reduced to the original orbital perturbation @xmath51 .",
    "the phases of the long - period librations are also largely changed .",
    "the amplitude of the 88d forced libration ( 38.5 as , @xcite ) has approximately the same order of magnitude as the long - period forced librations ( see fig .  [ fig_amplit ] ) .",
    "this is not the case for the amplitudes of the angular rotation velocity variations @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_amplit2 ] ) : the 88d amplitude is about 1000 as / y , about 10 to 100 times larger than the long - period amplitudes .",
    "this is due to the temporal derivative that leads to more prominent short - period effects in the rotation rate than in the libration angle .",
    "the long - period librations will be more difficult to detect in spin radar data than in orientation data .",
    "these amplitudes may also be compared to the present uncertainty on the observations of the rotation state of mercury .",
    "the average precision on the rotation rates obtained with earth - based radar data @xcite is of the order of 180 as / y .",
    "[ fig_amplit2 ] shows that a velocity amplitude larger than 180 as / y only occurs under a very specific range of inner core radii ( except in the case of the 11.86y libration period for which the signature may be detectable over a larger range of inner core radii ) .",
    "given the current observational precision , it follows from the calculated libration velocities , that a large difference between models with and without inner core coupling can only be seen if mercury happens to be close to a resonance .",
    "the libration angle can also be measured directly .",
    "a measurement of the libration amplitude was recently provided by @xcite using messenger data with an uncertainty on the 88d libration amplitude of about 5 as .",
    "the expected precision on the libration angle with the bepicolombo spacecraft is about 1 arcsecond @xcite .",
    "[ fig_amplit ] shows that libration signatures for a large fraction of interior models would exceed a few arcseconds and would therefore be detectable .",
    "therefore , the influence of the inner core in the long - period forced librations has a better chance to be detected on the basis of future observations of the libration angle rather than the rotation rate .    in order to gain pertinent inferences about the interior structure of mercury",
    ", one would need arcsecond precision observations of the libration angle over a time interval long enough to identify the planetary periods , i.e. , 5 - 15y .",
    "clearly , predictions of the long - period forced librations from our model depend on many parameters that are not well known such as the inner core size , the interior density structure , etc . different combination of these parameters can generate long - period librations of equivalent amplitudes .",
    "nevertheless , despite the non - uniqueness , the constraint of matching predicted with observed long - period librations would reduce the possible parameter space and thus provide valuable information on mercury s interior .",
    "the 88d libration amplitude of the inner core @xmath44 is much smaller than the 88d libration amplitude of the mantle @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the 88d libration is between @xmath114 and @xmath115 as , depending on the interior model and the flattening assumption . at semi - annual period",
    ", the inner core libration is below 0.2 as @xcite .",
    "however , the long - period librations of the inner core may also be largely amplified , for the same frequencies as the mantle libration since the denominators in the equations for the libration amplitude are the same for the inner core and for the mantle ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq_gaman ] ) and ( [ eq_gasan ] ) ) .",
    "although inner core librations could in principle be detected through their effect on the degree - two , order - two gravitational coefficient @xmath69 , the signal is probably too weak to be observed in the near future by either messenger or bepicolombo .",
    "in this section , we investigate whether including the coupling between the mantle and inner core can improve the fit to the radar data of @xcite and determine whether it is possible to constrain the size of the inner core from the measurements of the rotation rate .",
    "earth - based radar measurements of the instantaneous spin state of mercury have been made at 35 different epochs between 2002 and 2012 @xcite . from the correlation of the radar echo signals at two earth stations",
    ", @xcite obtained 35 instantaneous spin rate values .",
    "currently , the averaged uncertainty on these rotation rates is about 180 as / y . since two polarizations have been recorded , two data points and the associated uncertainties are available at each epoch . + we fit the observed rotation rates with a rotation model for mercury that includes the short - period forced librations ( annual , semi - annual , etc . , see section [ sec88 ] ) and the long - period forced librations .",
    "the model also includes dissipation at the cmb and icb ( damping parameters @xmath90/y ) .",
    "we assume that the two free librations have not been excited recently ( e.g. by an internal forcing , @xcite ) and have attenuated to a negligible amplitude . adding a free libration",
    "would also complicate the analysis by introducing additional parameters to estimate and by a possible overlap with the 11.86y libration . in order to compare the solution without an inner core with a situation with an inner core",
    ", we use as an estimator of the goodness of the fit the reduced @xmath116 ( sum of the squares of the differences between the model and the data expressed in units of the uncertainty , divided by the number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we seek a global minimum of the reduced @xmath116 for all the interior models .     as a function of the annual libration amplitude for the ec interior model class with a cold temperature profile .",
    "the inner core radius increases from right to the left .",
    "the assumption for the flattening is @xmath92 .",
    "the black ( dashed ) line shows the reduced @xmath116 using a rotation model with ( without ) inner core coupling.,height=188 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig_chi2 ] shows that the main effect on the reduced @xmath116 is the 88d libration amplitude .",
    "the reduced @xmath116 has a strong dependence on the 88d libration amplitude , both for interior models that take into account the mantle - inner core coupling and for those that do not .",
    "additionally we see that the long - period forced librations increases the reduced @xmath116 for very specific interior models . to match the constraints on mercury s mass , models with large inner core have smaller outer core radius ; this leads to an increase in @xmath117 and thus a decrease in @xmath95 and in the 88d amplitude .",
    "therefore the interior models with small inner cores have 88d libration amplitude larger than 39 as in fig .  4 while models with large inner cores have a 88d libration amplitude smaller then 35 as .    in general , the inclusion of mantle - inner core coupling in the rotation model does not improve the best fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig_chi2 ] ) .",
    "the global minimal reduced @xmath116 is about @xmath118 , which is about the same as for the situation without mantle - inner core coupling .",
    "the effects of a small inner core ( radius smaller than about 500 km ) on the rotation model are usually so small that the rotation models with and without mantle - inner core coupling produce almost the same @xmath116 .",
    "however if a resonance between one of the free modes and one of the planetary perturbation periods occurs for some particular interior model , the amplitude of the long - period libration becomes very large and the fit is usually degraded .",
    "thus , based on the reduced @xmath116 analysis , we conclude that the radar observations suggest that mercury s librations do not contain large , resonantly amplified , long - period forced librations .",
    "other flattening assumptions change the position of the resonances , but do not globally decrease the reduced @xmath116 .     as a function of the inner core radius for the ec interior model and a cold temperature profile",
    "( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the assumption for the flattening is @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the black ( dashed ) line shows the reduced @xmath116 using a rotation model with ( without ) mantle - inner core coupling .",
    "we see that a global minimum for the reduced @xmath116 is when the inner core radius is @xmath121 km , indicating the best fit model.,height=188 ]    some interior models have been found that have a reduced @xmath116 smaller than 0.4 when inner core coupling is included .",
    "for example , the reduced @xmath116 is @xmath122 ( see fig .  [ fig_chi2glomin ] ) if @xmath92/2 , @xmath123 km and using a cold mantle with a low density ( ec model of @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to a resonance between the 5.66y perturbation and the free period @xmath70 .",
    "for some specific inner core radii close to 1186 km , an amplitude of 23 as for the 5.66y libration allows for a better fit to the observations . however , the improvement in the fit is extremely sensitive to the precise amplification of the 5.66y libration : a small increase in the amplification leads to a large reduced @xmath116 and degrades the fit dramatically .",
    "if we explore the confidence interval for @xmath69 and the other parameters of our model , it is also possible to find very sharp resonances that can , for very specific interior model and inner core radius , slightly decrease the reduced @xmath116 .",
    "the effect of the inner core can therefore provide a slightly better fit to the data for specific interior structure models .",
    "however , the improvement is only marginal and it can not be reasonably argued that they provide a better match to the libration observations .",
    "the uncertainty on the available data is presently too large to be sensitive to the effect of mantle - inner core coupling and by extension , to the size of the inner core . additionally , the time period covered by the available data is too short to separate the different libration amplitudes . since a dramatic worsening of",
    "the fit may occur at resonances , we can only conclude that a very large amplification is most likely not present in mercury s librations . based on this",
    ", combinations of interior parameters that would yield a free mode period very close to one of the main long - period librations must be rejected .",
    "we presented a theory to compute the amplitude and phase of the long - period forced librations of mercury .",
    "these long - period librations are caused by the planetary perturbations on the orbit of mercury .",
    "our model takes into account the internal coupling that occurs between the solid inner core , fluid outer core and mantle .",
    "this includes gravitational and pressure torques between these layers , as well as viscous and electromagnetic couplings at the cmb and icb .",
    "our model also includes viscous deformation of the inner core .",
    "previous studies that have investigated the long - period forced librations of mercury did not take into account the coupling dynamics of the inner core with the rest of the planet .",
    "the inclusion of the inner core leads to two eigen modes that have a large range of possible periods .",
    "their precise periods depend on the interior structure , including the size of the inner core .",
    "large amplification of a long - period forced libration occurs if its period is close to one of the free mode periods .",
    "our results show that for a large set of models , long - period forced librations may have an amplitude well above 5 arcsec . for a small inner core radius ,",
    "the first free period @xmath72 is close to the jupiter perturbation period at @xmath83y while for a large inner core , it can be closer to saturn orbital perturbation at @xmath84y",
    ". the second free period may be resonant with several orbital perturbations : @xmath86y , @xmath87y , @xmath88y , @xmath89y and even the @xmath83y perturbation .",
    "except very close to resonance periods , the long - period forced librations are not sensitive to the strength and nature of the coupling at the cmb and icb if the damping parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 are smaller than @xmath106/y .",
    "our results are also insensitive to viscous deformation within the inner core , except for the maximal amplitude of the resonances peaks , provided they occur on a characteristic timescale longer than 25y .",
    "we also tested whether the inclusion of an inner core can provide a better fit to the earth based radar observations of mercury s rotation rate .",
    "because the long - period forced librations have amplitudes that are below the current uncertainty on these observations and because the time interval they cover is short compared to the main planetary forcing periods , the data are not very sensitive to these long - period forced librations . therefore , it is not possible to detect the dynamical influence of the inner core on mercury s forced librations on the basis of the currently available observations , other than the fact that very large forced libration amplitude at planetary periods are not suggested by observations .",
    "the amplitude of the long - period forced librations predicted by our model are sufficiently large to be measurable by spacecraft observations of the libration angle of mercury .",
    "this is provided the libration angle is observed for a sufficiently long time window and with a precision of a few arcseconds .",
    "depending on their precision , future measurements of long - period forced librations might then allow us to place useful constraints on the interior structure of mercury . as we have shown in our study",
    ", the combination of parameters ( inner core size , interior profiles of flattening and density , etc ) that can generate a given libration is non - unique .",
    "nevertheless , matching predicted and observed long - period forced librations would reduce the possible parameter space and thus provide valuable information on mercury s interior .",
