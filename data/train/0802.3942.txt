    "the aim of this article is to contribute to the understanding of the global - in - time dispersive properties of solutions to wave equations on schwarzschild black hole backgrounds . precisely , we consider two robust ways to measure dispersion , namely the local energy estimates and the strichartz estimates .",
    "let us begin with the local energy estimates . for solutions to the constant coefficient wave equation in @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "@xmath1 we have the original estimates of morawetz @xcite .",
    "we will reserve the term morawetz estimate for and shall call the latter estimate the morawetz conformal estimate . ]",
    "@xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the angular derivative . to prove this one multiplies the wave equation by the multiplier @xmath4 and integrates by parts . within dyadic spatial regions",
    "one can also control @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "precisely , we have the local energy estimates @xmath8 see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one can also consider the inhomogeneous problem , @xmath9 in view of we define the local energy space @xmath10 for the solution @xmath5 by @xmath11 , \\label{leinf}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 for the inhomogeneous term @xmath13 we introduce a dual type norm @xmath14 then we have :    the solution @xmath5 to satisfies the following estimate : @xmath15    one may ask whether similar bounds also hold for perturbations of the minkowski space - time . indeed , in the case of small long range perturbations the same bounds as above were established very recently by two of the authors , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.2 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 2.23 ) ) ( with no obstacle , @xmath16 ) . see also @xcite , @xcite for related local energy estimates for small perturbations of the dalembertian . for large perturbations",
    "one faces additional difficulties , due on one hand to trapping for large frequencies and on the other hand to eigenvalues and resonances for low frequencies .",
    "the schwarzschild space - time , considered in the present paper , is a very interesting example of a large perturbation of the minkowski space - time , where trapping causes significant difficulties .",
    "the schwarzschild space - time @xmath17 is a spherically symmetric solution to einstein s equations with an additional killing vector field @xmath18 , which models the exterior of a massive spherically symmetric body .",
    "factoring out the @xmath19 component it can be represented via the penrose diagram :    the radius @xmath20 of the @xmath19 spheres is intrinsically determined and is a smooth function on @xmath17 which has a single critical point at the center .",
    "the regions @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the exterior of the black hole , respectively its symmetric twin , and are characterized by the relation @xmath23",
    ". we can represent @xmath21 as @xmath24 with a metric whose line element is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the measure on the sphere @xmath19 .",
    "the killing vector field @xmath18 is given by @xmath27 , which is time - like within @xmath21 .",
    "the differential @xmath28 is intrinsic , but the function @xmath29 is only defined up to translations on @xmath21 .    the regions @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the black hole , respectively its symmetric twin , the white hole , and are characterized by the relation @xmath32 .",
    "the same metric as in can be used .",
    "the killing vector field @xmath18 is still given by @xmath27 , which is now space - like .",
    "light rays can enter the black hole but not leave it . by symmetry light rays can leave the white hole but not enter it .",
    "the surface @xmath33 is called the event horizon . while the singularity at @xmath34 is a true metric singularity , we note that the apparent singularity at @xmath33 is merely a coordinate singularity .",
    "indeed , denote @xmath35 so that @xmath36 and set @xmath37 . then in the @xmath38 coordinates the metric in region @xmath21 is expressed in the form @xmath39 which extends analytically into the black hole region @xmath40 . in particular , given a choice of the function @xmath29 in region @xmath21 , this uniquely determines the function @xmath29 in the region @xmath30 via the same change of coordinates .    in a symmetric fashion",
    "we set @xmath41 .",
    "then in the @xmath42 coordinates the metric is expressed in the form @xmath43 which extends analytically into the white hole region @xmath44 .",
    "one can also introduce global nonsingular coordinates by rewriting the metric in the kruskal - szekeres coordinate system , @xmath45 however , this is of less interest for our purposes here .",
    "further information on the schwarzschild space can be found in a number of excellent texts .",
    "we refer the interested reader to , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as far as the results in this paper are concerned , for large @xmath20 the schwarzschild space - time can be viewed as a small perturbation of the minkowski space - time .",
    "the difficulties in our analysis are caused by the dynamics for small @xmath20 , where trapping occurs .",
    "the presence of trapped rays , i.e. rays which do not escape either to infinity or to the singularity @xmath34 , are known to be a significant obstacle to proving local energy , dispersive , and strichartz estimates and , in some case , are known to necessitate a loss of regularity .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are two places where trapping occurs on the schwarzschild manifold .",
    "the first is the surface @xmath46 which is called the photon sphere .",
    "null geodesics which are initially tangent to the photon sphere will remain on the surface for all times .",
    "microlocally the energy is preserved near such periodic orbits .",
    "however what allows for local energy estimates near the photon sphere is the fact that these periodic orbits are hyperbolic .",
    "the second is at the event horizon @xmath33 , where the trapped geodesics are the vertical ones in the @xmath38 coordinates .",
    "however , this second family of trapped rays turns out to cause no difficulty in the decay estimates since in the high frequency limit the energy decays exponentially along it as @xmath47 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the frequency decays exponentially along the hamilton flow , and in the physics literature it is well - known as the red shift effect .    to describe the decay properties of solutions to the wave equation in the schwarzschild space , it is convenient to use coordinates which make good use of the killing vector field and are nonsingular along the event horizon .",
    "the @xmath38 coordinates would satisfy these requirements",
    ". however the level sets of @xmath48 are null surfaces , which would cause some minor difficulties .",
    "this is why in @xmath49 we introduce the function @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a smooth function of @xmath20 . in the @xmath53 coordinates the metric has the form @xmath54    on the function @xmath52 we impose the following two conditions :    \\(i ) @xmath55 for @xmath23 , with equality for @xmath56 .",
    "\\(ii ) the surfaces @xmath57 are space - like , i.e. @xmath58 the first condition ( i ) insures that the @xmath59 coordinates coincide with the @xmath60 coordinates in @xmath61 .",
    "this is convenient but not required for any of our results .",
    "what is important is that in these coordinates the metric is asymptotically flat as @xmath62 . in the proof of the strichartz estimates",
    ", it is also required that @xmath63 near @xmath46 , which in other words says that we can work in the @xmath64 coordinates near the photon sphere . however",
    ", this may be merely an artifact of our method .",
    "we introduce a symmetric function @xmath65 in @xmath66 , as well as the the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 in @xmath44 , respectively @xmath69 . given a parameter @xmath70 we partition the schwarzschild space into seven regions @xmath71 as in figure  [ f : pdcutoff ] .",
    "the right / left top / bottom regions are @xmath72 @xmath73 the top and bottom regions are @xmath74 and the central region @xmath75 is the remainder of @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , define @xmath76 @xmath77 and similarly for the other regions .    in what follows",
    "we consider the cauchy problem @xmath78 where for convenience we choose the initial surface @xmath79 to be the horizontal surface of symmetry @xmath80 and @xmath81 is smooth , everywhere timelike and equals @xmath18 on @xmath79 outside @xmath75 .",
    "observe that we can not use @xmath18 on all of @xmath79 since it is degenerate at the center ( i.e. on the bifurcate sphere ) .",
    "the equation can be solved as follows :    \\(i ) solve the equation in @xmath75 with cauchy data on @xmath79 . since @xmath75 is compact and has forward and backward space - like boundaries ,",
    "this is a purely local problem .",
    "\\(ii ) solve the equation in @xmath82 with cauchy data on @xmath83 .",
    "the forward boundary of @xmath82 is @xmath84 , which is space - like .",
    "this is the most interesting part , where we are interested in the decay properties as @xmath85 . in a similar manner",
    "solve the equation in @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "\\(iii ) solve the equation in @xmath89 with initial data on the space - like surface @xmath90 . here",
    "one can track the solution up to the singularity and encounter a mix of local and global features .",
    "this part of the analysis in not pursued in the present article .",
    "a significant role in our analysis is played by the killing vector field @xmath18 , which in the @xmath91 coordinates equals @xmath92 .",
    "this is time - like outside the black hole but space - like inside it .",
    "furthermore , it is degenerate at the center . using the killing vector field outside the black hole",
    "we obtain a conserved energy @xmath93 $ ] for solutions @xmath94 to the homogeneous equation @xmath95 . on surfaces @xmath96 in the @xmath64",
    "coordinates the energy @xmath93(t)$ ] has the form @xmath97 = \\int_{s^2 } \\int_{2m}^\\infty \\bigl[{{\\bigl(1-\\frac{2m}{r}\\bigr)}}^{-1}(\\partial_t\\phi)^2 + { { \\bigl(1-\\frac{2m}{r}\\bigr)}}(\\partial_r \\phi)^2+|{{\\not\\negmedspace\\nabla}}\\phi|^2\\bigr]\\ r^2 dr d\\omega.\\ ] ]    since the vector field @xmath18 is degenerate at the center , so is the corresponding energy @xmath98 at @xmath33 .",
    "hence it would be natural to replace it with a nondegenerate energy , which on the initial surface @xmath79 can be expressed as @xmath99(\\sigma_0 ) = \\int_{s^2 } \\int_{2m}^\\infty \\bigl[{{\\bigl(1-\\frac{2m}{r}\\bigr)}}^{-\\frac32}(\\partial_t\\phi)^2 + { { \\bigl(1-\\frac{2m}{r}\\bigr)}}^\\frac12 ( \\partial_r \\phi)^2+|{{\\not\\negmedspace\\nabla}}\\phi|^2\\bigr]\\ r^2 dr d\\omega.\\ ] ] unfortunately this is no longer conserved , and this is one of the difficulties which we face in our analysis .",
    "we remark that a related form of a nondegenerate energy expression was introduced in @xcite and proved to be bounded in the exterior region on surfaces @xmath100 .",
    "part of the novelty of our approach is to prove bounds not only in the exterior region , but also inside the event horizon .",
    "this is natural if one considers the fact that the singularity at @xmath33 is merely a removable coordinate singularity .",
    "in order to do this , it is no longer suitable to measure the evolution of the energy on the surfaces @xmath96 ( see below ) .",
    "thus the above energy @xmath101(\\sigma_0)$ ] is relegated to a secondary role here and is used only to measure the size of the initial data .",
    "a priori the energy @xmath101(t)$ ] of @xmath94 only determines its cauchy data at time @xmath29 modulo constants .",
    "however , in what follows we implicitly assume that @xmath94 decays at @xmath102 , in which case @xmath94 can be also estimated via a hardy - type inequality , @xmath103 this is proved in a standard manner ; the details are left to the reader .",
    "we shall now further describe our main estimates in the region @xmath104 : the local energy decay , the wkb analysis which yields a local energy decay with only a logarithmic loss , and finally the strichartz estimates .    for the initial energy on @xmath83 we use @xmath105(\\sigma_r^- ) = \\int_{\\sigma_r^- }",
    "\\left (     final energy on @xmath84 we set @xmath105(\\sigma_r^+ ) = \\int_{\\sigma_r^+ }   \\left (   |\\partial_r \\phi|^2 +    |\\partial_{{\\tilde{v}}}\\phi|^2     +    we also track the energy on the space - like slices @xmath106 , @xmath105({{\\tilde{v}}}_0 ) = \\int _ { { { \\mathcal}m}_r \\cap \\{{{\\tilde{v}}}= { { \\tilde{v}}}_0\\ } }   \\left (     @xmath101(\\sigma_r^- ) = e[\\phi](0)$ ] .    for the local energy estimates one may first consider a direct analogue of the minkowski bound .",
    "unfortunately such a bound is hopeless due to the trapping which occurs at @xmath46 . instead ,",
    "for our first result we define a weaker preliminary local energy space @xmath107 with norm @xmath108 compared to the @xmath109 norm we note the power loss in the angular and @xmath110 derivatives at @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath107 norm is also weaker than @xmath10 as @xmath62 , but this is merely for convenience .    at the same time we would like to also consider the inhomogeneous problem @xmath112 . to measure the inhomogeneous term @xmath13",
    ", we introduce the norm @xmath113 , which is stronger than @xmath114 : @xmath115 again the important difference is at @xmath111 . our first local energy estimate is the following :    [ theorem.1 ] let @xmath94 solve the inhomogeneous wave equation @xmath112 on the schwarzschild manifold",
    ". then we have @xmath116(\\sigma_r^+ ) + \\sup_{\\tilde v \\geq 0 }      e[\\phi](\\tilde v)+   \\|\\phi\\|_{le_0}^2 \\lesssim e[\\phi](\\sigma_r^- ) + \\|f\\|_{le^*_0}^2.\\ ] ]    here we made no effort to optimize the weights at @xmath46 and @xmath117 .",
    "this is done later in the paper . on the other hand",
    "the above estimate follows from a relatively simple application of the classical positive commutator method .",
    "the advantage of having even such a weaker estimate is that it is sufficient in order to allow localization near the interesting regions @xmath111 and @xmath118 , which can then be studied in greater detail using specific tools .",
    "the first related results regarding the solution of the wave equation on schwarzschild backgrounds were obtained in @xcite and @xcite which proved uniform boundedness in region @xmath21 ( including the event horizon ) . the first pointwise decay result ( without ,",
    "however , a rate of decay ) was obtained in @xcite .",
    "heuristics from @xcite suggest that solutions to the wave equation in the schwarzschild case should locally decay like @xmath119 . for",
    "spherically symmetric data a @xmath120 decay rate was obtained in @xcite , and under the additional assumption of the initial data vanishing near the event horizon , the @xmath119 decay rate was proved in @xcite . in general the best known decay rate , proved in @xcite , is @xmath121 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite , where optimal pointwise decay rates for each spherical harmonic are established for a closely related problem .",
    "estimates related to were first proved in @xcite for radially symmetric schrdinger equations on schwarzschild backgrounds . in @xcite ,",
    "those estimates are extended to allow for general data for the wave equation .",
    "the same authors , in @xcite , have provided studies that give improved estimates near the photon sphere @xmath46 .    moreover",
    ", we note that variants of these bounds have played an important role in the works @xcite and @xcite which prove analogues of the morawetz conformal estimates on schwarzschild backgrounds .",
    "this allows one to deduce a uniform decay rate for the local energy away from the event horizon , though there is necessarily a loss of regularity due to the trapping that occurs at the photon sphere . instead in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to time translation invariant estimates , and we aim to clarify / streamline these as much as possible .",
    "all of the above articles use the conserved ( degenerate ) energy @xmath122 $ ] on time slices , obtained using the killing vector field @xmath123 . as such , their estimates are degenerate near the event horizon .",
    "further progress was made in @xcite , where an additional vector field was introduced near the event horizon , in connection to the red shift effect .",
    "this enabled them to obtain bounds in the exterior region involving a nondegenerate form of the energy related to .",
    "the approach of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite is to write the equation using the regge - wheeler tortoise coordinate and to expand in spherical harmonics . for the equation corresponding to each spherical harmonic ,",
    "one uses a multiplier which changes sign at the critical point of the effective potential .",
    "here we work in the coordinates @xmath59 , though this is not of particular significance , and we do not expand into spherical harmonics .",
    "we prove using a positive commutator argument which requires a single differential multiplier .",
    "we hope that this makes the methods more robust for other potential applications .    during final preparations of this article ,",
    "localized energy estimates proved without using the spherical harmonic decomposition also appeared in @xcite .",
    "the methods contained therein are somewhat different from ours .    compared to the stronger norms",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath124 the weights in have a polynomial singularity at @xmath111 , which corresponds to the family of trapped geodesics on the photon sphere . as a consequence of the results we prove later ,",
    "see theorem  [ theorem.3 ] , the latter fact can be remedied to produce a stronger estimate .",
    "[ theorem.2 ] let @xmath94 solve the inhomogeneous wave equation @xmath112 on the schwarzschild manifold",
    ". then still holds if the coefficient @xmath125 in the @xmath107 and the @xmath126 norms is replaced by @xmath127    now we have only a logarithmic singularity at @xmath46 .",
    "the result above is only stated in this form for the reader s convenience .",
    "the full result in theorem  [ theorem.3 ] is stronger but also more complicated to state since it provides a more precise microlocal local energy estimate .",
    "the logarithmic loss is not surprising , since it is characteristic of geometries with trapped hyperbolic orbits ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , a similar estimate in the semiclassical setting is obtained in @xcite using entirely different techniques .",
    "note , however , that the aforementioned estimate only involves logarithmic loss of the frequency ; our result is stronger since it also implies bounds for @xmath128 , which are necessary in order to prove strichartz estimates .",
    "there are two regions on which the analysis is distinct .",
    "the metric is asymptotically flat , and thus , near infinity , one can retrieve the classical morawetz type estimate .",
    "on the other hand , around the photon sphere @xmath111 we take an expansion into spherical harmonics as well as a time fourier transform .",
    "then it remains to study an ordinary differential equation which is essentially similar to @xmath129 for this we use a rough wkb approximation in the hyperbolic region combined with energy estimates in the elliptic region .",
    "airy type dynamics occur near the zeroes of the potential .    even though it is weaker , the initial bound in theorem  [ theorem.1 ] plays a key role in the analysis .",
    "precisely , it allows us to glue together the estimates in the two regions described above .",
    "we next consider the strichartz estimates . for solutions to the constant coefficient wave equation on @xmath130 , the well - known strichartz estimates state that @xmath131 here the exponents @xmath132 are subject to the scaling relation @xmath133 and the dispersion relation @xmath134 all pairs @xmath135 satisfying and are called strichartz pairs . those for which the equality holds in are called sharp strichartz pairs .",
    "such estimates first appeared in the seminal works @xcite , @xcite and as stated include contributions from , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "if one allows variable coefficients , such estimates are well - understood locally - in - time . for smooth coefficients ,",
    "this was first shown in @xcite and later for @xmath136 coefficients by @xcite and @xcite .    globally - in - time , the problem is more delicate .",
    "even a small , smooth , compactly supported perturbation of the flat metric may refocus a group of rays and produce caustics .",
    "thus , constructing a parametrix for incoming rays proves to be quite difficult . at the same time",
    ", one needs to contend with the possibility of trapped rays at high frequencies and with eigenfunctions / resonances at low frequencies .",
    "global - in - time estimates were shown for small , long range perturbations of the metric in @xcite using an outgoing parametrix . in order to keep the parametrix outgoing one",
    "must allow evolution both forward and backward in time .",
    "this construction is based on an earlier argument in @xcite for the schrdinger equation .",
    "the smallness assumption , however , precludes trapping and does not permit a direct application to the current setup .    on the other hand",
    ", a second result of @xcite asserts that even for large , long range perturbations of the metric one can still establish global - in - time strichartz estimates provided that a strong form of the local energy estimates holds .",
    "this switches the burden to the question of proving local energy estimates .",
    "the result in @xcite can not be applied directly to the present problem due to the logarithmic losses in the local energy estimates near the trapped rays .",
    "however , it can be applied for the near infinity part of the solution . in a bounded spatial region , on the other hand , we take advantage of the local energy estimates to localize the problem to bounded sets , in which estimates are shown using the local - in - time strichartz estimates of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain    [ strichartz.theorem ] if @xmath94 solves @xmath112 in @xmath82 then for all nonsharp strichartz pairs @xmath137 and @xmath138 we have @xmath105(\\sigma_r^+ ) + \\sup_{{{\\tilde{v } } } } e[\\phi]({{\\tilde{v } } } ) +   \\left\\| \\nabla \\phi\\right\\|^2_{l^{p_1}_{{\\tilde{v}}}\\dot h^{-\\rho_1,q_1}_x }   \\lesssim e[\\phi](\\sigma_r^- ) + \\left\\| f \\right\\|^2_{l^{p_2'}_{{\\tilde{v}}}\\dot h^{\\rho_2 , q_2'}_x } .\\ ] ]    here the sobolev - type spaces @xmath139 coincide with the usual @xmath139 homogeneous spaces in @xmath140 expressed in polar coordinates @xmath141 .    as a corollary of this result one can consider the global solvability question for the energy critical semilinear wave equation in the schwarzschild space , @xmath142    [ tnlw ] let @xmath143 .",
    "then there exists @xmath144 so that for each initial data @xmath145 which satisfies @xmath105(\\sigma_0 ) \\leq \\epsilon\\ ] ] the equation admits an unique solution @xmath94 in the region @xmath146 which satisfies the bound @xmath105(\\sigma_{r_0 } ) + \\| \\phi \\|_{\\dot h^{s , p}(\\{r > r_0\\ } ) }   \\lesssim e[\\phi](\\sigma_0)\\ ] ] for all indices @xmath147 satisfying @xmath148 furthermore , the solution has a lipschitz dependence on the initial data in the above topology .",
    "some further clarification is needed for the function space @xmath149 appearing above , in view of the ambiguity due to the choice of coordinates . in a compact neighbourhood of the center region",
    "@xmath75 this is nothing but the classical @xmath150 norm . by compactness ,",
    "different choices of coordinates lead to equivalent norms .",
    "consider now the upper exterior region @xmath82 ( as well as its three other mirror images ) .",
    "using the coordinates @xmath151 with @xmath152 , we define @xmath153 as the restrictions to @xmath154 of functions in the homogeneous sobolev space @xmath155 .",
    "* acknowledgements : * the authors are grateful to m. dafermos and i. rodnianski for pointing out their novel way of taking advantage of the red shift effect in @xcite , and to n. burq and m. zworski for useful conversations concerning the analysis near trapped null geodesics .",
    "in this section , we shall prove theorem [ theorem.1 ] .",
    "we note that the estimate is trivial over a finite @xmath110 interval by energy estimates for the wave equation ; the difficulty consists in proving a global bound in @xmath110 . by the same token ,",
    "once we prove for some choice of @xmath156 , we can trivially make the transition to any @xmath156 due to the local theory .",
