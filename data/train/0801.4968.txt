    "thus , our snia rate is consistent with both the rate in early - type galaxies , @xmath85 @xcite , and the low redshift cluster rate from woots , @xmath86 @xcite .",

    "since cluster galaxies are predominantly early - type , both of these effects dominate in clusters : the first effect decreases the number expected in clusters by @xmath87 , but quantifying the second would require more detailed completeness simulations .",
    "both effects would cause us to underestimate the rate of sneia in clusters relative to the field .      to avoid these effects and the morphology - density relation , we limit the galaxy sample to two subsets : all early - type galaxies , and the brightest population of early - type galaxies ( those with @xmath88 like brightest cluster galaxies , bcgs ) .",

    "detection efficiency corrections are performed as described above , with the final results and rates presented in table [ ts4ncorria ] .",
    "although these samples are more sensitive to the two detection efficiency biases affecting early - type galaxies (   [ ss4rates ] ) , limiting all galaxies to early - types minimizes differences between the clusters and the field and results in a more meaningful test .",
    "the results , although not statistically significant , are _ suggestive _ of the rate enhancement in cluster over field early - type galaxies established by mannucci et al .",

    "<S> the canada - france - hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey ( snls ) has created a large homogeneous database of intermediate redshift ( @xmath0 ) type ia supernovae ( sneia ) . </S>",
    "<S> the snls team has shown that correlations exist between sn ia rates , properties , and host galaxy star formation rates . </S>",
    "<S> the snls snia database has now been combined with a photometric redshift galaxy catalog and an optical galaxy cluster catalog to investigate the possible influence of galaxy clustering on the snia rate , over and above the expected effect due to the dependence of sfr on clustering through the morphology - density relation . </S>",
    "<S> we identify three cluster sneia , plus three additional possible cluster sneia , and find the snia rate per unit mass in clusters at intermediate redshifts is consistent with the rate per unit mass in field early - type galaxies and the snia cluster rate from low redshift cluster targeted surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the number of sneia in cluster environments to be within a factor of two of expectations from the two component snia rate model . </S>"
