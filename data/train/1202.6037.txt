    "diagnostic sonography allows visualization of body tissues , by radiating them with acoustic energy pulses , which are transmitted from an array of transducer elements .",
    "the image typically comprises multiple scanlines , each constructed by integrating data collected by the transducers , following the transmission of an energy pulse along a narrow beam . as the pulse propagates",
    ", echoes are scattered by density and propagation - velocity perturbations in the tissue  @xcite , and detected by the transducer elements . averaging the detected signals , after their alignment with appropriate time - varying delays , allows localization of the scattering structures , while improving the signal to noise ratio ( snr )  @xcite .",
    "the latter process is referred to as beamforming .",
    "performed digitally , beamforming requires that the analog signals , detected by the transducers , first be sampled . confined to classic nyquist - shannon sampling theorem  @xcite",
    ", the sampling rate must be at least twice the bandwidth , in order to avoid aliasing .",
    "as imaging techniques develop , the amount of elements involved in each imaging cycle typically increases .",
    "consequently , the rates of data which need to be transmitted from the system front - end , and then processed by the beamformer , grow significantly . the growth in transmission and processing rates",
    "inevitably effects both machinery size and power consumption .",
    "consequently , in recent years there has been growing interest in reducing the amounts of data as close as possible to the system front - end .",
    "in fact , such reduction is already possible within the classical sampling framework : state of the art devices digitally downsample the data at the front - end , by exploiting the fact that the signal is modulated onto a carrier , so that the spectrum essentially occupies only a portion of its entire base - band bandwidth .",
    "the preliminary sample rate remains unchanged , since the demodulation is performed in the digital domain .",
    "nevertheless , a key to significant data compression lies beyond the classical sampling framework .    indeed ,",
    "the emerging compressive sensing ( cs ) framework  @xcite states , that sparse signals may be accurately reconstructed from a surprisingly small amount of coefficients .",
    "complementary ideas rise from the finite rate of innovation ( fri ) framework  @xcite , in which the signal is assumed to have a finite number of degrees of freedom per unit time .",
    "many classes of fri signals can be recovered from samples taken at the rate of innovation  @xcite . for a detailed review of previously proposed fri methods ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite . combining the latter notions with classical sampling methods , the developing xampling framework  @xcite involves methods for fully capturing the information carried by an analog signal , by sampling it far below the nyquist - rate .    following the spirit of xampling ,",
    "al . proposed in  @xcite , that ultrasound signals be described within the fri framework .",
    "explicitly , they assume that these signals , formed by scattering of a transmitted pulse from multiple reflectors , may be modeled by a relatively small number of pulses , all replicas of some known pulse shape . denoting the number of reflected pulses by @xmath0 , and the signal s finite temporal support by @xmath1 , the detected signal is completely defined by @xmath2 degrees of freedom , corresponding to the replicas unknown time delays and amplitudes . based on  @xcite , the authors formulate the relationship between the signal s fourier series coefficients , calculated with respect to @xmath1 , and its unknown parameters , in the form of a spectral analysis problem .",
    "the latter may be solved using existing techniques , given a subset of fourier series coefficients , with a minimal cardinality of @xmath2 .",
    "the sampling scheme is thus reduced to the problem of extracting a small subset of the detected signal s frequency samples .",
    "two robust schemes are derived in @xcite , extracting such a set of coefficients from samples of the signal , taken at sub - nyquist rates .",
    "the system presented in @xcite employs a single processing channel , in which the analog signal is filtered by an appropriate sampling kernel and then sampled with a standard low - rate analog to digital converter ( adc ) .",
    "the method of  @xcite employs multiple processing channels , each comprising a modulator and an integrator .",
    "these approaches were shown to be more robust than previous fri techniques and also allow for arbitrary pulse shapes .",
    "the initial motivation for our work stems from the need to translate the ultrasound xampling scheme proposed in @xcite , into one which achieves the final goal of reconstructing a two - dimensional ultrasound image , by integrating data sampled at multiple transducer elements . in conventional ultrasound imaging , such integration is achieved by the beamforming process .",
    "the question is how may we implement beamforming , using samples of the detected signals taken at sub - nyquist rates .",
    "a straightforward approach is to replace the nyquist - rate sampling mechanism , utilized in each receiver element , by an fri xampling scheme .",
    "having estimated the parametric representation of the signal detected in each individual element , we could reconstruct it digitally .",
    "the reconstructed signals can then be further processed via beamforming .",
    "however , the nature of ultrasound signals reflected from real tissues , makes such an approach impractical .",
    "this is mainly due to the detected signals poor snr , which results in erroneous parameter extraction by the xampling scheme , applied to each element independently .",
    "our approach is to generalize the fri xampling scheme proposed in  @xcite , such that it integrates beamforming into the low - rate sampling process .",
    "the result is equivalent to that obtained by xampling the beamformed signal , which exhibits significantly better snr .",
    "furthermore , beamforming practically implies that the array of receivers is dynamically focused along a single scanline .",
    "consequently , the resulting signal depicts reflections originating in the intersection of the radiated medium with a vary narrow beam .",
    "such a signal better suits the fri model proposed in  @xcite , which assumes the reflections to be caused by isolated , point - like scatterers .",
    "we refer to our scheme by the term compressed beamforming , as it transforms the beamforming operator into the compressed domain  @xcite .",
    "applied to real cardiac ultrasound data obtained from a ge breadboard ultrasonic scanner , our approach successfully images macroscopic perturbations in the tissue while achieving a nearly eight - fold reduction in sampling rate , compared to standard imaging techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:02 ] , we summarize the general principles of beamforming in ultrasound imaging . in section [ sec:03 ]",
    "we outline the fri model and its contribution to sample rate reduction in the ultrasound context .",
    "we motivate compressed beamforming in section [ sec:04 ] , considering the nature of ultrasound signals reflected from biological tissues .",
    "beamforming and fri xampling are combined in section [ sec:05 ] , where we propose that the signal obtained by beamforming may be treated within the fri framework . following this observation",
    ", we derive our first compressed beamforming scheme , which operates on low - rate samples taken at the individual receivers .",
    "this approach is then further simplified in section [ sec:06 ] .",
    "in section [ sec:07 ] we focus on image reconstruction from the parametric representation obtained by either xampling scheme . in this context",
    ", we generalize the signal model proposed in @xcite , allowing additional unknown phase shifts of the detected pulses .",
    "we then discuss an alternative recovery approach , based on cs .",
    "simulations comparing the performance of several recovery methods are provided in section [ sec:08 ] .",
    "finally , experimental results obtained for cardiac ultrasound data are presented in section [ sec:09 ] .",

    "@xmath5 denotes the distance measured from the reference receiver to the @xmath6th receiver .",

    "echoes are then reflected from perturbations in the radiated medium.,width=207 ]    in this section , we describe a typical b - mode imaging cycle , focusing on the beamforming process , carried out during the reception phase .",
    "the latter constitutes a significant block in ultrasound imaging , and plays a major role in our proposed fri xampling scheme .",
    "consider the array depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] , comprising @xmath8 transducer elements , aligned along the @xmath3 axis .",
    "denote by @xmath5 the distance from the @xmath6th element to the reference receiver @xmath4 , used as the origin , namely @xmath9 .",
    "the imaging cycle begins when , at time @xmath10 , the array transmits acoustic energy into the tissue .",
    "subsequently , the elements detect echoes , which originate in density and propagation - velocity perturbations , characterizing the radiated medium .",
    "denote by @xmath11 the signal detected by the @xmath6th receiver .",
    "the acoustic reciprocity theorem  @xcite suggests , that we may use the signals detected by multiple transducer elements , in order to probe arbitrary coordinates for reflected energy .",
    "namely , by combining the detected signals with appropriate time delays , echoes scattered from a chosen coordinate will undergo constructive interference , whereas those originating off this coordinate will be attenuated , due to destructive interference .    in practice",
    ", the array can not effectively radiate the entire medium simultaneously . instead",
    ", a pulse of energy is conducted along a relatively narrow beam , whose central axis forms an angle @xmath7 with the @xmath12 axis .",
    "focusing the energy pulse along such a beam is achieved by applying appropriate time delays to modulated acoustic pulses , transmitted from multiple array elements . rather than arbitrarily probing the radiated tissue ,",
    "we are now forced to adjust the probed coordinate in time , in coordination with the propagation of the transmitted energy .",
    "this practically implies that , combining the detected signals with appropriate time - varying delays , we may obtain a signal , which depicts the intensity of the energy reflected from each point along the central transmission axis . throughout the rest of this section",
    ", we derive an explicit expression for creating this beamformed signal .",
    "assume that the energy pulse , transmitted at @xmath10 , propagates at velocity @xmath13 in the direction @xmath7 . at time @xmath14",
    ", the pulse crosses the coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "consider a potential reflection , originating in this coordinate , and arriving at the @xmath6th element .",
    "the distance traveled by such a reflection is : @xmath16 the time in which the reflection crosses this distance is @xmath17 , so that it reaches the receiver element at time @xmath18 it is readily seen that @xmath19 . hence , in order to align the reflection detected in the @xmath6th receiver with the one detected in the reference receiver , we need to apply a delay to @xmath11 , such that the resulting signal , @xmath20 , satisfies @xmath21 .",
    "denoting @xmath22 , and using , we obtain the following distorted signal for @xmath14 : @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the aligned signals may now be averaged , resulting in the beamformed signal @xmath25 which exhibits enhanced snr compared to @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , by its construction , @xmath27 represents , for every @xmath14 , the intensity which was measured when focusing the array to @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , it may eventually be translated into an intensity pattern , plotted along the corresponding ray .",
    "although defined over continuous time , ultrasound systems perform the process formulated in - in the digital domain , requiring that the analog signals @xmath11 first be sampled . confined to the classic nyquist - shannon sampling theorem , these systems sample the signals at twice their baseband bandwidth , in order to avoid aliasing .",
    "the detected signals typically occupy only a portion of their baseband bandwidth .",
    "exploiting this fact , some state of the art systems manage to reduce the amount of samples transmitted from the front - end , by down - sampling the data , after demodulation and low - pass filtering .",
    "however , since such operations are carried out digitally , the preliminary sampling - rate remains unchanged .    to conclude this section",
    ", we evaluate the nominal number of samples needed to be taken from each active receiver element in order to obtain a single scanline using standard imaging techniques .",
    "consider an ultrasound system which images to a nominal depth of @xmath29 .",
    "the velocity at which the pulse propagates , @xmath13 , varies between @xmath30 ( fat ) to @xmath31 ( spleen )  @xcite .",
    "an average value of @xmath32 is assumed by scanners for processing purposes , such that the duration of the detected signal is @xmath33 .",
    "the signal s baseband bandwidth requires a nominal sampling rate of @xmath34 , resulting in an overall number of @xmath35 real - valued samples . assuming that the signal s passband bandwidth is only @xmath36 , the data sampled at nyquist - rate may be finally down - sampled to 1680 real - valued samples .",
    "these samples , taken from all active receivers , are now processed , according to - , in order to construct the beamformed signal . since standard imaging devices carry out beamforming by applying delay and sum operations to the sampled data , the amount of operations required for generating a single scanline is directly related to the sample rate .",
    "regardless of our computational power , physical constraints imply that the time required for constructing a single scanline is at least @xmath37 .",
    "this takes into account the round - trip time required for the transmitted pulse to penetrate the entire imaging depth , and for the resulting echoes to cross a similar distance back to the array .",
    "nevertheless , sufficient computational power may allow construction of several scanlines , within that same time interval , increasing the overall imaging rate . by using compressed beamforming , we aim at capturing significant information in the imaging plane , while reducing the sampling rate and consequently the processing rate .",
    "this , in turn , may improve the existing trade - off between imaging rates and both machinery size and power consumption .",
    "in a pioneer attempt to implement xampling methodology in the context of ultrasound imaging , @xcite suggests that the signal detected in each receiver element may be sampled at a rate far below nyquist , by modeling it as an fri signal .",
    "the authors propose that @xmath11 , detected in the @xmath6th element , be regarded as sum of a relatively small number of pulses , all replicas of some known pulse shape .",
    "explicitly : @xmath38 here @xmath0 is the number of scattering elements , distributed throughout the sector radiated by the transmitted pulse , @xmath39 denotes the time in which the reflection from the @xmath40th element arrived at the @xmath6th receiver , and @xmath41 denotes the reflection s amplitude , as detected by the @xmath6th receiver .",

    ", we conclude that , as long as @xmath71 , such a xampling method may indeed achieve a substantial rate reduction .",
    "applied to a single receiver element , the xampling scheme proposed in  @xcite achieves good signal reconstruction for an actual ultrasound signal , reflected from a setup of phantom targets . in principle",
    ", we could apply this approach to each receiver element individually , resulting in a parametric representation for each of the signals @xmath72 .",
    "being able to digitally reconstruct the detected signals , we could then proceed with the standard beamforming process , outlined in section [ sec:02 ] , aimed at constructing the corresponding scanline .",
    "computational effort would have been reduced , by limiting the beamforming process to the support of the estimated pulses .",
    "in fact , we could possibly bypass the beamforming stage , by deriving a geometric model which maps the set of delays , @xmath73 , associated with the @xmath40th reflector , to its two - dimensional position @xmath74 . however , applying the proposed fri xampling scheme to signals reflected from biological tissues , we face two fundamental obstacles : low snr and proper interpretation of the estimated signal parameters , considering the profile of the transmitted beam .",
    "these two difficulties may be better understood by examining fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] , which depicts traces acquired for cardiac images of a healthy consenting volunteer using a ge breadboard ultrasonic scanner .",
    "( a )        ( b )    in the left plot ( a ) , are signals detected by 32 of 64 active array elements , following the transmission of a single pulse .",
    "the pulse was conducted along a narrow beam , forming an arbitrary angle @xmath7 with the @xmath12 axis .",
    "the right plot ( b ) depicts the signal obtained by applying beamforming to the detected signals , as outlined in section [ sec:02 ] . examining the individual traces , one notices the appearance of strong pulses , possibly overlapping , characterized by a typical shape , as proposed in .",
    "let us assume that we could indeed extract the delays and amplitudes of these pulses , by applying the proposed fri xampling scheme to each element .",
    "we suggested that beamforming could be bypassed , by deriving a geometric model for estimating the two - dimensional position of a scattering element , based on the delays of pulses associated with it , yet estimated in different receivers . in order to apply such a model",
    ", we must first be able to match corresponding pulses across the detected signals .",
    "however , referring to the practical case depicted in ( a ) , we notice that such a task is not at all trivial - the individual signals depict reflections , originating from the entire sector , radiated by the transmitted pulse .",
    "these reflections may , therefore , vary significantly across traces .",
    "in fact , some pulses , visible in several traces , are not at all apparent in other traces .",
    "in contrast , the beamformed signal , by its construction , depicts intensity of reflections originating from along the central transmission axis , while attenuating reflections originating off this axis .    attempting to apply fri xampling to each receiver element individually , we encounter an even more fundamental obstacle , at the earlier stage of extracting the signal s parametric representation from its low - rate samples .",
    "the individual traces contain high levels of noise .",
    "the noisy components , especially noticeable in traces 54 and 64 , rise mainly from constructive and destructive interference of acoustic waves , reflected by dense , sub - wavelength scatterers in the tissue .",
    "the latter are typically manifested as granular texture in the ultrasound image , called speckle , after a similar effect in laser optics  @xcite .",
    "the noisy components inherently induce erroneous results , when attempting to sample and reconstruct the fri components using the xampling approach . in extreme scenarios , where the noise masks the fri component ,",
    "the extracted parameters will be meaningless , such that any attempt to cope with errors in the parametric domain will turn out useless .",
    "the motivation to our approach rises from the observation , that we may resolve the aforementioned obstacles by xampling the beamformed signal , @xmath27 , rather than the individual signals @xmath11 .",
    "whereas beamforming is a fundamental process in ultrasound imaging since its early days , our innovation regards its integration into the xampling process .",
    "we derive our compressed beamforming approach , beginning with conceptual xampling of the beamformed signal , using the scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "we then show that an equivalent result may be obtained from low - rate samples of the individual signals @xmath11 .",
    "a necessary condition for implementing our approach is that @xmath27 , generated from @xmath72 satisfying , is also fri of similar form . examining fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] we notice that @xmath27 exhibits a structure similar to that of the individual signals , comprising strong pulses of typical shape , which may overlap . in this case , there are several obvious advantages in xampling @xmath27 .",
    "first , since @xmath72 are averaged in @xmath27 ( after appropriate distortion , derived from the acoustic reciprocity theorem ) it naturally exhibits enhanced snr with respect to the individual signals .",
    "the attenuation of noise in the beamformed signal , compared to the individual signals , is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] , especially in the interval @xmath75 .",
    "second , @xmath27 is directly related to an individual scanline .",
    "this means that we are no longer bothered with the ambiguous problem of matching pulses across signals detected in different elements .",
    "finally , recall that the signal model derived in assumes isolated point - reflectors .",
    "such a model is better justified with respect to @xmath27 since , by narrowing the effective width of the imaging beam , we may indeed approximate its intersection with reflecting structures to be point - like .",
    "this effect is noticeable in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] where some pulses , visible in individual traces , appear attenuated in the beamformed signal .",
    "such pulses correspond to reflectors located off the central axis of the transmission beam .    in the next section ,",
    "we focus on justifying the assumption that @xmath27 may be treated within the fri framework .",
    "an additional challenge , implied in section [ sec:02 ] , regards the fact that @xmath27 does not exist in the analog domain - standard ultrasound devices generate it digitally , from samples of the signals detected in multiple receiver elements , taken at the nyquist - rate .",
    "our goal is , therefore , to derive a scheme , which manages to estimate the necessary samples of @xmath27 , from low - rate samples of filtered versions of @xmath72 .",
    "our approach is based on the assumption that the fri scheme , outlined in section [ sec:03 ] , may be applied to the beamformed signal @xmath27 , constructed according to - .",
    "the latter exhibits much better snr than signals detected in individual receiver elements .",
    "additionally , it depicts reflections originating from a sector much narrower than the one radiated by the transmission beam .",
    "its translation into a single scanline is therefore straightforward . in section [ sec:51 ]",
    "we prove that if the signals @xmath11 obey the fri model , then @xmath27 is * approximately * of the form : @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the time in which the reflection from the @xmath40th element arrived at the reference receiver , indexed @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath27 may thus be sampled using the xampling schemes derived in @xcite . in practice , we can not sample @xmath27 directly , since it does not exist in the analog domain . in second [ sec:52 ]",
    "we show how the desired low - rate samples of @xmath27 can be determined from samples of @xmath11 .      throughout this section",
    "we apply three reasonable assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath78 .",
    "practically , such a constraint may be forced by appropriate apodization , as often performed in ultrasound imaging .",
    "namely , @xmath11 is combined in @xmath27 only for @xmath79 . as an example , for the breadboard ultrasonic scanner used in our experiments , the array comprised @xmath80 receiver elements , distanced @xmath81 apart .",
    "the proposed apodization implies that the receivers located farthest from the origin are combined in the beamformed signal for imaging depth greater than @xmath82 .",
    "second , we assume the two - way pulse , @xmath83 , to be compactly supported on the interval @xmath84 . finally , we assume that @xmath85",
    ". the last assumption may also be forced by appropriate apodization . as an example , the nominal duration of the pulse acquired by the breadboard ultrasonic scanner used in our experiments was @xmath86 . in this case , echoes scattered from depth greater than @xmath87 already satisfy @xmath88 .",
    "suppose that @xmath11 can be written as in .",
    "applying the beamforming distortion , we get @xmath89 the resulting signal comprises @xmath0 pulses , which are distorted versions of the two - way pulse @xmath42 .",
    "suppose that some of the pulses originated in reflectors located off the central beam axis .",
    "beamforming implies that , once averaging the distorted signals according to , such pulses will be attenuated due to destructive interference .",
    "being interested in the structure of the beamformed signal @xmath27 , we are therefore concerned only with pulses which originated in reflectors located along the central beam . for convenience , we assume that all pulses in satisfy this property ( pulses which do not satisfy it , will vanish in @xmath27 )",
    ". we may thus use @xmath90 , defined in , in order to express @xmath39 in terms of @xmath77 . substituting @xmath91 into @xmath90 , we get @xmath92 , so that becomes @xmath93 where we defined @xmath94 .",
    "applying our second assumption , the support of @xmath95 is defined by the requirement that @xmath96 using and , it is readily seen that @xmath95 is supported on @xmath97 , where @xmath98    further applying our assumption that @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath99 .    we have thus proven that @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",

    "additionally , assuming that the support of @xmath11 is contained in @xmath1 , we show in the appendix that there exists @xmath122 , such that the support of @xmath27 is contained in @xmath123 and , additionally , @xmath124 .",
    "as @xmath125 grows towards @xmath77 , @xmath126 decreases , resulting in a larger distortion of the @xmath40th pulse .",
    "consequently , the approximation of @xmath127 as a sum of shifted replicas of the two - way pulse becomes less accurate .",
    "the xampling schemes used by @xcite rely on the projection of the detected signal onto a subspace of its fourier series coefficients .",

    "this process is performed numerically , off - line , based on our imaging setup .",
    "consequently , we construct @xmath340 off - line , according to . choosing this level of approximation",
    ", we end up with a seven - fold reduction in sample rate , where , for the construction of a single scanline , an average of @xmath341 complex samples must be taken from each element .",
    "we point out that in this scenario , the maximal number of samples , taken from certain elements , reaches @xmath342 for specific values of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , if a common rate is to be used for all sensors , for all values of @xmath7 , we may still achieve a six - fold reduction in sample rate .",
    "as before , we use omp in order to obtain @xmath27 s parametric representation , and reconstruct it based on our generalized fri model proposed in .",
    "the resulting image ( c ) appears very similar to ( b ) .",
    "table [ tab:01 ] gathers snr values , calculated for the beamformed signals estimated using both our xampling schemes , after envelope detection with the hilbert transform .",
    "the values were calculated with respect to the envelopes of the beamformed signals , obtained by standard imaging .",
    "explicitly , let @xmath343 denote the beamformed signal obtained by standard beamforming along the direction @xmath344 , @xmath345 , let @xmath346 denote the beamformed signal reconstructed from the parameters recovered by compressed beamforming along the same direction , and let @xmath347 denote the hilbert transform . for the set of @xmath348 scanlines , we defined the snr as @xmath349 this calculation was repeated when reconstructing the signals without the random phase assumption , proposed in section  [ sec:71 ] . for the latter case , reconstruction of a real - valued @xmath346 , given",
    "complex coefficients , may be heuristically achieved by either ignoring the coefficients imaginary part , or by taking their modulus .",
    "it may be seen that , weighting over all @xmath350 beamformed signals , the random phase assumption achieves a relatively minor improvement ( @xmath351-@xmath352 ) compared to reconstruction using the modulus of the coefficients . however , when examining individual signals , we observed that , for certain values of @xmath344 , the improvement exceeded @xmath353 .",
    ".snr in [ db ] of @xmath27 obtained with the proposed xampling schemes and three reconstruction methods [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab:01 ] .",
    "we emphasize , that the calculated snr values provide a useful measure for quantitatively comparing the different xampling and reconstruction approaches .",
    "however , they are of smaller value when attempting to evaluate the overall performance of xampling , compared to standard imaging : recall that our scheme is aimed at reproducing only strong pulses , reflected from macroscopic reflectors . the reference signal , on the other hand , generated by standard technique ,",
    "already contains the additional speckle component , caused by multiple microscopic perturbations .",
    "a possible approach for evaluating the overall performance of either xampling scheme , would be to examine its success rate in recovering strong reflections , detected by standard beamforming .",
    "for this purpose , we tracked the @xmath0 strongest local maxima in each beamformed signal .",
    "if the xampling scheme recovered a pulse within the range of @xmath354 from a certain maximum , we say that this maximum was successfully detected .",
    "certain pulses , detected by xampling , may match more than one maximum in the beamformed signal .",
    "in such case , we choose the one - to - one mapping which achieves smallest mse . applying this evaluation method to signals xampled using our approximated scheme , and reconstructed with the random phase assumption ,",
    "we conclude that the reconstruction successfully retrieves @xmath355 of the significant maxima , with standard deviation of the error being approximately @xmath356 .",
    "in this work , we generalized the xampling method proposed in @xcite , to a scheme applied to an array of multiple receiving elements , allowing reconstruction of a two - dimensional ultrasound image . at the heart of this generalization was the proposal that the one - dimensional xampling method derived in @xcite be applied to signals obtained by beamforming .",
    "such signals exhibit enhanced snr , compared to the individual signals detected by the array elements .",
    "moreover , they depict reflections which originate in a much narrower sector , than that initially radiated by the transmitted pulse . a second key observation , which made our approach feasible , regarded the integration of the beamforming process into the filtering part of the xampling scheme .    the first approach we purposed comprised multiple modulation and integration channels , utilizing analog kernels .",
    "we next showed that the parametric representation of the beamformed signal may be well approximated , from projections of the detected signals onto appropriate subsets of their fourier series coefficients .",
    "the contribution of our schemes regards both the reduction in sample rate , but additionally , the resulting reduction in the rate of data transmission from the system front - end to the processing unit . in particular , our second approach is significant even when preliminary sampling is performed at the nyquist - rate .",
    "in such a case , it allows a reduction in data transmission rate , by a relatively simple linear transformation , applied to the sampled data .",
    "an additional contribution of our work regards the method by which we reconstruct the ultrasound signal , assumed to obey a specific fri structure , from a subset of its frequency samples . rather than using traditional spectral analysis techniques",
    ", we formulate the relationship between the signal s samples to its unknown parameters as a cs problem .",
    "the latter may be efficiently solved using a greedy algorithm such as the omp .",
    "we show that , in our scenario , cs is generally comparable to spectral analysis methods , managing to achieve similar success rates with sample sets of equal cardinality .",
    "moreover , working in a noisy regime , cs typically outperformed spectral analysis methods , provided that the frequency samples were highly spread over the essential spectrum of the signal .",
    "using actual cardiac data , a relatively large number of reflectors was assumed .",
    "consequently , by simply choosing the fourier series coefficients consecutively , as in the spectral analysis techniques , we end up with the necessary wide distribution .",
    "however , as shown in our simulations , cs approach inherently allows a wide distribution of samples , even when the cardinality of the sample set is small , since we are not obliged to unique configurations of samples .",
    "a final observation discussed in our work , regards the generalization of the signal model proposed in @xcite , allowing additional , unknown phase shifts , of the detected pulses .",
    "we show that these shifts may be estimated by appropriate interpretation of the extracted coefficients , without changing the recovery method .    combining the random phase assumption with our proposed xampling schemes and the cs recovery method ,",
    "we construct two - dimensional ultrasound images , which well depict strong perturbations in the tissue , while achieving up to seven - fold reduction of sample rate , compared to standard imaging techniques .",
    "we assume @xmath42 to be supported on @xmath84 , and that the support of @xmath11 is contained in @xmath1 .",
    "the last assumption may be justified by the fact that the pulse is transmitted at @xmath10 , such that reflections may only be detected for @xmath357 .",
    "additionally , the penetration depth of the transmitted pulse allows us to set @xmath37 , such that all reflections arriving at @xmath358 are below the noise level .    for all @xmath359 and @xmath360 :",
    "@xmath361 applying the relation @xmath92 , justified in section  [ sec:51 ] , and using the fact that @xmath90 is non - decreasing for @xmath357 we conclude that @xmath362 @xmath363 being the inverse of @xmath90 .",
    "explicitly : @xmath364 assuming that @xmath365 , then , since is true for every @xmath366 , we may write : @xmath367 this allows us to set the following upper bound on the support of @xmath27 : @xmath368 once again , using the assumption that @xmath365 . from it",
    "is readily seen that @xmath369 , since we can always find @xmath125 with sign opposite to that of @xmath370 , such that : @xmath371 finally , by construction of @xmath372 we see that , for all @xmath360 , @xmath373 .",
