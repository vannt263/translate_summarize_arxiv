    "astronomers have been waiting for sometime for a planet remotely similar to our own earth that could be readily investigated with current instruments .",
    "such an object was recently announced with the seminal discovery of the super - earth planet gj 1214b @xcite with the mearth telescope network @xcite .",
    "although not the first transiting super - earth announced ",
    "corot-7b arguably holds that honour @xcite  gj 1214b is in many ways more interesting as it offers the opportunity for advantageous follow - up to constrain its planetary characteristics . with a mass of 6.55 @xmath7 and a radius of 2.68 @xmath8 ,",
    "gj 1214b s density ( @xmath9@xmath01.87 g @xmath10 ; @xcite ) is less than that of the terrestrial planets of our solar system and therefore gj 1214b may have a significant gaseous atmosphere .",
    "also , as it transits a low mass star , its equilibrium temperature ( @xmath11@xmath0500k assuming a low bond albedo ) is much more hospitable than corot-7b , and it has a much more favourable planet - to - star radius ratio ; as a result , if there are significant spectral features in its atmosphere then they should be detectable with current instruments .",
    "as there are no super - earth analogues in our solar system , it is a pressing question whether the burgeoning class of planets with minimum masses below 10@xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ) are predominantly scaled - down neptunes , with large helium - hydrogen atmospheric envelopes , or scaled - up terrestrial planets with atmospheres predominately composed of heavier molecules .",
    "fortunately , gj 1214b is an ideal candidate to answer such questions ; @xcite showed that due to gj 1214b s advantageous scale - height and planet - to - star radius ratio it should have readily observable water and methane spectral features across the infrared spectrum if its atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium .",
    "conversely , if its atmosphere is composed predominantly of heavier molecules , then the resulting smaller scale height will mute the spectral features and current instruments will return transit depths consistent with the depths measured in the optical by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent theoretical work has shown that measurements to constrain the composition of the gaseous atmosphere of gj 1214b will also constrain the planet s bulk composition .",
    "@xcite and later @xcite showed that the observed mass and radius @xcite can be equally well fit by either a significant rocky core / mantle and a hydrogen - rich atmosphere , or a `` water - world '' with a small water - rich core and a significant steam atmosphere .",
    "searches for spectral features will differentiate between these two scenarios ; detections of prominent spectral features will argue for the former scenario of a rocky core to go along with the hydrogen / helium - rich gaseous planetary envelope .",
    "recently , @xcite have performed just such transit spectroscopy observations using the fors2 instrument on the vlt ; @xcite obtained 11 spectrophotometric light curves from 0.78 - 1.0 @xmath1 that show consistent transit depths with one another . by comparing to the @xcite atmospheric models they were able to show that the lack of observed spectral features suggest that gj 1214b must either have a high mean molecular weight and is likely a water - world , or its atmosphere is hydrogen / helium dominated with hazes or clouds high in the atmosphere that obscure the expected spectral features shortward of @xmath01 micron",
    ". an additional possibility could certainly be that gj 1214b s atmosphere is more complicated than expected , and its atmosphere could still be hydrogen / helium dominated with different spectral features than the @xcite models suggest .",
    "we have also performed broadband transmission spectroscopy observations searching for gj 1214b s spectral features from @xmath01 - 2.5 microns using the wide - field infrared camera ( wircam ) on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "we have already successfully demonstrated the precision of wircam on cfht in the near - infrared through our detections of the secondary eclipses and thermal emission for tres-2b and tres-3b in the ks - band @xcite , and for wasp-12b in the j , h & ks - bands @xcite .",
    "here we report observations of several transits of the super - earth gj 1214b in three bands with wircam on cfht ; for each transit we observed near - simultaneously in two bands to allow for accurate comparisons of the transit depths between these two bands .",
    "we observe an increased transit depth in the ks - band as compared to the j - band depth , likely indicative of absorption near @xmath02.15 @xmath12 m .",
    "the only way to achieve an absorption feature this prominent is if gj 1214b has a large scale height , a low mean molecular weight , and thus its atmosphere is hydrogen / helium dominated .",
    "we discuss below the likely possibilities for the atmospheric make - up of gj 1214b that result from a combination of the @xcite , @xcite and our own data .",
    "our results disfavour a water - world composition , but such a composition is possible if our ks - band point is simply an outlier ; such a composition will remain a distinct possibility until further observations either confirm our increased ks - band depth or detect spectral features at other wavelengths .",
    "the observations to date are most qualitatively consistent with a hydrogen / helium dominated atmosphere that is either hazy or one with more complicated spectral features than our current models suggest , such as an atmosphere where non - equilibrium chemistry plays a significant role .",
    "we observed the transit of gj 1214b on four  occasions with wircam on cfht .",
    "for each transit we observed gj 1214 in two bands nearly simultaneously by rapidly switching the wircam filter wheel back and forth between the two filters .",
    "we observed gj 1214 alternating between the j ( @xmath01.25 @xmath1 ) and ks ( @xmath02.15 @xmath1 ) filters on the evenings of 2010 june 27 , 2010 august 15 and 2010",
    "september 22 . on the evening of 2010 august 7",
    "we observed gj 1214 alternating between the j and ch@xmath13on filters ( @xmath01.69 @xmath1 ) ; these 2010 august 7 observations were of a partial transit only , as the airmass of gj 1214 increased during transit and during egress reached an airmass of @xmath02.3 , close to the hard limit of the telescope , preventing further observations .",
    "for the 2010 june 27 transit the airmass was low for the duration of the observations , while for the 2010 august 15 and 2010 september 22 transits the airmass increased throughout the observations and exceeded an airmass of two by the end of the out - of - transit baseline .",
    "for these latter two observations we noticed that the data quality significantly degraded as the airmass rose above 2.0 ; for the analysis that follows we therefore exclude the data in the out - of - transit baseline with an airmass greater than two for the 2010 august 15 and 2010",
    "september 22 observations .",
    "we observed gj 1214 in staring mode @xcite where we use the full wircam array with its 21@xmath1421  field - of - view and do not dither for the duration of our observations .",
    "the only exception to our normal staring mode practice was the aforementioned filter change .",
    "the exposure times and defocus amounts for our various observations were : 3.5 @xmath15 and 2.0 @xmath16 for ks - band , 4 @xmath15 and 1.2 @xmath16 for the ch@xmath13on - filter , and 3.5 @xmath15 and 1.8 @xmath16 for j - band , respectively .",
    "the filter change during our observations induced an additional overhead of 20 seconds to switch the filter wheel , as well as an additional 60 seconds to take two acquisition images to fine - tune the target position and reinitiate guiding .",
    "we observed in data - cubes of 12 exposures to increase the observing efficiency .",
    "we took 12 exposures ( one guide - cube ) in a single filter , before performing the filter change and observing an additional 12 exposures in the other filter .",
    "the resulting duty cycles were : 22% for our j and ks - band observations , and 19% for our ch@xmath13on and j - band observations .",
    "the data were reduced and aperture photometry was performed on our target star and numerous reference stars .",
    "we used apertures with radii of 17 , 18 and 15 pixels for our ks , j and ch@xmath13on photometry , respectively ; the associated inner and outer radii for the sky annuli were 21 and 29 pixels for our ks - band and ch@xmath13on photometry , and 22 and 30 pixels for our j - band photometry .",
    "we preprocess our data using the iiwi pipeline , designed specifically for wircam imaging .",
    "we performed differential photometry on the target star with between 13 - 25 reference stars for our photometry in our various bands ; for further details on the method we refer the reader to @xcite . as can be seen in figure [ figpoisson ]",
    ", the out - of - transit photometry after subtraction of the background trend ( @xmath17[secresults ] ) bins down near the gaussian noise expectation with increasing bin size in all cases .",
    "our data is therefore not seriously affected by time - correlated red - noise .",
    "we set our errors for our transits equal to the root mean square of the data outside of transit after the subtraction of a linear trend ; for our j and ch@xmath13on photometry on 2010 august 7 we scale up the errors from the rms by a factor of @xmath18 as this data is of a partial transit only , and the egress of transit occurs at very high airmass , which we found to be correlated with degraded precision with our other data - sets .",
    "the resulting light curves for the various observations are displayed in the top panel of figure [ figtransits ] .",
    "we fit each of our data - sets with a @xcite transit model , with the depth of transit , ( @xmath19/@xmath20)@xmath21 , and the best - fit mid - transit time as free parameters . for several of our gj 1214 datasets we noticed obvious trends with time after our differential photometry was performed , similar to the trends noticed in several of our existing wircam datasets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we can not rule out that these trends are intrinsic to the target star and could be due to , for instance , long - term stellar variability as a result of rotational modulation .",
    "however , the frequency with which we observe such trends suggests that most of these trends are likely systematic in nature .",
    "we therefore refer to these trends as background trends , and we fit our datasets with linear or quadratic backgrounds of the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the time interval from the beginning of the observations and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are fit parameters . to determine whether a quadratic ( @xmath26 ) term is justified to account for the background trend , we calculate the bayesian information criterion ( bic ; @xcite ) , and ensure that the bic is lower with the inclusion of the quadratic term",
    ". that is , the reduction in @xmath27 must be sufficient to justify the extra degree of freedom .",
    "only the august 15 ks - band data warranted a quadratic term ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we employ markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) fitting as described in @xcite and @xcite using chains with 5@xmath1410@xmath28 steps .",
    "there are four free parameters for each data - set : ( @xmath19/@xmath20)@xmath21 , the best - fit mid - transit time , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we also fit our data with the `` residual - permutation '' method @xcite where the residuals to the best - fit data are shifted and refit , thus preserving the time correlation of any red - noise in the data , so as to investigate the impact of time correlated systematics .",
    "we find similar results to our mcmc analysis , although in general the errors are slightly larger .",
    "the increased size of the errors otherwise is likely due to low number statistics as in this method for @xmath29 data - points one can only generate 2@xmath29 - 1 light curve permutations ( @xmath0200 - 350 iterations for each of our data - sets ) . for these reasons",
    "we quote our mcmc results henceforth .",
    "we employ a quadratic limb - darkening law and obtain our limb - darkening parameters from @xcite for the j , ks and ch@xmath13on filters  we adopt their h - band limb - darkening parameters for our ch@xmath13on filter observations .",
    "the @xcite limb - darkening parameters are calculated through fits to the phoenix stellar atmosphere models @xcite .",
    "we employ the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 from non - linear limb darkening laws , as quoted in table [ tableresults ] . for the input values that we use to generate the limb - darkening parameters we use approximations to the measured stellar effective temperature ( @xmath32 = 3026 @xmath33 ) , and log of the stellar surface gravity ( log g = 4.991 [ cgs units ] , @xcite ) , of @xmath32 = 3000 @xmath33 and log g = 5.0 .",
    "we adopt the period and ephemeris of gj 1214b given in @xcite .",
    "we use the inclination and semi - major axis to stellar radius ratio and a semi - major axis to stellar radius ratio of a/@xmath34=14.97 . ] determined from an analysis from the @xcite white - light curves ( j. bean electronic communication ) .",
    "all other parameters were fixed at the @xcite values .",
    "our best - fit mcmc transit and background fits for each of our individual transit datasets are listed in the `` ind . ''",
    "rows of table [ tableresults ] and displayed in the appropriately coloured lines of figure [ figtransits ] .    as discussed below ( @xmath17[secdiscuss ] ) we note a small , but significant difference in the transit depths we measure in the j and ks - bands . to confirm that this difference is significant , and not due to any uncertainty in the limb - darkening coefficients",
    "we also fit our three j & ks - band transits simultaneously while fitting the two quadratic limb - darkening coefficients for each band ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) .",
    "we place a priori constraints on the limb - darkening coefficients ; these priors on the limb - darkening coefficients are gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.05 from the values derived from @xcite ( and listed in the `` ind .",
    "'' rows of table [ tableresults ] for the j and ks - bands ) . for each of our three transits",
    "we fit the ks and j - band data - sets with their own background terms ( e.g. @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for the 2010 june 27 transit ) .",
    "we fit for the three mid - transit times of our three transits ( to allow for possible transiting timing variations ) , but ensure that this value is held in common between the j and ks - band transits observed simultaneously .",
    "we fit for the j - band transit depths , but fit the ks - band transits with a depth that is a consistent factor [ @xmath5 ] greater , or less than , the j - band transit observed nearly simultaneously for all three transits . by utilizing this fitting method , in addition to the methods discussed below in @xmath17[secdiff ] , we can directly ascertain how much deeper the ks - band transits are than the j - band transits .",
    "the advantage of fitting for the depth of each of the j - band transits individually , rather than fitting them with a consistent depth , is that this allows for small variations in the j - band depth that could arise from rotational modulation ( as discussed in @xmath17[secspots ] ) , while still directly fitting for the ratio of the ks to j - band transit depths .",
    "we fit for 24 parameters overall , and the best - fit results are listed in the rows marked `` joint '' analysis in table [ tableresults ] .",
    "we also ensured that any difference in the transit depth from the j to ks - bands was not due to an ineffective non - linearity correction . during the iiwi preprocessing step ,",
    "a non - linearity correction is applied to correct the count levels for pixels that approach saturation . near saturation",
    "this non - linearity correction can be as large as 10% . at the maximum count levels recorded in a pixel of the aperture of our target star , gj 1214 , during our observations",
    ", the detector is well below its saturation level , and the wircam detector is approximately 3 - 5% non - linear at these count levels .",
    "the vast majority of the pixels in our target star and reference stars apertures are illuminated to much lower levels and are expected to be non - linear at the 1 - 3% level .",
    "if this non - linearity correction was applied ineffectively then this could cause a systematic offset in our measured transit depths ; although this discrepancy was expected to be much smaller than the difference in the transit depth from j to ks that we measure , we nonetheless demonstrated this was the case by reprocessing and reanalyzing our 2010 september 22 transit data in the j and ks - bands without applying the non - linearity correction . any deviations in the pixel count values from the current non - linearity correction , will be more than an order of magnitude smaller than the effect induced by not applying the non - linearity correction whatsoever .",
    "not employing the non - linearity corrections , as expected , leads to shallower transit depths than when the non - linearity correction is applied .",
    "however , the ratio of the transits depths from ks to j are near identical whether the non - linearity correction is , or is not , applied .",
    "overall , as this test should create a variation much larger than one due to an ineffective non - linearity correction , it is safe to conclude that the greater ks - band than j - band transit depth does not arise from the non - linearity correction .",

    "the ks - band transits also display similar depths to one another .",
    "however , the ks - band transits appear to be deeper than the j - band transits ; this is a small effect , but is clearly visible in the bottom panel of figure [ figtransits ] where we present the residuals of our observations from the best - fit j - band transit depths observed nearly simultaneously .",
    "the ch@xmath13on transit depth , on the other hand , appears to have a similar transit depth to the the j - band transit observed simultaneously on 2011 august 7 .",
    "as this is a partial transit only , and as much of the transit and the egress of transit occurs at very high airmass , caution is warranted in any robust comparison of the j to ch@xmath13on transit depth and to other wavelengths .    by combining all the ks - band and j - band transits , we find the weighted means and the associated errors on the transit depths are ( @xmath95/@xmath20)@xmath21=1.338@xmath30.013% for j - band , and ( @xmath96/@xmath20)@xmath21=1.438@xmath30.019% for ks - band .",

    "overall , this analysis suggests that our ks - band and j - band transit depths are inconsistent with one another ; the ks - band transit depth is deeper than the j - band depth with 5@xmath6 confidence .",
    "@xcite reported that gj 1214 is an active star and displays longer term variability with a period of several weeks at the 2% level in the mearth bandpass .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented and analyzed mearth photometry of gj 1214 from 2008 to 2010 and observed long - term photometric variability at the 1% level with a period of approximately 50 days .",
    "this variability is presumably due to rotational modulation from spots rotating in and out of view . as the long - term photometric monitoring presented in @xcite ends in 2010 july ( in the midst of the observations we present here ) we assume the more conservative limit of 2% variability for our calculations henceforth .",
    "transit observations obtained at different epochs may show small differences in the transit depth due to rotational modulation arising from both occulted and unocculted spots @xcite . in the case of unocculted spots ,",
    "if the 2% observed rotational modulation represents the full range from a spotted to unspotted photosphere then we may expect measurements of the transit depth of gj 1214b will vary by as much as 0.03% of the stellar signal in the mearth bandpass ( assuming an unspotted transit depth of 1.35% ) from observations taken at epochs spanning the maximum and the minimum of the observed rotational modulation . on the other hand , occulted spots will cause small brightening events during the transit that may lead one to underestimate the true transit depth .",
    "thus , for transit depth measurements obtained at different epochs , such as our own , it is possible that the variability caused by rotational modulation creates small differences in the measured depths for observations taken at different epochs .",
    "however , for our data obtained nearly simultaneously in two different bands , the effect of spots should be reduced for the following reasons .",
    "first of all , as the stellar rotation period of gj 1214 appears to be much longer @xcite than the @xmath01 hour duration of the transit , the spot pattern should be essentially static during a single transit .",
    "secondly , even if the star is very spotted during our own observations , the difference between the transit depths measured nearly simultaneously in our two bands will be minute . this small difference will arise due to the differing ratio of the planck function of the spot and the star due to their different temperatures ; however , this difference will be muted as we move into the near infrared .",
    "for instance , assuming that gj 1214 has spots 500 k cooler  a value supposedly consistent with another m4.5 dwarf @xcite  than gj 1214 s @xmath03000 k effective temperature @xcite , the 2.0% variability due to rotational modulation in the mearth bandpass ( @xmath0780 @xmath101 ) , will translate into 1.5% , and 1.0% variability in j - band and ks - band , respectively .",
    "assuming the unspotted transit depth is 1.350% in these bands then the maximum transit depths from unocculted spots , which would results from measurements at the minimum flux of the observed rotational modulation , would be 1.369% in j and 1.364% in ks - band .",
    "the variation in the transit depth between the j and ks - bands that we observe is both much larger than this predicted effect due to starspots , and also would serve to create a deeper transit in j - band , rather than ks - band ; we , of course , observe the opposite phenomenon .",
    "a deeper ks - band than j - band transit could arise from spots along the transit chord that are occulted during the observations .",
    "occultation of spots by a planet will create anomalous brightenings during transit , as has been observed for the transiting planets hd 189733b @xcite , tres-1b @xcite , and more recently for gj 1214b @xcite .",
    "however , due to the near - simultaneous nature of our photometry , it is unlikely that occulting spots could account for the variation in ks to j - band transit depth that we observe , again due to the small difference in the planck functions of the spot relative to the star between our two bands .",
    "for instance , occulting a spot 500 k cooler than the surrounding photosphere that is 30% of the planetary size , will lead to transits that are 0.07% shallower for the duration of the occultation than the presumed 1.35% transit depth in j - band .",
    "however the ks - band transit depth will also be 0.05% shallower ; the 0.02% relative difference between the two bands expected from a spot occultation is much less than the observed transit depth difference we observe .",
    "lastly , as spot occultations will lead to overall shallower transit depths , one would require the true transit depth of gj 1214b to be deeper than that observed in our own j - band observations and in the optical and very near - infrared @xcite .",
    "for these reasons we find it unlikely that the transit depth difference we observe arises from occulted or unocculted spots .",
    "due to the aforementioned possible variations in the transit depths from epoch to epoch induced by spots , a more straightforward method to compare the depths of transits in our bands is to directly compare the depth of the transit in one band to the depth obtained simultaneously in another - that is @xmath5 for each one of our transits observed simultaneously in the ks and j - bands .",
    "we ignore our data observed on 2010 august 7 for this analysis , as gj 1214 was observed in the j - band and the ch@xmath13on filter , rather than in j and ks .",

    "] by analyzing the individual transits , our ks - band photometry displays a deeper transit depth than our j - band photometry observed nearly simultaneously with a confidence in excess of 4@xmath6 .    in the second method we use the `` joint '' mcmc analysis described above where we simultaneously fit the three three data - sets that observe in ks - band and j - band simultaneously .",

    "the transit depths from our cfht / wircam photometry suggests that gj 1214b should have a large scale height , low mean molecular weight and thus a hydrogen / helium dominated atmosphere .",
    "these conclusions arise from the fact that our ks - band transit depths are deeper than our j - band transit depths by a factor of @xmath5=1.072@xmath30.018 .",
    "this corresponds to a relative change in the radius of gj 1214b from the ks - band to the j - band of 1.04% , or @xmath0610",
    "@xmath103 compared to gj 1214b s radius of @xmath017070 @xmath103 . using its equilibrium temperature of @xmath11@xmath0560 @xmath33 (",
    "the value obtained assuming zero bond albedo ) this amounts to absorption increasing the radius of gj 1214b by @xmath02 atmospheric scale heights for a hydrogen gas envelope ( h@xmath104 ) . as",
    ", the molecular weight of @xmath105 is approximately nine times greater than hydrogen gas , a spectral feature this prominent assuming a water world composition would require an increase in the planetary radius of @xmath020 atmospheric scale heights .",
    "this suggests that an atmosphere dominated by light elements is much more probable than one composed of heavier elements .",
    "the change in transit depth due to a change in planetary radius between the line , @xmath106 , and the continuum , @xmath107 , can be related to the scale height , @xmath108 , and the opacities in the absorption line , @xmath109 , and the continuum , @xmath110 ; this value can be approximated by the ratio of the opacities multiplied by the area of an annulus one scale height thick relative to that of the stellar disk : @xmath111 @xcite . to cause the observed transit depth difference in a hydrogen gas atmosphere would require line opacity marginally greater than that of the continuum ( @xmath112@xmath08 )",
    "; the water - world composition would require an opacity that is unrealistically larger than that of the continuum ( @xmath112@xmath02@xmath1410@xmath113 ) .",
    "therefore from our cfht / wircam observations , one would expect that the atmosphere of gj 1214b must have a low mean molecular weight , a large scale height , and thus an atmosphere dominated by hydrogen and/or helium .",
    "we compare our data to the @xcite atmospheric models of gj 1214b in figure [ figgj1214 ] .",
    "we first employ the most conservative scenario and assume that due to rotational modulation , or other systematic errors , that we can not directly compare our measured transit depths to the @xcite or @xcite depths .",
    "we thus scale - up or down the predicted absorption of the @xcite models by a multiplicative factor , analogous to an increase or decrease of the squared ratio of the planetary to stellar radius , to produce the best - fit ( minimum @xmath99 ) compared to our observations .",
    "we display the @xcite water - world model ( an @xmath105 dominated world ) in the dotted grey line .",
    "we compare to two hydrogen - helium dominated atmospheres ; the first has solar - metallicity ( orange dot - dash line ) while the second has solar metallicity but does not feature methane ( cyan dot - dashed line ) .",
    "we integrate these models over the wircam response functions and calculate the associated @xmath99 of our data compared to the model .",
    "although , we can not strongly differentiate between hydrogen - helium envelopes with solar metallicity ( @xmath114=9 ) from those without methane ( @xmath115=7 ) , the water - world composition is disfavoured ( @xmath116=26 ) by greater than 2@xmath6 for our seven degrees of freedom .",
    "other high mean molecular weight models ( e.g. the @xcite co@xmath104-dominated or h@xmath104o / co@xmath104-mixture atmospheres ) are disfavoured with similar confidence .",
    "the support for the hydrogen / helium composition arises from the observed increased absorption in ks - band as opposed to our j - band observations .",
    "the ch@xmath13on filter is nominally 1@xmath6 discrepant from the observed models ; it is unclear at this present time whether this discrepancy is physical or simply due to low signal - to - noise .",
    "arguably , completely excluding the constraints imposed by transit depth observations at other wavelengths , because of the effects of spots or systematic effects , is unnecessarily conservative .",
    "therefore , we also compare the weighted means of our transit depth measurements and the @xcite models to the @xcite depth measurement in the mearth bandpass , the j - band measurement of @xcite , and the @xcite measurements from 0.78 - 1.0 @xmath1 in figure [ figall ] . we do not attempt to make a correction for the possibly variable spot activity between the various epochs at which the data were obtained ; as discussed above in @xmath17[secspots ]",
    "rotational modulation can be expected to induce spurious transit depth variations as large as 0.03% of the @xmath01.35% transit depth of gj 1214b near 1 @xmath1 , and will cause smaller variations at longer wavelengths . also , a small discrepancy will be induced by the fact that @xcite and @xcite transit depth measurements were produced with the original @xcite estimates of the inclination and other parameters for this system , rather than the values derived from the @xcite white light photometry that we use here and that have been applied to the @xcite spectrophotometry .",
    "for these reasons we caution that this comparison should be considered illustrative , rather than definitive .",
    "of the original @xcite atmospheric models the heavy mean molecular weight models , such as the water - world composition model ( @xmath116=40 ) , are highly favoured over the low mean molecular weight compositions ( @xmath114=101   for the solar metallicity hydrogen / helium dominated envelope).[secmodels ] , we scale the radii of the planet in the models up or down to achieve the minimum @xmath27 compared to the data . ]",
    "the water - world composition is favoured over the solar metallicity hydrogen / helium dominated model with more than 5@xmath6 confidence .",
    "this is unsurprising , as it is largely the conclusion of the @xcite paper , and results from the high precision of the vlt / fors2 spectrophotometry and the lack of observed spectral features in the very near - infrared .",
    "the @xcite paper excludes the expected methane and water spectral absorption features from a hydrogen / helium dominated atmosphere from 0.78 - 1.0 @xmath1 with high confidence .",
    "another possibility to explain the lack of observed spectral features are high altitude hazes @xcite in the atmosphere of gj 1214b that could mute the spectral features at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we discuss this possibility further below ( @xmath17[sechazes ] ) .",
    "we thus also compare our observations to a no methane model where we cut off the absorption below 1 @xmath1 and set it equal to a nominal value of 1.35% . at wavelengths greater than 1 @xmath1 , the values are identical to the no methane model .",
    "this abrupt transition is not intended to be physical , but simply illustrative of the impact hazes could have on the expected transmission spectrum at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this model has the lowest @xmath99 ( @xmath117=34 ) of any of the models as it is able to address the lack of observed spectral features in the @xcite spectrophotometry , and our deeper ks - band depth compared to our j - band depth channel observations of the transit of gj 1214b .",
    "they find similar transit depths in these bands to those found by @xcite and @xcite in the very near - infrared .",
    "if methane is present in the atmosphere of gj 1214b it should cause increased absorption in the 3.6 @xmath1 channel ; as this is not observed , if the atmosphere of gj 1214b is hydrogen / helium dominated , the combination of all the observations to date argues in favour of the hazy hydrogen / helium dominated model without methane . ] .",
    "we note that the improvement in the @xmath99 of this haze model to the water - world model is not significant , and both remain leading candidates to explain all the observations of gj 1214 to date , as discussed below .",
    "all the transmission spectroscopy observations of gj 1214b to date could be explained by a high mean molecular weight atmosphere if our deeper ks - band transit is simply an outlier . if gj 1214b s atmosphere does have a high mean molecular weight ,",
    "a water vapour atmosphere is a leading possibility .",
    "this water - world scenario will remain a viable candidate until observations are performed to either confirm that our ks - band transit depths are indeed deeper , or spectral features are detected at other wavelengths .    a scenario that would qualitatively explain all the observations to date , is a hydrogen / helium dominated atmosphere with thick hazes that would mute the presence of spectral features arising from shorter wavelengths due to scattering .",
    "this haze layer would have to be at high altitudes , and low pressures ( @xmath118200 mbar ) , to effectively mute the expected spectral features that would arise from being able to stare deep into the atmosphere of the planet in opacity windows in the very near - infrared .",
    "the efficiency of scattering diminishes for wavelengths longer than the approximate particle size @xcite .",
    "the haze particles could not be much smaller than sub - micron size to account for the the lack of observed spectral features in the @xcite spectrophotometry in the very near - infrared . due to the expected size of these putative haze particles , shorter wavelength optical observations",
    "would not be expected to show simply the monotonic increase in planetary radius expected from a rayleigh scattering signal , but instead the more complicated transmission spectrum signal of mie scattering ( see for example @xcite ) .    such a haze or cloud layer",
    "is certainly not inconceivable .",
    "a cloud deck or haze has been reported to mute the optical transmission spectrum from 0.29 - 1.05 @xmath1 of the hot jupiter hd 189733b @xcite ; in the infrared hd 189733b may have absorption features with an opacity even greater than those that result from the haze at those wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the hazes of jupiter and titan may be other suitable analogies .",
    "titan has a haze layer that is optically thick in the optical , but has transparent windows as one moves into the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "the opacity of hazes on jupiter are high at short optical wavelengths , but are much smaller as one moves into longer optical wavelengths and into the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "a potential culprit for the particle causing this haze is a hydrocarbon derived from the photochemical destruction of methane @xcite .",
    "methane is found in the atmospheres of all the solar system s giant planets , as well as titan .",
    "the end product of the breakdown of methane are higher order hydrocarbons that condense as solids @xcite .",
    "since gj1214b should be relatively cool ( @xmath11@xmath0500k ) its atmospheric carbon inventory could feature abundant methane , like jupiter .",
    "particulates with a relatively small mixing ratio can have important effects at the slant viewing geometry appropriate for transits @xcite , and thus hydrocarbons in a high altitude haze are one possible explanation the lack of observed features in the @xcite spectrophotometry .    we lastly note , that the actual spectral features of gj 1214b , whether its atmosphere is hydrogen / helium dominated or not , could be more complicated and thus very different than the @xcite models predict .",
    "one such reason could be the impact of non - equilibrium chemistry , which will be explored in a forthcoming publication ( miller - ricci kempton et al . in prep . ) .",
    "clearly further observations are required to differentiate between these scenarios and determine the true atmospheric makeup of gj 1214b .",
    "the increased transit depths we note in our ks - band observations , argue for an opacity source near @xmath02.15 microns that is causing increased absorption along the limb of the planet .",
    "one such , possible opacity source is methane , which is predicted to cause absorption from @xmath02.2 to @xmath02.4 @xmath1 in the @xcite hydrogen - helium dominated atmospheric models . although our ks - band transit depth is qualitatively consistent with this methane spectral absorption feature , we note that the @xcite hydrogen / helium model with solar metallicity but without methane , provides a near - identical goodness - of - fit as compared to the solar metallicity model with methane .",
    "this is because the methane absorption feature is present at the red - edge of our ks - band only ; on the blue edge of the ks - band the hydrogen / helium model with methane actually features less absorption than the model without methane , so overall the predicted transit depth is similar whether methane is or is not present according to the @xcite prediction .",
    "also , greater concentrations of methane in the atmosphere are not expected to cause increased absorption at these wavelengths . in the no methane model ,",
    "the increased ks - band absorption compared to j - band results from water opacity .",
    "thus both water and methane remain viable candidates for this increased absorption .",
    "both these molecules should also lead to spectral features from 0.78 - 1.0 @xmath1 that have been ruled out by the @xcite spectrophotometry at high confidence .",
    "thus for these chemicals to remain viable opacity sources , one requires the presence of hazes in the atmosphere of gj 1214b , or that the spectral features are more complicated than the @xcite models predict .",
    "we encourage further modelling to elucidate whether this @xmath02.15 @xmath1 feature is due to methane , water or another opacity source .      a hydrogen / helium dominated atmosphere on gj 1214b would be expected to undergo significant hydrodynamic escape .",
    "therefore , if gj 1214b is hydrogen / helium dominated then it may have lost or is losing a significant fraction of its gaseous envelope . @xcite and @xcite predicted that if gj 1214b s atmosphere is dominated by hydrogen gas then it will lose on the order of @xmath010@xmath119 @xmath120@xmath121 , or @xmath00.02 @xmath7 on a 4 gyr timescale . as its host star may have been more active earlier in its life , and thus brighter in the ultraviolet , its cumulative mass loss may be higher .",
    "thus , either if gj 1214b s hydrogen / helium envelope is primordial or due to outgassing we may expect it to have lost and will be losing a non - negligible fraction of its atmosphere .",
    "also , @xcite have pointed out that the radius of the star , gj 1214 , that one obtains from stellar evolutionary models is very different than the radius one obtains from an analysis of the light curve . as a result",
    "the density of gj 1214b varies accordingly , from one where a significant gaseous atmosphere is likely , to a much higher density where one would only expect a thin gaseous atmosphere on top of a solid terrestrial planet .",
    "our increased ks - band transit depth argues in favour of the lighter density and the stellar radius suggested by fits to light curve parameters .",
    "if the atmosphere of gj 1214b is hydrogen / helium dominated then this allows us to place a constraint on the planet s bulk composition , namely its core , mantle and possibly its ice layer @xcite .",
    "this is because the lighter atmospheric composition of a hydrogen / helium atmosphere , compared to for instance a water - world composition , requires a heavier interior composition of silicates , ferrous material or ices to compensate in order to fit the observed mass and radius  and thus density  constraints of @xcite .",
    "we compare our results to two numerical models @xcite that attempt to determine the range of realistic bulk compositions that agree with the observed mass and radius constraints . regardless of whether the planet s hydrogen / helium envelope is primordial or due to outgassing , it is expected that this atmospheric layer will be a small percentage ( @xmath05% ) of this planet s total mass @xcite . @xcite and @xcite predict , under their hydrogen / helium atmosphere scenarios , that a wide range of core / mantle masses is still viable ( from a few percent to @xmath099% of the mass of gj 1214b ) .",
    "the higher core / mantle masses result from a planet with very little water , while for the lower masses it would entail a massive interior water / ice layer .",
    "@xcite suggest that if this planet s atmosphere is dominated by hydrogen and helium then one can place an upper limit on the water to rock ratio of approximately six - to - one ; the true value of this quantity is expected to be much lower , and thus the core mass is expected to make - up at least @xmath014% of the planet s mass and likely much more @xcite .",
    "we report observations of four transits of gj 1214b using wircam on cfht .",
    "we observed nearly simultaneously in j - band and in ks - band for three of the transits , and in j - band and the ch@xmath13on filter in another .",
    "our best - fit j - band transit depth is consistent with the values obtained in the optical and very near - infrared : @xmath2=1.338@xmath30.013% .",
    "our ks - band transit is deeper : @xmath4=1.438@xmath30.019% .",
    "our j and ks - band transit depths are inconsistent at the 5@xmath6 level .",
    "the impact of spots and rotational modulation on the transit depths we observe should be small ; nevertheless spots will induce small changes in the transit depths we measure from epoch to epoch , and as a result a better metric to quantify our observations may be the factor that the ks - band transits are deeper than the j - band transits observed simultaneously .",
    "our ks - band transits display a deeper depth than our j - band transits by a factor of @xmath5=1.072@xmath30.018 .",
    "we thus detect increased transit depths in our broadband ks - band ( @xmath02.15 @xmath12 m ) as compared to j - band ( @xmath01.25 @xmath12 m ) with 4@xmath6 confidence .",
    "the difference in transit depth between the two bands that we measure is best explained due to a spectral absorption feature from the atmosphere of gj 1214b ; the only way to get a spectral absorption feature this prominent is if the atmosphere of gj 1214b has a large scale height , low mean molecular weight and is thus hydrogen / helium dominated .",
    "water or methane are possible opacity sources to explain this absorption . if gj 1214b s atmosphere is hydrogen / helium dominated a range of core / mantle masses and ice layers is still viable , but the planet must have a large rocky core / mantle interior to its gaseous envelope . in this case",
    ", our increased ks - band transit depth would be the first detection of a spectral feature in a super - earth atmosphere , and gj 1214b would best be described as a mini - neptune .",
    "however , when combining our observations with other observations of gj 1214b , most specifically the lack of spectral features observed in the @xcite vlt / fors2 spectrophotometry from 0.78 - 1.0 @xmath1 , the atmospheric composition of gj 1214b is less clear .",
    "there are several leading possibilities .",
    "one possibility remains that the atmosphere of gj 1214b is water - vapour dominated and our increased ks - band transit depth is simply an outlier ; our increased ks - band transit depth will have to be reconfirmed or spectral features at other wavelengths will have to be detected before this scenario can be confidently ruled out .",
    "the possibility that is arguably the most consistent with all the observed data to date , is that gj 1214b has a hydrogen / helium dominated atmosphere with a haze layer at high altitude consisting of particles that can be no smaller than approximately sub - micron in size ; such a scenario would explain the lack of observed spectral absorption features in the very near - infrared in the @xcite spectrophotometry and our own increased ks - band transit depth if there is an opacity source at @xmath02.15 @xmath1 .",
    "lastly , we note that the true spectrum of gj 1214b could be more complicated than our models predict for a variety of reasons - one such possibility is the importance of non - equilibrium chemistry in gj 1214b s atmosphere which would alter gj 1214b s predicted transmission spectrum ( miller - ricci kempton et al . in prep . ) .    clearly , further observations are required to precisely determine the nature of gj 1214b s atmosphere .",
    "we encourage further observations to confirm our increased ks - band transit depth .",
    "we plan to use cfht / wircam to reobserve the transit of gj 1214b in ks - band on several occasions in the spring / summer 2011 observing season .    the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada supports the research of b.c . and r.j .",
    "e.m-r.k.s work was performed under contract with the california institute of technology funded by nasa through the sagan fellowship program .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee and the great many other people who commented on and improved this manuscript prior to publication .",
    "the authors especially appreciate the hard - work and diligence of the cfht staff for both scheduling these challenging observations and ensuring these `` staring mode '' observations were successful ."
