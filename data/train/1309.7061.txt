    "studies of red super - giants ( rsgs ) has been hampered by their small numbers , in spite of their importance to investigations of stellar evolution at stages immediately preceding supernova explosions .",
    "the star cluster rsgc  1 is one of the rare clusters in the galaxy containing a significant number ( @xmath1 ) of rsgs @xcite .",
    "rsgc  1 is fairly young , and very massive ; with an initial mass estimated to be @xmath2@xmath3 , and an age of @xmath4  myr @xcite .    it has been shown rsgc  1 may host high - energy objects ; the hess telescope array found the diffuse , @xmath5  pc gamma - ray source , hess  j1837069 nearby to rsgc  1 @xcite , implying cosmic - rays ( crs ) are accelerated around the cluster .",
    "cr acceleration in massive young clusters is thought to arise through one of two processes : the crs are accelerated by pulsars in the clusters ; or the crs are accelerated by shock waves formed by collisions of stellar winds or by supernova explosions in the clusters . in the former ,",
    "electrons are mainly accelerated , while in the latter both electrons and protons can be accelerated . in the case of rsgc  1 , the former model has often been supported .",
    "in fact , integral found a hard x - ray source ax  j1838.00655 @xcite , approximately co - located with rsgc  1 , where later observations using the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) @xcite led to the discovery of 70.5  ms pulsations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar psr j18380655 is a rotation - powered pulsar with spin - down luminosity @xmath6 and characteristic age @xmath7  yr : the properties of the pulsar and the pulsar wind nebular ( pwn ) have also been theoretically studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen column density toward the pulsar is almost the same as those for stars in rsgc  1 , which may imply that the pulsar is associated with the cluster @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the pulsar supports the scenario where the observed gamma - rays are formed by inverse compton scattering of the cr electrons in the pwn ( leptonic process ; @xcite ) .",
    "rsgc  1 is not the only young massive cluster in the galaxy that radiates gamma - rays : other canonical examples being westerlund  1 ( wd  1 ) and  2 ( wd  2 ) .",
    "gamma - rays are observed from a wide ( @xmath8  pc ) region around wd  1 @xcite , although the source of the crs that emit the gamma - rays has not been identified .",
    "in contrast to rsgc  1 , the extremely large spatial scale would prevent cr electrons prevailing in the gamma - ray emission region before they are affected by cooling @xcite .",
    "thus , in the case of wd  1 , cr protons may be responsible for generating the observed gamma - rays , through their interaction with gas protons and the pion - decay process ( hadronic process ) , and in fact , wd  1 has sufficient gas mass to enable this process @xcite . in the case of wd  2 ,",
    "the spatial size of the gamma - ray emission region is @xmath931  pc ( depending on the radial distance ; @xcite ) .",
    "since pulsars have been detected in the gamma - ray emission region @xcite , pwne are likely responsible for generating the observed gamma - rays . however , as cr protons can certainly be accelerated in stellar winds or at the shock waves of supernova remnants ( snrs ) , gamma - ray formation through the hadronic process can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "nearby the young cluster ; the arches cluster , at the galactic center , is another gamma - ray source , 3eg j17462851 , which may radiate via inverse compton scattering of the radiation field of the cluster @xcite .",
    "however , since the galactic center is well populated with a wide variety of putative such objects , and is somewhat dynamic and confused , it may be premature to conclude definitively that this is the precise mechanism operating in this case @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of our observations of molecular material towards rsgc  1 , traced by @xmath10co(1 - 0 ) at 115.271 ghz .",
    "this study is motivated by the discovery of the pulsar near the cluster , which implies the gamma - rays need not necessarily have a leptonic origin : the existence of the pulsar is significant in suggesting that cr protons could have been accelerated at the snr associated with the pulsar .",
    "if sufficient gas exists around the cluster , the protons contained in the gas may collide with the cr protons , generating and radiating gamma - rays .",
    "the study of the gas distribution around the cluster may also give us clues regarding the evolution of massive clusters , bearing in mind the age of rsgc  1 is 1014  myr @xcite , and those of wd  1 and 2 are @xmath11  myr and @xmath12  myr , respectively @xcite and that difference of the ages necessarily implies the gas distribution around those clusters will be at different evolutionary stages , and therefore , will be dispersed differently .    cr acceleration in massive young clusters is also important in the context of high - energy cr protons and their role in the so - called knee in the the cr energy spectrum ( @xmath13  ev ) .",
    "usually thought to be accelerated in the shock waves of isolated snrs , the observed energy of crs around such snrs is generally much smaller than @xmath14  ev @xcite . in a massive cluster",
    "however , overlapping snrs would develop into super - bubbles with shocks whose larger size and longer lifetime may accelerate crs up to the knee , and thereby generating tev gamma - ray emissions @xcite . if this is the case , and if the gas density around the cluster is high , strong and wide - spread gamma - rays of hadronic origin would be observed from the cluster .    the radial velocity of rsgc  1 is well constrained thorough the observations of stars in the cluster . in this study , we assume that the radial velocity is @xmath15 and the distance to the cluster is @xmath16  kpc @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath17 corresponds to 1.9  pc .",
    "the position of the field center corresponds to the cluster center at r.a.= , decl.= ( j2000.0 ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "observations of the @xmath00 transition of @xmath10co were made with mopra 22  m single - dish radio telescope in australia , in september 2012 .",
    "the half - power beam width of the telescope was @xmath18 ( at the @xmath10co(1 - 0 ) transition frequency of 115  ghz ) , sampled with a spectrometer over 4096 channels .",
    "the resulting velocity resolution is @xmath19 ; pixel size is @xmath20 and the rms noise per channel is @xmath21  k ( efficiency not corrected ) .",
    "we compute the main - beam temperatures using an efficiency of 0.55 , as recommended for extended structures by @xcite .",
    "this efficiency value was confirmed to be consistent by our concurrent observations of m17sw , which yielded peak antenna temperatures of 25@xmath22 k , and is generally consistent with archived sest results where the _ extended _ beam efficiency is assumed to be 20% higher than the cited _ compact _ ( as it is for mopra ) of 0.45 .",
    "the data were reduced using the australia telescope national facility analysis programs , livedata and gridzilla , and they were analyzed using aips software package .",
    "an integrated intensity map of the observed @xmath23 region centered on rsgc  1 is shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "these data are integrated across the velocity range corresponding to the that of rsgc  1 ; @xmath24 .",
    "the gamma - ray emission region appears to cover a large portion of the field @xcite , and the x - ray source ax  j1838.00655 is shown , located to the southeast of rsgc  1 .",
    "significantly , we do not find any obvious unusually high column densities of co at this velocity range corresponding to rsgc  1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pv]a shows co ( @xmath00 ) velocity - latitude diagram integrated over a ra offset range of @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( see figure  [ fig : image ] ) , where the velocity channels are binned over 20 channels .",
    "this ra range contains the gamma - ray radiating region ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "while the gas is deficient for @xmath27 , it is abundant for @xmath28 .",
    "the gas rich region at @xmath28 apparently corresponds to the crux - scutum arm that is located at @xmath29 ( see also figure  [ fig : pv_f ] ) .",
    "rsgc  1 has a velocity slightly higher than the crux - scutum arm .",
    "there seems to be no structure associated with the gamma - ray radiating region ( from @xmath25 to 0 in the dec offset ; see figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pv]b is the same as figure  [ fig : pv]a but it is integrated over a ra offset range of @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( see figure  [ fig : image ] ) in order to study the region including rsgc  1 and ax  j1838.00655 .",
    "we assume in the figure that the velocity of ax  j1838.00655 is the same as that of rsgc  1 .",
    "co emission around rsgc  1 and ax  j1838.00655 is rather small .",
    "if we adopt a conversion factor of @xmath32 @xcite , the column density in the region for @xmath24 is @xmath33 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the lack of the emission is physically associated with rsgc  1 and ax  j1838.00655 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig1.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)fig2a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)fig2b.eps    ( 160mm,160mm)fig3.eps",
    "figure  [ fig : pv ] does not reveal any notable nor peculiar structure in the distribution of the molecular component around the velocity of rsgc  1 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we may constrain the mass of molecular gas associated with rsgc  1 by estimating the mass in a velocity range of @xmath24 .",
    "we chose this velocity range because the range is not much affected by the crux - scutum arm . note that since rsgc  1 is located on the peak of the galactic rotation curve in that direction ( figure  4 in @xcite ) , molecular gas with @xmath35 does not rotate with the galactic disk .",
    "for the conversion factor of @xmath36 @xcite , the molecular hydrogen mass in the entire @xmath23 field for the velocity range is @xmath37 .",
    "the mass of the gas that is gravitationally associated with the cluster could be even smaller , because the apparent size of the cluster is smaller than the @xmath38 field ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "we also derive the gas mass in the gamma - ray radiating field inside the dotted line in figure  [ fig : image ] for @xmath39 .",
    "we found that it is only @xmath40 .",
    "the rarity of the gas around rsgc  1 is notable after comparison of the gas mass with other young massive star clusters such as wd  1 and 2 .",
    "@xcite estimated that the hydrogen molecular density within a radius of @xmath41 from wd  1 is @xmath42 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if the hydrogen is spherically distributed , the total mass would be @xmath43 . in the case of wd  2 ,",
    "two molecular clouds are associated with the cluster and their total mass is @xmath44 @xcite . here",
    "we can note the difference of the gas mass may be due to that of cluster ages ; evolved massive stars and/or supernovae in rsgc  1 may have injected sufficient energy to disperse or even photo - disassociate the molecular gas during the cluster lifetime .",
    "we examine the foreground ( i.e. lower velocity regime ) of rsgc  1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pv_f ] shows that molecular material is concentrated at @xmath45 and  @xmath46 . in the direction of rsgc  1 ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , these concentrations are the carina - sagittarius arm and the crux - scutum arm , respectively ( figure  3 in @xcite ) . in the direction of the gamma - ray radiating region ( from @xmath25 to 0 in the dec offset ; see figure  [ fig : image ] ) , we find no obvious structures that may indicate the existence of snrs around the velocities of the arms where snrs are often found .",
    "thus , we consider it unlikely that the gamma - rays observed in the direction of rsgc  1 are emitted by foreground snrs .",
    "if the gamma - rays observed around rsgc  1 have a hadronic origin , they should be created through interactions between cr protons and the protons in the gas around the cluster .",
    "however , the deficiency of the gas around the cluster strongly suggests that there is a lack of the target protons for the interactions , without which the observed gamma - ray emission would require extremely large flux of cr protons to produce a given gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "based on the model by @xcite , we estimate the total energy of the cr protons required to produce the observed gamma - ray luminosity for the measured molecular gas - mass ( @xmath49 ) as @xmath50  erg .",
    "this energy is unreasonably large , and corresponds to the energy of crs accelerated by @xmath51 supernovae ( assuming an acceleration efficiency of @xmath5210% ) .",
    "even if @xmath51 supernovae have exploded , crs contained in older snrs must have been expelled by newer snrs .",
    "that is , if the total gas and cr energy of @xmath53  erg is confined in the gamma - ray emitting volume ( @xmath54 ) , the pressure there should be @xmath55 .",
    "this is much larger than the typical pressure in the galactic disk ( @xmath56 ) , and the gas and crs in that volume can not be physically be confined .",
    "therefore , we can confidently reject the hadronic scenario for gamma - ray production towards rsgc  1 , in contrast with wd  1 and  2 .",
    "although our field does not include the whole gamma - ray radiating region ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) , it contains most of it , and thus the conclusion is solid .",
    "a lack of spatial correlation between the gamma - ray radiating field and the co emission at the right - bottom corner in figure  [ fig : image ] also supports the conclusion .",
    "the recent discovery of the pulsar psr  j1838 - 0655 at the position of ax  j1838.00655 suggests that the pwn associated with it is the gamma - ray source @xcite , and further supports our findings here .",
    "we observed the distribution of @xmath10co ( @xmath00 ) emission towards and around the massive young star cluster rsgc  1 with mopra 22  m radio telescope .",
    "the cluster is located just outside the crux - scutum arm and we find the gas mass around the cluster is much smaller than those of other massive young clusters in the galaxy , such as wd  1 and  2 .",
    "the gas distribution of the foreground region is rather smooth and there seem to be no evidence of active activities that might imply additional energetic processes .",
    "the low gas mass around the cluster indicates that the gamma - ray emission around the cluster ( hess  j1837069 ) is insufficient for providing enough mass to support the hadronic scenario for gamma - ray production , and we suggest the cr emission appears to be coming from the pulsar found near the cluster .",
