    "[ ] @xmath14 [ ] @xmath797 [ ] @xmath568 [ ] ( a ) [ ] ( b ) [ ] @xmath1016 [ ] @xmath1017 [ ] @xmath94 [ ] @xmath95   0.5 truecm    figure 10    the face @xmath1017 is an _ s - face _ ( symmetric face ) as the definition in section 2.5.2 of @xcite . by remark 3.3 of @xcite , the minimal point of @xmath33 on @xmath1017",

    "these two points correspond to @xmath1022 and @xmath1023 in @xmath46 .",
    "by @xcite , the fibered cone @xmath22 of magic manifold @xmath44 containing @xmath1022 and @xmath1023 on the boundary has teichmuller polynomial @xmath1024 , here @xmath1008 is a basis of @xmath1025 dual with @xmath1005,[f_{\\beta}],[f_{\\gamma}])$ ] .",

    "but the numerical data implies it is impossible , so @xmath1034 .    in section 2.5.2 of @xcite , they pointed out that all the a - faces of @xmath1035 are _ entropy equivalent_. so for @xmath1010 , one pair of fibered faces have @xmath99 , while two other pairs have @xmath100 and these two pairs share the same invariant .",
    "so our invariant @xmath52 is not well defined for the whole manifold , but only for each fibered cone .    in lemma 3.5 of @xcite , they have shown that all the fibered faces of @xmath1036 have rational minimal point .",

    "although @xmath75 seems to be a general phenomenon , it is still quite mysterious what does this inequality mean . all the proof in this paper",
    "either does not give explicit example , or requires numerical computation to deduce irrationality .",
    "these two process both do not help the author much to understand the meaning of irrationality . a more sophisticated method to determine whether @xmath61 will help us to understand the question much deeper .",
    "for all the examples we give in this paper , the rationality of minimal point comes from symmetry , i.e. the rational minimal point @xmath37 is the unique fixed point of an nice group action on the fibered face @xmath21 .",
    "so another question is : whether rational @xmath37 implies any kind of symmetry ?",
    "theorem [ general ] tells us , for all closed or one punctured surfaces with @xmath74 , there exist pseudo - anosov @xmath0 on @xmath1 with @xmath68 . by the evident of drilling theorem ( theorem [ drill ] ) and our numerical experiments , it is natural to guess that the same result hold for all surfaces with @xmath74 .",
    "however , even if one single example of @xmath68 gives us a family of such examples , we still do not have enough examples to show that @xmath4 can be irrational for all surfaces with @xmath74 .",
    "the drilling theorem ( branched covering theorem ) tells us drilling ( branched covering ) deduce irrationality for all but finitely many drilling ( branched covering ) classes .",
    "however , from the proof of the theorem , the number of `` exceptional '' drilling class is very large and depend on the teichmuller polynomial numerically .",
    "the author would like to know , whether there is any better bound which only depend on the surface @xmath1 and dilatation @xmath357 , or even whether there is a universal bound .",
    "in all the examples in this paper , the @xmath2-rank of @xmath4 is either one or two .",
    "the author does not have an example with higher rank @xmath4 yet .",
    "furthermore , whether @xmath4 can be arbitrarily large ? the author tends to believe that one can do drilling construction to surface bundle with large @xmath566 to get large rank @xmath4 .",
    "the rank of @xmath4 also provides a simple invariant up to fibered cone commensurability , e.g. if @xmath4 has large rank , then @xmath5 is not fibered cone commensurable with @xmath246 if euler characteristic of @xmath166 is small .    \\5 . since virtually fibered conjecture holds ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , every hyperbolic @xmath8-manifold with finite volume has a finite cover which is a surface bundle over circle .",
    "so for any commensurable class @xmath1038 , the invariant @xmath52 is defined for a fibered cone @xmath22 of some @xmath1039 . then for any commensurability class @xmath1038 of hyperbolic @xmath8-manifold",
    ", we can ask many questions . for example , for any commensurability class @xmath1038 , whether there is a surface bundle over circle @xmath1040 , which has a fibered face @xmath22 , with @xmath99 ? for every commensurability class @xmath1038 , we can also define a @xmath2-submodule of @xmath3 , which is defined by @xmath1041 , here @xmath22 runs over all the fibered cones of all the manifolds in the commensurability class @xmath1038 . since hyperbolic @xmath8-manifolds have virtually rfrs ( residually finite rational solvable ) fundamental group ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , @xmath1038 has virtually infinite first betti number .",
    "moreover , for a fixed manifold @xmath44 , we can always find a finite cover , which has a fibered cone does not correspond to any fibered cone of @xmath44 .",
    "so @xmath1041 is a sum of infinitely terms .",
    "then it is natural to ask , whether @xmath1042 for any commensurability class @xmath1038 ?",
