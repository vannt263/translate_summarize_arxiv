    "solving difficult classical combinatorial problems by adiabatically controlling a fictitious quantum hamiltonian is a fascinating route to quantum computation @xcite , which is alternative to the main - stream approach @xcite .",
    "the quantum annealing ( qa ) strategy @xcite is precisely based on the adiabatic switching off , as a function of time , of strong fictitious quantum fluctuations , suitably introduced by an extra kinetic term in the otherwise classical hamiltonian under consideration .    a number of authors have by now applied qa to attack a variety of optimization problems .",
    "some amount of success was obtained in several cases , notably in the folding of off - lattice polymer models @xcite , in the 2d random ising model annealing@xcite , in the lennard - jones clusters optimization@xcite , and in the traveling salesman problem @xcite .    despite these successes  mostly obtained by path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) implementations of qa ",
    "there is no general theory addressing and even less predicting the performance of a qa algorithm .",
    "different optimization problems are characterized by different `` energy landscapes '' of barriers and valleys about which little is known but which clearly influence the annealing process@xcite .",
    "success of qa crucially depends on the efficiency with which the chosen kinetic energy and associated fictitious quantum fluctuations explores and influences these effective energy landscape .",
    "this is a uncomfortable situation , in view of the fact that it is _ a priori _ not obvious or guaranteed that a qa approach should do any better than , for instance , classical simulated annealing ( ca ) . indeed , for the interesting case of boolean satisfiability problems @xcite  more precisely , a prototypical np - complete problem such as 3-sat",
    " a recent study has shown that pimc - qa performs definitely _ worse _ than simple ca @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite , henceforth referred to as i , we compared classical and quantum annealing approaches in their performance to optimize the simplest potential landscape @xmath0 , namely the one - dimensional potential double - well .",
    "classical annealing was implemented by means of a fokker - planck ( fp ) equation with a time - dependent ( decreasing ) temperature @xmath1 .",
    "quantum annealing was performed through the schrdinger s equation , both in real and in imaginary time , describing a particle with a time - dependent ( decreasing ) inverse mass @xmath2 in the double - well potential @xmath0 .",
    "given the textbook simplicity of the problem , it was possible to correlate in detail the features of the landscape ( position and shape of valleys , barrier height ) with the outcome of the annealing process .",
    "one saw for instance that fokker - plank ca is sensitive only to the ratio @xmath3 of the energy splitting @xmath4 between the two wells , or valleys , and the barrier height @xmath5 , whereas on the contrary schrdinger qa is sensitive to the landau - zener tunneling gap , and hence , among other things , to the barrier width .",
    "unfortunately , such a direct approach is applicable , for practical purposes , only to insignificantly small sized optimization problems . to appreciate the difficulty , it is enough to consider that the number of possible configurations , and hence the hilbert space size , of a small 32@xmath632 square lattice ising model is @xmath7 , an astronomically large number which forbids any direct approach based on deterministic state evolution .",
    "hard instances of typical optimization problems involve an even larger number of variables . because of that , alternative strategies , based on monte carlo sampling , are mandatory . that notwithstanding , the various deterministic types of dynamics , fokker - planck , schrdinger , or monte carlo dynamics , classical or quantum , are not at all equivalent",
    ". there is in particular no relationship between the ( physical ) time appearing in the fokker - planck or in the schrdinger equation , and the corresponding classical or quantum monte carlo time - step .",
    "furthermore , _ many _ different types of monte carlo ( mc ) dynamics are possible .",
    "while sampling the same equilibrium probability distribution and hence providing the same equilibrium averages @xcite , they will generally perform very differently in an out - of - equilibrium situation .",
    "in order to appreciate that , given the large variability of the possible mc outcomes , it is once again wise to concentrate attention on landscapes which are well under control .    in this paper",
    "we implement and investigate different monte carlo annealing strategies , both classical and quantum , to the very same optimization problem  the one - dimensional double - well  which was studied in i by deterministic ( fokker - planck and schrdinger ) annealing approaches .",

    "[ ca_intro : sec ] that the choice of the proposed move in a metropolis mc scheme strongly influences the annealing performance .",
    "such a strong influence of the move is seen to be correlated with the instantaneous spectrum of the markov transition matrix associated to the mc scheme , as shown in detail in sec .",
    "[ spectral : subsec ] .",

    "it is possible to obtain a generalization of the lvy construction @xcite for this kind of lorentzian move , observing that both gaussian and lorentzian distribution are stable under convolution ( a property shared by all the so - called _ lvy distribution _",
    "the main idea is to obtain a closed form of the constrained kinetic operator : @xmath258 which is the probability of moving the @xmath55-th bead to @xmath259 , keeping fixed the @xmath260-th and the @xmath261-th beads in @xmath173 and @xmath262 , respectively .",
    "we recall that this object is the building block of the bisection algorithm @xcite . in the lorentzian case",
    ", it reads : @xmath263\\ , \\left[\\left(\\frac{x'_i - x_{i-1}}{\\gamma\\,\\delta\\,t}\\right)^2 + 1\\right]}\\;.\\ ] ] unfortunately , this is no longer a lorentzian distribution , and therefore it is not trivial to sample it ( for instance , by making use of the usual transformation technique ; see ref .  ) .",
    "however , after some algebra , and a smart change of variables ( taking due care of the jacobian of such a transformation , which changes @xmath52 onto @xmath264 ) , we obtain a simpler form : @xmath265\\,\\left[\\left(y - a\\right)^2 + 1\\right]}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 finally , with a bit of more algebra , we find that :      and also that @xmath270 .",
    "an efficient strategy to sample @xmath271 is , therefore , to sample @xmath272 and then to make use of the usual rejection technique ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the primitive of @xmath272 can be easily computed .",
    "it reads : @xmath273 inverting @xmath274 , and making use of an equidistributed random number @xmath275 $ ] , we find that : @xmath276 \\\\ -d + \\sqrt{d^2 + ( a^2 + 1 ) } & \\mbox{for } \\ ; u\\in({1\\over2},1 ] \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath277\\;.\\ ] ] provided @xmath278 $ ]  another equidistributed random number  we shall accept the @xmath279 obtained above according to the condition : @xmath280 it results from standard considerations ( see ref .  )",
    "that the average acceptance of this method will be around @xmath281 .",
    "( this means that in order to generate @xmath53 random numbers distributed according to @xmath282 , one has to try on average @xmath283 times . ) finally , the original middle - point value @xmath259 appearing in @xmath282 is obtained by inverting the original change of variables in eq .",
    "( [ change : eqn ] ) , @xmath284 this sampling method is a bit cumbersome , but it can be easily implemented as a computer algorithm .",
    "its generalization , namely @xmath285 , which represents the probability of moving the @xmath55-th bead to @xmath259 having fixed the @xmath286-th and the @xmath287-th beads in @xmath288 and @xmath289 , can be easily derived ( it is enough to change @xmath32 with @xmath290 ) .",
    "this is what one needs in order to implement the bisection scheme @xcite .    in this way ,",

    "we finally report the virial - centroid estimators for the kinetic an potential energy for the relativistic - pimc case : @xmath292 where @xmath293 is the centroid coordinate .",
