    "<S> we demonstrate two effects that occur in all diffusive superconducting - magnetic heterostructures with rotating magnetization : the reappearance of _ singlet _ @xmath0 correlations deep in the magnetic material and a cascade of @xmath1 , @xmath2 components ( in the two spin@xmath3 basis @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do so by examining the order parameter and josephson current through a multilayer with five mutually perpendicular ferromagnets . </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that so - called long- _ and _ short - range components are present across a proximity system with rotating magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter of cooper pairs tunneling from a singlet pairing superconductor ( s ) into a magnetic material has a distinctive character whether the magnetization is homogeneous or inhomogeneous . in a homogeneous ferromagnet ( f ) , pairs tend to break apart due to the exchange field and may acquire a net momentum to become a triplet as a result of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) effect @xcite . in this case , the spin states of the cooper pair have zero projection along the quantization axis , @xmath7 @xcite . if the magnetic material is inhomogeneous , the presence of rotating magnetization ( domain walls ) will further introduce components with @xmath8 as first pointed out in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one important difference between the various components is the spatial decay range of their exponential envelope . in a diffusive system , </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the @xmath7 components is determined by the ferromagnetic coherence length , @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 is the diffusion length and @xmath11 the exchange field of the ferromagnet ) @xcite , while the @xmath8 components decay with the characteristic normal coherence length @xmath12 . under typical experimental conditions , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the superconducting critical temperature of the proximity system . </S>",
    "<S> defining @xmath15 , the condition @xmath16 is thus generally satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , @xmath5 and @xmath8 are often termed short- and long - range components , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly assumed that the short - range components exist only very near interfaces while the long - range triplet components penetrate deep into the magnetic material .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , using numerical solutions of the usadel equations @xcite for multilayers and the derived , exact analytic solution of the wide , homogeneous f , that in diffusive inhomogeneous magnetic systems the distinction between short- and long - range components is inadequate since _ both _ @xmath5 and @xmath6 components are always present across the material and may constitute a non - negligible amount of experimentally measured current . importantly , this effect occurs in inhomogeneous magnetic structures even when the magnetization rotates over long enough distances to exclude antiferromagnetism as the reason for the survival of singlet components @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an experiment where the existence of singlet and triplet components can be independently probed deep in the magnetic material .    </S>",
    "<S> the mixing of @xmath5 and @xmath6 components across a material with rotating magnetization is best revealed in a multilayer of @xmath17 misaligned homogeneous fs embedded in a josephson junction . </S>",

    "<S> they are parametrized by the position @xmath62 in the f. the first case , depicted as the solid line that begins on the real axis , was obtained by placing a real value of the order parameter into eq .   at the left boundary of f ( @xmath66 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solution immediately generates an imaginary contribution to @xmath67 as one moves into the f. this is the signature of the @xmath7 triplet component due to the fflo effect . the other ( dashed ) curve is given a pure imaginary order parameter at the left boundary and also immediately acquires a real part and thus a singlet component in the f ( reverse fflo effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> the small arrows show that , irrespective of the composition of the order parameter at the left boundary of the homogeneous f ( the starting point of the thick curves ) , the flow of the solution always leads to a complex order parameter in f. this contrasts with the behavior of the order parameter in a non - magnetic metal presented in the inset of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ figure3 ] is particularly relevant for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] since it shows that the re - emergence of the singlet component in the f layer is not a product of the geometry we consider but an inherent property of eq .   or eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ usadeltheta],[usadelm ] ) . the singlet component in f `` of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] necessarily accompanies the transformation of the @xmath6 component in f into the @xmath5 one in f '' . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic model and fig .  [ figure3 ] also emphasize the importance of the boundary conditions for the composition of the order parameter inside the f.    having motivated the appearance of the singlet component ( solid blue line ) in f \" in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] with the analytic model , we proceed to explain the cascading effect . </S>",
    "<S> we find it useful to consider the _ </S>",
    "<S> gedankenexperiment _ where each layer is examined separately with _ effective _ boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , we calculated the order parameter simultaneously at all points of the multilayer , setting boundary conditions at the sf interface on the left and at the outer right edge of the fifth magnetic layer of s5f . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the purpose of describing the cascading effect and using the insight brought by the analytic model , we consider the influence of the gorkov functions @xmath68 at the boundaries of each f to discuss the order parameter in the f. since the differential equations are second order the values of the functions at both boundaries of a given f determine a unique solution inside that f.    using this approach , the @xmath8 component @xmath42 ( dashed black line ) in f is for example readily understood from the fact that the @xmath7 triplet component ( dotted red line ) in f contributes to the left effective boundary condition that generates the @xmath6 component in f @xcite . at the ff `` interface the magnetization is rotated again . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter at that interface is a different mixture of gorkov components and thus forms another left effective boundary condition for f '' . as motivated by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] the effective boundary condition at the ff `` interface generates @xmath7 components in f '' . </S>",
    "<S> similar effects are then observed in the next layers .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now the effective boundary condition on the right of each f layer . </S>",
    "<S> that boundary condition explains for example the existence of an extra @xmath6 component ( dashed black line ) in f. by the same mechanism as described above the @xmath5 singlet and triplet components of the order parameter at the ff interface generate the @xmath19 , @xmath6 state in f. given the actual boundary condition at the sf interface the latter component must necessarily vanish at that interface .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from the above reasoning that a cascade effect is observed by which the rotation of the magnetization at each interface generates a new linear combination of @xmath5 and @xmath6 components in adjacent fs . </S>",
    "<S> hence the presence in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] of the _ singlet _ component in f \" ( solid blue line ) ; despite its short - range nature in homogeneous systems , this component appears deep in the multilayer , at about @xmath69 of the sf boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> the description above was made in terms of effective boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the features of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] could also be described in the quasi - classical diffusive limit in terms of the diffusion of pairs in the mixed state on either side of each interface .    the cascading effect and in particular the re - entrance of @xmath7 components deep in the f multilayer has measurable consequences . </S>",
    "<S> considering the individual gorkov functions in the f `` layer we note that the @xmath5 components are _ largest _ by an order of magnitude near the ff '' interface and are outweighed by the @xmath6 as one moves towards the center of f `` . </S>",
    "<S> this change of the dominant character of the order parameter is seen in the josephson current as one increases the thickness of the central f '' layer . </S>",
    "<S> the critical current flowing through the s@xmath17fs multilayer is calculated using @xcite @xmath70,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the normal state resistance of the material and @xmath72 is the electron charge . in the configuration of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] , the gorkov vector @xmath73 has no @xmath62 component .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure4 ] displays the current for two magnitudes of the magnetization in f `` ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two regimes and introduce a transition thickness @xmath74 to distinguish them ; @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) for the solid ( dashed ) line . for @xmath77 the singlet component @xmath28 is the dominant contribution to the current and leads to conventional buzdin - bulaevskii @xmath78 transitions upon varying @xmath79 @xcite . by contrast </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath6 components dominate when @xmath80 and the expected monotonous decay is observed . </S>",
    "<S> it is surprising to find a @xmath78 transition for @xmath77 given that we are dealing with a wide magnetic structure ( @xmath81 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the very observation of this transition with increasing thickness of f '' would constitute strong evidence for the presence of @xmath5 components deep in the f multilayer .     </S>",
    "<S> josephson current through an s5fs junction as a function of the middle layer f `` thickness for two magnetization strengths @xmath82 . for small thicknesses ( @xmath77 , </S>",
    "<S> see text ) , @xmath5 components dominate resulting in conventional @xmath78 transitions of the current . for large thicknesses </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath80 ) , the @xmath6 dominates and leads to a monotonous decay . </S>",
    "<S> significant is that oscillations due to the _ singlet _ component in f '' are found in such wide junctions . </S>",
    "<S> same parameters as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a series of conditions must be satisfied for cascade and josephson current effects to be observed . </S>",
    "<S> the case of the s3fs system ( spin valve ) has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cascade effect is present in the trilayer as for any value of @xmath17 . in such systems , however , only an @xmath6 current is measured as indicated by the components of the order parameter in f of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] ; the @xmath6 always dominates the @xmath7 component . for this reason we considered a @xmath83 multilayer .    the findings exposed above lead to a few general remarks . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were made for a multilayer with discontinuous rotation of the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the cascading effect will also occur in the more general case of a _ continuously _ rotating magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing then occurs _ at each point _ in the sample and the presence of both @xmath6 _ and _ @xmath5 is thus found across the magnetic material , even in very wide magnetic films . </S>",
    "<S> inhomogeneous magnetization nearly always produces a mixed state and the distinction between short- and long - range components looses its meaning .    </S>",
    "<S> the question is thus generally not whether one has a long - range triplet current in an inhomogeneous magnetic josephson junction but , rather , how much of the current measured stems from the @xmath6 component . some systems , such as the exchange springs used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite see a fraction of their currents stemming from the singlet ( @xmath5 ) component despite being very wide . </S>",
    "<S> the features discussed here may also not be specific to rotating magnetizations . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable that similar effects arise in normal metal multilayers with spin active boundaries and interfaces .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we analyzed the order parameter and josephson current through a diffusive multilayer s5fs of misaligned homogeneous ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical solution of the usadel equations reveals the existence of a cascade effect where @xmath5 and @xmath6 transform between each other at the interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we provided an exact solution of the non - linear usadel equation in a homogeneous f to show that any state at its boundary necessarily evolves into a mixed state in f. an experiment on a s5fs josephson junction is proposed to reveal the existence of _ singlet _ components deep in the fs . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of our work is that through the cascading effect _ both _ @xmath5 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 components are always present as a mixed state in a magnetic material with a rotating magnetization , irrespective of its width . </S>"
