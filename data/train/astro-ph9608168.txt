    "<S> the universe that we know is populated by structures made up of aggregated matter that organizes into a variety of objects ; these range from stars to larger objects , such as galaxies or star clusters , composed by stars , gas and dust in gravitational interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that observations support the existence of a composite ( two  exponent ) power law relating mass and size for these objects . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss these power laws and , in view of the similarity in the values of the exponents , ponder the analogy with power laws in other fields of science such as the gutenberg  </S>",
    "<S> richter law for earthquakes and the hutchinson  macarthur or damuth laws of ecology . </S>",
    "<S> we argue for a potential connection with avalanches , complex systems and punctuated equilibrium , and show that this interpretation of large scale  structure as a self  organized critical system leads to two @xmath0 : ( a ) the large scale structures are fractally distributed and , ( b ) , the fractal dimension is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> both are borne out by observations .    </S>",
    "<S> = y    laeff96/019 + august 1996    _ subject headings : gravitation ; cosmology ; complex phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> _    each point in figure 1 represents typical _ </S>",
    "<S> ( average ) _ observational data for each of the structures known to exist in the universe whose mass is approximately the mass of the sun or larger . </S>",
    "<S> the abscissa of this log  log plot represents the characteristic linear size of the structure normalized to the size of the sun ; in the ordinate we have plotted one over the mass of the object normalized to the mass of the sun , or , what is the same , one over the number of suns that would fit in the structure if all its mass was made up of suns . </S>",
    "<S> the actual data is presented in table i.    a very clear pattern of a _ composite _ </S>",
    "<S> power law emerges from the figure : a power law for `` star  like '' objects ( s ) and a different power law for what we can generically call `` multistellar '' objects ( ms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two exponents are radically different and they are given by @xmath2 and by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are obtained by a simple chi  squared fit to the logarithm of the data of table i to two different straight lines : one line for the s  class of objects and another for the ms  class of objects . </S>",
    "<S> the fit properties are described in tables ii ( for s  objects ) and iii ( for ms  objects ) ; we see that the fit quality is _ passable _ for s  objects and _ excellent _ for ms  objects . </S>",
    "<S> the fit dependence on @xmath4 and @xmath5 is very mild : for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , whereas for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; with errors very close to what is shown in table iii .    </S>",
    "<S> thus we have the relation    @xmath14    with @xmath15 the typical mass of the object , @xmath16 its longitudinal size . </S>",
    "<S> the two parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 have the values quoted in the table for each class .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that there are two different power laws for the two classes of objects is a good indication that objects within each class share a common physical origin which is , in turn , different for each of the two classes .    </S>",
    "<S> it is a remarkable coincidence that a similar , composite power law , has been found @xcite to hold for the _ number of species _ of all different kinds of multicellular terrestrial animals versus their _ body length_. furthermore , the exponents for multicellular animals are very close to what we find in this paper , especially the exponent for the larger  sized species , which is approximately equal @xcite to @xmath19 , and would then correspond to what we have called the ms  class of objects .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the power law for the s  class of objects has been known for many years , and is the celebrated mass - radius law@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be understood using basic features of the astrophysics of stellar objects and dimensional considerations , as was done by eddington who related it to the mass - luminosity ratio . </S>",
    "<S> it codifies a great deal of information on the physics of gravitational collapse and the nuclear physics of stellar material . </S>",
    "<S> this power law holds for about one order of magnitude in mass and eight orders of magnitude in size .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of this paper is devoted to the power law for ms  objects . </S>",
    "<S> this power law is valid from open stellar clusters , the simplest type of objects in this class ( i.e. , the one with the smallest number of components ) , to the full universe , obviously the most complex of the objects in its class , and spans twenty orders of magnitude in mass and almost nine orders of magnitude in linear size as can be seen from figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship is clearly non - gaussian ( which would show in this log  log plot as a sharp , cut  off curve ) , and therefore implies the existence of some scale  free phenomena , _ perhaps _ revealing the presence of a critical regime , manifesting in the variety of structures we list under the category of multistellar objects in table i. all these objects would then have their origin in a _ common mechanism _ </S>",
    "<S> , possibly related @xcite picture of the large scale structure in the universe as a particular case , @xcite , of a very general class of phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> see below . </S>",
    "<S> ] to their complex many body nature ( in the sense that they are made up of _ many _ star  like objects ) , which is a property shared by all of them , and establishes a clear difference between these objects and the objects in the other class , characterized by being compact objects . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of `` gaps '' between the structures ( we do not know of any structures intermediate between , e.g. , `` globular clusters '' and  galaxies \" ) points in the direction of `` avalanche '' behavior and , perhaps , some form of `` punctuation '' in the sense of elredge and gould@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ordinate in these plots can also be interpreted , for example , as the @xmath20 dynamical  mass fraction of suns that would be contained in structures with longitudinal size equal or greater than @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation of the ordinate _ together with _ </S>",
    "<S> the results of our fit , specially for the ms  objects , remind one of the gutenberg  </S>",
    "<S> richter relation @xcite for earthquakes , another power law which describes the cumulative number of earthquakes , @xmath22 , of magnitude greater than or equal to a value @xmath23 through the expression    @xmath24    with exponent _ b _ typically slightly greater than 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this , like punctuated equilibrium , is again a phenomena which can be related to a form of avalanche behavior@xcite .    shifting the ordinate by @xmath25 , it represents the @xmath26 , i.e. , the logarithm of the total number of objects of a given dynamical mass fitting in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> thus one can think of an analogy with damuth s law @xcite of ecology which relates the population density , @xmath27 , of moving life  </S>",
    "<S> forms on the surface of the earth to their longitudinal size @xmath28 , according to    @xmath29    with power law exponent @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> it is very intriguing that as damuth found , @xmath31 , very close to our @xmath32 for multistellar objects .    </S>",
    "<S> can one gain quantitative understanding of this power law ? </S>",
    "<S> unlike in geophysics or in ecology , where a mathematical framework is less well defined , in cosmology there is a well defined formalism which at least permits one to attack the description of structure formation @xcite , @xcite . within this framework </S>",
    "<S> , the equations that describe density perturbations and structure formation in an expanding universe can be written in a form similar to the directed percolation depinning ( dpd ) model in 3 + 1 dimensions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known from computer simulations of dpd  models that they display self  organized critical behavior @xcite , @xcite ( i.e. they lead to power laws ) and , in particular , that the probability that an avalanche of time duration @xmath33 survives scales as    @xmath34    with @xcite @xmath35 , which is reasonably close to the exponent found here for the ms  objects . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the ( comoving ) longitudinal size of the object is related to the time it takes light to cross it by @xmath36 ; this is the time entering in the above equation . furthermore , since the  number of objects of a given dynamical  mass fitting in the universe \" is the same as the probability that an object of a given dynamical  </S>",
    "<S> mass is present in the universe , we see that our phenomenological ms  </S>",
    "<S> power law represents equation ( [ survival ] ) with @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> if one adopts this  avalanche \" interpretation of the ms  power law , there is a @xmath38 that arises from it . as shown by the authors of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in dpd  models the _  shell of unblocked cells in the interface forms a fractal dust \" _ , which can be related to the distribution of survival times for the avalanches , equation ( [ survival ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fractal dust is packed into  moving blocks \" which behave as quasi  </S>",
    "<S> particles and are distributed like a fractal of dimension @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension of the fractal ( or levy ) dust is related to @xmath40 through    @xmath41    where the dynamical exponent @xmath42 is defined as the exponent relating typical time scales to typical length scales , i.e. @xmath43 . in 3 + 1 dimensions , computer simulations of dpd  </S>",
    "<S> models @xcite give @xmath44 , and therefore the @xmath45 fractal dimension for the dust is @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of cosmological hydrodynamics are best approximated by the dpd  model for times in the history of the universe not very much after the decoupling era , and thus one expects that the predictions for scales in the realm of the galaxies and larger of  avalanche \" physics , as described here , will be the most accurate . </S>",
    "<S> it is very tantalazing ( a ) that the  avalanche \" physics interpretation leads to a fractal distribution of the largest structures in the universe , a fact which has been known since the time of the first large scale surveys and ( b ) that the value predicted for @xmath39 is so close to what is inferred from observations @xcite for galaxies , rich clusters and clusters of galaxies , @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> we end by making several remarks . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable that the reason why power laws with exponents so similar , but for such diverse and different systems , are present , is because the essential underlying physics is the laws of hydrodynamics together with some form of noise which models the huge number of  unforeseebles \" in a very complex system . </S>",
    "<S> the closeness in the values of the exponents , together with the @xmath48 connection to systems exhibiting self  organized critical behavior , such as earthquakes , the ecology and dpd , together with the correctness of the predictions derived from it leads one to surmise whether the universe is yet another example of a self  organized critical system , and that this is the general @xmath49 behind this phenomenology .    </S>",
    "<S> a final question is that one must understand how the two power laws are connected together or if they can be understood in terms of a single law encompassing both , and why the change of exponent takes place . </S>",
    "<S> this requires new ways of looking at gravitational phenomena and the large scale structure in the universe and , like other aspects of large scale structure physics @xcite , points in the direction of phase transitions and critical phenomena where a change of value in the exponent of the power law can take place as a consequence of a phase change . </S>"
