    "the behavior of large numbers of stars orbiting around a central massive rotating black hole is a subject of great current interest ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , merritt _",
    "et al._@xcite used n - body simulations to construct and evolve a cluster of stars around a massive black hole such as the one at the center of our own galaxy , and studied the perturbations induced by those stars on the orbits of hypothetical stars that might be used to test the black hole no - hair theorems @xcite . in separate work ,",
    "merritt _ et al .",
    "_ also analyzed the rate of injection of stars onto highly eccentric orbits around a massive black hole @xcite .",
    "such orbits would lead to an  extreme mass - ratio inspiral \" ( emri ) that would result in the emission of detectable gravitational radiation .",
    "generally , such n - body simulations must be evolved for long periods of time in order to allow for all correlations and relaxation mechanisms to be established , so as to develop realistic estimates for rates of particular events , such as emri production . in the case of @xcite ,",
    "the timescale was 10 myr .",
    "the simulations of merritt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite included the newtonian gravitational attraction between the stars and the black hole and between each other , as well as post - newtonian effects associated with the massive , spinning central black hole , including the dragging of inertial frames and the quadrupole moment of the black hole s field .",
    "the simulations of @xcite restricted attention to a non rotating black hole , but included the capture of stars by the black hole .",
    "a star - star encounter can place one star on an orbit with sufficiently small angular momentum that it can be captured directly by the black hole .",
    "this is a non - trivial effect : in typical simulations carried out in @xcite , out of 50 stars in the cluster , 17 were captured by @xmath0 myr , and 30 were captured by @xmath1 myr .    in @xcite",
    "the condition for a capture was simple : if the total angular momentum per unit mass @xmath2 of a star after an encounter with another star was smaller than the critical value @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass of the black hole , the star was deemed to be captured , the mass of the black hole was augmented by the star s mass , and the hole was given a suitable recoil .",
    "this value of @xmath5 corresponds to the well - known angular momentum of an unstable circular orbit in the schwarzschild geometry with conserved relativistic energy per unit mass @xmath6 .",
    "et al._@xcite call this the innermost bound spherical orbit ( ibso ) .",
    "the latter condition is appropriate here , because the stars are very far from the black hole in non - relativistic orbits when they encounter one another .",
    "accordingly , one can treat them as being barely bound ( @xmath7 ) from the point of view of the black hole s strong gravity .",
    "however , there is every reason to expect that the typical massive black hole at the center of a galaxy , including our own , will be rotating , perhaps even very rapidly rotating . as a consequence ,",
    "the capture of a star will not be isotropic : stars in prograde orbits will be less likely to be captured than stars in retrograde orbits .",
    "for example , for @xmath7 stars with orbits restricted to the equatorial plane , the critical angular momentum per unit mass for capture is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dimensionless kerr parameter , related to the black hole s angular momentum @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "the upper(lower ) sign corresponds to prograde(retrograde ) orbits ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this anisotropic capture could have important consequences for the evolution of the cluster , imparting a net angular momentum to it , for instance , because of the preferential loss of stars moving in a retrograde manner relative to the black hole .    for orbits out of the equatorial plane ,",
    "the problem is much more complicated , despite the presence of the additional `` carter '' constant of motion , which makes the mathematical problem completely integrable .",
    "generally one must resort to numerical solutions to study the behavior of orbits near this critical point @xcite .",
    "instead , we have found an analytic expression for the critical angular momentum for arbitrary orbits that is approximate , but surprisingly accurate over almost the whole range of black hole spins .",
    "it has the form @xmath12 because the total angular momentum is no longer a conserved quantity , we _ define _ @xmath2 in terms of the carter constant : @xmath13 ( all quantities are suitably scaled so as to be independent of the mass of the star ) .",
    "we also define @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the conserved @xmath16-component of angular momentum per unit mass . in the schwarzschild limit and the newtonian limit , @xmath2 _",
    "is _ the total conserved angular momentum and @xmath17 is the orbital inclination , with @xmath18 corresponding to prograde orbits ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 corresponding to retrograde orbits ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the function @xmath22 is a series expansion in @xmath9 shown below in eq .",
    "( [ fseries ] ) . with",
    "the series carried to @xmath23 , the solution ( [ lcrit0 ] ) agrees with numerical solutions for the critical angular momentum to better than @xmath24 percent for @xmath25 ; and to better than @xmath26 percent for @xmath27 .",
    "for the special case of the extreme kerr black hole ( @xmath28 ) , we obtain a separate , but very accurate analytic fit for @xmath5 as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "equation ( [ lcrit0 ] ) can be easily implemented in an n - body code as a capture criterion .",
    "the rest of this paper provides details . in sec .",
    "[ basic ] we review the basic equations for motion in the kerr geometry , and in sec .",
    "[ critical ] we obtain the critical value of @xmath2 for capture in the case of @xmath7 .",
    "concluding remarks are made in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] .",
    "henceforth , we use units in which @xmath30 .",
    "the kerr metric is given in boyer - lindquist coordinates by @xmath31 where @xmath4 is the mass and @xmath32 is the kerr parameter , related to the angular momentum @xmath10 by @xmath33 , with @xmath34 required for the metric to describe a black hole ; @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "we will assume throughout that @xmath32 is positive .",
    "timelike geodesics in this geometry admit four conserved quantities : energy per unit mass of the particle @xmath37 , angular momentum per unit mass @xmath15 , carter constant @xmath38 , and the norm of the four velocity @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 the version of the carter constant used here has the property that , in the schwarzschild limit ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 , where @xmath2 is the total conserved angular momentum .    solving eqs .",

    "( [ norm ] ) and solving for @xmath47 yields , after some simplification , @xmath48 where @xmath49 this potential can then be used to study turning points of the radial motion , and will be the key ingredient in studying the capture of particles .",
    "we now want to find the critical values of the constants such that an orbit of a given energy @xmath37 , angular momentum @xmath15 , and carter constant @xmath38 will not be `` reflected '' back to large distances , but instead will continue immediately to smaller values of @xmath50 and be captured by the black hole .",
    "the turning points of the orbit are given by the values of @xmath50 where @xmath51 , thus where @xmath52 .",
    "the critical values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath15 are those for which the potential has an extremum at that same point , that is where @xmath53/dr = 0 $ ] .",
    "but since we are choosing a point where @xmath54 , this is equivalent to @xmath55 .",
    "the chosen sign for @xmath56 also dictates that this point should be a minimum of @xmath56 , that is that @xmath57 , corresponding to an unstable extremum .",
    "stars will be injected into orbits that could pass very close to the black hole via interactions with other stars far away from the black hole , in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "after the encounter , the orbit of such a star can be characterized by its newtonian semi - major axis @xmath58 ( not to be confused with the kerr parameter @xmath32 ) , which will be large compared to @xmath4 , and thus the energy per unit mass will be given approximately by @xmath59 .",
    "if this encounter can be regarded as the final significant perturbation of the orbit by other stars , this energy , along with the other constants of motion in the kerr geometry ( @xmath60 ) will be conserved for the rest of the orbit . as a consequence",
    ", we shall focus attention on orbits for which @xmath61 .    in this case , linear combinations of the conditions @xmath52 and @xmath62 yield two quadratic equations for @xmath50 .",
    "these correspond to special cases of , for example , eqs .",

    ", we will _ define _ the new constants of motion , @xmath63 and @xmath29 , related to @xmath38 and @xmath15 by @xmath64 in both the spherical and newtonian limits , @xmath2 and @xmath17 correspond to the total angular momentum and the orbital inclination , respectively . in the strong - field regime",
    "close to the black hole , these quantities remain constants of the motion , but their interpretation is less transparent .    for orbits in the equatorial plane , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 for prograde orbits or @xmath67 for retrograde orbits . for general orbits , @xmath17 ranges from @xmath68 to @xmath69 for prograde orbits , and from @xmath69 to @xmath70 for retrograde orbits .    scaling out the factors of @xmath4 by defining the dimensionless variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 , we find that the algebraic equation for the critical value @xmath73 takes the form @xmath74 \\tilde{l}_c^6   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad   + 4 \\tilde{a } \\cos i [ 24 - \\tilde{a}^2 ( 1 +   9 \\sin^2 i ) ] \\tilde{l}_c^5   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad -\\tilde{a}^2 [ 240 - 192 \\sin^2 i - \\tilde{a}^2(1 + 18\\sin^2",
