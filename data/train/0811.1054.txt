    "evidence that supernovae may depart a little or even drastically from spherical symmetry has been growing for years . for core collapse ,",
    "we know that pulsars are somehow  kicked \" at birth in a manner that requires a departure from both spherical and up / down symmetry ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ) .",
    "the progenitor star of sn  1987a was asymmetric as are its surroundings and debris ( wampler et al .",

    "1989 ; burrows et al .",
    "1995 ; wang et al .",
    "the supernova remnant cassiopeia a shows signs of a jet and counterjet that have punched holes in the expanding shell of debris , and there are numerous other asymmetric supernova remnants ( fesen , 2001 ; hwang et al . 2004 ; wheeler , maund & couch 2008 ) . each of these observations is well known .",
    "the question has been : are they merely incidental or a vital clue to how core - collapse supernovae work ?    for type ia supernovae (",
    "hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ) the progenitor white dwarf has long been treated as basically spherically symmetric even though",
    "the popular model is that the explosion must take place in a binary system where the white dwarf grows to the critical mass by accretion of mass and , inevitably , angular momentum .",
    "there could be asymmetries in this sort of supernova resulting from the the dynamics of the combustion process , the spin of the white dwarf , the stellar orbital motion , a surrounding accretion disk , or the presence of the companion star .",
    "as for the case of core - collapse supernovae , this was known , but there was no compelling observational reason to consider departures from spherical symmetry .",
    "this , too , is changing .",
    "our understanding of the shape of supernovae has undergone a revolution in the last decade .",
    "the driving force has been a new type of observation : spectropolarimetry .",
    "when light scatters through the expanding debris of a supernova , it retains information about the orientation of the scattering layers . since we can not spatially resolve the average extragalactic supernova through direct imaging , polarization is the most powerful tool we have to judge the morphology of the ejecta .",
    "spectropolarimetry measures both the overall shape of the emitting region and the shape of regions composed of particular chemical elements . for a supernova with a typical photospheric radius of @xmath4 cm , the effective spatial resolution attained by polarimetry at 10",
    "mpc is 10 microarcsec .",
    "this is a factor of 100 better resolution than optical interferometers can give us at a small fraction of their cost .",
    "the maturation of spectropolarimetry of supernovae over the last decade occurred in parallel with two other immense revolutions : the supernova / gamma - ray burst connection and the use of type ia supernovae to discover the acceleration of the universe .",
    "understanding that core - collapse supernovae were routinely aspherical developed in parallel with the understanding that long / soft gamma - ray bursts resulted from tightly collimated beams of gamma - rays from some varieties of type ic supernovae ( woosley & blooom 2006 ) .",
    "surely there is a close connection between the asymmetry of  normal \" core - collapse supernovae and those that yield gamma - ray bursts . for type ia , the knowledge that they are asymmetric is a challenge for their ever more precise use as cosmological tools .",
    "wolstencroft & kemp ( 1972 ) argued that an intrinsic magnetic field dispersed by a supernova explosion might induce optical circular polarization .",
    "shakhovskoi ( 1976 ) proposed that electron scattering in an asymmetric , expanding envelope was the most likely source of any intrinsic polarization .",
    "shapiro & sutherland ( 1982 ) did the first quantitative study of polarimetry as an important tool to study the geometry of supernovae .",
    "they found that a mixture of scattering and absorption can yield a significantly higher degree of polarization than expected from the classical , pure scattering atmosphere discussed by chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) .",
    "more sophisticated models (  1991 ) predicted that , for a given axis ratio , the extended atmospheres expected for supernovae would provide even more polarization than a plane - parallel atmosphere .",
    "mccall ( 1984 ) argued that lines that form p - cygni scattering profiles in expanding atmospheres with non - circular isophotes should show a linar polarization greater than that in the continuum .",
    "he predicted that the polarization should increase at the absorption minimum as the absorbing material blocked predominantly unpolarized forward scattered flux from the portion of the photosphere along the line of sight .",
    "this would increase the relative proportion of polarized flux that scatterered from the asymmetric limb .",
    "there is also a tendency for the polarization to decrease at the emission peak because the emitted unpolarized flux will tend to dilute the underlying polarized continuum flux .",
    "the result has been characterized as an ",
    "inverse p - cygni \" polarization profile across an unblended p - cygni line in the flux spectrum .",
    "[ margin comment p - cygni line profiles form when outflow from a source , the star p - cygni or a supernova , yields an expanding atmosphere such that there is emission at the rest wavelength of a line from the transverse flow and blue - shifted absorption where the flow expanding toward the observer obscurs the photosphere . ]",
    "the first reported supernova polarization observations were by serkowski ( 1970 ) .",
    "other early attempts were by shakhovskoi & efimov ( 1972 ) , wolstencroft & kemp ( 1972 ) , lee et al .",
    "( 1972 ) , and shakhovskoi ( 1976 ) .",
    "it is not clear that any of these data represented anything but interstellar polarization .",
    "mccall et al . ( 1984 ) presented the first spectropolarimetric data on a supernova , the type ia sn 1983 g in ngc 4753 near maximum light .",
    "no change in polarization through the p cygni lines was observed .",
    "the polarization at about 2 % was probably due to the interstellar polarization ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "mccall et al . also looked for circular polarization , but none was detected .",
    "mccall ( 1985 ) reported observations of the type ib sn 1983n close to maximum light and noted that the polarization dipped from about 1.4 % in the continuum to about 0.8 % in the fe ii feature with no change in position angle , strongly suggesting an intrinsic polarization .",
    "unfortunately , the data were never published .",
    "spyromilio and bailey ( 1993 ) obtained spectropolarimetry of the type ia sn 1992a 2 weeks and 7 weeks after maximum light . they observed no significant variations across the spectral features .    the first events for which systematic spectropolarimetry was obtained were sn  1987a , an explosion in a rare blue super giant , and sn  1993j , an explosion in a star nearly stripped of its hydrogen envelope .",
    "we present a detailed discussion of these events below .",
    "these two events illustrated how poor the overall data base of supernova spectropolarimetry was up through the early 1990s .    in 1994",
    "we began a program to obtain spectropolarimetry of as many supernovae as possible that were visible from mcdonald observatory . at the time , as illustrated by this brief history , only a handful of events had been examined at all and there were virtually no statistics .",
    "the first few supernovae our group studied ( and those in the previous sparse record like sn  1987a and sn  1993j ) were classified as  peculiar \" in some way , so we did not know whether we were seeing incidental peculiarities or something truly significant .",
    "as data accumulated , however , this uncertainty was removed , and significant new insights were revealed . with more data and better statistics , we identified the first key trend : .",
    "the data were bi - modal ( wang et al .",
    "type ia supernovae showed little or no polarization signal near and after maximum light ( we discuss the prominent pre - maximum polarization below ) .",
    "supernovae thought to arise by core collapse in massive stars were , by contrast , all significantly polarized .",
    "so far every core - collapse supernova for which we or other groups have obtained adequate data has been substantially polarized .",
    "core - collapse supernovae are definitely not spherically symmetric .",
    "table 1 gives a list of supernovae observed with photometric or spectroscopic polarimetry .",
    "the polarization of an incoming signal can be characterized by its stokes vector , s , that comprises four components , or stokes parameters , i , q , u , and v ( chandrasekhar 1960 ) , where i is the intensity and q and u measure the linear polarization .",
    "the component , v , measures the circular polarization .",
    "while a portion of the light from a supernova may be circularly polarized , low flux levels have precluded any serious attempt to measure circular polarization , and it will not be considered here .",
    "the stokes vector has an amplitude and a direction , but since it is related to the intensity , which is the square of the amplitude of the electric vector , it is a quasi - vector for which the directions 0  and 180  are identical .    in general ,",
    "i is the total flux , q and  are differences in flux with the electric vector oscillating in two orthogonal directions on the sky , with  representing angles on the sky that are rotated by 45   with respect to those sampled by q. throughout this review , the normalized stokes parameters are defined as q  =  q / i and u  =   /i . in this way the degree of linear polarization , @xmath5 , and the polarization angle , @xmath6 , are expressed in terms of the stokes parameters as :    @xmath7    and    @xmath8    or @xmath9    the astronomical convention is that @xmath10 points to the north on the sky .",
    "the basic techniques of spectropolarimetry are presented by miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) , goodrich ( 1991 ) , del toro iniesta ( 2003 ) , and patat & romaniello ( 2006 ) ( see also van de hulst 1957 ) . because polarimetry involves the difference of the ordinary and extraordinary light rays , the per pixel errors are exaggerated compared to those in the total flux spectra and are artificial because each resolution element contains more than one pixel .",
    "it is therefore useful to rebin the data into bin sizes comparable to the spectral resolution to reduce the artificial per pixel errors and error correlations .",
    "care must also be taken that estimates of polarization from equation 1 are not biased to large values by noise ( simmons & stewart 1985 ; wang , wheeler &  1997 ) .",

    "polarization introduced by interstellar dust in either the host galaxy or the milky way galaxy can complicate the interpretation of observed polarization .",
    "fortunately , the wavelength dependence of the isp is well - quantified by observations of galactic stars ( serkowski et al .",
    "1995 ; whitett et al .",
    "the polarization from supernova ejecta is expected to vary across spectral lines and the wavelength dependence may be different .",
    "the supernova polarization also varies in time whereas the isp does not . in principle , these features allow separation of the supernova polarization from the contributions of the isp .",
    "there is no totally satisfactory method to derive the isp of supernova polarimetry observationally .",
    "many methods have been proposed , but they have to make assumption about the supernova polarization .",
    "examples of these assumptions are : ( 1 ) certain components of the supernova spectrum , such as the emission peaks of p - cygni profiles , are not polarized ( trammell et al . 1993 ; tran et al .",
    "1997 ) ; ( 2 ) that the blue end of the supernova spectra is unpolarized because of strong line blended depolarizing lines ( wang et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the first method also implicitly assumes a simple axially - symmetric geometry of the ejecta which is often ruled out by the observational data .",
    "it is thus often dangerous to derive scientific results assuming that one has an accurate _ a priori _ knowledge of the ( isp ) .",
    "if the isp is significantly larger than the intrinsic polarization of a supernova , the wavelength dependence of the observed polarization can provide estimates of the properties of the dust particles along the line of sight to the supernova .",
    "an estimate of the wavelength at which the isp reaches maximum can be compared to the that for the galaxy , around 5500 to see if the mean properties of the host dust are similar or different .",
    "the isp due to the dust lanes in centaurus  a was probed by observations of sn  1986 g and it was concluded that the size of dust particles are smaller than typical galactic dust particles ( hough et al .",
    "recently wang et al . ( 2003a ) studied the dust properties in ngc 1448 and found the size of dust particles are slightly smaller than their galactic counterparts , but are nonetheless consist with the properties observed in the galaxy .",
    "leonard et al .",
    "( 2002b ) observed a highly reddened type ii plateau supernova ( see  [ sniip ] ) sn  1999gi in ngc 3184 , and found that the polarization efficiency of the dust in ngc 3184 to be much higher than typical galactic dust .",
    "it is certainly important to get more polarization data of highly extinct supernovae as this is a powerful tool to study the elusive properties of extragalactic dust .",
    "the prominent spectral features of supernovae make it possible to deduce valuable information without accurate estimates of the isp .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2003a ) outlined a method to decompose the observed polarimetry into two components , equivalent to a principle component analysis with two components . in the q / u plane ,",
    "the two components correspond to the polarized vectors projected onto the so - called _ dominant axis _ and onto the axis perpendicular to the dominant axis , which we refer to as the _ orthogonal axis_. a dominant axis can often  but not always  be defined from the distribution of the data points on the q / u plane ( wang et al .",
    "the spectropolarimetry projected to the dominant axis represents global geometric deviations from spherical symmetry , whereas the vector perpendicular to the dominant axis represents physical deviations from the dominant axis .",
    "the coordinates of the new system are given by rotating the original coordinates counterclockwise so that the q axis overlaps the dominant axis in the new coordinate system and the dominant axis points toward the center of the data cluster on the q / u plane .",
    "the components parallel and perpendicular to the dominant axis are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the polarization components parallel to the dominant axis and orthogonal to that axis , respectively , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the stokes parameters of the isp , @xmath17 is the rotation angle in the q / u plane and @xmath18 is the polarization position angle of the dominant axis .",
    "an advantage of using these decomposition formulae rather than calculating the degree of polarization as given by equations 1 and 2 is that the spectral profiles of @xmath14 and @xmath13 are insensitive to the choice of isp .",
    "a similar procedure producing  rotated stokes parameters \" was employed by leonard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who calculated a fit to the continuum position angle so that all the continuum polarization falls on the rotated q. this is equivalent to , but not quite the same technically , as fitting a dominant axis in the q / u plane .",
    "the polarization spectral profiles of the latter decomposition method do not depend on the unknown isp .",
    "if the supernova ejecta are smooth and axially symmetric , the data points on the q / u diagram should follow a straight line defining the dominant axis , as expected from theoretical models ( hflich et al .",
    "if the geometry departs significantly from axial symmetry , the data points will show noticeable dispersion from a straight line , in the direction of the orthogonal axis .",
    "these basic situations and their representation in the q / u plane are shown schematically in figure  1 . in the top left of figure  1",
    ", we show a smooth , axially symmetric geometric structure with the axis tilted at an arbitrary position angle on the sky and , in general , with respect to the line of sight . for homologous expansion , v @xmath19 r ,",
    "surfaces of constant velocity are planes normal to the line of sight .",
    "viewing at different wavelengths through a line profile corresponds to viewing the geometry along different slices normal to the line of sight . in general ,",
    "due to the interplay of geometry and optical depth , different wavelengths will register different amplitudes of polarization and hence values of q and u , but at a fixed angle .",
    "the resulting wavelength - dependent polarization amplitude plotted in the q / u plane will follow a straight line ( top right ) , the dominant axis .",
    "a simple rotation of the coordinates would align the rotated q axis with the line . in this simple example",
    ", there would be no contribution along the orthogonal axis corresponding to the rotated u axis .",
    "in the lower left of figure  1 we schematically illustrate a case for which the axisymmetry is broken , in this case by  clumps \" of composition - dependent and hence optical depth- and wavelength - dependent structure .",
    "in practice , clumps of high - opacity , absorbing material will block parts of the underlying photosphere .",
    "this will induce wavelength - dependent geometry on constant velocity slices even if the underlying photosphere is symmetric and hence imposes no net polarization itself .",
    "clumps blocking an asymmetric photosphere will yield more complex structure , but no difference in principle . in this case",
    ", the polarization distribution in the q / u plane will no longer be along a straight line ( lower right )",
    ". the basic axisymmetric geometry may still be evident in terms of a dominant axis , as illustrated , but the departure from axial symmetry caused by the  clumping \" will yield a finite , and physically significant , distribution along the orthogonal axis .",
    "we use this basic phenomenology to define spectropolarimetry types in  [ types ] .",
    "the decomposition of the polarization components given by equations [ dom ] and [ orth ] assumes the existence of only two components with fixed axes : an isp component and only one additional component that is intrinsic to the supernova .",
    "this is clearly an oversimplification for some events , for which a more complicated decomposition is needed .",
    "a more realistic approach is to assume that the line polarization and continuum polarization have independent geometries and hence that the observed polarization is a combinations of the two .    while there are numerous ways of presenting and analyzing spectropolarimetry data , one clear advantage of displaying the data in the q / u plane",
    "is that it facilitates doing the requisite  vector analysis \" by eye .",
    "one can immediately and directly see how the amplitude and polarization angle will change with a change in the placement of the always uncertain and frequently controversial isp .",
    "likewise , the tendency of the data to fall along a single axis , or to depart from a primary axis in loops or other structures , is transparent , completely independent of the placement of the isp .",
    "we will take advantage of this power in the subsequent analysis .",
    "in general , the continuum polarization from a supernova provides information about the overall shape of the photosphere , whereas the polarization across spectral lines is more sensitive to small - scale structures in the ejecta .",
    "large - scale gradients in density and composition structure may also affect line polarization , but such effects are generally saturated for strong lines due to their large optical depth .",
    "if the composition structure is complex , then the degree and angle of polarization may vary significantly across strong spectral lines .",
    "the result is to produce  loops \" in the q / u plane .",
    "these loops are loci on the q / u plane that are functions of the wavelength across the line feature and hence functions of the velocity and of the depth of the portion of the structure that contributes to that wavelength . because the loops represent changes in the amplitude and angle of polarization as a function of wavelength , velocity , and depth , they are specifically evidence for breakdown of axial symmetry .",
    "the loops could be caused by composition - dependent clumps or more organized structures that nevertheless break the axial symmetry .",
    "an example of how loops may be formed is given in figure 2 taken from kasen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , a paper that also has an excellent pedagogical exposition of polarization in supernovae atmospheres .",
    "figure 2 was constructed in the context of the high - velocity calcium feature of type ia supernovae ( see  [ hivca ] ) , but the principles are quite general . in the case illustrated , an edge - on torus surrounds an ellipsoidal photosphere , both expanding homologously . that geometry breaks the axisymmetry .",
    "the torus has a strong absorption line that blocks the continuum emission from the photosphere , but the geometry of the blocking region depends on the velocity slices through the structure and hence on the wavelength across the line profile .",
    "the resulting locus in the q / u plane shows a loop that matches the observations ( of type ia sn  2001el ) rather well .",
    "complications that can be envisaged , many of which are discussed by kasen et al . , are an asymmetric photosphere , different geometries for the surrounding shell , and breaking up of the structure into clumps .",
    "as we shall see in the subsequent discussion , loops in the q / u plane , with their implied non - axisymmetric structure , are common in both core - collapse and thermonuclear supernovae .",
    "these loops represent an important new clue to the physics and the structure of both types of explosion .",
    "we can classify the spectropolarization characteristics of a supernova according to its distribution in the q - u diagram .",
    "this classification scheme follows directly from the principles outlined in figures  1 and 2 and is insensitive to the exact value of the isp .",
    "we define the following spectropolarimetric ( sp ) types :    _ sp type n0 : _ this type is characterized by polarization data with no significant deviation from a distribution that is consistent with observational noise .",
    "the centroid of the distribution may be offset from zero polarization due to interstellar dust , but there is no measurable supernova polarization .",
    "there is no dominant axis .",
    "_ sp type n1 : _ this type is characterized by polarization data with no significant elongation in any preferred direction , but for which the data distribution is wider than would be consistent with the observational errors , indicating intrinsic polarization or systematic underestimate of observational error .",
    "there is no dominant axis .",
    "_ sp type d0 : _ this type is characterized by data that show an elongated ellipse in a q / u diagram , with the distribution orthogonal to the major axis of the ellipse consistent with observational noise . the locus of the data can be well approximated by fitting a straight line ( except in the case of very strong interstellar polarization and very broad wavelength coverage ) .",
    "the position angle of this fitted line defines the dominant axis of the data .",
    "_ sp type d1 : _ this type is characterized by data that show an elongated ellipse in a q / u diagram so that a dominant axis can be identified , but for which a straight line does not provide a satisfactory fit .",
    "significant deviations are found orthogonal to the dominant axis .",
    "type l : _ some supernovae show large significant changes in the amplitude and position angle across strong spectral lines . these variations results in prominent loops on the q / u diagram .",
    "in general , the sp type is deduced from observations at a certain epoch and in a certain wavelength range .",
    "the spectropolarimetric properties of supernovae evolve with time , so the sp type as defined here can evolve as well .",
    "in addition , different portions of the spectrum may reveal different characteristics .",
    "the continuum or a single line could be a d0 , while another line could be an l. we have assigned tentative sp types to those supernovae in table 1 where the data justified it .",
    "we also use this classification to discuss individual events in the remainder of this review .    in order to characterize the data ,",
    "it is critical to correctly estimate both the systematic and the statistical observational errors . in additional to normal spectropolarimetric calibrations such as from observations of polarized and unpolarized standard stars , it is highly advisable to acquire two complete sets of polarization data each night .",
    "this allows the errors and stability of the spectropolarimetry to be cross checked with data taken with identical observational setups .",
    "the single most important conclusion to arise from the study of supernovae spectropolarimetry is that the process of core collapse routinely involves an intrinsically strongly aspherical explosion mechanism that is directed substantially along a single direction in space .",
    "prior to these spectropolarimetic studies , the explosion was assumed to be substantially spherical with any departures from spherical symmetry being due to rather small scale effects of convection or rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "the evidence for strongly directed explosions has given rise to a new literature of  jet - induced \" explosions and variations on that theme ( khokhlov et al .",

    "2006 ; udzenski & macfadyen 2007 ; and references therein ) . the spectropolarimetry of core - collapse supernovae has thus helped to catalyze a paradigm shift in thinking about the explosion mechanism .",

    "a recent key conclusion is that while a  bipolar \" structure is dominant in the geometry of core - collapse supernovae , departures from axisymmetry evidenced by loops in the q / u plane and other composition - dependent structures are also ubiquitous and must be incorporated in physical models .",

    "the continuum polarization probes the geometric structure of the photosphere .",

    "[ loops ] , as wavelength varies over a doppler - broadened line feature , different depths are sampled in the ejecta , with a given wavelength sampling a velocity  slice \" through the ejecta normal to the line of sight .",
    "the loops imply that the polarization amplitude and angle are varying along those velocity / depth slices .",
    "this means that there must be some substantial departure from axisymmetry in sn  1987a imposed on the overall  pointed \" behavior revealed by the photometric polarimetry .",
    "as we will now illustrate , this spectropolarimetric behavior gives a rich phenomenology that is ripe for progress in physical understanding of sn  1987a .",
    "these loops will give greater insight into the composition - dependent three - dimensional structure of the ejecta and are worth study in much more depth than allowed here .",
    "in subsequent sections , we will show that these loops and the implied non - axisymmetry , are not unique to sn  1987a , but common to all core collapse events .",

    "the data deserve a much more thorough quantitative study than has been done , or than we can attempt here , but several key themes emerge .",

    "there are fascinating and substantial departures from a simple  bi - polar \" explosion .    from the perspective of sp types defined in  [ types ] , the data can be classified as sp type l with respect to strong p - cygni lines : h@xmath22 , o i , and ca ii . across the entire optical wavelength range , the supernova shows an apparent dominant axis which is nearly constant with time and can be classified as sp type d1 .",
    "the he i line in figure 5 can be classified as sp type d0 .",
    "sn  1987a was clearly asymmetric with strong evidence for bi - polar , jet - like flow .",
    "this supernova also had obvious peculiarities ; its progenitor was a blue supergiant and a binary companion might have been involved .",
    "the question remained whether the asymmetries revealed in sn  1987a were peculiar to it , or clues to general processes in core collapse .",
    "one means to address this is to examine other type ii supernovae .",
    "type iip supernovae explode in red supergiants with extended hydrogen envelopes .",
    "their light curves display a long phase of weeks to months of nearly constant luminosity , called the plateau phase , as the envelope expands and the photosphere recedes by recombination through the envelope .",
    "these supernovae are thought to arise in single stars of modest mass , @xmath30 , and hence to be the most straight forward ,  generic \" type of core collapse supernova .",
    "for that reason , it is especially important to investigate their polarization properties .",
    "spectropolarimetry of type  iip was reported by leonard & filippenko ( 2001 ) and leonard et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "other examples are explored in some detail below .    for type iip supernovae ,",
    "the polarization is usually modest on the plateau phase , but probably not zero .",
    "the density structure of the envelope is expected to be nearly spherically symmetric because conservation of angular momentum is likely to lead to slow rotation as the envelope expands after core hydrogen depletion .",
    "a likely cause of the early polarization is an asymmetric distribution of radioactive elements that distorts the ionization and excitation structure even though the density structure remains essentially spherically symmetric ( chugai , 1992 ; , khokhlov & wang , 2001 ) .",
    "one of the best studied examples of a type ii was sn  1999em that displayed a classic , if long - lived , plateau suggesting an especially massive outer hydrogen envelope ( leonard et al .",
    "2001 ; wang et al .",
    "observations were obtained from about a week after discovery to about a half - year later .",
    "data for sn  1999em on a q / u plot are shown in figure 6 .",
    "the striking feature is that the data points concentrate on a single line as the wavelength and time vary . the same behavior is well - illustrated in figure 8 of leonard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that showed that the polarization of sn  1999em jumped from about 0.2% in the early phases to about 0.5% 160 days later , but with virtually no change in the polarization angle .",
    "the constancy of the position angle suggests a well - defined symmetry axis throughout the ejecta and independent of wavelength .",
    "leonard et al .",
    "note hints of non - axisymmetry ( their figure 16 ) , but the data is insufficient for detailed study . sn  1999em was a rather typical type ii plateau explosion , yet it demonstrated the key behavior of core - collapse supernovae emphasized in this review : the explosion of sn  1999em was aspherical and aligned along a fixed direction in space .",
    "sn  1999em would be classified as a sp type d0 or d1 ; a careful study has not been made of the dispersion in the orthogonal direction .    as a type ii plateau supernova continues to expand , the photosphere finally recedes through the hydrogen envelope exposing the ejecta from the heavy - element core .",
    "this is accompanied by a sharp drop in luminosity characterizing the end of the plateau phase of the light curve .",
    "the plateau phase is typically followed by an exponential decline in luminosity consistent with the decreasing deposition of energy from radioactive decay .",
    "the polarization tends to rise rapidly at the end of the plateau phase as the photosphere enters the core ejecta .",
    "this was suggested in sn  1987a , in which the polarization jumped from 0.2 to 1.2% at 110 days as the maximum peak gave way to the radioactive decay tail .",
    "this sudden transition was clearly observed in the careful campaign on sn  2004dj by leonard et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , as illustrated in figure 7 .",
    "the black points in the left panel give the visual brightness and show the end of the plateau phase and the transition to the exponential tail that is presumed to result from radioactive decay .",
    "the red boxes show the dramatic rise in the continuum polarization as the inner core is revealed .",
    "the right hand panel in figure 7 shows the behavior in the q / u plane from the spike in polarization at 91 days through the subsequent decline as the ejecta thin out and become optically thin to the scattering that induces the polarization .",
    "note the rotation of the polarization angle between the point at 91 days and the point at 128 days by about 30 , after which the angle remains essentially constant . the origin and evolution of the polarization of sn  2004dj has been discussed and modeled by chugai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and chugai ( 2006 ) who concludes that a bipolar ejection of radioactive @xmath31ni with more mass in the near rather than the far hemisphere can account both for the polarization seen in sn  2004dj and the asymmetric profile of the h@xmath22 line observed in the nebular phase . once again , the polarization of sn  2004dj is consistent with a jet - like flow that originates deep in the explosion itself .",
    "the rotation of the polarization position angle may suggest that the nickle is broken into clumps ( leonard et al .",
    "2006 ) , that other composition inhomogeneities disrupt the photosphere ( chugai 2006 ) or that the the axis of the  jet \" is tilted with respect to another measure of the geometry in the inner regions , perhaps the rotational axis of the core (  [ sn2005bf ] ) . the answer could , of course , be a combination of these effects .",
    "type iin supernovae are characterized by hydrogen - rich ejecta with narrow emission lines ( schlegel 1990 ) that are attributed to emission associated with substantial circumstellar interaction .",
    "the differences in the progenitors and their evolution that distinguish these events from classical type iip is not clear .",
    "spectropolarimetry can provide useful new information to address the issue .",
    "the first type iin with spectropolarimetry was sn  1998s .",
    "this event was observed by leonard et al .",
    "( 2000 ) about two weeks before maximum light and by wang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) about 10 and 41 days past maximum light .",
    "sn  1998s displayed narrow emission lines characteristic of type iin , but also lines characteristic of wolf - rayet stars that are not usual for this class .",
    "this suggests that sn  1998s had already lost substantial mass from its envelope so that , while very interesting , it may not be representative of all type iin .",
    "leonard et al . ( 2000 ) favored the interpretation that the broad lines were unpolarized and the narrow lines were polarized . with the benefit of two more epochs of data and the assumption that the isp does not vary with time , wang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) made a rather different estimate of the isp .",
    "this would give a continuum polarization at the first epoch of @xmath32 1.6% .",
    "this estimate of the isp also implies that both the broad lines and the narrow lines are polarized in the pre - maximum spectrum with the continuum displaying an essentially constant position angle .",
    "ten days after maximum , the continuum shows a somewhat smaller polarization with a rotation of about 34  compared to the pre - maximum data .",
    "the polarization then grows to about 3% while maintaining the same position angle .",
    "a full analysis of the polarization of type iin supernovae must also account for the physical state and geometry of the circumstellar medium ( chugai 2001 ) .",
    "hoffman et al . ( 2007 ) showed that type iin sn 1997eg displayed loops in the q / u plane over the h@xmath22 line .",
    "this implies that the continuum and line - forming regions had different geometries with different orientations .",
    "hoffman et al . suggest the that ejecta had an ellipsoidal photosphere and that the circumstellar medium where the hydrogen lines were formed had a flattened disk - like profile .",
    "deeper investigation of this supernova and the polarization of the narrow lines associated with sn  1998s are warrented",
    ".    type iin supernova usually show a clear dominant axis .",
    "they are thus usually sp type d0 or d1 in the continuum , some type iin show loops across spectral lines those features would be sp type l.      in the context of asking whether or not the asymmetries of core - collapse supernovae are peculiar to individual events or representative of generic phenomena and whether the asymmetries are associated with the fundamental mechanism of core collapse or peculiarities of the environment , the type iib supernovae represent an important test case .",
    "[ marginal comment the type iib events are defined as those that show distinct evidence of hydrogen at early times , but then distinct evidence of helium  similar to a type ib  at later epochs .",
    "these events are deduced to have lost all but a very thin layer of hydrogen , probably by transfer to a companion .",
    "the binary companion to the prototype type iib sn  1993j has been specifically identified ( maund et al . 2004 ) . ] by examining the type iib , one is intrinsically looking closer to the underlying machine of the explosion .",
    "important issues are whether this class of events displays properties similar to other core - collapse supernovae or properties especially characteristic of their class that might be clues to their origin .",
    "[ marginal comment sn  1993j showed an initial spike and decline in luminosity attributed to the  fireball \" phase as the shock hit the surface of the star and the shocked material rapidly adiabatically expanded and cooled .",
    "this was followed by a secondary peak and a final exponential tail , both presumed to have been powered by radioactive decay .",
    "the emergence of the helium lines that mark the class appeared near to the second peak . for",
    "an early summary of the polarization data , see wheeler & filippenko ( 1996 ) . ]",
    "doroshenko , efimov & shakhovskoi ( 1995 ) presented 6 epochs of ubvri polarimetry of sn  1993j spanning the rise and decline associated with the second peak in the light curve .",
    "they found that the u and b data followed a fixed orientation in the q / u plane , but that the longer wavelength data formed arcs or partial loops with time .",
    "doreshenko et al .",
    "suggested that the intrinsic polarization may contain two components that have different orientation and time variability .",
    "from the perspective of over a decade later , these remarks seem prescient .",
    "spectropolarimetry was presented by trammell , hines & wheeler ( 1993 ) and by tran et al .",
    "both papers assumed that the intrinsic polarization was zero at the peak of the h@xmath22 line , but differed on their treatment of the underlying continuum .",
    "we now recognize that h@xmath22 can be blended with he i 6678 making the assumption that the h@xmath22 is unpolarized highly questionable ( maund et al . 2007a ) .",
    "re - examining the data employing the constraint that the blue end of the spectrum may be substantially de - polarized , the estimate of the isp by tran et al . appears to be preferable to that of trammell et al . , although there are questions about the polarization angle assigned by tran et al .",
    "that may affect interpretation of the data . while we believe that the estimate of the isp by tran et al .",
    "is preferable to that of trammell et al .",
    ", we also note that the method used by tran et al . to subtract the continuum contribution and fit for the isp can have significant uncertainties in both the amplitude and angle that they do not assess .",
    "tran et al .",
    "note that they detect the rotation of the position angle across line features in their latest data showing that the emission lines of he i , fe ii , [ o i ] , and h are all intrinsically polarized with position angles that are different from that of the continuum .",
    "this also suggests some degree of non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "the data for sn  1993j displayed in a q / u diagram show little evidence for a dominant angle , but real deviation from zero polarization .",
    "sn  1993j is classified as an sp type n1 .      the type iib sn  2001ig was observed by maund et al .",
    "( 2007a ) over multiple epochs .",
    "they deduced low intrinsic polarization 13 days after the explosion , @xmath32 0.2% .",
    "this is consistent with a nearly spherical hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "there is a sharp increase in polarization and a rotation of the polarization angle by 40  by 31 days after explosion , after the hydrogen envelope has become optically thin . at this later epoch ,",
    "the data conform to a dominant axis and would be sp type d0 .",
    "the rotation of the position angle shows that the asymmetry of the second epoch was not directly related to that of the first epoch .",
    "as illustrated in figure 8 , the most highly polarized lines in sn  1991bg showed wavelength - dependent loop configurations in the q / u plane (  [ loops ] ) so that these lines , especially he i are sp type l. this demands some non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "sn  1991bg was one of the first examples of this loop morphology , a characteristic we have come to recognize as generic in core - collapse explosions .",
    "we cite other examples throughout this review .",
    "the polarization properties of sn  2001ig are similar to sn  1993j and sn  1996cb , but not identical .",
    "the observing epochs were not the same and the polarization evolves , so care must be taken in making comparisons .",
    "the data suggest that type iib supernovae may arise in similar binary systems , but not be so identical that they require identical observer angle , as suggested by wang et al .",
    "a further implication is that the class of type iib supernovae is not simply an artifact of viewing angle .",
    "spectropolarimetry may thus address an important open issue and invites deeper exploration of the nature of the evolution that leads to the progenitors of type iib explosions rather than to other types of hydrogen - stripped events .",
    "one possibility is that mass transfer in a binary system does not strip the whole hydrogen envelope and that some other process , perhaps a strong stellar wind , is necessary to produce progenitors that are completely stripped of their hydrogen .",
    "we explore those sorts of events in the next section .",
    "type ib supernovae are classified as those that show strong evidence for helium lines , but scarcely any evidence for hydrogen in the total flux spectra .",
    "the total flux spectra of type ic supernovae show little evidence for either hydrogen or helium . among the open issues",
    "are why type ib and ic are more devoid of hydrogen than type iib , how type ic are able to lose much of their helium as well , and which type ic are connected to gamma - ray bursts .",
    "a goal of continued study of type ib and type ic supernovae is to seek deeper understanding of the properties of asymmetry that are common to all core collapse events and hence important clues to the physical mechanism of the explosion .",
    "spectropolarimetry may also help to better understand why some progenitors expell virtually all their hydrogen and others , the type iib , retain a small amount .",
    "types ib and ic supernovae happen in stars that have already shed nearly all of their outer hydrogen layers , so they allow us to see deeper into the heart of the exploding star . the trend that these events tend to show more polarization than type ii supernovae was part of our argument (  [ bipolar ] , wang et al .",
    "2001 ) that it was the machinery of the explosion that was aspherical . in this section",
    "we explore the data that gave rise to that key conclusion .",
    "the first event that provided hints that type ic were more polarized than type ii and hence that the machinery of core collapse was intrinsically strongly asymmetric was the type ic sn  1997x ( wang et al .",
    "sn  1997x showed exceptionally high polarization , as much as 7% .",
    "much of this was due to isp , but the time - dependence showed that there was substantial intrinsic polarization .",
    "wang et al . suggested that the polarization of sn  1997x may have been as high as 4% .",
    "there seems to have been a steep drop in polarization in the first 10 days or so , a factor that requires explanation .",
    "sn  1997x displayed little or no evidence of helium lines in its total flux spectrum .",
    "that was the basis for its classification as a type ic .",
    "as illustrated in figure 9 , however , the polarization spectra showed clear spectral features associated with he i @xmath275876 and @xmath27 6678 .",
    "the helium absorption features peak at 15,000  and the wings reach speeds of 28,000 .",
    "this again shows that spectropolarimetry is a useful tool to reveal important aspects of the progenitor evolution by more tightly constraining the amount and geometry of the helium left in the outer layers of the progenitor .",
    "the spectropolarimetry supports arguments that there is a continuum between the type ib and the type ic , rather than a distinct transition between the two spectral classes . in the q / u plane ,",
    "sn  1997x evolves from an sp type n1 around maximum to an sp type d1 about a month later .",
    "sn  2005bf was an especially interesting example of a type ib / c supernova .",
    "it had a double peaked light curve with a first maximum about 20 days after the explosion and a second , brighter maximum about 20 days later .",
    "in addition , it resembled a helium - poor type ic in early data , but later developed distinct helium - rich type ib features ( tominaga et al .",
    "2005 ; folatelli et al . 2006 ; parrent et al . 2007 ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry of this event thus gave a chance to look for common aspects of core collapse , clues to the very nature of the type ib / c spectral classification , and evidence concerning the special nature of sn  2005bf itself .",
    "maund et al .",
    "( 2007b ) presented spectropolarimetry sn  2005bf from may 1 , 2005 , 34 days after the explosion , 18 days after the first peak in the light curve , and 6 days before the second peak when the supernovae was in the type ib phase .",
    "although the isp may have been substantial , intrinsic continuum polarization is still consistent with global asymmetry of order 10% .",
    "the data tend to fall along a single locus , suggesting a principal axis and jet - like flow , but also to show considerable scatter around that dominant axis .",
    "sn  2005bf showed a distinct loop in the he i @xmath275876 line ( figure 8) adding to the evidence for the ubiquity of such features , perhaps especially in helium , and further suggesting a departure from axisymmetry .",
    "polarization as high as 4% was observed in the absorption components of ca ii h&k and the ca ii ir triplet , rivalling that in sn  1997x .",
    "the calcium and helium showed different polarization distributions in the q / u plane .",
    "iron lines and the prominant o i @xmath277774 line were not polarized ( see sn  2002ap for a contrasting case ,  [ grb ] ) .",
    "sn  2005bf was sp type d1 overall and sp type l in the helium line .",
    "the spectropolarimetry helped to construct a picture of the nature of sn  2005bf that differed from those already in the literature .",
    "the basic premise of maund et al . was that the progenitor of sn  2005bf comprised a c / o core surrounded by a helium mantle ; that is , that the progenitor was structurally that of a type ib .",
    "the lack of fe polarization suggested that a nickel jet had not penetrated to the surface .",
    "the lack of o i polarization suggested that the photosphere had not receded into the c / o - rich core .",
    "this helium star was presumed to have its own axis of symmetry , probably a rotation axis . to that basic picture ,",
    "maund et al . added the  tilted - jet . \" a possible rationale for this assumption is given by core - collapse models in which the spin axis of the proto - neutron star is de - coupled from the spin axis of the progenitor star ( blondin & mezzacappa 2007 ) . in the  tilted - jet \" model",
    "the continuum polarization arises in the aspherical photosphere .",
    "the helium mantle contains a solar abundance of calcium .",
    "the calcium thus resides primarily in the photosphere and reflects in part the geometry of the photosphere .",
    "some of the calcium is also subject to the asymmetric excitation due to the buried nickel - rich jet that has penetrated the c / o core but not the helium mantle .",
    "this gives the calcium a different net polarization angle compared to the photosphere .",
    "unlike the calcium , the helium is only observed due to excitation of the nickel jet . since it has no photospheric component , it shows yet again another orientation , that of the jet .",
    "maund et al .",
    "suggested that sn  2005bf resembled a type ic early on because the photosphere had not yet receded to where the excited helium could be seen . at a later phase ,",
    "the excited helium could be seen and the supernova resembled a type ib .",
    "the notion that helium might appear in some events and not others and at different times in different events has long been discussed ( swartz et al . 1993 ) .",
    "sn  2005bf showed again that spectropolarimetry is a valuable probe of the similarities and differences between type ib and type ic .    while the tilted jet model was designed to qualitatively account for the characteristics of sn  2005bf , its basic features",
    " an asymmetric core that might vary in mass and composition and a tilted jet that carries asymmetric excitation to various depths and at various angles  may help to illuminate other core collapse events .",
    "sn  2008d , being observed as this review was completed , may be another example of a sn  2005bf - like event .      as remarked in the introduction , the gamma - ray burst revolution ( woosley & bloom 2006 ) unfolded in close parallel to the developments in the polarization of supernovae that we summarize here .",
    "there is a strong suggestion that since gamma - ray bursts are the result of jets , spectropolarimetry may also shed light on the supernova / gamma - ray burst connection ( wang & wheeler 1998 ) .",

    "they compare the statistical properties of the model to observations and comment on orientation effects that may contribute to photometric and spectroscopic diversity .",
    "kasen & plewa remark that their model , although based on a particular physical scenario , may be characteristic of a general class of asymmetric models .",
    "they made no attempt to compare to a particular supernova , but their total flux spectra do not give a significant o i line and hence their model does not correspond directly to sn  2004dt .",
    "type ia supernove are more polarized in the outer layers than the inner .",
    "this is an important clue to the nature of their thermonuclear burning .",
    "the continuum polarization is low showing that the explosion is nearly spherical , but the line polarization can be very strong . the line polarization may correlate with the velocity measured from absorption line minimum ( leonard et al . 2005 ) . some type ia show significant orientation with a dominant axis , but it is not yet clear whether this correlates with other properties , for instance the light curve decline rate . the future holds great promise to use spectropolarimetry of type ia to explore the asymmetries of the explosion , the nature of the progentor system , which should be intrinsically asymmetric , and the nature and geometry of the circumstellar medium .",
    "spectropolarimetry of supernovae is still a young field , but a number of basic conclusions can be reached that have important implications for the future of supernova research :    @xmath41 spectropolarimetry has now been obtained for every major spectral type of supernova : type iip , type iin , type iib , type ib , type ic , and type ia of various luminosity classes and peculiarities ( table 1 ) .",
    "they are all polarized and hence aspherical in some significant way .",
    "@xmath41 presenting the data in the q / u plane as a function of time , wavelength and especially across indvidual spectral lines is a powerful way to facilitate analysis of the data .",
    "@xmath41 core - collapse supernovae reveal larger asymmetry as observations are made deeper in the ejecta , either as the ejecta thins with expansion or the progenitors have less massive hydrogen envelopes .",
    "this is firm evidence that the explosion mechanism itself is strongly asymmetric .",
    "@xmath41 type ia supernovae display modest continuum polarization but very strong line polarization prior to maximum light .",
    "the polarization declines after maximum .",
    "this is firm evidence that the outer portions of the ejecta are especially significantly aspherical .",
    "@xmath41 core - collapse supernovae routinely show evidence for strong alignment of the ejecta in single well - defined directions , suggestive of a jet - like flow .",
    "@xmath41 core - collapse supernovae often show a rotation of the position angle with time of 30  40  that is suggestive of a jet of material emerging at an angle with respect to the rotational axis of inner layers .",
    "@xmath41 core - collapse supernovae frequently display loops in the q / u plane that indicate significant and systematic departures from the predominant axisymmetric structure .",
    "@xmath41 sn  1987a shows all of the features displayed by core - collapse supernovae : strongly directed flow , but also significant evidence for non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "sn  1987a is worthy of in - depth reconsideration in the current context .",
    "@xmath41 spectropolarimetry is an especially sensitive tool to study the presence and asymmetry of helium that is excited by non - thermal processes associated with radioactive decay .",
    "the helium , in turn , is an important clue to the nature and extent of mass loss from the progenitor , to the relations between type iib , type ib , and type ic supernovae , and to the asymmetric distribution of the radioactive elements .",
    "@xmath41 spectropolarimetry of supernovae can reveal information about the properties of the interstellar dust in the host galaxy .",
    "current data suggest that this dust frequently has properties different than dust in the galaxy .",
    "@xmath41 large scale asymmetries in the outermost , high - velocity portions of the ejecta of type ia supernovae are not consistent with pure deflagration models , but also not simply explained by delayed - detonation models .",
    "this remains a key challenge to models of thermonuclear explosions .",
    "hflich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argue that to some order the flux spectra of aspherical models can be reproduced by appropriate adjustment of the parameters of spherical models , for instance the radius of the photosphere , the density gradient , or perhaps some  microturbulence , \" so that it is difficult to deduce the geometry from the early time flux spectra of supernovae .",
    "certainly flux spectra are mute to important aspects such as different orientations for different chemical species and  loops \" in the q / u plane .",
    "nebular spectra may be more useful indicators of asymmetry since line profiles can reveal velocity asymmetries and small scale clumping structure , but again , there is no information on the relative orientatation of different chemical species .",
    "the totality of the evidence derived from spectropolarimetry of core - collapse supernovae is that the primary driver of asphericity is deep in the explosion process and that the explosion process often  aims \" at a certain direction in space .",
    "something resembling jet - like flow is strongly suggested .    as we have summarized here , recent",
    "work has revealed that departures from axisymmetry are also ubiquitous in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "much more needs to be done to quantify this significant clue to the physics and dynamics .",
    "two basic means to induce asphericity are from a distortion of the progenitor and a jet - like flow that can induce asphericity in both the density structure and the ionization structure .",
    "jet - like flow is likely to induce significant non - axisymmetric hydrodynamic instabilties : rayleigh - taylor , kelvin - helmholz , and richtmyer - meshkov ( wheeler , maund & couch 2008 ) .",
    "a non - axisymmetric geometry could also be achieved if the jet - like flow were tilted with respect to the progenitor geometry .",
    "there are physical reasons why the rotation axis of a newly - born neutron star and hence , presumably , the jet , could be different than the rotational axis of the progenitor .",
    "the jet could also penetrate to different depths in different circumstances , giving considerable variety to the basic picture .",
    "in addition , clumps of different density or composition could cause or contribute to the non - axisymmetry .",
    "ultimately there is also a need to understand the origin of such clumps with the jet being a potential principal source .",
    "it remains true that the characteristics of  high - velocity \" type ic may be the result of orientation effects in a mildly inhomogeneous set of progenitors , rather than requiring an excessive total energy or luminosity . in the analysis of asymmetric events with spherically",
    "symmetric models , it is probably advisable to refer to  isotropic equivalent \" energy , luminosity , ejected mass , and nickel mass .",
    "the discovery that routine core - collapse supernovae are aspherical and  jet - like \" may , in turn , give new insights into more exotic jet - induced events like gamma - ray bursts and x - ray flashes .",
    "we desperately need more high quality spectropolarimetry of stripped - core events .",
    "this has proved difficult in practice , but the few that have been observed have been exceedingly interesting .",
    "application of sn  ii to measurements of the distance scale need to be considered with care since even asymmetric luminosity sources in the plateau phase can give a small direction dependence to the luminosity ( chieffi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the asymmetries observed in type ia may finally yield direct observational evidence that they occur in binary systems , as long assumed , and clues to the combustion mechanism . at this writing , there is no fully acceptable model of the origin of the composition - dependent aspherical structure of type ia supernovae , certainly not the possible variation of that structure within the distribution of other observed properties of type ia . in particular ,",
    "neither pure deflagration nor delayed detonation nor gravitationally - confined detonation models fully account for the observations . on the contrary ,",
    "the spectropolarimetry has offered a new window by which to characterize the nature of the explosion .",
    "as the sample grows , we should more deeply understand the nature of the explosion and how it varies among the normal , luminous , and subluminous type ia , and among the high - velocity gradient , broad - line , low - velocity and other sub - genres of the species , such as the hydrogen - rich sn  2002ic and the especially  weird \" sn  2002cx .",
    "the seemingly ubiquitous , substantially polarized high - velocity ca ii feature is an especially important aspect to explore with spectropolarimetry .",
    "understanding these asymmetries may be necessary to properly interpret future data on cosmologically distant type ia s .",
    "this topic is still in a data - driven phase , but there has been much excellent work to lay the ground for understanding ( jeffery 1989 , 1990 , 1991b ;  1991 ; chugai 1992 , 2001 , 2006 ; kasen et al .",
    "2003 ; kasen et al .",
    "much of the basic understanding of the possible behavior of polarized supernovae , especially of the continuum , has been elucidated in terms of ellipsoidal models (  1991 ;  1995a ;  et al . 1996 ) .",
    "prolate models tend to require a larger distortion than oblate models to produce the same net polarization ( hflich et al .",
    "the true geometry may , of course , be some combination of oblate and prolate and more complex than captured easily by ellipsoidal structures .",
    "exploring more complex structures requires more general models .",
    "monte carlo radiative transfer models are the most likely to provide the needed generality of the underlying geometry and the capacity to handle the associated radiative transfer with a realistic amount of computer time .",
    "contemporary examples of this are the hydra code written by  ( 2005 ) and the sedona code written by kasen ( see kasen et al .",
    "2006 ) which have been applied to a number of problems , especially those associated with type ia .",
    "these codes treat aspherical geometries , gamma - ray deposition , and line and continuum transfer .",
    "they can compute models for the light curves and for the spectral and polarimetric evolution as observed from arbitrary viewing angles .",
    "there are two ways to approach the analysis of polarization data .",
    "one is the solution of the  forward \" problem for which a dynamical model is proposed or simulated and the polarimetric evolution is computed to compare with observations .",
    "the solution of the ",
    "backward \" problem consists of proceeding from the observed data to deduce the geometry of the ejecta . in practice",
    ", progress will be made by a process of iteration between these two techniques .",
    "codes such as these will play a vital role in this iteration .",
    "this phase of supernova polarimetry research is just beginning , but holds great promise as the data base expands .",
    "the authors are grateful to their fellow members of the vlt spectropolarimetry team for so much of the hard work and insight that made this review possible : pi dietrich baade , peter hflich , nando patat , alejandro clocchiatti , and justyn maund .",
    "special thanks go to peter hflich for his modeling work and early support of the texas spectropolarimetry program when it was first getting off the ground .",
    "jcw is also especially grateful to justyn maund for extensive and insightful discussions of supernova polarimetry and related topics and for his help with some of the graphics used here .",

    "<S> overwhelming evidence has accumulated in recent years that supernova explosions are intrinsically 3-dimensional phenomena with significant departures from spherical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we review the evidence derived from spectropolarimetry that has established several key results : virtually all supernovae are significantly aspherical near maxim light ; core - collapse supernovae behave differently than thermonuclear ( type ia ) supernovae ; the asphericity of core - collapse supernovae is stronger in the inner layers showing that the explosion process itself is strongly aspherical ; core - collapse supernovae tend to establish a preferred direction of asymmetry ; the asphericity is stronger in the outer layers of thermonuclear supernovae providing constraints on the burning process . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the utility of the q / u plane as a diagnostic tool and revisit sn  1987a and sn  1993j in a contemporary context . </S>",
    "<S> an axially - symmetric geometry can explain many basic features of core - collapse supernovae , but significant departures from axial symmetry are needed to explain most events . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a spectropolarimetry type to classify the range of behavior observed in polarized supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> understanding asymmetries in supernovae is important for phenomena as diverse as the origins of @xmath0-ray bursts and the cosmological applications of type ia supernovae in studies of the dark energy content of the universe .    </S>",
