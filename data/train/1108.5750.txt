    "the generation of energetic particles during flares remains a central unsolved issue in solar physics .",
    "extensive observational evidence indicates that a substantial fraction of the energy released during a flare rapidly accelerates charged particles , with electrons reaching @xmath2 mev and ions @xmath2 gev / nucleon @xcite . explaining this energization requires accounting not only for the relevant energy and time scales but also the resulting spectra , which exhibit a common shape for almost all ion species . at the same time , high mass - to - charge ( @xmath1 ) ions are greatly over - represented in flares , with abundances as much as two orders of magnitude higher than normal coronal values @xcite .    in impulsive flare models ,",
    "magnetic reconnection is the ultimate energy source , and so it is natural to consider theories in which reconnection also plays a role in particle acceleration . some models , including those that rely on interactions with magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves @xcite or shock acceleration @xcite , use reconnection only as an indirect source that provides an environment in which other energization processes can occur .",
    "in other models , the magnetic energy released during reconnection is more directly channeled to particles through various processes  dc electric fields @xcite , interactions with multiple magnetic islands @xcite , first - order fermi acceleration @xcite , or the pickup of collisionally ionized neutrals @xcite .",
    "also a member of this latter group is the direct heating of ions in reconnection exhausts @xcite , in which the perpendicular and parallel ( relative to the magnetic field ) temperatures of ions jump after traversing the narrow boundary layer separating the ions that flow slowly in from upstream from the reconnection exhaust , which travels at the alfvn speed @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the strength of the magnetic field and @xmath5 is the density .",
    "however these works considered the weak guide field limit in which ion heating is parallel , rather than transverse , to the local magnetic field ; @xcite have shown that in the extended solar corona , @xmath6 .",
    "subsequently , @xcite used test particles in a hall mhd simulation with a large guide field ( five times larger than the reconnecting field ) to confirm that ions above a critical value of @xmath1 become demagnetized .",
    "they suggested that ions crossing into reconnection outflows can become non - adiabatic , and hence behave like pickup particles embedded in a high - velocity plasma .",
    "it plays an important role throughout the heliosphere , and particularly in the solar wind . ]",
    "@xcite , while gaining an effective thermal velocity equal to the alfvn speed and derived a @xmath1-based threshold for this behavior .",
    "this process is similar to an earlier proposal by @xcite that ion acceleration in impulsive flares can occur via reconnection - associated pickup , although in that case the accelerated ions were produced by neutral - particle ionization in the lower corona .",
    "later hybrid simulations by @xcite confirmed that injected protons ( mimicking newly ionized particles ) did behave like pickup particles in this scenario .    in this letter , we use a kinetic particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation to track two types of ions self - consistently , i.e. without resorting to test particles , to determine whether particles above the critical value of @xmath1 behave like pickup particles in dynamic electromagnetic fields .",
    "ions with @xmath1 below the threshold derived in @xcite ( protons , in this case ) are adiabatic and undergo very little heating as they move between the upstream plasma and the reconnection exhaust , while particles above the threshold ( @xmath0 particles ) gain an effective thermal velocity equal to the exhaust velocity after crossing the narrow boundary layer surrounding the exhaust .",
    "the transition between adiabatic and non - adiabatic behavior depends on the ratio between a particle s cyclotron period and the the time it takes to cross the boundary layer @xcite .",
    "an adiabatic particle turns sharply in the outflowing direction upon entering the exhaust , conserving its magnetic moment @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the ion perpendicular velocity with the @xmath9 contribution subtracted ( the ion perpendicular velocity is taken relative to @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , particles which behave non - adiabatically move in the direction of the local electric field upon entering the exhaust and not in the direction of the local @xmath9 velocity .",
    "the sudden change from slow upstream inflow to downstream alfvnic outflow causes particles with high @xmath1 to see a jump in their magnetic moments .",
    "we carry out simulations using the code p3d @xcite .",
    "like all pic codes , it tracks individual particles ( @xmath11 in this work ) as they move through electromagnetic fields that are defined on a mesh .",
    "unlike more traditional fluid representations ( e.g. , mhd ) , pic codes correctly treat small lengthscales and fast timescales , which are particularly important for understanding the x - line and separatrices during magnetic reconnection .",
    "the simulated system is periodic in the @xmath12 plane , where flow into and away from the x - line are parallel to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and the guide magnetic field and reconnection electric field parallel @xmath15 .",
    "the initial magnetic field and density profiles are based on the harris equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the reconnecting magnetic field is given by @xmath16- \\tanh[(y-3l_y/4)/w_0]-1 $ ] , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the half - width of the current sheets and the box size in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the density comprises an ambient background and two current sheets in which the density rises in order to maintain pressure balance with the magnetic field .",
    "we initiate reconnection with a small initial magnetic perturbation that produces a single magnetic island on each current layer .",
    "the code is written in normalized units in which magnetic fields are scaled to the asymptotic value of the reversed field @xmath19 , densities to the value at the center of the reconnecting current sheet minus the uniform background density , velocities to the proton alfvn speed @xmath20 , times to the inverse proton cyclotron frequency in @xmath19 , @xmath21 , lengths to the proton inertial length @xmath22 and temperatures to @xmath23 .",
    "the proton to electron mass ratio is taken to be @xmath24 , in order to minimize the difference between pertinent length scales and hence run as large a simulation domain as possible .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the rate of magnetic reconnection and structure of the outflow exhaust do not depend on this ratio , and neither , therefore , does the ion heating examined here , which depends only on the exhaust geometry .",
    "the simulation assumes @xmath25 , i.e. that field and particle quantities do not vary in the out - of - plane direction , making this a two - dimensional simulation .",
    "in addition to the usual protons and electrons , we also include a number density of @xmath26 @xmath27he@xmath28 ( @xmath0 ) particles in the background particle population and gave them an initial temperature equal to that of the protons",
    ". this number density does not affect the reconnection dynamics appreciably , while still providing a large sample of particles with @xmath29 , where @xmath1 is normalized to the proton value .",
    "each particle ( protons and @xmath0 s ) is assigned a unique tag number , allowing individual particles to be tracked throughout the simulation .    in fig .",
    "[ jandvx ] we show an overview of results from a simulation with a computational domain @xmath30 and an initial guide field @xmath31 at @xmath32 .",
    "the grid spacing for this run is @xmath33 , the electron , proton , and @xmath0 temperatures , @xmath34 , are initially uniform and the velocity of light is @xmath35 .",
    "the half - width of the initial current sheet , @xmath36 , is @xmath37 and the background density is @xmath38 .",
    "panel ( a ) depicts the total out - of - plane current density @xmath39 centered around the x - line ( at @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) of one of the current sheets .",
    "magnetic field lines ( not shown ) roughly trace contours of @xmath42 .",
    "ambient plasma from above and below the current sheet slowly flows toward the current sheet while embedded in oppositely directed magnetic field ( to the right above the layer , to the left below ) .",
    "reconnected field lines are highly bent and , to reduce their magnetic tension , rapidly move away from the x - line , dragging plasma with them .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) show the proton and @xmath0 outflow velocities @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the similarity between the two makes it clear that both the protons and the @xmath0 s participate in the reconnection outflow which , outside of the immediate vicinity of the x - line , has a magnitude of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 , in our normalized units ) . a comparison of fig .  [ jandvx ] to frames ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  1 in @xcite ( which shows results from a run otherwise identical but for the presence of the @xmath0 particles ) demonstrates that the @xmath0 s do not significantly change the structure of the reconnection exhaust .",
    "particle acceleration is controlled by the structure and magnitude of the electric field . during reconnection a strong transverse electric field",

    "particles enter the exhaust with a velocity @xmath49 .",
    "any energy gain is determined by whether particles crossing the exhaust boundary , which has scale length given by the ion sound larmor radius @xmath50 ( @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the plasma sound speed ) , are adiabatic .",
    "non - adiabatic particles cross the boundary in a time @xmath53 that is short compared with their cyclotron period , @xmath54 , or @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present simulations , where the upstream @xmath57 , equation [ mqcrit ] gives @xmath29 for non - adiabatic behavior and so protons are marginally adiabatic while @xmath0 s ( @xmath58 ) are not .",
    "since @xmath59 in this case , non - adiabatic positively charged ions entering the exhaust from below will be pushed out immediately , preventing them from being caught up in the exhaust . however , non - adiabatic positively charged ions entering from the top will find themselves essentially at rest in the simulation frame while the outflow moves past at roughly the alfvn speed .",
    "such particles will undergo an @xmath9 drift , but with a `` thermal velocity '' equal to the alfvn speed and have trajectories resembling cycloids .",
    "this process is analogous to that undergone by stationary neutral atoms surrounded by the moving solar wind .",
    "if ionized , the new ion first moves in the direction of the motional electric field in order to gain the necessary energy to flow with the rest of the wind .",
    "as it gets `` picked up '' , it gains a thermal velocity equal to the solar wind velocity @xcite .",
    "we randomly selected 500 protons and 500 @xmath0 particles from the @xmath60 box upstream of the exhaust shown in fig .",

    "the proton , which remains adiabatic , immediately moves downstream upon entering the exhaust , while the @xmath0 particle moves in the direction of @xmath62 before being picked up by the @xmath9 drift .",
    "panel ( b ) displays the time evolution of the proton ( black ) and @xmath0 ( green ) magnetic moments ( scaled by mass ) .",
    "the vertical red line corresponds to the time at which @xmath62 is shown in ( a ) . after crossing the boundary layer into the exhaust ,",
    "the @xmath0 becomes demagnetized , as indicated by the jump in @xmath64 , a trend seen for all of the tracked @xmath0 s . in ( c )",
    "we plot the magnetic moments of all 500 protons ( black ) and all 500 @xmath0 s ( green ) after entering the exhaust versus their moments at @xmath32 . for each particle @xmath65",
    "was measured when the particle crossed a specified horizontal position at the downstream edge of the exhaust , around @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ mudata](a ) . for reference , we overplot a line of unit slope , which corresponds to exact @xmath64 conservation .",
    "the clustering of protons near this line and large values of @xmath67 reached by the @xmath0 s clearly shows the adiabatic nature of the former and the non - adiabatic nature of the latter .    in fig .",
    "[ temperature ] we show the temperatures of both species .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) depict the perpendicular ( to the magnetic field ) @xmath0 and proton temperatures , while ( c ) and ( d ) show the parallel temperatures .",
    "the @xmath0 temperature increase is greater than the proton temperature in the perpendicular direction ( note the different color bar scales in the two panels ) .",
    "indeed , the temperature increase of the @xmath0 s is more than mass proportional , consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "this is also evident in frames ( e ) and ( f ) , which are cuts through the perpendicular and parallel temperature plots for the @xmath0 s ( red ) and protons ( black ) .",
    "the weak heating of the protons is consistent with the adiabatic behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ mudata ] .",
    "the analysis of @xcite predicts that , with a guide field of @xmath68 , the proton temperature will change by @xmath69 in the exhaust , and the @xmath0 temperature will change by : @xmath70 for @xmath71 ( see fig .",
    "[ jandvx ] ) these jumps are in reasonable agreement with the observed variations .",
    "differences from the predicted values , in particular the changes in @xmath72 for the protons and @xmath73 for the @xmath0 s , presumably arise from corrections to equations ( [ protondt ] ) and ( [ alphadt ] ) due to a mixture of adiabatic and non - adiabatic behavior by the particles .    in fig .",
    "[ vel2d ] , we show how the velocity distributions of the @xmath0 s and protons change as they move from the upstream to the downstream region .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( d ) depict the upstream @xmath0 and proton velocity distribution in the @xmath74 plane . the protons and @xmath0 s were given the same initial temperature , so upstream of the exhaust , the protons mean thermal velocity is higher than the @xmath0 particles. the small negative @xmath75 component upstream in both species shows the inflow toward the reconnection exhaust . after crossing the narrow boundary layer , the @xmath0",
    "s get picked up by the alfvnic outflow ( at this time the local density is @xmath76 0.2 , so the local alfvn speed is @xmath77 ) , and their thermal velocity increases much more than that of the adiabatic protons .",
    "the downstream velocity distributions for the @xmath0 s and protons are shown in the @xmath74 plane in ( b ) and ( e ) and in the @xmath78 plane in ( c ) and ( f ) , both calculated inside a box located between @xmath79 in the x - direction and @xmath80 in the y - direction . since the dominant @xmath10 component is the guide field , @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "are essentially perpendicular velocity components , and @xmath83 the parallel velocity .",

    "the @xmath0 particles are strongly heated in the y - direction ( fig .  [ vel2d](b ) ) and are beginning to form a ring distribution that is characteristic of pickup behavior . there is modest heating of @xmath0 particles in the z - direction ( fig .",
    "[ vel2d](c ) ) , but the similar structure in ( c ) and ( f ) suggests that the heating mechanism is the same for both protons and @xmath0 s , and it is possible that the @xmath0 particles are not completely non - adiabatic .",
    "using self - consistent tracking of particle trajectories , we have shown that ions above a critical mass - to - charge threshold @xcite behave like pickup ions in reconnection exhausts , with @xmath64 changing due to a sharp increase in @xmath85 .",
    "ion energy increments of @xmath86 kev / nucleon are predicted for typical coronal parameters of @xmath87 g and @xmath88 .",
    "ions below this threshold are only weakly heated .",
    "this transition only exists for reconnection with a guide field which , however , is the typical case in the solar corona .",
    "coronal observations have revealed that the abundances of high mass - to - charge ions are enhanced in solar flares , with the strength of the enhancement depending only on @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that we observe non - adiabatic behavior and associated strong heating for particles with @xmath29 , while the proton heating remains weak , suggests that reconnection might explain the abundance enhancements in impulsive flares .",
    "abundance enhancements should occur because high @xmath1 ions are heated at lower values of the reconnecting magnetic field strength ( see eq .  [ mqcrit ] ) than protons .",
    "furthermore , the increase in @xmath89 in the exhaust seen here is consistent with that observed in the extended solar corona @xcite , although it should be noted that the number density of @xmath0 particles used here is slightly less than what is observed in the corona ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "observations near 1 au of solar wind reconnection events with the wind spacecraft ( as , for example , in @xcite ) should be able to measure @xmath73 and @xmath72 for both protons and @xmath0 particles in order to test the mechanism suggested in this work .",
    "moreover , provided its instrumentation can differentiate between different @xmath1 ions , the upcoming solar probe plus mission , with a planned perihelion of @xmath91 ( which lies within the outer corona ) , should also provide an excellent test of these predictions .",
    "finally , it is widely believed that some process converts a fraction of the energy found in the convective motions of the solar photosphere into the heat that ensures the continuous existence of a @xmath92 corona and accelerates the solar wind . broadly speaking the two most likely candidates are wave heating  in which oscillations generated in the photosphere travel into the corona ,",
    "develop into turbulence , and eventually dissipate  and magnetic reconnection , in which the topological reorganization of the magnetic field releases energy and heats the plasma .",
    "measurements by the solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ) and ultraviolet coronal spectrometer ( uvcs ) instruments of the soho ( solar and heliospheric observatory ) spacecraft provide significant constraints on any theory of coronal heating",
