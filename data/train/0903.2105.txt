    "<S> we study lifshitz tails for random schrdinger operators where the random potential is alloy type in the sense that the single site potentials are independent , identically distributed , but they may have various function forms . we suppose the single site potentials are distributed in a finite set of functions , and we show that under suitable symmetry conditions , they have lifshitz tail at the bottom of the spectrum except for special cases . when the single site potential is symmetric with respect to all the axes , we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of lifshitz tails . as an application , we show that certain random displacement models have lifshitz singularity at the bottom of the spectrum , and also complete the study of continuous anderson type models undertaken in  @xcite . </S>"
