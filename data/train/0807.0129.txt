    "the formation of these ice mantles is especially important in the process of star and planet formation , when a large fraction of heavy elements can be depleted onto grains . in the dense cloud phase water layers form on the bare grain surfaces . then during the gravitational ( pre-)collapse , virtually all gas phase species freeze - out on top of these water layers resulting in a co dominated layer that likely also contains traces of o@xmath0 but very little water .",
    "the observed h@xmath0o ice abundance can not be explained by direct accretion from the gas phase only . the exact mechanism by which water ice is formed is not understood .",
    "the herschel space observatory , to be launched in the near future , will provide important new information on gaseous water in interstellar space and will measure quantitatively the water abundance as a function of temperature , uv field and other parameters .",
    "furthermore , the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ) on herschel will cover the 62 @xmath3 m band of solid h@xmath0o . in this way",
    "herschel will provide a unique opportunity to observe the bulk of the water bands that are unobservable from the ground and relate them to spitzer and groundbased mid - ir observations of ices in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks .",
    "understanding the processes by which water forms and why it is not formed under other circumstances will be essential for the interpretation of these data .",
    "@xcite proposed a reaction scheme in which water ice is formed on the surfaces of grains via three different routes : hydrogenation of o , o@xmath0 , and o@xmath1 .",

    "* e.g. ) . using a monte carlo approach @xcite showed that the contributions of the different formation channels to water ice formation as well as its abundance strongly depend on the local environment .",
    "however , the initial reaction scheme with the corresponding rates as proposed by @xcite is based on old , in some cases outdated , gas phase data of the equivalent reactions .",
    "progress has been severely hampered by the lack of realistic experimental simulations of these low - temperature , solid state reactions .",
    "preliminary laboratory studies of water synthesis testing the first reaction channel have been reported by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "both groups investigated the products of d- and o- reactions on an ice substrate ( n@xmath2o and h@xmath2o , respectively ) using temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) . in experiments exclusively using this technique , it is hard to rule out any h@xmath2o formation during warm up . furthermore , quantitative interpretation can be tricky because unstable species like h@xmath0o@xmath0 are destroyed in the mass spectrometer upon ionization leading to an artificially enhanced h@xmath0o / h@xmath0o@xmath0 ratio .",
    "the present work focuses on the h + o@xmath0 channel in which o@xmath2 is converted to h@xmath2o via h@xmath0o@xmath0 : @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 according to @xcite this channel is , together with the o@xmath1 channel , responsible for water formation in cold , dense clouds .",
    "the exposure of o@xmath2 ice to hydrogen and deuterium atoms is investigated by means of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy ( rairs ) and tpd .",
    "these techniques allow one to determine formation yields and the corresponding reaction rates .",
    "the present work comprises a study of hydrogenation and deuteration reactions of o@xmath2 ice for different temperatures between 12 and 28 k , i.  e.  , up to the desorption temperature of o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the formation of h@xmath0o and h@xmath0o@xmath0 is observed at all temperatures .",
    "an optimum yield is found at 28 k.",
    "experiments are performed using an ultra - high vacuum set - up ( @xmath8 mbar ) which comprises a main chamber and an atomic line unit .",
    "the set - up is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the main chamber contains a gold coated copper substrate ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) that is in thermal contact with the cold finger of a 12 k he cryostat .",
    "the temperature can be varied with 0.5 k precision between 12 and 300 k. a precision leak valve is used to deposit o@xmath2 ( @xmath11 purity , praxair ) on the substrate .",
    "ices are grown at @xmath12 with a flow of @xmath13 mbar s@xmath14 where @xmath15 mbar s@xmath14 corresponds to 1 langmuir ( l ) s@xmath14 . in order to compare results from different experiments ,",
    "the thickness of the o@xmath2 ice is 75 l for all samples studied and the substrate temperature is kept at 15 k during the deposition .",
    "an o@xmath0 ice of 75 l consists of roughly 30 monolayers .",
    "this thickness is chosen to exclude substrate induced effects . because a diatomic homonuclear molecule like o@xmath2 is infrared in - active , gas phase o@xmath2 is monitored during the deposition by a quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) .",
    "after deposition at 15 k the ice is slowly cooled down or heated ( 1 k min@xmath14 ) until a selected temperature is reached .",
    "systematic studies are performed for different temperatures between 12 and 28 k.    h(d)-atoms are produced in a well characterized thermal - cracking device @xcite .",
    "a second precision leak valve is used to admit h@xmath2 ( d@xmath2 ) molecules ( @xmath16 purity , praxair ) into the gas cracking line . in each experiment",
    "the h + h@xmath2 ( d + d@xmath2 ) flow through the capillary in the atomic line is @xmath17 mbar s@xmath14 and the temperature of the heated tungsten filament , which surrounds the gas cracking pipe , is about 2300 k. the dissociation rate and the atomic flux depend on the pressure and temperature @xcite and are kept constant during all the experiments .",
    "a nose - shaped quartz pipe is placed along the path of the atomic beam in order to cool down h(d)-atoms to room temperature before reaching the ice sample by collisions @xcite .",
    "the h(d)-atomic flux nearby the sample is estimated , within 50 % , as @xmath18 @xmath19 s@xmath14 . at temperatures of",
    "12 k and higher , no blocking of surface processes by the presence of h@xmath2 is expected in the ice .",
    "the newly formed species after hydrogenation ( deuteration ) of o@xmath2 ice are monitored by rairs using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( ftir ) running at a spectral resolution of 4 cm@xmath14 in the range between 4000 and 700 cm@xmath14 ( @xmath21 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "typically the ice is exposed to the h ( or d ) beam for 3 ( or 2 ) hours and ir spectra are acquired every few minutes .",
    "systematic control experiments have been performed in order _ ( i ) _ to unambiguously confirm that the products are formed by surface processes and not by gas phase reactions , _ ( ii ) _ to check that any water present in the system does not affect the final results and _ ( iii ) _ to verify that water and h@xmath0o@xmath0 formation occurs in the solid phase after h(d)-atom bombardment and not by h@xmath2(d@xmath2)-molecules addition . for _ ( i ) _ co - deposition experiments are undertaken in which h and o@xmath0 are deposited simultaneously .",
    "water is only formed if the surface temperature is below the desorption temperature of oxygen , confirming that the presence of the oxygen ice is required for this reaction sequence to occur .",
    "( ii ) _ is verified by using inert initial substrates like n@xmath0 ice to estimate the background water contribution , as well as by using different isotopologues ( @xmath22o@xmath0 , @xmath23n@xmath0 and d ) . finally _",
    "( iii ) _ is checked by using pure h@xmath2(d@xmath2)-beams , i.  e.  without any h(d ) present .",
    "the formation of both h@xmath0o@xmath0 and h@xmath0o ice is confirmed by the appearance of their infrared solid state spectral signatures .",
    "figure [ spectra ] shows typical rairs results for hydrogenation and deuteration of o@xmath0 ice at 25 k. from top to bottom a time sequence of four spectra is plotted .",
    "these spectra are difference spectra with respect to the inital oxygen ice . however",
    ", since our initial oxygen ice only consists of 30 ml , no features due to the intrisically very weak o@xmath0 feature @xcite are observed in the original spectrum .",
    "both the h@xmath0o and h@xmath0o@xmath0 clearly grow in time as the h - fluence ( h - flux @xmath24 time ) increases .",
    "similar features appear for the deuteration experiment , although here clearly less d@xmath0o is formed .",
    "after fitting the infrared spectra with a straight baseline the column density ( molecules @xmath19 ) of the newly formed species in the ice is calculated from the integrated intensity of the infrared bands using a modified lambert - beers equation @xcite . in the range of our spectrometer ,",
    "water ice has two candidate bands for determining its column density , at 3430 cm@xmath14 and 1650 cm@xmath14 ( 3 and 6 @xmath3 m , respectively ) . since the strong 3430 cm@xmath14 feature overlaps with the 3250 cm@xmath14 band of h@xmath0o@xmath0 , the weak feature at 1650 cm@xmath14 was chosen to quantify the water column density .",
    "since literature values of transmission band strengths can not be used in reflection measurements , an apparent absorption strength is obtained from a calibration experiment in which a pure water ice layer desorbs at constant temperature until the sub - monolayer regime @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the band strengths remains within a factor of two .",
    "quantification of h@xmath0o@xmath0 is done using the 1350 cm@xmath14 band .",
    "as it is experimentally very hard to deposit pure h@xmath0o@xmath0 ice , the apparent absorption strength has to be obtained indirectly by assuming the ratio of the integrated band strengths between the two bands in transmittance to be the same as in reflectance h@xmath0o",
    "/ h@xmath0o@xmath0 = 0.57 @xcite .",
    "the band modes of solid d@xmath2o and d@xmath2o@xmath2 ices have systematic peak position shifts of @xmath25400 cm@xmath14 with respect to the h@xmath2o and h@xmath2o@xmath2 bands .",
    "the column density for deuterated species is obtained in a similar way from a calibration experiment , while the absorption strength for d@xmath2o@xmath2 is estimated assuming that h@xmath0o / h@xmath0o@xmath0 = d@xmath0o / d@xmath0o@xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "[ nh2o ] the column densities of water and h@xmath0o@xmath0 are plotted as a function of the h - fluence ( atoms @xmath19 ) for different substrate temperatures .",
    "figure [ nd2o ] gives the equivalent for the deuterated species .",
    "the results for h@xmath0o@xmath0 and d@xmath0o@xmath0 are found to be very reproducible ( errors within the symbols ) . due to their low column densities",
    "the relative errors for h@xmath0o and especially d@xmath0o are larger .",
    "the h@xmath0o@xmath0 and d@xmath0o@xmath0 results all show the same initial linear increase followed by a very sharp transition to a steady state column density , with the steady state value increasing with temperature .",
    "the water results show similar behavior although the transition is not as sharp and the temperature dependence of the steady - state value is not as clear .",
    "the observation that the results for all temperatures show the same initial slope means that the rate of the reaction to h@xmath0o@xmath0 is temperature independent .",
    "the final yield is however temperature dependent and this depends on the penetration depth of the hydrogen atoms into the o@xmath0 ices ; at higher temperatures h - atoms can penetrate deeper .",
    "this is discussed in more detail later .    during the preparation of this manuscript we received a preprint by @xcite who performed a similar experiment for one single temperature ( 10 k ) .",
    "our results for 12 k turn out to be close to their results , apart from an absolute scaling due to different assumptions on the band strengths .",
    "reaction rates are obtained by fitting a set of differential equations to the time evolution curves of h@xmath2o ( d@xmath2o ) and h@xmath2o@xmath2 ( d@xmath2o@xmath2 ) .",
    "usually a diffusive mechanism is considered to construct these equations . for h@xmath0o@xmath0 that is formed from oxygen and converted into water as given in eqs .",
    "[ h+o2->ho2]-[h+oh->h2o ] the rate equation would be @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 the hopping rate and column density of species x and @xmath29 and @xmath30 the rate constants of reactions 1 and 3 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite applied similar expressions to determine the rates of the formation of methanol and water , respectively .",
    "they solved these equations under the assumption that the atomic hydrogen abundance on the surface remains constant . in this way expressions for the surface abundances of the reaction products",
    "were obtained with only the effective reaction rates as fitting parameter @xmath31 with @xmath32    fitting this expression to the experimental data points in figs .",
    "[ nh2o ] and [ nd2o ] gives a very poor agreement because the model has an exponential behavior whereas the experiments for several temperature values clearly do not .",
    "this would moreover result in a different rate for h + o@xmath0 for each temperature whereas the experimental curves show that the rate is independent of temperature .",
    "for this reason we decided to use a different model .",
    "we consider two regimes . in the first regime ( @xmath33 )",
    "the hydrogen atoms get trapped into the ice with an efficiency that is independent of temperature . once an atom is trapped it can diffuse efficiently and find an oxygen molecule to react with .",
    "this results in a zeroth order rate .",
    "once nearly all oxygen molecules within the penetration depth are converted to h@xmath0o@xmath0 ( @xmath34 ) , diffusion becomes rate limiting and a diffusive mechanism for the reaction to h@xmath0o@xmath0 and h@xmath0o is applied .",
    "since now the ice is changed from an o@xmath0 ice to an h@xmath0o@xmath0 ice the penetration depth of the h - atoms into the ice will change as well .",
    "this model is described by the following set of equations @xmath35 for @xmath33 and @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ( p_{\\rm{o}_2}-p_{\\rm{h}_2\\rm{o}_2}-n_{\\rm{h}_2\\rm{o}_2}(t_t))(1-\\exp(-\\beta_1(t - t_t)))\\nonumber \\\\ & + & n_{\\rm{h}_2\\rm{o}_2}(t_t)\\\\ n_{\\rm{h}_2\\rm{o } } & = &   n_{\\rm{h}_2\\rm{o}}(t_t ) + ( p_{\\rm{h}_2\\rm{o}_2}-n_{\\rm{h}_2\\rm{o}}(t_t ) ) \\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left(1+\\frac{\\beta_3\\exp(-\\beta_1(t - t_t ) ) - \\beta_1\\exp(-\\beta_3(t - t_t))}{\\beta_1-\\beta_3}\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath34 with @xmath37 the penetration depth of h - atoms into ice x in units of column density , @xmath38 and @xmath39 the effective rates of reaction 1 and @xmath40 the rate of reaction 3 .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath40 represent effective diffusive rates that include both the diffusion rate and the reaction rate , whereas @xmath39 is mainly determined by the hydrogen flux times the efficiency of h trapping into the ice .",
    "fitting this model to the data , the three rates are found to be independent of temperature .",
    "we therefore apply the same average rate to describe the results at all temperatures and only the two penetration depths are allowed to vary between the experiments .",
    "the resulting curves are indicated by the solid lines in figs .",
    "[ nh2o ] and [ nd2o ] .",
    "the obtained rates are given in table [ para ] .",
    "the penetration depths are the steady state values in figs .",
    "[ nh2o ] and [ nd2o ] .",
    "these clearly increase with temperature to very high values .",
    "this suggests that as the o@xmath0 ice reaches its desorption temperature ( @xmath2530 k ) the structure becomes more open and the o@xmath0 molecules more mobile , allowing the hydrogen atoms to penetrate deeply into the ice .",
    "the h@xmath0o@xmath0 structure on the contrary is much more dense and rigid and consequently the h / d - atoms can not penetrate more than a few monolayers even at the highest temperatures .",
    "the temperature effect is also much less prominent in cases where the ice is comfortably below its desorption temperature .    a clear difference in penetration depth between the hydrogenation and deuteration experiments can be observed . for the oxygen penetration depth",
    "a difference of a factor of two is found whereas for hydrogen and deuterium peroxide the difference can be even as high as a factor of six .    like in the models by @xcite and @xcite , the rates @xmath38 and @xmath40 are the products between the rates of the reactions and the hydrogen surface abundance .",
    "the latter is assumed to be constant during the experiment and is the overall result of accretion , desorption and reaction with both h and o@xmath0 .",
    "a comparison of @xmath39 and @xmath38 indicates that the reaction with h only plays a minor role .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath38 and @xmath40 are mainly determined by the fit and are within 50% .",
    "the error in @xmath39 due to the fit is much less , but here the main uncertainty is determined by the layer thickness .",
    "the error in the calibration of the layer thickness is a factor of two . assuming that every hydrogen atom that gets trapped reacts with o@xmath0 and considering that two hydrogen atoms are needed to convert o@xmath0 to h@xmath0o@xmath0 , the trapping efficiency can be determined from @xmath39 and the flux ( @xmath18 @xmath19 s@xmath14 ) .",
    "this results in a trapping efficiency of @xmath2510% for deuterium and @xmath4120% for atomic hydrogen .",
    "this is very close to the sticking efficiency of hydrogen atoms to a water ice surface of @xmath2530% under these circumstances @xcite .",
    "the high efficiency of reaction 1 is consistent with recent theoretical studies of this reaction in the gas phase . @xcite and @xcite found that this reaction can proceed barrierless for certain incoming angles .",
    "the rates @xmath38 and @xmath40 have very similar values .",
    "this suggests that also reaction 3 is very efficient and h@xmath0o formation is only limited by the penetration depth of h@xmath0o@xmath0 .",
    "the rate of reaction [ h+h2o2->h2o+oh ] shows no significant isotope effect .",
    "this is in contrast with the results by @xcite who found a significant isotope effect for this reaction using the diffusive model to fit their 10 k results .",
    "if a large barrier is involved in reaction [ h+h2o2->h2o+oh ] , barrier crossing would proceed via tunneling and an isotope effect is expected ( watanabe , private communications ) .",
    "the fact that we do not observe a ( large ) effect at 12 - 28 k either suggests that the barrier for this reaction is low or that other mechanisms for the formation of water should be taken into account in the model to fit the data . in a future paper we plan to address this question in more detail . for",
    "now the conclusion remains that the formation of water from o@xmath0 and h is very efficient .",
    "the hydrogenation and deuteration experiments presented in this letter show an efficient mechanism to convert o@xmath0 ice to h@xmath0o@xmath0 and ultimately h@xmath0o . in the model that describes these experiments , the rate limiting steps for formation are the trapping of the hydrogen into the o@xmath0 ice and the penetration depth of the hydrogen into the h@xmath0o@xmath0 .",
    "astrochemical models take reaction , diffusion and desorption barriers as input .",
    "our data shows that the formation of at least h@xmath0o@xmath0 proceeds via a reaction with a barrier that is much lower than the value of 1200 k previously assumed by @xcite .",
    "it should therefore be considered as a route for water formation on interstellar grain surfaces .",
    "care should however be taken when extending these findings from a laboratory environment directly to interstellar ices .",
    "the temperature independence of the reaction rate that is observed , for instance , is directly due to the unique property of the o@xmath0 ice that allows hydrogen to penetrate its structure and thereby preventing desorption back into the gas phase . in interstellar clouds",
    "the mantle surfaces would not consist of pure o@xmath0 ice but of a mixture of different species with water as its main constituent @xcite .",
    "the structure of these `` dirty '' ices and the binding energies to it would govern the desorption and diffusion behavior of adsorbates like o@xmath0 and h. experiments on the binding of atomic hydrogen on water ice surfaces showed that the surface abundance is generally dependent on temperature @xcite .",
    "also hydrogenation experiments of co showed that the decreasing h coverage for increasing temperature results in lower effective rates @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the implications of the present work to two different interstellar environments : hydrogenation of an apolar ( water - poor ) ice mantle after freeze - out and cold cloud conditions where ice is formed from direct deposition of h and o.    observations show that interstellar ice mantles consist of polar ( water - rich ) and apolar ( water - poor ) layers @xcite .",
    "apolar ices are thought to form during freeze - out in the densest parts of the cloud . in dense gas ,",
    "most of the atomic oxygen has converted to o@xmath0 which can become subsequently a constituent of this polar phase .",
    "the lack of observed h@xmath0o@xmath0 and h@xmath0o means that most of the o@xmath0 in the ice does not react to produce h@xmath0o@xmath0 or h@xmath0o .",
    "this laboratory work however shows that hydrogen atoms can penetrate deeply into o@xmath0 ices and then react . in apolar interstellar ices the penetration depth",
    "is not determined by oxygen ice but by the main constituent of the ice mantle , co. we therefore have performed additional laboratory experiments in which a mixture of co and o@xmath0 ice is exposed to h - atoms .",
    "these show indeed that only the top few layers are hydrogenated and that the main part of the ice stays intact in agreement with the observations .",
    "details of these experiments are to be published in a future paper .    in cold and translucent clouds h- and o - atoms deposit onto the grain simultaneously .",
    "the species can then react immediately and o@xmath0 is converted all the way to water . here",
    "the penetration depth observed in the laboratory becomes unimportant .",
    "what can we learn from the present experiments then ?",
    "the fast reaction kinetics justify treating h + o@xmath0 and h + ho@xmath0 in a similar way as h + h are treated in astrochemical models , with the difference that probably only hydrogen is mobile for reaction .",
    "the results further suggest that the continuing reactions leading to water proceed with high efficiency .",
    "the original grain surface network by @xcite includes two more water formation routes : via oh and via ozone . under dense cloud conditions",
    "the ozone route was proposed to be the most efficient as is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "this figure plots the contributions for the three different h@xmath0o formation channels using a reaction network limited to the three water formation routes and without any dissociation reactions .",
    "the model parameters are taken from model m1 by @xcite and the initial conditions from @xcite are used ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath19 ) .",
    "these calculations include a barrier for reactions 1 and 3 .",
    "the present work shows that these barriers are negligible and the middle panel plots the same model calculation without these barriers .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the o@xmath0 channel has a major contribution to the overall water formation rate .",
    "recent laboratory experiments by @xcite on the temperature - dependent formation of ozone by irradiation of oxygen ices by high energy electrons suggest that mobile oxygen atoms prefer the o + o pathway over o + o@xmath0 even though the o / o@xmath0 ratio in the ice is very small .",
    "this implies the presence of a barrier for the formation of ozone .",
    "the right panel gives the model results when a small barrier of 500 k for this reaction is considered .",
    "the contribution of the ozone channel is now further reduced .",
    "figure [ model ] further shows the h@xmath0o@xmath0 abundance , @xmath45(h@xmath0o@xmath0 ) , for all models as produced through the o@xmath0 + h route .",
    "@xcite set an observational constraint of the h@xmath0o@xmath0 ice abundance toward of 5.2% with respect to the h@xmath0o ice abundance .",
