    "a fundamental question in the study of galaxy formation and evolution is : what is the chemical evolutionary history of galaxies ?",
    "while some information pertaining to the general question of galactic chemical evolution has been obtained from studies of stellar populations and the interstellar medium in the milky way and in nearby external galaxies , _ direct _ observations of the chemical evolution of galaxies in the early universe has been lacking .",
    "the situation changed when it was recognized that the narrow absorption lines in the spectra of high - redshift quasars can be used to probe conditions in the early universe .",
    "one of the most important developments along this direction has been the recognition of `` damped ly@xmath0 absorption systems '' as a significant population of quasar absorbers and the subsequent systematic studies of their basic properties , which demonstrate that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are likely to be the progenitors of present - day galaxies ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ; wolfe 1995 ; lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 ) .    the pioneering work by meyer , welty , & york ( 1989 ) and by pettini , boksenberg , & hunstead ( 1990 ) clearly demonstrated that one can extract significant information on the abundances of chemical elements in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies through the analysis of the absorption lines in quasar spectra .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) conducted the first systematic survey of elemental abundances in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies , though , for practical reasons , the study was limited to the elements zn and cr .",
    "nonetheless , their study revealed the important fact that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are generally metal poor ( mean ( zn / h)@xmath10 solar ) , confirming that these are young galaxies in the early stages of chemical enrichment .",
    "it was also noted that the element of cr is generally less abundant than zn relative to their solar proportion .",
    "since zn and cr are thought to be made in solar proportions throughout the milky way based on their abundances in galactic disk and halo stars ( see discussion in  4.3 ) , the overabundance of zn relative to cr found in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies was taken as evidence that some cr was depleted from the gas phase by dust grains .",
    "the large collecting power of the 10 m keck telescope has made it feasible to study elemental abundances in damped ly@xmath0 systems in much more detail ( wolfe et al .",
    "1994 ; lu et al .",
    "the improvements come in three facets .",
    "the first is the higher spectral resolution ( fwhm@xmath11 km s@xmath12 ) , which allows one to see more component structure in the absorption . the second is the much improved s / n of the spectra , which makes it considerably easier to study the weak absorption lines .",
    "weak absorption lines are crucial for the determination of elemental abundances since they do not suffer nearly as much as the strong lines from line saturation .",
    "the third has to do with the large spectral coverage of the keck high resolution spectrometer ( hires ) , which enables the study of many elements simultaneously .",
    "this is important because the relative abundances of elements contain valuable information about the nature of the stellar nucleosynthesis that made these elements ( cf .",
    "wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 ) .    for a number of years",
    ", we have been collecting high quality spectra of quasars using the keck hires in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the various absorption phenomena .",
    "one particular aspect of this program is the study of elemental abundances in damped ly@xmath0 systems and their implications for galactic chemical evolution and for stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "some preliminary results of this nature have been reported in lu , sargent , & barlow ( 1995a ) .",
    "the current paper presents the full analyses .",
    "the results described here supersede the earlier results reported in lu et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "in  2 we describe the observations , data reduction , and the methods used to estimate equivalent widths and column densities .",
    "abundance determinations for the 14 damped ly@xmath0 systems studied here are discussed in  3 .",
    "these abundance measurements are combined with similar measurements in the literature to study the chemical evolution of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies over the redshift range @xmath4 (  4 ) . in  5 we discuss other observed properties of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies and implications for their nature .",
    "the redshift dependence of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background as estimated from the c ii * @xmath131335 fine structure line is discussed in  6 .",
    " 7 summarizes the main conclusions .    throughout this study",
    ", we will assume @xmath14 and @xmath15 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "we will use @xmath16 for general references of redshift , @xmath17 for the emission redshift of quasars , @xmath18 for the redshift of damped ly@xmath0 systems , and @xmath19 for any other absorption systems or for absorption systems in general .",
    "table 1 gives the journal of the keck hires observations .",
    "a 0.86 \" slit width was used in all cases to yield a resolution of fwhm=6.6 km s@xmath12 with roughly 3 pixels per resolution element .",
    "the echelle format of hires is such that one can only get complete coverage of the free spectral range for @xmath20   in a single setup with the current tek 2048x2048 ccd . except in a few cases , we used two partially overlapping setups for each wavelength region in order to get complete spectral coverage .",
    "data reductions were done using a software written by t. a. barlow . after the echelle orders were optimally extracted and wavelength- and flux - calibrated , they were resampled to 2 pixels per resolution element , scaled to the same flux level , and added together weighted according to their s / n . because some spectral regions have more exposures than others due to the overlapping - setup scheme , the s / n of the spectrum from even a single object can show quite large variations from one region to another .",
    "most metal lines associated with damped ly@xmath0 systems are blended with ly@xmath0 absorption lines if they occur in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "thus our analyses will primarily rely on measurements made redward of the ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "we estimate the continuum level redward of the ly@xmath0 emission by fitting cubic splines to regions deemed free of absorption lines using the iraf task _ continuum_. in rare cases , we may also use measurements made in the ly@xmath0 forest if the lines are reasonably clean . in such cases ,",
    "the continuum level is estimated by picking out small `` peaky '' regions in the spectral region of interest that are free of obvious absorption lines and interpolating them with low - order cubic splines .",
    "the resulting continuum appears to describe the data quite well",
    ".      for each damped ly@xmath0 system studied here , we give a table listing the absorption lines detected , the measured equivalent widths , and column densities ( see  3 ) .    to carry out the measurements for a given damped ly@xmath0 system , we first plot the continuum - normalized profiles of the absorption lines in velocity space for an adopted redshift for the system ( which generally corresponds to the strongest component in the low ion absorption ) .",
    "equivalent width for each line is then estimated by integrating the observed spectrum over the width of the absorption line defined by two limiting velocities : @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the 1@xmath23 uncertainty associated with the measured equivalent width",
    "is also calculated including both the effects of statistical noise and of uncertainties in the placement of the continuum level ( cf .",
    "savage et al .",
    "1993 ) . only features over the 4@xmath23 significance level will be considered a real detection .    to obtain column densities",
    ", we use the apparent optical depth method ( cf . savage & sembach 1991 ) .",
    "we first convert the normalized absorption line profiles , @xmath24 , into measures of the apparent optical depth per unit velocity , @xmath25 , through the relation @xmath26ln[@xmath27 ) ] , which can then be converted into the apparent column density per unit velocity , @xmath28 , in units of atoms @xmath3 ( km s@xmath12)@xmath12 through the relation @xmath29 where @xmath13 is the rest wavelength in   and @xmath30 is the oscillator strength .",
    "the total column density , obtained by integrating @xmath28 over the width of the absorption profile , should represent the true column density to within the measurement uncertainty if the absorption line contains no unresolved , saturated components . in the case that the absorption line does contain unresolved , saturated components , the integrated @xmath28 only gives a lower limit to the true column density . for an ion species for which",
    "several absorption lines with different @xmath31 values are observed , comparisons of their integrated @xmath28 will generally allow one to infer if unresolved saturated components are present .",
    "this is because lines with larger @xmath31 values will yield lower integrated column densities than lines with smaller @xmath31 values in such cases .",
    "this technique was explored in details by savage & sembach ( 1991 ) .",
    "examples of applications may be found in lu et al .",
    "( 1995b ) .",
    "empirically , we find that , given the spectral resolution and s / n typical of the data used in this work , absorption lines with peak absorption depth less than @xmath32% ( i.e. , peak optical depth @xmath33 if the lines are resolved ) show no evidence of unresolved saturation that would render invalid the column densities derived from @xmath28 integrations . for example , the fe ii @xmath342249 , 2260 lines differ in their @xmath31 values by a factor of 1.3 , and they yield the same @xmath1(fe ii ) for several systems in q 0449@xmath351326 , q 0450@xmath351312 , and q 0454 + 0356 even though the intrinsically stronger @xmath132260 absorption lines are 60 - 75% deep . similarly , the si ii @xmath341304 , 1526 absorption lines , which differ by a factor of 1.5 in their @xmath31 values , yield consistent @xmath1(si ii ) in several systems in q 1946 + 7658 , q 2212@xmath351626 , and q 1202@xmath350725 ( lu et al .",
    "1996a ) even though the intrinsically stronger @xmath131526 absorption lines are 70 - 85% deep . also , the s ii @xmath341250 , 1253 lines ( which differ in their @xmath31 values by a factor of 2 ) in the @xmath36 system toward q 0528@xmath352505 yield consistent column densities despite the fact that the intrinsically stronger @xmath131253 absorption is 85% deep . the most dramatic example is offered by the @xmath37 system toward q 1425 + 6039 ,",
    "where the fe ii @xmath341608 , 1611 absorption lines , which differ in their @xmath31 values by a factor of 62 , yield @xmath1(fe ii ) values differing by less than 0.1 dex , and the @xmath131608 absorption line is 80% deep .",
    "similar examples may be found for the more ionized species such as al iii , si iv , and c iv , each having doublet absorption lines differing in their @xmath31 values by a factor of 2 .",
    "in fact , we have yet to find an example where an absorption line with peak absorption depth @xmath38% shows convincing evidence of being saturated and unresolved .",
    "thus , for ion species for which only a single absorption line is observed ( i.e. , for which we can not check independently if there is any unresolved saturation in the absorption ) , we will assume that the column density derived from integrating its @xmath28 profile is unbiased with respect to unresolved saturation if its peak absorption depth is less than 80% . in reality , most of the single absorption lines studied here are @xmath39% deep , corresponding to a peak optical depth of 0.7 if the lines are resolved .",
    "the only single absorption lines with peak absorption depth between 50 to 80% for which we have adopted their @xmath28-integrated column density as real measurements ( rather than lower limits ) are the si ii @xmath131808 lines at @xmath36 toward q 0528@xmath352505 and at @xmath40 toward q 2237@xmath350608 , the fe ii @xmath131608 line at @xmath37 toward q 1425 + 6039 , and al ii @xmath131670 lines at @xmath41 toward q 1946 + 7658 and at @xmath40 toward q 2237@xmath350608 ( see  3 for details ) .",
    "we emphasize that , for unsaturated or mildly saturated lines , the apparent optical depth method will yield column density measurements in agreement with the profile fitting technique .",
    "for heavily saturated lines , neither method will yield very reliable column densities in practice .",
    "for this reason , the analyses in this paper will concentrate on column density measurements made from unsaturated lines .",
    "column density _ limits _ from saturated lines may be used occasionally in the discussion . for lines that are undetected or detected at significance level less than 4@xmath23",
    ", we will use the 4@xmath23 upper limits of the equivalent width to estimate the upper limits of the column density assuming linear part of the curve of growth .",
    "atomic data , including rest - frame vacuum wavelength , oscillator strength ( @xmath30-value ) , and radiation damping constant , are taken from morton ( 1991 ) except for those which have revised @xmath30-values as given in the compilation of tripp , lu , & savage ( 1996 ; see savage & sembach 1996 for additional information ) .",
    "in this section , we derive column densities and elemental abundances for each individual damped ly@xmath0 system studied here . in general , absorption lines occurring in the ly@xmath0 forest will not be discussed unless the line is relatively clean of contamination from forest absorption .",
    "it will be assumed that the ionization state of the absorbing gas is dominated by species appropriate for h i gas ( e.g. , o i ,",
    "n i , c ii , si ii , fe ii , etc . ) so that abundance corrections for unobserved ionization stages are negligible .",
    "this is believed to be a good assumption given the large h i column density of the systems ( see viegas 1995 ) .",
    "two damped ly@xmath0 systems not covered by the spectra listed in table 1 will also be discussed .",
    "these are the @xmath42 system toward q 0450@xmath351312 , and the @xmath43 system toward q 0454 + 0356 .",
    "keck hires observations of these two quasars were made by drs .",
    "christopher churchill and steven vogt , who have kindly made their spectra available to us .",
    "details of the observations and reductions for these two objects are discussed in churchill & vogt ( 1997 ) .",
    "this damped ly@xmath0 system has been known ever since the quasar was first discovered by c. hazard ( unpublished ; but see webb et al .",
    "it is one of the four damped ly@xmath0 galaxies at @xmath7 for which abundance information has been obtained .",

    "the only additional information obtained for this system is the mn abundance .",
    "we detect over 30 metal lines from 15 different species in this system , partially because the damped ly@xmath0 system has a redshift slightly higher than the emission redshift of the quasar ( @xmath72 ) , so more metal lines than usual are shifted out of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "even though our spectrum covers most of the damped ly@xmath0 absorption line , the coverage to the blue side of the damped ly@xmath0 absorption is too short to reliably assess the continuum level before the damped ly@xmath0 absorption .",

    "the presumed close proximity of the background quasar , which is an intense source of ionizing photons , may have significant effect on the physical state of the absorbing gas in the damped ly@xmath0 galaxy .",
    "secondly , this is the only damped ly@xmath0 system for which molecular hydrogen absorption has been detected ( foltz et al .",
    "1988 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ) .",
    "thirdly , the metal absorption lines are unusually wide and complex , spreading over 600 km s@xmath12 in the strongest low ion lines and 500 km s@xmath12 in the high ion lines .",
    "it appears that the absorption consists of two groups of components at above and below 140 km s@xmath12 , respectively ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the complexity of the metal line absorption may be caused by two galaxies in superposition .",
    "the si ii @xmath131808 absorption is relatively strong ( about 70% deep ) and might be somewhat saturated .",
    "however , the comparably strong s ii @xmath131253 absorption does not appear to show any unresolved saturation based on a comparison of the @xmath1(s ii ) column densities derived from this line and from the weaker @xmath131250 line ( table 8) .",
    "we will therefore assume that the @xmath1(si ii ) derived from the @xmath131808 absorption is correct .    of particular interest",
    "is the c ii * @xmath131335 absorption .",
    "the ratio of @xmath1(c ii*)/@xmath1(c ii ) is a density indicator (  5 ) .",

    "one peculiarity about this system is that the o i @xmath131302 absorption clearly does not reach zero flux in its line center , which is unusual for this normally - strong absorption line .",
    "the o i absorption occurs on top of the strong ly@xmath0 emission line of this quasar .",

    "we consider two possible causes of this residual flux : resolution smearing and ionization effects .    if the o i absorption consists of many extremely narrow components that are not resolvable at our resolution ( fwhm=6.6 km s@xmath12 ) , smearing of the components due to the inadequate resolution could lift the flux in the absorption line center above the zero level even if the absorption components are intrinsically saturated .",
    "this requires the components to have @xmath126 km s@xmath12 or temperature @xmath127 k. experiments show that , indeed , one can explain the residual flux in the o i absorption line center if it contains several appropriately spaced components narrower than @xmath128 km s@xmath12 .",

    "this o abundance is nearly 0.5 dex below the si abundance ( [ si / h]=@xmath130 ) in the same system , which is inconsistent with nucleosynthesis considerations ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "one can reconcile this difference if the si abundance in this system has been overestimated because some of the si ii ions come from partially ionized gas rather than from neutral gas .",
    "if this is the case , it would mean substantial ionization corrections for this system .",
    "however , we consider this explanation unlikely for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , when there are significant ionization corrections , usually there are notable differences in the absorption profiles between o i and other ions that can exist in h ii regions ( e.g. , c ii , si ii , etc . ; see the @xmath41 system toward q 1946 + 7658 in  3.10 ) .",
    "in contrast , the o i absorption in the q 2212@xmath352616 system has identical velocity structure to the c ii and si ii absorption in the system . secondly , the upper limit on the temperature of the microwave background radiation at the redshift of this absorption system as derived from the c ii*/cii ratio (  6 ) is extremely close to the big bang prediction , indicating that collisional excitation of the c ii atoms by free electrons is negligible in the absorbing gas .",
    "this is in contradiction with the large electron density expected in this system if the absorbing gas is substantially ionized .",
    "these considerations suggest that the resolution - smearing interpretation given in the preceding paragraph is likely the correct explanation .",
    "in fact , the implied low electron density in this system from the c ii*/cii ratio (  6 ) suggests that this system may be _ less _ ionized than typical damped ly@xmath0 systems , which in turn may imply a lower temperature and hence narrower line widths ( see the preceding paragraph ) .",
    "our keck spectrum does not cover the damped ly@xmath0 line .",
    "lu & wolfe ( 1994 ) estimated log @xmath1(h i)=@xmath132 for this system , which we adopt .",
    "the metal lines are shown in figure 19 and listed in table 14 .",
    "metal lines detected in the ly@xmath0 forest include si ii @xmath131526 , c ii @xmath131334 , si iv @xmath341393,1402 , and c iv @xmath341548,1550 , but they all appear to be contaminated by forest absorption . the fe ii @xmath131608 absorption yields a log @xmath1(fe ii)@xmath133 from integrating the apparent optical depth profile . given its strength , it is probably saturated . thus we take the above value as lower limit . the absence of the fe ii @xmath131611 absorption yields an 4@xmath23 upper limit of log @xmath1(fe ii)@xmath134 .",

    "the conversion between age ( starting from the big bang ) and redshift assumes @xmath14 and @xmath143 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , which gives a current age of the universe of 16.6 gyrs , consistent with the stellar age determinations .    as is clear from figure 22 , the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies have fe - metallicities in the range of 1/10 to 1/300 solar , or [ fe / h ] between @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "hence they represent a population of young galaxies that are still in the early stages of their chemical evolution .",
    "in fact , as we argue in  4.3 , the star formation process in most of these galaxies probably started less than 1 billion years before the epoch corresponding to their redshift .",
    "the @xmath1(h i)-weighted mean metallicity of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies between @xmath5 is [ fe / h]=@xmath146 , which may be regarded as the cosmic metallicity at @xmath147 .",
    "it is important to note that the true fe abundances of damped ly@xmath0 systems could be systematically higher than those indicated in figure 22 if significant depletion of fe onto dust grains has occurred .",
    "however , as we argue in  4.3 , the amount of fe depletion in the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies in our sample is probably negligible , and should be on average no more than 0.4 dex .",
    "hence modest depletion of fe will not change the qualitative picture presented in this work .      as already noted by pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the chemical enrichment processes in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies appear quite inhomogeneous .",
    "for example , the [ zn / h ] distribution in the sample of damped systems studied by pettini et al .",
    "spans at least a factor of 20 or 1.3 dex .",
    "the [ fe / h ] in our sample at @xmath148 spans roughly the same range .",
    "a metallicity gradient similar to those found in the milky way and in local spiral disks can only account for a factor of @xmath1372 spread in the observed metallicities of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies ( pettini et al .",
    "1994 ) . if all galaxies in the sample formed at roughly the same time , then the large spread in [ fe / h ] may indicate widely different star formation histories in these galaxies .",
    "however , we consider it more likely that the large metallicity spread is due to the different formation epoch of the sample galaxies and/or that the sample contains a heterogeneous mix of galaxy types .",
    "steidel ( 1995 ) found that galaxies responsible for the mgii absorption systems at @xmath149 in quasar spectra come with a variety of morphological types , colors , and luminosities .",
    "this may explain the large metallicity spread in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies if they sample the same parent population of galaxies .",
    "we point out that varying amounts of fe depletion due to dust grains are unlikely to account for the bulk of metallicity spread since [ zn / h ] shows similar spread ( pettini et al .",
    "1994 ) , and zn is not expected to be depleted heavily by dust grains ( see discussion in  4.3 ) .",
    "there is evidence in figure 22 that the mean metallicity of the sample increases with time .",
    "this is perhaps not unexpected , but nonetheless reaffirms the notion that heavy metals gradually build up with time in galaxies through successive generations of star formation .",
    "there was a hint of such a trend in earlier studies ( pettini et al .",
    "1995b ) , but the trend is made much clearer here by the addition of several new measurements at @xmath7 and by the fact that most of our data points are actual measurements rather than upper limits ( as is the case in pettini et al .",
    "1995 ) . in particular , all four of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies at @xmath7 have [ fe / h]@xmath151 ( or , [ fe / h]@xmath152 if we use the 2@xmath23 upper limit for the q2212@xmath351626 system ) . in comparison , many of the galaxies at @xmath5 have reached ten times higher metallicity .",
    "thus the time around @xmath153 could be the epoch of galaxy formation in the sense that it signifies the onset of significant star formation in galaxies .",
    "several other lines of evidence appear to point to the same conclusion , as we discuss below .",
    "the first such evidence comes from the space density distribution of quasars .",
    "it is found that the space density of quasars peaks at @xmath5 and starts to decline at @xmath7 ( schmidt , schneider , & gunn 1995 ; warren , hewett , & osmer 1994 ) .",
    "by @xmath154 , the space density of quasars has dropped by a factor of 7 compared to their peak density at @xmath155 ( kennefick , djorgovski , & de carvalho 1995 ) . if this drop in quasar space density at @xmath7 signifies the early phase of structure formation from the highest density peaks of the primordial fluctuation , it is perhaps `` natural '' to expect galaxy formation and subsequent star formation to occur at slightly lower redshifts .",
    "the second supporting evidence comes from studies of the neutral gas content in damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "previous studies found that @xmath156 , the cosmological density contained in the h i gas in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies , decreases from @xmath153 to @xmath157 , which was interpreted to indicate the transformation of gas into stars ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; wolfe et al . 1996 ; but also see pei & fall 1995 ) .",
    "recent extension of such studies to even higher redshift reveals that @xmath156 declines rapidly at @xmath7 ( storrie - lombardi & wolfe 1996 ) . this may indicate that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are still forming at @xmath7 .",
    "the third supporting evidence comes from the morphology of high redshift galaxies .",
    "hst images of @xmath7 galaxies identified from their redshifted lyman continuum break ( steidel , pettini , & hamilton 1996a ; steidel et al .",
    "1996b ; giavalisco , steidel , & macchetto 1996 ) reveal morphological structures that could be interpreted to indicate star formation in the spheroidal component of massive galaxies .",
    "even if none of these arguments is convincing by itself , taken together , they do consistently point to a picture that galaxies started forming at @xmath16 around or slightly higher than 3 .",
    "finally , it may be significant that the lowest fe - metallicity we find for the sample of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is about @xmath158 , which , coincidentally , also represents the lowest metallicity found for galactic globular clusters .",
    "recent observations of extremely low metallicity halo stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath159 ) reveal that the galaxy underwent a distinct phase of nucleosynthesis before reaching [ fe / h]@xmath160 , characterized by some unusual elemental abundance ratios and large variations ( mcwilliams et al .",
    "1995 ; ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ) .",
    "possibly , this marks a time before which the chemical composition of the gas is only affected by a few type ii supernovae ( audouze & silk 1995 ) , namely , the epoch of formation of the first generation stars .",
    "more studies of @xmath7 damped ly@xmath0 galaxies may eventually reveal such systems ( i.e. , [ fe / h]@xmath159 ) , which would provide unambiguous evidence for the initial formation of galaxies .",
    "we note from figure 22 that the degree of chemical enrichment in the sample of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is , on average , considerably lower than the milky way disk at any given time in the past .",
    "this may bear significantly on the nature of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "it was initially suggested ( cf .",
    "wolfe 1988 ) that the damped ly@xmath0 absorbers may trace disks or proto - disks of high - redshift spirals .",
    "but the low metallicities of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies cast some doubts on this interpretation .",
    "a thick disk similar to that of our own galaxy also appears to be inconsistent with the observed abundance distribution in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies , since the mean metallicity of stars in the thick disk is around [ fe / h]=@xmath161 with a range of @xmath162 to 0 ( cf .",
    "pardi , ferrini , & matteucci 1995 ) .",
    "however , beers & sommer - larsen ( 1995 ) suggested that the [ fe / h ] distribution of thick disk stars probably extends to as low as @xmath163 .",
    "since existing studies of thick - disk stars are still limited to within a few kpc of the disk , the known metallicity distribution may be biased toward higher values .",
    "thus a thick - disk interpretation of the damped ly@xmath0 abundances remains viable , especially in light of the ( somewhat preliminary ) evidence that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies exhibit kinematics expected of rotating structures ( wolfe 1995 ) .",
    "detailed accounts of the properties of the thick disk of the milky way may be found in majewski ( 1993 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies have metallicities resembling those found for galactic halo stars and globular clusters . coincidentally",
    ", the range of [ fe / h ] spanned by the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies at @xmath164 is nearly identical to that spanned by galactic globular clusters .",
    "this suggests the interesting possibility that damped ly@xmath0 absorbers may represent a phase when the spheroidal component of high - redshift galaxies is being formed .",
    "such a possibility has , in fact , been suggested previously based on different arguments ( lanzetta et al . 1995 ; wolfe 1995 ) .",
    "the fe - abundance distribution of damped systems is also consistent with that of old stellar populations in local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( cf . da costa 1992 ) .",
    "dwarf spheroidals contain old to intermediate age stellar populations but with little gas , and the metallicity distributions of their stellar populations indicate episodic star formation in their history .",
    "presumably , most or all of them contained interstellar gas in their remote past that would be sufficient to produce damped ly@xmath0 absorption lines .",
    "the more gas - rich dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , lmc and smc ) also appear to contain old and sometimes intermediate age stellar populations , in addition to young stellar populations indicating ongoing or recent star formation .",
    "the metallicities of the old stellar populations in these galaxies are also similar to those seen in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "these considerations suggest that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies may represent gas - rich dwarf galaxies or sub - galactic fragments which are still collecting themselves to form more massive galaxies .",
    "more discussion about the nature of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies may be found in  5 .      in figure 23",
    "we show the abundance ratios of si , s , zn , cr , mn , and ni to fe plotted against [ fe / h ] . again , except for the [ cr / fe ] panel , the cr abundance has been used in place of the fe abundance when the latter is not available .",
    "this is justified because all the ly@xmath0 galaxies for which we have both fe and cr measurements indicate [ cr / h]@xmath137[fe / h ] : @xmath141[cr / fe]@xmath165 . the dispersion in [ cr / fe ] is consistent with the typical measurement uncertainty of @xmath1370.1 dex .",
    "most of the abundance limits for c , n , o , and al in table 16 are not strong enough to constrain the origin of these elements , so they will only be considered in special cases .    in principle , elemental abundance ratios allow one to infer what kind of nucleosynthetic processes may be responsible for the enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "they are important for constraining models of stellar nucleosynthesis and the shape of the imf .",
    "this is because different elements have different nucleosynthetic origins and different enrichment time scales .",
    "for example , essentially all the oxygen in the galaxy and much of the observable @xmath0-process elements ( including si , s , ca and ti ) are produced by massive stars ( @xmath166 ) through explosive nuclear burning during type ii sn explosions ( cf .",
    "wheeler et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the corresponding time scale is very short : @xmath167 yrs .",
    "in contrast , most of the fe - peak elements ( including v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni , and possibly the lighter elements sc and ti , and the heavier elements cu and zn ) are believed to be produced by type ia sn ( cf .",
    "wheeler et al . 1989 ) , which evolve from low to intermediate mass stars ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "thus the time scale for producing the bulk of fe - group elements should be at least as long as the lifetime of the progenitor stars of type ia sn , which is @xmath169 yrs , and is possibly much longer depending on the uncertain time scale between the formation of the white dwarf and the ignition of sn ia explosion .",
    "for example , yoshii , tsujimoto , & nomoto ( 1996 ) deduced an `` effective '' lifetime of @xmath170 gyrs for type ia sn progenitors based on the analysis of galactic stellar abundance data .",
    "the same low - to - intermediate mass stars also make much of the solar n ( and possibly c ) through mass losses on comparable time scales .",
    "hence the production of c , n , and fe - group elements is expected to lag behind that of o and @xmath0-group elements following an episode of star formation .",
    "however , in the case of elemental abundances derived from gas phase absorption , one also needs to worry about the additional effect of dust depletion if a significant amount of dust exists in these damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "refractory elements such as si , mn , fe , cr , ni , etc . are preferentially incorporated into dust grains , which depletes their abundances in the gas phase . that different elements deplete in different amounts",
    "significantly modifies the relative abundances of these elements in the gas phase .    in order to distinguish between the effects of nucleosynthetic processes and dust depletion",
    ", we compare the abundance ratios observed in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies with those seen in galactic disk and halo stars , and with those determined for diffuse galactic ism clouds .",
    "the former serves to illustrate the effects of nucleosynthesis at different stages of chemical evolution of the milky way , while the latter illustrates the effects of dust depletion .",
    "granted , there is no guarantee that any of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies would have the same chemical enrichment history as the milky way , or that the dust grains in these high - redshift galaxies would have properties similar to galactic dust , but these comparisons should nevertheless be useful in providing some general guidance .",
    "figure 24 shows the abundance ratios in diffuse ism clouds in both the galactic disk and halo from table 17 .",
    "reviews of this subject may be found in jenkins ( 1987 ) and savage & sembach ( 1996 ) .",
    "since it is believed that the intrinsic elemental abundances of the local interstellar medium are solar , the spread in [ fe / h ] ( the horizontal axis in figure 24 ) represents different levels of dust depletion in the clouds rather than variations in the intrinsic metallicity of the clouds ( as is the case for figure 23 ) .",
    "the departure of the observed elemental abundances in ism clouds from the solar mixture is generally considered to be caused by condensation of refractory elements into solid forms ( grains ) . in the diffuse galactic ism , fe , cr , and ni are among the most heavily depleted elements ; si and mn are somewhat less depleted ; while zn , s and c , n , o are nearly unaffected by dust depletion ( jenkins 1987 ) .",
    "these depletion characteristics show up clearly in figure 24 . comparing figure 23 and figure 24 ,",
    "one finds good agreement in the [ cr / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] ratios .",
    "the [ si / fe ] , [ s / fe ] and [ zn / fe ] ratios in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are consistent with the effects of dust depletion ( figure 24 ) in the _ direction _ of the deviations from the solar ratios , but the _ amounts _ of deviations are much less in the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies . this may be explained if the dust - to - gas ratio in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is lower than the galactic value or the mean gas density in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is lower ; the latter follows from the fact that the degree of elemental depletion is observed to correlate with the mean gas density along the line of sight in the milky way ( see the review in jenkins 1987 ) .",
    "however , the mn / fe ratio found for damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is completely opposite to what is expected from the dust depletion effect .",
    "another strong piece of evidence against a dust depletion interpretation of the observed abundance ratios in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is their n / o ratio ( see below ) .",
    "the n i @xmath341199.55 , 1200.22 , 1200.71 triplet occurs in the ly@xmath0 forest so it is generally not possible to make reliable measurements of their column densities .",
    "however , in two damped ly@xmath0 systems ( see table 16 ) , the clear absence of n i absorption and the presence of saturated o i absorption provide firm upper limits on their [ n / o ] ratio of @xmath114 and @xmath171 dex , respectively .",
    "stronger limits can be found for [ n / si ] : @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we found @xmath83[n / si]@xmath84 for several components in the @xmath36 system toward q 0528@xmath352505 ( see  3.7 ) . since both si and o are believed to come from massive stars , and indeed , are observed to have solar abundance ratio in galactic halo stars ( cf .",
    "wheeler et al . 1989 ) and in metal - poor dwarf galaxies ( thuan , izotov , & lipovetsky 1995 ) , it is probably safe to assume that [ si / o]=0 in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "we then find n / o at least a factor of 3.3 to 20 times _ lower _ than the solar ratio in these damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .    the abundances of n and o in ism clouds have been measured toward many sightlines using the _ copernicus _ satellite by york et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , whose data were reanalyzed by hibbert , dufton , & keenan ( 1985 ) and by keenan , hibbert , & dufton ( 1985 ) using improved @xmath30-values .",
    "similar determinations have been made for a few clouds using the ghrs on board the hst ( cardelli , savage , & ebbets 1991 ) . since these measurements were made using the extremely weak intersystem transition lines of n i ] @xmath131160 and o i ] @xmath131335 rather than the strongly saturated n i @xmath131200 triplet and o i @xmath131302 transition , they do not suffer significantly from the usual saturation problem associated with the strong lines .",
    "their results indicate that the depletion of n and o in diffuse ism clouds is almost always less than 0.3 dex , and in addition , n is usually less depleted than o. hence , it is extremely difficult to explain the observed n / o ratios in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies with dust depletion if the intrinsic n / o ratio is solar .",
    "thus we conclude from the above discussion that dust depletion alone can not explain the abundance ratios observed in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "figure 25 shows the abundance ratios found in galactic disk and halo stars ( see  4.1.2 for references ) .",
    "the overabundance of si to fe relative to the solar ratio in halo stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath174 ) , [ si / fe]@xmath175 , is now well established , and is thought to reflect the yield of these elements from type ii supernovae .",
    "a similar overabundance is seen for s ( figure 25 ) and other @xmath0-elements ( cf .",
    "wheeler et al . 1989 ) .",
    "all the other elements displayed in figure 25 ( cr , mn , fe , ni , zn ) are fe - peak elements .",
    "the fact that the fe - peak elements are believed to be formed under nuclear statistical equilibrium and thus share a common origin may explain why their abundance ratios in the halo stars are so similar to the solar values .",
    "the only exception is mn , with @xmath141[mn / fe]@xmath176 for halo stars .",
    "this `` odd - even '' effect , namely , the relative underabundance of odd - z elements ( where z is the atomic number ) compared to the abundances of even - z elements of the same nucleosynthetic origin , is fairly well established observationally . one theory of why this occurs is that the production of odd - z elements depends on the neutron excess in the nuclear fuel , which in turn depends on the initial metallicity of the stellar composition ( truran & arnett 1971 ) . calculations of explosive nucleosynthesis in metal poor stars by truran & arnett indicate that the yield of both odd - z nuclei and the neutron - rich isotopes of even - z nuclei are significantly reduced relative to more metal - rich stars .",
    "we find remarkable agreement in the si / fe , s / fe , cr / fe , and mn / cr ratios between damped ly@xmath0 galaxies and those seen in galactic stars in the same metallicity range . the difference in ni / fe between figures 23 and 25 may not be real and may have to do with the uncertain @xmath30-values of the ni ii transitions ( cf .",
    "morton 1991 ) . since the stellar abundances are not determined from the same ni ii lines ( the stellar abundances are from ni i lines ) as for the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies , a systematic error in the ni ii @xmath30-values could explain the nearly constant offset of [ ni / fe ] from the zero point in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "this may also explain why the ni / fe ratios in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies more closely resemble those seen in diffuse ism clouds ( figure 24 ) as in both cases the abundances of ni are derived from the same ni ii transitions with the same @xmath30-values .",
    "we consider the ni / fe ratio unsuitable for the purpose of discriminating a nucleosynthetic origin of the damped ly@xmath0 abundances from a dust depletion origin .",
    "more reliable determinations of the ni ii @xmath30-values in the future would make the ni measurements more useful .",
    "we also note that , although in most damped ly@xmath0 systems the al ii @xmath131670 absorption lines are saturated , the al ii absorption in the @xmath41 system toward q 1946 + 7658 and in the @xmath40 system toward q 2237@xmath350608 appears weak enough that the estimated @xmath1(al ii ) s probably do not suffer from significant saturation effects . the ratios , [ al / si]@xmath177 and @xmath178 ( tables 11 and 15 ) , are consistent with observations of galactic halo stars ( cf .",
    "wheeler et al . 1989 ) .",
    "incidentally , al and si are both produced during hydrostatic carbon and neon burning in massive stars , but al is an odd z element .",
    "accordingly , the underabundance of al relative to si is consistent with the odd - even effect .",
    "the only significant difference between figure 23 and figure 25 is in the zn / fe ratio .",
    "a zn / cr overabundance , or equivalently , a zn / fe overabundance ( since [ cr / fe]@xmath1370 in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies ) was known since the first studies of damped ly@xmath0 abundances ( meyer , welty , & york 1989 ; pettini , boksenberg , & hunstead 1990 ) , and was interpretated to indicate that some cr ( and fe ) is depleted by dust grains from the gas phase .",
    "we will have more discussion of this in  4.3.3 .",
    "in general , we consider the good agreement in the si / fe , s / fe , cr / fe , and mn / fe ratios between damped ly@xmath0 galaxies and galactic halo stars strong evidence for a type ii sn enrichment origin of these elements without significant modifications by dust grains .",
    "in particular , the observed mn / fe ratios _ require _ a type ii sn - enrichment explanation since they can not be explained otherwise .",
    "another strong argument for sn ii enrichment in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is the n / o ratios ( see below ) .    in  4.3.1",
    ", we argued that the observed low n / o ratios in several damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are inconsistent with the interpretation of dust depletion . on the other hand ,",
    "these low n / o ratios are very similar to those found in galactic halo stars .",
    "there was some debate about whether [ n / fe ] in halo stars is more close to zero or less than zero ( see discussion in wheeler et al .",
    "but since [ o / fe ] is known to be about + 0.4 dex in halo stars , it is safe to say that [ n / o]@xmath179 dex at [ fe / h]@xmath174 .",
    "similarly , observations of metal - poor ( [ o / h]@xmath174 ) external galaxies indicate [ n / o]@xmath180 ( pagel et al . 1992 ; skillman & kennicutt 1993 ; thuan et al . 1995 ) .",
    "such low n / o ratios are commonly interpreted in terms of the different nucleosynthetic origin of these elements . while o is almost exclusively produced by short - lived massive stars , n is thought to have two sources . for pristine gas or gas with very low metallicity ,",
    "primary n production is made by intermediate mass stars ( @xmath181 ) during the third dredge - up episodes , which bring carbon - rich material from the he - burning shell into the hydrogen - burning shell ( renzini & voli 1981 ) .",
    "the n produced this way is primary because it does not depend on the initial metal content of the gas .",
    "the long evolution time scale of the intermediate mass stars necessarily means that there should be a time delay of several hundreds of million years between the injection of o into the ism and that of primary n. secondary production of n can occur in stars of any mass during main - sequence burning , when the initial metallicity in the star is high enough to provide the seed c and o nuclei .",
    "although the above popular interpretation is challenged by some recent observational results ( cf .",
    "thuan et al .",
    "1995 ) , which suggest that significant amounts of _ primary _ n may be produced by massive stars , it remains true that the _ observed _ n / o ratio in halo stars and in metal - poor external galaxies is low and comparable to that observed in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "we thus believe that the low n / o ratios ( and the low mn / fe ratios ) found for damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are indications that massive stars are the primary pollutants of the ism in these galaxies .",
    "this probably happens because star formation in these galaxies has occurred shortly before they were observed , so that only massive stars have had time to evolve to type ii sn .",
    "given this time scale , we expect to see @xmath0-elements overabundance relative to fe - peak elements .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure 23 .",
    "in fact , the observed overabundances of si to fe and s to fe , and the underabundance of al to si and mn to fe can be entirely explained away with the above nucleosynthesis argument . the only remaining question is : is there a need for dust depletion on top of the nucleosynthesis pattern ?      the preceding discussion demonstrates that dust depletion alone can not explain the observed elemental abundances in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "rather , with the exception of zn , all the observed abundances are nicely explained if type ii supernovae are the only significant sources of pollution in these galaxies .",
    "could the zn / fe ratios , then , be suggesting that there is some dust depletion effect on top of the nucleosynthesis pattern ?    in galactic stars",
    "the zn / fe ratio is found to be solar at all metallicities ( see figure 25 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed zn / fe ratios in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are essentially all above the solar ratio .",
    "since zn is almost unaffected by dust in warm diffuse ism clouds , while fe is among the most heavily depleted elements , a modest amount of fe depletion would explain the observed zn / fe ratios in damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "this was indeed the argument that was put forward previously to explain the observed zn / cr ( equivalent to zn / fe ) ratios ( cf .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "however , this interpretation does not appear to be consistent with the other observed ratios .",
    "for the damped ly@xmath0 systems in which both zn and fe abundances are measured , @xmath141[zn / fe]@xmath182 . in other words , if the above dust - depletion explanation for the observed zn / fe ratios is correct , the gas phase fe abundance in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies must have been on average depleted by about 0.4 dex ( or more if zn is also depleted ) .",
    "to explain the other ratios shown in figure 23 , this requires si , s , cr , mn being depleted by the same amount in order to maintain the expected si / fe , s / fe , cr / fe , and mn / fe ratios from halo star observations and from theories of type ii sn enrichment ( recall that the observed mn / fe and n / o ratios in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies _ require _ that the enrichment process be dominated by sn ii ) .",
    "this is quite difficult to understand given the observed depletion patterns in galactic ism clouds . as discussed in sembach & savage ( 1996 ) , even in warm diffuse halo clouds for which elemental depletion is the least",
    ", there is a differential depletion factor of 0.44 dex between si and fe ( i.e. , fe is more depleted than si by 0.44 dex ) .",
    "the difference in the si and fe depletion widens for cooler , denser clouds .",
    "the problem is especially acute for s since in diffuse ism clouds s is essentially undepleted ( see table 17 ) .",
    "given that fe is among the most heavily depleted elements in the galactic ism , it is difficult to understand how s and fe could have the same depletion , unless the depletion property of dust in the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is drastically different from galactic dust .",
    "however , if the latter is true , then the basis for interpretating the zn / fe ratio to indicate dust depletion may no longer be valid .",
    "the degree to which an element is depleted by dust grains in the galactic ism is known to roughly anticorrelate with its condensation temperature ( field 1974 ; jenkins 1987 ) , which is the temperature at which half of the atoms condenses into solid forms of some sort under thermal equilibrium conditions . to further look into the issue of dust depletion",
    ", we plot the abundances of the elements found in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies as a function of their condensation temperature using the data given in table 16 . rather than plotting the abundance of individual elements for each damped ly@xmath0 galaxy , which would make the figure incomprehensible because of the large scatter , we chose to plot the elemental abundances relative to the fe abundance in the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies in order to see the mean trend .",
    "the result , shown in figure 26 , is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the same relation seen in ism clouds ( cf .",
    "jenkins 1987 ; savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "the most notable difference is in the behaviour of mn and n. the implication is that there is no significant evidence for dust depletion to be the origin of the observed abundance patterns in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "this is in agreement with similar findings for two individual damped ly@xmath0 galaxies previously studied by wolfe ( 1995 ) and by prochaska & wolfe ( 1996 ) .",
    "another way to look for the effect of dust depletion is to examine the variations of elemental abundance ratios among the different velocity components in a given system .",
    "it is well established that the degree of dust depletion in ism clouds generally varies with their locations ( environment ) in the galaxy , with cool , diffuse disk clouds showing much larger depletion than the warm , diffuse halo clouds ( cf . sembach & savage 1996 ) .",
    "such a dependence of depletion on environment probably has to do with the modification or destruction of dust grains by supernova shocks .",
    "if the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies contain dust grains that are affected by similar energetic processes , then one might expect to see large variations in the elemental abundance ratios from one absorbing cloud to another .",
    "the best elements for this test are probably ( s , zn ) and ( cr , fe , ni ) since the two groups of elements are at the two extremes of dust depletion and because they are generally measurable in damped ly@xmath0 systems . in practice , however , such a test is difficult to carry out since one must rely on the weak lines to derive accurate column densities , which require high resolution , high s / n measurements .",
    "prochaska & wolfe ( 1996 ) examined the relative abundances of si , fe , ni , cr , and zn in several components of the @xmath183 damped ly@xmath0 absorption system toward q 0201 + 3634 and concluded that there is little dust present in the absorbing gas .",
    "among all the damped ly@xmath0 systems studied in  3 , we consider the @xmath36 system toward q 0528@xmath352505 the best suited for this purpose since the s ii @xmath131250 , 1253 lines are well measured and we have good measurements for six ni ii lines ( see table 8) . equally important is the fact that these ions are well measured across a @xmath184 km s@xmath12 interval encompassing many components .",
    "the three panels to the left in figure 27 show the profiles of @xmath28 , the column density per unit velocity interval , for s ii and ni ii derived from the average of two s ii lines and of six ni ii lines in the system .",
    "the profile for si ii @xmath131808 is also shown for comparison .",
    "the three panels to the right in figure 27 shows the @xmath28 ratios of these ions . amazingly , the s ii / si ii , s ii / ni ii , and si ii / ni ii ratios are nearly constant over the @xmath185 km / s interval where these ratios are relatively well measured .",
    "given that these ratios can be affected by many factors , including intrinsic relative abundance variations , ionization effects , as well as dust depletion , we find the relative constancy of these ratios quite remarkable . in comparison , the s ii / ni ii",
    "ratio varies from @xmath186 in warm diffuse halo clouds to @xmath187 in cool disk clouds in the milky way ( see sembach & savage 1996 ) .",
    "the above result becomes even more remarkable in light of the fact that the @xmath36 system toward q 0528@xmath352505 is the only damped ly@xmath0 system known to contain molecular hydrogen ( foltz et al .",
    "1988 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ) , which makes it more likely to contain dust .",
    "however , in this damped ly@xmath0 system the fraction of molecular hydrogen relative to neutral hydrogen is well below the galactic value for sightlines with similar values of @xmath1(h i ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we find it difficult to interpret the observed zn / fe ratios ( or zn / cr ratios ) in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies as being a consequence of dust depletion .",
    "to summarize the preceding discussion , we favor the interpretation that the abundance ratios in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are mostly or entirely a consequence of type ii sn nucleosynthesis without significant modification by dust depletion .",
    "the evidence for this conclusion is the much - lower - than - solar n / o ratio , the @xmath0-element overabundance relative to fe peak elements , and the underabundance of mn relative to fe and al relative to si ( odd - even effect ) .",
    "such abundance patterns are , in some sense , expected in the early stages of galactic chemical evolution based on what we know about the milky way ( cf .",
    "timmes , lauroesch , & truran 1995 ) , and were indeed noted previously in individual damped ly@xmath0 systems ( e.g. , lu et al . 1995b ; meyer , lanzetta , & wolfe 1995 ; steidel et al .",
    "1995 ; wolfe 1995 ; pettini et al .",
    "1995a ; lu et al .",
    "1996a ; prochaska & wolfe 1996 ) . the present study , however , puts the above conclusion on much firmer ground .",
    "the zn / fe overabundance found for damped ly@xmath0 galaxies can be explained without invoking dust if there is an additional source of zn ( particularly @xmath188zn , see figure 5 of timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) in sn ii besides that synthesized under nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "such an alternative production mechanism for zn might occur in the neutrino - driven wind discussed by hoffman et al .",
    "one difficulty with this interpretation is that a zn / fe overabundance is not observed during the early history of the milky way ( figure 25 ) . in that regard",
    ", it would be extremely valuable to obtain the zn / fe ratio for some metal - poor stars in external galaxies in order to see if zn / fe is universally solar .",
    "it is perhaps significant that we do not yet have a clear theoretical understanding of why zn should track fe so well in galactic disk and halo stars .",
    "for example , using the type ii sn yield calculations of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , both timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and malaney & chaboyer ( 1996 ) found a much lower - than - solar zn / fe ratio ( by a factor of 3 - 7 ) for plausible assumptions about the stellar initial mass function ( see arnett 1995 for a more in - depth discussion ) .",
    "if indeed the observed zn / fe ratios in damped systems are intrinsic to the nucleosynthetic processes , it will have significant implications for the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis . at this point , we consider zn an anomalous element .",
    "it is important to note that , even if the observed zn / fe ratios are due to dust depletion ( which we consider unlikely ) , the amount of fe depletion should be no higher than 0.4 dex on average , assuming that zn is undepleted .",
    "in other words , the amount of fe locked up in grains should be less than 60% of the total .",
    "this is in contrast to the depletion of fe in ism clouds in which up to more than 99% of the fe may be locked up in grains .",
    "it should also be noted that a 0.4 dex depletion of fe would not explain all the differences between the metallicity distribution of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies and that of the milky way disk stars ( figure 22 ) .",
    "regardless of whether or not dust is present in the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies , the observed n / o ratios and mn / fe ratios strongly indicate a nucleosynthetic origin .",
    "this suggests that the chemical enrichment process in these damped ly@xmath0 galaxies must have occurred so recently prior to when they were observed that only type ii sn have made significant contributions to the pollution of their interstellar material ; low to intermediate mass stars could not have had enough time to evolve and to make their presence known by dumping their nucleosynthetic products into the interstellar space .",
    "hence the star formation process should not have proceeded more than several hundred million years from the time corresponding to their redshifts .",
    "one way to avoid this conclusion is if the stellar initial mass function in these young galaxies had a low mass cutoff so that there simply are nt that many low mass stars to make type ia sn , even if they had enough time to do so .",
    "observations of elemental abundance ratios in lower redshift and more metal - rich damped ly@xmath0 galaxies should help to clarify this issue , since we expect sn ia to catch up eventually .",
    "the issue of dust is critical for a complete and accurate understanding of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "fall and collaborators ( fall & pei 1989 ; fall , pei , & mcmahon 1989 ; pei , fall , & bechtold 1991 ) found marginally significant evidence that quasars with known damped ly@xmath0 galaxies in the foreground are statistically redder than those without .",
    "this was taken as evidence for the presence of a modest amount of dust in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio inferred for the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is roughly 1/10 of that in the galaxy .",
    "however , the observational evidence for this reddening has been challenged recently ( foltz 1996 , private communication ; storrie - lombardi 1996 , private communication ) .",
    "the only other independent evidence for the presence of dust in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies was thought to be the zn / cr or zn / fe ratios ( cf .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "but as we argued earlier , this interpretation has problems explaining many of the other observed abundance ratios .",
    "fall & pei ( 1995 ; also pei & fall 1995 ) argued that most of the more dust - rich galaxies have been missed in existing surveys .",
    "this is because previous surveys for damped ly@xmath0 galaxies were based on quasars selected optically , hence quasars with dusty foreground galaxies would be preferentially missed owing to dust obscuration .",
    "fall & pei ( 1995 ) estimated that up to 70% of the bright quasars at @xmath189 could be missing from optically selected samples . in principle , such a selection effect could occur even if there is no significant amount of dust in the _ existing _ sample of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies",
    ". if this is the case , then the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies studied here will not be representative of all high - redshift galaxies .",
    "in particular , the mean metallicity as given by [ fe / h ] would be biased towards lower values , making them appearing ( on average ) more metal poor than they really are .",
    "the abundance ratios may also be affected .",
    "a critical test of this hypothesis is to conduct a new survey for damped ly@xmath0 galaxies using a sample of high redshift quasars selected from a _ complete _ sample of radio sources regardless of their optical brightness .",
    "such a program is being pursued .",
    "the column density ratio of c ii*/c ii is a density indicator ( bahcall & wolfe 1968 ) . the lower level of the c ii * @xmath131335 transition is a fine structure level of the ground state of the c ii atom . under normal interstellar conditions ,",
    "the population balance between the ground level and the fine structure level of the c ii ground state is determined by collisional excitation with electrons and by spontaneous radiative decay .",

    "these limits are consistent with the mean electron density of @xmath190 @xmath191 estimated for the galactic ism ( cf .",

    ".      the relative strength and velocity distribution of absorption from ion species with different ionization properties can provide insight into the ionization structure and the spatial distribution of the absorbing gas .",
    "table 19 summarizes such information for some ions of interest based on data presented in this paper and other similar studies with keck hires ( see references in the table ) .",
    "we make the following comments :    \\(1 ) in all cases where such information is available , the al iii absorption profiles always have similar appearance as the low ionization lines . additionally , the al ii lines are always much stronger than the al iii lines , indicating @xmath1(al ii)@xmath192(al iii ) .",
    "these results suggest that al iii is likely to be produced in the same physical region as the low ion gas , and that most of the gas is neutral rather than ionized ( as expected from the large h i column densities of the systems ) .",
    "this could happen if al iii comes from an ionized shell surrounding the neutral gas which produces the bulk of low ions .",
    "\\(2 ) the si iv and c iv absorption line profiles almost always resemble each other , and they usually have a very different appearance from the low ion absorption lines .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the high ions are probably produced in physical regions distinct from that containing the low ions .",
    "the high ions could arise from low - density ionized gas ( halo clouds ? ) surrounding the main structure which gives rise to the low ionization species .",
    "the profile differences between low - ion and high - ion absorption lines have been noted previously in individual damped ly@xmath0 systems ( eg .",

    "the current discussion makes these trends much clearer .",
    "the results are reassuring in that , in general , the metal abundances derived from low ionization species without corrections for ionization effects should be substantially correct .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical expectations ( viegas 1995 )      the profiles of metal absorption line in damped ly@xmath0 systems contain information about the kinematics of the gas .",
    "the total velocity spread of the absorption lines may allow one to estimate the mass of the objects if they are caused by random motions of the absorbing clouds confined by gravitational potentials . in practice ,",
    "the velocity spread may be affected by ordered motions ( e.g. , rotation , infall / outflow ) and by energetic events such as supernova explosions .",
    "one needs also to take into account the fact that often the quasar sightlines do not probe the full gravitational potential of the absorbing objects , depending on the impact parameters .",
    "these considerations make it difficult to infer the mass of the absorbing galaxies .    on the other hand , analyses of the profiles of the metal absorption lines",
    "have yielded a potentially very exciting result .",
    "wolfe ( 1995 ; see also lanzetta & bowen 1992 ) found preliminary evidence that the weak low - ionization metal absorption lines in damped ly@xmath0 systems often show an edge - leading asymmetry that is characteristic of absorption from rotating gaseous disks .",
    "it should be pointed out that only weak , unsaturated low - ionization absorption lines can be used to trace reliably the velocity structure of the neutral gas in galactic disks .",
    "strong , saturated absorption lines are not appropriate for this purpose for two reasons : ( 1 ) one loses the information on the velocity structure of the absorption in the saturated part ; ( 2 ) strong absorption lines are more sensitive to trace amounts of gas so they are more easily contaminated by diffuse clouds that are not associated with galactic disks ( e.g. , halo clouds ) .",
    "the implication of wolfe s finding is that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies may be high - redshift spiral disks .",
    "if this conclusion is confirmed with a much larger data set , it will not only provide strong evidence for the physical nature of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies , but will also become one of the most significant constraints on cosmological models of structure formation in the early universe .",
    "data contained in this paper are currently being analyzed by wolfe and collaborators for the purpose discussed above .",
    "the rate and form of star formation and the initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars formed are fundamental parameters for understanding galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the failure to detect ly@xmath0 emission from damped ly@xmath0 galaxies may suggest that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies generally do not have high star formation rates .",
    "for example , lowenthal et al . (",

    "the implied star formation rates are @xmath193 yr@xmath12 for normal imf , assuming negligible extinction by dust . of course",
    ", if a significant amount of dust is present in these galaxies , the true star formation rate could be much higher .",
    "however , the hu et al .",
    "( 1993 ) observations of h@xmath0 emission from three damped ly@xmath0 galaxies limit the star formation rates to less than 20@xmath194 yr@xmath12 in those galaxies .    on the other hand",
    ", the lack of ly@xmath0 emission from a damped ly@xmath0 galaxy does not necessarily mean low star - formation activity , even if there is no significant extinction by dust .",
    "as demonstrated by valls - gabaud ( 1993 ) , the equivalent width of ly@xmath0 emission from a galaxy is a strong function of the age of the stellar population . in the case of a star burst ,",
    "the strength of the ly@xmath0 emission decreases rapidly after the burst , essentially because the massive stars ( o and early b stars ) responsible for the ly@xmath0 emission are short - lived .",
    "his model calculations suggest that the ly@xmath0 photons disappear from the galaxy in @xmath195 years after the burst and the galaxy spectrum will even show stellar absorption in ly@xmath0 at later times .",
    "the case of continuous star formation is qualitatively different , with the galaxy showing relatively strong ly@xmath0 emission ( equivalent width @xmath196  ) at all times because o , b stars are continuously being formed . _",
    "if _ the lack of strong ly@xmath0 emission in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is indicative of the bursting nature of their star formation process , it may have significant implications for their nature .",
    "there is now strong evidence that normal spiral disks tend to have relatively constant star formation during their lifetimes while dwarf galaxies ( dwarf irregulars and dwarf spheroidals ) tend to have bursts of star formation ( cf .",
    "kennicutt 1995 )",
    ". a bursting nature of star formation for damped ly@xmath0 galaxies , _ if established _ , would favor them being dwarf galaxies or subgalactic structures .",
    "the form of star formation in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies may also be inferred from the elemental abundance ratios . in particular",
    ", the relative abundance of o and @xmath0-process elements to those of the fe - group elements is fairly sensitive to the intervals between episodes of star formation , essentially because of the @xmath197 gyr delay between the almost - instantaneous enrichment from sn ii and that from sn ia .",
    "if some of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies in our sample began with a strong burst of star formation which was followed by a long quiescent period , one would expect its si / fe ratio to drop below the sn ii expectation ( i.e. , @xmath1372 - 3 times the solar value ) after @xmath198 gyrs when type ia sn start to inject fe into the ism .",
    "thus a uniform distribution of si / fe ratios may well indicate that the star formation process in these galaxies is relatively uniform .",
    "the existing data ( figure 23 ) does show a fairly uniform si / fe ratio : @xmath141[si / fe]@xmath199 based on 12 measurements ( note that the scatter of 0.11 dex is comparable to the typical measurement uncertainty of 0.1 dex ) .",
    "however , it is premature to make any firm conclusions because of the relatively small number of data points , and because we do nt know when each galaxy was formed .",
    "the age span of the existing sample galaxies with si / fe measurements , @xmath200 gyrs , is probably too small to even make a statistical inference about when these galaxies were formed .",
    "if the uniformity of the si / fe ratio persists to much lower redshifts in a much larger sample , then it may seriously constrain the history of star formation in these galaxies since at least some of the very low - redshift galaxies should have formed much longer than 1 gyrs ago . a smooth star formation process",
    "would be more typical of disk galaxies than dwarfs .",
    "alternatively , a constant si / fe ratio may be maintained by a top - heavy imf .",
    "dust depletion , which is expected to become significant at low enough redshift , may further complicate the issue .",
    "the relative constancy in the si / fe ratio among the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies in the sample also suggests that the imf integrated stellar yields of these elements are fairly uniform .",
    "if the relative yield of @xmath0-elements and fe from type ii sn varies strongly with the progenitor mass , as was suggested in some theoretical calculations ( e.g. , thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 ) , the scatter in the measured si / fe ratio may be used to put significant constraints on the variations of the stellar imf in these galaxies over the range of 10 - 40 @xmath194 ( responsible for sn ii ) .",
    "we did not attempt a quantitative calculation of the imf constraint because all existing models of sn ii suffer from the uncertain nature of the explosion mechanism , which significantly affects the fe yield .",
    "there is direct evidence that at least some damped ly@xmath0 absorption systems may be associated with large , disk - like structures .",
    "briggs et al . ( 1989 ) found that the 21-cm absorption from the @xmath201 damped ly@xmath0 galaxy toward pks 0458@xmath35020 shows striking similarity in the measurements made with the arecibo single dish and with the vlbi .",
    "this requires the absorbing galaxy to cover the entire radio source , which is an extended structure of about 10 kpc size in the absorber s reference frame .",
    "kinematic arguments further suggest that the actual size of the absorber may be several times bigger .",
    "more recently , djorgovski et al . ( 1996 ) identified a galaxy at @xmath202 responsible for a damped ly@xmath0 absorption system in the spectrum of a background quasar .",

    "1994a ) , both the c i and c i * absorption are detected so it was possible to actually measure the excitation temperature rather than providing upper limits .",
    "these results are displayed in figure 28 , where the dotted line is the prediction of @xmath217 from big bang cosmology .",
    "all the existing measurements or upper limits are consistent with the big bang prediction .",
    "we note that , other than the two measurements at @xmath218 ( which are based on c i*/c i ) , the two upper limits at @xmath219 are particularly tight .",
    "this may be partially attributed to the good s / n of the data , but is also due to the fact that at @xmath219 , the peak of the microwave background radiation is shifted to a wavelength region very close to the energy separation ( 158 @xmath220 m ) between the fine structure levels of the c ii ion ground state .",
    "thus the c ii ion is a particularly good probe of the microwave background temperature at very high redshifts .",
    "it is also significant that one of the measurements at @xmath221 and the upper limit at @xmath222 are very close to the big bang predictions , suggesting that contributions from other excitation mechanisms are negligible in these systems .",
    "we have obtained high quality spectra of quasars using the high resolution spectrometer ( hires ) on the 10 m keck telescope in order to study the elemental abundances in 14 high - redshift ( @xmath223 ) damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the hires spectra have a resolution of fwhm=6.6 km s@xmath12 , with a typical s / n@xmath224 per resolution element .",
    "the chemical elements being studied include c , n , o , al , si , s , cr , mn , fe , ni , and zn , although not every element listed is measured for every damped ly@xmath0 galaxy . in order to ensure accuracy , we measure column densities and abundances using only those absorption lines with @xmath71 detection significance that are believed to be unsaturated .",
    "this allows us to circumvent the difficulty associated with measuring reliable column densities using saturated absorption lines . in all other cases ,",
    "we derive abundance limits using either the @xmath225 upper limits ( for weaker or undetected lines ) or the lower limits ( for saturated lines ) on their column densities .",
    "we also use the improved oscillator strengths ( @xmath30-values ) for a number of important transitions as given in the compilation of tripp et al .",
    "these new abundance measurements are combined with similar measurements in the literature that are believed to be largely free of biases resulting from line saturations in order to investigate the chemical evolution of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "where appropriate , we have corrected the earlier measurements with the set of improved @xmath30-values ( tripp et al .",
    "1996 ) so that all the measurements will be on the same footing .",
    "the total sample contains 23 damped ly@xmath0 absorption systems in the redshift range @xmath4 .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies have [ fe / h ] in the range of @xmath145 to @xmath226 , or ( fe / h ) between 1/10 to 1/300 solar , clearly indicating that these are young galaxies in the early stages of chemical evolution .",
    "the @xmath1(h i)-weighted mean metallicity of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies with @xmath5 is [ fe / h]=@xmath146 , which may be regarded as the cosmic metallicity at @xmath147 .",
    "there is a large scatter ( about a factor of 30 ) in ( fe / h ) at @xmath6 , which we argue is real and which probably results from the different formation histories of the absorbing galaxies or a mix of galaxy types .",
    ". comparisons of the distribution of [ fe / h ] vs redshift for the sample of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies with the similar relation for the milky way disk ( i.e. , the galactic age - metallicity relation ) as defined by the stars in the edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) sample indicate that the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are much less metal - enriched than the galactic disk in its past .",
    "since there is evidence from our analyses that depletion of fe by dust grains in the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is unimportant , the difference in the enrichment level between the sample of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies and the milky way disk suggests that the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are probably not high - redshift spiral disks in the traditional sense .",
    "rather , they could represent a thick disk phase of galaxies , or more likely the spheroidal component of galaxies , or dwarf galaxies .",
    "there is evidence that the mean metallicity in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies rises sharply at @xmath227 , possibly indicating the onset of significant star formation and chemical enrichment in early galaxies .",
    "such an epoch may be identified as the epoch of galaxy formation in the sense that galaxies are beginning to form the bulk of their stars .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the drop in the neutral baryon content of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies at @xmath7 ( storrie - lombardi & wolfe 1996 ) , with the sharp decrease in quasar space density at @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "kennefick et al .",
    "1995 ) , and with the morphology of @xmath228 galaxies identified from their lyman continuum break ( steidel et al .",
    "1996a , b ; giavalisco et al .",
    "it would be extremely important to confirm the above results using a much larger statistical sample .",
    "the relative abundance patterns of the elements being studied here closely resemble those seen in galactic halo stars .",
    "this provides ( in our opinion ) unambiguous evidence that the bulk of heavy elements in these high - redshift galaxies were produced by type ii supernovae , with little contribution from stellar mass loss of low - to - intermediate mass stars or from type ia supernovae .",
    "the evidence for type ii supernova enrichment includes the overabundance of o relative to n , the overabundance of @xmath0-elements ( si , s ) relative to the iron peak elements ( cr , mn , fe , ni ) , and the underabundance of mn relative to fe and al relative to si ( i.e. , the odd - even effect ) .    \\5 . in agreement with earlier studies",
    ", we find zn to be overabundant relative to cr or fe by an average of @xmath229 dex compared to their solar values .",
    "although earlier studies have attributed this effect to selective depletion of cr and fe by dust grains , such an interpretation is inconsistent with many of the other elemental abundance ratios seen in these galaxies , most notably n / o and mn / fe .",
    "we find no dependence of the measured elemental abundances on their condensation temperature in a way that would suggest the depletion by dust grains ( cf .",
    "jenkins 1987 ) .",
    "the lack of significant variations in the s / ni ratio across a large velocity interval ( several hundreds of km s@xmath12 ) in one damped ly@xmath0 system also argues against the presence of dust in this galaxy .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the overabundance of zn relative to cr in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies may be intrinsic to their stellar nucleosynthesis . if this interpretation is correct , it will provide important new information to the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "we discuss the physical conditions in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the upper limits on the electron density in the absorbing gas as inferred from the c ii*/c ii ratios are consistent with the value found in the galactic ism .",
    "it is found that the absorption profiles of al iii in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies always resemble those of the low - ionization lines .",
    "the profiles of si iv and c iv absorption , while resembling each other in general , are almost always different from those of the low - ionization absorption lines .",
    "these results suggest that al iii is probably produced in the same physical region as the low - ionization species in the absorbing galaxies , while the high - ionization species ( si iv and c iv ) mostly likely come from different physical regions .",
    "we determine upper limits on the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation at several redshifts using absorption from the fine structure level of the c ii ion ( i.e. , c ii * ) .",
    "these upper limits are consistent with the predicted increase of @xmath9 with redshift .",

    "<S> we study the elemental abundances of c , n , o , al , si , s , cr , mn , fe , ni , and zn in a sample of 14 damped ly@xmath0 systems ( galaxies ) with h i column density @xmath1(h i)@xmath2 @xmath3 , using high quality spectra of quasars obtained with the 10 m keck telescope . </S>",
    "<S> to ensure accuracy , only weak , unsaturated absorption lines are used to derive ion column densities and elemental abundances . combining these abundance measurements with similar measurements in the literature , we investigate the chemical evolution of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies based on a sample of 23 systems in the redshift range @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the main conclusions are as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> \\1 . </S>",
    "<S> the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies have ( fe / h ) in the range of 1/10 to 1/300 solar , clearly indicating that these are young galaxies in the early stages of chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1(h i)-weighted mean metallicity of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies between @xmath5 is ( fe / h)=0.028 solar . </S>",
    "<S> there is a large scatter , about a factor of 30 , in ( fe / h ) at @xmath6 , which we argue probably results from the different formation histories of the absorbing galaxies or a mix of galaxy types .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons of the distribution of ( fe / h ) vs redshift for the sample of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies with the similar relation for the milky way disk indicate that the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are much less metal - enriched than the galactic disk in its past . since there is evidence from our analyses that depletion of fe by dust grains in the sample galaxies is relatively unimportant , the difference in the enrichment level between the sample of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies and the milky way disk suggests that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are probably not high - redshift spiral disks in the traditional sense . </S>",
    "<S> rather , they could represent a thick disk phase of galaxies , or more likely the spheroidal component of galaxies , or dwarf galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> \\3 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean metallicity of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies is found to increase with decreasing redshift , as is expected . </S>",
    "<S> all four of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies at @xmath7 in our sample have ( fe / h ) around 1/100 solar or less . in comparison </S>",
    "<S> , a large fraction of the damped ly@xmath0 galaxies at @xmath6 have reached ten times higher metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the time around @xmath8 may be the epoch of galaxy formation in the sense that galaxies are beginning to form the bulk of their stars . </S>",
    "<S> several other lines of evidence appear to point to the same conclusion , including the evolution of the neutral baryon content of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies , the evolution in the quasar space density , and the morphology of @xmath7 galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> \\4 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative abundance patterns of the elements studied here clearly indicate that the bulk of heavy elements in these high - redshift galaxies were produced by type ii supernovae ; there is little evidence for significant contributions from stellar mass loss of low - to - intermediate mass stars , or from type ia supernovae .    \\5 . </S>",
    "<S> although earlier studies have attributed the overabundance of zn relative to cr or fe found in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies to selective depletion of cr and fe by dust grains , such an interpretation is inconsistent with many of the other elemental abundance ratios seen in these galaxies , most notably n / o and mn / fe . </S>",
    "<S> several other tests also indicate that there is no significant evidence for dust depletion in these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the overabundance of zn relative to cr in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies may be intrinsic to their stellar nucleosynthesis </S>",
    "<S> . if this interpretation is correct , it will provide important new information to the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis .    </S>",
    "<S> \\6 . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption profiles of al iii in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are found to resemble those of the low - ionization lines . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles of si iv and c iv absorption , while resembling each other in general , are almost always different from those of the low - ionization absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that al iii is probably produced in the same physical region as the low - ionization species in the absorbing galaxies , while the high - ionization species ( si iv and c iv ) mostly likely come from distinct physical regions .    </S>",
    "<S> \\7 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible ways to obtain information on the history of star formation ( i.e. , continuous or episodic ) in damped ly@xmath0 galaxies , and on the shapes of the stellar initial mass functions .    </S>",
    "<S> \\8 . </S>",
    "<S> we review the evidence for , and against , the hypothesis that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are disks or proto - disks at high redshifts , and discuss the implications .    </S>",
    "<S> \\9 . </S>",
    "<S> we determine upper limits on the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation at several redshifts using absorption from the fine structure level of the c ii ion . </S>",
    "<S> these upper limits are consistent with the predicted increase of @xmath9 with redshift . </S>"
