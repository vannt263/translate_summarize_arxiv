    "<S> * solar cells incorporating organic - inorganic perovskite , which may be fabricated using low - cost solution - based processing , have witnessed a dramatic rise in efficiencies yet their fundamental photophysical properties are not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton binding energy , central to the charge collection process , has been the subject of considerable controversy due to subtleties in extracting it from conventional linear spectroscopy techniques due to strong broadening tied to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> here we report the simultaneous observation of free and defect - bound excitons in ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 films using four - wave mixing ( fwm ) spectroscopy . due to the high sensitivity of fwm to excitons , tied to their longer coherence decay times than unbound electron - hole pairs </S>",

    "<S> *    the efficiency of solar cells using organometal halide perovskite semiconductor absorber layers has skyrocketed during the past few years , now reaching a level competitive with existing solar cell technologies @xcite while offering a low - cost solution - processed device platform . </S>",
    "<S> this has stimulated intense research into the fundamental photophysical properties of these materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a parameter that has received considerable attention recently is the exciton binding energy ( @xmath1 ) , which determines the primary mechanism of carrier transport during device operation . unlike inorganic solar cell materials such as iii - v semiconductors , in which sharp exciton resonances greatly simplify extraction of @xmath1 , the solution - processed organometal halide perovskites possess substantial broadening due to defects @xcite and intrinsic dynamic disorder associated with the freedom of orientation of methylammonium ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening associated with these effects , which has been found to vary from 30 mev at cryogenic temperatures to 60 mev at room temperature @xcite , is comparable to ( or larger than ) the exciton binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> this broadening complicates the extraction of @xmath1 from absorption or ellipsometry techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , while photoluminescence provides an effective probe of defect - induced localization and recombination processes @xcite , these techniques can not isolate transitions relevant to absorption within an operational solar cell and can be hampered by incomplete phase transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extraction of @xmath1 from magneto absorption techniques is also complicated by the strong broadening in the organometal halide perovskites , resulting in the need to use large magnetic fields ( @xmath260 tesla ) @xcite . due to these challenges , even for the most widely studied material ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 , the value of @xmath1 has been quite controversial , with reports ranging from 2  mev to 55  mev @xcite .    here </S>",

    "<S> measurement of the emitted light versus the detection photon energy and the time delay between the two incident laser pulses provides a wealth of information about the optical transitions within the system under study , including the resonance frequencies and the time scale for scattering processes that cause decay of coherence ( the so - called dephasing time , @xmath7)@xcite . for semiconductors , </S>",
    "<S> fwm is highly sensitive to excitons because the signal at each pulse delay is integrated over the coherence lifetime of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> excitons , being charge - neutral spatially - localized excitations , have much longer @xmath7 times than delocalized free carrier and band tail transitions @xcite . this sensitivity to excitonic effects </S>",
    "<S> has been exploited to observe the fundamental exciton in lt - gaas,@xcite in which the optical band edge is strongly broadened by as@xmath8 antisite defects preventing the observation of any signature of the exciton in linear absorption , as well as the exciton resonance at the spin - orbit split - off band gap in inp @xcite , which is masked in linear spectroscopy by strong degenerate interband transitions associated with the lower - energy band gaps .    </S>",
    "<S> our experiments reveal two discrete resonances below the band gap of the ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 thin films , which we attribute to the free exciton transition and a defect - bound exciton transition . </S>",
    "<S> the simultaneous observation of both free and localized excitons using this absorption - based nonlinear optical technique shows that both types of exciton can contribute to absorption during operation of a solar cell . at 10 k , </S>",
    "<S> the excitonic resonances we observe occur at 1.629  ev and 1.613  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the 16  mev energy separation is attributed to the binding energy of excitons to point defects within the perovskite film @xcite , and is in reasonable agreement with the recent measurement of an exciton localization energy of 17  mev in ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath9cl@xmath10 using photoluminescence and thz techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our measured transition energies correspond to an exciton binding energy of 13 mev ( 29 mev ) for the free ( defect - bound ) exciton at 10  k , with a negligible temperature dependence up to 40  k. the low - temperature free exciton binding energy we measure is in reasonable agreement with the value of 16  mev determined at 2  k from recent magneto - optical studies at high magnetic fields @xcite . together with the difficulty in fully characterizing the dielectric constant including the potential contributions of phonons @xcite and related dispersion @xcite , the close proximity of the free and bound exciton states we observe has likely contributed to the broad range of exciton binding energies reported in the literature @xcite .    the four - wave mixing signal measured on the ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 sample at 10  k </S>",

    "<S> together with the observation of three peaks in the four - wave mixing spectrum , this suggests that there are multiple , distinct contributions to the measured fwm response of the perovskite film .    </S>",

    "<S> the discrete resonance we observe in the fwm signal at 1.613  ev is attributed to an excitonic transition within the ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 film .    </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the magnitude of the fwm signal as the laser pulses are tuned indicates that the resonance feature at 1.613  ev is not the only discrete resonance below the band gap . </S>",

    "<S> the strong 1.629  ev resonance is attributed to the free exciton transition , while the weaker resonance at 1.613  ev is attributed to an exciton bound to defects within the perovskite film . from a comparison of the transition energy of each exciton with the band gap energy , we determine the binding energies of these excitons to be 13  mev and 29  mev , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the free exciton was found to contribute much more strongly than the bound exciton . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy of the free and defect - bound exciton resonances we observe are both within the large spread of reported values of 2 - 55  mev for ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0,@xcite shedding some light on the controversy surrounding @xmath1 in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty in determining the dielectric constant , including both the choice of appropriate spectral range @xcite and the complexity tied to the role of lattice vibrations @xcite , has also contributed substantially to the wide range of reported binding energies since this value is essential to the modeling of absorption and photoluminescence . since the transition energies of the free and defect - bound excitons are determined directly using fwm spectroscopy , the dielectric constant is not required to determine the binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in a recent work by even _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , the dielectric constant was taken as a fitting variable in modeling the linear absorption spectrum , yielding a free exciton binding energy of 13  mev at 80  k , in agreement with the value reported here .    </S>",
    "<S> the separation between the free and defect - bound exciton resonances is 16  mev . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the binding energy of excitons to point defects within the ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 film . </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels tied to a variety of point defects were calculated using density functional theory techniques by yin _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all point defects with low formation energies were found to be shallow defects , with energies less than 50  mev away from the band extrema . </S>",
    "<S> the reported transition energies in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggest that the dominant donor ma@xmath12 may be responsible for exciton localization at low temperatures in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the small 16  mev binding energy of these defects is consistent with a similar coherence decay time observed for the free and defect - bound excitons in our experiments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 ) , which is a signature of weak localization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are also in line with an exciton localization energy of 17  mev determined from photoluminescence and thz studies on ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath9cl@xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> static disorder associated with the frozen methylammonium cations at low temperatures @xcite may contribute to inhomogeneous broadening of the exciton resonances , which is reflected by the measured linewidths being @xmath115 times larger than the homogeneous width estimated from the duration of the coherent emission .    </S>",
    "<S> multiple emission peaks have also been observed in photoluminescence experiments on single crystals of ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 @xcite , however the energy separation between the emitting exciton resonances was considerably larger than that found using fwm techniques in this work . </S>",
    "<S> as fwm detects the states participating in absorption , this suggests that carriers relax into deeper energy levels prior to radiative recombination . </S>",
    "<S> our observations , which verify the existence of weakly localized exciton states in this system , are in agreement with recent power - dependent photoluminescence studies which determined that excitons recombine radiatively from trap states @xcite and transient photoconductivity experiments that indicated a resonant transition below the band gap tied to localized states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are also consistent with earlier four - wave mixing experiments in disordered iii - v superlattices revealing simultaneous signatures of free excitons and excitons bound to neutral carbon acceptors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the application of coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy to ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 reported here complements and extends the numerous studies of this system using linear optical techniques in recent years , for which the substantial broadening inherent to the disordered organic inorganic perovskite materials obscures fundamental photophysical properties such as excitonic effects , leading to challenges in assessing crucial parameters for solar cell design . </S>",
    "<S> since fwm preferentially detects optical species possessing long coherence decay times , this technique is highly sensitive to excitonic transitions , a feature that has been exploited for studying excitons in clean and disordered iii - v and ii - vi semiconductors over more than two decades @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the direct observation of the resonance energies of both free and defect - bound excitons in ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 , eliminating the need to rely on assumed values of the dielectric constant for determination of the associated binding energies , aids in clarifying the broad range of values of the exciton binding energy reported in recent years as the relative role of free and defect - bound excitons will vary depending on whether absorption or photoluminescence based detection schemes are utilized . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of defect - bound excitons using a technique based on nonlinear absorption indicates that both free and localized exciton species play a role in an operational solar cell . </S>",
    "<S> our findings demonstrate the power of fwm spectroscopy for studying excitonic properties and the influence of disorder in the organometal halide perovskite class of semiconductors , and will aid in improving solar cell device performance using this material system . </S>"
