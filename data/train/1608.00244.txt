    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration of the universe  @xcite has added a new challenge for fundamental theories of physics and cosmology .",
    "observations  @xcite show that the kind of matter of which stars and galaxies are made forms less than @xmath12 of the universe s total mass .",
    "several independent observations indicate that about @xmath13 of the total energy density of the universe is in the form of a mysterious dark energy or gravitationally repulsive energy , and about @xmath14 is in the form of non - baryonic cold dark matter particles which clump gravitationally , but which have never been directly detected .",
    "the late acceleration of the universe is often attributed to the presence of one of the most weird and mysterious stuffs termed _ dark energy _ in the cosmic fluid .",
    "but understanding the nature of this dark energy is definitely one of the most challenging theoretical problems facing present - day cosmology and people embark on looking out for different plausible alternatives with missionary zeal . for sparing the readers going through the repetition of those arguments and its counterparts ( for excellent reviews in this field one",
    "is referred to for instance  @xcite ) we skip the details and mention that different variants of chaplygin gas are also serious contenders for the same .",
    "incidentally many workers in this field strongly feel that it is not enough to keep on generalizing the original chaplygin gas by introducing new parameters to the theory without much physical basis and then manipulate the arbitrary parameters at will to explain the observational results coming from different cosmic probes but one should also concentrate on basic physics involved . returning to the multiplicity of arbitrary constants for greater maneuverability",
    "one should also check that the different forms of the chaplygin gas should behave as a closed thermodynamical system . in this context , among many other things the question of its stability is of utmost importance and we are primarily motivated by the consideration if the well known stability criteria may put some stringent conditions on the values of the parameters of the system . in the process",
    "we find that some of the claims made by past workers are clearly ruled out when posited against the stability criteria .",
    "with this in mind we have in the past worked on the stability problem in some of our works  @xcite and this one also deals with this specific problem in the case of variable modified chaplygin gas .",
    "a chaplygin type of gas cosmology  @xcite is one of the plausible explanations of recent phenomena , which is a new matter field to simulate dark energy .",
    "this type of equation of state(eos ) is not applicable in the case of primordial universe   @xcite .",
    "such equation of state leads to a component which behaves as dust at early stage and as cosmological constant ( @xmath9 ) at later stage .",
    "the form of the equation of state ( eos ) of matter is the following ,    @xmath15    here @xmath16 corresponds to the pressure of the fluid and @xmath17 is the energy density of that fluid and @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "recently a variable generalised chaplygin gas ( vgcg ) model is proposed and constrained using union supernovae sample and barion acoustic oscillation ( bao )  @xcite assuming the @xmath18 to depend on scale factor of frw metric .",
    "now we have taken the above relation as @xmath1 where @xmath3 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath2 an absolute constant .",
    "@xmath4 is the volume of the fluid . for @xmath8 the vgcg equation of state",
    "reduces to the generalised chaplygin gas equation of state  @xcite . in the above",
    "mentioned work of lu they got @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "later lu et al  @xcite studied the same case with @xmath21 ( vcg ) with the help of supernovae union and bao data .",
    "the best fit values of model parameters are found to be @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly if sne ia union data is only considered , they obtained @xmath23 . again",
    "sethi _ et al _",
    "@xcite showed that for @xmath24 the best fit values of @xmath3 lie in the interval @xmath25 [ _ wmap 1st peak + sne ia(3@xmath26 _ ) ] and @xmath27 [ _ wmap 3rd peak + sne ia(3@xmath26 _ ) ] .",
    "so from what has been discussed above we see that the value of @xmath3 may be both positive or negative .",
    "positive value of @xmath3 gives a quiescence type of evolution and big rip is avoided while the negative value of @xmath3 favors a phantom - like chaplygin gas model which allows for the possibility of the dark energy density increasing with time .",
    "relevant to mention that recently there are some indications that a strongly negative equation of state , @xmath28 , may give a better fit  @xcite with observations .",
    "literature abounds with work where different forms of chaplygin gas were taken as dark energy model and tried to fit the different findings of the cosmological probes .",
    "but it is not enough to be able to match the observational data .",
    "but the thermodynamical viability of the fluid should also be seriously explored . in this context stability of the fluid",
    "is crucially important .",
    "previously santos et al  @xcite have studied and showed that the generalised chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model is thermodynamically stable . the present work is motivated by the consideration if the variable generalised chaplygin gas ( vgcg ) is also thermodynamically viable . in the process",
    "we find the thermodynamical stability criteria are satisfied subject to the condition that @xmath3 should be negative definite which apparently contradicts lu s  @xcite conclusion for vgcg model . but @xmath21 , the negative value of @xmath3 lies within the range obtained by sethi et al  @xcite and also agreed with another work of lu et al  @xcite where they have considered sn ia union data only . + following usual thermodynamical procedure we have derived expressions of different thermal quantities as functions of temperature and volume .",
    "we also find that the third law of thermodynamics is satisfied in the case of vgcg . in the cosmological context",
    ", we have also found that vgcg is also amenable to a unified picture of dark matter and energy which cools down as the universe expands .",
    "finally , the paper ends with a brief discussion .",
    "one may take @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath4 are the internal energy and volume filled by the fluid respectively .",
    "now , we try to find out the energy @xmath30 and pressure @xmath16 of variable generalised chaplygin gas ( vgcg ) as a function of its entropy @xmath31 and volume @xmath4 . from thermodynamics , one has the following relationship @xmath32 with the help of equations , and    @xmath33    integrating ,    @xmath34^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}.\\ ] ]    where the parameter @xmath35 is the integration function , which may either be a function of entropy @xmath31 only or a universal constant .",

    "now the energy density @xmath17 of    the vgcg comes out to be    @xmath40^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } }   \\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{v}\\right)^n\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } } .\\ ] ]    in what follows we shall try to obtain the expressions of relevant physical quantities and investigate their behaviour .",
    "it is to be mentioned that we get exactly similar expression for density from energy conservation equation with the scale factor given by @xmath41 .",
    "using equations and the pressure @xmath16 of the vgcg may also be determined as a function of entropy @xmath31 and volume @xmath4 in the following form    @xmath42^{\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}.\\ ] ]     and @xmath4 for different values of @xmath3 with @xmath43 , @xmath24 & @xmath44 . _",
    "[ 1 ] , width=302 ]    the equation gives a very general expression of pressure where we see that @xmath16 is always negative .",
    "for @xmath45 the equation becomes @xmath46 which reduces to an earlier work of santos et al  @xcite for the generalised chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model .",
    "again for @xmath47 in equation , we get @xmath48^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] which is identical with our previous work  @xcite when we consider the variable chaplygin gas ( vcg ) model . + now using expressions and we get the _ effective _ equation of state parameter @xmath49     @xmath50 @xmath4 graph for different values of @xmath3 with @xmath51 , @xmath24 & @xmath44 . _",
    "[ 2 ] , width=302 ]    due to its complexity , we can not arrive at definite conclusions from equation , which forces us to look forward to its extreme cases : for small volume , @xmath52 , the equation gives    @xmath53    interestingly we see that for this dust dominated universe , the @xmath3 has essentially no influence on the pressure @xmath16 . again for large volume , @xmath54 ,",
    "the equation becomes    @xmath55    since @xmath56 .",
    "three possibilities exist for @xmath57 depending on the signature of @xmath3 as ( i ) @xmath58 , @xmath59 , which points to a quiescence type of evolution and big rip is avoided in this case , ( ii ) @xmath8 , @xmath60 .",
    "it represents @xmath9cdm and ( iii ) @xmath10 , @xmath61 gives a phantom like universe .",
    "this is compatible with recent observational results  @xcite .",
    "influence of @xmath3 is prominent in this case .",
    "+ now we calculate the deceleration parameter of the vgcg fluid from equation as @xmath62     and @xmath4 for different values of @xmath3 with @xmath43 , @xmath24 & @xmath44 . _",
    "[ 3 ] , width=302 ]    as the equation is very involved in nature we again look for extremal cases as before . for @xmath52 , we get    @xmath63    _ i.e. _ , universe decelerates for small @xmath4 .",
    "alternatively for @xmath54 , the equation reduces to    @xmath64    to sum up when volume is very small there is no influence of @xmath3 on @xmath65 , here @xmath66 , universe decelerates .",
    "but for large volume , @xmath67 and this depends on the value of @xmath3 also . for _ flip _ in deceleration parameter",

    "it follows that for @xmath68 to have real value @xmath71 , otherwise _ flip _ does not occur .",
    "this also follows from the fig - 3 where only @xmath72 allows _ flip _ ( for @xmath73 .",

    "thus for decelerates @xmath74 and for acceleration @xmath75 .",
    "+ if @xmath76 be the velocity of sound equation gives    @xmath77    the equation offers some interesting possibilities : this gives @xmath78 at dust dominated universe and for large volume we get @xmath79    we shall presently see that from the thermodynamical stability conditions @xmath3 becomes negative , leading to a phantom type of universe  @xcite .",
    "moreover the equation gives an imaginary speed of sound for @xmath80 , leading to a perturbative cosmology .",
    "one need not be too sceptic about it because it favours structure formation   @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to make some comparison with a recent work of myong  @xcite where holographic dark energy , chaplygin gas and tachyon model with constant potential are briefly discussed _ vis - a - vis _ their implications as regards squared acoustic speeds .",
    "this is all the more relevant because signature of the squared speeds is a key factor in determining the stability criteria .",
    "it is observed that the squared speed of tachyonic field and chaplygin gas are always positive while if the condition of future event horizon is assumed _ apriori _ as the ir cut off but for holographic dark energy it is always negative definite .",
    "at this stage one may check the thermodynamic stability conditions of a fluid during its evolution . for this",
    "it is necessary to find if _ (",

    "now we have discussed some special cases as follows :    \\(i ) a cursory glance at the equation shows that @xmath3 and @xmath90 can not be at once zero because that makes @xmath91 leading to a severe restriction on the stability of the fluid . in this case",
    "the pressure becomes constant through any adiabatic change of volume .",
    "moreover @xmath2 here behaves like a cosmological constant and consequently we get a de - sitter type of metric for late universe .",
    "when @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",

    "[ fig : subfigureexample ]    it is clear from equation that for @xmath80 , @xmath3 should be negative for @xmath85 throughout the evolution .",

    "but there is another work of lu  @xcite where the union sne ia data and sloan digital sky survey(sdss ) baryon acoustic peak to constrain the variable generalised chaplygin gas ( vgcg ) model is studied and the best fit values of @xmath103 for @xmath20 are obtained . from what has been discussed above",
    "we see that lu s conclusion about the positivity of @xmath3 is inadmissible when confronted with thermodynamical stability criteria .",

    "next the temperature @xmath106 of the variable modified chaplygin gas as a function of volume @xmath4 and entropy @xmath31 may be determined from the relation @xmath107 . as we have considered @xmath108 to be an absolute constant , the equation gives    @xmath109^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}\\left ( \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial s } \\right)_{v }    .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have previously seen that @xmath35 may be a either universal constant or function of entropy @xmath31 .",
    "if we consider @xmath35 to be an absolute constant @xmath106 becomes zero for all values of volume and pressure and it makes the stability criteria questionable .",

    "we have no _ a priori _ knowledge of the functional dependence of @xmath35 . from physical considerations , however , we know that this function must be such as to give positive temperature and cooling along an adiabatic expansion and so we choose that @xmath111 .    in the literature  @xcite",
    "santos et al have considered jacobian identity to calculate the expression of @xmath35 for the case of modified chaplygin gas , where they assumed that @xmath112 .",

    "again for @xmath8 , we get the identical expression of @xmath7 found by santos et al  @xcite .    to end the section a final remark may be in order .",
    "positivity _ of specific heat is strongly desirable _ vis - a - vis _ when dealing with special relativity , in a recent communication luongo _",
    "@xcite argued that in a frw type of model like the one we are discussing a negative specific heat at constant volume and a vanishingly small specific heat at constant pressure @xmath127 are also compatible with observational data .",

    "further we see that for @xmath8 the above expression goes to an earlier work of santos et al  @xcite .",
    "with the help of equations and we get the thermal eos parameter of vgcg as    @xmath133    here thermal eos parameter is a function of temperature only . in the early era of the universe when temperature is very high , _",
