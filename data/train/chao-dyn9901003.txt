    "period - doubling transition to chaos has been extensively studied in a one - parameter family of one - dimensional ( 1d ) unimodal maps , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a state variable at a discrete time @xmath2 . as the control parameter @xmath3",
    "is increased , the 1d map undergoes an infinite sequence of period - doubling bifurcations accumulating at a critical point @xmath4 , beyond which chaos sets in . using a renormalization group ( rg ) method , feigenbaum @xcite has discovered universal scaling behavior near the critical point @xmath4 .",
    "here we are interested in the period doublings in a system consisting of two 1d maps with a one - way coupling , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are state variables of the first and second subsystems , @xmath3 and @xmath8 are control parameters of the subsystems , and @xmath9 is a coupling parameter .",
    "note that the first ( drive ) subsystem acts on the second ( response ) subsystem , while the second subsystem does not influence the first subsystem .",
    "this kind of unidirectionally - coupled 1d maps are used as a model for open flow @xcite . a new kind of non - feigenbaum scaling behavior was found in a numerical and empirical way near a bicritical point @xmath10 where two critical lines of period - doubling transition to chaos in both subsystems meet @xcite .",
    "for this bicritical case , a rg analysis was also developed and the corresponding fixed point , governing the bicritical behavior , was numerically obtained by directly solving the rg fixed - point equation using a polynomial approximation @xcite . in this paper , using two different methods , we also make the rg analysis of the bicriticality , the results of which agree well with those of previous works .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sb ] we study the scaling behavior near a bicritical point @xmath10 , corresponding to a border of chaos in both subsystems , by directly following a period - doubling sequence converging to the point @xmath10 for a fixed value of @xmath9 . for this bicritical case , a new type of non - feigenbaum critical behavior appears in the second subsystem , while the first subsystem is in the feigenbaum critical state . employing two different methods",
    ", we make the rg analysis of the bicritical behavior in sec .",
    "[ sec : ra ] . to solve the rg fixed - point equation",
    ", we first use an approximate truncation method @xcite , corresponding to the lowest - order polynomial approximation .",
    "thus we analytically obtain the fixed point , associated with the bicritical behavior , and its relevant eigenvalues .",
    "compared with the previous numerical results @xcite , these analytic results are not bad as the lowest - order approximation . to improve accuracy",
    ", we also employ the `` eigenvalue - matching '' rg method @xcite , equating the stability multipliers of the orbit of level @xmath11 ( period @xmath12 ) to those of the orbit of the next level @xmath13 .",
    "thus we numerically obtain the bicritical point , the parameter and orbital scaling factors , and the critical stability multipliers .",
    "we note that the accuracy is improved remarkably with increasing the level @xmath11 .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "in this section we fix the value of the coupling parameter by setting @xmath14 and directly follow a period - doubling sequence converging to the bicritical point @xmath10 , which corresponds to a border of chaos in both subsystems . for this bicritical case ,",
    "the second subsystem exhibits a new type of non - feigenbaum critical behavior , while the first subsystem is in the feigenbaum critical state .",
    "the unidirectionally - coupled 1d maps ( [ eq : ucm ] ) has many attractors for fixed values of the parameters @xcite . for the case @xmath15",
    ", it breaks up into the two uncoupled 1d maps .",
    "if they both have stable orbits of period @xmath16 , then the composite system has @xmath16 different stable states distinguished by the phase shift between the subsystems .",
    "this multistability is preserved when the coupling is introduced , at least while its value is small enough . here",
    "we study only the attractors whose basins include the origin @xmath17 .",
    "such attractors become in - phase when @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",
    "stability of an orbit with period @xmath19 is determined by its stability multipliers , @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 determine the stability of the first and second subsystems , respectively .",
    "an orbit becomes stable when the moduli of both multipliers are less than unity , i.e. , @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig : sd ] shows the stability diagram of periodic orbits for @xmath14 . as the parameter @xmath3 is increased , the first subsystem exhibits a sequence of period - doubling bifurcations at the vertical straight lines , where @xmath25 . for small values of the parameter @xmath8",
    ", the period of oscillation in the second subsystem is the same as that in the first subsystem , as in the case of forced oscillation .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased for a fixed value of @xmath3 , a sequence of period - doubling bifurcations occurs in the second subsystem when crossing the non - vertical lines where @xmath26 .",
    "the numbers inside the different regions denote the period of the oscillation in the second subsystem .",
    "we consider a pair of the parameters @xmath27 , at which the periodic orbit of level @xmath11 ( period @xmath12 ) has the stability multipliers @xmath28 . hence , the point @xmath27 corresponds to a threshold of instability in both subsystems .",
    "some of such points are denoted by the open circles in fig .",
    "then such a sequence of @xmath27 converges to the bicritical point @xmath10 , corresponding to a border of chaos in both systems , with increasing the level @xmath11 .",
    "the bicritical point is denoted by the solid circle in fig .  1 . to locate the bicritical point with a satisfactory precision",
    ", we numerically follow the orbits of period @xmath29 up to level @xmath30 in a quadruple precision , and obtain the sequences of both the parameters @xmath27 and the orbit points @xmath31 approaching the origin .",
    "we first note that the sequences of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the first subsystem are the same as those in the 1d maps @xcite .",
    "hence , only the sequences of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the second subsystem are given in table [ tab : spo ] .",
    ".sequences of the parameter and the orbit point , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in the second subsystem . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have studied the scaling behavior of period doublings near the bicritical point , corresponding to a threshold of chaos in both subsystems . for this bicritical case",
    ", a new type of non - feigenbaum critical behavior appears in the second ( response ) subsystem , while the first ( drive ) subsystem is in the feigenbaum critical state . employing the truncation and eigenvalue - matching methods",
    ", we made the rg analysis of the bicritical behavior .",
    "for the case of the truncation method , we analytically obtained the fixed point , associated with the bicritical behavior , and its relevant eigenvalues .",
    "these analytic rg results are not bad as the lowest - order approximation . to improve the accuracy",
    ", we also employed the numerical eigenvalue - matching rg method , and obtained the bicritical point , the parameter and orbital scaling factors , and the critical stability multipliers .",
    "note that the accuracy in the numerical rg results is improved remarkably with increasing the level @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , these numerical rg results agree well with the results obtained by a direct numerical method .",
