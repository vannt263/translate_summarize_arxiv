    "pseudodiagrams are knot or link diagrams where some of the crossing information is missing .",
    "where there is missing information , instead of a crossing with clearly marked over- and under - strands , a _ precrossing _ or double - point of the curve appears in the diagram .",
    "pseudodiagrams of spatial graphs , knots and links were first introduced as potential models for biological applications by hanaki  @xcite .",
    "pseudoknots were first defined in  @xcite as equivalence classes of pseudodiagrams up to rigid vertex isotopy and a collection of natural reidemeister moves .",
    "this collection of moves includes the classical reidemeister ( r ) moves and a number of additional pseudo - reidemeister ( pr ) moves as seen in figure  [ rmoves ] .",
    "the most familiar representation of a given knot is that of a knot diagram which is a shadow of the knot decorated with crossing information at transverse intersection points .",
    "an alternate and sometimes more useful presentation is a gauss diagram which consists of a core circle oriented counterclockwise ( drawn to represent the entire curve of the oriented knot ) together with the pre - image of double - points connected by chords along the circle .",
    "the crossing information is indicated on the chord by an arrow pointing from the over - strand to the under - strand and a sign on the chord specifying whether the crossing is left or right handed .",
    "see figure  [ g - example ] .        in  @xcite",
    ", the definition of a gauss diagram was extended to pseudoknots as follows .",
    "all classical crossings in a pseudoknot are represented in the gauss diagram by a standard chord decorated with an arrow and a crossing sign .",
    "a precrossing is represented by a bold or thicker chord .",
    "we must take care , however , to indicate the proper ` handedness ' of the precrossing .",
    "figure  [ precrossing - ab ] indicates a general precrossing and its decorated arrow within the gauss diagram , and figure  [ pseudog - example ] gives an example of a pseudoknot and its gauss diagram .",
    "notice that in the gauss diagram , the precrossing arrow points in the same direction as the classical arrow would point if the precrossing were resolved positively .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for illustrations of gauss - diagrammatic versions of the r and pr moves .",
    "we note that not all gauss diagrams correspond to pseudoknots , but the set of gauss diagrams corresponds to a broader collection of virtual pseudoknots .",
    "there are two powerful pseudoknot invariants we focus our attention on in this paper , the signed were - set , introduced in  @xcite , and the gauss - diagrammatic invariant @xmath0 , defined in  @xcite .",
    "we will use the latter invariant to show that the former invariant is incomplete .",
    "the _ signed weighted resolution set _ ( or _ were - set _ ) of a pseudoknot @xmath1 is the set of ordered pairs @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the knot type of a resolution of @xmath1 and @xmath4 is the probability that @xmath3 is obtained from @xmath1 by a random choice of crossing information , assuming that positive and negative crossings are equally likely . in this",
    "set , knots and their mirror images are treated as distinct unless such a pair of knots are actually topologically equivalent .",
    "consider a gauss diagram of a ( virtual or classical ) pseudoknot , @xmath5 .",
    "define a map @xmath6 as follows .    1 .",
    "replace with chords all arrows in @xmath5 that are associated to precrossings .",
    "( i.e. , delete all arrowheads on precrossing arrows . )",
    "these chords will be called _",
    "prechords_. 2 .",
    "decorate each prechord @xmath7 with the integer value @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is the sum of the signs of the classical arrows that intersect @xmath7 .",
    "3 .   delete all classical arrows .",
    "delete any prechords @xmath7 that have adjacent endpoints and @xmath9 .",
    "the codomain of @xmath10 is the set of all chord diagrams such that each chord is decorated with an integer .",
    "we refer to this set as @xmath11 .",
    "we illustrate this definition with an example of a virtual pseudoknot @xmath1 and its corresponding decorated chord diagram @xmath0 in figure  [ i_example ] .    * , title=\"fig:\"]*,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "by construction , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are related by a move we will call a _ shadow flype _ , pictured in figure  [ flype ] .",
    "t is the shadow of a tangle in this figure .",
    "( this means that none of the crossings in the pseudotangle have been determined . )        in figure  [ flypegauss ] , we see the values of @xmath10 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 . because any equivalences between the values of @xmath10 must preserve the cyclic ordering of the endpoints of chords in the chord diagrams , the values of @xmath10 are distinct .",
    "thus , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "are distinct .     and",
    "@xmath13 together with @xmath14 and @xmath15.*,title=\"fig:\",height=144 ] and @xmath13 together with @xmath14 and @xmath15.*,title=\"fig:\",height=163 ]   and @xmath13 together with @xmath14 and @xmath15.*,title=\"fig:\",height=134 ] and @xmath13 together with @xmath14 and @xmath15.*,title=\"fig:\",height=158 ]              suppose @xmath12 and @xmath13 are related by a local shadow flype move .",
    "then there is a one - to - one correspondence between resolutions of @xmath12 and resolutions of @xmath13 , where a knot diagram @xmath19 obtained by resolving precrossings of @xmath12 is paired with a resolution @xmath20 of @xmath13 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are related by a single ( classical ) flype .",
    "thus , @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent equivalent knots . in effect , for any resolution of @xmath12 , we can resolve the crossings of @xmath13 such that all crossings not involved in the shadow flype agree , and crossings involved in the shadow flype are chosen so that the resulting diagram is related to the resolution of @xmath12 by a classical flype .",
    "the existence of such a correspondence establishes our desired result .",
    "we just saw for a specific example how the shadow flype affects a pseudodiagram , and we used the gauss - diagrammatic @xmath10 invariant to illustrate that this transformation changed the pseudoknot type .",
    "we d like to explore these effects more generally .",
    "how does a shadow flype transform the gauss diagram of a pseudodiagram ?",
    "secondly , how can the pair of examples in figure  [ counterexample ] be generalized to an infinite family of examples ?    in  @xcite , souli determines the effect on a gauss diagram of performing a flype move on an ordinary knot .",
    "we can immediately derive from his work the effect of a shadow flype on the gauss diagram @xmath5 of a pseudoknot @xmath1 .",
    "there are two possibilities for how the gauss diagram of a pseudoknot might be affected , illustrated in figure  [ flypechord ] .",
    "these diagrams should be interpreted as follows : in each horizontal ( vertical ) shaded region , there may be chords whose endpoints both lie within that region .",
    "arrows are omitted here since the direction of precrossing arrows does not affect the value of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we will limit our focus to considering shadow flypes on the level of chord diagrams .      to understand how the diagrams in figure  [ flypechord ] apply to an example",
    ", we provide the chord diagrams for shadows @xmath12 and @xmath13 in figure  [ flypegauss2 ] .",
    "as we can see , this pair of examples illustrates a type ii flype .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that this pair of examples is the smallest counterexample to the signed were - set conjecture that can be obtained from a shadow flype .",
    "this follows from two facts : ( 1 ) in order for a chord diagram to be obtainable from a classical pseudoknot , each chord must intersect an even number of chords , and ( 2 ) any two chord diagrams that are related by a planar isotopy are equivalent .        finally , let us observe that the @xmath12 , @xmath13 counterexample can be generalized to an infinite family of counterexamples , illustrated in figure  [ family ] .",
    "note that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be even for these pseudoknots to be non - virtual .",
    "the values of @xmath10 corresponding to these pseudoknots can be obtained from the chord diagrams shown simply by decorating each chord with a 0 .",
    "the one open question related to this work that we are most interested in considering in the future is how many _ non - equivalent _ shadows can be obtained from a given shadow by shadow - flyping .",
    "symmetries within chord diagrams may have the effect of producing equivalent pre- and post - flype diagrams , so not every possible flype move produces a new pseudoknot .",
    "this is an area for future exploration ."
