    "this paper can be thought of as an extension of the paper `` on the lego - teichmller game '' by bojko bakalov and alexander kirillov jr @xcite . in the paper @xcite",
    ", authors gave the description of how to represent a given smooth , oriented surface , possibly with boundary by gluing of several `` simple pieces '' .",
    "here `` simple pieces '' are just sphere with @xmath4 holes .",
    "one application of this is the construction of modular functor ; it suffices to define the vector spaces associated with sphere with @xmath4 holes . then since the behavior of modular functor under gluing is known , this defines a unique vector space associated to any surface",
    "of course , there are many different ways to represent a given surface as a result of gluing several spheres with @xmath4 holes , here @xmath4 can vary .",
    "so some natural questions arise ; like how one can describe different ways of gluing `` standard pieces '' that give the same surface ?",
    "let @xmath6 be the set of all such way of getting the surface @xmath0 from the `` simple pieces '' . in the paper @xcite",
    ", they described some simple moves or edges and some relations among them which turned @xmath6 into a connected and simply - connected complex .",
    "+ this definition of modular functor can be extended .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite group . and",
    "let @xmath1 be a given @xmath2-cover of @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible to extend the definition of modular functor from the surface , @xmath0 , to the @xmath2-covers of surface , @xmath1.this idea will be formalized in later paper .",
    "this extended modular functor will also satisfy a similar gluing axiom , just like the regular modular functor , but now we are gluing @xmath2-covers of surface and not just surface .",
    "thus if we know the value of the extended modular functor on the `` simple pieces '' , of course we need to know what are these `` simple pieces '' in this case , then this will be enough to define extended modular functor to any @xmath2-cover . since any @xmath2-cover can be constructed from the gluing of these `` simple pieces '' and the behavior of the extended modular functor under gluing is known , this will define a unique value for a given @xmath2-cover . + as in the paper of @xcite , we are faced with similar questions .",

    "is it possible to define some simple moves to go from one parameterization to the other ? is is possible to define all the relation between these moves ?",
    "ie describe when a sequence of moves applied to a given parameterization yields the same parameterization ?",
    "in other word , we are trying to define some simple moves and relations similar to the paper @xcite , which will turn @xmath7 into a connected and simply - connected complex .",

    "so both side of the above equation give rise to the same label on this @xmath80-th cut ( we can just forget about the @xmath285 move from both side since it does not have any effect ) .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "we need to show that every loop in @xmath6 can be lifted to a contractable loop in @xmath7 .",
    "first note that , it is enough to prove this for 2-cell or relations in @xmath6 .",
    "because , then any loop in @xmath6 can be break down to several 2-cell in @xmath6 , since @xmath6 is simply - connected .",
    "we then lift each 2-cell to a contractable loop in @xmath7 .",
    "then finally , we use part 3 of section 9.1 , to arrive at our answer .",
    "+ now we will show that every 2-cell in @xmath6 can be lifted to a contractable loop in @xmath7 .",
    "we first observe that all the 2-cell in @xmath6 , consist of @xmath663 and @xmath187 move .",
    "and each 2-cell has a corresponding exact 2-cell in @xmath7 .",
    "for example , consider rotation axiom , the 2-cell in @xmath6 is @xmath664 and the corresponding 2-cell in @xmath7 is @xmath665 .",
    "similarly for the braiding axiom , the 2-cell of @xmath6 is @xmath666 and @xmath667 and the corresponding 2-cell of @xmath7 is @xmath668 and @xmath669 .",
    "the only exception to this rule is the dehn twist axiom .",
    "dehn twist axiom for @xmath6 is @xmath670 and the corresponding dehn twist axiom for @xmath7 is @xmath671 , we have this extra @xmath503 move appearing in the case of @xmath7 . but",
    "this will not be a problem .",
    "more precisely , we do the following : + if @xmath672 is a 2-cell in @xmath6 , say starting at the vertex @xmath11 , then we first pick any point on the fiber of @xmath11 .",
    "say @xmath673 , it does not matter which point on the fiber we choose .",
    "then we apply the corresponding 2-cell move of @xmath7 to @xmath253 and this will give a contractable loop in @xmath7 .",
    "for example if we have the 2-cell @xmath674 in @xmath6 then a lifting of this 2-cell which is contractable is going to be @xmath675 in @xmath7 .",
    "look at the diagram on figure [ liftingofzcell ] .",
    "for the dehn twist , it is not a big difference .",
    "if @xmath676 is the 2-cell in @xmath6 then @xmath677 will be the corresponding lifting in @xmath7 which is of course contractible for the simple reason that @xmath671 is a 2-cell in @xmath7 .",
