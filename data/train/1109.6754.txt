    "researches in isoelectronic sequences of lighter atoms have been a subject of recent interest to study various atomic properties of low - lying atomic states and the transitions between them @xcite .",
    "accurate estimations of these properties require correlation corrections with breit and quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) effects @xcite . however , individual studies of all these effects are necessary to realize the relative strengths between them with increasing atomic number for different isoelectronic sequences . to implement these effects in different many - body theories , suitable form of matrix elements of their operators are necessary . from our literature survey , we have found a number of such formulations for the breit operator @xcite .",
    "however , in our work , we have implemented the gaunt interaction which is the magnetic part of the breit interaction @xcite and is considered to be an order of magnitude larger than the other part , called as the retardation part @xcite .",
    "hence the gaunt interaction is considered to provide a useful approximation to the breit interaction @xcite .",
    "the matrix element of the gaunt operator is reformulated to add with the coulomb operator in a self consistent approach at both the df as well as the cc level of calculations .    in recent years",
    ", a number of theoretical calculations have been performed on boron isoelectronic sequence which take into account the breit interaction in the atomic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "these calculations have been performed using different many - body approaches like configuration - interaction technique @xcite , multi - configuration dirac - fock method @xcite , weakest bound electron potential model theory @xcite , relativistic multireference configuration - interaction technique @xcite , multiconfiguration hartree - fock method @xcite , relativistic many - body perturbation theory @xcite etc .",

    "they have performed the rcc calculations on different transition properties among some low - lying states of these ions in the basis of dirac - coulomb hamiltonian . in their paper , they have highlighted the requirement of the breit interaction in the fine structure splitting of 2@xmath2 term of this sequence .",

    "the systematic investigations of both these effects with increasing atomic number can provide a comparative information about their contributions in the calculations of these properties .",
    "comparisons of the gaunt contributions at both the df and the cc levels of calculations have been explicitly studied to test the correlation effects on these .",
