    "invariant foliations , as well as invariant manifolds , provide geometric structures for understanding the qualitative behaviors of nonlinear dynamical systems , and they have been extensively studied for deterministic systems @xcite .    invariant manifolds or foliations for finite dimensional stochastic systems or stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) were studied in @xcite .",
