    "the detailed study of top quark pair production close to threshold constitutes a major part of the top quark physics program at the international linear collider ( ilc ) during its first phase running at lower energies .",
    "while the top quark mass ( in a threshold mass scheme  @xcite ) can be measured with a precision of around 100  mev from the c.m.energy where the cross section line - shape rises , accurate measurements of the top quark total width , the strong coupling and ( in the case of a light higgs ) the top yukawa coupling can be gained from the normalization and the form of the line - shape  @xcite .",
    "electroweak effects play a crucial role for theoretical predictions of top pair threshold production .",
    "apart from the @xmath1 production process , mediated either by virtual photon or z boson exchange , one also needs to account for initial state qed beam effects and the finite top quark lifetime in the leading order approximation . on the other hand , due to",
    "the fact that , close to threshold , the top quarks are produced with small relative velocities , @xmath2 , singularities proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath4 arise from virtual and real gluon radiation in @xmath5 qcd diagrams that need to be summed up to all orders in @xmath6 .",
    "these singularities arise from ratios of the kinematical scales @xmath7 ( `` hard '' ) , @xmath8 ( `` soft '' ) and @xmath9 ( `` ultrasoft '' ) that are governing the nonrelativistic @xmath1 dynamics , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the top three - momentum and kinetic energy , respectively .",
    "since the standard model top quark width @xmath12  gev is numerically comparable to the average top kinetic energy , it serves as an infrared cutoff and protects the nonrelativistic @xmath1 dynamics from nonperturbative qcd effects .    in recent years most",

    "as far as electroweak corrections are concerned no complete determination of all effects beyond the leading order level has yet been achieved for the total cross section . at leading order",
    "the three electroweak effects mentioned above can be treated independently : the top pair production is described by @xmath16 effective nrqcd operators with wilson coefficients that account for the propagation of the virtual photon and the z boson mediating the @xmath1 production process .",
    "the qed beam effects consisting of the machine - dependent beam energy spread , beamstrahlung and initial state radiation can be conveniently implemented through a luminosity spectrum that is convolved into the theoretical predictions without any initial state qed corrections  @xcite .",
    "the top quark width , on the other hand , is incorporated into nrqcd by an imaginary matching condition of a bilinear top quark mass operator and can be effectively accounted for by shifting the c.m.energy into the complex plane , @xmath17  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a systematic procedure for the theoretical treatment of the effects from the finite top quark lifetime for the total cross section beyond leading logarithmic ( ll ) order in the renormalization group improved approach was presented .",
