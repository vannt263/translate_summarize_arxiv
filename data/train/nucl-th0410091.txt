    "almost all matter around us is made of several dozen chemical elements and their isotopes .",
    "each element ( atom ) has a compact nucleus , made of protons and neutrons , and a cloud of electrons surrounding the nucleus .",
    "the proton and the neutron are baryons , i.e. , `` heavy '' particles .",
    "they are about two thousand times heavier than the electron .",
    "( the actual values of the masses are @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , see ref .  @xcite . )",
    "thus , the mass of an atom comes mostly from its heavy nucleus .",
    "a typical size of a nucleus is about five orders of magnitude smaller than a typical atomic size .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that the density of matter inside a nucleus is much larger than the density of matter made of chemical elements .",
    "typical densities inside nuclei are of order @xmath4 .",
    "to get an impression how large this is , it suffices to say that a tablespoon of a material with this density would weigh about a billion tonnes . creating even a tiny macroscopic sample of such matter in laboratory",
    "is impossible . on the other hand ,",
    "baryonic matter at even higher densities exists in the universe in the interior of compact stars .",
    "therefore , it is of fundamental importance to study such very dense matter .    protons and neutrons , as well as all mesons and baryons that may appear in dense matter , are strongly interacting particles .",
    "their properties and the properties of dense baryonic matter are , in principle , described by the microscopic theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the only problem is that qcd is a rather complicated non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "the lagrangian density of the theory is written in terms of quark fields which carry color charges .",
    "because of the property of confinement , however , quarks can not exist in vacuum as free particles .",
    "instead , they combine with other quarks and antiquarks to form color neutral hadrons ( i.e. , mesons and baryons ) whose description is not easy in the framework of qcd .",
    "it is known that baryons are not point - like particles .",
    "they have a typical size of about @xmath5 . in sufficiently dense matter , therefore , baryons can be forced to stay so close to one another that they would overlap . at such densities ,",
    "constituent quarks are shared by neighboring baryons and , with increasing the density further , quarks should eventually become mobile over large distances .",
    "this means that quarks become deconfined .",
    "when this happens , it does not make sense to talk about hadronic matter any more .",
    "it is transformed into quark matter .",
    "the properties of such matter is the topic of these lectures .",
    "it was suggested long time ago that quark matter may exist inside central regions of compact stars @xcite . by making use of the property of asymptotic freedom in qcd @xcite ,",
    "it was argued that quarks interact weakly , and that realistic calculations taking full account of strong interactions are possible for sufficiently dense matter @xcite .",
    "the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite consisted of the two main points : ( i ) the long - range qcd interactions are screened in dense medium causing no infrared problems , and ( ii ) at short distances , the interaction is weak enough to allow the use of the perturbation theory . as we shall see below , the real situation in dense quark matter is slightly more subtle .      by assuming that very dense matter is indeed made of weakly interacting quarks , one could try to understand the thermodynamic properties of the corresponding ground state by first completely neglecting the interaction between quarks . in order to construct the ground state ,",
    "it is important to keep in mind that quarks are fermions , i.e. , particles with a half - integer spin , @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , quarks should obey the pauli exclusion principle which says that no two identical quarks can simultaneously occupy the same quantum state .    in the ground state of zero temperature non - interacting quark matter , quarks occupy all available quantum states with the lowest possible energies .",
    "this is described formally by the following quark distribution function : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the quark chemical potential , and @xmath9 is the energy of a free quark ( with mass @xmath10 ) in the quantum state with the momentum @xmath11 ( by definition , @xmath12 , indicating that all states with the momenta less than the fermi momentum @xmath13 are occupied .",
    "the states with the momenta greater than the fermi momentum @xmath13 are empty , i.e. , @xmath14 for @xmath15 .    in the chiral limit , i.e. ,",
    "when the quark mass is vanishing , the pressure of zero temperature free quark matter is given by @xcite @xmath16 where the overall factor @xmath17 counts the total number of degenerate quark states , namely 2 spin states ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 flavor states ( e.g. , up , down and strange ) , and @xmath20 color states ( e.g. , red , green and blue ) . the extra term @xmath21 in the expression for the pressure ( [ pressure_0 ] ) , called the bag constant , was added by hand .",
    "this term effectively assigns a nonzero contribution to the vacuum pressure and , in this way , provides the simplest modelling of the quark confinement in qcd @xcite .",
    "[ note that the vacuum pressure is higher than the pressure of quark matter when @xmath22 . ] here , we ignore the requirements of the charge neutrality and the @xmath0 equilibrium in quark matter .",
    "these will be addressed in detail in the second lecture .",
    "the energy density of quark matter reads @xmath23 thus , one arrives at the following equation of state : @xmath24 this equation of state could be easily generalized to the case of nonzero quark masses and/or to the case of non - equal chemical potentials for different quarks .",
    "also , it could be further improved by adding the lowest order corrections due to the interaction .",
    "for example , to leading order in coupling , the interaction results in the following correction to the pressure @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the value of the running coupling constant of strong interactions defined at the scale of the quark chemical potential .",
    "the next to leading order corrections can also be calculated @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the equation of state in eq .",
    "( [ pressure_0 ] ) , or its generalization , provides a good approximation for the description of weakly interacting quark matter .",
    "below we argue , however , that some underlying assumptions regarding the ground state of such quark matter are not correct .",
    "it appears that the perturbative ground state of quark matter , characterized by the distribution function in eq .",
    "( [ f_f_t=0 ] ) , is unstable when there is an attractive ( even arbitrarily weak in magnitude ! )",
    "interaction between quarks .",
    "this is because of the famous cooper instability @xcite that develops as a result of the formation of cooper pairs @xmath27 made of quarks from around the highly degenerate fermi surface , i.e. , quarks with the absolute value of momenta @xmath28 .",
    "cooper pairs are bosons , and they occupy the same lowest energy quantum state at zero temperature , producing a bose condensate . in the presence of such a condensate of cooper pairs , the ground state of quark matter becomes a ( color ) superconductor .",
    "this is very similar to the ground state of the electron system in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory of low - temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the only real difference comes from the fact that quarks , unlike electrons , come in various flavors ( e.g. , up , down and strange ) and carry non - abelian color charges . to emphasize this difference , superconductivity in quark matter is called _",
    "color superconductivity_. for recent reviews on color superconductivity , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it was known for a long time that dense quark matter should be a color superconductor @xcite .",
    "in many studies , however , this fact was commonly ignored . only recently , the potential importance of this phenomenon was appreciated . to large extent ,",
    "this was triggered by the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite that the value of the color superconducting gap could be as large as @xmath29 at baryon densities existing in the central regions of compact stars , i.e. , at densities which are a few times larger than the normal nuclear density , @xmath30 .",
    "this very natural estimate for the value of the gap in qcd , in which a typical energy scale itself is @xmath31 , opened a wide range of new theoretical possibilities , and the subject bursted with numerous studies .",
    "the main reason is that the presence of such a large energy gap in the quark spectrum may allow to extract clear signatures of color superconducting states of matter in observational data from compact stars .",
    "as in low - temperature superconductors , one of the main consequences of color superconductivity in dense quark matter is the appearance of a nonzero energy gap in the one - particle spectrum , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the gap . the presence of the gap in the energy spectrum should affect transport properties ( e.g. , conductivities and viscosities ) of quark matter .",
    "thus , if quark matter exists in the interior of compact stars , this will be reflected , for example , in the cooling rates and in the rotational slowing down of such stars .",
    "also , a nonzero gap modifies thermodynamic properties , e.g. , the specific heat and the equation of state . in application to stars , this could modify theoretical predictions for the mass - radius relations , or even suggest the existence of a new family of compact stars .",
    "color superconductivity may affect directly as well as indirectly many other observed properties of stars . in some cases ,",
    "for example , superconductivity may be accompanied by the baryon superfluidity and/or the electromagnetic meissner effect .",
    "if matter is superfluid , rotational vortices would be formed in the stellar core , and they would carry a portion of the angular momentum of the star . because of the meissner effect , the star interior could become threaded with magnetic flux tubes . in either case , the star evolution may be affected .",
    "in general , it is of great phenomenological interest to perform a systematic study of all possible effects of color superconductivity in compact stars .",
    "before this can be done , however , one needs to know the structure of the qcd phase diagram and properties of various color superconducting phases in detail .",
    "despite the recent progress in the field , such knowledge still remains patchy .",
    "while many different phases of quark matter have been proposed , there is no certainty that all possibilities have already been exhausted .",
    "this is especially so when additional requirements of charge neutrality and @xmath0 equilibrium are imposed .    in the rest of this lecture ,",
    "the main color superconducting phases , that involve different number of pairing quark flavors , will be reviewed briefly .",
    "the role of charge neutrality and @xmath0 equilibrium in quark matter will be discussed in the second lecture .",
    "it is instructive to start this lecture from the description of the simplest color superconducting phase , namely the two - flavor color superconductor ( 2sc ) .",
    "this is a color superconducting phase with the spin-0 cooper pairing in quark matter made of up and down quarks .",
    "as we discussed in the previous subsection , color superconductivity comes as a result of the cooper instability driven by an attractive interaction between quarks . to study this instability in detail",
    ", one needs to specify the origin and the strength of the interaction . at very large densities ,",
    "when quark matter is weakly interacting , the dominant interaction between quarks is provided by the one - gluon exchange .",
    "then , the cooper pairing dynamics , including the screening effects due to dense medium as well as the effects due to higher order corrections , can be studied from first principles within the framework of qcd .",
    "some key details of the analysis in this regime are given below .",
    "we consider quark fields @xmath35 in the fundamental representation of the su(3)@xmath36 color gauge group .",
    "these fields carry flavor ( @xmath37 ) and color ( @xmath38 ) indices .",
    "the qcd lagrangian density reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the vector gauge field in the adjoint representation of su(3)@xmath36 , @xmath41 is the field strength , and the generators of color transformations are defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "the current quark masses and the quark chemical potential are denoted by @xmath44 and @xmath8 , respectively . at high densities",
    ", one can neglect small current masses of quarks .",
    "then , the qcd lagrangian density ( [ qcd - action ] ) becomes invariant under su(2)@xmath45su(2)@xmath46 global chiral transformations .    in qcd ,",
    "the constituent masses of quarks @xmath47 are generated dynamically , and they can be very different from the current masses @xmath44 , appearing in the lagrangian density . at zero density , for example , typical values of the constituent quark masses",
    "are of order @xmath48 even in the chiral limit . at high densities , on the other hand",
    ", the masses of the up and down quarks become small .",
    "this is because they are proportional to the value of the chiral condensate @xmath49 which melts in dense matter .",
    "thus , it is often also justified to neglect the constituent quark masses in studies of color superconducting phases .",
    "the interaction vertex in the lagrangian density ( [ qcd - action ] ) has a non - trivial color structure given by the color generators @xmath50 . as a result ,",
    "the quark - quark scattering amplitude in the one - gluon exchange approximation is proportional to the following color tensor : @xmath51 the first antisymmetric term corresponds to the _ attractive _ antitriplet channel , while the second symmetric term corresponds to the repulsive sextet channel , see fig .",
    "[ fig-1-glu ] .",
    "it is the first antisymmetric antitriplet channel that plays the crucial role in cooper pairing .",
    "here , it is appropriate to note that quark matter is unlikely to be truly weakly interacting at moderate densities existing in the central regions of compact stars , i.e. , @xmath52 . in this case",
    ", the use of the microscopic theory of strong interactions is very limited , and one has to rely on various effective models of qcd . a very simple type of such a model is the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with a local four - fermion interaction @xcite .",
    "originally , this model was introduced for the description of nucleons with dynamically generated masses .",
    "nowadays , it is also commonly used for the description of quarks .",
    "for example , the njl type models were used in refs .",
    "@xcite for the description of color superconducting phases .",
    "one of the simplest njl models , that respects the su(2)@xmath45su(2)@xmath46 global chiral symmetry ( in the limit @xmath53 ) , is defined by the following lagrangian density @xcite : @xmath54 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & g_d ( i \\bar{\\psi}^c \\varepsilon \\epsilon^a \\gamma_5 \\psi )   ( i \\bar{\\psi } \\varepsilon \\epsilon^a \\gamma_5 \\psi^c ) , \\label{njl - action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the charge - conjugate spinor and @xmath56 is the charge conjugation matrix .",

    "the strength of the coupling constant @xmath66 is taken to be proportional to the value of @xmath67 as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a dimensionless parameter of order 1 .",

    "this is motivated by the microscopic qcd interaction , as well as by the instanton motivated models @xcite .",
    "now let us discuss the color and flavor structure of the condensate of cooper pairs in the 2sc ground state .",

    "the color structure of the one - gluon exchange interaction in eq .",
    "( [ t - t ] ) shows that the color antisymmetric antitriplet channel is attractive .",
    "the antisymmetric color channel is also attractive in the instanton motivated models of ref .",
    "this is reflected in the color structure of the condensate of spin-0 cooper pairs , @xmath70 which is antisymmetric in the color indices of the constituent quarks . as one can check ( not shown explicitly ) , this spin-0 condensate is also antisymmetric in dirac indices .",
    "then , in accordance with the pauli exclusion principle , it should be antisymmetric in flavor indices as well .",
    "the presence of the @xmath71 matrix on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 2sc - cond ] ) makes the condensate a scalar .",
    "a similar condensate without @xmath71 is a pseudoscalar which is disfavored in qcd because of the instanton effects .",
    "the color antitriplet condensate ( [ 2sc - cond ] ) may have an arbitrary orientation in the color space . by making use of the global color transformations ,",
    "this orientation can be changed as convenient .",
    "it is conventional to choose the condensate to point in the third ( blue ) color direction , @xmath72 . in this case , the cooper pairs in the 2sc phase are made of the red and green quarks only , and the blue quarks do not participate in the pairing .",

    "there exist , however , several approximate symmetries which are broken .",
    "one of them is the approximate u(1)@xmath73 symmetry which is a good symmetry at high density when the instantons are screened @xcite .",
    "its breaking in the 2sc phase results in a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "additional four exotic pseudo - nambu - goldstone states may appear as a result of a less obvious approximate axial color symmetry discussed in ref .",

    "the vector - like su(3)@xmath36 color gauge group of qcd is broken down to the su(2)@xmath36 subgroup .",
    "therefore , five out of total eight gluons of su(3)@xmath36 become massive due to the anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "the other three gluons , which correspond to the unbroken su(2)@xmath36 , do not interact with the gapless blue quasiparticles .",

    "it appears , however , that the one - gluon interaction is partially screened by surrounding dense medium .",
    "thus , before studying the pairing dynamics between quarks , we first address the modification of gluon properties due to dense medium .",

    "this contribution is large compared to all other contributions in qcd ( e.g. , those from the ghost and the gluon loops ) because it is proportional to the density of quark states at the fermi surface ( as well as to the coupling constant @xmath88 ) , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "the corresponding approximation , in which the sub - leading terms suppressed by powers of the quark chemical potential @xmath8 are neglected , is called the hard dense loop ( hdl ) approximation .",

    "this is comparable to the value of the debye screening length in each of the two quark phases .",
    "therefore , the effects of charge screening , which have been neglected so far and which are known to increase the surface energy @xcite , may still change the conclusion .      in recent years",
    "there was a lot of progress in understanding the mechanism of color superconductivity and in studying physical properties of various possible color superconducting phases of dense quark matter . at present",
    ", one can say that the qcd theory of strong interactions at asymptotic densities is most likely to have a color superconducting ground state .",
    "unfortunately , however , one can not say with certainty what is the critical value of the baryon density at which color superconductivity first appears .",
    "because of this , one does not know for sure if color superconducting phases could appear at highest densities existing in the universe .    in nature , very dense baryonic matter exists in compact stars .",
    "thus , it is possible that color superconductivity exists in the central regions of the heaviest compact stars .",
    "this conjecture has not yet been ( dis-)proved , and it should come under scrutiny in the near future . in this connection , it might be appropriate to mention that there were recent observations on the cooling @xcite of one neutron star and the radius @xcite of another that led the authors to suggest the presence of quark matter .",
    "these suggestions have been disputed @xcite .",
    "however , the current situation , where there is no unambiguous evidence that deconfined quarks play a role in compact stars , may well change as further observations are made .",
    "one of the main consequences of color superconductivity in dense matter is the appearance of an energy gap in the quasiparticle spectrum . in qcd ,",
    "the typical value of the gap is @xmath29 .",
    "the presence of such a large gap is likely to affect many physical properties of matter , which in their turn should be reflected in the observational properties of stars .",
    "it is of great interest , therefore , to perform a systematic study of the properties of dense baryonic matter under conditions typical for the interior of stars .",
    "the goal of such studies should be a clear theoretical prediction of the most favorable phases of matter inside stars . also , one should work out the key physical properties of different phases that could have an unambiguous imprint on the observational data from stars",
    ". such a theoretical basis would be crucial in an attempt to discover new ( e.g. , quark ) states of matter in nature .",
    "the current understanding of color superconducting phases of qcd at large baryon chemical potential @xmath8 may also turn out to be useful for developing alternative methods to treat qcd at nonzero @xmath8 on the lattice @xcite .",
    "as is known , there are not so many methods to study qcd from first principles",
    ". one of them is the method of lattice calculations @xcite . as of now",
    ", the lattice calculations have produced many results for qcd at finite temperatures and vanishing baryon chemical potential @xmath361 @xcite .",
    "there are also some results at nonzero but small values of the baryon chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the lattice calculations at large nonzero @xmath8 are problematic because of the famous sign problem . at @xmath362 , the fermion determinant in",
    "the functional integral becomes complex , and the standard numerical techniques , which rely on a probability interpretation of the integrand , can not be easily applied .",
    "thus , new approaches and new ideas are needed .",
    "building on the knowledge gained from lattice calculations at nonzero temperature as well as from the effective models of qcd at nonzero chemical potential , one would like to get eventually a complete qcd phase diagram in the plane of temperature and quark chemical potential .",
    "the knowledge of such a diagram is not only of a theoretical importance .",
    "different regions of the phase diagram describe physical conditions that can be realized , for example , during the evolution of the early universe or in the heavy ion collisions .",
    "there is also a region at nonzero baryon chemical potentials which is responsible for the physics of stars . in order to understand the corresponding physics ,",
    "one first has to know the locations of the critical lines and the types of the phase transitions .",
    "some basic features of the qcd diagram have already started to emerge @xcite .",
    "it will probably take many years before the complete phase diagram is understood in detail .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the iard 2004 conference and the organizers of the helmholtz international summer school and workshop on _ hot points in astrophysics and cosmology _ for their invitation to present these lectures .",
    "also , i thank michael buballa , valery gusynin , paul ellis , matthias hanauske , deog - ki hong , mei huang , volodya miransky , micaela oertel , dirk rischke , stefan rster , gordon semenoff , and rohana wijewardhana for very fruitful collaboration on various topics in color superconductivity . this work was supported by gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) and by bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung ( bmbf ) .",
