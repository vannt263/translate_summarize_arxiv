    "passwords remain the most common means of authenticating humans to computer systems . yet",
    ", passwords are also among the most common points of failure of security systems @xcite . according to an investigation report in 2011 @xcite , stolen login credentials accounted for nearly a third of corporate data breach incidents , out of which ,",
    "more than a quarter were estimated to be carried out using a form of a guessing attack .",
    "poorly chosen passwords undermine an otherwise secure authentication system .",
    "users tend to choose easy to remember passwords @xcite .",
    "this is rationalizable as attempts in balancing usability costs with perceived security .",
    "managing the utility vs. security trade - off is also a relevant problem in the application of cryptographic techniques , which usually rely on maintaining a key unknown to any adversary .",
    "longer keys provide stronger security guarantees but at the same time inflict larger storage and computational costs on the system . using cryptographic techniques , therefore ,",
    "entails trading off utility for security , either through the choice of key size or the method of key generation .",
    "either way , the decision must be made in the context of adversaries .",
    "guessing attacks are often categorized as _",
    "online _ and _ offline _ based on their context of execution @xcite .",
    "online attacks involve interacting with the target system .",
    "in such an attack , adversaries are often limited in the number of ( failed ) guesses they can make ( within a certain time period ) before the system prevents any further interaction . in the case of password authentication , this is usually an account lock - out that requires intervention of the legitimate user using an alternate channel of authentication ( email , phone , etc . ) .    in _ offline _",
    "attacks , adversaries are assumed to have collected sufficient data to examine unlimited number of guesses , and are only constrained by their computational resources . in the case of password authentication , for example , this data can be the leaked hashes of user passwords , enabling the attackers to compute hashes of their guesses and compare them for a match , theoretically an unlimited number of times .",
    "another example of an offline attack setting is when an adversary eavesdrops a cryptographic response to a predictable challenge in a challenge - response authentication protocol .",
    "although unlimited in the number of guesses , adversaries in such offline scenarios still need to be wary of costs of trying guesses as computation of password hashes or cryptographic responses are not instantaneous or free ( specially , noting that hash functions for hashing passwords are intentionally chosen to be slow on hardware to dissuade brute - force attacks ) .",
    "hence , the response of such adversaries is governed by the computational / time cost per each guess .",
    "an adversary may obtain a pre - computed list of hashes to remove ( or a _ rainbow _ table to mitigate ) the computational burden during the execution of the attack .",
    "in such cases , the bottle - neck becomes the storage requirement for such a table , which implies a cap on the number of available guesses , similar to the online case .",
    "we will collectively refer to passwords or cryptographic keys as _",
    "secrets_. we also use the terms _ capped - guesses _ and _ costly - guesses _ to respectively describe the following two settings : ( 1 )  adversaries are limited in their number of guesses , e.g. in online password attacks in the presence of a rate limiting mechanism , or in offline attacks that use storage - limited pre - computed tables ; and ( 2 )  adversaries incur a cost per each guess , e.g. in brute - force offline attacks . regardless of the type of the guessing attack , the inherent behavioral or systematic preferences over the secret space can be exploited by adversaries and boost their guessing efficiency .",
    "therefore , any secret picking policy that aims to achieve a desirable trade - off between usability and security must evaluate the possible reaction of a rational adversary given their capabilities .",
    "in particular , it is insufficient to analyze the decisions of either the users or the adversaries without taking into account the reaction of the other .",
    "game theory provides tools to analyze such strategic interactions .",
    "the notion of _ equilibrium _ , in particular , describes how rational parties would eventually behave when faced against each other by characterizing their mutually - optimal strategies .",
    "the basic question at the heart of this paper is the following : given a known uneven usability cost over the space of secrets , how can the defender optimally randomize in picking a secret ?",
    "the main contribution of the paper is answering this fundamental question .",
    "specially :    * we present novel decision and game - theoretic models for both capped - guesses and costly - guesses settings that are simple enough to allow analysis yet general enough to cover all the cases described above . *",
    "we provide complete analysis of these games and discuss the security implications of the solutions .",
    "specifically , we derive optimal secret selection policies with respect to different strategic metrics , namely , the strategically pessimistic solutions ( maximin ) , the mutual - best - response solutions ( nash equilibria  ne ) , and the optimal commitment strategies ( strong stackelberg equilibria  sse ) . * for capped - guesses settings , we show that , interestingly , the optimal picking strategies still constitute uniform distributions despite the uneven preferences of the picker over the secret space .",
    "the trade - off is achieved by randomizing only over a ( lower cost ) subset of the secret space , while the probability distribution over the subset is uniform .",
    "the size of the subset is influenced by the picker s trade - off parameters and ( only ) the cap on the available guesses .",
    "the optimal guessing strategies are restricted to the same subset though they are not uniform .",
    "instead , the guesser probes the picker s more favored secrets in that subset with higher probabilities .",
    "we also show that for this scenario , all of the different strategic metrics of maximin , ne and sse lead to the same solution for the picker .",
    "* for the costly - guesses settings , we find a surprising result , reminiscent of the prisoner s dilemma situation : aside from trivial cases , the ne strategies of the picker fail to yield any desirable security level , irrespective of the size of the secret space or the cost associated with the loss of the secret .",
    "we demonstrate how the picker can retrieve a desirable usability - security trade - off using _ commitment _ to optimal randomizations .",
    "we also notice that these optimal commitment ( sse ) strategies for this case are almost never completely uniform , though they resemble uniform selection , with diminishing tails on costlier secrets . *",
    "we provide numerical illustrations of our analyses using examples such as the leaked rockyou password dataset and cryptographic keys with increasing costs in their size .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "most of the technical proofs in the paper are relegated to the appendices in our technical report@xcite.the technical proofs of the results are all aggregated in the appendices of this technical report .",
    "in what follows , we progressively construct the model of our non - zero - sum two - person games between the _ picker _ , and the _ guesser_. critically , we assume that the parameters of the games are `` common knowledge '' , i.e. , both players are aware of the presence and type of the game , the utilities and the information available to each other .    the picker ( she ) chooses a _",
    "secret _ from the finite set of all secrets @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 denote a pure ( i.e. , deterministic ) _ action _ of the picker .",
    "@xmath2 is thus the picker s _ pure action set_. the picker has uneven preferences over this set of secrets . in the case of password selection , for instance",
    ", this preference could be related to the memorability and ease of use : simpler passwords are easier to remember and less cumbersome to type in . in the spirit of the von neumann - morgenstern utility theorem @xcite , we model these preferences by assigning different costs to different secrets .",
    "specifically , let the whole set of secrets be partitioned into disjoint non - empty subsets @xmath3 , ",
    ", @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 for all @xmath6 , @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , such that the picker incurs a usability cost of @xmath10 if she picks any of the members of the set @xmath11 as her secret .",
    "without loss of generality , assume @xmath12 .",
    "hence , in the absence of any other considerations , the picker prefers to choose her secret from set @xmath11 rather than @xmath13 when @xmath14 , as she assigns a lower usability cost to secrets from the first set .",
    "these data are determined , for instance in the case of password choice , by statistical investigation of the past databases of cracked passwords , e.g. , as published in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , these sets can represent passwords that minimally satisfy an _ increasingly more complex _",
    "password creation rule - sets .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 can be the set of all dictionary words in lower case , @xmath15 the set of all dictionary words but requiring a mix of capital letters , @xmath16 having the additional rule of including a number as well , @xmath17 requiring a symbolic character too , etc .    the guesser ( he ) makes guesses about the choice of the picker . upon the discovery of the secret , i.e. , a correct guess , the guesser wins a gain of @xmath18 , and the picker incurs a loss of @xmath19 .",
    "the guesses are either constrained in number or subject to cost .",
    "we will investigate these two cases separately in sections  [ sec : model : capped_guesses ] and [ sec : model : costly_guesses ] respectively . in what follows ,",
    "we provide two numerical instances of the model .",
    "note that these numerical examples are mainly for the purpose of illustrating the analysis .",
    "( top ) rockyou dataset password frequency and the derived cost model .",
    "( bottom ) fraction of passwords guessed as a function of number of guesses . ]    the rockyou password dataset  @xcite contains the passwords of around 32 million users of the rockyou gaming site .",
    "the data - breach that produced the list was particularly costly as the site did not bother hashing its users passwords .",
    "the list is complete , containing both very common passwords ( the password `` 123456 '' occurs 290729 times ) , as well as many unique ones ( 2459760 passwords appear only once ) . as a result",
    ", the list has been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : pass - dataset ] ( top ) summarizes the frequency ( dark line ) of the passwords in the whole dataset .",
    "the passwords in the figure are ordered in decreasing frequency of appearance .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pass - dataset ] ( bottom ) demonstrates the strength of the passwords in the dataset using a simple metric quantifying the likelihood of a successful brute - force attack against a uniformly picked user in the dataset as a function of number of guesses , assuming the attacker knew the exact distribution of passwords in the dataset . as a frame of reference",
    ", we also include a similar metric assuming the users picked their password uniformly from the 11884632 different passwords in the dataset ( solid dark line ) or if all 32 million users picked their passwords uniquely ( solid light line ) .    as a candidate for the partitions , we group the passwords based on their frequency of appearance as an indirect measure of their cost .",
    "namely , we group the passwords with the highest frequency in @xmath20 , passwords with the second highest frequency in @xmath15 , so on , which makes the last partition @xmath21 as the set of all the passwords that appear only once .",
    "we use the inverse of frequency of a password as a rough estimate of its usability cost .",
    "after normalization , we set the usability costs to range from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the cost associated with each partition can be seen as the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pass - dataset ] ( top ) .    in section  [ sec : example - capped - password - analysis ] and section",
    "[ sec : example - costly - password - analysis ] we will compare the behavior of users in the dataset to that of their equilibrium behavior for each of our two attack settings .       synthetic cost model for selection of cryptographic keys , with cost proportional to linear and cubic power of key length . ]",
    "the selection of secret keys for cryptographic protocols is usually out of the hands of humans , nevertheless , the design decision of picking the strength of the key ( usually a function of its length ) entails the same cost / risk trade - offs .",
    "[ fig : keys - model ] summarizes the space of possible keys for two hypothetical cryptographic constructs . in both",
    "we assume a key can be anywhere between 0 and 64 bits .",
    "the examples differ only in the costs associated with each key . a cost linear in the length of key approximately models the trade - off in symmetric key systems such as aes which uses a number of rounds proportional to key length .",
    "the cubic relation is more appropriate approximation of public / private schemes such as naive implementations of rsa whose computation time scales cubically with key length @xcite .",
    "note that in our analysis we will assume that the length of the key is not known to a guesser , something that is usually not true of public / private schemes .    in sections",
    "[ sec : example - capped - keys - analysis ] , [ sec : example - costly - keys - analysis ] , [ sec : example - costly - keys - stack ] we examine the equilibrium strategies of the picker and guesser given each of these two cost models .",
    "in the _ capped - guesses _ scenario , the guesser , _ without observing the action of the picker _ , chooses at most @xmath24 elements from the set of possible secrets @xmath25 , as his guesses .",
    "we assume , naturally , that @xmath24 does not depend on the actual guesses chosen .",
    "the pure action of the guesser , which we denote by @xmath26 , is hence a subset of @xmath25 of size @xmath24 , since it is in the guesser s best interest to use all @xmath24 of his guesses . in the case of password selection , for example",
    ", each action represents an instance of a pre - computed table with which the guesser chooses to launch a dictionary attack .",
    "the action set of the guesser is therefore : @xmath27 , the set of all possible pre - computed tables of size @xmath24 .",
    "the number @xmath24 represents the prowess of the guesser determined by the physical limitations in place : for instance , in the case of pre - computed table attacks on passwords , @xmath24 is determined by how much memory each hash entry occupies and how much total memory the attacker has available for the table . alternatively , in an online password attack , it can be the number of tries he is allowed to make before getting locked out .",
    "we assume @xmath28 , since otherwise , the guesser trivially can find the secret with certainty . a ( pure ) _ strategy profile",
    "_ here is simply a pair of picker and guesser actions , @xmath29 .",
    "the problem is the following : determine best strategies for the picker to choose her secret and the guesser to construct his guessing dictionary , when both parties are _ rational _ decision makers .",
    "the problem can be modeled as a _ simultaneous move _ game .",
    "note that in game - theory , the term `` simultaneous move '' does not necessarily imply synchronicity , rather , the lack of observation of the move of other players ( or any signal about it ) before making a move .",
    "otherwise , there is a sequentiality in the occurrences of the actions taken in our problem : the picker picks first . in our capped - guesses game ,",
    "the `` actions '' and `` strategies '' simply coincide . to complete the model ,",
    "we next provide the utilities of the players given a strategy profile @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the utilities of the picker and the guesser respectively .",
    "compactly put , we have : @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the indicator function , of a set @xmath35 is a function @xmath36 defined as the following : @xmath37 if @xmath38 , and @xmath39 if @xmath40 . ] and @xmath41 is the usability cost of secret @xmath42 . note that this summation only contains one non - zero element : if the picked secret is from partition @xmath43 , she incurs the usability cost of @xmath10 .",

    "a commonly used notion of a solution is nash equilibrium ( ne in short ) , which informally put , is a strategy profile that consists of simultaneously optimal responses to each other , keeping the others strategies fixed , i.e. , strategy profiles that are resistant against unilateral deviations of players .",
    "formally , in our two player game , this means the following : the strategy pair @xmath44 is a ( pure ) ne if and only if : @xmath45 and @xmath46 , in , i.e. , @xmath47 for all @xmath48 and @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that `` pure '' nash equilibrium is not a suitable solution concept for our game .",
    "in fact , except in trivial cases , no pure ne exists .",
    "this is because a pure strategy of the picker means selection of a specific secret .",
    "the best response of the guesser is then simply to include that secret in his guess dictionary .",
    "but then , the picker would have been better off to deviate and choose a different secret and not incur the potentially huge cost of having her secret revealed with certainty . in other words , deviation from any pure action ( except in trivial cases ) is beneficial for the picker .",
    "a similar argument can be made for the guesser .",
    "the above discussion motivates the search for a solution among _ mixed strategies _ , which involve randomization thereby injecting ambiguity about the choice of each player .",
    "specifically , a mixed strategy of a player is a probability distribution over her set of pure strategies .",
    "for any finite nonempty set @xmath51 , let @xmath52 represent the set of all probability distributions over it .",
    "that is : @xmath53 for a given probability distribution @xmath54 , let the _ support _ of @xmath55 , or @xmath56 , denote the subset of the domain of @xmath55 that receives a strictly positive probability , that is : @xmath57 moreover , for a given probability distribution @xmath54 and a given subset @xmath58 , let @xmath59 represent the probability measure of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath55 , that is , let @xmath61 .",

    ". a mixed strategy of the guesser , @xmath71 , specifies the probability that each feasible dictionary ( table ) is selected . for our model , it is often simpler to instead specify the marginal probabilities that each secret is tried by the guesser .",
    "specifically , let us define @xmath72 such that @xmath73 denotes the probability that secret @xmath42 is in the ( @xmath24-sized ) table of the guesser .",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath63 are related through : @xmath74 . moreover , using the notion of probability measure and the fact that all members of the same partition by definition have the same choosing cost for the picker , we have : @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the expressions in can be simplified as : @xmath76 a mixed ne is defined in the same way as a pure ne , except that the optimization variables and the optimization spaces are replaced accordingly .",
    "the set of pure ne are contained in the set of mixed ne , since pure strategies can be obtained from degenerate distributions over the strategies .",
    "that is , a mixed strategy profile @xmath77 is a mixed ne iff : @xmath78    [ [ solution - concepts-2 - 3-maximin - and - minimax ] ] solution concepts 2 & 3  maximin and minimax + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a ( mixed ) strategy of the picker @xmath79 is a _",

    "this is the mixed strategy that guarantees ( secures ) the picker at least her maximin utility irrespective of the strategy of the guesser .",
    "for this reason , maximin strategies are sometimes also referred to as `` security '' strategies .",
    "maximin strategies are recipe for action when a player is strategically pessimistic , in that she believes the opponent(s ) behave in such a way to hurt her utility the most , as opposed to selfishly maximize their own utilities . hence , the focus is solely on the utility of that player , and rationality of other players is not taken into account .",

    "hence , hurting the expected pay - off of the opponent the most is exactly equivalent to helping your own expected pay - off the most .",
    "this means that minimax and maximin strategies of each of the players coincide . but",
    "this in general does _ not _ extend to non - zero - sum games .",
    "this is exactly the situation in our game .",
    "it is easy to see that the minimax strategy of the picker is simply to uniformly randomize over the _",

    "however , this completely ignores the cost of choosing costly secrets . as we will show , the maximin strategy of the picker is in general different from uniform randomization over the entire set of secrets .",

    "also the distinction between the maximin and minimax strategies can be observed .",
    "specifically , if the guesser is on the ( pessimistic ) belief that the picker is trying to hurt his utility the most ( or equivalently plan according to the `` worst case scenario '' of the strategy of the picker irrespective of her rationality ) , he should select his @xmath24 guesses uniformly randomly over the entire set of secrets .",

    "although these behaviors can be explicitly associated with deliberate randomization or through the use of randomization devices ( e.g. when a random key generator algorithm is used ) , these are not the only way such equilibria can be interpreted . without going to the details @xcite , we just mention some of the alternative interpretations equilibrium solution involving mixed strategies .",
    "namely , the probabilities can represent ( a )  time averages of player s behavior that exploit an `` adaptive '' process , ( b )  fractions of the total `` population '' of each player that adopt pure strategies , ( c )  limits of pure strategy bayesian equilibria where each player is slightly uncertain about the payoffs of the others , and",

    "there are multiple paths available and the user s objective is to use this path diversity to minimize the risk of being intercepted on a path by an adversary .",

    "another line of research from theoretical game theory is search theory and search games @xcite .",
    "existence of user preferences over the secrets to pick from is missing from such models",
    ". however , such preferences are at the heart of usability - security trade - off settings investigated in our paper .",
    "we developed tractable game - theoretic models that capture the essence of secret picking vs guessing attacks in the presence of preferences over the secret space .",
    "we then provided a full analysis of our models with the aim of investigating fundamental trends and properties in the design of secret - picking policies that attain optimal trade - offs between usability and security , taking into account the exploitation of the knowledge of such trade - offs by an adversary .",
    "notably , we computed the secret picking policies that are optimal with respect to a range of strategic metrics ( maximin , minimax , nash equilibria , stackelberg equilibria ) .",
    "we distinguished between two classes of guessing attacks : those in which the number of available guesses to an adversary is capped ( capped - guesses ) , and those in which an adversary has potentially unlimited number of tries but incurs a cost per each guess ( costly - guesses ) .",
    "our analysis revealed the crucial role that such distinction between the nature of the guessing adversary plays on the expected outcome .",
    "specifically , we showed that in the capped - guesses settings , the ne strategy of the secret picker is still uniform but over a low - cost subset of the secret space , where the size of the subset depends on the parameters of the adversary only through the number of available guesses .",
    "in contrast , we established that for costly - guesses scenarios , except for trivial cases , ne fails to attain a desirable outcome for the secret picker . for this setting , we showed how deterrence of adversaries as her optimal strategy crucially depend on existence of a credible commitment to a randomization strategy .",

    ".    moreover , in this paper , we assumed that once the secret is selected , the picker does not get to change it later , either as a blind ( open - loop ) policy or as a reaction to some signal generated by the actions of an adversary . note that if the act of changing the secret does not bring any cost to the picker , and both parties are aware of secret - changing occasions , then our results are still applicable , since in essence",
    ", the two players play the same game after each reset .",
    "however , the previous choices of the picker may affect her future utilities , and hence the whole game .",
    "for instance , the act of changing the secret may be costly for the picker , or changing the secret only slightly may be associated with less cost than changing it drastically . in such scenarios ,",
    "a rational adversary can exploit such preferences and carry some useful information from each round of the game to boost his overall attack .",
    "investigation of such scenarios using dynamic game theory is a potential extension of our work .",
    "another interesting scenario to investigate is when the picker is choosing multiple secrets , where there is a increasing loss for the number of secrets guessed correctly by an adversary .",

    "* second step : * the `` nash '' property : given the strategy of the picker , the guesser plays his best response , and vice versa .",

    "therefore , @xmath383 .",
    "again , from lemma  [ lem : ne_is_maximin ] , this also shows @xmath384 , completing the proof .",
    "the proof is straightforward following similar arguments in the proof of corollary  [ corr : sse_ne_equivalence ] : in our game , we have that for any @xmath385 , any @xmath386 also satisfies @xmath387 .",
    "hence , for any sse strategy @xmath388 , we have : @xmath389 .",
    "first , note that from lemma  [ lem : ne_is_maximin ] , the picker s ne strategy as given by proposition  [ prop : ne ] is also a minimax strategy , yielding @xmath390 for `` ordinary '' cases .",
    "we show that any deviation from @xmath289 , denote it by @xmath297 will not be a maximin strategy , and hence , can not be a ne strategy of the picker .",
    "as in the proof of proposition  [ prop : ne ] , we have : @xmath391 . following the definition of @xmath140 in , and for non - degenerate cases , we thus have : @xmath392 .",
    "hence , @xmath297 can not be a maximin strategy of the picker , and thus , following lemma  [ lem : ne_is_maximin ] , neither is it a ne strategy of hers .",
    "this establishes the necessity of the conditions in proposition  [ prop : ne ] for the ne strategy of the picker .",
    "a game of costly - guesses is in essence a sequential game .",
    "the picker makes the first move as her only turn , which is a choice of her secret from @xmath2 .",
    "the next moves are only made by the guesser .",
    "the set of available actions to the guesser at any step is a guess of the secret , plus the option to _ quit _ the search .",
    "the most natural way of modeling sequential games is the _ extensive form _ representation , i.e. , with a game tree .",
    "a history of the game is hence a sequence composed of the secret chosen by the picker , along with the sequence of the attempts of the guesser , as long as the guesser has not quited or has not made a correct guess .",
    "the game is finite , since , even if the guesser never quits , the secret is bound to be found in finite number of steps .",
    "the guesser of course does not observe the action of the picker at the first step , hence , we are dealing with an extensive game with _ imperfect information _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 11 , 12 ) .",
    "note , however , that our game is one with _",
    "complete information _ , since both players are assumed to know about the utilities and choices of each other .",
    "the ambiguity of the guesser at different steps can be captured by his _",
    "information sets_. the information set of a player whose turn is up is a set of past histories that he is ambiguous about having happened .",
    "we assume _ perfect recall _ , which in our game means the guesser remembers all of his past guesses .",
    "then , based on his past guesses , the guesser can not refute histories in which the secret of the picker is anything other than the guesses so far ( without making any inferences on the choice of the picker ) .",
    "this is because all that a failed guess reveals is that the secret is not that guess , hence the picker s secret can be anywhere in the unexplored region .    without commitment , a pure strategy of the picker",
    "is just her pure action : @xmath1 .",
    "a pure strategy of the guesser , is a function that assigns admissible actions to each of his information sets . in our game ,",
    "the information sets of the guesser can be fully determined by his past actions .",
    "this is because the picker makes a move only once that is at the beginning , and that is unobserved by the guesser .",
    "note that the sequence of past actions of the guesser can not include `` quitting '' since the search had stopped at that point ( the game had reached a terminal node ) .",
    "also , we can safely ignore strategies that involve trying a guess more than once , since they are strictly dominated by removing those multiple tries of the same guess .",
    "moreover , in any extensive form game , a strategy of a player need not determine actions for information sets that are not reachable given a player s _ own _ earlier actions in that strategy , since such assignments are irrelevant .",
    "specifically , irrespective of the strategy of other players , such information sets are never reached and that plan of action is never called upon . therefore , all strategies that assign arbitrary actions to such information sets can be lumped together and represented by one equivalent strategy , as they all represent the same meaningful plan of action .",
    "these are sometimes referred to as _ reduced _ pure strategies . in our game , in particular , a guesser s strategy that tries @xmath175 as a first guess does not need to specify an action for the information set corresponding to a failed try of @xmath176 as the first guess .",
    "hence , a pure strategy of the guesser can be represented as a sequence of unique secrets from @xmath2 .",
    "specifically , a pure strategy @xmath188 is equivalent to : @xmath393 , where @xmath394 represents the information set corresponding to the following partition of game history : @xmath395 . note",
    "the difference between a strategy profile , and an _ outcome _ of the game : a strategy profile must provide a plan of action ( a prescription ) if any information set is reached , even if those information sets are never in fact reached given the strategy of the others .",
    "for instance , if the picker chooses @xmath175 , and the guesser tries @xmath175 as his first attempt , the strategy of the guesser still needs to specify what he would have picked if his first try would have failed .",
    "we start by establishing a basic lemma .",
    "the lemma sheds light on the nature of a best response of the guesser , given a mixed strategy of the picker .",
    "specifically , it provides three ways of improving ( though not necessarily strictly ) a given ( pure ) strategy of the guesser .",

    "2 .   replacement : if @xmath405 and @xmath406 , and @xmath400 , then @xmath407 , where @xmath402 is the pure strategy that is derived from replacing @xmath204 with @xmath403 in @xmath26 and keeping everything else the same .",
    "the inequality is strict if and only if @xmath404 .",
    "padding : for a given @xmath62 , if @xmath408 where @xmath26 coincides with @xmath402 by removing @xmath409 from it , and @xmath410 , then @xmath411 , where @xmath412 coincides with @xmath26 by removing @xmath413 from it .",
    "the inequality is strict if @xmath414 . in words ,",
    "if it is beneficial for the guesser to start exploring a batch of secrets with the same probability of selection by the picker , then it is even better to explore a step further through that batch ( and by repeating the argument , continue through to explore all of that batch ) .",
    "each of the above follows directly from the expression of the expected utility of the guesser as expressed in .",
    "specifically , for part ( a ) , we have : @xmath415 for part ( b ) we have : @xmath416 finally , for part ( c ) , consider @xmath417 , @xmath418 , and @xmath419 . simplification of @xmath420 leads to @xmath421\\geq 0 $ ] . since @xmath422 ,",

    "since @xmath111 is the maximin utility of the picker ( by simply choosing from the cheapest partition ) , violation of ( b ) means : @xmath595 let @xmath26 be a best response of the guesser to @xmath289 . as we argued before , either @xmath427 or @xmath596 , i.e. , @xmath597 for a @xmath598 , where @xmath599 for all @xmath600 .",

    "the fact that @xmath611 is a best response to @xmath289 implies that it should yield the guesser at least as much utility ( or better ) than any alternative strategy .",
    "in particular , we must have @xmath612 for all @xmath613 , where @xmath614 for all @xmath615 . from",
    ", we can write : @xmath616 therefore , we must have @xmath617 or @xmath618 for all @xmath619 .",
    "the former means that this best response of the guesser explores the entire support of @xmath289 .",
    "recall that in sse , the follower ( guesser ) breaks the ties among his best responses in favor of the leader ( picker ) .",
    "hence , if there was any other best response of the guesser that partially explores the @xmath620 ( or does not explore it at all ) , then @xmath611 could not be in @xmath621 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath622 , which is contradicting  .    on the other hand , @xmath618 for all @xmath619",
    "implies that @xmath623 is just @xmath185 with probability one . to see this , note that @xmath378 preserves the order of probabilities across partitions @xmath624 and is zero over partitions @xmath625 .",
    "hence , following lemma  [ lem : seeking_path_improvement ] as before , any @xmath626 can be written as @xmath627 for a @xmath628 , in which @xmath599 for all @xmath6 .",
    "the utility of the guesser to any of such strategies is non - positive .",
    "we also have @xmath629 .",
    "hence , @xmath630 . moreover , since in a sse , the follower breaks ties in favor of the leader , there is no other strategy in the support of @xmath623 , since any other strategy of the guesser involves exploring a subset of the support of @xmath378 , which strictly reduces the utility of the picker .",
    "therefore : @xmath631 we show that @xmath632 , contradicting the assumption that @xmath289 is a sse strategy of the picker .",
    "first , because @xmath633 , and since the guesser breaks his ties in favor of the picker , any strategy in @xmath621 explores the whole partitions of @xmath625 as well . hence : @xmath634 we can expand : @xmath635 as @xmath636 . for the first term , we have : @xmath637 .",

    "this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "the lemma establishes that a sse strategy of the picker is the `` cheapest '' randomization of her that removes any `` strict '' preference of the guesser to enter the game ( if the guesser is indifferent whether to enter the game it is assumed that he does not , since he breaks ties in favor of the picker in any sse ) .",
    "next , we show that the picker can restrict her search for the cheapest deterring randomizations to only among those that assign the same probability within a partition of the same cost ( i.e. , same probability to all members of a given @xmath43 ) . to see this ,",
    "suppose an optimal distribution @xmath289 indeed violates this property .",
    "consider an @xmath643 over which , the distribution is assigning distinct probabilities , i.e. , @xmath644 where @xmath645 .",

    "now , from the relation in   we have : @xmath661 the same can be written for @xmath660 : @xmath662 note that @xmath663 and @xmath664 . moreover , since @xmath665 , from lemma  [ lem : uniform_the_worst ] , we have : @xmath666 .",
    "hence , overall , we have : @xmath667 . finally , for any strategy of the guesser that includes from @xmath654 , @xmath656 and @xmath668 , following the same argument",
