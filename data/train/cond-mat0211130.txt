    "our numerical solution for photoexcitation close to the ll1 energy with @xmath328 circularly polarized light suggests new experimental signatures of collective and correlation effects . in this case",
    "the relevant 2deg collective excitations are the long  lived inter  ll magnetoplasmons , which dress the photoexcited magnetoexcitons and lead to polaronic  like effects and strong non ",

    "we showed that such effects dominate the time delay and frequency dependence of the transient fwm spectrum .",
    "fwm spectroscopy using femtosecond optical pulses provides both the time and the frequency resolution necessary to access this new regime of 2deg physics .",
    "our theory allowed us to study in a systematic way the experimental signatures of the 2deg quantum dynamics .",
    "we predicted , in particular , a resonant enhancement of the lowest ll fwm signal , a strong dephasing of the next ll magnetoexciton , a symmetric fwm temporal profile , and strong oscillations as function of time delay with a strong quantum kinetic contribution .",
    "such predicitions agree with recent experimental data.@xcite    the above correlation  induced dynamics can be controlled by tuning the central frequency of the optical excitation between the two lowest lls , which changes the coherent admixture of the two mp  dressed magnetoexcitons , or via coherent control experiments using phase locked optical pulses .",
