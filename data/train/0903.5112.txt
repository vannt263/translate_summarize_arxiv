    "when suspended in a liquid , rodlike molecules and particles transition from an isotropic , disordered state to an aligned , liquid - crystalline nematic state at sufficiently high concentration .",
    "this classical , peculiar behavior has generated numerous theories for predicting the isotropic - nematic transition and the equilibrium properties of the coexisting phases ; typically , these theories treat the rodlike molecule or particle as an idealized brownian rigid rod of high aspect ratio .",
    "these theories capture with some success the behavior of classical lyotropic liquid - crystalline materials such as liquid crystalline polymer solutions and rodlike biological particles in water @xcite .",
    "however , previous theoretical studies fail to describe dispersions of novel anisotropic nanomaterials such as single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) .  here",
    "we extend the theoretical description of polydisperse brownian rods to include the competition of short - range repulsion and long - range attraction that is known to yield rich behavior in colloidal phases .",
    "we focus on the coexistence between the isotropic and nematic phases .      in 1949 , onsager developed a statistical mechanical theory for the rod orientation distribution function in order to describe the phase behavior of idealized monodisperse rods interacting via a mean field excluded - volume potential in an athermal solvent @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the competition between the orientational entropic contribution to the free energy and the excluded - volume potential .",
    "this competition gives rise to the isotropic - nematic phase transition that is characteristic of many rodlike molecules .",
    "as rods crowd beyond a critical concentration , alignment occurs spontaneously because orientational ordering is accompanied by a loss of interaction free energy which offsets the partial gain of free energy due to loss in orientational entropy .",
    "the predicted coexistence of an isotropic phase and an aligned phase is observed in experimental systems .",
    "onsager s original formulation was numerically refined by kayser and ravech @xcite and lekkerkerker _ et al _",
    "later studies extended onsager s approach to nonhomogeneous systems in order to resolve the profile of the interface between bulk isotropic and nematic regions @xcite and finite - sized regions @xcite .",
    "onsager s approach was also modified to include attractive interactions via a simple order - parameter - based attractive potential by khokhlov and semenov @xcite ; khokhlov and semenov used the parsons scaling approximation to allow onsager s second virial coefficient truncation to remain valid up to the high concentrations that result from the attractive potential .",
    "the major competing theoretical framework for rigid rod phase behavior is flory s lattice - based theory @xcite , which accounts for excluded - volume interactions via packing effects and allows for attractive inter - particle interactions governed by the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "flory s predictions for the boundaries of the well - known biphasic chimney for an athermal solvent ( @xmath1 ) are slightly higher ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) than the onsager predictions ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the rod diameter and length , respectively .  as the attractive force increases , the biphasic region broadens and the concentration of the coexisting aligned phase grows dramatically such that the coexistence nematic phase is a solid .",
    "( the onsager - based results of khokhlov lcinpolymers , semenov1985 show a similar broadening effect . )",
    "the lattice - based flory theory allows for great versatility in describing a variety of systems , including mixtures and various types of molecules .",
    "flory and others used the lattice framework to extend models to semiflexible rods @xcite , mixtures of rods and flexible coils flory1978_5 , rods connected by flexible linkers @xcite , rods with flexible side chains @xcite , and , most relevant to the present study , polydisperse rods @xcite .",
    "however , the myriad numerical approximations inherent in flory s treatment have limited the quantitative applications of the theory to anisotropic nanoparticles @xcite , particularly those that interact differently at long and short ranges .",
    "moreover , the attractive  interactions in flory s theory simply indicate the enthalpy of mixing .  in a poor solvent ,",
    "the rods tend to attract  one another simply because of the poor compatibility between rod and solvent .",
    "this attraction only acts on molecules immediately bordering the rod in the lattice , i.e. , at short ranges .",
    "there have been an number of other efforts to describe attractive interactions between rods .",
    "a number of studies have focused on depletion forces caused by non - adsorbing polymers in solution with the rods .",
    "et al . _ modeled the effects of adsorption in a flory - like framework @xcite , while bolhuis _",
    "used particle - based simulations to simulate spherocylinders with depletion forces caused by the addition of nonadsorbing polymer @xcite .",
    "borukhov _ et al .",
    "_ studied attractive depletion forces caused by cross - linkers in the context of stiff biopolymers in aligned phases @xcite .",
    "particle - based simulations have also been used to simulate the phase behavior of rigid rods , usually described as ellipsoids , but these simulations are typically restricted to finite aspect ratio @xcite .",
    "the free energy of these systems are computed via monte carlo methods .",
    "such simulations have been used to simulate the behavior of short aspect ratio spherocylinders interacting through attractive temperature - dependent square - well potentials @xcite .",
    "because of the shorter aspect ratio and the importance of temperature , these types of simulations are often applied to alkanes @xcite , far smaller than liquid - crystalline polymers or nanotubes ; these simulations have also detected the existence of a nematic - liquid - vapor triple point for these shorter spherocylinders @xcite .",
    "particle - based simulations provide a useful means of evaluating approximations in onsager - type frameworks ; for instance , samborski _ et al _ used monte  carlo simulations as a point of comparison for various techniques of computing higher order virial coefficients for the onsager theory @xcite .      in a system of rods",
    ", length polydispersity broadens the biphasic region , and long rods preferentially enter the nematic phase , as intuited by onsager .",
    "moreover , the coexisting isotropic and nematic concentrations depend strongly on the initial ( or parent ) concentration of rods .  in a solution of monodisperse rods ,",
    "these coexistence concentrations are independent of the parent concentration ; in a solution of polydisperse rods , the increased degree of freedom in the length - dimension yields much richer phase behavior .",
    "initial studies of polydispersity focused on long / short rod mixtures @xcite  and thick / thin rod mixtures @xcite .",
    "simple bidispersity in length or diameter can have important effects , including the formation of non - monotonic density profiles at the interface @xcite .",
    "three papers in 2003 rigorously analyzed the effects of polydispersity for continuous distributions of rigid rods .",
    "speranza and sollich computed the coexistence concentrations of a system of onsager rods with continuous polydispersity in length @xcite , and they paid special attention to the effects of the longest rods in the distribution .",
    "wensink and vroege introduced an approximation for the excluded volume interaction and systematically computed the biphasic boundaries as a function of the initial concentration and the degree of polydispersity @xcite .",
    "notably , they found that , as polydispersity increases , the isotropic boundary moves to lower concentrations , and the nematic boundary shifts to dramatically higher ones , broadening the biphasic region .",
    "these three studies also identified specific scenarios where a triphasic ( isotropic , short rod nematic , long rod nematic ) equilibrium state can occur .",
    "although the numerical analysis in @xcite was limited to two forms of the parent population with varying polydispersity , the theory applies to systems described by any rod length distribution .",
    "these studies of polydisperse rod systems were limited to athermal solvents ; here we aim to extend this work to include the effect of long - range attraction combined with short - range repulsion .",
    "the present study is motivated by recent experimental results on the phase behavior of single - walled nanotubes  ( swnts )  dispersed in superacids , such as fuming sulfuric acid and chlorosulfonic acid @xcite .  since iijima _",
    "et al _ s observation of swnts in 1993 @xcite , swnts have attracted great interest because of their unique electronic and mechanical properties @xcite ; much current research is devoted to the creation of neat swnt macroscopic articles with properties comparable to the constituent swnts .",
    "however , the production of such macroscopic articles has been hindered by the difficulty of dispersing swnts as individual rods .",
    "the dispersion of swnts is difficult because they tend to bundle tightly due to strong van der waals attraction to each other .",
    "few solvents disperse pristine swnts as individual rods capable of forming a concentrated liquid - crystalline phase .",
    "swnts can form a liquid crystalline solution in water when wrapped or stabilized by acids containing hydrophobic groups such as dna or hyaluronic acid @xcite or when trapped in hydrogels @xcite .",
    "superacids , such as fuming sulfuric acid and chlorosulfonic acid , are the only fluids that spontaneously disperse swnts as individual rods in a concentrated liquid crystalline state @xcite .",
    "superacids protonate the sidewalls of swnts and cause electrostatic repulsion and debundling @xcite .",
    "these liquid crystalline dopes have been used for the production of macroscopic swnt articles @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , in superacids weaker than ( roughly ) equimolar mixtures of sulfuric and chlorosulfonic acids , liquid - crystalline domains are in equilibrium with a dilute isotropic phase .",
    "these liquid - crystalline domains are long , threadlike structures , termed swnt spaghetti ,  composed by a myriad of aligned swnts spaced by a few swnt diameters .  the swnts can translate along the axis of the strand , but have very limited mobility in the normal direction .  this unusual phase behavior can not be described by the onsager or flory theories for monodisperse rods because the swnts are polydisperse and because the theories can not accurately describe the effects of varying acid strength on the inter - rod interactions .",
    "in fact , the broadening of the biphasic chimney occurs on the isotropic side rather than the nematic side , contrary to flory s predictions .    modeling",
    "the phase behavior of such systems would involve both electrostatic forces due to protonation and inter - swnt van der waals attraction .",
    "the balance of electrostatic repulsive interactions and van der waals attractive interactions for dilute polyelectrolyte colloids have been modeled using the derjaguin , landau , verwey , and overbeek ( dlvo ) theory @xcite .",
    "the dlvo approach was generalized for interactions between charged anisotropic macromolecules by chapot _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the dlvo  approach has been applied to a number of experiments on aqueous suspensions of charged rods such as v@xmath8o@xmath9 gels @xcite and b - feooh @xcite .",
    "dlvo and similar theories can not be applied to rods in superacids because the assumption of dilute electrolytes inherent in the dlvo theory are inapplicable .",
    "we postulate that the key physical mechanism controlling the behavior of swnts in acids is the competition between long - range van der waals attraction , which is weakly dependent on acid strength , and short - range electrostatic repulsion , which depends strongly on acid strength  as shown clearly by raman spectroscopy of swnts in acids .",
    "we approximate this competition through a simple inter - rod repulsive - attractive potential , where strength of the attractive well varies with solvent quality .",
    "the rods interact through an attractive force that varies inversely with acid strength ; this attractive force mimics van der waals interactions offset to varying degrees by electrostatic repulsion as a function of protonation .",
    "our formulation follows that of wensink and vroege and includes an additional potential to capture the effect of attractive interparticle interactions and solvent effects @xcite .",

    "3  for @xmath105 is similar to the classic flory theory @xcite and the khokhlov extension of the onsager theory @xcite because the biphasic region primarily broadens by increasing the concentration of the nematic cloud curve @xmath74 toward the maximum packing fraction ( 0.907 ) as the solvent quality decreases .  in all these previous studies ,",
    "the nematic concentration rapidly increases to a solid - like state because short - range repulsion is not included in the model .",

    "et al__.    most interestingly , the isotropic cloud curve diverges to very small values at a critical value of @xmath113 .  because @xmath114 , the quantity @xmath115  will become more and more negative as the attractive force in the nematic phase increases .  therefore in systems where attractive interactions are stronger than this critical value , the dilute , isotropic phase must always coexist with some liquid - crystalline phase .  even at very small concentrations , the system is still in the biphasic regime ; thus , some rods will form an aligned phase at equilibrium due to the strong attraction .",
    "a similar result was found by speranza and sollich ; for distributions with small amounts of extremely long rods , the cloud curve decreased to vanishingly small concentrations @xcite .",
    "this holds great import for experimental studies of rod dispersions , as discussed below .",
    "as polydispersity decreases , the isotropic cloud curves move down to lower well depths and to the right to higher rod concentration ; this is to be expected since the effects of length fractionation decrease as polydispersity decreases .",
    "this also means that @xmath116 decreases as a function of @xmath88 ; this holds practical import for experimental scenarios where an isotropic solution is desired .",
    "if a particular solvent / rod combination corresponds to a value of @xmath70 that is less than @xmath116 , then even dilute solutions will be in the biphasic regime .",
    "if the polydispersity of the solution can be decreased and/or the average length increased , then the value of @xmath117 will also decrease ; thus , polydispersity can be used as a control to ensure that @xmath118 .",
    "as polydispersity decreases , the nematic cloud curve moves down to lower well depths and to the left to lower rod concentration .  for low @xmath88 ,",
    "the nematic cloud curve is a much weaker function of acid strength than the isotropic cloud curve .",
    "thus , for broad distributions ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) , the nematic cloud curve varies more rapidly than the isotropic cloud curve while for narrow distributions ( e.g. , @xmath119 ) the opposite is true .",
    "note that in the monodisperse case , the nematic cloud curve actually decreases with the attractive well becomes stronger ; this differs from the polydisperse case because the attractive well amplifies the effects of polydispersity and broadens the biphasic region .      in previous papers , we used a series of experiments to establish a phase diagram for swnt / acid mixtures @xcite which is displayed in figure 6 .",
    "various swnt / acid mixtures at a given swnt concentration ( denoted by diamonds in figure 6 ) are centrifuged into isotropic and nematic phases , and the concentration @xmath120 of the isotropic phase is measured and marked as black circles .",

    "in contrast with the predictions of flory - like theories , the dilute isotropic phase in poor solvents coexists with a concentrated liquid - crystalline phase ( @xmath121 )  rather than with a solid phase ( i.e. , @xmath122 ) .    in order to compare the theoretical results with experimental results for swnts in superacids ,",
    "a relationship between @xmath70  and acid strength must be posited .",
    "superacid strength is typically measured in terms ofbase - specific hammett acidity @xcite .  in the case of swnt / superacid systems , acid strength",

    "( this quantity varies linearly with the wavenumber shift , @xmath123 , of the g - peak in the swnt raman spectra . )",
    "the van der waals forces should be roughly independent of acid strength .  however , as the degree of protonation increases , the repulsion effect increases .",
    "thus , @xmath70 , which represents the sum of the van der waals forces and the repulsive forces , becomes shallower as acid strength increases .",
    "we approximate the dependence of the repulsive force on the acid strength by positing a simple linear relationship between @xmath123  and the attractive well depth @xmath70  by comparing the theoretical and experimental results for the isotropic concentration after phase separation . , and these factors may vary from one swnt sample to another .",
    "@xmath70 is independent of swnt length and polydispersity , but experiments indicate that the solubility of a hipco swnt sample in a given acid varies with diameter distribution , the frequency of defects in the swnt sidewalls , and the chemical effects of the oxidation and purification process on the swnt sidewalls . ]",
    "experimental measurements for the strongest acid used ( chlorosulfonic acid ) indicate that @xmath120 is approximately equal to the theoretical predictions for athermal ( onsager ) rods ; thus , we match a raman shift of @xmath124 to @xmath106 .  the theoretical predictions for @xmath125 for",

    "the model ( red open circles ) is remarkably successful at predicting the experimental values @xmath120 ( black circles ) at low concentrations @xcite .",

    "experimental measurements indicate a nematic cloud point of @xmath121 that is relatively constant with respect to acid strength ; however , the theoretical results indicate a slightly constant value of @xmath131 .  unlike the case of low - concentration phase separation , the theoretical and experimental values for the nematic cloud curve do not match .",
    "however , further analysis of the theoretical results reveals why the values differ .  in fig .",
    "8 , the theory predicts that @xmath132 for a system where @xmath133 , i.e. , @xmath134 of the system ( by volume )  is nematic .",
    "the remaining @xmath135 is isotropic and comprised of relatively short rods , as shown in fig .",
    "8 .  in an experiment , these short - rod - dominated isotropic",
    "regions would be found primarily in the defects between liquid - crystalline domains , and these small isotropic regions would be nearly undetectable by optical microscopy , rheology , or dynamic scanning calorimetry .  thus , the experimental points are best taken as measurements of the transition to a system that is @xmath134 liquid crystalline by volume , and we may take the theoretical prediction of the nematic cloud point as correct .",
    "the theory predicts that the starting concentration must be pushed up to @xmath136 to completely eliminate these isotropic regions .",
    "however , simulation results also indicate that if all of the rods with an aspect ratio under @xmath137 are removed , then the nematic cloud curve decreases below @xmath138 .  and @xmath130  where this is possible .",
    "]      the computational results show that a liquid - crystalline phase will always be present for acids with @xmath139 ( @xmath140 , where @xmath141 , equivalent to an acid mixture with a 9:16 volume ratio of clso@xmath128h to h@xmath8so@xmath127 ) , regardless of the starting swnt concentration .",
    "this means that in order to get a dilute , isotropic suspension of individual swnts in superacid , the solution must first be centrifuged and phase separated in order to remove the isotropic phase from the nematic phase .",
    "a number of cnt characterization techniques ( such as rheological characterization of cnt length @xcite ) require a dilute , isotropic suspension , and these counterintuitive computational results show that a simple low - concentration dispersion of swnts in 120% h@xmath8so@xmath127 will not yield a dilute , isotropic solution .",
    "the isotropic cloud curve can be moved down to lower well depths and to the right to higher rod concentrations by eliminating the longest swnts in a given sample ; this would be useful for applications requiring a dilute , isotropic solution and could be accomplished via a number of experimental techniques .",
    "also , one of the chief applications of swnt / superacid dispersions is the formation of aligned articles such as fibers and films ericson , davisscience ; our computational results have immediate applications for the processing of such articles .",
    "the fiber spinning process works as follows :  high - concentration , liquid - crystalline swnt / superacid dispersions are mixed , and extruded .",
    "the viscous dispersion becomes more aligned due to the tension on the fluid during extensional flow .",
    "finally , the dispersion is coagulated in a non - solvent bath where the acid is removed , and the swnt dispersion solidifies to form an aligned fiber .",
    "the best fibers are produced by dispersions that are highly aligned and fully liquid - crystalline , i.e. , above the nematic cloud curve .",
    "any isotropic regions in the dispersions form misaligned , weak regions in the final fiber ; these defects decrease the electrical properties and are the primary points of fiber mechanical failure .",
    "( note that defects that are predominantly composed of small nanotubes have already been observed for liquid - crystalline mwnt systems @xcite . )    with this application in mind , the theoretical framework outlined above can be used to locate the true nematic cloud curve in order to ensure that the dispersion is fully liquid crystalline .  in this case",
    ", the cloud curve concentration may be too high for practical mixing and fiber spinning , so the theoretical framework can also be used to test the results of manipulating the starting swnt length distribution in order to decrease the nematic cloud concentration .  in this case",

    "also , fractionating a sample in the biphasic regime in a weaker superacid ( such as 102% h@xmath8so@xmath127 ) and removing the isotropic phase can be used to eliminate the shortest swnts . ]",
    "also , this theoretical framework has implications for high - concentration rheology of swnt dispersions .  the dependence of viscosity on concentration is a well - known experimental test for liquid - crystallinity ; the viscosity increases , goes through a maximum , decreases due to the formation of a liquid - crystalline phase , and finally begins to increase again at high concentrations @xcite .",
    "this dependence on concentration is blurred and weakened as the biphasic chimney is broadened because the formation of aligned phase occurs over a much wider concentration range .",
    "swnt / superacid dispersions with weaker acids or polydisperse length distributions will show a weak dependence of viscosity on concentration and may not show the maximum / minimum signature of liquid - crystallinity .",
    "decreasing polydispersity or strengthening the acid solvent will sharpen and amplify the difference between the maximum and minimum in viscosity .",
    "the utility of the theoretical treatment outlined in this study is evident from the unexpected nature of the results .",
    "optical microscopy experiments and dsc could not detect the isotropic regions in the swnt / superacid dispersions used for fiber spinning at @xmath143 , but the theory predicts that these regions are indeed present ; such regions have adverse effects on as - spun fibers .  also , it is entirely intuitive to reason that a dilute solution of swnts in 120% h@xmath8so@xmath127 would be dispersed as isotropic individuals , but the theory predicts that even these low concentrations are within the biphasic region because of attractive interactions .",
    "we expect that this analysis will pave the way for the modeling of other anisotropic materials such as multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( mwnts ) or inorganic nanorods .",
    "the phase behavior of cdse nanorods cdse - phasediagram has been assessed through purely qualitative means , and an effective theoretical framework for understanding these materials is needed .",
    "the phase transitions for solutions of polydisperse functionalized mwnts were qualitatively characterized by song and windle @xcite .",
    "a theoretical analysis of these systems may allow a more quantitative understanding of these dispersed nanomaterials .",
    "we have developed an extension to the onsager theory for polydisperse rigid rods developed by wensink and vroege in order to capture the balance of long - range attractive and repulsive forces observed for anisotropic nanomaterials in solution .",
    "our work is particularly motivated by the recent quantitative experimental data for swnts dispersed as individual rigid rods in superacids .",
    "our results indicate excellent agreement between the theory and experimental data for predicting phase separation at low concentrations and for predicting the biphasic chimney s broadening on the isotropic side .",
    "the theoretical results also hold important and surprising implications for a variety of swnt / superacid experiments and applications , including the understanding of swnt / superacid rheology and the processing of fibers and films from liquid crystalline dopes .",

    "two  useful but oft - misunderstood concepts for delineating the phase behavior of polydisperse rod populations are the cloud phase and shadow phase",
    ".  for example , at small concentrations , a parent population of polydisperse rods in an athermal solvent will remain isotropic with no phase separation .  as the parent concentration @xmath57",
    "is increased , a point is reached where an infinitesimal volume of nematic phase , termed a shadow phase ,  forms while the vast majority of the parent population remains in the cloud  isotropic phase .",
    "thus , the shadow nematic phase coexists with the cloud isotropic phase , and the corresponding value of @xmath57  represents the lowest value of @xmath57  at which coexistence is possible .",
    "the converse is true on the high - concentration side of the phase diagram ; the shadow isotropic phase coexists with the cloud nematic phase , and the corresponding value of @xmath57represents the highest value of @xmath57  at which coexistence is possible .  on the isotropic cloud curve , the quantity @xmath54 ( the fraction of the system that is nematic ) will approach zero , while on the nematic cloud curve , @xmath54 will approach one .",
    "the isotropic and nematic cloud phases are the ultimate boundaries of the biphasic region in a system of polydisperse rods .",
    "parent populations within the biphasic region will phase separate into coexisting isotropic and nematic phases , and the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 will vary with @xmath57 .",

    "illustration , which depicts the dependence of @xmath83 and @xmath84 on @xmath57 .",
    "note that the daughter phases appear to remain in the biphasic regime which suggests that they are not an equilibrium solution ; this paradox is resolved by the fact that the daughters have a different length distribution than the parent phase , such that the daughter phases lie outside the cloud curves for their specific distribution .",
    "figure 1 :  ( i ) the combination of short range electrostatic repulsive forces ( shown in blue ) and van der waals attraction will result in an attractive well ( shown in red ) potential between the two particles .",
    "however , the exact form of these functions is unknown for complex solvent and solutes such as superacids and swnts .",
    "( ii ) a simple , phenomenological square well potential @xmath68  is used to capture this balance of repulsive forces and attractive forces between swnts in various acids .  as the acid quality decreases , the well becomes deeper .",
