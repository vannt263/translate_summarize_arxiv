    "1999 ; sandage 2000 ) .",
    "a dichotomy of thinking arises at this point .",
    "the theorists say that a one - parameter brightness / decline rate relation can not be the whole story .",
    "theory suggests appreciable variation with input parameters ( khokhlov 2000 ; hflich & dominguez 2000 ) and the observations themselves suggest departures from one - parameter relations .",
    "observers , on the other hand , point out that utilizing these one - parameter relations works remarkably well in practice in correcting for deviations ( schmidt 2000 ; perlmutter 2000 ; sandage 2000 ) .",
    "the conclusion , as emphasized by hflich & dominguez ( 2000 ) seems to be that some of the input parameters that are varied independently in the evolutionary and dynamic models  the carbon ignition density , the density of transition from subsonic deflagration to supersonic detonation ( khokhlov , oran & wheeler 1997a , b ; niemeyer & woosley 1997 ; khokhlov 2000 ) , rotation , progenitor mass , progenitor metallicity  must be correlated in ways we have yet to elucidate .    to make progress",

    "the value of the normalized cosmological matter density derived from type ia supernovae is @xmath4 and that of the cosmological constant , @xmath5 .",

    "one is a possible new view of the universe . with a cosmological constant that might not be  constant , \"",
    "there is the potential for closed universes that expand forever or open universes that collapse .",
    "there must be a consideration of new physics to understand the microscopic origin of the vacuum energy that poses as a cosmological constant and why it is so small , but not zero , at just this epoch .",

    "\" there may be subtle systematic effects that bias the estimates of brightness of supernovae as a function of redshift and which masquerade as the effect of a cosmological constant .",
    "howell , wang & wheeler ( 1999 ) have noted that the nearby type ia that are used to calibrate the light curve decline relation are primarily discovered photographically so that they are susceptible to the  shaw effect \" of being lost near the centers of galaxies due to saturation , whereas the deep searches are done with ccds that are less susceptible to this effect .",
    "the properties of the type ia s vary with galactic radius ( wang , hflich & wheeler 1997 ; riess et al .",
    "1999a ) and the radial distributions of the calibration sample and the distant sample are distinctly different .",
    "this difference may be removed by light curve decline corrections , but such systematic effects need more study .",
    "riess et al ( 1999b , c ) report that nearby type ia might have systematically slower rise times than the cosmological events for similar decay times .",
    "suntzeff ( 1999 ) notes that the sample of events that show distinct departures from a one - parameter brightness / decline relation is real and growing and that while 6 of 40 type ia in a nearby sample are of the very bright kind , no events like sn  1991 t have been observed in the much larger deep sample .",
    "all these developments are hints of systematic effects that must be better understood , both physically and observationally . resolving this issue of the cosmological versus the mundane one way or the other will take several year s hard , slogging work by both theorists and observers in the supernova community .",

    "although it is not at all clear that it should be presented in this context , for completeness i will add the possibility that sn  1987a produced a jet of some sort , if not a .",
    "wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) , cen ( 1998 ) , and nakamura ( 1998 ) all noted that if supernovae make jets that have some connection to  there might be some relevance to the  mystery spot \" of sn  1987a .",
    "motivated by cen s comments in this connection , nisenson & papaliolios ( 1999 ) re - examined their speckle data on sn  1987a and argued in favor of both a jet and counter jet from sn  1987a . from the kinematics they concluded that the counter jet must have moved at relativistic speeds .",
    "some sort of jets might be produced in many core collapse events ( see  3 ) , but there is still debate and doubt on the reality of these jets .",
    "there is , of course , no direct link to a . on the other hand , nagataki ( 1999 )",
    "makes a convincing case that a jet - like explosion in sn  1987a can resolve many of the issues of outward mixing of radioactive elements and line profiles .",
    "the goal of producing robustly asymmetric supernovae , weak  of the sort observed in sn  1998bw / grb  980425 , and perhaps collimated high - energy bursts of  that could contribute to the cosmological  suggests the following general picture .",
    "the best chance of imprinting the asymmetry and producing some sort of  is in the absence of an extended hydrogen envelope which could slow , delay , or disperse the propagation of an asymmetric flow of energy from a newly - formed neutron star .",
    "this makes a type ib / c , and especially a type ic configuration , a likely site for study , independent of the similarities of sn  1998bw to type ic .",
    "the progenitor of a type ic is envisaged to be the core of a massive star , perhaps in excess of 15  on the main sequence , which has shed its hydrogen and helium by a winds or binary mass transfer .",
    "the iron core in such a progenitor collapses to form a neutron star , and the outer layers of si , o , and c with longer free - fall times hover momentarily .",
    "the neutron star bounces and produces a standing shock that stalls without inducing an explosion . if the neutron star is a pulsar , then it is possible to create an mhd jet up the rotational axis at the time of the formation of the neutron star as in the old calculation of leblanc & wilson ( 1970 ) .",
    "such a jet could induce the requisite asymmetry in the ejecta and accelerate in the density gradient to produce a weak .",
    "if the pulsar were very highly magnetized , a magnetar ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 ; harding 2000 ) , then the pulsar could also potentially produce an intense flux of poynting radiation ( usov 1992,1994 ; thompson 1994 ; mszros & rees 1997 ; blackman & yi 1998 ; see also ostriker & gunn 1971 ; bisnovatyi - kogan 1971 ) .",
    "this poynting flux would tend to flow out through the weakest part of the hovering mantle , namely the wound punched by the mhd jet .",
    "for very large magnetic fields , the collimation and energetics could be sufficient to produce a cosmic .",
    "this outline of a possible scenario illustrates a host of places where more rigorous physics is needed to determine whether the hypothesized outcome is reasonable .",
    "one issue is the propagation of the initial mhd jet out through the mantle and its effect on the star .",

    "this core is replaced by a point gravitational source with mass @xmath21 representing the newly formed neutron star .",
    "the remaining mass , @xmath22 , consists of an o - ne - mg inner layer surrounded by the c - o and he mantles .    the jets are assumed to enter the mantle at two polar locations at @xmath23 .",
    "an inflow with velocity @xmath24 , density @xmath25 and pressure @xmath26 is imposed .",
    "the jet parameters are chosen to represent the results of leblanc & wilson ( 1970 ) . at @xmath23 ,",
    "the jet density and pressure are the same as those of the background material , @xmath27  3 and @xmath28  ergs @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the radii of the cylindrical jets entering the computational domain are approximately @xmath29  cm .",
    "the jet velocity at @xmath23 was held constant at @xmath30  for 0.5 s. this results in a mass flux rate of @xmath31 -s with an energy deposition rate @xmath32 -s for each jet .",
    "after 0.5  s , the velocity of the jets at @xmath23 was gradually decreased to zero at approximately 1  s. the total energy deposited by the jets was @xmath33  ergs and the total mass ejected is @xmath34  grams or @xmath35 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with , but somewhat less than , those of the leblanc - wilson model .",
    "as the jets move outward , they remain collimated and do not develop much internal structure . a bow shock forms at the head of the jet and spreads in all directions , roughly cylindrically around each jet .",
    "the jet characteristic time , @xmath36  s , is much shorter than the sound crossing time of the star , @xmath37  s. the jets stay collimated enough to reach the surface as strong jets .",
    "the stellar matter is shocked by the bow shock , and acts as a high - pressure confining medium by forming a cocoon around the jet .",
    "the sound crossing time of the dense o - ne - mg envelope , @xmath38  s , is only ten times longer than @xmath39 , and the jets are capable of penetrating this dense inner part of the star in @xmath40  s. by the time the jets penetrate into the less dense c - o and he layers , the inflow of material into the jets has been turned off . by this time , however , the jets have become long bullets of high - density material moving through the background low - density material almost ballistically .",
    "the higher pressures in these jets cause them to spread laterally .",
    "this spreading is limited by a secondary shock that forms around each jet between the jet and the material already shocked by the bow shock .",
    "the radius of the jets , @xmath41 cm as they emerge from the star , is larger than the initial radius , @xmath42 cm , but it is still significantly less than the radius of the star .",
    "after about 5.9 s , the bow shock reaches the edge of the star and breaks through .",
    "figure 1 shows the subsequent evolution of the star after the breakthrough .",
    "by @xmath43  s , most of the material in the jets has left the star and will propagate into the interstellar medium ballistically .",
    "the laterally expanding bow shocks generated by the jets move toward the equator where they collide with each other .",
    "the result is that the material in the equatorial plane is compressed and accelerated more than material in other directions ( excluding the jet material ) . at @xmath44",
    "s , the equatorial flow reaches the outer edge of the star , and the star begins to settle into the free expansion regime .",
    "the computation was terminated at @xmath45  s , before free expansion was attained .",
    "the stellar ejecta at this time is highly asymmetric",
    ". the density contour of @xmath46 3 , which is the average density of the ejecta at this time , forms an oblate configuration with the equator - to - polar velocity and density ratios @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "complex shock and rarefaction interactions inside the expanding envelope will continue to change the distribution of the parameters inside the ejecta .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that the resulting configuration will resemble an oblate ellipsoid with a very high degree of asymmetry @xmath49 .",
    "the asymmetric explosion generated in this calculation provides ejection velocities that are comparable to those observed in supernovae , but with especially high velocities near the jet axis .",
    "for this particular calculation , an energy of @xmath50 ergs is input at the base of the jets .",
    "this energy is divided roughly equally between the emerging jets and the bulk of the asymmetric ejecta .",
    "the total mass in the two jets is @xmath51 and the total kinetic energy is @xmath52  ergs .",
    "the average velocity of the jets is about 25,000   .",
    "the outer 2.5  of mantle material is ejected with kinetic energy of @xmath53 ergs and average velocity @xmath54   .",
    "the jet - induced explosion is entirely due to the action of the jet on the surrounding star .",
    "the mechanism that determines the energy of such an explosion is related to the shut - off of the accretion onto the neutron star by the lateral shocks that accelerate the material outwards .",
    "the explosion thus does not depend on neutrino transport or re - acceleration of the stalled shock .",
    "the result of this calculation is a highly nonspherical supernova explosion with two high - velocity jets of material moving in polar directions and oblate , highly distorted ejecta containing most of the supernova material .",
    "this jet - induced explosion thus provides a satisfactory account of the degree of polarization and asymmetry observed for typical core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the luminosity and photospheric velocities will be a function of the aspect angle .",
    "this model gives at least the possibility of reproducing a standard type ic like sn  1994i by observations along the equator where the velocity and luminosity ( and perhaps the  flux ) will be minimum , but the polarization will be maximum , of reproducing sn  1997ef by an observation at intermediate angles , and reproducing sn  1998bw by observation near the poles ( within 35 degrees ; hflich , wheeler & wang 1999 ) where the velocity and luminosity will be maximum and the polarization a minimum , albeit with perhaps somewhat higher explosion energy .",
    "this scheme might thus account for many of the properties of these three events as outlined by branch ( 2000 ) without requiring a  hypernova \" for any of them .",
    "the jets provide a large kinetic energy per unit solid angle .",
    "when the jets break through the stellar photosphere , a small amount of mass will be accelerated down the density gradient to high velocities .",

    "( 1999 ) did not have sufficient resolution to make quantitative predictions ; however , a small fraction of the material at the stellar surface had a velocity of up to @xmath55 90,000 .",
    "there is thus a good liklihood of producing a weak and a radio outburst of the type seen in sn  1998bw / grb  980425 by the relativistic shock ejection mechanism of colgate ( 1975 ) .",

    "these issues need to be re - examined in the current context , but several things are worth noting about the meier et al .",

    "the calculation of khokhlov et al . shows this to be incorrect .",

    "based their analysis on stellar evolution calculations of the day , but they adopted a stellar core with central density of about @xmath56   3 giving a binding energy of about @xmath57 ergs .",
    "this exaggerates the binding energy of the initial core by about a factor of 10 compared to modern calculations and gives an incorrectly small value of a key parameter of meier et al . , the ratio of the binding energy of the newly - formed neutron star to that of the initial core .",
    "meier et al also did not consider the possibility of an @xmath58 dynamo that could lead to exponential growth of the magnetic field ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) .",
    "the whole question of the initiation of mhd jets in association with neutron star formation needs to be considered anew .",
    "a different mechanism of jet generation involving neutrino radiation or perhaps mhd jets during collapse of a very massive star into a black hole has been recently discussed by macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) and woosley ( 2000 ) in the context of  collapsar \" models of .",
    "the energy input rate and total energy of the jets in the calculation of macfadyen & woosley are similar to those of khokhlov et al .",

    "it is sobering to recognize that the differences between x - ray transients involving black hole accretion and classical novae involving thermonuclear explosions on the surfaces of white dwarfs were only fully recognized in the last decade or so .",

    "sn  1998bw could be an extreme version of that physics , requiring energies in the upper range for other observed supernovae , perhaps @xmath59 ergs versus @xmath60 ergs for most core collapse events and @xmath61 ergs for the well - measured sn  1987a . in this case , sn  1998bw is predicted to leave behind a neutron star , a pulsar , perhaps even a magnetar . in the other extreme of some order parameter , we have the classic cosmological  as revealed by bepposax and the sterling follow - up work that has been done in all wavelengths .",
    "these cosmic  could be  hypernovae \" involving jets originating in  collapsars \" as discussed by woosley ( 2000 ) or neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole collisions ( or the many variations on that theme ) or maybe both . in this picture , sn  1998bw might represent a mild , not so collimated or powerful version of the cosmological bursts . in this case , sn  1998bw is predicted to leave behind a black hole .",
    "clearly , sn  1998bw remains a potential rosetta stone , one of fading , but still detectable brilliance at the time of the conference .",
    "one interesting issue is the amplitude of the lorentz factor .",
    "the lorentz factor is typically limited to @xmath14 10 in both agn s and the stellar mass black hole sources with superluminal jets , the microquasars ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ; fender 1999 ) , whereas it is understood that that the lorentz factors in  must be @xmath62 100 ( baring & harding 1997 ) .",
    "what is the difference in the physics of these situations ?",
    "one factor that is thought to limit the speed of black hole jets is radiation drag by photons emitted from the surrounding disk ( sikora et al .",
    "1996 ; luo & protheroe 1999 ) .",
    "does this phenomenon , as well as baryon loading , affect the models based on black hole accretion ?",
    "has nature , through the agn and microquasars , already told us what black hole accretion does , or is the massive accretion rate postulated for  collapsar \" models sufficient to account for the difference ? do  with their exceedingly large lorentz factors require some physical basis that is very different than accreting black holes ?    in principle , either newly - born neutron stars or black holes could generate jets .",
    "how are those cases to be differentiated as we explore sn  1998bw and the other candidate  hypernova \" events .",
    "one interesting possibility is to look at the iron abundances in x - ray spectra , as discussed by piro ( 2000 ; see also mszros & rees 1998 ; piro et al .",
    "1999a ; lazzati , campana & ghisellini 1999 ; vietri et al . 1999",
    "; table 2 .",
    "note that a work widely referred to by yoshida et al .",
    "1999 , based on asca observations of grb  879828 , does not seem to have been submitted ) .",
    "another important issue to explore is the nature of the birth of a  magnetar \" with a magnetic field ranging up to perhaps @xmath63 g compared to the birth of a  normal \" pulsar with a dipole field of @xmath64 g.    the recognition that  may involve collimated flows has become widespread .",
    "there is already a debate about when and at what speed , lateral expansion of jets will occur and with what effect on the spectrum and temporal behavior of the afterglow .",
    "the question of different collimation and lorentz beaming of the and afterglow must be addressed .",
    "chevalier ( 2000 ; li & chevalier 1999 ; chevalier & li 1999 ) has emphasized the difference of afterglows propagating into density gradients as opposed to uniform density environments . in general , a spherical relativistic blast wave propagating into a density gradient will give a light curve that declines more steeply than the case of a constant density .",
    "the result is that the effects of density gradients , for instance winds with density profile @xmath65 , can mimic the effects of a collimated jet that slows and spreads in a constant density environment .",
    "in addition , prolonged energy input into the blast wave can result in a shallower light curve decline in the case with a density gradient in a manner that can mimic the effect of a spherical blast wave in a constant density medium .",
    "the luminosity of a jet could fluctuate in space and time for dynamical and kinematic reasons .",
    "if one asks about collimated flow into an environment with density gradients , even clumpiness , then the range of phenomenology could be quite great ( mszros , rees & wijers 1998 ) .",
    "these issues could be related .",
    "while relativistic blast waves propagating in a steady state wind will decelerate , those propagating through steeper profiles ( @xmath66 with n@xmath67 3 ; shapiro 1980 ) will accelerate ( colgate 1975 ; shapiro 1980 ) and the gradient itself can lead to collimation ( shapiro 1979 ) .",
    "my guess is that the full potential complexity of the behavior of collimated flow has not yet been appreciated nor evaluated .",
    "once again , while it is fading , sn  1998bw could be an important resource for raising these issues .",
    "all models for this event presuppose a stripped core of a massive star .",
    "a strong wind is the most likely candidate for the mass loss and the radio emission has already given evidence for a relativistic blast wave interacting with a @xmath65 density gradient ( li & chevalier 1999 ) .",
    "follow - up of sn  1998bw in all possible wavelengths until it is completely unobservable is strongly encouraged !",
    "finally , one of the most exciting events in a string of recent revolutions was the recording of the contemporary optical outburst associated with grb  990123 ( akerloff et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this burst was seen at 9th magnitude and kehoe ( 2000 ) emphasized that they can not guarantee having detected the peak due to their sampling !",
    "kehoe also emphasized that they have observed other events at lower limits so some , at least , are not this bright .",
    "still , some obviously are and the lesson for the rotse group and the lotis and other groups who are trying to do automated contemporary detections is to just be patient . there must be more such events .",
    "what an incredible event this single observation of grb  990123 represented . at 9th magnitude , this optical flare was almost naked eye ! one of the first things that occurred to me , somewhat facetiously , was encouraging hoards of private citizens to go out every night in their back yards with a decent pair of binoculars and look for these events .",
    "batse detects about one  per day .",
    "if every one were like grb990123 , there should be a bright optical flash for a minute or so once a day somewhere on the sky that would be easily visible with a decent pair of binoculars .",
    "a pair of binoculars allows you to see about one part in a thousand of the total sky .",
    "if you looked every night for three years running , you just might get lucky .    as it so happens , gerry fishman and janet mattei of the aavso were way ahead of me .",
    "they are already talking about working with amateurs with decent sized telescopes and commercial ccd s to undertake a project akin to joe patterson s backyard astronomy , the program he coordinates from columbia . with this kind of organization",
    "we may indeed see the era of backyard cosmology .",
    "my thanks personally and on behalf of all the attendees at the meeting for a job well done to mario livio and the scientific organizing committee , to patrick godon and rosie diaz - miller for handling the expert and neophyte power point operators as well as all the other a - v tasks , and especially to lorraine garcia and theresa bailey for their excellent work on the symposium arrangements and the myriad issues and questions that always arise during such a conference .",
