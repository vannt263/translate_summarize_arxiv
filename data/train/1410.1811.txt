    "the interaction of chiral molecules with light is sensitive to the circular polarization or helicity of the photons .",
    "one manifestation of this optical activity is circular dichroism ( cd ) , i.e. , light absorption in such material is sensitive to the handedness of the circular polarization .",
    "such interaction is enantiometrically specific and depends on the structure of the chiral matter @xcite .",
    "polarization is associated with the spin angular momentum ( sam)of light .",
    "therefore , cd effect is usually associated with spin of light . the work of allen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has shown that in addition to sam , laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beams carry well defined orbital angular momentum ( oam ) associated with its spatial mode .",
    "this has triggered new research on interaction of matter with laser beams having certain spatial profiles , like , lg or bessel profile @xcite . from extensive theoretical @xcite and experimental works",
    "@xcite it has been believed that the oam of lg beam does not play a role in cd . on the contrary , here we prove that the matter - wave vortex of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) interacting with an lg beam can lead to cd - like effects , i.e. , the light absorption becomes sensitive to the handedness of the field oam .",
    "numerous theoretical and experimental studies related to creation of matter - wave vortex states , persistent current in bec and coherent control of the oam of atoms using interaction of ultra - cold atoms with optical vortex @xcite have been reported over past two decades .",
    "quantized vortex states play an essential role in macroscopic quantum phenomena like superfluidity and superconductivity .",
    "there have been studies to detect sign of a vortex state using different techniques , like , interference between vortex states @xcite , exciting the quadrupole mode of a bec using an auxiliary laser beam as stirrer @xcite , vortex core precession @xcite , method of twisted densities @xcite , and vortex gyroscope imaging ( vgi ) @xcite .",
    "the primary difficulty of in - situ observation of vortices in trapped condensate is that the radius of a vortex core is on the order of the condensate healing length , which is generally several times smaller than the wavelength of the laser used for imaging .",
    "methods applying free expansion after extinguishing the trap or interferometric steps disrupt the time evolution irreversibly . in most of the experiments , reproducing precisely the initial condition of vortex generation is very challenging . in some methods , like , rapid quench across the bec transition during evaporation via kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) @xcite ,",
    "the vortex generation is even stochastic @xcite .",
    "so , any detection method using a fraction of the condensate @xcite or in - situ nondestructive phase - contrast imaging @xcite is always preferable to any destructive method .",
    "here we show how the cd - like effect that arises in interaction of a bec with an lg beam can be useful to detect a single vortex of bec and its handedness keeping a portion of initial bec undisturbed . in this method ,",
    "two - photon stimulated raman transitions are used only in a portion of bec that is spatially separated out from the rest of the condensate which remains trapped in its initial state .",
    "one can detect the presence and sign of the undisturbed vortex by doing measurements on the separated part . in recent experiments of @xcite ,",
    "two - photon transitions are used to transfer the oam to the atomic bec employing an lg and a gaussian beam .",
    "the mechanism of angular momentum transfer from an lg beam to ultracold atoms is studied in paraxial limit in our previous work @xcite . here",
    "we recall some of the essential features of this oam transfer mechanism .",
    "we consider an lg beam without any off - axis node propagating along @xmath0 axis of the laboratory frame interacting with @xmath1na bec whose de broglie wavelength is large enough to feel the intensity variation of lg beam but smaller than the waist of the beam . under this condition ,",
    "the dipole interaction hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the winding number and the waist of the lg beam .",
    "@xmath5 is coordinate of the valence electron with respect to center - of - mass ( c.m . ) of the atom and @xmath6 is the coordinate of the c.m . in laboratory frame of reference .",
    "rabi frequency is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes an unperturbed atomic state , @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the c.m .",
    "wavefunction that depends on the external trapping potential and @xmath11 is the internal electronic wavefunction .",
    "@xmath10 is calculated by solving the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite and @xmath11 may be taken as a correlated orbital obtained from many - body calculation @xcite .",
    "detail calculations are given in our previous work @xcite .",
    "there we have proved that electric dipole interaction of lg beam with bec allows the transfer of the total field oam to the c.m .",
    "motion of bec and thus , changes the vorticity of the matter - wave state .",
    "however , the sam corresponding to polarization is transferred to the internal electronic motion and controls the selection rule .",
    "we consider sodium bec initially prepared in state @xmath12 where @xmath13 is vorticity of c.m .",
    "state and @xmath14 , @xmath15 correspond to hyperfine spin of ground - state na atoms .",
    "figure 1 ( a ) shows a stimulated raman scheme using two sets of counter propagating lg and g pulses . an atom of mass @xmath16 , initially at rest , absorbs an lg photon and stimulatedly emits a g photon , acquiring @xmath17 of linear momentum ( lm ) ( @xmath18 with @xmath19 the photon wavelength ) in the direction of propagation the lg photon . here",
    "we reason out how the two - photon rabi frequency will depend on the handedness of the oam of the lg beam .",
    "two - photon detuning @xmath20 is much larger than the spontaneous emission linewidth of the excited state .",
    "after adiabatically eliminating the intermediate excited state , the effective hamiltonian of the system of two - coupled vortices can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are spin states of un - scattered and raman - scattered atoms , respectively .",
    "the vorticity of the scattered atoms is @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is frequency corresponding to the total energy ( c.m . + internal ) of initial ( final ) state .",
    "@xmath29 is the two - photon rabi frequency for lg@xmath30/g pulse and @xmath31 is the detuning between the two beams .",
    "the states @xmath32 receive the momentum transfer @xmath33 due to two - photon stimulated light scattering . as a result ,",
    "the atoms in @xmath34 gain kinetic energy @xmath35 where @xmath16 is mass of an atom .",
    "the important point here is that the two - photon rabi frequency @xmath36 for lg@xmath37/g pulse is different from @xmath38 for lg@xmath39/g pulse .",
    "the radial portions of c.m .",
    "wavefunctions of bec ( @xmath40 ) corresponding to vorticities @xmath41 and @xmath42 are different ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the rabi frequencies @xmath43 and @xmath44 corresponding to the two transitions different .",
    "thus , in principle , a bec vortex state is expected to show cd - like behavior in interaction with lg beams having oam of opposite handedness . however ,",
    "if initially the bec was in a non - vortex state ( @xmath45 ) then after interaction with lg@xmath46/g and lg@xmath47/g pulses for an appropriate pulse duration the final states of bec will have vorticities @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . the radial portions of c.m",
    ". wavefunctions of these two states are identical .",
    "this makes the c.m .",
    "matrix elements and rabi frequencies corresponding to these transitions identical .",
    "hence , non - vortex state in bec does not show cd - like behavior in interaction with lg beam .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath50 given by eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) describes coherent dynamics of spin - vortex coupled states .",
    "let the solutions of this hamiltonian be @xmath51 under phase matching condition @xmath52 and assuming @xmath53 we have @xmath54 given by @xmath55 , the vortex state @xmath56 will be coherently transferred into the vortex state @xmath57 . for @xmath58 there will be equal superposition of the two vortex states .",
    "thus our scheme opens up new prospect for optical manipulation of matter - wave vortices with an effect that is analogous to cd .",
    "it is important to note that the time evolution of the two states @xmath59 and @xmath60 are different only due to cd - like effect that arises when @xmath61 _ i.e. _ , if the bec is initially in a vortex state . on the other hand",
    ", the temporal evolution of the two states will be the same for @xmath62 due to the absence of cd - like effect .",
    "hence , this effect will play an important role in quantum evolution of spin - vortex coupled bec in a spinor condensate .",
    "the state given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) is an entangled state of spin and matter - wave vortices .",
    "+   +    now , we discuss how this cd - like effect can be useful to detect vortex state in bec and determine the handedness of vorticity using two lg beams having oam of opposite handedness .",
    "we consider sodium bec is initially prepared in electronic state @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "our proposed experimental scheme is shown in figure 1 .",
    "lg@xmath64 and g@xmath65 pulses propagate along @xmath66 axis and lg@xmath47 and g@xmath67 pulses propagate along @xmath68 .",
    "we apply lg@xmath64/g@xmath67 and lg@xmath47/g@xmath65 pulses simultaneously .",
    "the two - photon raman transition by lg@xmath64/g@xmath67 pulse is called type-1 transition and the other two - photon raman transition by lg@xmath47/g@xmath65 pulse is called type-2 transition in this paper . the atoms taking part in the raman transitions for a pulse duration of the order @xmath69 will be in final spin state @xmath70 which is high field seeking state .",
    "therefore , they will no longer be trapped .",
    "in addition , these atoms will gain @xmath17 lm from the raman process and propagate ballistically .",
    "after a few millisecond time of flight ( tof ) , these atoms will be spatially separated from the atoms which are still at rest and trapped .",
    "let us call the atom cloud which has gone through type-1 transition as cloud-1 and the other one as cloud-2 .",
    "then one can use focused pump beam spatially localized along @xmath0 and selectively image atom clouds in different lm states and different spatial positions . in accordance with the cd - like effect described in the previous paragraph",
    ", the number of atoms in cloud-1 will be different from that of cloud-2 depending on the handedness of the initial bec vortex state .",
    "we now proceed to numerically evaluate how the number of atoms in cloud-1 will differ from that of cloud-2 depending on the sign of vorticity of the initial bec .",
    "as mentioned in the previous paragraph , we consider sodium bec containing @xmath71 number of atoms initially prepared in electronic state @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the atoms are trapped in an anisotropic trap . the asymmetry parameter @xmath72 with axial frequency @xmath73",
    "the corresponding characteristic length is @xmath74 @xmath75 m . @xmath76-",
    "wave scattering length is @xmath77 nm @xcite . for phase matching , we set the frequency difference between the two counter propagating lg and g beams as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the recoil energy @xcite ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "in addition to lm , the atoms pick up the oam difference between the two photons and this causes change in rotational motion of the atoms .",
    "corresponding rotational kinetic energy difference between final and initial vortex states is small compared to @xmath80 @xcite and gives rise to rotational doppler shift @xcite .",
    "the laser beams are detuned from the _ _ d__@xmath81 line ( @xmath82 nm ) by @xmath83 ghz ( @xmath84 linewidths , enough to prevent any significant spontaneous photon scattering ) .",
    "the frequency of g@xmath85 are further decreased from lg@xmath86 beams by @xmath80 ( may be using acousto - optic modulators ) .",
    "the intensity of the laser beams are set to be @xmath87 w@xmath88 .",
    "the waists of the lg beams are set to be @xmath89 m .",
    "the radius of the g@xmath85 beams is generally a order of magnitude larger than that of the bec and hence , during interaction with the condensate we have considered the g@xmath85 beams as plane waves .",
    "after type-1 ( type-2 ) two - photon transition , the vorticity of final c.m .",
    "state is going to be changed by @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    ".this illustrates cicular dichroism - like effect in bec vortex states undergoing type-1 and type-2 two - photon raman transitions . @xmath90 and @xmath91 are vorticity of initial and final states of the condensate , respectively .",
    "@xmath3 denotes the winding number of the lg beam associated with the transition . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are dipole rabi frequencies ( s@xmath92 ) corresponding to type-1 and type-2 transitions , respectively . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the two - photon rabi frequencies corresponding to type-1 and type-2 transitions are defined as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , shown in table i. our calculation shows that if @xmath93 then @xmath94 and if @xmath95 then @xmath96 .    andersen _ et .",
    "@xcite used similar two - photon raman transition technique to generate and image bec vortex .",
    "they worked with bec of @xmath97 na atoms and achieved maximum efficiency of the two - photon transition as high as @xmath98 for a @xmath99 @xmath100s lg / g pulse . from their experimental observation we can estimate roughly how the number of atoms in cloud-1 will vary from the number of atoms in cloud-2 .",
    "let us start with @xmath71 number of atoms with initial vorticity @xmath101 and we consider that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are experimentally calibrated so that they are equal for a non - vortex initial state .",
    "we assume that the experimental parameters are set such that @xmath102 of atoms take part in type-2 transition .",
    "according to table i , if @xmath103 , then almost @xmath104 of atoms will take part in type-1 transition and that means cloud-1 will have almost @xmath105 number of atoms more than cloud-2 .",

    "this difference of @xmath109 ( for @xmath110 ) number of atoms is easily detectable by absorption imaging of cloud-1 and cloud-2 @xcite and thereby one can determine the handedness of rotation of the initial bec .",
    "it will be same as the rest of portion of the bec which has not taken part in the raman processes . if the number of atoms in cloud-1 and cloud-2 are almost same then the bec had no vortex state .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that cd - like effects can arise in interaction of a matter - wave vortex with lg beams of opposite oam .",
    "this effect will have wide applications including detection of handedness of the matter - wave vortex as theoretically demonstrated in this paper .",
    "while creating a vortex state from non - rotating bec using two - photon raman transitions by applying square pulses of a particular duration , the transfer efficiency is limited by the spatial mismatch between the rotating state and the initial bec @xcite . in this work",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to take advantage of this limitation that lies at the heart of the predicted cd - like effect . as an application of this effect",
    "we have proposed a method to detect bec vortex states and its handedness using a portion of the condensate .",
    "the main advantages of this method are as follows .",
    "firstly , only single imaging of cloud-1 and cloud-2 is needed .",
    "secondly , we do not need to know the exact number of atoms present in the clouds .",
    "all we need to know is which of the clouds contains more number of atoms .",
    "thirdly , the rest of the condensate which does not take part in the two - photon transitions will remain trapped in its initial state . while this method is suitable for steadily rotating condensate containing single vortex , the situation is different for multiply quantized vortices in a bec .",
