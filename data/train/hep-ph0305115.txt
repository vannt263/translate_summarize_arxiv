    "the mass of @xmath1 is somewhat too large due to the hedgehog shape of the soliton .",
    "therefore , both approaches cooperatively would be in agreement with the experimental value for @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , the deformed soliton corresponding to the strange baryon has less symmetry than the hedgehog soliton . because of the estimation @xcite relied on the hedgehog shape @xcite , the relation between the two approaches is obscure at present .",
    "the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian up to order 1 in the large @xmath0 limit is an even function of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the mean field energy at @xmath54 is degenerate with that at @xmath209 .",
    "a more accurate calculation of the fluctuation off the mean field should treat the tunnel effect .",
    "it is in progress to perform the description of the decuplet baryon and to incorporate the local variation of the kaon wave function .",
    "we would like to thank m.  kawabata and h.  kondo for many fruitful discussions of this problem .",
    "the cutoff function of the vacuum energy for the energy level @xmath99 is given by @xmath210 with the cutoff parameter @xmath2 , where , using the schwinger proper time regularization , @xmath211 may be written as @xmath212    the cutoff function for first order matrix element is given by @xmath213 with @xmath214 the indices @xmath149 and @xmath150 denote the origin of the function from the real and imaginary parts of the action @xmath132 in the imaginary time prescription .",
    "similarly , for the second order matrix elements one obtain @xmath215 where @xmath216 are given by @xmath217    99 g.  t  hooft , nucl .  phys .",
