    "the problem of discriminating among a given set of quantum states is an important part of many quantum communication protocols @xcite .",
    "the parameters of quantum communication channels and their security thresholds with respect to certain eavesdropping attacks are related to the maximally achievable quality of such discrimination , expressed by the accessible information associated with the signal states @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , except for rather simple cases , it is not possible to find explicitly the generalized measurements that maximize the accessed information .",
    "the optimality of a given detection scheme is often conjectured and numerical tools are employed to confirm or reject such a hypothesis .    in this contribution",
    "we consider quantum communication between alice and bob , where alice is using states comprising a quantum pyramid to encode her message .",
    "such a pyramid can be defined by requesting that all pairwise transition amplitudes between the edge states be the same @xcite .",
    "bob performs a measurement on the received quantum systems .",
    "based on the outcomes he tries to identify the received states and decode the message sent to him . naturally , bob seeks the best possible decoding strategy , i.e. he wants to optimize the measurement on his side so that the accessed information associated with the signal state is maximal  in other words : he wishes to extract the accessible information .",
    "our choice of quantum pyramids for alice s signal states is motivated by the fact that discrimination among pyramidal states is regularly encountered in quantum cryptography and other quantum information problems , such as grover s search algorithm @xcite , and hence is of considerable practical interest . at the same time , the high inherent symmetry of quantum pyramids helps to keep the calculations relatively simple and permits to arrive at transparent results .",
    "historically , for some time it was thought that the optimal measurement strategy for pyramidal states is the well - known square - root measurement @xcite and even some security proofs for quantum cryptography were based on this reasonable conjecture @xcite .",
    "recently , however , the optimality of the square - root measurement has been invalidated for a range of parameters of acute pyramids @xcite , and also for obtuse pyramids with three edges and very small volume @xcite . in this contribution ,",
    "obtuse pyramids of any dimension are investigated , so that the optimal measurement strategies for pyramids of any shape and dimension is established .",
    "in particular , by exploiting the pyramidal symmetry , and using numerical methods @xcite for confirmation , a family of measurements is found that outperform the square - root measurement in terms of accessible information about the edges of obtuse pyramid with few edges and small volume .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by introducing quantum pyramids in sec .",
    "[ sec : pyramids ] , and then discuss measurement schemes in general terms in sec .",
    "[ sec : info ] .",
    "section  [ sec : srm ] deals with the square - root measurement , which we use as a benchmark .",
    "unambiguous discrimination is addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ud ] , and the maximization of the accessed information is the theme of sec .  [",
    "sec : ims ] , where we recall the known results about acute pyramids and supplement them with new insights about obtuse pyramids .",
    "finally , we present a unified view that regards all occurring measurement schemes as particular cases of a general scheme and summarize our findings in a table .",
    "a quantum pyramid can be defined as a set of @xmath0 edge states denoted by normalized kets @xmath1 , @xmath2 , such that all pairwise transition amplitudes among these states are equal and real , @xmath3 where @xmath4 a simple geometrical picture is obtained by decomposing edge states in a fixed orthonormal basis so that they can be represented by vectors in real @xmath0-dimensional space ;    an example of a quantum pyramid with three edges @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pyramids ] .",
    "the `` height ket '' @xmath8 is the pyramidal axis of symmetry , and the kets @xmath9 span the @xmath10-dimensional base of the pyramid .",
    "geometrically speaking , the base is itself a @xmath10-dimensional pyramid with edges of length @xmath11 and an angle of @xmath12 between the edges .",
    "the volume enclosed by a pyramid with @xmath0 edges , regarded as an object in real @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space , is given by @xmath13 the single factor @xmath14 refers to the height of the pyramid , and the @xmath15 factors @xmath16 refer to the base .",
    "pyramids may be classified according to the angle between the edge states .",
    "we call a pyramid _ acute _ if @xmath17 , _ orthogonal _ if @xmath18 , and _ obtuse _ if @xmath19 . the orthogonal pyramid ( @xmath20 ) has largest volume , and pyramids with @xmath21 or @xmath22 have very small volume .",
    "pyramids with @xmath23 , are narrow with nearly collinear edges ; for @xmath24 we have the degenerate case of an `` all height '' pyramid with no base .",
    "the opposite case is the extreme obtuse pyramid with @xmath25 , the `` all base '' pyramid with no height ; we call such a degenerate pyramid _ flat_. in fig .",
    "[ fig : pyramids ] , the plane pyramid with the three edges proportional to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , is an example of a flat pyramid .    given a pyramid with edges @xmath1 , the corresponding orthogonal pyramid with edges @xmath28 can be constructed in accordance with @xmath29 which assumes the same orientation with respect to the shared axis of symmetry , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pyramids ] once more .",
    "an orthogonal pyramid may be _ lifted _ by adding a component along the height ket @xmath30 , @xmath31 these kets have a genuine @xmath32 dependence that we leave implicit , but the dependence on @xmath33 is only apparent inasmuch as @xmath34 is a unit ket . after normalizing them , the lifted edges @xmath35 make up pyramids whose parameters are such that @xmath36 , so that we get acute pyramids for @xmath37 , obtuse pyramids for @xmath38 , and the flat pyramid for @xmath39 .    for future reference",
    ", we note that @xmath40  for which @xmath41  is particular , inasmuch as the lifted pyramid for this @xmath32 value is dual to the original pyramid , @xmath42 where we need to exclude the degenerate no - volume pyramids with @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "another , more important , observation is the equality @xmath45 which is central to what follows because it permits a decomposition of the identity operator as a sum of nonnegative operators .",
    "we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 which coincide for @xmath48 .",
    "the generic scenario of quantum communication is as follows .",
    "alice sends bob quantum systems prepared in states described by the normalized statistical operators @xmath49 , with prior probabilities @xmath50 of unit sum .",
    "bob examines the received systems one by one with the aid of a generalized measurement with outcomes @xmath51 , @xmath52 ; typically @xmath53 .",
    "the outcomes are nonnegative probability operators that decompose the identity @xcite,@xmath54 so that the joint probabilities @xmath55 of state @xmath56 being sent _ and _ outcome @xmath51 being detected have unit sum , @xmath57 as they should .",
    "the outcomes @xmath51 constitute a robability perator easurement ( pom ) in the physics jargon , whereas the acronyom povm , short for ositive perator - alued easure , is preferred in the more mathematically oriented literature .",
    "we side with the physicists .    the information accessed by the pom in use is quantified by the mutual information between alice and bob which  in units of bits  is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the corresponding marginal probabilities . if bob chooses his pom such that the value of @xmath60 is maximized , he implements the _ information maximizing scheme _ ( ims ) and thus extracts the _",
    "accessible _ information .",
    "quite a few properties of imss are known , but there are also many open questions ; a recent review of the matter is ref .",
    "the calculation of the accessible information involves a multidimensional nonlinear optimization of the mutual information with respect to the pom outcomes @xmath51 .",
    "this is a difficult problem and closed - form solutions are known only for situations in which there is much symmetry among the signal states @xcite ; we are adding one item to this list here .",
    "when such solutions are not at hand , one must often rely on a numerical search , possibly by the iteration method of ref .",
    "@xcite for which an open - source code is available  @xcite .",
    "the numerical methods are also useful for the verification or rejection of conjectured solutions .",
    "bob could have other objectives than extracting the accessible information .",
    "for instance , if he wishes to maximize his odds of winning bets on the state sent by alice , he implements the _ measurement for error minimization _ ( mem ) , which has as many outcomes as there are states ( @xmath61 ) and maximizes @xmath62 , the probability of guessing the signal state right . as a necessary condition on the respective poms we have @xcite @xmath63 with @xmath64        p_{k\\cdot}\\rho_k&\\mbox{mem , }      \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] but there is an unfortunate lack of equally powerful sufficient conditions .",
    "yet another scheme is the _ measurement for unambiguous discrimination _",
    "( mud ) , which is such that outcomes @xmath51 with @xmath65 imply that the @xmath66th state was sent , that is : @xmath67 for @xmath65 , whereas the outcomes @xmath68 are inconclusive @xcite .",
    "unambiguous discrimination is not possible for arbitrary signal states @xmath56 and , as a rule , the poms needed for the ims , the mem , and the mud are not the same .      specifically , we are here interested in symmetric communication with pyramid states , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath2 . owing to the high symmetry of this situation ,",
    "the poms for ims , mem , and mud can be stated quite explicitly , both for acute and obtuse pyramids .",
    "the symmetry at hand is , of course , the cyclic nature of the pyramid states : there is a unitary operator @xmath71 with period @xmath0 that cyclically permutes the pyramid states , @xmath72 explicit expressions for @xmath71 are @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are understood .",
    "the ensemble of equal - weight pyramid states is , therefore , an example of the `` group covariant case '' of section 11.4.4 in ref .",
    "there is a family of poms that are directly constructed from the signal states @xmath56 , their weights @xmath50 , and their weighted sum , @xmath76 which is the statistical operator for the state in which bob receives the quantum systems . for any operator @xmath77",
    "such that @xmath78 , the @xmath0 outcomes @xmath79 make up a pom with @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath77 is chosen nonnegative , that is : @xmath81 , we have the so - called _ square root measurement _ ( srm ) , also known as the `` pretty good measurement '' because it often accesses a good fraction of the accessible information .",
    "all other permissible choices for @xmath77 are of the form @xmath82 with unitary @xmath71 and amount to an over - all unitary transformation of the srm @xcite .",
    "in the situation of present interest , the symmetric communication with pyramid states , the srm is the von neumann measurement composed of the projectors onto the edges of the orthogonal pyramid @xcite , and the srm coincides with the mem , @xmath83 the resulting odds for guessing the signal state right are @xmath84 which equals @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 for the no - base pyramid ( @xmath44 ) , the orthogonal pyramid ( @xmath20 ) , and the flat pyramid ( @xmath43 ) , respectively .    for some time",
    ", it was conjectured that the srm is also identical with the ims but , as we shall see below , this is only the case for pyramids with sufficiently large volume . in view of this historical conjecture ,",
    "we use the information accessed by the srm , @xmath88 as a benchmark value . for @xmath20",
