    "how classical behavior arises in a quantum mechanical system is one of the essential questions in quantum theory , and has long attracted intense interest .",
    "the quantum to classical transition ( qct ) , which has been well understood to be mainly induced by decoherence caused by the coupling with the environment,@xcite attains some progresses in recent years .",
    "it is proposed that the qct is controlled by relevant parameters including the effective planck constant @xmath3 ( i.e. , the relative size of the planck constant ) , a measure of the coupling with the environment @xmath1 , and the lyapunov exponent @xmath4 , for chaotic systems.@xcite by computing measures which directly reflect the distance  between quantum and classical evolutions , it is shown that the distance is controlled by a composite parameter of the form @xmath5 .",
    "many efforts on investigating the coefficients @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 have been made @xcite in different systems such as the kicked harmonic oscillator and the duffing oscillator .",
    "however , in the previous systems , @xmath9 is generally a constant .",
    "therefore , the direct illustration of the effect of the lyapunov exponent @xmath4 on the computed distance is still open .    in this article",
    "we try to explore the parameter scaling in qct by using the system of the superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) .",
    "rf - squid system has been demonstrated as a well controllable decoherent quantum system .",
    "macroscopic quantum phenomena such as resonant tunneling@xcite and level quantization@xcite and quantum superpositionfriedman have been reported . on the other hand",
    ", the strong coupling between the squid and the environment can introduce chaos . as early as 1983",
    ", the chaotic behavior of the squid treated as a semi - classical model had been found.@xcite recently , a research shows that a three - junction squid can be used to study the dynamics of quantum chaos.@xcite such works motivate us to study the chaotic behavior of squid under decoherence induced by environment , which enables us to directly demonstrate the effect of the lyapunov exponent on qct .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we numerically investigate the chaotic dynamics of squid with coupling to an external environment , and it is shown that the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath0 , which quantifies the chaotic degree of squid , is non - monotonic as a function of @xmath1 , a measure of the coupling .",
    "thus we can say in some regimes of @xmath1 , the chaos of squid is suppressed by the decoherence induced by environmentyamazaki . in sec.iii",
    "we use the uncertainty of dynamics as the distance between quantum and classical evolutions , and show that the uncertainty behaves rightly , even in the chaos suppressed region , as a monotonic function of @xmath2 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first direct demonstration of the scaling relation since it was proposedpattanayak .",
    "the rf - squid system considered here consists of a large superconducting loop interrupted by a single josephson junction with a critical current @xmath10 . under the driving of a external flux @xmath11 with the form of @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively denote the driving amplitude and driving frequency ) ,",
    "the hamiltonian for the squid system can be given as @xmath15where @xmath16 is the junction capacitance , @xmath17 is the rf - squid inductance and @xmath18 denotes the superconducting flux quantum . the magnetic flux threading the rf - squid @xmath19 and the total charge on the capacitor @xmath20 are the conjugate variables of the system with the imposed commutation relation @xmath21=i\\hbar $ ] .",
    "we can rewrite this hamiltonian into a dimensionless one@xcite as @xmath22 in which @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 satisfy the commutation relation @xmath27=i$ ] .    since no chaos can be seen in the dynamics of isolated quantum systems , habib to study the chaotic behaviors of the squid system , we couple the system to a dissipated environment in the markovian limit .",
    "we adopt the quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) @xcite approach which is widely used in studying open quantum systems @xcite to describe the evolution of this coupled system .",
    "the qsd equation for the evolution of the state vector @xmath28 reads @xmath29where @xmath30 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath31 are the lindblad operators representing the coupling with the environment .",
    "@xmath32 are independent complex differential gaussian random variables satisfying @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 denotes the ensemble mean ) . for the squid system considered here , we have @xmath30 and @xmath36 for equation ( [ qsd ] ) as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is shown in equation ( [ reduced squid hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath40 brun , kapulkin is a damping term added to recover the correct equation of motion in the classical limit , and @xmath1 is the strength of the coupling with the environment mentioned in the beginning .     from top to bottom . from middle panel",
    "we can see that points are largely confined in three regions , which indicates a non - monotonic transition of chaos.,width=326 ]    using the powerful qsd library,@xcite we numerically solve the equation ( [ qsd ] ) and investigate the change in the dynamics of the squid system when increasing the strength of dissipation .",
    "a typical set of squid parameters is selected here , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which insures the action of this system is small enough compared with fixed @xmath46.habib then we examine 28 different values of @xmath1 from slightly dissipated ( @xmath47 ) to heavily dissipated regime ( @xmath48 ) in our calculation , during which we have the same initial state @xmath49the coherent state  and same realization of generating the random numbers .",
    "the quantum poincar sections , which each comprises of @xmath50 points taken at a fixed phase of the external driving once a driving period , are shown for three representative values of @xmath1 in fig.1(a)-1(c ) .",
    "it can be clearly seen in fig.1(a ) that points forms a uniformly stretched poincar profile in the phase space which indicates chaosfor @xmath51 . however , for @xmath52 most of points are confined in three relatively small regions as shown in fig.1(b ) , which indicates the suppression of chaos .",
    "then the poincar profile similar to the one in fig.1(a ) is recovered in fig.1(c ) when @xmath1 is increased to @xmath53 .",
    "some non - monotonic analogous phenomena have been studied in classical chaotic systems , yamazaki , matsumoto and a qualitative explanation has been proposed there . if the chaotic attractors are narrowly and non - uniformly distributed in phase space , the fluctuation induced by dissipation may cause the neighboring trajectory jump over it , which results in the suppression of chaos . while further increasing dissipation intensity , the structure of the chaotic attractor may be modified and thus spread wider than before . therefore the system becomes chaotic again .",
    "since @xmath54 form classical - like trajectories in our calculation , we expect that the explanation is also valid for the suppression of chaos in quantum region .",
    "versus @xmath1.the distinctive dip rightly attests the occurrence of suppression of chaos.,width=326 ]    to describe this transition of chaos quantitatively , we calculate the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath55 for a time series  the expectation value of the magnetic flux @xmath56at each value of @xmath57 .",
    "the calculation is based on the method and programs @xcite which are specifically designed for the analysis of nonlinear time series . with carefully chosen parameters as the delay time @xmath58 , the embedding dimension @xmath59 and the scaling length @xmath60 for the calculation to best meet the requirements in ref.18 , the sufficient convergency of the lyapunov exponent is guaranteed .",
    "the result is shown in fig.2 , in which the graph of @xmath0 versus @xmath1 has a distinctive dip in a approximate region of @xmath61 indicating the suppression of chaos .",
    "we also repeat the whole calculation above in some different realization of random numbers with the squid parameters and the initial state fixed , and find the curves are quite analogous to the one in fig.2 .     as a function of ( a ) @xmath1 and ( b ) a composite parameter @xmath62 .",
    "the monotonic increase of @xmath63 as a function of @xmath62 in ( b ) demonstrated the scaling law.,width=336 ]",
    "with the non - monotonic relationship between maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath64 and the strength of the coupling with the environment @xmath1 , we can directly investigate the effect of @xmath0 on qct . to measure the distance between quantum and classical evolution",
    ", we use the well known quantity  the uncertainty of dynamics @xmath65 , which is simple for calculation and adequate to describe the qct . according to the commutation relation @xmath66=i$ ] ,",
    "it follows that @xmath67 . by solving equation ( [ qsd ] ) with same calculating parameters as in sec.ii",
    ", we get a time series of the uncertainty @xmath68 at each value of @xmath1 . after averaging each series of @xmath68 over a reasonably long time ( @xmath69 100 periods of the external driving )",
    ", we obtained the curve of the averaged uncertainty @xmath63 versus @xmath1 and showed in fig.3(a ) , where @xmath1 has the same sequence of values as in fig.2 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that in fig.3(a ) a obvious dip emerges in the very regime where chaos is suppressed by the dissipation , which implies qct directly depends on the degree of chaos .",
    "motivated by this , we combine @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the form of @xmath70 which is inferred in ref.2 and look into the relationship between @xmath71 and such composite single parameter . shown fig.3(b ) is an example of @xmath71 vs. @xmath2 .",
    "one can find that the dip is rubbed out and @xmath71 approximately shows a monotonic increasing in @xmath2 with two distinct regimes of small and large increasing rates.@xcite therefore we demonstrate the scaling between @xmath72 and @xmath1 holds over a considerable range in @xmath71 .",
    "it is noticed that the points which lie in the dip in fig.3(a ) spread slightly around the curve in fig.3(b ) .",
    "we conjecture this spread could be mainly attributed to the calculating error @xcite of @xmath0 which is induced by the inevitable quantum noise added into the trajectory of @xmath54 , especially when chaos is suppressed and the value of @xmath0 is comparatively small .     as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath73.the parameters for the system with largest effective",
    "planck constant @xmath74 has been shown in text .",
    "other @xmath75 and corresponding sets of parameters are listed in table.i.,width=345 ]    .@xmath75 and corresponding parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      versus a composite parameter @xmath62 for different effective plank constant .",
    "it is shown that the scaling law holds for systems with different @xmath3 .",
    "inset : the curve with @xmath76 is shown separately .",
    ", width=374 ]    now we examine this scaling law for the squid system with a smaller effective planck constant @xmath75 . to obtain a smaller @xmath75 ,",
    "it is not straightforward for the squid system to directly manipulate the value of @xmath77 .@xciteinstead , we enlarge the action of the squid system simply by changing parameters in the hamiltonian ; the larger the action the smaller @xmath75 , and vice versa.@xcite by deliberately selecting the set of parameters including @xmath10 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 , we can enlarge the action and maintain the chaotic dynamics of the system at the same time .",
    "the values of these parameters are not difficult to modulate for a realistic squid system where @xmath10 could become controllable by replacing the single josephson junction with a small loop ( dc squid ) which contains two identical josephson junctions,@xcite @xmath16 and @xmath17 are both under the upper realistic limit of typical josephson junctions .",
    "we select four sets of parameters for the squid systems each of which has a smaller @xmath3 compared with the foregoing system s . assuming the smallest @xmath3 is equal to 1 and comparing the actions of the systems which are measured with the system size,@xcite we approximately gain the value of other effective planck constants as follow , 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.9 , 2.6 , where 2.6 is the value of the foregoing system s @xmath3 .",
    "then we apply the same calculating procedures to these systems , and the results are shown in fig.4 and fig.5 which also include the data of the foregoing system for comparison .",
    "fig.4 shows the averaged uncertainty @xmath71 as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath3 . for",
    "each @xmath3,a distinct dip exists as expected in the region where chaos is suppressed by the dissipation of environment .",
    "fig.5 shows the same data plotted as a function of @xmath78 , in which , the behavior of @xmath71 for each @xmath3 is considerably the same , which demonstrates the scaling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is still valid for a system with relatively small @xmath3 . for clarity",
    ", we separately show the curve with @xmath79 in the inset of fig.5 .",
    "since a larger action is helpful to undermine the effect of quantum noise , more accurate @xmath0 can be gained for the system with smaller @xmath3 , which , is reflected in the lack of noticeable spread around the curve in the inset .",
    "we also chose some different random numbers generator to repeat the calculation for squid systems with different @xmath3 , and succeed in getting same qualitative conclusions as discussed above .",
    "in summary , we investigated qct in chaotic rf - squids .",
    "the suppression of chaos induced by environment dissipation was observed in quantum regime . it is found that the quantum to classical transition in the presence of a dissipated environment is governed by a composite parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it could be expected the scaling law between @xmath0 and @xmath1 would holds over a wide range of @xmath3 .",
    "however , to generalize this scaling to the one involving @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 and to reveal the coefficients between them are still open questions needed to explore .",
