    "magnetoelasticity ( or magnetostriction ) is the property of certain solids exhibiting a strong coupling between mechanical and magnetic variables . as effect of this coupling , relevant reversible mechanical deformations can be induced by the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "this behavior is clearly of a great applicative interest in connection with sensors and actuators design , as well as for a variety of innovative functional - material devices .",
    "the origin of magnetoelasticity lies in the interplay between material crystallographic patterning ( where different crystals present different easy axis of magnetization ) and magnetic domains . in absence of external magnetic fields , magnetic domains orient in such a way to minimize long - range dipolar effects .",
    "this generically results in some small or even negligible magnetization of the medium . upon applying an external magnetic field",
    "the magnetic domains tend to reorient toward it .",
    "as magnetizations are related to specific stress - free reference strains , this causes indeed the emergence of a macroscopic deformation . as the intensity of the magnetic field",
    "is increased , more and more magnetic domains orientate themselves so that their principal axes of anisotropy are collinear with the magnetic field in each region and finally saturation is reached .",
    "we refer to e.g.  @xcite for a discussion of the physical foundations of magnetoelasticity .",
    "the mathematical modeling of magnetoelasticity is a vibrant area of research , in particular , in connection with intelligent materials such as iron / rare - earth giant magnetostrictive materials @xcite and magnetic shape - memory alloys @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the understanding of the statics of these materials has attracted considerable attention @xcite . building from one side upon the static thin - film - limit analysis for magnetic materials in gioia & james @xcite and from the other side on the dimension reduction for static linear elastic plates in @xcite , we shall be here concerned with the evolutive situation instead . in particular , we are interested in a slow quasistatic evolution of such materials under the combined action of conservative and dissipative forces .",
    "we indeed assume that the change of magnetization implies dissipation while no dissipation is associated with elastic variables .",
    "the evolution is driven by a dirichlet boundary condition and/or by an external magnetic field .",
    "changes of external conditions are considered to be slow enough so that inertial effects can be neglected and the system is always in equilibrium so that its evolution is quasistatic .",
    "the focus of the paper is on deriving a quasistatic evolution theory for magnetoelastic thin films . after considering the above - mentioned dissipative evolution problem for the bulk , three - dimensional material , we address the thin - film evolution by means of a dimension reduction argument . in particular , we assume that the reference configuration of the body is thin in one dimension and we pass to the limit with respect to it .",
    "our specific choice for the scaling entails that in the limit one obtains a kirchhoff - love quasistatic evolution plate model for magnetoelastic materials .",
    "moreover , we are able to deal with thickness - depedent change of the anisotropic magnetic behavior of the sample , both at the static and the evolutive level .",
    "the novelty of the paper is indeed twofold .",
    "from the one hand , we advance the first quasistatic evolution model for magnetoelastic thin films and prove the existence of suitable variational solutions .",
    "in particular , the emergence of the so - called magnetic anisotropic behavior is emphasized .",
    "secondly , by deriving such a model by dimension reduction , we provide a novel evolutive @xmath0-convergence result in the magnetoelastic context .",
    "this consists in combining some slightly refined version of the already available static thin - film - limit theory within the general frame of the evolutive @xmath0-convergence analysis for rate - independent systems from @xcite .",
    "we shall observe that , as already in @xcite , the magnetostatic energy contribution which is usually difficult to evaluate in micromagnetics reduces in our model to calculating the square of the third component of the magnetization .",
    "this makes the model attractive from the point of view of numerics .",
    "apart from the magnetoelastic setting , dimension reduction via @xmath0-convergence in the quasistatic evolutive setting has already attracted some attention .",
    "liero & mielke derive in @xcite an elastoplastic plate theory in presence of linear kinematic hardening .",
    "a different theory is then obtained by an alternative scaling choice by liero & roche @xcite .",
    "the perfectly - plastic case has then be considered by davoli & mora @xcite and davoli @xcite , also in the frame of finite plasticity .",
    "babadjian obtained in @xcite via dimension reduction the existence of a quasistatic evolution for a free crack in an elastic brittle thin film .",
    "dimension reduction in a delamination context is addressed in @xcite whereas an application to shape - memory thin films is described in @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start by describing the bulk model in the static three - dimensional situation in section [ description ] .",
    "then , the corresponding static thin - film micromagnetic and magnetoelastic limits are discussed in section  [ dimension - reduction ] .",
    "eventually , section [ evo ] focuses on quasistatic evolution situations both in the bulk ( subsection  [ analysis ] ) and in the thin - limit case ( subsection [ kl ] , respectively ) .",
    "in particular , subsection [ kl ] contains our main convergence result , i.e. theorem  [ thm ] .",
    "let us start by specifying the modelization in the three - dimensional setting .",
    "the thin - film model will then be derived in section [ evo ] by means of a rigorous dimension reduction procedure .",
    "we assume to have fixed an orthonormal basis @xmath1 of @xmath2 and to be given a thin magnetic body with reference configuration @xmath3 . here , @xmath4 is a bounded lipschitz domain in the @xmath5-plane and @xmath6 represents the small thickness of the specimen , eventually bound to go to @xmath7 .",
    "the magnetization of the body is described by @xmath8 subject to the saturation constraint @xmath9 where the _ saturation magnetization _",
    "@xmath10 is assumed to be constant .",
    "the micromagnetic energy of the film is classically defined as @xcite @xmath11 the _ stray field _",

    "the first term in the integral in ( [ micromagenergy ] ) is the _ exchange energy _ , penalizing indeed spatial changes of the magnetization .",
    "the ( thickness - dependent ) _ magnetic potential _ @xmath20 describes the magnetic anisotropy of the material .",
    "in particular , for all thicknesses @xmath21 and @xmath22 it is an even function vanishing precisely at the set @xmath23 for some @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for uniaxial magnets and @xmath26 or @xmath27 for cubic magnets . the lines through @xmath28 are called _ easy axes _ of the magnet . the space dependence in @xmath29",
    "is intended to model the polycrystalline texture of the medium and we assume @xmath30 to be continuous .",
    "this particularly entails that the anisotropic energy term is lower semicontinuous with respect to the @xmath31 topology .",
    "following the classical theory by nel @xcite , we allow the magnetic anisotropy of the medium to depend on the sample thickness .",
    "it is indeed observed that many material systems develop a very strong magnetic anisotropy in the off - plane direction as @xmath32 , see @xcite , for instance .",
    "this effect is at the basis of the so - called _ perpendicular recording _ technology , see the review @xcite .",
    "the term containing @xmath33 is the so - called _ stray - field energy _ and represents long - range dipolar self - interactions favoring indeed the formation of a solenoidal magnetic field . in particular",
    ", @xmath34 is the _",
    "magnetostatic potential_. eventually , the last term in the right - hand side of is the _ zeeman energy _ , namely the work done by the external magnetic field @xmath35 .",
    "we anticipate that in section [ evo ] the external field will depend on time and drive the quasistatic evolution of the film .",
    "an application of the direct method of the calculus of variations , see e.g.  @xcite , ensures that for every @xmath21 , the micromagnetic energy @xmath36 admits a minimizer in the set @xmath37      the medium will be subject to nonhomogeneous time - dependent dirichlet boundary conditions on some distinguished part @xmath38 of the boundary @xmath39 where @xmath40 is of positive surface measure . in order to prescribe these conditions we assume to be given @xmath41 and",

    "in fact , other forms of @xmath55 can also be covered by our model as long as they enjoy the mentioned properties .",
    "the _ elastic energy _ of the medium is classically described by the quadratic form @xmath57 given the magnetization @xmath13 , the elastic equilibrium problem consists in finding @xmath58 minimizing the elastic energy @xmath59 on the set of admissible displacements @xmath60 this problem has clearly a unique solution which depends linearly on both @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
