    "during recent years , studies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have greatly improved our understanding of the early universe .",
    "observations of the cmb anisotropies , such as those obtained by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment @xcite , have provided us with a deep insight on the composition of structure and energy in our universe , giving rise to the @xmath7cdm model .",
    "the @xmath7cdm model requires that the universe has undergone an epoch of rapid accelerated expansion .",
    "this epoch is named inflation , and is thought to have been driven by a single or several scalar fields@xcite .",
    "in addition , the model of inflation establishes a highly successful theory for the formation of primordial density perturbations , providing the required seeds for the large - scale structures ( lss ) .",
    "these large scales structures are observed in the cmb today @xcite .",
    "inflation can explain why the observed universe should be nearly isotropic on large scales .",
    "however , anomalies found in the cmb during the recent years @xcite suggest that some anisotropy could be present at inflation too .",
    "several theoretical possibilities were put forward to explain such anomalies @xcite .",
    "one of the possibilities is to introduce a vector field that breaks the rotational invariance in the early universe .",
    "the presence of such vector fields lead to quadrupole modulations of the cmb anisotropy , which for vector perturbations was shown by @xcite .",
    "recently , it was also suggested by @xcite that the 5-year wmap data contains a significant signal of a primordial vector field which would break rotational invariance , corresponding to a 9@xmath8 detection in the w - band .",
    "however , several authors have since then claimed that the signal is due to systematic effects , as the rotational axis is aligned with the rotational axis of the satellite .",
    "a likely candidate for the source of the signal is therefore asymmetric instrumental beams @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that there is no signal of breaking of rotational - invariance in the observed lss data , which makes less likely that the signal is of a cosmological origin .",
    "unfortunately , such scenarios seem to be plagued with ghosts @xcite and several other sorts of instabilities @xcite , but various generalizations and alternatives can also be considered @xcite .",
    "several of the anomalies , such as the axis of evil or the hemispherical asymmetry in the power spectrum , raise the question whether there could exist odd - parity modulations in the cmb .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the effects of space - time non - commutativity at inflation can generate modulations . the leading contribution , as generically in any parity - violating model , is a dipole modulation , but up to now it hasnt been explicitly looked for from the observed microwave sky .",
    "there is a general framework for describing the effects on the cmb anisotropy in terms of bipolar harmonic expansion @xcite which we we apply here .",
    "the theoretical background is discussed in section [ sec : background ] , while the numerical implementation is discussed in section [ sec : methods ] . in section [ sec : properties ] , we investigate the model properties and conclude that the effect is similar to a hemispherical dipole asymmetry .",
    "we perform several analyses on simulated data and discuss the joint posterior results . in section [ sec",
    ": analysis ] , we analyze the seven - year wmap sky maps and find weak evidence for a preferred direction located at the previously described hemispherical power asymmetry by @xcite . in [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude our results , and discuss what how more general models might give rise to more significant results .",
    "the parity violating effect on the primordial power spectrum studied in the present paper can be generated by quantum effects during or shortly after inflation .",
    "such effects have yet to be considered due to the popular assumption that the power spectrum should be invariant under spatial inversion . in principle",
    "there are no physical arguments that exclude them as long as the physical observables generated from the theory are consistent , so one should therefore test this class of models against wmap data and assess their viability .",
    "the odd - parity bispectrum was recently explored in a similar spirit by @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that by taking into account non - commutativity of space - time at very short distance scales , the inflationary power spectrum becomes direction - dependent .",
    "this result can be derived in several ways .",
    "the canonical @xmath9-type non - commutation relations are [ com ] = i _ , where @xmath10 is an antisymmetric constant matrix of dimension length squared that in the simplest case is a constant in a given coordinate system .",
    "effectively this results in a non - commutative field theory .",
    "another way to incorporate ( stringy ) uncertainty principle into geometry is to define a deformation of the heisenberg algebra of the quantum fields .",
    "it was shown that with simple assumptions , in both approaches one may predict , a power spectrum of the form$ ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are parameters typically of order one , and the trigonometric functions can be replaced by hyperbolic ones depending on the prescription . however , at the leading order the behavior is qualitatively the same . ]",
    "[ eq : pk ] p _ ( ) = p_0(k)e^ih where @xmath13 is the ( isotropic ) power spectrum when the non - commutativity is turned off .",
    "@xmath14 is the hubble factor and @xmath15 is the time - space component of the non - commutativity matrix , which sets the scale for the strength of the dipole modulation correction , or @xmath16 in the present formalism . for a comparison with other literature see the references cited by @xcite .",
    "the main feature of this model is the parity - violating power spectrum referenced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pk ] ) which implies that the two - point correlations , or the covariance matrix , generates consistent physical observables such as cmb maps without any further modifications .",
    "however , it may turn out that similar criticisms apply also for these early universe models as were mentioned against models which break rotation invariance at early times such as the one by @xcite .",
    "in particular , the present realisations of field theories involving space - time non - commutativity may not be unitary .",
    "as a fully consistent underlying non - commutative theory is still lacking , obviously we can not make a unique and sharp prediction of the fine details of its implications to cosmology .",
    "they depend upon the inflationary model and the form of non - commutativity ( for example , whether @xmath17 is constant in eq.([com ] ) and in which coordinates ) .",
    "these objections notwithstanding , our search of a dipole signature is strongly motivated since it is a generic prediction of these theories , and it seems a quite unique prediction too , since it appears to be otherwise difficult to realize the situation where the primordial spectrum of fluctuations is not symmetric .",
    "it is worth stressing also that order - of - magnitude estimates show that the theoretically plausible energy scales of non - commutativity are already probed by the present cmb experiments and the ensuing bounds will be pushed higher by the planck satellite data .",
    "thus , testing the leading order signature ( dipole ) , gives us clues what to expect in a given non - commutative model for the next - to - leading signatures ( higher multipole modulations and non - gaussianity ) .",
    "this provides an observational handle for the construction of viable and consistent theory .",
    "the prediction for the cmb anisotropy pattern in non - commutative geometry begins with the expansion of the primordial spectrum : @xmath18 where the parameterisation by @xcite is employed .",
    "the sum over @xmath19 could in principle cover the entire spectrum of multipoles and @xmath20 runs from @xmath21 to @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting signal covariance is written as [ eq : scov ] s_m; m = _ l , m _",
    "m i^lm_ where the spectral - index @xmath22 that parameterises the scale - dependence is included in the integrated contribution over all scales , i^lm_ = _ 0^()^n_lm-1 _ ( k ) _ (k ) .",
    "the multipole moments of the sources @xmath23 are computed using a modified version of camb @xcite with the spectral index as an input parameter .",
    "the geometrical factors @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scov ] ) are provided by @xcite .",
    "the non - commutative nature of the fields responsible for the perturbations give rise to non - hermitian signal covariance @xmath25 for the dipole ( @xmath26 ) contribution which is the only term in the expansion that is considered in the present paper .",
    "the naive expectation from both theory and observations is that higher order terms are suppressed .",
    "this make this assumption here but it should be examined more thoroughly .",
    "the anisotropy in ( [ eq : scov ] ) is then added to the isotropic signal , corresponding to the @xmath27 term .",
    "one obtains a direct interpretation of @xmath28 as the primordial scalar amplitude in the canonical expression for the isotropic matter spectrum .",
    "furthermore [ eq : apmz ] _",
    "1 m = _ 1 m r_m where @xmath29 is the amplitude which we are estimating .",
    "the constant of proportionality in all three cases is @xmath30 where @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the non - commutative lengthscale , @xmath33 is the pivot - scale .",
    "the unit vectors appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : apmz ] ) are the spherical vectors parameterising the direction of the anisotropy , [ eq : uvec ] _",
    "= ( ) , _ 0 = _ z. in the case ( [ com ] ) with @xmath9 constant in the comoving frame , we have @xmath34 and @xmath35 , but as argued above this need not be the case for general models .",
    "thus we will check this particular case separately but otherwise keep both the spectral index and the amplitude as free parameters .",
    "so in all the model contains six unknown parameters , the three spectral indices @xmath36 , the non - commutative lengthscale @xmath37 , and a direction @xmath0 contained in the unit vectors of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uvec ] ) .",
    "however , typically the slope of the modulation does not depend upon the azimuthal orientation .",
    "then the number of parameters is reduced to four : the direction @xmath0 , a coupling @xmath1 and the reduced spectral index @xmath2 for the @xmath26 case .",
    "we now discuss the method for mapping out the desired posterior .",
    "the method for obtaining the posterior is similar to the method presented in @xcite , with the exception of a new covariance matrix and a new parameter .",
    "cmb data observations can be modeled as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the observed data , @xmath40 denotes convolution by an instrumental beam , @xmath41 is the cmb sky signal represented in either harmonic or real space and @xmath42 is instrumental noise . it is generally a good approximation to assume both the cmb and noise to be zero mean gaussian distributed variates , with covariance matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . in harmonic space ,",
    "the signal covariance matrix is defined by @xmath45 . in the isotropic case",
    ", this matrix is diagonal .",
    "the connection to cosmological parameters @xmath46 is made through this covariance matrix .",
    "finally , for experiments such as wmap , the noise is often assumed uncorrelated between pixels , @xmath47 , for pixels @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and noise rms equals to @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath46 denote a set of cosmological parameters .",
    "our goal is to compute the full joint posterior @xmath51 , which is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the likelihood and @xmath54 a prior . for a gaussian data model , the likelihood",
    "is expressed as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total covariance matrix .",
    "the problem of extracting the cosmological signal @xmath57 and @xmath46 from the full signal by gibbs sampling was addressed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cmb gibbs sampler is an exact monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method that assumes prior knowledge of the conditional distributions in order to gain knowledge of the full joint distribution . a significant fraction of the cmb data is completely dominated by galactic foreground , and about @xmath58 of the data needs to be removed .",
    "this might sound trivial , but in reality it complicates processes as the spherical harmonics no longer are orthogonal .",
    "the gibbs sampler solves this problem intrinsically , as the galaxy mask becomes a part of the framework @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for introducing the cmb gibbs sampler is the drastically improvement in scaling . with conventional mcmc methods",
    ", one needs to sample the angular power spectrum , @xmath59 , from the distribution @xmath60 , which scales as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the size of the covariance matrix . for a white noise case ,",
    "the gibbs sampler reduces this to @xmath63 . in other words ,",
    "the gibbs sampler enables effective sampling in the high-@xmath64 regime .      in order to sample from the full joint distribution @xmath65 using the gibbs sampler",
    ", we must know the exact conditional distributions @xmath66 .",
    "the gibbs sampler then proceeds by alternating sampling from each of these distributions : @xmath67 the first conditional distribution is expressed as : @xmath68 and is distributed according to an inverse gamma function with @xmath69 degrees of freedom .",
    "the remaining conditional distribution is @xmath70 where @xmath71 . in other words",
    ", @xmath72 is a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath73 and covariance @xmath74 .",
    "numerical methods for sampling from these distributions were discussed by @xcite .",
    "in this section , we review the numerical setup of the analysis . most of the framework is similar to the one employed by @xcite .",
    "however , we introduce a new parameter in addition to the anisotropic amplitude coupling @xmath75 and the directional parameters @xmath9 and @xmath76 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 represents the spectral index of the correlation integral for the @xmath26 case , and determines the tilt of the correlation power spectrum .",
    "we have previously developed a mcmc framework that enables sampling over sparse anisotropic universe models , meaning models predicting a covariance matrix that is sparse .",
    "this mcmc sampler is integrated into a gibbs sampler named commander @xcite .",
    "the gibbs sampler alternates between sampling the cmb signal and the anisotropic model parameters .",
    "the details on how this method was implemented was described by @xcite .",
    "the covariance matrix is for this model given as follows : @xmath77 throughout this paper , we are only concerned with the dipole modulations , or @xmath26",
    ". a plot of the sparse covariance matrix @xmath78 can be seen in [ fig : covmat ] .",
    "the diagonal case @xmath27 represents the power spectrum @xmath79 , where we assume the tilt is equal to the spectral index @xmath80 from the best - fit seven - year wmap spectral index @xcite .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath2 to replace @xmath81 for the @xmath26 case as such : @xmath82    where we have chosen @xmath83 as the tilt scale .",
    "three examples of @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 are presented in figure [ fig : integrals ] .",
    "the integral in equation [ eq : integral ] needs to be pre - computed in numerical software such as camb @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to implement camb into the existing gibbs sampler framework , so we utilize a different scheme .",
    "first , we pre - compute 10 000 integrals for @xmath2 in an interval @xmath87 $ ] and store the data in a binary file .",
    "this interval is large enough to allow for all types of scale - dependence in the anisotropy , and is our prior for @xmath2 .",
    "for all purposes we consider @xmath2 to be continuous .",
    "the precomputed binary file is then loaded into the anisotropic mcmc framework such that @xmath2 can be treated as a free parameter .",
    "when simulating cmb maps for this model , the connection to a hemispherical dipole asymmetry becomes imminent .",
    "this is depicted the top - left frame of figure [ fig : dipolemap ] , where we present a simulated cmb map with @xmath88 and @xmath89 with direction @xmath90 . in order to verify that this really is a signal similar to a dipole modulation , we simulate a map with @xmath91 and divide the @xmath92 map with the @xmath93 map .",
    "the resulting dipole structure can be seen in the remaining tree maps in figure [ fig : dipolemap ] , where we have included simulations with tilt parameter @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "note that from the integral in figure [ fig : integrals ] , @xmath94 corresponds to a large - scale dipole modulation while @xmath95 contains more small - scale modulations .",
    "we verify code by performing both a brute - force and mcmc analysis on a noise - free , unconvolved simulated cmb map with no sky cut . in order to build the joint two - dimensional distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    ", we need an increased amount of samples as compared to the case by @xcite . in addition , adding a new parameter will in general decrease the significance of the results if the parameters are correlated . as @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be expected to be correlated , we choose to normalize the integrals such that the area under each graph for all @xmath2 are the same . the degeneracy is broken , as can be seen in figure [ fig : simulated_results ] . here",
    ", we create a noiseless , unconvolved cmb map with @xmath96 and @xmath97 adopting the best - fit @xmath7cdm model determined from the seven - year wmap data @xcite .",
    "the model input parameters are @xmath89 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the joint and marginal posteriors are presented in figure [ fig : simulated_results ] .",
    "note how the posterior of @xmath2 is distributed similarly to a @xmath100-alike distribution , and that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not degenerate .",
    "the distribution is always symmetric around @xmath91 , due to negative amplitude @xmath1 in a direction @xmath101 corresponds to a positive amplitude in the opposite direction @xmath102 .",
    "this is not a problem when @xmath1 is large when compared to its standard deviation , but for low values of @xmath1 it becomes difficult to separate the negative peak from the positive , as they will merge .",
    "we continue by creating realistic v - band differencing assembly ( da ) simulations with @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 with direction @xmath106 .",
    "the maps are produced using the v - band beam and noise properties .",
    "in addition , we add synchrotron , free - free and thermal dust foreground templates as described by @xcite . the v1 simulation is depicted in figure [ fig : simulated_v1_results ] .",
    "the analysis is performed using the gibbs sampler for @xmath107 where we impose the kq85 mask @xcite , which removes 18% of the sky .",
    "the analysis successfully reproduce the input parameters , as is seen in figure [ fig : simulated_v1_results ] .",
    "however , note that the distributions are wider than in the noiseless , perfect case , and that tail of the marginal posterior @xmath108 merges with the positive values of @xmath109 near zero .",
    "in this paper , we consider the seven - year wmap temperature sky maps @xcite , and analyze the v- , w and q ( 61 , 94 and 41 ghz , respectively ) .",
    "the v- and w - bands are believed to be the cleanest wmap bands in terms of residual foregrounds .",
    "we adopt the template - corrected , foreground reduced maps recommended by the wmap team for cosmological analysis , and impose the kq85 mask @xcite .",
    "point source cuts are imposed in all cases .",
    "we analyze the data frequency - by - frequency , and consider the combinations v1+v2 , q1+q2 and w1 through w4 .",
    "the noise rms patterns and beam profiles are taken into account for each da individually .",
    "the noise is assumed uncorrelated . for details on joint gibbs analysis of multi - frequency data ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "all data used in this analysis are available from lambda .",
    "the angular resolutions of the v- , w- and q bands are @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "the sky maps are pixelized at a healpix resolution of @xmath113 with @xmath114 pixels .",
    "we adopt a harmonic space cutoff of @xmath115 for the two data sets , probing partly into the noise dominated regime .",
    "however , we do not consider multipoles at @xmath116 for the anisotropic part of the signal covariance matrix , in order to minimize the chance of systematic effects such as residual point source contributions , beam uncertainties or noise mis - estimation to affect our results .",
    "we present the marginal posteriors for the dipole model obtained from the seven - year wmap temperature sky maps , as computed with the method described in section [ sec : methods ] .",
    "first , in the top row of figure [ fig : main_wmap7_results ] we show the preferred direction posteriors , @xmath117 for the w- and v band data .",
    "the joint posterior @xmath118 is depicted in the middle row , while the bottom row displays the marginal posteriors,@xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "lcccc w1 - 4 & @xmath121 & kq85 & @xmath122 & @xmath123 + v1 - 2 & @xmath121 & kq85 & @xmath124 & @xmath125 + v1 - 2 & @xmath121 & kq75 & @xmath124 & @xmath125 + q1 - 2 & @xmath121 & kq85 & @xmath126 & @xmath125    the direction of the dipole amplitude is located at about @xmath127 in all the bands .",
    "this corresponds to the direction of the previously discovered hemispherical power asymmetry by @xcite at @xmath128 , and suggests that the signal has a cosmological origin .",
    "the tilt parameter @xmath2 is found consistently around @xmath129 , implying that the dipole effects are mostly concentrated on large scales for @xmath130 .",
    "the coupling strength of the dipole contribution @xmath1 for various bands are listed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "note the value of @xmath1 is close to zero , there are several contaminating sources that contribute to the posterior .",
    "one source is the fact that there are degeneracies between @xmath1 and @xmath2 for low values of @xmath1 , so the marginal posterior have noise - related contributions close to @xmath129 .",
    "in addition , when @xmath1 is close to zero , there is a contribution from the symmetrical posterior from negative @xmath1 that spill over to positive values .",
    "when keeping this in mind , it should altogether be clear that when inspecting the posteriors that the amplitude parameter @xmath1 is nonzero at about a @xmath131 significance in the w- , v- and q bands .",
    "since the canonical form of non - commutativity , given by eq.([com ] ) with @xmath9 a constant in the comoving frame , is of specific interest , we have tested this case separately .",
    "basically this amounts to fixing the spectral index to the theoretical prediction @xmath132 and varying only three parameters . in that case",
    "we that the data is consistent with a vanishing anisotropic contribution and bounds @xmath133 .",
    "this translates into a couple of orders of magnitude looser bounds than obtained by @xcite from the power spectrum alone , since the effect is at small scales which we cut out from the analysis @xmath134 .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a numerical method for investigating traces of non - commutative geometry derived from field - theoretical implementations of microcausality violation in the seven - year wmap data .",
    "the deformation of lorentz symmetry relevant at inflation induces parity - violating modulations of the primordial power spectrum , which give rise to a dipole - modulation effect in the cmb .",
    "the dipole modulation has certain similarities to the previously detected hemispherical power asymmetry , and not surprisingly , we reproduced the direction of the hemispherical power asymmetry at @xmath135 when analyzing the combined seven - year data sets .",
    "in addition , both the direction and amplitude are stable and nonzero at a @xmath136 level in the w- , v- and q bands .",
    "the tilt parameter @xmath2 is firmly located around zero , indicating that the seven - year wmap data prefers the dipole modulations to occur on large scales @xmath130 . while these results are intriguing",
    ", the significance is still too low to be considered a clear detection .",
    "this could be due to the fact our parameterization of the leading order effect may not capture the underlying physics to the full effect .",
    "in addition , one should take into account the higher order multipoles and vary also the cosmological parameters .",
