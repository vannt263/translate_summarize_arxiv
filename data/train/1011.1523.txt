    "the intriguing relation between evolutionary dynamics and statistical mechanics @xcite has attracted the interest of great evolutionary theorists like fisher @xcite or kimura @xcite that have related their results to the second principle of thermodynamics or to the theory of gases .",
    "interestingly , the relation between evolutionary theory and quantum statistical mechanics is emerging from a series of independent works @xcite that show a class of phase transitions occurring in evolution of haploid populations and other evolving complex systems described by a bose - einstein condensation . in haploid populations ,",
    "this transition is the quasi - species phase transition @xcite in which a finite fraction of an asexual population ends up having the same genotype if the selective pressure is over a critical value and the mutation rate is smaller than a critical value .",
    "moreover , in a recent paper @xcite it was shown that a condensation transition in the bose - einstein universality class occurs also in the evolution of diploid sexual populations in presence of epistatic interactions . when this condensation occurs , a finite fraction of pairs of genetic loci in epistatic interactions is fixed .",
    "the deep relation between evolutionary theory and the formalism of quantum mechanics extends also to the dynamical description of biological evolution .",
    "the quantum spin - chain formalism has been shown to solve models of asexual evolution @xcite . moreover ,",
    "two papers have recently highlighted in specific cases ( asexual evolution in mean - field landscapes @xcite and asexual evolution in fluctuating environment @xcite ) the role of path integrals in describing the temporal evolution of populations .    in this paper",
    "we propose a general theoretical framework that reconciles all the cited results and extends both to asexual and sexual populations defined over complex fitness landscapes .",
    "the analogies that are present at mathematical level between biological evolution and quantum mechanics are highlighted .",
    "in particular we explore the different nature of the path integral calculation that solves for the dynamical evolution of complex populations .",
    "the difference that resides between asexual and sexual evolution is that these phylogenies are sums of linear lineages for asexual populations , instead for sexual populations they are sums over trees of ancestors , each individual having two parents , four grandparents and so on . finally we show that quantum statistics ( both fermi - dirac and bose - einstein statistics ) characterize the steady state distribution of sexual and asexual populations in simple cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the equations of evolution of asexual populations and in section iii we present the equations and the structure of their solution for sexual populations . in each of these sections",
    "we first study the off - equilibrium evolution with non - overlapping generations , then we study the evolution with overlapping generations and finally we characterize the steady state distribution of the evolutionary dynamics in simple cases . finally in section iv we give the conclusions .",
    "the genome of an asexual organism is formed by a single copy of each chromosome . if we indicate by @xmath0 a genetic locus , a given genotype is determined by the allelic states @xmath1 at each genetic locus @xmath2 .",
    "the allelic state @xmath3 at each genetic locus @xmath2 can take 4 values corresponding to adenine , thymine , cytosine , guanine , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "the population evolves under the drive of selection that favors allelic configurations corresponding to higher reproduction rate , and mutations that increase the genetic variation in the population .",
    "we assume that the reproductive rate @xmath5 , also called wright fitness , of a genotype @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fisher fitness and @xmath9 is the _ selective pressure_. if @xmath10 every genotype has the same reproductive rate . if @xmath11 the difference in reproductive rate of genotypes having different @xmath8 is strongly enhanced .      in the literature , usually the case of non - overlapping generations",
    "is studied @xcite .",
    "the equations for asexual evolution are written in terms of the probability @xmath12 that at generation @xmath13 an individual of the population has genotype @xmath6 .",
    "the equation for the evolutionary dynamics in non - overlapping generations is given by @xcite @xmath14 where the normalization constant @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 the matrix @xmath17 in eq .",
    "@xmath18 represents the probability of mutations between genotype @xmath19 to genotypes @xmath6 in the next generation .",

    "let us decompose the probability distribution @xmath31 on the basis of the eigenfunctions @xmath29 according to the following expression , i.e. @xmath32 using @xmath18 we obtain the dynamical equation for the coefficients @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 therefore , asymptotically in time the population is converging to the distribution corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue @xmath35 .",
    "the partition function @xmath36 is then given by @xmath37      we now write the equation of biological evolution in continuous time .",
    "therefore we assume that at each time there can be a birth or a death process .",
    "we assume that the birth process depends on the reproductive rate @xmath38 $ ] and that the death process is a random drift .",

    "the partition function @xmath15 in eq .",

    "finally , using @xmath52 we can derive the equation obeyed by the partition function @xmath58 , @xmath59 this equation is related to the fisher theorem of natural selection @xcite and describes the fact that evolution is an off - equilibrium process .",
    "in fact , since @xmath60 is the average reproductive rate of the population , eq .",
    "@xmath61 expresses the fact that this average reproductive rate always increases asymptotically in time as long as the environment does not change , i.e. the fisher fitness function @xmath8 and the selective pressure remain constant in time .",
    "@xmath42 shows surprising similarities with quantum mechanics that have been highlighted in a recent paper @xcite presenting a unified framework between this evolutionary equation and stochastic quantization .",
    "the kingman model @xcite is one of the most interesting stylized models of asexual evolution where the quasi - species transition is observed . in the framework of this model",
    "the quasi - species transition can be exactly mapped to the bose - einstein condensation in a bose gas .",
    "one interesting aspect of the kingman model is that the evolutionary dynamics reaches an equilibrium due to the constant drive of random mutations . in the kingman model each individual",
    "is assigned a single real parameter @xmath62 determining its reproductive rate @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 moreover , in this model , when a mutation occurs a new offspring is generated with random fitness @xmath65 drawn from a given distribution @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , instead of writing eq .",
    "@xmath42 for the probability @xmath67 that an individual of the population has genotype @xmath6 , we can write the equation for the probability @xmath68 that a random individual in the population is associated with a given fisher fitness @xmath65 at time @xmath13 and had the last mutation at time @xmath69 .",

    "@xmath84 can be limited from above . as a result , at high enough selection pressure and low enough mutation rate",
    "the system might undergo a condensation phase transition in the bose - einstein universality class . below this phase transition",
    "a finite fraction of the individuals in the population shares the same genotype corresponding to the maximal fitness .",
    "this is one of the principal examples that show the so called quasi - species transition : for low mutation rate and high selective pressure a finite fraction of the population is found to have the same genotype .",
    "interestingly a similar phase transition occurs also in evolving ecologies @xcite where the invasive species might strongly reduce the biodiversity , and in evolving models of complex networks @xcite where there might be the emergence of super - hubs like google in the world - wide - web .",
    "the fermi - dirac distribution can be obtained in presence of negative selection by a similar mechanism that generates the bose - einstein distribution in the kingman model .",

    "in sexual populations , the somatic cells of diploid organisms have two homologous copies of each chromosome .",
