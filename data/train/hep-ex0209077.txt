    "@xmath3 and @xmath6 boson production cross - section measurements in @xmath4 collisions are a test of the consistency of standard - model couplings , constrain proton parton distribution functions , and provide information on higher - order qcd corrections .",
    "they also test the mettle of an experiment , as the measurements require good understanding of detection efficiencies , backgrounds , and luminosity .",
    "if experimental uncertainties are small , and the cross sections can be well - estimated from theory , the boson production rates can be interpreted as a measure of luminosity , and can also be used to normalize measurements of other production cross sections . finally , @xmath3 and @xmath6 bosons provide a path to the physics of run ii at the tevatron , where many signatures of top - quark and higgs - boson production can include these bosons .    at the tevatron ,",
    "protons and antiprotons collide at a center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev .",
    "a @xmath3 boson appears in the detector as a high - momentum lepton and large missing energy due to the undetected neutrino .",
    "as the @xmath7 component of @xmath8 is unmeasured , all quantites are measured in the transverse plane .",
    "a @xmath6 boson appears as two high - momentum opposite - signed leptons with an invariant mass around 90 gev .",
    "the cross section can be expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of observed boson events , @xmath11 is the estimated number of background events , @xmath12 is the kinematic and geometric acceptance , @xmath13 is the total efficiency , and @xmath14 is the integrated luminosity .",
    "the lepton plus missing transverse - energy sample can be accounted for by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , qcd jets ( fake leptons ) , and ( for muons ) cosmic rays , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "cdf measures the @xmath3 cross section in the electron and muon decay channels , and d0 does so in the electron channel .",
    "( cdf also looks at monojet events with large missing energy , and sees an enhancement in the number of jets with one and three charged tracks , evidence for @xmath17 decays . )",
    "the inputs and results for the cross - section measurements are given in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the measurements are systematics - limited , with the overall uncertainty typically dominated by the uncertainty in the integrated - luminosity measurement .",
    "the quoted uncertainty on the luminosity should be considered an upper limit .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "understanding qcd effects in @xmath3 production helps reduce uncertainties in @xmath18 and other electroweak measurements . without qcd , when the @xmath3 has no transverse momentum ( @xmath19 ) , the differential cross section for the charged lepton in the @xmath3 decay is @xmath20 , as predicted by the @xmath21 interaction .",
    "but in nlo qcd , the differential cross section in the collins - soper rest frame is given as @xmath22 where the @xmath23 depend on @xmath19 and the boson rapidity ; the latter is typically integrated out .",
    "( the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 terms can be safely neglected . )",
    "thus , angular distributions when @xmath28 probe the values of the @xmath23 , which can then be compared to predictions from nlo qcd .",
    "the d0 experiment has made a measurement of @xmath29 in run i data@xcite , and cdf now has measurements of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 from run i data .",
    "the @xmath32 distribution of the decay leptons is obtained by integrating equation  [ eq ] over @xmath33 : @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "there is no sensitivity to @xmath37 due to the unknown @xmath38 , but there is sensitivity to @xmath39 through the shape of the @xmath3 transverse - mass spectrum , which changes with @xmath19 .",
    "the run i cdf @xmath3 sample is separated into four bins of @xmath19 , and in each one a maximum - likelihood fit to the @xmath40 spectrum is performed to extract @xmath39 , accounting for background contamination and detector acceptance .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] , along with the earlier d0 results and the prediction from qcd .",
    "there is good agreement among all three ; the decrease in @xmath39 with @xmath19 indicates increasing longitudinal polarization , as is expected .",
    "the cdf measurement is statistics - limited , with systematic uncertainties dominated by uncertainty in @xmath18 , @xmath41 , and the model of the @xmath3 recoil .",
    "similarly , one can integrate over @xmath32 in equation  [ eq ] to obtain an expression that depends on @xmath33 .",
    "measuring the @xmath33 distribution of the lepton from @xmath3 decay gives information on the @xmath30 and @xmath31 coefficients .",
    "again , events from the run i cdf @xmath3 sample are separated into four bins of @xmath19 ; the events are required to have at least one hadronic jet to ensure that @xmath42 .",
    "a maximum - likelihood fit to the @xmath33 distribution is performed to extract @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] , along with the prediction from qcd .",
    "as before , the experimental results are in agreement with the theory prediction .",
    "the @xmath30 measurement is systematics - limited , with the dominant uncertainties coming from the knowledge of @xmath29 and @xmath43 , and the renormalization and factorization scale . by contrast , the @xmath31 measurement is statistics - limited .",
    "run i at the tevatron has produced a trove of knowledge about the @xmath3 and @xmath6 bosons , as evidenced by the new cdf measurement of the @xmath3 angular - decay distributions .",
    "these sophisticated analyses will be completed soon .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations are now turning their attention to the run ii data , and their @xmath3 and @xmath6-based analyses are underway .",
    "both experiments have established techniques to identify the bosons with high efficiency .",
    "they have a good understanding of the acceptances and efficiencies of their detector , and this understanding will improve as more data are collected .",
    "the @xmath3 cross - section measurements are consistent with the theory predictions and expectations from earlier measurements , and are already systematics - limited .",
    "measurements of the @xmath6 cross section and @xmath44 tend to be statistics - limited , but that too will change as the datasets grow .",
    "this work provides a solid foundation for the studies of high-@xmath45 physics that are among the goals of run ii .",
