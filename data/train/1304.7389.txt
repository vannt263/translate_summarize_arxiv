    "these data sample only a small spectral window around a limited number of individual lines but with higher spectral sampling and somewhat higher sensitivity , which facilitates the detection of weak lines .",
    "full pacs spectral scans have been performed within wish for four class 0 sources @xcite .",
    "pacs is a 5@xmath205 array of 9.4@xmath209.4  spatial pixels ( hereinafter referred to as `` spaxels '' ) covering the spectral range from 50 - 210 @xmath8 m with @xmath21/@xmath22 @xmath10 1000 - 3000 , divided into four segments , covering @xmath23 50 - 75 , 70 - 105 , 100 - 145 , and 140 - 210 @xmath8 m .",

    "the nominal pointing rms of the telescope is 2@xmath11 .",
    "however , targets observed during certain periods show consistently greater offsets ( see below ) .    for the digit embedded sources sample we utilized the full range of pacs ( 50 - 210 @xmath8 m ) in two linked pointed chop / nod rangescans : a blue scan covering 50 - 75 and 100 - 150 @xmath8 m ( sed b2a + short r1 ) ; and a red scan covering 70 - 105 and 140 - 210 @xmath8 m ( sed b2b + long r1 ) .",
    "we used 6 and 4 range repetitions respectively , for integration times of 6853 and 9088 seconds ( a total of @xmath10 16000 seconds per target for the entire 50 - 210 @xmath8 m scan ) ; excluding overhead , 50% of the integration time is spent onsource and on sky .",
    "thus the effective on - source integration times are 3088 and 4180 seconds , for the blue and red scans , respectively .",
    "the total on - source integration time to achieve the entire 50 - 210 @xmath8 m scan is then 7268 seconds .",
    "the telescope and sky background emission was subtracted using two nod positions 6  from the source in opposite directions . the telescope chopped between the source and nod positions , cycling every 1/8 of a second in a pre - determined pattern of on and off positions @xcite during the integration .",
    "the hifi observations targeting the h@xmath0o 1@xmath181@xmath19 line at 556.9 ghz were made with the wide - band spectrograph ( wbs ) and high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) in band 1b .",
    "the range of observed frequencies is 554.6 to 558.6 ghz ( lower sideband ) and 566.6 to 570.6 ghz ( upper sideband ) .",
    "the observations were executed in single point mode using position switching with a 30  offset in both right ascension and declination and the total integration time was 1144 seconds per observation , with an effective on - source integration time of 318.6 seconds .",
    "the beamsize of hifi is diffraction limited at this frequency ( @xmath10 39@xmath11 ; @xcite ) , and the uncertainty in frequency is less than 100 khz , or 0.05 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the hifi data are reduced in a manner similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the spectra were reduced in hipe ( _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ) v6.0 @xcite and exported to the `` class '' analysis package for further reduction and analysis .",
    "the reduction consisted of subtracting linear baselines and averaging data from the h- and v - polarizations , the latter only after visual inspection of the data from the two polarizations . a main beam efficiency of 0.75 @xcite is adopted to convert from antenna temperature ( @xmath24 ) to main beam temperature ( @xmath25 ) , and integration over the line yields a value for the integrated intensity ( @xmath26 d@xmath27 ) .",
    "the final spectral rms noise is 813 mk for a binsize of 0.3 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we have two primary science goals for the digit embedded sources sample .",
    "first , we want to produce the most reliable spectral energy distributions ( sed ) to inform models , better constraining source temperature and density profiles . for this purpose ,",
    "our criteria are : ( a ) the best match between spectral modules and ( b ) the best consistency with photometric measurements .",
    "second , we want to measure linefluxes for as many gas lines as possible to constrain excitation conditions and chemical evolution of the gas phase emission . for this goal ,",
    "our main criterion is the best signal - to - noise ratio in narrow wavelength regions around lines . in the future ,",
    "we hope to study weaker , broader features in the continuum emission that may constrain refractory dust and ice components , but the data reduction quality is not yet capable of this last point .",
    "after extensive tests of various reduction methods with different versions of the hipe program , we found that two different methods and hipe versions ( 6.0 and 8.0 ) performed best in meeting the separate goals of achieving the most accurate sed and the best signal - to - noise ratio for line emission .",
    "we combined the best features of both to get well - calibrated , low - noise linefluxes , as we summarize below ; the full description may be found in appendix a.    first , we apply a modified pipeline based on the default data reduction script for that version of hipe .",
    "we used an oversampling rate of 2 ( closely matching the raw data sampling rate , with 2 pixels per resolution element ) in all sources except for our science demonstration phase target , dk cha , for which we used an oversampling of 1 .",
    "this target was observed in a slightly different setup not sufficiently sampled in wavelength to use an oversampling of 2 ; all of the other sources are nyquist sampled",
    ". this process yields spectral cubes for each nod position , which are then averaged to produce the final pipeline data product .    at the edges of each segment , the noise increased greatly and the overall calibration became very erratic ( @xmath21 @xmath28 53.5 @xmath8 m , and 95.0 @xmath8 m @xmath28 @xmath21 @xmath28 102.5 @xmath8 m ) due to decreased sensitivity and order confusion . at the longest wavelengths of pacs ( @xmath21 @xmath9 190 @xmath8 m ) , echoes of spectral lines appear at twice their actual wavelength , a side - effect of light leakage from the short wavelengths , combined with decreased sensitivity on the edge of the array .",
    "thus neither the continuum nor the line emission is reliable at these wavelengths , and detections in these ranges are not further considered in this paper ; a discussion can be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "after this point , we used two different procedures , optimized to produce the best results for continuum and lines , respectively .",
    "this dual procedure was necessary to produce reliable absolute flux calibration , while also obtaining the best s / n on continuum and lines . for convenience , we refer to these two reductions as the `` bgcal '' ( background calibrated ; best for absolute flux calibration ) and `` calblock '' ( calibration block ; best for s / n , or point - to - point flux calibration ) spectra .",
    "these two processes are described in detail in appendix a.1 and a.2 . in the next two subsections",
    ", we summarize the analysis , including the post - processing needed to deal with the point - source profile ( psf ) and extended emission , first for continuum and then for lines .      the purpose of the steps described here is to produce a spectral energy distribution that can be compared to existing photometry and used to calibrate linefluxes derived from the other reduction .",
    "this process used the bgcal reduction , within hipe 6.0 .",
    "the individual steps in the reduction are detailed in appendix a.3 . in summary",
    ", we calibrate linefluxes from regions of good signal - to - noise to a separate determination of the absolute flux level and spectral shape , noting and accounting for extended emission and mispointing effects . in the most complicated fields , we defer full analysis to individual source papers , as noted below .",
    "first , we determined the centroid position of the continuum ( using the hipe 6.0 reduction ) for two wavelength regions in each segment , selected to avoid detectable line emission . using maps of these regions",
    ", we were able to interpolate a peak position to within 0.2 spaxel widths .",
    "we find by this method that most of the sources have continuum centroids that fall between 02 and 3.0  of the center coordinates , with the majority landing within 2  ( 0.2 spaxel widths ) of the center .",
    "for those sources , the pointing is consistent between the `` blue '' and `` red '' observations , independent observations executed at different times .",
    "second , in order to produce a spectrum with the best s / n and an accurate absolute flux density , we chose two apertures for each spectrum : a smaller aperture ( @xmath29 ) chosen for the best s / n , and a larger aperture ( @xmath30 ) that included all of the source flux for calibration . to do this , we summed the flux in spaxels containing high - s / n spectra of the source continuum , producing a single spectrum .    in most cases",
    ", we simply use the central spaxel for this purpose . for some sources we measured a centroid offset from the center of greater than 0.2 spaxels .",
    "in particular , the series of digit observations taken between 29 march and 02 april 2010 were consistently offset by 6 , generally to the upper left of the central spaxel . in these cases",
    "we extracted a 2@xmath202 spaxel area centered on the apparent centroid location of the central source from the pacs continuum emission , and scaled it to the full 25 spaxel continuum values .",
    "we applied this technique to dk cha , tmr 1 , and l1527 ( table [ obslog ] ) . in the case of tmc 1a , which was slightly less offset",
    ", we used only the two brightest spaxels for the centroid .",
    "third , we determined the largest set of spaxels containing the source without contamination from other sources in the field - of - view ; in most cases this was the full 5@xmath205 array , but in some cases we selected a smaller set of spaxels ( see section on extended emission , below ) .",
    "we then computed the flux density summed over these spaxels ( the total flux ) .",
    "fourth , we fitted a 2nd ( or smaller ) order polynomial scaling factor in wavelength , determined from the ratio of the flux density in the larger aperture to that in the smaller aperture .",
    "then we scaled the spectrum by this correction factor .",
    "this correction is applied module - by - module ( e.g. a separate polynomial for each range of 50 - 75 , 70 - 95 , 100 - 145 , and 145 - 190 @xmath8 m ) . after scaling @xmath29 to @xmath30 , the two `` blue '' ( 50 - 75 and 70 - 95 @xmath8 m ) and",
    "the two `` red '' ( 100 - 145 and 145 - 190 @xmath8 m ) modules were generally well - aligned with each other ( less than 5% difference on average ) , but retained the s / n of @xmath29 .",
    "unfortunately , even after applying this entire procedure ,",
    "@xmath30(red ) @xmath9 @xmath30(blue ) in all cases , a systematic discontinuity at 100 @xmath8 m for every source .",
    "this jump was not uniform ; it is most problematic for faint continuum sources irs63 , iras 03301 , b1-a , l1014 , and wl12 .",
    "ultimately the seds will benefit from comparison to pacs photometry .    furthermore , there are a few cases where the reduction process did not produce a smooth continuum across modules even within the `` blue '' or `` red '' halves . in cases with a significant misalignment , as an optional sixth step",
    "we apply an additional correction .",
    "the sources that are significantly misaligned between modules are serpens - smm3 and smm4 , rcra - irs5a , 7b , irs 46 , l1551-irs5 , l1455-irs3 , and l1014 .",
    "the serpens and r cra sources are in highly confused regions ; an analysis of pacs 70/100/160 @xmath8 m imaging can be found in @xcite .",
    "serpens - smm3 is the most problematic ; the b2a / short r1 observation is 30% higher than the b2b / long r1 observation , probably an effect of the complicated interaction between the extended emission in the region , and the psf ; once again we scaled the b2a / short r1 spectrum up by 30% .",
    "irs46 is complicated by emission from the much brighter nearby source irs 44 .",
    "the l1551-irs5 b2a / short r1 observation is 10% higher than the b2b / long r1 observation , which was observed 1.5 years later .",
    "we scaled up the b2b / long r1 by 10% to match the b2a / short r1 data , for the continuum seds . l1455-irs3 and l1014",
    "are only marginally detected in continuum ; thus when scaling to the full array the noise becomes comparable to the signal , causing the scaling to become unreliable . in this case",
    "we scaled the brightest module ( the blue half of each observation ) to the full array as usual and then scaled the red halves upward by a factor of 2 to match the blue .",
    "this exercise shows that in the case of very faint sources absolute calibration using the full array becomes unreliable .",
    "no other additional continuum scaling was performed on any of the other sources in the sample after this point .    in a few cases",
    ", we observed clear evidence of _ multiple _ emitting sources within the pacs field - of - view . in the case of vla 1623 - 243",
    "we detected a clear second source to the northeast edge of the grid ( appendix b , fig .",
    "[ spatial8 ] ) , and avoided the emission from those spaxels .",
    "this is consistent with the emission from the oph - a ridge detected in scuba maps @xcite .",
    "irs 46 is well - centered , but by design irs 44 occupies only the southwestern 3 spaxels in the map , which greatly underestimates the true flux density of irs 44 and distorts the spectral shape . in these cases , we selected spaxels most likely to be attributable to the target source .",
    "we extracted the central source , and scaled to the flux in the spaxels clearly attributed to that source ; in some cases this amounted to only 60% of the spaxels . in the case of irs 44",
    "we extracted the flux from only the southwestern 3 spaxels . in the complicated serpens - smm3/4 and the rcra - irs7b/7c fields we observed significant extended diffuse emission contributing to the flux .",
    "we therefore calibrated these to flux density per pixel and detailed analysis will be presented by dionatos et al .",
    "( subm . ) and lindberg et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "in the case of l1448-mm , we were able to decompose the flux based on resolved observations at shorter wavelengths ( see the section on continuum analysis for further detail , and lee et al .",
    ", subm . ) .",
    "comparison to previous photometry in the pacs wavelength range is problematic .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "beam was much larger , and mips data often suffered from saturation on these sources .",
    "the typical mips 70 @xmath8 m flux density is almost always low compared to the pacs spectra extracted from the full array by @xmath10 20% , except in the brighter half of our sample , where the mips value is even lower  a factor of two  compared to the _ herschel _ data .    instead , we compared seds from this reduction method to pacs photometry of disk sources , obtained in the gasps ( pi : w. dent ) key program .",
    "these isolated point sources provide a better photometric test than the extended , embedded sources .",
    "we convolved our seds to the transmission curve for each pacs photometric filter and compared the photometry to the resulting spectrophotometry ( table [ specphot ] ) .",
    "we found the best agreement with hipe 6.0 using the bgcal reduction , for which we found the following average factors for photometry / spectrophotometry : @xmath31 at 70 @xmath8 m , and @xmath32 at 160 @xmath8 m , where the second number is the standard deviation over 10 sources .",
    "eventually , pacs photometry for our embedded sources should become available from other programs .",
    "for now , we were able to compare to pacs photometry for one embedded source , b335 ( a. stutz , priv .",
    "2012 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the seds derived from various combinations of spaxels ( central spaxel only , central 3@xmath203 spaxels , and total from all spaxels ) are compared to pacs photometry in apertures set to match the solid angle in figure [ b335specphot ] ; e.g. circular apertures of radius 53 , 159 , and 265 , equivalent to 94 ( black - blue ) , 282 ( dark blue ) , and 470 ( light blue ) squares .",
    "the spectral flux density at 100 @xmath8 m was determined from a linear interpolation between the average flux density in the 9495 @xmath8 m , and 104105 @xmath8 m ranges .",
    "the agreement is good to 10% , except for the central spaxel , where the photometric aperture size ( 106 diameter ) is very close to the beamsize at 100 @xmath8 m ( @xmath10 10 ) and much less than the beamsize at 160 @xmath8 m ( @xmath10 14 ) . the extent of the source is well reflected in the rise of flux density as we add increasing numbers of spaxels , but the images show that the emission continues to still larger scales .",
    "if this situation is general , our seds will underestimate the total flux from the source .",
    "our reduction technique for lines utilizes hipe 6.0 _ and _ hipe v8.0.2489 with the `` calibration block '' , referred to as the `` calblock '' reduction , which multiplies the chopped spectrum by a similar spectrum of an on - board calibration source .",
    "it works in a similar fashion to the continuum procedure , but with several key differences .",
    "the steps in the reduction are detailed in appendix a.4 .",
    "our objective here is to measure line equivalent widths ( ) for gas phase lines , which are spectrally unresolved , or in a few cases , perhaps slightly resolved .",
    "this reduction produced the lowest local ( point - to - point ) noise but larger shifts between modules and an overall calibration less consistent with photometry .",
    "tests indicate that the equivalent width of lines is independent of reduction .",
    "consequently , we use the calblock reduction to define the equivalent width of lines and then use the bgcal reduction of the same spectral region to convert to linefluxes .",
    "this process allows us to combine the best signal - to - noise on the equivalent width from hipe 8.0.v2489 with the best overall line flux calibration using hipe 6.0 .",
    "the first step is to extract linefluxes from the hipe 8 calblock reduction using a narrow region to define the continuum ( ) and calculate the .",
    "we utilized a modified version of the smart reduction package @xcite to fit gaussians and first or second - order baselines to the spectra to remove local continuum features .",
    "the lamda database of lines @xcite , supplemented by hitran @xcite , was used to identify the features .",
    "the fit for the line center varies only by 0.01 @xmath8 m or less for our different extraction methods ( 10 - 20% of a resolution element ) ; therefore the fit uncertainty in velocity space is @xmath10 30 - 50 km s@xmath14 .",
    "line centers usually lie within 50 km s@xmath14 of the theoretical line center from laboratory measurements . at our level of precision",

    "however , the location of the source within each slit also affects the velocity .",
    "the uncertainty in  caused by the fit is quite small ( s / n ratios as high as 300 were obtained on bright lines , particularly ) , but for faint lines , the uncertainty rises to 20% . in this treatment we do not include lines within the masked wavelength regions ( @xmath28 55 @xmath8 m , 95102.5 @xmath8 m , @xmath9 190 @xmath8 m ) as they exhibit large calibration uncertainties .",
    "the one exception is the co line at 96.77 @xmath8 m ; the local rms uncertainty is somewhat larger than , but still comparable to , the local continuum surrounding the co line at 93.3 @xmath8 m , and we only include this line in sources with confirmed detections of co lines at shorter wavelengths",
    ". the line does not significantly affect the derived source properties in the following sections .",
    "second , the linefluxes were corrected for psf and extended emission . as with the continuum , simply adding all the spaxels caused a serious loss of signal - to - noise and a diminished rate of line detection , and the psf correction provided in the standard pipeline does not account for extended emission .",
    "thus we do _ not _ use the psf correction function , but instead compare the flux over different sized apertures to determine an empirical correction for each source . in order to do this , we measured the lineflux , ( sm ) , in the central spaxel ( or a sum over a few spaxels for poorly centered sources ) that gave the best signal - to - noise on relatively strong lines . mathematically , the process is identical to the continuum , except for lineflux rather than flux density .",
    "additionally , we correct the fluxes by the ratio between the bgcal and calblock local continuum for each individual line . because the spatial distribution of line emission could in principle differ from that of the continuum , we did not simply scale the value in the central spaxel by the continuum ratios . to determine the total linefluxes , ( lg )",
    ", we applied a polynomial correction , developed by comparing the spectral lineflux detected in the central spaxel compared to that in the surrounding spaxels for strong lines  mostly co lines , but also including strong h@xmath0o lines , a technique developed by @xcite .",
    "we did not include the 63 and 145 @xmath8 m  lines in this correction , because they were frequently extended compared to these species and to the psf ( see section [ reduccont ] ) .",
    "weaker lines of all species were then scaled with the same factors .",
    "this method assumes that weak and strong lines have similar spatial distributions . in figure",
    "[ extendedlines ] , we plot linefluxes of all species measured from 3@xmath203 spaxel regions vs. linefluxes contained within just the central spaxel , for four well - pointed sources .",
    "for each source we fit a constant ratio from 50 - 100 @xmath8 m , and a first order polynomial from 100 - 200 @xmath8 m , a simplified fitted version of the psf correction , to the bright co and h@xmath0o lines . for this exercise we set a minimum correction factor of 1.4 to the 50 - 100 @xmath8 m fit , approximately the psf correction .",
    "although additional lines are plotted , they are not considered in the fit . in the first two cases ( l1489 and elias 29 ) , the pipeline - provided psf correction ( dashed line ) is very similar to the analytical correction . in elias 29 ,",

    ", we find that all line ratios significantly exceed the psf correction , suggesting a substantial contribution from extended and/or diffuse emission in the field - of - view . in gss30-irs1",
    ", we find that the long wavelength line emission exceeds the psf , as does the continuum ; at short wavelengths the  line is far more extended than the molecular emission or the continuum ( see below ) .",
    "this may be associated with an hco@xmath33 flow extending to the ne from the source position @xcite .    in cases",
    "for which we lack sufficient strong lines to determine the correction , we use a linear approximation to the psf correction .",

    "we also correct irs 44 with the psf , but note that the final derived flux is still close to an order of magnitude too low , judging by the _ spitzer _",
    "spectra and long wavelength photometry .",
    "this is due to the position of the source just off the edge of the pacs footprint ; we do not fully see the source peak and lose substantial flux .",
    "we measured the continuum rms in selected ( line - free ) portions of the spectrum .",
    "the measured rms uncertainties are dominated by three factors .",

    "figure [ unc1 ] shows the rms uncertainties vs. wavelength for a line - rich source ( elias 29 ) separated by order , for both co and h@xmath0o lines , using fitted gaussian linewidths .",
    "the uncertainties in flux are independent of species ( unsurprisingly ) and broadly decrease with increasing wavelength , discontinuously at the order boundaries .",
    "portions of the spectra within 5 @xmath8 m of the order edges have far higher uncertainties .",
    "finally , we show the rms uncertainties for the 63 @xmath8 m  line across the full digit sample , against the local continuum flux . above a certain continuum strength ",

    "we discuss here some simple metrics regarding spatial extent and discuss a few examples of interesting structure .",

    "signs of extended emission are seen in both line and continuum in some sources , and the line emission is not always coupled to the continuum , but many sources are essentially pointlike at _ herschel _ wavelengths . to simplify the comparison , we consider only the 15 sources in our sample that are well - centered ( we exclude dk cha , tmr1 , tmc1a , l1527 , and irs 44 ) , lack clear evidence for multiple , spatially separated emission peaks at the resolution of _ herschel _ ( we exclude serpens - smm3/4 , rcra - irs5a/7b/7c , l1448-mm , and irs 46 ) , and have sufficient flux density to be detectable in continuum at all pacs wavelengths ( we exclude l1455-irs3 , l1014 , and iram 04191 ) .",

    "thus a source must be more extended to exceed the psf at longer wavelengths and appear extended in our data . the ratio of the continuum flux density in the full 3@xmath203 spaxel array to the emission from the central spaxel averages @xmath60 ( median 1.79 ) at 63 @xmath8 m , the average being higher by a factor of 1.28 than the psf correction factor of 1.43 . at 163 @xmath8 m the ratio averages @xmath61 ( median 2.55 ) , with the average a factor of 1.51 higher than the psf correction factor of 2.04 . on average ( and median )",
    "our sources are marginally extended , and more extended at the longer wavelengths .",

    "[ extended ] and [ extended2 ] , we only include formal errors in the local continuum rms ; the overall calibration uncertainties may be much higher , including photometric calibration and spaxel - to - spaxel variation .",
    "if we assume the uncertainty in the 3@xmath203 and the central spaxel continuum is dominated by the photometric uncertainty ( @xmath10 20% ) , then adding this to the ratio in quadrature , we would expect the ratio to be uncertain by @xmath10 28% .",

    "the trend to larger sizes , relative to a point source , can also be seen in figure [ gss30cont ] for gss30-irs1 , where a trend toward displacement of the emission centroid toward the north - east with increasing wavelength can be seen .",

    "the  partially tracks extended outflow emission around l1551-irs5 , while the co is more compact .",

    "we can discern significant spatial differences between  and the molecular species .",
    "for example , gss30-irs1 ( figure [ gss30lines ] ) shows compact , well - centered emission for all the lines except , which is extended and peaks toward the northeast , similar to but more strongly than the continuum at long wavelengths ( figure [ gss30cont ] ) .",

    "if the lower excitation lines become optically thick , the state populations derived from the optically thin approximation would exhibit curvature and diverge from the fitted line .",
    "if the higher excitation lines are sub - thermally populated , the derived state populations may fall below the fitted line ( @xcite , figure 6 ) . the direct correspondence between  and the wavelength of the transition simplifies the analysis , in the case of co ; neither of these effects is seen in co rotation diagrams for this sample .",
    "it should be noted that if _ all _ lines are sub - thermally excited ( for very low densities ) , the curvature becomes positive and the state populations may fall above the fitted line @xcite .",
    "we consider the fits to rotation diagrams across the sample . in summary , while we fit both warm and hot components to the co diagrams , we never observe the hot component in absence of the warm , and both components scale in proportion to the bolometric luminosity of the system .",

    "all co lines are at least 3@xmath65 detections .    of the 10 sources with fitted hot components , the ratio of molecules in the warm component is 5 - 10 times that of the hot component , but in 2 cases ( b335 and l1448-mm ) , we find a relatively small hot component .",
    "b335 is a likely outlier because we detect only six co lines in the hot component , leading to very uncertain fits .",
    "this is not the case for l1448-mm , which has one of the richest co spectra in the sample ; this may reflect a larger emitting region of warm gas compared to the hot gas , consistent with the source line map shown in appendix b of this work .",
    "l1551-irs5 has a higher warm ( co ) than the rest of the sample , at 589 @xmath1 335 k ; it also has a relatively low line - to - continuum ratio and shows little emission from molecules other than co. across the sample , the total number of co molecules in warm and hot components ,   ( excluding the r cra and serpens sources and those sources with no detectable co component ) ranges from 0.02 - 4.56 @xmath20 10@xmath78 molecules , with @xmath79 .",
    "fitting two components with a breakpoint to co rotation diagrams is a common approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however the analysis is not qualitatively affected by moving the breakpoint by @xmath80 transitions in either direction .",
    "shifting the breakpoint to a lower excitation will cause both temperatures to decrease , and both  to increase ( table [ breakpoint ] ) .    as noted above",

    "the parameter to determine the uniform wavelength coverage is referred to as `` oversampling ''  the pixels in the reduced data covering each resolution element .",
    "we used an oversampling rate of 2 , closely matching the sampling rate of the raw pacs data , with an exception in the case of our science demonstration phase data for dk cha .",
    "this object was observed using a slightly different setup not sufficiently sampled in wavelength , and we reduced our oversample to 1 .",
    "this process yields two spectral cubes ( ` rebinned cubes ' ) consisting of 5 @xmath20 5 spaxels for each wavelength , over a uniform set of wavelengths covering the entire module , for each nod position .",
    "the nod averaged product ( ` finalcube ' ) is the average of the two nods and is the final standard data product from the pipeline .",
    "the relative spectral response function was determined before launch but modified using calibration data taken in the early phases of the mission , from observations of neptune , to yield a flux density in jansky ( jy ) .",
    "after this point , we used two different procedures , optimized to produce the best results for continuum and lines , respectively .",
    "this dual procedure was necessary to produce reliable absolute flux calibration , while also obtaining the best s / n on continuum and lines . for convenience , we refer to these two reductions as the `` bgcal '' ( background calibrated ; best for absolute flux calibration ) and `` calblock '' ( calibration block ; best for s / n ) spectra .",
    "first , we determined the centroid position of the continuum ( using the hipe 6.0 reduction ) for two wavelength regions in each segment , selected to avoid detectable line emission . using maps of these regions",
    ", we were able to interpolate a peak position to within 0.2 spaxel widths .",
    "we find by this method that most of the sources have continuum centroids that fall between 02 and 3.0  of the center coordinates , with the majority landing within 2  ( 0.2 spaxel widths ) of the center .",
    "for those sources , the pointing is consistent between the `` blue '' and `` red '' observations , independent observations executed at different times .",
    "second , in order to produce a spectrum with the best s / n and an accurate absolute flux density , we chose two apertures for each spectrum : a smaller aperture ( @xmath29 ) chosen for the best s / n , and a larger aperture ( @xmath30 ) that included all of the source flux for calibration . to do this",
    ", we determined by inspection which spaxels contained high - s / n spectra of the source continuum and summed the flux in those spaxels , producing a single spectrum :    @xmath124    in most cases , we simply use the central spaxel for this purpose .",
    "for some sources we measured a centroid offset from the center of greater than 0.2 spaxels ; in these cases we include additional spaxels with significant continuum .",
    "third , we determined the largest set of spaxels containing the source without contamination from other sources in the field - of - view ; in most cases this was the full 5@xmath205 array , but in some cases we selected a smaller set of spaxels ( see section on extended emission , below ) .",
    "we then computed the flux density summed over these spaxels ( the total flux ) , @xmath30 :    @xmath125    fourth , we fitted a 2nd ( or smaller ) order polynomial scaling factor in wavelength , determined from the ratio of the flux density in the larger aperture ( s@xmath126 ) to that in the smaller aperture ( s@xmath127 ) :    @xmath128    where @xmath21 is wavelength , and a , b , and c are fitted constants .",
    "fifth , we scale @xmath29 to @xmath30 using this correction factor :    @xmath129    this correction is applied module - by - module ( e.g. a separate polynomial for each range of 50 - 75 , 70 - 95 , 100 - 145 , and 145 - 190 @xmath8 m ) . after scaling @xmath29 to @xmath30 , the two `` blue '' ( 50 - 75 and 70 - 95 @xmath8 m ) and the two `` red '' ( 100 - 145 and 145 - 190 @xmath8 m ) modules were generally well - aligned with each other ( less than 5% difference on average ) , but retained the s / n of @xmath29 . unfortunately , even after applying this entire procedure ,",

    "our reduction technique for lines utilizes hipe 6.0 _ and _ hipe v8.0.2489 with the `` calibration block '' , referred to as the `` calblock '' reduction , which multiplies the chopped spectrum by a similar spectrum of an on - board calibration source .",
    "it works in a similar fashion to the continuum procedure , but with several key differences .",
    "our objective here is to measure line equivalent widths ( ) for gas phase lines , which are spectrally unresolved , or in a few cases , perhaps slightly resolved .",
    "this reduction produced the lowest local ( point - to - point ) noise but larger shifts between modules and an overall calibration less consistent with photometry .",
    "tests indicate that the equivalent width of lines is independent of reduction .",
    "consequently , we use the calblock reduction to define the equivalent width of lines and then use the bgcal reduction of the same spectral region to convert to linefluxes . mathematically , the process is as follows :    @xmath130    where  is the adjacent continuum flux density , with units of , and  is the lineflux , with units of , followed by    @xmath131    the first step is to extract linefluxes from the hipe 8 calblock reduction using a narrow region to define the continuum ( ) and calculate the .",
    "we utilized a modified version of the smart reduction package @xcite to fit gaussians and first or second - order baselines to the spectra to remove local continuum features .",
    "the lamda database of lines @xcite , supplemented by hitran @xcite , was used to identify the features .",
    "the fit for the line center varies only by 0.01 @xmath8 m or less for our different extraction methods ( 10 - 20% of a resolution element ) ; therefore the fit uncertainty in velocity space is @xmath10 30 - 50 km s@xmath14 .",
    "line centers usually lie within 50 km s@xmath14 of the theoretical line center from laboratory measurements . at our level of precision",
    ", we do not observe believable shifts in our data ; nonetheless , this is still consistent with shifts observed in other datasets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the location of the source within each slit also affects the velocity .",
    "the uncertainty in  caused by the fit is quite small ( s / n ratios as high as 300 were obtained on bright lines , particularly ) , but for faint lines , the uncertainty rises to 20% . in this treatment we do not include lines within the masked wavelength regions ( @xmath28 55 @xmath8 m , 95102.5 @xmath8 m , @xmath9 190 @xmath8 m ) as they exhibit large calibration uncertainties .",
    "the one exception is the co line at 96.77 @xmath8 m ; the local rms uncertainty is somewhat larger than , but still comparable to , the local continuum surrounding the co line at 93.3 @xmath8 m , and we only include this line in sources with confirmed detections of co lines at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the line does not significantly affect the derived source properties in the following sections .",
    "second , the linefluxes were corrected for psf and extended emission . as with the continuum , simply adding all the spaxels caused a serious loss of signal - to - noise and a diminished rate of line detection , and the psf correction provided in the standard pipeline does not account for extended emission .",
    "thus we do _ not _ use the psf correction function , but instead compare the flux over different sized apertures to determine an empirical correction for each source . in order to do this , we measured the lineflux , ( sm ) , in the central spaxel ( or a sum over a few spaxels for poorly centered sources ) that gave the best signal - to - noise on relatively strong lines . mathematically , the process is identical to the continuum , except for lineflux rather than flux density :    @xmath132    where i is the set of spaxels with good signal - to - noise on all lines .",
    "additionally , we correct the fluxes by the ratio between the bgcal and calblock local continuum for each individual line . because the spatial distribution of line emission could in principle differ from that of the continuum , we did not simply scale the value in the central spaxel by the continuum ratios . to determine the total linefluxes , ( lg )",
    ", we applied a polynomial correction , developed by comparing the spectral lineflux detected in the central spaxel compared to that in the surrounding spaxels for strong lines  mostly co lines , but also including strong h@xmath0o lines .",
    "we did not include the 63 and 145 @xmath8 m  lines in this correction , because they were frequently extended compared to these species and to the psf ( see section [ reduccont ] ) .",
    "weaker lines of all species were then scaled with the same factors .",
    "mathematically , the procedure is similar to the correction to the continuum .",
    "first , the linefluxes , measured originally from the calblock reduction , are scaled to the bgcal level .",
    "then , as for continuum we derive the small aperture lineflux ( @xmath133 , typically the central spaxel ) and the large aperture ( @xmath134 )",
    ". then we correct the final linefluxes ( @xmath135 ) by a first - order polynomial fitted to the ratio of the fluxes in the apertures .",
    "we only summed over the central 3@xmath203 spaxels to calculate ( lg ) , rather than the full ( 5@xmath205 ) array .",
    "mathematically :    @xmath136    where i is the index of the spaxels falling within the large aperture .",
    "@xmath137    @xmath138    this method assumes that weak and strong lines have similar spatial distributions . in figure",
    "[ extendedlines ] , we plot linefluxes of all species measured from 3@xmath203 spaxel regions vs. linefluxes contained within just the central spaxel , for four well - pointed sources . for each source we fit a constant ratio from 50 - 100 @xmath8 m , and a first order polynomial from 100 - 200 @xmath8 m , a simplified fitted version of the psf correction , to the bright co and h@xmath0o lines .",
    "for this exercise we set a minimum correction factor of 1.4 to the 50 - 100 @xmath8 m fit , approximately the psf correction .",
    "although additional lines are plotted , they are not considered in the fit . in cases",
    "for which we lack sufficient strong lines to determine the correction , we use a linear approximation to the psf correction .",
    "the hipe pipeline is a python script that executes java modules line - by - line in the interactive environment . the `` flux calibrated '' version of our script uses calibration sets that were part of hipe 6.0 . the steps executed in the pipeline",
    "are as follows , through level 0 ( raw data ) , level 0.5 ( sliced data frames ) , level 1 ( the datacubes at the raw , non - uniform wavelength sampling ) and level 2 ( the final datacubes after wavelength calibration , rebinning , nod averaging ) .",

    "a differential signal is computed for each on / off - position pair of datapoints , for each chopper cycle .",
    "then the spectrum is divided by the relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) , and the nominal response function , in effect a flatfielding correction utilizing calibration observations of neptune and vesta .",
    "this is then recorded as a `` pacscube '' dataproduct , which contains the spectrum _",
    "prior _ to wavelength calibration , rebinning and nod averaging ; this is the level 1 product .",
    "the last set of pipeline subroutines takes the level 1 product to level 2 .",
    "a user - selected `` oversampling '' parameter is used to rebin to a uniform spectral resolution .",
    "an oversample of 2 indicates that the data are binned so that each resolution element is covered by 2 pixels in the reduced data .",
    "outliers are flagged with sigma - clipping in the wavelength domain .",
    "the `` rebinnedcube '' product is the output of this routine , a spectrum for each nod - difference spectrum . in the standard chop - nod setting , this produces two spectra .",

    "a post - hipe routine is used to convert this to a datacube for final analysis .",
    "the best signal - to - noise is in most cases generated using the current pipeline calibration set from hipe 8.0.2489 .",
