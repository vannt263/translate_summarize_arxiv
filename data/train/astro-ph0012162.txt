    "previous high resolution observations of the 3c 273 jet using merlin at 1.647 ghz and the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field planetary camera 2 @xcite showed that the overall shape of the jet is somewhat different between the optical and radio bands .",
    "the optical image appears dominated by elongated knots roughly 0.1  by 0.5  in size , while the radio image gives an indication of a `` cocoon '' structure , especially at the end , or `` head '' .",
    "bahcall et al .  speculated that the cocoon is slowly moving material enveloping a relativistically moving flow .",
    "although relativistic motion is required to explain superluminal motion in the quasar core , it is not yet clear that the flow is relativistic in the jet on a kpc scale .",
    "@xcite used the _ einstein _",
    "observatory data on 3c 273 to detect x - ray emission from the jet , which was less than 1% of the flux of the core .",
    "more recently , @xcite , examined rosat hri images at @xmath6 5resolution to show that the x - ray emission drops with distance along the jet .",
    "using models of the profile along the jet and multi - color ground - based images at 1.3  resolution , they generated spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for knots in the jet and found that the x - ray flux of knot a1 ) .",
    "] is consistent with that expected by extrapolating a simple synchrotron model from the radio through the optical with one population of electrons .",
    "the highest energy electrons in their model had @xmath7 .",
    "synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) calculations generally fail to predict x - ray intensities commensurate with those observed for any of the knots .",
    "x - ray images with the chandra x - ray observatory are now resolving the spatial structure along quasar jets .",
    "the first such image , of the quasar pks  0637752 , proved remarkable because of the strong x - ray fluxes of the jet knots , relative to the radio fluxes @xcite .",
    "simple synchrotron and thermal models could be ruled out easily while ssc models required unreasonable conditions . @xcite and @xcite have suggested that inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background could produce the required x - ray fluxes and require the jet material to be moving relativistically at a small angle to the line of sight as in models of the core .",
    "we present chandra images and spectra for the jet in 3c 273 that we examine in light of these models .",
    "3c 273 was observed three times as part of the calibration of the chandra grating spectrometers , once in a direct imaging mode as part of science verification , and twice more as the gratings failed to insert during calibration observations .",
    "see table  [ tab-3c ] for a list of observations , totalling 193,230 s of exposure time .",
    "results from the dispersed spectra of the core are still being analyzed as part of the ongoing effort to verify the grating spectrometer effective area calibration and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) and high resolution camera ( hrc ) combination gave significantly fewer counts in the jet compared to the others , so was not used in the combined x - ray image .",
    "we present here the results from the zeroth order portion of the acis grating observations and combine these data with that of the hrc - i and acis - s imaging observations for image analysis .",
    "the dispersed spectra of the jet were extremely faint ; we determined that there were no significant emission lines and did not examine these data any further .",
    "each of the grating observations had well - known artifacts that distort the zeroth order images .",
    "two artifacts are relevant to observations of the jet .",
    "bright sources observed with acis will show up with a `` readout streak '' ( see the chandra proposers observatory guide , or pog ) . in no acis observation , however , did the streak affect the image of the jet .",
    "the letg has two support structures that produce diffraction patterns ( see the pog ) .",
    "this pattern is spaced at 60  intervals and , again , did not interfere with the image of the jet .",
    "individual observations have slightly uncertain absolute pointing , so we repositioned each image separately .",
    "the hrc and letg / acis observations were combined by referencing to the core . due to pileup ,",
    "the two non - grating acis observations and the high energy transmission grating observations had zeroth order images that were severely affected by pileup so the first knot was used as a reference .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in this procedure gives a relative offset between the core and the jet of less than 0.05  by examining the location of the center of the wings of the core and comparing to the position of the first knot in each data set .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows the combined x - ray image binned in 0.2  pixels .",
    "the jet shows clear curvature but mostly has a one - dimensional appearance , so a profile was computed for quantitative analysis . the x - ray profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] ) was derived by summing data in a 1.5  wide window centered on a position angle of -138.0 , which is the centerline of the jet .",
    "we estimate that the correction for aperture losses is 10@xmath8 5% at any location along the jet , based on using a wider extraction region .",
    "the peak of emission occurs just under 13  from the core . fitting a gaussian profile to it ,",
    "the centroid is 1293 @xmath8 001 from the core and the dispersion of a gaussian is 033 @xmath8 001 ( for a fwhm of 0.78 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 limit to the fwhm of this knot is 03 , given that point sources have a projected fwhm of 075 , which is determined from readout streak data for the core of 3c 273 and other bright point sources .",
    "the next peak in the x - ray emission is clearly extended , from 14.0 to 15  from the core , dropping more steeply on the downstream side . from 16  to 21",
    "the x - ray emission appears somewhat devoid of distinct features but with some possible surface brightness variations ; there may be an unresolved knot at 20 .",
    "the x - ray flux reaches the background level at 21  from the nucleus .",
    "several regions were selected for x - ray spectral fitting : a ) a 1  radius circle centered on the first bright knot , b ) a similar circle centered on the extended knot at 15  and c ) a rectangular box extending from 16  to the end of the jet . the 0.5 - 8 kev acis - s spectra were combined and fitted with power law models holding @xmath10 fixed at @xmath11 @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the resultant spectral indices were @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 ) ; no spectral evolution is detected along the jet .",
    "flux densities of several knot regions are given in table  [ tab - fluxes ] .",
    "we estimate that the total jet power is about 0.4% of the core power in the 0.5 - 5.0 kev band .",
    "x - ray emission is just detectable between the core and the knot a1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : innerjet ] .",
    "the 5 - 10  annulus shows a peak at the position angle of the 10 - 20  jet in addition to peaks at the position angles of the readout streak .",
    "it is difficult to quantify precisely the flux of the inner jet due to the ripple inherent in azimuthal profiles this close to a bright source which is caused by mirror support structure .",
    "accounting for the ripple by fitting a sinusoid to the local background , we estimate that the count rate from the inner jet is about 0.012 @xmath8 0.001 count s@xmath17 , corresponding to a total flux density of 6.9 @xmath8 0.6 @xmath18jy at 1 kev for a power law spectrum with @xmath19 .",
    "x - ray components were identified using images obtained from the hst archives .",
    "fluxes were determined in filters f450w , f622w , f814w , and f160w ( nicmos ) .",
    "the planetary camera ( pc ) observation using filter f622w was used for direct comparisons to the x - ray jet profile , so the centroid of the quasar was determined by isolating the image diffraction spikes @xcite , fitting these with lines , and determining the intersection of the two lines ( only two spikes were available from this image ) .",
    "spatial distortions were corrected using polynomial coefficients given by @xcite .",
    "the optical profile was obtained using the same method as used for the x - ray profile and is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] .",
    "an offset of 0.22  was found between the centroids of the the first x - ray peak and the peak of knot a1 from the pc image .",
    "the positional uncertainty is dominated by systematic uncertainties in measurement of the quasar core , so this difference between the x - ray and optical positions of this bright knot are not likely to be significant .",
    "the optical emission of a1 is clearly extended along a position angle closely aligned to the overall pa of the jet ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) ; the profile is well fitted by a gaussian with @xmath20  which is consistent with the x - ray profile at the 2@xmath21 level .    identifying the sources of the remaining x - ray emission",
    "is not quite so straightforward as for knot a1 .",
    "region b ( the extended knot at 15  from the core ) is not consistent with a single point source at knot b1 but is likely to be a blend of point sources at knots b1 and a2 , a somewhat weaker knot in the hst image .",
    "there appears to be a discrete source of x - ray emission near the positions of knots d and h3 .",
    "more data are needed to tell if knots besides these  i.e. , c1 , c2 , and c3  are also discrete sources of x - ray emission .",
    "the overall shape of the jet is quite similar in the optical and x - ray bands : there is distinct curvature and the lengths are about the same .",
    "the optical emission between the knots is @xmath22  wide ( bahcall et al .",
    "1995 ) and the x - ray emission is marginally consistent with this level of broadening .",
    "there are several important differences , however .",
    "knot a1 is much more prominent in the x - ray data than in the optical image .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray jet fades along the jet while the optical knots have similar brightnesses .",
    "@xcite also noted this difference .",
    "the x - ray emission from knot a1 is consistent with a point source but we can not yet exclude the possibility that it is as extended as the optical emission along the jet axis .",
    "the merlin map shows that this knot is similarly extended in the 1.647 ghz band .",
    "the radio emission of the other knots is quite difficult to discern within the radio cocoon , giving rise to the impression that bulk of the radio emission is physically distinct from the optical and x - ray emission regions .",
    "we find no significant x - ray emission from either extensions ( inner or outer , see fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) , lending support to the interpretation that these are unrelated to the jet @xcite .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for knot a1 ( fig .  [ fig : sed ] ) appears to fit a simple synchrotron model , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "our estimate for the x - ray flux density is @xmath23 higher , suggesting that the uncertainties derived from the rosat data were underestimated .",
    "amazingly , the flux of this knot fits the overall slope of the sed ( based on table  [ tab - fluxes ] ) , 0.76 @xmath8 0.02 , to within the uncertainties , even after extrapolating over several orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "furthermore , the spectral slope in the x - ray band is similar to that of the sed .",
    "thus , the spectrum does not appear to break within the chandra bandpass , which is consistent with the excellent spectral fit to the chandra data .",
    "the luminosity of knot a1 , @xmath3 erg / s ( for @xmath24 = 0.5 and @xmath25 = 70 km / s / mpc ) , is about 40% of the total x - ray emission from jet , so if the spectrum of knot a1 extends out to 100 - 200 kev with @xmath26 = 0.6 , then its x - ray flux will dominate the total power of the jet .",
    "if the synchrotron break is above 5 kev then @xmath27 for the electrons , if one synchrotron model is to fit all the data .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath28 g , based on minimum energy arguments for nonrelativistic bulk motion . for a cylindrical emitting volume of the size defined by the optical emission ,",
    "the ssc emission from knot a1 would be less than 0.1 njy , well below the observed value .",
    "connecting the radio and optical / x - ray bands of the b1 sed requires a slight bend , consistent with the apparent flattening in the optical band . while the form of the electron energy distribution may not be a pure power law , no spectral cutoff",
    "is observed in the sed , so the electron energies may well reach energies comparable to those in knot a1 .",
    "rser et al .  determined that ssc models of knot b1 would not give rise to such large x - ray fluxes and we confirm this conclusion .",
    "as in knot a1 , @xmath29 is much higher in the x - ray band than in the optical and radio bands . because @xmath30 in the x - ray band , we do not yet know where the total powers of these knots peak .    without detecting spectral cutoffs",
    "as observed in the first knot of the jet in pks  0637752 @xcite , we can not tell if there is a problem with the synchrotron model for knots a1 and b1 as found in that source .",
    "similarly , the x - ray emission mechanism in the inner jet region is difficult to model without spectra from the radio and optical bands .",
    "although there is no specific evidence that relativistic motion is required to explain the x - ray fluxes of the inner jet or knots a1 and b1 , as in the model suggested by @xcite and @xcite , this beaming model is a promising explanation for the x - ray fluxes of the weaker knots so it could also provide a an alternative to the synchrotron models for knots a1 and b1 .",
    "thus , based on morphological similarities between the x - ray and optical images and considering that much of the jet power may be dissipated in the knots , we speculate that the knots are locations of internal shocks in a relativistic jet flow that is decelerating before equilibrating with the ambient medium . alternatively , a helical jet structure would have regularly spaced inflection points where the local jet flow is close to the line of sight ; beaming would be enhanced , giving rise to to the observed knots .",
    "we thank herman - josef rser for discussions about the hst data for which he was the principal investigator .",
    "we thank tom muxlow of jodrell bank for providing the merlin image .",
