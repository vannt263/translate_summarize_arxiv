    "single electron tunneling ( set ) is a salient feature of quantum transport in nanostructures .",
    "the set phenomenon is observed in various systems , e.g. quantum dots in a tunnel contact with metallic electrodes , @xcite molecular bridges between the edges of broken metallic wires , @xcite atoms and molecules absorbed on metallic surfaces in a contact with the tip of tunnel microscope , @xcite etc .",
    "the study of electron tunneling through the nano - object with time - dependent characteristics is one of the most challenging problems in this field .",
    "there are several sources of time dependence , which may be realized in practical devices .",
    "the simplest one is the time - dependent gate voltage @xmath0 applied to the dot .",
    "it is well known @xcite that this time dependence may be converted into the time dependence of tunnel matrix element .",
    "another possibility is the nanoelectromechanical shuttling ( nems),@xcite where the nano - size island suspended on a pivot@xcite or attached to a string@xcite oscillates between the leads under the action of an electro - mechanical force . in case of molecular bridges",
    ", the vibration eigen modes may be the source of the periodical oscillations of tunneling parameters.@xcite    usually the tunneling between metallic leads and such a nanoobject is accompanied by many - particle kondo screening effect @xcite resulting in specific type of zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) in tunnel conductance .",
    "modification of kondo regime because of periodically modulated in time tunneling rate due to the center - of - mass oscillations was studied recently in several papers . if the oscillations are the eigen modes of a nanoobject ( molecule ) , then the kondo - peak ( zero bias anomaly in tunnel conductance ) may transform into dip due to the destructive interference with vibrational mode .",
    "@xcite in case of adiabatic motion induced by electromechanical forces ( nems ) @xcite the kondo temperature follows the periodical evolution of the dot position and increases eventually due to effective reduction of the average distance between the dot and the leads , @xcite which is determined by the mean square displacement of the dot ( in analogy with debye - waller effect in scattering intensity ) .",
    "non - adiabatic enhancement of kondo tunneling through such moving nanoobject at finite source - drain bias has been studied recently.@xcite    in the present paper we consider adiabatic and non - adiabatic time - dependent effects in conventional cotunneling between metallic leads due to periodic modulation of lead - dot tunneling rate . to suppress many - particle kondo screening effects",
    ", one should consider leads with magnetically polarized electrons .",
    "the tunneling between the ferromagnetically ordered leads was discussed recently@xcite in the context of kondo effect .",
    "we are interested in the situation , where the spin - flip cotunneling is completely suppressed at small lead - dot bias and low temperatures .",
    "such tunneling regime may be realized in half - metallic ferromagnets , where the fermi surface is formed only by the majority spin electrons , whereas the spectrum of minority spin carries is gapped .",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties of such metallic compounds are reviewed in ref . .",
    "from the point of view of existing devices , where the leads are formed by two - dimensional electrons in degenerate semiconductors , the relevant material for our studies is dilute magnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)as.@xcite the indirect magnetic exchange between mn impurity ions is responsible for the long - range ferromagnetic order in this material . this exchange is mediated by spin - polarized carriers near the top of the valence band .",
    "the tunnel current in the half - metallic regime arises due to the minority spin hole cotunneling .",
    "we will show that in the absence of kondo effect the problem of tunneling through moving nano - island ( quantum dot ) may be solved by means of _ time - dependent canonical transformation _ ,",
    "which exactly takes into account both adiabatic and non - adiabatic lead - dot tunneling processes diagonal in the lead indices .",
    "the non - diagonal source - drain cotunneling may be treated by the canonical transformation method only perturbatively , but the adiabatic and non - adiabatic contributions into tunnel conductance may be sorted out also in this case .",
    "it will be shown that the time - dependent contribution into current - voltage characteristics of moving nano - object is significant near the boundaries of coulomb diamonds .",
    "we choose for the realization of ac - driven tunnel conductivity the simplest model of a nanoobject , which is widely used in the studies of single - electron tunneling ( set ) .",

    "the set regime arises due to the coulomb blockade effect : addition energy for the second electron in a singly occupied dot is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the tunneling rate to the left ( @xmath4 ) and right ( @xmath5)lead , and @xmath6 is the capacitive energy of the dot . to separate the time - dependent set from the kondo zba",
    ", we consider tunneling between spin - polarized leads , where spin - flip processes are inelastic , because the continuum of electron - hole pairs with the opposite spins in the leads responsible for the kondo effect is gapped .",

    "it is shown that in the situation where the spin - flip cotunneling processes are suppressed at low energies , the exact canonical transformation eliminating the tunneling term in the anderson hamiltonian exists even in the presence of strong hubbard repulsion in the shuttle and time - dependent lead - shuttle tunneling .",
    "this canonical transformation in principle allows one to sort out the slow adiabatic renormalization of the energy levels and the tunnel transparency and to consider non - adiabatic corrections at least perturbatively .",
    "one may also include the inelastic spin - flip processes in the canonical transformation in the 4-th order of perturbation theory in @xmath243 , but these weak corrections do not change the above qualitative picture .",
    "we also have calculated the weak non - adiabatic corrections to tunneling transparency in a specific model of periodic sinusoidal motion of the shuttle .",
    "undoubtedly , strong non - adiabatic effects should be taken into account in a more refined scheme : in the case of a periodic time - dependent perturbation one should appeal to the floquet theorem in the time domain and use the quasi energy language.@xcite    because of the energy gap for spin - flip processes in the half - metallic leads the kondo cotunneling processes are suppressed , and the zero - bias anomaly in the tunnel conductance is absent .",
    "physical manifestations of the shuttling mechanism under discussion arise in the form of time - dependent enhancement of conductance at finite bias near the boundaries of coulomb diamonds on the phase diagram @xmath134 .",
    "the boundaries themselves are distorted due to the complete spin polarization of carriers ( see fig . [ f.diamond ] ) , and even the coulomb blockade step corresponding to occupation change from odd to even number of electrons in the dot is absent at zero bias .",
    "one may expect appearance of quasi energy satellites in this part of the phase diagram @xmath134 when the shuttle motion is essentially non - adiabatic .",
    "this regime is a subject for future studies .",
