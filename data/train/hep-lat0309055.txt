    "recent improvements in lattice determinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite encourage us to hope that lattice values for semileptonic form factors for heavy - light decays will achieve an accuracy of a few percent in the near future .",
    "previous form factor calculations have been done in the quenched approximation ( except for a preliminary study @xcite ) , using light quarks with masses of the order of the strange quark @xcite . here",
    "we report a preliminary investigation of quenching effects by comparing results from matched quenched and dynamical quark - loop gauge ensembles @xcite .",
    "the 409 @xmath3 quenched lattices were generated with a one - loop symanzik - improved gauge action , and the 489 @xmath3 dynamical lattices were generated with 2 + 1 flavors of asqtad staggered quarks with bare quark masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the latter , approximately 1.2 times the physical strange quark mass .",
    "the lattice scale @xmath6 was based on the @xmath7 1s-1p mass splitting @xcite , giving @xmath8 fm for the quenched lattices and @xmath9 fm for the dynamical lattices .",
    "form factors were measured using clover - improved , propagating wilson light and heavy quarks .",
    "three light and five heavy quark masses were used for each ensemble .",
    "the mass of the lightest quark was approximately equal to the strange quark mass , thus avoiding problems with exceptional configurations .",
    "quark masses were tuned only approximately between the two ensembles , so a comparison of results requires some interpolation .",
    "we included three heavy - light `` @xmath10 '' meson three - momenta and 21 three - momentum transfers to the recoiling light - light `` @xmath11 '' meson .",
    "we measure the three point function in the usual way with a light - light ( or heavy - light ) `` @xmath11 '' interpolating operator @xmath12 at @xmath13 , a heavy - light `` @xmath10 '' interpolating operator @xmath14 at @xmath15 and a weak vector current operator acting over the range @xmath16 $ ] : @xmath17 the quark - antiquark wavefunction @xmath18 for the @xmath11 meson was a product of two independent gaussians of width @xmath19 centered at the origin .",
    "the quark - antiquark wavefunction @xmath20 for the @xmath10 meson was a plane wave of c.m .",
    "momentum @xmath21 and a decaying exponential in the relative coordinate .",
    "the current vertex was projected onto three - momentum @xmath22 , thus selecting a recoil three - momentum @xmath23 .",
    "heavy - light and light - light two - point functions were also measured over the same range of three - momenta @xmath24 and with source / sink combinations @xmath18 and @xmath20 : @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the form factor was extracted using the conventional ratio method @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are hadron overlap coefficients , @xmath31 is the plateau value of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the fermilab normalization @xcite .",
    "additional vertex operators were measured to implement the tadpole improved rotation for the quark wave functions in the vector current : @xmath34q(x).\\ ] ] for each quark mass combination the two - point functions were fit simultaneously for all momenta to a ground plus first excited state expression parameterized by a smooth function of momentum .",
    "the resulting ground state energies were then fixed when fitting the three - point functions , and the resulting hadronic overlap coefficients were used to complete the three - point function .",
    "the lorentz invariant form factors @xmath35 and @xmath36 were extracted using kinematic factors based on physical hadron masses determined from the two - point dispersion relations . to compare quenched and dynamical results , we required an interpolation in only the heavy quark mass , since a light quark mass in each ensemble was already matched to the strange quark mass , as determined from the unmixed @xmath37 pseudoscalar meson . to this",
    "end the form factors were fit to a parameterization of beirevi and kaidalov ( bk ) @xcite : @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , which incorporates constraints from heavy quark scaling , the @xmath40 meson pole , and qcd sum rules .",
    "the resulting bk coefficients were then interpolated to the various dynamical - ensemble physical heavy - light meson masses through a fit to scaling forms as a function of the heavy - light meson mass , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bkscaling ] .",
    "a sample result is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : b_to_pi_ff2_zk0_sq2_bkfit ] .",
    "the quenched prediction is about 10% low . at this heavy - light mass",
    "the effect is greater than @xmath41 .",
    "we find a similar underestimate for the entire range of heavy - light meson masses in this study , from approximately @xmath42 to @xmath43 with light spectator and recoil quarks at the strange quark mass .",
    "we have measured the semileptonic form factor for decays of a heavy - light pseudoscalar meson to a light - light pseudoscalar meson using improved wilson valence quarks .",
    "we chose carefully matched quenched and asqtad @xmath44 flavor staggered fermion ensembles to look for the effects of virtual quarks . fixing all light quarks at the strange quark mass",
    ", we required only a single heavy - quark interpolation to make the comparison . for heavy - light masses of the order of the @xmath45 mass",
    ", we found that virtual quark loops tend to increase the form factors by approximately 10% , a @xmath46 effect .",
    "note however that our preliminary analysis neglects lattice / continuum matching ( lattice renormalization ) of the heavy - light current . since the coupling constant is larger on the dynamical lattices , including the renormalization may compensate for at least some of the difference found between quenched and dynamical simulations .",
