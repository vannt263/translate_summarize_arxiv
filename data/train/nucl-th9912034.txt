    "the pion nucleon sigma term ( @xmath4 ) continues to be a puzzle some thirty years after initial attempts to determine it .",
    "the keen interest in @xmath4 comes from the fact that it vanishes in the massless quark ( chiral ) limit of qcd , and becomes non - zero only for a non - zero light ( up or down ) quark mass , so it is a crucial parameter in the understanding of chiral symmetry breaking ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the nucleon s strange quark content can be inferred from @xmath4 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so @xmath4 is also relevant to _ quark confinement _ , not yet fully understood , since one must understand the mechanism for accommodating strange quarks in an ostensibly light quark object  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath4 is a parameter of _ fundamental _ significance to low energy qcd , making it crucial to obtain its value as precisely as possible .",
    "the canonical result for @xmath5 mev  @xcite implies a large nucleon strangeness content  @xcite , and much effort has been spent trying to understand that .",
    "this article outlines recent work of the ( former ) virginia polytechnic institute ( vpi ) , ( now george washington university ( gwu ) ) group to extract the `` experimental '' value of the sigma term ( @xmath4 ) from the @xmath0n scattering data as part of ongoing @xmath0n partial - wave ( pwa ) and dispersion relation ( dr ) analyses .",
    "the `` experimental '' sigma term @xmath4 is related to the @xmath0n isoscalar amplitude @xmath6 ( bar signifies the pseudovector born term is subtracted ) at the `` cheng - dashen point ''  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8=92.4 mev is the pion decay constant , @xmath9 is the crossing energy variable , and @xmath10 is the four - momentum transfer . since the cheng - dashen point lies outside the physical @xmath0n scattering region , the experimental @xmath0n amplitudes must be _ extrapolated _ in order to obtain @xmath4 .",
    "the most theoretically well - founded extrapolation approach is based on dispersion relation ( dr ) analyses of the scattering amplitudes  @xcite . in the early 80@xmath11 ,",
    "the karlsruhe - helsinki group performed extensive investigations into obtaining @xmath4 from @xmath0n dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "the canonical result @xmath12 mev was based on hyperbolic dispersion relation  @xcite calculations using the groups @xmath0n  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite phase shifts .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     our solution `` sm99 '' satisfies fixed - t and forward dispersion relations well ( up to our @xmath14800 mev constraint limit ) , and the data ( up to 2 gev ) are fit with @xmath15/data point = ( 2 , 2 , 2.5 ) for ( @xmath16,@xmath17,cex ) . compared to the karlsruhe ka84 solution  @xcite , these same dispersion relations are better satisfied ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : c+const ] ,  [ fig : e+const ] ,  [ fig : c+fixed - tconst ] ) , and the data much better fit ( @xmath15/point = ( 4 , 5 , 3.5 ) for ka84 ) .",
    "the pwa and dr solutions clearly favour a @xmath0nn coupling constant @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , determination in these proceedings for details  @xcite . ]",
    "consistent with our recently published solutions  @xcite .",
    "this value is compatible with most recent determinations  @xcite and @xmath145% below the canonical value 0.079 used in the kh80 and ka84 solutions    for the subthreshold coefficients from the glls method , we obtain @xmath20= -1.27@xmath20.03 and @xmath21= 1.27@xmath20.03 @xmath22 , where the uncertainty is from the energy fluctuations only ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : c+const ] and  [ fig : e+const ] ) .",
    "this implies @xmath2378 mev ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : linearsigma ] ) , which is @xmath1455% larger than the canonical result @xmath2450 mev  @xcite . as a check of our dispersion relation machinery , we inputed the karlsruhe ka84  @xcite phases and reproduced their @xmath25 and @xmath26 results exactly .",
    "table  [ tab : sigma_terms ] shows a term by term comparison between sm99 and ka84 to analyze the differences .",
    "though the difference between the sm99 and ka84 @xmath27 values is surprisingly large , one _ expects _ about 21 mev of the difference from new information on pionic atoms , a lower coupling constant , and a narrower @xmath3 resonance width .",
    "the isoscalar scattering length @xmath28 for ka84 ( and kh80 ) , but analyses of recent psi pionic hydrogen and deuterium results yields @xmath29  @xcite or @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "our analysis used the latter , while the `` expectation '' in table  [ tab : sigma_terms ] assumes @xmath31 . a lower coupling constant around @xmath32",
    "is favoured by most analyses  @xcite and this `` expectation '' contributes + 7 mev in table  [ tab : sigma_terms ] from the @xmath33 born term .",
    "the @xmath34 born term does not change due to a well know insensitivity to @xmath35 . and",
    "it is well known that the @xmath3 resonance width is too wide in ka84 ( overshoots the total cross sections on the left wing ) , so since @xmath36 is proportional to the sum of the @xmath37p and @xmath17p total cross sections via the optical theorem , one expects the @xmath38 integral contribution to decrease . due to @xmath3 region dominance of the @xmath39 dr ,",
    "the @xmath3 width and @xmath35 are correlated , and a @xmath40% decrease in @xmath35 _ roughly _ corresponds to a same decrease in the integrals , and this expectation is reflected in table  [ tab : sigma_terms ] .",
    "a narrower @xmath3 also would reduce the @xmath33 dr integral , but possible changes in higher partial waves make predictions less clear .",
    "so from rather general considerations , one _ expects _ a significant increase from the canonical value for @xmath27 based on new experimental information .",
    "the result from the tangent of the @xmath41 subtraction constants at @xmath10=0 yields @xmath42= -1.15@xmath20.03 and @xmath43=1.23@xmath20.03 , where the uncertainties reflect only the energy fluctuations of the constants ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : c+fixed - tconst ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath27=80 mev , consistent with our other determination .",
    "figure  [ fig : c+extrap ] shows this result along with the tangent inferred from the forward @xmath34 and @xmath33 dr analysis .",
    "the consistency is not perfect , and the slight differences in the @xmath44 , which are believed to be understood , are being studied further .    in summary , we have performed a new @xmath0n partial wave and dispersion relation analysis , from which we obtain @xmath4 = 91@xmath28 mev using two different methods , about 27 mev larger than the canonical result 64@xmath28 mev from ref .",
    "@xcite . at first glance",
    "the result is indeed surprising , but a large upward change is in fact _ expected _ based on new information on @xmath45 from pionic hydrogen and deuterium  @xcite , a lower @xmath0nn coupling constant @xmath46  @xcite , and a narrower @xmath3 resonance width .",
    "further study is planned to explore systematic uncertainties and to resolve small inconsistencies .",
    "a new analysis based on the the karlsruhe methods  @xcite applied to the modern data is urged to check these findings .",
