    "in this note , we study graphs without cycles of prescribed even lengths . for a finite or infinite set @xmath4 of cycles , define @xmath5 to be the maximum possible number of edges in an @xmath0-vertex graph which does not contain any of the cycles in @xmath4 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the function @xmath5 is particularly interesting when at least one of the cycles in @xmath4 is of even length , and was initiated by erds @xcite . in general , it is the lower bounds for @xmath5  that is , the construction of dense graphs without certain even cycles  which are hard to come by .",
    "the best known lower bounds are based on finite geometries , such as polarity graphs of generalized polygons  @xcite , and the algebraic constructions given by lazebnik , ustimenko and woldar  @xcite and ramanujan graphs of lubotsky , phillips and sarnak  @xcite ; see also  @xcite . in the direction of upper bounds ,",

    "then , for all @xmath0 , @xmath8 furthermore , when @xmath3 , the @xmath0-vertex polarity graphs of generalized @xmath9-gons in @xcite have @xmath2 edges and no even cycles of length at most @xmath1",

    "theorem [ thm : main ] extends the moore bound ( see @xcite ) up to an additive term , and a more recent result of alon , hoory , and linial  @xcite , who proved that an @xmath0-vertex graph without cycles of length at most @xmath1 has at most @xmath10 edges ( see proposition [ prop : ahl ] ) . in other words",
    ", we do not require that the odd cycles be forbidden , and the same bound still holds , but with a weaker additive linear term .",
    "our result is also best possible in the following sense : if we forbid only the @xmath1-cycle in our graphs , then the upper bounds in theorem [ thm : main ] no longer hold  it was shown recently , in @xcite , that @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xmath0 tends to infinity .",

    "since each cycle @xmath63 is of length at most @xmath1 , each cycle in the vine has odd length .",
