    "it is well known that there exist extremely high energy ( ehe ) particles in the universe with energies up to @xmath8 ev  @xcite . these ehe cosmic rays ( ehecrs ) may be originated in and/or producing neutrinos by the various mechanism .",
    "for example collisions of ehecrs and cmb photons photoproduce cosmogenic neutrinos  @xcite , a consequence from the process known as the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) mechanism  @xcite",
    ". possible production of ehecrs in the present universe due to the annihilation or collapse of topological defects ( tds ) such as monopoles and/or cosmic strings  @xcite could also generate ehe neutrinos with energies even reaching to the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "ehe neutrinos provide , therefore , an unique probe to explore ultra - high energy universe , which is one of the center piece of high energy neutrino astrophysics .",
    "it has been argued that underground neutrino telescopes being operated and/or planned to be built are capable of detecting such ehe neutrinos  @xcite . in their travel in the earth to the detection volume in a telescope , ehe neutrinos collide with nuclei in the rock due to enhancement of the cross section at ehe range and produce secondary leptons like muons and taus .",
    "the expected mean free path is @xmath9 km which is by far shorter than a typical path length of the propagation in the earth .",
    "moreover , the decay lifetime is long enough at ehes for the produced @xmath10 and @xmath11 to survive and possibly reach the detection volume directly .",
    "successive reactions of the interactions and decaying are likely to occur in their propagation and the propagation processes of ehe particles are rather complex .",
    "the accurate understanding of the ehe neutrino and charged lepton propagation in the earth is , thus , inevitable for ehe neutrino search by underground neutrino telescopes .",
    "there have been considerable discussions in the literature from this point of view . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the transport equations mainly focusing on @xmath6 and @xmath11 were solved and the resultant particle fluxes after the propagation have been shown for trajectories of several nadir angles in the horizontal directions such as @xmath12 .",
    "it is true that a major faction of ehe @xmath11 tracks are coming from the horizontal directions because the earth is opaque for ehe neutrinos , but a km@xmath0 scale neutrino observatory like icecube is essentially a 4@xmath13 detector with comparable sensitivities to both muons and taus , and calculation of ehe particle energy spectra of both muons and taus over all solid angle space including downward event trajectories would be important to evaluate detectability with reasonable accuracy .",
    "furthermore , they utilized the often - used continuous energy loss ( cel ) approximation that follows only the leading cascade particles .",
    "it is a good approximation for taus , but the secondary particle fluxes contributed from the non - leading particles are not negligible for muons at ehes where their decay does not play a visible role .",
    "calculations on the earth - skimming ehe @xmath6 have also been made in some details  @xcite .",
    "they used approximations to neglect contributions of generated leptons from tau interactions / decay in the earth , which would be valid enough for consideration of earth - skimming neutrino - induced air showers .",
    "it has been pointed out , however , that the secondary produced @xmath14 and @xmath4 by tau decays would also enhance the total neutrino flux  @xcite , which would be a benefit for an underground neutrino observatory . following all propagating leptons and taking into account the contributions from particles not only skimming but propagating deeper in the earth are , therefore , essential to an underground - based neutrino observatory .    in this work ,",
    "we numerically calculate the intensity and the energy distribution of ehe neutrinos and their secondary produced @xmath10 s and @xmath11 s during the propagation in the earth for the application to a km@xmath0 scale neutrino observatory .",
    "the resultant fluxes are shown as a function of nadir angles from downward to upward going directions .",
    "all the relevant interactions are taken into account and we follow _ all _ produced particles in the reactions whereas the cel approximation follows only the leading cascade particles .",
    "the initial flux is mainly assumed to be a bulk of the cosmogenic neutrinos , generated from the decay of pions photoproduced by ehe cosmic ray protons colliding with the cosmic thermal background photons , since the cosmogenic neutrino model is appropriate for a benchmark as the flux prediction is on the solid theoretical foundation .",
    "its implications to the detection by the icecube neutrino telescope  @xcite , which are currently under construction at antarctica , are then discussed in some details .",

    "the method of our numerical calculations is also briefly explained . in the sec .",

    "ehe neutrinos during the propagation do not penetrate the earth but are involved in charged / neutral current interactions that generate charged leptons and hadronic showers because their cross sections are expected to be enhanced in the ultra - high energy regime .",
    "secondary produced @xmath10 s and @xmath11 s travel in the earth initiating many radiative reactions to lose their energy .",
    "the higher - order interactions like @xmath15 pair production  @xcite and the charged current disappearance reactions like @xmath16 would regenerate charged leptons and neutrinos which are subject to further interactions . moreover",

    "we artificially switch off the photonuclear interaction to see its systematic uncertainty in the results later in this paper .",
    "furthermore , the week interaction , @xmath19 , to cause muon and tau disappearances , and the heavier lepton pair production such as @xmath20  @xcite are also taken into account in the present calculation , which leads to a visible contribution to the particle fluxes at ehes .",
    "an ehe neutrino is a subject to charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) interactions with nucleon . as there is no direct measurement of the relevant interactions in ehe range , the predictions of the @xmath21 cross sections rely on incompletely tested assumptions about the behavior of parton distributions at very small values of the momentum fraction @xmath22 . since we do not have further clues to investigate ehe neutrino interactions in our hands , we limit our present analysis within the range of the standard particle physics and use the cross section estimated by ref",

    "the @xmath4 sensitivity is better than that of @xmath6 below @xmath26 gev region because muon energy loss in a detection volume is larger than that of taus with same energy , but the tau decay which results in large energy deposit in a detection volume make dominant contributions in the @xmath6 sensitivity in this relatively low energy range forming a slight bump structure in the sensitivity curve .",

    "there is little gain in ehe neutrino searches , however , because the proposed ehe neutrino models have its main energy range above @xmath26 gev .",

    "the mass composition of cosmic rays in the relevant energy range would also be a deciding factor of the prompt muon flux intensity : it can be reduced by an order of magnitude if the cosmic rays are heavy nuclei  @xcite and may not constitute a background in the ehe neutrino search . even if the prompt muon intensity is sizable , their energy spectrum would still be much steeper than the expected spectrum in the proposed ehe cosmic neutrino models , however , and one can easily distinguish the signal detections from the prompt muon background events if the neutrino observatory has reasonable resolution for the energy loss of muons and taus tracks .",
