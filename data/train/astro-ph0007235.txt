    "the frequency of binary and multiple systems amongst stars of different masses is a fundamental parameter in both star formation theory , and understanding mechanisms for the formation of planetary systems .",
    "low - mass stars have received less attention than solar - type g dwarfs , but the available observations suggest that the multiplicity fraction decreases from @xmath11 or more at m@xmath12 ( duquennoy & mayor , 1991 ) to @xmath13 for m dwarfs ( fisher & marcy , 1991 ; reid & gizis , 1997a ) .",
    "most previous surveys have concentrated on field stars , which span a range of age and abundance .",
    "open clusters offer an alternative laboratory , where age and abundance are both homogeneous and , within the limits of theoretical models , known factors .",
    "cluster analyses , however , must allow for the possibility that dynamical evolution may have modified key characteristics since formation .",
    "binaries , for example , are likely to be retained preferentially , inflating the apparent binary frequency at a given spectral type .",
    "the hyades is the nearest substantial open cluster , and its members have received considerable observational and theoretial attention .",
    "higher - mass cluster members ( spectral types earlier than mid - k ) have been the subject of both radial velocity observations ( griffin et al , 1988 ) and high - resolution infrared speckle interferometry ( patience et al , 1998 ) , as well as extensive proper - motion surveys capable of detecting wide companions ( hanson , 1975 ; reid , 1992 and refs within ) .",
    "the deduced binary frequency is broadly consistent with duquennoy & mayor s analysis of similar - mass stars in the solar neighbourhood . at lower masses , over fifty of the cluster m dwarfs",
    "were targeted for observation by the hubble space telescope ( gizis & reid , 1997 ; reid & gizis , 1997b ) , with the planetary camera images providing a spatial resolution comparable to the ground - base speckle data , @xmath14 arcsec .",
    "again , the frequency of companions is consistent with that amongst nearby field dwarfs , although only six binaries are available for this statistical comparison .",
    "few accurate radial velocity measurements exist for late - type hyades dwarfs .",
    "griffin et al include a few late - k , early - m dwarfs in their survey , and cochran & hatzes ( 1999 ) include early - type m dwarfs in their planet search .",
    "stauffer et al ( 1997 ) surveyed 49 early - type m dwarfs , including three non - members , identifying seven double - lined spectroscopic binaries and one triple system .",
    "the faintest star in their sample , va 127 ( rhy 143 ) has spectral type m4 , and an absolute magnitude m@xmath15 .",
    "data for later type stars are scarce .",
    "jones et al ( 1996 ) include three of the lowest luminosity cluster members ( br 804=rhy 386 , br 816 and br 262=lp415 - 20 , from bryja et al , 1993 ) in their high - resolution spectroscopy of low - mass hyads and pleiads .",
    "most recently , terndrup et al ( 2000 ) have observed 18 hyades dwarfs with m@xmath16 , including ten in common with the current sample .",
    "given the paucity of observations , it is not surprising that few spectroscopic binaries have been identified amongst the cluster m dwarfs .",
    "extending observations to cover this smaller range of physical separations provides a further comparison of the binary frequency relative to that amongst field dwarfs .",
    "in addition , high resolution spectroscopic data provide a means of probing the physical structure of these stars , notably the range of chromospheric activity and the distributon of rotatioal velocities .",
    "the current scarcity of observations reflects the faint apparent magnitudes of these stars , and the consequent difficulties of obtaining high signal - to - noise data at the appropriate spectral resolution .",
    "those circumstances have changed with the availability of 8 - 10 metre class telescopes equipped with high efficiency echelle spectrographs .",
    "this paper presents the first results from a survey of late - type hyades m dwarfs , based on observations with the hires spectrograph on the keck i telescope .",
    "most of the targets also have high spatial - resolution hst images .",
    "the following section outlines the observations ; section 3 describes the measurement of radial and rotational velocities ; section 4 presents the techniques used to identify possible binaries ; section 5 discusses the binaries identified from our observations ; section 6 compares rotation and activity in these low mass stars ; and section 7 presents our conclusions .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      table 8 lists the rotational velocities derived for the hyades dwarfs in our sample .",
    "all are chromospherically active , with substantial h@xmath10 emission .",
    "as indicated by the individual measurements listed in table 5 , the level of activity can vary by up to 30% on relatively short timescales .",
    "this intrinsic variability is the dominant source of uncertainty in determining stellar activity from one or two observations , as is the case here .",
    "figure 7 illustrates this effect , comparing successive observations of rhy 403 from dec 29 , 1999 .",
    "note the central reversal in the stronger h@xmath10 line profile .",
    "as stauffer et al point out , the majority of slow rotators ( @xmath17 kms@xmath1 ) have similar profiles , while stars with faster rotation have either flat - topped or peaked h@xmath10 lines .",
    "we are interested in determing the extend of any correlation between the level of chromospheric activity and the underlying stellar rotation .",
    "the standard paradigm ( stauffer et al , 1997 ) envisions a direct correlation , with activity increasing with increasing rotation until a `` saturation '' velocity is achieved , where the chromosphere and coronal loops are fully active .",
    "recent observational results , however , have raised serious questions as to whether this scenario is maintained in low - mass , late - type m dwarfs ( hawley et al , 1999 ) .",
    "the standard rotation / activity hypothesis rests on an extension of the observed behaviour of g and k dwarfs , where there is a clear activity - rotation correlation .",
    "both parameters are believed to be age dependent , with the star spinning down as it loses angular momentum due to coupling of the star s magnetic field with the local medium ( skumanich , 1972 ) . since activity in these stars",
    "is powered by a shell dynamo ( parker , 1955 ) , located at the boundary between the radiative core and the outer convective layers , the activity - rotation correlation is expected .",
    "this mechanism , however , can not be present in fully convective low - mass stars .",
    "indeed , early studies predicted a break in the level of activity at a mass of @xmath18 , where the radiative core disappears .",
    "the continued presence of high levels of activity in these stars is probably due to the presence of a turbulent ( shear ) dynamo mechanism ( durney et al , 1993 ) . in that case",
    ", there is no expectation of a direct correlation with rotational velocity .    investigating this question",
    "requires a reliable measurement of the level of activity in stars with temperatures between 4000 and 2400k .",
    "the equivalent width of the h@xmath10 emission line is frequently used for this purpose .",
    "this parameter , however , provides a misleading measure of activity , since the equivalent width produced by a given line flux depends on the level of the underlying continuum .",
    "this is a particularly important consideration for m dwarfs , since the r@xmath19-band flux decreases rapidly with decreasing temperature from spectral type m0 ( @xmath20k ) through m5 ( @xmath21k ) to m9 ( @xmath22k ) .",
    "this complication can be avoided by calculating the parameter @xmath23 , the fraction of the total luminosity emitted in h@xmath10 .",
    "this provides a measure of stellar activity _ independent _ of both temperature and luminosity .",
    "we have computed bolometric magnitudes for the stars in our sample using the ( v - i ) colours and the relation @xmath24 derived from leggett et al s ( 1996 ) data for field m dwarfs . table 7 lists those magnitudes , together with data for hyades stars from stauffer et al ( 1997 ) , jones et al ( 1996 ) and terndrup et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "deriving l@xmath25 for these stars requires an estimate of the continuum flux at 6563 , f@xmath19 .",
    "reid et al ( 1995b ) demonstrated that f@xmath19 can be derived from the r@xmath19-band flux , f@xmath26 , from the relation @xmath27 all of the stars in table 1 have r - band photometry ( reid , 1993 and references therein ) . for stars with multiple observations ,",
    "the h@xmath10 fluxes are derived using the average equivalent width ( with the exception of the mjd 794.46 observation of rhy 281 , discussed further below ) .",
    "variability , as noted above , leads to typical uncertainties of @xmath28 .",
    "the uppermost panel in figure 8 shows the ( m@xmath29 , log(l@xmath25/l@xmath29 ) ) distribution for hyades m dwarfs .",
    "contrary to the suggestion by terndrup et",
    "al ( 2000 ) , there is no evidence for a decline in activity with decreasing luminosity .",
    "known binaries and single stars are distinguished using different symbols on the diagram , but there is no evidence that the former are more ( or less ) active than the latter .",
    "these data confirm results derived previously by reid et al ( 1995b ) , a paper which unaccountably seems to have escaped terndrup et al s attention .",
    "figure 8b plots the ( @xmath9 , m@xmath29 ) distribution for the hyades stars , illustrating the well known tendency towards higher rotation with decreasing mass .",
    "however , figure 8c shows that there is no correlation between the level of chromospheric activity and rotation : a hyades m dwarf with @xmath30 can have a measured rotational velocity anywhere between @xmath31 and 40 kms@xmath1 , the full range measured for cluster stars .",
    "this result is in good agreement with data for late - type field m dwarfs ( hawley et al , 1999 ) , but directly contradicts terndrup et al s analysis of a subset of the present sample .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy rests with terndrup et al s use of equivalent width as an estimator of stellar activity . as noted above ( and , indeed , by terndrup et al ) , the equivalent width of an emission line depends on both the total line flux and the level of the local continuum .",
    "thus , early - type hyades m dwarfs have weaker emission than late - type dwarfs , even though the chromosphere is at the same _ proportional _ level of activity .",
    "further , figure 8b shows that late - type dwarfs ( with higher h@xmath10 ew ) tend to have more rapid rotation .",
    "thus , the correlation between `` activity '' and rotation claimed by terndrup et al is actually the ( mass / m@xmath29 , @xmath9 ) correlation illustrated in figure 8b .",
    "terndrup et al also present rotation and activity measurements for low - mass pleiades stars .",
    "figure 9 plots their data , together with observations from jones et al ( 1996 ) and basri & marcy ( 1995 ) , using @xmath32 rather than h@xmath10 ew . in these diagram does not change the overall morphology ] with an age of @xmath33 myrs , the pleiades stars are more luminous ( and hotter ) at a given mass , and significantly more active .",
    "thus , the mass range is @xmath34 , similar to the hyades stars . while the measured rotational velocities approach 100 kms@xmath1",
    ", there is no evidence for any correlation between rotation and the level of chromospheric activity .",
    "these results are consistent with hawley et al s ( 1999 ) proposal that the mechanism driving chromospheric activity changes as one moves from early - type m dwarfs to mid- and late - type dwarfs . as convection becomes increasingly important and the radiative core shrinks , the shell dynamo weakens .",
    "in contrast , the turbulent dynamo increases in strength , supplanting the shell dynamo entirely in fully convective stars . as a result , rotation is irrelevant to the level of activity present in dwarfs of spectral type m3 and later .",
    "one observation in table 5 stands out : on december 12 , 1997 , the measured equivalent width of h@xmath10 emission in rhy 281 is @xmath35 .",
    "as figure 10 shows , we happened to catch the star during a flare outburst .",
    "in addition to h@xmath10 emission , he i 6678  is present with an equivalent width of 1.15 core emission is detectable in the k i 7665/7699 doublet , and we measure equivalent widths of 0.85 and 0.35   for the 8500 and 8663   components of the ca ii near - infrared triplet .",
    "since our observations concentrated almost exclusively on stars within a narrow range of absolute magnitude , @xmath36 , we can derive an approximate estimate of the frequency of flare outbursts in these stars . in total",
    ", we expended @xmath37 seconds integrating on m dwarfs in the course of this project ; the rhy 281 flare was detected in an 1800 second exposure , and we assume that the flare persisted at a detectable level for the duration of the exposure .",
    "given that assumption , we deduce that low - mass hyades dwarfs are in outburst for @xmath8 of the time .",
    "this compares with an upper limit of @xmath38 for the duty cycle estimated for the m9 field dwarf , bri0021 ( reid et al , 1999 ) .",
    "we have obtained high resolution spectroscopy of 51 low - mass dwarfs in the hyades cluster .",
    "at least three are confirmed as spectroscopic binaries : two double - lined systems , rhy 42 and 244 , the latter previously identified as a binary in hst imaging ; and rhy 403 , a short - period single - lined system with an extremely low - mass secondary .",
    "based on the mass function for the last star and the absence of any detection of the secondary at 8000 , we infer mass limits of @xmath39 , making this unseen companion a strong brown dwarf candidate .",
    "four other stars are possible binaries : rhy 158 shows strong indications of velocity variability ; rhy 281 lies @xmath40 kms@xmath1 from the expected velocity of hyades members ; rhy 221 and 377 are also offset in velocity , although to smaller extent .",
    "three further stars have unusual cross - correlation functions , although it is not clear whether these stem from binarity or rapid rotation . combining the new discoveries with pevious hst and ground - based identifications , we derive a binary fraction for hyades m dwarfs of 23 to 30 % , similar to results derived from nearby field m dwarfs .",
    "we have also used our data to determine rotational velocities and explore possible correlations between chromospheric activity and rotation . combined with literature data",
    ", we find that the level of chromospheric activity , as measured by the fractional luminosity emitted in the h@xmath10 line , @xmath23 , is nearly constant for m dwarfs with @xmath41 .",
    "there is no evidence for a significant correlation between activity and rotation as measured by @xmath9 .",
    "we interpret this as confirmation that the rotational dynamo is not present in fully convectice mid- and late - type m dwarfs .",
    "activity is probably driven by a shear dynamo mechanism , as proposed by hawley et al ( 1999 ) .",
