    "the study of magnetic colloids is of great importance both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view .",
    "recently there has been an increased interest in the study of the structural and the dynamical properties of magnetic confined ( in particular on the meso- and nano - scale ) systems due to the possibility of biomedical @xcite and engineering applications @xcite .",
    "examples of these magnetic systems are ferrofluid nanofilms @xcite and magnetorheological ( mr ) fluids @xcite . for instance , the translational dynamics of a mesoscopic 3d system of permanent magnetic dipoles was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was found that the system displays signatures of subdiffusive motion due to the strong suppression of orientational fluctuations of the magnetic dipoles by the presence of an homogenous external magnetic field .",
    "the formation of chains of magnetic dipoles ( coagulation effect @xcite ) is also relevant for the dynamical properties of these magnetic systems and may lead to different regimes of diffusion .",
    "magnetic clusters of dipolar particles were recently investigated experimentally @xcite and they may serve , e.g. , as drug delivery mechanisms in biological applications .",
    "the structural properties of magnetic colloids were recently analyzed experimentally @xcite and by means of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , where novel field - induced structural transitions were observed in confined ferrofluid nanofilms .    in comparison with infinite 3d or 2d systems , confined systems exhibit a particular behavior due to the competition between the confining potential and the interparticle interaction potential .",
    "for instance , for a 2d system of repulsive particles confined in a circular parabolic potential , previous studies clearly identified the effect of the boundaries on the structural and dynamical properties of the system , as well as on the melting @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility of confined systems is realised when the 2d system is subjected to an external confining potential ( e.g. parabolic ) in one direction .",
    "the system is called quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) .",
    "such a q1d system of repulsive interacting particles self - organize in a chain - like structure that was recently studied experimentally @xcite , and through analytical and numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "diffusion is strongly modified in confined systems , and may lead to single - file diffusion ( sfd ) @xcite , which is directly related to the geometrical constrains imposed by an external confining potential .",
    "furthermore , q1d systems can be used as models for the study of collective phenomena in low dimensional systems , e.g , vortex matter in type - ii superconductors @xcite , colloidal particles @xcite and dusty plasmas .",
    "in addition , the mechanisms of ion transport in narrow channels @xcite and dna manipulation using magnetic particles @xcite can be studied by modelling q1d systems .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate numerically the properties of a system of ferromagnetic dipolar particles confined in a one - dimensional parabolic trap ( which models a q1d channel ) coupled to a thermal bath .",
    "the orientation and strength of an in - plane external magnetic field @xmath0 are now control parameters that are able to influence the dynamics of the particles . for diluted systems ,",
    "particles are arranged in a single chain structure in the center of the parabolic channel .",
    "when @xmath0 is perpendicular to the channel , the magnetic particles interact through a pure repulsive potential . for any other orientation of @xmath0 ,",
    "an extra attractive term is present in the particle - particle interaction potential .",
    "the latter can be dominantly attractive or repulsive , depending on the orientation of the external magnetic field . in our numerical analysis",
    ", we perform extensive brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations and calculate the mean - square displacement ( msd ) @xmath1 of the particles for different parameters which characterizes the system . for the case of normal diffusion regime ( einstein or fickian diffusion ) , one has @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the `` free particle '' diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 is the so - called exponent of diffusion ( in this case , @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 is time . for values of @xmath7 ,",
    "diffusion is said to be anomalous .",
    "for instance , in the case of sfd , @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) where @xmath10 is the single - file diffusion mobility factor . we show that the application of an in - plane homogeneous external magnetic field leads to different regimes of diffusion depending on the orientation and strength of the field .",
    "we emphasize here that our analysis of the exponent of diffusion ( @xmath4 ) is restricted to the intermediate regime ( itr ) , which is found before the onset of the true `` long - time '' limit ( i.e. @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "see also discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath11 , the msd @xmath12 for any pairwise interaction potential if the system fulfills the sf ( single - file ) condition , i.e , no particle crossings are allowed .",
    "the reason is that the clustering of particles , observed in our work due to the attractive interaction , can be considered as a system of bigger particles with lower effective particle density and smaller diffusion constant .",
    "these clusters should have the msd @xmath12 but now at a much larger time scale , which we do not consider in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model system and the numerical methods used in our study , including the approximations and limitations of our model . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the different interaction regimes of our system .",
    "the dynamics in the strong magnetic field case is analyzed in sec .",
    "the weak magnetic field case is discussed in sec .",
    "v and in sec .",
    "vi , we further investigate the strength of the magnetic field on diffusion .",
    "finally , we present the conclusions of our work in sec .",
    "our system consists of @xmath13 interacting dipolar ferromagnetic particles confined in a quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) channel and which is in contact with a thermal bath at absolute temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the pair interaction potential @xmath15 is given by the sum of the dipole - dipole term @xmath16 and the short - range repulsion @xmath17 , such as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the interparticle separation vector between a pair of particles @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the permanent magnetic moment of particle @xmath20 , @xmath23 is the diameter of each particle and @xmath24 is an energy parameter which characterizes the short - range repulsion between the particles and prevent them from coalescing in a single point @xcite .",

    "the interaction torque @xmath33 between particles is given by @xmath34 ( see appendix ) .",

    "( [ eqmov2 ] ) are related to the potential energy of a dipole due to the magnetic field generated by all the other dipoles @xmath47 and the potential energy of a dipole in the presence of the external magnetic field @xmath48 respectively .",

[ figueff ] ) . on the other hand ,",

    "recall that for large values of @xmath37 ( @xmath158 ) , the dipoles were almost completely aligned with the field .",
    "the increase in the rotation of the dipoles thus leads to a slowing down of the translational diffusion , i.e. , @xmath4 decreases with decreasing @xmath37 .     as a function of the time @xmath6 for @xmath127 and ( a ) @xmath157 ,",

    "the fact that for weak magnetic fields the exponent of diffusion is smaller than @xmath139 ( i.e. the slowing down of translational diffusion ) was explained by the weak coupling of the dipoles with the external field , leading to an increase in the rotational motion of the dipoles . note that the value of @xmath154 only holds for the itr regime , as discussed in the introduction . in both cases ( i.e. strong and weak external magnetic fields ) ,",
