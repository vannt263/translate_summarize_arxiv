    "the wmap experiment @xcite has recently detected the reionization of the universe through the large - angle polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "rescattering of cmb radiation bearing a quadrupole temperature anisotropy leads to a small linear polarization which is then correlated with the temperature anisotropy itself .",
    "it was through this cross - correlation that wmap measured the total optical depth to thomson scattering , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the cmb power spectra potentially contain more information than the optical depth integrated over the whole ionization history @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the nature of the ionizing sources is not currently well - understood ( e.g.  @xcite , c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , and therefore the detailed ionization history should not be treated in the traditional cmb approach of adding well - motivated model parameters to a parameter estimation chain .",
    "attempts to do so can result in biases and conflicting results .",
    "for example , using an ionization history derived from a particular numerical prescription @xcite it was found that the partially ionized epoch was undetectable in the cmb , while analyses using semi - analytic models @xcite showed that the predicted multiple epochs of reionization and partial recombination can be detected @xcite . as another example , by assuming an overly simplistic step function model for reionization , the total optical depth @xmath1 in the semi - analytic models can be mis - estimated by up to a few @xmath2 @xcite ; while not a large amount it is already approaching the statistical errors in the first year wmap data .",
    "these uncertainties argue for a more model - independent approach to the phenomenology of reionization in the cmb . in this paper , we begin by considering a complete basis for the ionization history in  [ sec : model ] . in  [ sec : info ] , we employ a principal component analysis to isolate the cmb reionization observables . throughout",
    "we work in a flat @xmath3cdm cosmology with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the absence of systematic errors ,",
    "most of the ionization history information comes from the power spectrum of the @xmath8-mode polarization @xmath9 as opposed to the temperature - polarization cross correlation measured by wmap @xcite and for simplicity we will here consider only this power spectrum .",
    "nevertheless the main results are applicable to the cross power spectrum as well .",
    "to zeroth order , the total thomson optical depth parameterizes the effects of reionization independently of the specific model for the ionization history .",
    "firstly , the acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectra are lowered by @xmath10 in amplitude .",
    "because the effect is degenerate with a change in the initial normalization of the curvature fluctuations @xmath11 , it is absorbed into fixing the combination @xmath12 .",
    "secondly , rescattering generates large angle temperature fluctuations through the doppler effect and thirdly , it generates large angle polarization .",
    "both effects have an rms that depends mainly on @xmath1 but since the primordial polarization is free of large angle contributions , it is the better probe of reionization .",
    "finally there are further signals from inhomogeneous scattering that appear beyond the damping tail ( @xmath13 ) but whose phenomenology is inextricably tied to the model for the ionizing sources ; we will not consider them further here .",
    "= 3.25truein    in detail , the residual temperature and polarization effects depend on the reionization history , mainly through a sensitivity to the horizon scale at the epoch of rescattering @xcite .",
    "we assume the hydrogen ionization fraction @xmath14 to be a free function of redshift .",
    "a complete basis for this function can be formed from a series of delta functions in redshift .",
    "we approximate this series as kronecker delta functions @xmath15 spaced by @xmath16 with linear interpolation between the points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xe ] ) .",
    "the spacing is chosen to capture all of the information in the cmb and also be sufficiently fine to reproduce features in the ionization model .",
    "we take @xmath17 throughout",
    ".    a specific model can then be represented as a sum over the delta function modes in the approximation of linear interpolation between the points .",
    "consider a fiducial ionization history with a hydrogen ionization fraction of @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ionization fraction coming out of standard recombination ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xe ] ) .",
    "compare that to a step function ionization with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xe ] ) .",
    "both models have @xmath29 but differ in the coherence scale of the polarization .",
    "these two models are clearly distinguishable in principle ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cl ] , top ) and so more information than the optical depth can be extracted from precise measurements @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath30 may be simply appended to the usual cmb parameter estimation chain but that approach has several drawbacks .",
    "the @xmath16 spacing of the points is arbitrary and moreover for @xmath17 the parameters are highly degenerate and would cause numerical problems in a likelihood analysis . to see this ,",
    "consider the effect of a delta - function perturbation to the fiducial ionization history given above and quantify the response in the power spectrum as a transfer matrix @xmath31 where we vary @xmath21 as motivated by the range in redshift over which reionization is expected to occur @xcite .",
    "the derivative is calculated by a double - sided finite difference of @xmath32 .",
    "this matrix may be viewed as a transfer function for small perturbations from the fiducial model .",
    "the main feature is that perturbations at relatively low redshift appear at low @xmath33 and those at high redshift at high @xmath33 .",
    "the perturbations also introduce ringing into the power spectrum which is retained in the full model .",
    "because neighboring redshift modes produce similar responses in the power spectrum , there exists a degeneracy in the recovery of @xmath15 .",
    "= 3.25truein    under the linear approximation , we can pose the inverse problem as the recovery of @xmath15 from the linear response @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents noise sources .",
    "instrumental noise levels that roughly bracket the expectations for wmap and planck @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] but systematic effects such as residual foreground contamination will likely dominate the errors . with a characterization of the statistical properties of the noise and a regularization of the reconstructed signal , e.g. by placing a smoothness criteria on @xmath30 through a two - point prior , standard techniques such as wiener filtering allow for model reconstruction .",
    "it is important to take a fiducial model that is close to the observed power spectrum since linear response will only hold for small perturbations .",
    "it will also be important below in that the cosmic variance of the assumed signal sets the fundamental noise in the reconstruction .",
    "we chose a fiducial model with an ionization @xmath36 in the parameterized regime so that , neglecting helium reionization @xcite , the maximal excursion from the model is @xmath37 .",
    "as a worst case scenario consider the reconstruction of the step function ionization in fig .",
    "[ fig : xe ] from the fiducial model , @xmath15 and the transfer matrix . here",
    "all of the parameters @xmath30 are offset from the fiducial choice by the maximum value .",
    "the predicted power spectrum is shown in dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] ( top ) .",
    "note the agreement is still quite good at the peak of the power but fails in the low signal regime where small errors in the transfer function lead to large fractional effects . still , given realistic measurement noise and an iterated choice of fiducial model",
    ", the linear response approximation can provide useful tools for representing the data .",
    "a detailed consideration is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "instead we will show that a modification of the forward approach suffices to extract essentially all of the information in the cmb .",
    "to better quantify the information contained in the power spectrum , let us consider the ultimate limit of an all - sky experiment that is cosmic variance limited .",
    "the variance of the power spectrum is then given by @xmath38 and hence the covariance of the ionization parameters @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the fisher matrix .",
    "the structure of the transfer matrix implies a large covariance between estimates of @xmath15 and renders the delta - function representation difficult to visualize .",
    "= 3.00truein    consider instead the principal component representation based on the orthonormal eigenvectors of the fisher matrix , decomposed as @xmath41 for a fixed @xmath42 , the @xmath43 specify linear combinations of the @xmath15 for a new representation of the data @xmath44 where the covariance matrix of the mode amplitudes is given by @xmath45 in other words , the eigenvectors form a new basis that is complete and yields uncorrelated measurements with variance given by the inverse eigenvalue .",
    "the largest eigenvalues correspond to the minimum variance directions and the first 5 are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen ] .",
    "the first two correspond essentially to the average ionization at high redshift and low redshift respectively .",
    "the lower panel shows the directions with the 5 highest variances . here",
    "neighboring delta modes with similar responses compensate each other to leave the observable power spectrum unchanged .",
    "the rms of each mode is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode ] . because the ionization fraction can not be negative and the amplitude of each mode is @xmath46 , only the first 5 modes with @xmath47 have useful information .",
    "an added benefit of the principal component representation is that the structure in the lowest modes is invariant under refinement of the binning scheme @xmath16 . in @xmath33 space",
    ", the first mode controls the high @xmath33 power , the second the low @xmath33 power and the third through fifth adjust the ringing in the spectrum .",
    "these eigenmodes provide a good meeting ground between observations and models .",
    "the amplitude @xmath48 of these 5 best modes may be added to the usual cmb parameter estimation chain and the results compared to model predictions for @xmath48 without significant loss of information . as an example , in figure [ fig : clmode ] we have represented a complex ionization history ( inset , thick - dashed ) through its first 1 through 5 eigenmodes . for this ionization history the first 3 eigenmodes suffice to recover the observable power spectrum .",
    "the temperature polarization cross spectra converges similarly .",
    "note that in the eigenmode analysis the assumed ionization fraction can go unphysically negative but this causes no difficulty for a boltzmann code and no ambiguity once interpreted as a mode amplitude .",
    "= 3.25truein    finally it is interesting to consider the implications for the total optical depth or equivalently errors on the initial amplitude of fluctuations @xmath49 .",
    "a precise normalization of the initial conditions is crucial to dark energy studies utilizing the evolution of structure @xcite .",
    "each principal component mode perturbs the total optical depth by @xmath50 this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode ] ( lower curve ) .",
    "the best constrained mode bears a @xmath1 uncertainty of @xmath51 .",
    "note that although the rms uncertainty in the higher modes is large , the optical depth contributed by them is compensatingly small .",
    "given that the total optical depth variation is @xmath52 , the total variance is given by @xmath53 we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode ] the cumulative variance from increasing the number of modes included in the sum .",
    "the contributions are again dominated by the first few modes and placing a prior of @xmath54 against unphysical values of @xmath14 is enough to eliminate the small contribution from the higher modes .",
    "thus , even with an arbitrary ionization history , the total optical depth can in principle be measured to @xmath55 by an ideal experiment .",
    "note that this is an uncertainty due to cosmic variance and not a bias .",
    "in the example of fig .  [",
    "fig : clmode ] , the total optical depth with 0 , 2 and 4 modes is @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 compared with a true optical depth of @xmath59 .",
    "we have studied the effect of an arbitrary ionization history on the cmb polarization power spectrum and shown that the information lies in 5 broadly distributed modes in redshift .",
    "we have taken a complete basis for a range of redshifts @xmath60 but this can be extended as needed .",
    "the amplitude of these modes represent a compact description of the observable properties of reionization in the cmb and can be easily predicted as a filtered version of any given model for the ionization fraction .",
    "they can therefore serve as a model - independent tool for data analysis and model testing .",
    "they also can ultimately remove any bias in the measurement of the total optical depth , or equivalently the initial amplitude of fluctuations , leaving a residual uncertainty from cosmic variance at the 1% level ."
