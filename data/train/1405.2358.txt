    "compared to legendrian knots in @xmath1 , little is known about knotted legendrian submanifolds @xmath2 embedded in @xmath3 .",
    "one reason is that in higher dimensions there are no standard representations of embedded legendrian submanifolds that enable one to study with the same facility as front projections or lagrangian projections of legendrian knots in @xmath1 .",
    "for example , one may easily compute the classical invariants of thurston - bennequin and rotation numbers by looking at the front projection of a knot in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the classical invariants are quite effective at distinguishing many knots up to legendrian isotopy : torus knots , for example have been shown to be classified by their classical invariants ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "while the thurston - bennequin number may be generalized to higher dimensions , it is not always as useful as it is for knots in dimension @xmath5 . in the case we study in this paper , knotted legendrian tori @xmath6 , the thurston - bennequin invariant is well defined ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , but uninteresting since it is always equal to zero .",
    "in fact , the thurston - bennequin number in @xmath7 equals @xmath8 when @xmath9 is even . furthermore , while topological knot type provides an additional invariant for legendrian knots in @xmath1 , all knotted legendrian surfaces in @xmath10 are topologically equivalent provided they are of the same genus .",
    "the rotation class is harder to generalize to higher dimensions . unlike the thurston - bennequin number , which may be defined in terms of a linking number , the rotation number requires the computation of the homotopy class of a map from @xmath11 to the space of lagrangians of @xmath12 with symplectic structure induced by the contact form on @xmath10 . since writing down this map is non - trivial this invariant is more difficult to compute in higher dimensions .",
    "lagrangian hypercube diagrams overcome the difficulties involved in studying knotted legendrian tori in @xmath10 , by providing a way to construct explicit embeddings of legendrian tori . using the explicit map defined by a lagrangian hypercube diagram",
    "we demonstrate that the rotation class may be calculated combinatorially as follows :    [ thm : main1 ] given a lagrangian hypercube diagram @xmath13 with lagrangian grid diagram projections @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath16 , and let @xmath17 be the embedded legendrian torus determined by the lift of the lagrangian torus defined by @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be generated by @xmath20 and @xmath21 as in theorem  [ thm : lift ] .",
    "then , the rotation class of @xmath11 , @xmath22 , satisfies : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the winding number of the immersed curve determined by @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the winding number can be computed combinatorically from the lagrangian grid diagram projection : @xmath25    let @xmath18 be the lagrangian hypercube diagram constructed from the lagrangian grid diagrams shown in figure [ fig:5x5unknots ] ( theorem  [ thm : construction ] ) .",
    "the lagrangian hypercube determines an immersed lagrangian torus @xmath26 ( theorem  [ thm : torus ] ) .",
    "the lift of the lagrangian torus @xmath26 is a knotted , embedded legendrian torus @xmath11 ( theorem  [ thm : lift ] ) . by theorem [ thm : main1 ] , the rotation class of the legendrian torus @xmath11 is @xmath27 .",
    "recall that the maslov index , as defined in @xcite and @xcite , may be viewed as a map @xmath28 .",
    "[ cor : main11 ] for @xmath29 , the maslov index is @xmath30    the maslov number of the torus @xmath11 is the smallest positive number that is the maslov index of some nontrivial loop ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . thus corollary [ cor : main11 ] enables us to compute the maslov number of @xmath11 as follows :    [ cor : main12 ] the maslov number of @xmath11 is the non - negative number @xmath31 .    in @xcite , ekholm , etnyre , and sullivan compute the classical invariants for legendrian tori obtained by front - spinning , showing that , in particular , the rotation class of the surface so obtained , is determined by the rotation number of the front projection used in the construction .",
    "thus , their construction leads to tori with rotation class of the form @xmath32 .",
    "not only are we able to construct legendrian tori in which both factors of the torus are knotted , but we show that legendrian tori constructed from hypercube diagrams realize every possible pair of integers under the isomorphism defined by @xmath18 . in particular , we get examples where the rotation class is @xmath32 in the following theorem by taking one of the knots to be a trivial knot with rotation number zero :    [ thm : main2 ] let @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 be any two topological knots in @xmath1 .",
    "then there is a hypercube diagram , @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are lagrangian grid diagrams representing legendrian knots in @xmath1 with the same topological knot type as @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the legendrian torus @xmath11 determined by the lift of the lagrangian torus determined by @xmath18 satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "theorem [ thm : main2 ] is a statement about the existence of lagrangian hypercube diagrams .",
    "the methods used in the proof to find lagrangian hypercube diagrams lead in general to excessively large diagrams . in practice , however , lagrangian hypercube diagrams are easy to build by hand .",
    "knot theory benefited greatly because of the development of nice representations for the knots : braids , knot projections , grid diagrams , etc .",
    "theorem [ thm : main1 ] and [ thm : main2 ] together can be viewed as our attempt to create similar useful representations of legendrian tori in @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , computers can be used to easily generate and compute examples ( see theorem [ thm : construction ] ) .",
    "this paper stands alone as one of the first papers to explicitly compute classical legendrian invariants for a large class of knotted legendrian submanifolds in @xmath3 for @xmath37 ( cf .",
    "we see the potential for much more : this paper contains key elements in the computing the gradings and dimensions of the moduli spaces used in computing the differential in contact homology .",
    "our future work will be on how to use the representations and the calculations in this paper to compute the contact homology algorithmically directly from lagrangian hypercube diagrams .",
    "in fact , we were particularly interested in studying the contact homology of embedded legendrian tori in @xmath10 ( or @xmath38 ) because of their relationship to special lagrangian cones used to study the string theory model in physics .",
    "briefly , according to this model , our universe is a product of the standard minkowsky space @xmath12 with a calabi - yau @xmath5-fold @xmath39 . based upon physical grounds , the syz - conjecture of strominger , yau , and zaslov ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) expects that this calabi - yau 3-fold can be given a fibration by special lagrangian @xmath5-tori with possibly some singular fibers .",
    "to make this idea rigorous one needs control over the singularities , which are not understood well .",
    "one method used to study these singularities ( cf .",
    "haskins @xcite and joyce @xcite ) is to model them locally as special lagrangian cones @xmath40 .",
    "a special lagrangian cone can be characterized by its associated link @xmath41 ( the link of the singularity ) , which turns out to be a minimal legendrian surface .",
    "when the link type of @xmath11 is a sphere , then @xmath42 must be a special lagrangian plane .",
    "the interesting tractable case appears to be when the link type is an embedded torus .",
    "several authors ( cf .",
    "castro - urbano @xcite , haskins @xcite , joyce @xcite ) have shown that there exist infinite families of nontrivial special lagrangian cones arising from minimal embedded legendrian tori .",
    "some work is already being done by aganagic , ekholm , ng , and vafa @xcite to understand the connection between contact homology and lagrangian fillings .",
    "we see this paper as possibly laying groundwork for developing combinatorial tools to understand special lagrangian cones through the lens of contact homology .",
    "in section [ section : rotation ] we present a definition for the rotation class in dimension @xmath43 and prove that it is characterized by a pair of integers .",
    "section [ section : grids ] discusses lagrangian grid diagrams , which enable us to define a lagrangian hypercube diagram in section [ section : hypercubediagrams ] . in section [ section : torus ]",
    "we prove that a lagrangian hypercube diagram represents an immersed lagrangian torus in dimension 4 .",
    "this torus is shown in section [ section : lift ] to lift to a legendrian torus in @xmath10 with the standard contact structure .",
    "we then prove theorem [ thm : main1 ] ( section [ section : compute ] ) and close with a proof of theorem [ thm : main2 ] and further examples ( section [ section : examples ] ) .",
    "in @xcite the classical legendrian invariants of thurston - bennequin number and rotation number are generalized for @xmath7 .",
    "we recall the definition of rotation class for @xmath10 here .",

    "when @xmath75 , the rotation class can be nontrivial .",
    "in fact ,    [ isom ] the rotation class for a legendrian torus can be thought of as an element in @xmath76 via the isomorphism @xmath77",

    "the existence of the isomorphism in theorem [ isom ] is , by itself , not useful in general for calculations due to the fact that the isomorphism depends heavily upon the choice of loops on the torus used to define the map : a generic embedding @xmath92 does not have a preferred basis for homology ( one can precompose with any element of @xmath93 for example ) .",

    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 in theorem  [ thm : lift ] ) .",
    "it is these choices together with theorem  [ isom ] that allows us to write down our `` preferred '' calculations of rotation class and maslov index for loops in the embedded legendrian torus .",

    "let @xmath107 be a @xmath108-oriented grid diagram ( cf .",

    "typically one assigns the @xmath110-parallel segments in @xmath107 to be the over - strands at any crossing .",
    "however , in the following definition we will ignore such crossing conditions , and think of @xmath107 as an immersed @xmath111 .",
    "an _ immersed grid diagram _ is an oriented grid diagram @xmath112 with no crossing data specified .",
    "an immersed grid diagram @xmath112 may be thought of as a mapping @xmath104 .",

    "given a lagrangian projection of a legendrian knot @xmath11 , one may compute the rotation number as follows . use the vector field @xmath136 to trivialize @xmath137 .",
    "then the rotation number may be calculated to be the winding number of the tangent vector to @xmath11 with respect to this trivialization : @xmath138 for a lagrangian grid , this is simply a signed count of the corners of @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath139 be the collection of corners in @xmath112 .",

    "<S> in this paper we show how to combinatorically compute the rotation class of a large family of embedded legendrian tori in @xmath0 with the standard contact form . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we give a formula to compute the maslov index for any loop on the torus and compute the maslov number of the legendrian torus . </S>",
    "<S> these formulas are a necessary component in computing contact homology . </S>",
