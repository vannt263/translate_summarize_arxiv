    "luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars are debated subjects of modern astrophysics , because they signify a key stage in the fate of the most massive stars .",
    "such stars may experience an unstable post - main - sequence lbv stage before becoming wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "lbvs lose most of the hydrogen ( h ) envelope rapidly ( typically 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 , up to 10@xmath4 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , forming massive circumstellar nebulae like the spectacular _ homunculus _ surrounding @xmath5-car .",
    "later massive stars eventually explode as type ib / c supernovae ( sne ) ( see the case of sn 2001am , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there is increasing evidence that even lbvs can _ directly _ explode producing core - collapse sne @xcite .",
    "an attempt to characterize lbvs was done by @xcite .",
    "however , lbvs do not form a homogeneous group of stars , since they span quite a large range of magnitudes and variability types .",
    "some of them show an s - dor variability type . during this phase ,",
    "the star expands and contracts with some regularity over timescales of years , varying its apparent temperature ( and , as a consequence , spectral type ) .",
    "its bolometric luminosity is generally not thought to change significantly ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the upper limit to the luminosity / mass ratio for static stellar atmospheres ( the so - called `` eddington limit '' ) is not violated . with s - dor ,",
    "other classical examples of this variability type are ag car in the galaxy and r 127 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "as mentioned by @xcite , the s - dor variability has typical periods of few years ( _ short s - dor phase _ ) or decades ( _ long s - dor phase _ ) .",
    "other lbvs occasionally experience giant eruptions , during which they increase their luminosity and can reach @xmath6 -14 ( 4 - 6 mag brighter than their typical quiescence magnitudes ) , temporarily exceeding the eddington limit .",
    "the most popular giant eruption of an lbv in our galaxy is that of @xmath5-car during the 19th century .",
    "spectra of lbvs giant eruptions are characterized by incipient narrow ( with full - width - at - half - maximum velocity , @xmath7 , lower than 1000 km s@xmath1 ) h lines in emission , resembling those of type iin sne .",
    "for this reason and their relatively high peak luminosities , they are occasionally misclassified as real sn explosions . however , since the stars survive the eruptions , they are labelled as _",

    "the first registered outburst of the variable star in ngc 3432 discussed in this paper was designated as sn 2000ch @xcite .",
    "hereafter , this transient will be dubbed as ngc 3432 2000-ot .",
    "contrary to genuine sne iin , sn impostors are less luminous and their spectra do not show clear evidence of broad lines ( @xmath8 3000 - 4000 km s@xmath1 ) produced by sn ejecta .",
    "sn impostors will hereafter be referred to without the misleading `` sn '' label .    in this paper",
    "we will analyse the october 2008 , april 2009 and november 2009 outbursts of the same variable in ngc 3432 that was responsible for ngc 3432 2000-ot ( see the wide discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "we attempt to reconstruct the variability history of this star and derive information on its nature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the variable in ngc 3432 and describe its environment . in sect . 3 and sect . 4 photometric and spectroscopic evolutions are presented , while in sect .",
    "5 we analyse the evolution of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the variable . a discussion on the nature of the star follows in sect . 6 .",
    "north is up , east is to the left.,width=317 ]    ngc 3432 is a well - studied irregular galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) interacting with a low - surface brightness dwarf companion ( ugc 5983 ) , which is located south - west of the main galaxy ( figure [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "this interacting system is included in arp s catalogue @xcite with the label arp 206 .",
    "@xcite noted the presence of an extended arm of the galaxy in the north - east direction , which ends with a luminous clump in which the variable star lies .",
    "the disturbed morphology of ngc 3432 and the presence of an extended north - east region detached from the main body of the galaxy likely result from the tidal interaction of ngc 3432 with ugc 5983 ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite determined for ngc 3432 a star formation rate ( sfr ) of 0.49 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 from uv data , and of 0.32 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 from h@xmath10 luminosity .",
    "interaction between galaxies is well known to trigger star formation , and the relatively low sfr observed in ngc 3432 may appear as an inconsistency .",
    "however , a starburst episode may occur with a significant delay ( 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath12 yrs ) with respect to the major tidal distortions @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite arp 206 is consistent with this scenario , and would currently be in a pre - starburst phase .    measuring the intensity of the [ o ii ] @xmath13 7320,7330 doublet and the intensity ratio of strong [ o ii ] @xmath0 3727 and [ o iii ] @xmath13 4959,5007 lines in h ii regions , @xcite estimated an average o abundance of 12 log ( o / h ) = 8.3 @xmath14 0.1 dex for ngc 3432 which is comparable to the metallicity of the lmc ( @xmath158.35 dex , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the metallicity in the region of the variable star might be significantly different from this average value .",
    "the distance of the galaxy system is computed through the recessional velocity corrected for local group infall into virgo = 208 @xmath14 9 km s@xmath1 @xcite ] .",
    "the hyperleda database gives @xmath16 = 779 km s@xmath1 , providing a distance of 10.8 @xmath14 1.2 mpc ( distance modulus @xmath17 = 30.17 @xmath14 0.56 mag , adopting @xmath18 = 72 @xmath14 8 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite quote a galactic reddening of @xmath19= 0.013 in the direction of ngc 3432 , while the peripheral position of the objects in the host galaxy suggests a modest internal reddening .",
    "this is also indicated from the lack of narrow interstellar absorption lines in the spectra of the variable star ( see sect . [ sp ] ) .",
    "therefore , hereafter we will adopt a total reddening of @xmath19= 0.013 mag , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a variable star in ngc 3432 on 2000 may 3 ut was reported by @xcite at the position @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( equinox j2000.0 ) , which is 123@xmath22 east and 180@xmath22 north of the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "the transient had an unfiltered peak magnitude of @xmath23 = 17.4 .",
    "a kait image was obtained 4 days prior to this on 2000 april 29 showing nothing brighter than @xmath23 = 19 at the position of the variable @xcite .",
    "the low luminosity and the spectra dominated by narrow balmer lines were consistent with a sn impostor ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "wagner et al .",
    "presented optical plus near - infrared light curves of ngc 3432 2000-ot covering a period of @xmath153 months , and noted a somewhat erratic variability over very short timescales ( of the order of weeks ) .",
    "additional sparse archive observations led these authors to conclude that no major outburst was previously observed , and the likely quiescent magnitude of the lbv was around @xmath24 = 19.4 @xmath14 0.4 mag .",
    "they also registered a deep magnitude minimum ( @xmath25 20.8 ) soon after the luminosity peak , and interpreted it as the result of dust formation , occultation or eclipse phase .",
    "we will show in sect .",
    "[ ph ] that the star has been detected ( occasionally ) at a magnitude even fainter than @xmath26 21 in subsequent follow - up observations .",
    "another transient was announced on 2008 october 7.12 ut by @xcite at a position @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( equinox j2000.0 ) , very close ( but apparently not coincident ) to that of the 2000 outburst ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the new transient ( labelled as ngc 3432 2008-ot in this paper ) had an apparent peak magnitude ( @xmath24 = 17.5 ) similar to that of 2000-ot .",
    "its faint absolute magnitude ( @xmath29 @xmath30 -12.7 ) was again consistent with that of a sn impostor .    in order to prove that the position of 2008-ot was coincident with that of 2000-ot",
    ", relative astrometric calibration was performed using as template a good - quality image of the 2008 transient and as target image the discovery frame of the 2000 transient obtained with the 0.76-m kait telescope ( filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ) . in order to align the two images",
    ", we identified 15 sources in common to both images and measured their centroid positions .",
    "this allowed us to derive a geometric transformation for the two images ( implying a shift , a scaling to a common pixel scale and a rotation ) using the iraf package geomap . to employ a general non - linear transformation",
    ", we selected a 2nd - order polynomial model that computes the geometric alignment function .",
    "the images were finally registered to the target image using geotran .",
    "the accuracy of the alignment is 0.145 px in the x - axis and 0.154 px in y. accounting for the pixel scale of the target image , the rms errors of the transformation in the two axes are 116 mas and 123 mas .",
    "we measured the position of the transients in the two images with aperture photometry and found in the transformed images a discrepancy in the position of the two transients of @xmath31 = 0.039 px ( 31 mas ) and @xmath32 = 0.013 px ( 10 mas ) , which are well below the uncertainty of the transformation .",
    "we are therefore confident that the two transients were two major outbursts of the same stellar source ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "more precise coordinates than those previously reported for the ngc 3432 variable , as determined from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) images , are @xmath33 and @xmath3495 ( equinox j2000.0 ) .",
    "unfiltered amateur images showing the region of the variable star at 4 epochs during the period 2006 - 2008 are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "finally , two further outbursts of the variable in ngc 3432 were registered in april 2009 ( hereafter labelled as 2009-ot1 ) and november 2009 ( 2009-ot2 ) , during routine monitoring observations of the star .",
    "after the discovery by @xcite , we started a systematic monitoring of the variable in the optical bands . at the same time , we collected a number of pre - discovery images of ngc 3432 from amateur astronomers and professional telescopes available through science data archives .",
    "the calibration of the optical photometry obtained with standard johnson - bessell filters has been performed using the local standard star magnitudes presented in @xcite for the b , v and r bands , while the u and i band data have been calibrated independently .",
    "the calibration of the sloan filter photometry was performed using the sdss photometry catalogue .",
    "johnson - bessell and sloan magnitudes ( or magnitude limits ) of the variable in ngc 3432 are reported in appendix ( tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the light curves , including the photometry of @xcite and spanning a period of almost 16 years , are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the right - hand panels show in detail the evolution of the variable during the 4 major outbursts : from top to bottom 2009-ot2 , 2009-ot1 , 2008-ot and 2000-ot .",
    "as already mentioned , the outbursts showed comparable peak magnitudes ( @xmath26 17.5 - 18.5 mag ) and a number of subsequent luminosity fluctuations , although the post - peak evolution is somewhat different in the 4 cases .",
    "this is clearly visible when the r band absolute light curves of the 4 outbursts are plotted together ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "while 2000-ot showed a fast post - peak decline , with a deep minimum reached after a few days , 2008-ot and 2009-ot1 reached the minimum 2 - 3 months after maximum .",
    "we can summarize the photometric evolution of the 4 outbursts as follows :    * * 2000-ot .",
    "* during this outburst , the star reached a peak magnitude of @xmath24 = 17.4 ( @xmath35 -12.8 ) on may 3rd , 2000 .",
    "the maximum was followed by a steep decline of 3.5 mag in about a week ( but an observation obtained 2 days after maximum already showed the transient being 2.9 mag fainter than at peak ) .",
    "a sequence of secondary peaks was also observed ( at magnitude around 18.6 ) , with a temporal distance of about 12 - 15 days between each other ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure [ fig3 ] , bottom - right panel ) .",
    "* * 2008-ot .",
    "* during this eruptive episode , the variable arrived at a maximum magnitude of @xmath24 = 17.5 ( @xmath35 -12.7 , october 7th , 2008 ) , and experienced a rebrightening ( @xmath26 18 ) at @xmath1518 days after the main maximum .",
    "the rebrightening was followed by a large luminosity drop ( more than 3 mag ) .",
    "although the light curve is poorly sampled in this period , the star probably remained fainter than @xmath25 20.5 ( @xmath36 21.5 ) for about 1 month .",
    "then its luminosity increased again , reaching a peak of @xmath25 18.6 at about 70 days after the main outburst .",
    "finally the luminosity slowly declined and leveled off at @xmath26 19.5 ( see figure [ fig3 ] , right , second panel from bottom ) . *",
    "* 2009-ot1 . *",
    "surprisingly , about 200 days after the previous outburst the variable brightened again . in this episode",
    "the peak magnitude ( on april 22nd , 2009 ) was around @xmath25 17.9 ( @xmath37 -12.3 ) .",
    "the primary peak was followed by a number of magnitude oscillations that occurred on shorter time - scales than those observed in 2008-ot .",
    "they were followed by a dramatic drop of @xmath38 @xmath39 3.3 mag from the peak to the minimum ( figure [ fig4 ] ) . *",
    "* 2009-ot2 . * a further rebrightening of the variable in ngc 3432",
    "was finally registered in november 2009 , again * @xmath15 * 200 - 210 days after the previous episode .",
    "this might be either a coincidence in the luminosity fluctuations or , alternatively , might suggest some periodicity in the major episodes of stellar variability .",
    "the consequences of this latter scenario will be discussed in sect .",
    "interestingly , the first maximum of 2009-ot2 reached @xmath37 -11.7 , but was followed after 8 days by a second peak that was even slightly brighter ( @xmath37 -12.1 , see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "after the second peak , the luminosity of the star dropped down by more than 2 mag in @xmath151 month .     = -0.177 mag ( see caption in figure [ fig3]).,width=328 ]    the comprehensive light curve ( period 1994 - 2009 , see figure [ fig3 ] , main panel ) shows a rather erratic evolution .",
    "luminosity peaks occur on unusually short timescales and the range of spanned magnitudes ( @xmath40 @xmath15 4 mag , figure [ fig4 ] ) are atypical for an s - dor - like event . together with the main peaks we also note a few sparse detections at magnitudes 18.5 - 19.5 , and some minima ( e.g. at jds 2449475 and 2453081 ) .",
    "such optical deficits can be possibly due to post outburst dust formation episodes ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "the implications of this unusual photometric evolution in constraining the nature of the variable star will be discussed in sect .",
    "5 .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we compare the r band absolute light curve of the variable in ngc 3432 during the period from october 2008 to june 2009 with those of the sn impostors 1997bs @xcite and 2009ip @xcite , the 2004 luminous eruption in ugc 4904 that heralded sn 2006jc ( hereafter ugc 4904 ot 2004 - 1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and two additional under - luminous transients whose nature ( core - collapse sn , lbv outburst , peculiar luminous nova ) is still debated : m85 ot 2006 - 1 and 2008s @xcite .",
    "the peak magnitudes of the ngc 3432 variable ( in the range -12.1 to -12.8 ) are much fainter than those of 1997bs ( @xmath35 -15.3 ) and 2009ip ( @xmath35 -14.6 ) , marginally fainter than those of 2008s and ugc 4904 ot 2004 - 1 ( @xmath35 -13.7 ) .",
    "however , they are comparable with the maximum magnitude of m85 ot 2006 - 1 @xcite , although the two transients have different photometric evolution . m85 ot 2006 - 1 , indeed , presents a slowly evolving light curve with a sort of plateau , while the variable in ngc 3432 has a fast evolution , characterized by steep post - peak luminosity declines and subsequent rebrightenings similar to those observed in 2009ip @xcite and other sn impostors @xcite .    in figure [ fig6 ] long - term light curves of the ngc 3432 variable and a few well monitored lbvs and sn imposters",

    "remarkably , even though some modulation in the light curve of the variable star in ngc 3432 may suggest an s - dor - type variability , its overall characteristics are reminiscent of those of major outbursts .",
