    "in contradistinction to lower dimensions , the only firmly established quantum field theories in four dimensions ( 4d ) are either asymptotically free or so - called trivial theories .",
    "both are defined in the vicinity of gaussian fixed points , i.e. of noninteracting limit cases . in spite of numerous suggestions and circumstantial evidence ,",
    "until now no candidate for a non - gaussian fixed point in 4d has been established .",
    "the suitability of numerical simulations on the lattice for a confirmation of the existence of non - gaussian fixed points , and for an investigation of their properties , has been demonstrated in dimensions lower than four in numerous applications .",
    "for example , non - gaussian values of critical exponents can be determined by means of finite - size scaling ( fss ) or renormalization group ( rg ) analysis .",
    "several attempts to use a similar approach in 4d have encountered severe problems , however .    in this letter",
    "we reconsider the oldest candidate for a non - gaussian fixed point in the 4d lattice field theory , the phase transition between the confinement and the coulomb phases in the pure compact u(1 ) gauge theory @xcite with wilson action and extended wilson action .",
    "after various pioneering studies , e.g. @xcite , the more detailed investigations were hindered mainly by a weak two - state signal @xcite .",
    "this obscures the order of the phase transition and makes it difficult to determine critical exponents reliably .",
    "we demonstrate that the problems encountered , when considering the continuum limit at this phase transition , can be surmounted .",
    "the clues are the observation that the two - state signal disappears on lattices with spherelike topology , the construction of homogeneous spherical lattices , the use of modern fss analysis techniques , and larger computer resources .",
    "we find that at the confinement  coulomb phase transition at strong bare gauge coupling , @xmath1 = @xmath2 , the model exhibits a @xmath3 order scaling behavior well described by the values of the correlation length critical exponent @xmath4 in the range @xmath5 .",
    "the measurements have been performed at various couplings and by different methods .",
    "the most reliable determination gives @xmath6 these results are quite different from @xmath7 expected at a @xmath8 order transition , as well as from @xmath9 obtained in a gaussian theory or in the mean field approximation .",
    "this strongly suggests the existence of a continuum pure u(1 ) gauge theory with properties different from theories governed by gaussian fixed points with or without logarithmic corrections . it can be obtained from the lattice theory by the rg techniques",
    ".    detailed numerical evidence for these claims will be presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "some preliminary results have been published in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the pure u(1 ) lattice gauge theory with the villain ( periodic gaussian ) action presumably belongs to the same universality class @xcite , rigorous dual relationships imply that also the following 4d models possess a continuum limit described by the same fixed point : the coulomb gas of monopole loops@xcite , the noncompact u(1 ) higgs model at large negative squared bare mass ( frozen 4d superconductor ) @xcite , and an effective string theory equivalent to this higgs model@xcite .",
    "these findings raise once again the question , whether in strongly interacting 4d gauge field theories further non - gaussian fixed points exist , that might be of use for theories beyond the standard model .",
    "the pure compact u(1 ) gauge theory on the 4d cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( 4d torus ) can be described by the extended wilson action @xcite @xmath10,\\ ] ] with @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the plaquette angle , i.e. the argument of the product of u(1 ) link variables along a plaquette @xmath13 . taking @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath16 , one obtains for weak coupling @xmath1 the usual continuum action @xmath17 .    in one of the very first studies @xcite , restricted to the @xmath18 case ( wilson action@xcite ) and small lattices , a behavior consistent with a @xmath3 order phase transition at @xmath19",
    "was observed , and @xmath20 was found .",
    "however , any inference about the continuum limit has been hindered by the subsequent observation of a two - state signal on larger , but finite lattices@xcite .",
    "this could either be a finite - size effect , or it could imply that the phase transition at @xmath18 is actually of @xmath8 order , preventing a continuum limit at @xmath18 .    in the model with the extended wilson action ( [ action ] ) , it was found that the confinement - coulomb phase transition is clearly of @xmath8 order for @xmath21 , and weakens with decreasing @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "various studies suggested that the transition becomes @xmath3 order at slightly negative @xmath22 @xcite , or around @xmath18@xcite .",
    "the order of the transition at @xmath18 has remained a controversial subject @xcite . though the values @xmath23 have been obtained consistently by various methods @xcite , the continuum limit has not appeared to be possible .",
    "also the hope that the continuum limit might be taken at least at negative @xmath22 was spoiled by the observation of a weaker , but still significant , two - state signal on finite lattices even there@xcite .",
    "though this signal is probably only a finite - size effect , and the transition in the infinite volume limit is genuinely of @xmath3 order , it impedes a precise fss and rg analysis .",
    "it was known that monopole loops winding around the toroidal lattice occur @xcite and cause difficulties in simulations with local update algorithms . suspecting that this might be a reason for the two - state signal , two of the present authors performed simulations at @xmath18 , using the 4d surface of a 5d cubic lattice instead of the torus .",
    "they observed that on such lattices with spherelike topology the two - state signal vanishes @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the two - state signal at @xmath24 is related to the nontrivial topology of the toroidal lattice .",
    "related observations have been made for the schwinger model @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has been checked in spin models , that weak two - state signals are not washed out on lattices with spherelike topology , if they are due to a genuine @xmath8 order transition@xcite .",
    "however , the lattice on the surface of a cube is rather inhomogeneous and causes complex finite - size effects , preventing a reliable fss analysis .",
    "for our present study at @xmath24 , we have chosen again lattices with spherelike topology . to alleviate the problem of inhomogeneity",
    ", we have used lattices obtained by projecting the 4d surface sh[n ] of a 5d cubic lattice @xmath25 onto a concentric 4d sphere .",
    "on such a spherical lattice s[n ] , the curvatures concentrated on the corners , edges , etc . , of the original lattice sh[n",
    "] are approximately homogenized over the whole sphere by the weight factors @xmath26 in the action ( [ action ] ) . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the areas of the plaquette @xmath13 on s[n ] , and of its dual , as on any irregular , e.g. random lattice @xcite .",
    "these areas are determined by means of a two - triangle approximation of the plaquettes .",
    "it has been checked in some spin and gauge models with @xmath3 order transitions that universality for spherical lattices holds , and that the fss analysis works very well if @xmath29 is used as a linear size parameter , @xmath30 being the volume of the sphere s[n ] @xcite .",
    "another new feature in our study of the theory is the fss analysis of the first zero @xmath31 of the partition function in the complex plane of the coupling @xmath32 ( fisher zero ) . applying the multihistogram reweighting method @xcite for its determination ,",
    "the expected fss behavior @xmath33 has been used for measuring @xmath4 .",
    "this has turned out to be superior to  though consistent with  the more common fss analysis of specific - heat and cumulant extrema .",
    "finally , we have performed the fss study of the confinement - coulomb transition not only at @xmath18 , but also at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this allows us to compare the behavior of the system at @xmath18 , where the order of the transition is disputed , with the commonly expected @xmath3 order behavior at negative @xmath22 , and to test the universality of the critical properties .",
    "we have performed simulations @xcite on s[n ] for @xmath36 between 4 and 12 .",
    "note that @xmath37 $ ] has about @xmath38 lattice points .",
    "the values of @xmath32 were chosen in the immediate neighborhood of its critical values for @xmath39 , and @xmath35 .",
    "for each lattice size at each @xmath22 value , we have accumulated typically @xmath40 updates distributed over 8  12 @xmath32 points .",
    "we have found no indication of a two - state signal , neither in the individual , nor in the multihistogram distributions of @xmath41 , at any of the three @xmath22 values .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  1 for @xmath18",
    ". the values of the studied cumulants at their respective extrema are compatible with a @xmath3 order transition .",
    "the critical behavior at all three @xmath22 values is very similar , except that the transition weakens with decreasing @xmath22 , which means that larger lattices are needed for the same height of the specific - heat peak .    in test runs at @xmath42 a two - state signal has been clearly observed .",
    "this confirms that at sufficiently large positive @xmath22 the phase transition is of @xmath8 order , and that the spherical lattice s[n ] does not wash out such a signal .",
    "furthermore , at all three investigated values @xmath24 , the fss analysis assuming a @xmath3 order transition works remarkably well and leads to consistent results for all observables @xcite .",
    "all our evidence thus points towards the conclusion that the phase transition is of 2@xmath43 order for @xmath24 .",
    ".results for @xmath4 from fits to @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 at various @xmath22 .",
    "the indicated errors are statistical . [ cols=\">,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  1 we present results for the critical exponent @xmath4 obtained from all the data with @xmath47 .",
    "the most reliable ones come from the fss analysis of the fisher zero ( first column ) .",
    "the approximate agreement between the obtained values of @xmath4 at all three @xmath22 values demonstrates that the confinement - coulomb critical line belongs to one universality class .",
    "the fss behavior of @xmath48 according to ( [ imz ] ) , and the consistency of this behavior at different @xmath22 are illustrated in fig .",
    "the value ( [ nu ] ) has been obtained from a joint fit by means of ( [ imz ] ) to the data for @xmath48 with @xmath49 ( parallel straight lines in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the next two columns in table  1 show the results from the fss analysis of the maximum of the specific - heat @xmath45 and the minimum of the challa - landau - binder cumulant @xmath46 . here",
    "certain assumptions about nonleading terms have been necessary @xcite , and small systematic errors are therefore possible",
    ". nevertheless , all the shown results are consistent with @xmath4 lying in the interval @xmath50 , thus supporting universality .",
    "the physical content of the continuum limit of the pure compact u(1 ) gauge theory at the confinement - coulomb phase transition , discussed e.g. in @xcite , depends on the phase from which the critical line is approached . in the confinement phase , a confining theory with monopole condensate is expected , as the string tension scales with a critical exponent consistent with the value ( [ nu])@xcite .",
    "the physical spectrum consists of various gauge balls . in the coulomb phase , massless photon and massive magnetic monopoles ,",
    "both already observed in monte carlo simulations @xcite , should be present .",
    "the renormalized electric charge @xmath51 is large but finite@xcite , and has presumably a universal value@xcite .",
    "the numerical result @xmath52@xcite agrees with the lscher bound @xcite , as explained in @xcite .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the existence of such continuum quantum field theories in 4d is in no way indicated by the perturbation expansion .",
    "the non - gaussian character of the fixed point might be rather understood as a consequence of the complex dynamics of the systems obtained in the dual representation of the theory with villain action @xcite .",
    "there are some questions deserving further discussion . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the studied theory does not satisfy reflection positivity , which is a sufficient , albeit not necessary condition for unitarity .",
    "if the phase transition in the reflection positive case at @xmath18 is of 2@xmath43 order , as strongly suggested by our results , then unitarity should hold also for @xmath54 by universality arguments . if it is of weak @xmath8 order , unitarity at @xmath54",
    "is made plausible by our finding that the scaling behavior at @xmath18 ( on lattices of limited size ) , and at @xmath54 is the same , and that the regions with @xmath54 and @xmath55 are connected by the rg flows@xcite .",
    "though improbable , it is not completely excluded that the phase transition we have studied is of @xmath8 order for any @xmath56 @xcite , but so weak , that the two - state signal can not be detected by the currently available numerical means . then the correlation length would remain finite for all finite @xmath22 .",
    "presumably , the effective cutoff , arising in this way , may be made arbitrarily large by suitably decreasing @xmath22 .",
    "however , unitarity then might be questionable .    at small @xmath57 , where the order of the transition probably changes , a tricritical point with special values of indices",
    "is expected@xcite . as",
    "the domain of dominance of such a point is unknown , it could be that the measured value of @xmath4 , and the corresponding non - gaussian fixed point are actually tricritical . alternatively , the change of the order might be more complicated than in metamagnets with tricritical points , since in our case only nonlocal order parameters are available .",
    "though this may seem plausible , we can not firmly conclude that the two - state signal observed on toroidal lattices is due to the monopole loops winding around them .",
    "the evidence for such an explanation is controversial @xcite , and the question , which configurations make the difference between the compact u(1 ) gauge theory on finite toroidal and spherical lattices , requires further study .",
    "the thermodynamic limit ought to be the same .",
