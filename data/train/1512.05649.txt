    "relativistic quantum cryptography @xcite is a recent branch of physics - based cryptography in which the combined power of quantum physics and relativity is exploited to guarantee security .",
    "it opens up possibilities for novel cryptographic tasks that do not have analogues in nonrelativistic settings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it motivates the investigation of security for tasks that were shown impossible in nonrelativistic quantum scenarios . for example ,",
    "unconditionally secure protocols for bit commitment @xcite , ideal coin tossing @xcite , strong coin tossing with arbitrarily small bias @xcite , all - or nothing oblivious transfer @xcite , 1-out - of-2 oblivious transfer @xcite , and more general two - party classical computation @xcite have been shown impossible in nonrelativistic quantum settings .",
    "although these impossibility proofs also apply to relativistic quantum settings for must of these tasks @xcite , they do not apply to bit commitment @xcite , and ideal and strong coin tossing @xcite , for which unconditionally secure relativistic protocols have been found @xcite .    here",
    "we introduce a novel cryptographic task in minkowski spacetime , which we motivate with the following problem .",
    "we consider a particular reference frame @xmath7 agreed a priori by alice and bob .",
    "alice has two passwords @xmath8 at the spacetime point @xmath9 , defined in @xmath7 , permitting the access to one of two computers : @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the computer @xmath12 can be accessed if the password @xmath13 is input in the spacetime region @xmath14 , for @xmath15 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are spacelike separated and within the future light cone of @xmath16 .",
    "here we consider that @xmath14 is the intersection of the future light cone of @xmath17 and the set of spacetime points @xmath18 for @xmath19 , defined in the reference frame @xmath7 , where @xmath20 is a small parameter , @xmath21 , the first entry in a four vector is temporal , and we use units in which the speed of light is @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "the password @xmath13 is stored securely in the computer @xmath12 in the past light cone of @xmath23 .",
    "the computer @xmath12 is secure from alice and accepts the password only in the region @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the password @xmath13 is only useful within @xmath14 .",
    "bob pays alice at @xmath16 for one of the passwords .",
    "the deal is that bob can have access to @xmath24 in @xmath4 , that bob can not access @xmath25 in @xmath26 , and that alice should be oblivious to bob s choice @xmath27 , anywhere in spacetime . we define the cryptographic task that complies with the previous conditions as _ spacetime - constrained oblivious transfer _ ( scot ) .",
    "two - dimensional spacetime diagram of the defined cryptographic task , scot , in the reference frame @xmath7 in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the vertical lines correspond to the world lines of alice s and bob s agents .",
    "the small circles represent the spacetime points @xmath9 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the dotted lines represent light rays , defining the future light cones of @xmath16 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the spacetime regions @xmath14 , where the passwords @xmath13 are accepted as valid by the computers @xmath12 , correspond to the filled regions , for @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath33 is the spacetime point within the intersection of the future light cones of @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the smallest time coordinate , @xmath34 , in the frame @xmath7 . ]",
    "scot is a relativistic version of 1-out - of-2 oblivious transfer ( ot ) @xcite .",
    "ot is an important cryptographic task that can be used to implement more sophisticated tasks @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , ot can not be implemented with unconditional security in nonrelativistic , or relativistic , quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "the main argument in the proof of the no - go theorem for ot is that the fact that bob must learn alice s message @xmath24 with probability equal to ( or very close to ) unity and that , in a secure protocol , alice does not have any information ( or has very little information ) about bob s input @xmath1 , implies that there exists a unitary operation that bob can apply to his systems after learning @xmath35 that transforms his systems into a state that allows him to learn @xmath36 with probability equal to ( or very close to ) unity too @xcite .",
    "similar arguments apply in the proofs that unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment and classical deterministic two party computation are impossible @xcite .    we note that these mayers - lo - chau quantum attacks @xcite and more general impossibility proofs @xcite do not apply to scot ,",
    "because , due to minkowski causality , a nonlocal unitary acting on systems in @xmath5 and @xmath37 can not be completed outside the intersection of the future light cones of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , hence , it can not be completed within @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "more generally , these no - go theorems do not apply to _ spacetime - constrained multi - party computation _",
    ", which is defined as an extension of multi - party computation @xcite in which the inputs and outputs are constrained to be input and output within fixed constrained regions of spacetime , respectively , a research problem initially outlined by kent @xcite .",
    "our results are the following .",
    "we show that unconditionally secure scot can not be achieved with classical protocols in minkowski or galilean spacetime , or with quantum protocols in galilean spacetime .",
    "then , after describing the general setting of relativistic quantum cryptography , we give a quantum protocol for scot in minkowski spacetime , and we show it unconditionally secure .",
    "interestingly , to the best of our knowledge , scot is the second cryptographic task with classical inputs and outputs that is proved unconditionally secure with relativistic quantum protocols , but whose unconditional security is known impossible with classical or nonrelativistic quantum protocols , location - oblivious data transfer being the first one @xcite . in particular , there are relativistic classical bit commitment protocols that are provably unconditionally secure for a single round @xcite , that is , for a duration limited by the time that light takes to travel between the labs of the participating agents .",
    "we note that the first security proof for single - round relativistic classical bit commitment protocols was given by kent ( see lemma 3 of ref .",
    "there are conjectured unconditionally secure @xcite relativistic classical bit commitment protocols with multiple rounds , whose duration can be extended arbitrarily long for a fixed distance between the labs of the agents .",
    "these have been shown secure against arbitrary classical attacks @xcite , but remain to be shown secure against arbitrary quantum attacks .",
    "proving arbitrarily long relativistic , classical or quantum , bit commitment protocols unconditionally secure against arbitrary quantum attacks remains as an important open problem .",
    "we consider arbitrary scot protocols taking place in a finite region of spacetime , hence , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 having a finite separation . we show that classical scot protocols of this form can not be unconditionally secure , in minkowski or galilean spacetime .",
    "then we argue that unconditionally secure scot is impossible in a galilean quantum world , as follows from lo s no - go theorem @xcite for nonrelativistic quantum ot .",
    "in general we can consider that alice and bob have several agents who participate in the protocol at different points of spacetime .",
    "in particular , the protocol involves communication events from an agent of alice to an agent of bob or vice versa at various spacetime points . without loss of generality",
    "we reduce the number of communication events to three , occurring at @xmath16 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , where we assume that alice and bob have adjacent labs of negligible extension .",
    "we consider first that spacetime is minkowski and alice and bob perform a classical protocol .",
    "we assume there exists a classical scot protocol that is secure against alice .",
    "we show that this protocol must be insecure against bob .",
    "we give below the main physical arguments of the proof .",
    "some mathematical details of the proof are given in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "let @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 be the sets of possible communication events between alice and bob at the spacetime points @xmath16 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath41 be the probability that the communication event @xmath42 occurs in the honest protocol , in general depending on alice s inputs @xmath43 and on bob s input @xmath1 . since @xmath44 is classical , alice and bob can produce perfect copies of it , use some copies in the protocol and keep others for record .",
    "in particular , alice s agents at @xmath16 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 can send a copy of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 to her agents at the other spacetime points at the speed of light , respectively . since the protocol occurs in a finite region of spacetime",
    ", the copies of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 arrive to all of alice s agents after a finite time .",
    "since we assume that the protocol is secure against alice , for any fixed inputs @xmath43 , alice can guess bob s bit @xmath1 with a bounded probability @xmath48 for some @xmath49 , where the labels  c \" and  a \" denote  cheating alice .",
    "\" we show in appendix [ appa ] that ( [ 1 ] ) implies @xmath50    on the other hand , following the honest protocol with any input @xmath27 , bob s agents must be able to use the obtained value @xmath44 and process it with some extra classical resources @xmath51 in order to output @xmath24 in @xmath4 with some probability @xmath52 for some @xmath53 , where the labels  h \" and  b \" denote  honest bob .",
    "\" bob s agents can prepare and distribute two copies of @xmath51 before the protocol .",
    "bob s agents can produce two perfect copies of the exchanged messages @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . since the communication events @xmath44 occur with probabilities @xmath54 that are very close for different values of @xmath27 , as given by ( [ 2 ] ) , bob s agents can run two simultaneous protocols , one with input @xmath55 and the other one with input @xmath56 and thus output both @xmath35 in @xmath5 and @xmath57 in @xmath6 with probability @xmath58 very close to unity , satisfying @xmath59 as we show in appendix [ appa ] , where the labels  c \" and  b \" denote  cheating bob . \" thus , the scot protocol is insecure against bob , as claimed .",
    "this result trivially holds in galilean spacetime because in this case alice s agents can instantaneously communicate the values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "now we consider arbitrary quantum scot protocols in galilean spacetime . in principle ,",
    "alice s and bob s agents can communicate classical information instantaneously .",
    "they can also transmit quantum states between distant locations instantaneously via quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "thus , we can consider the region of three dimensional space in which the protocol takes places as two big labs adjacent to each other , one controlled by alice and the other one by bob .",
    "the output regions @xmath5 and @xmath6 become irrelevant in this scenario because if bob can output @xmath24 anywhere in his lab then he can output @xmath24 in @xmath4 .",
    "this is the scenario of nonrelativistic quantum 1-out - of-2 oblivious transfer .",
    "therefore , lo s no - go theorem stating that secure ot is impossible in nonrelativistic quantum cryptography applies @xcite .",
    "it follows that secure scot is impossible in a galilean quantum world .",
    "we describe the setting for relativistic quantum cryptography that applies to the protocol we present here @xcite .",
    "alice and bob consist of three different agents , each controlling a secure laboratory .",
    "we denote alice s agents by @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and bob s agents by @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "agents @xmath60 and @xmath63 have secure laboratories at space regions adjacent to the point @xmath66 , while agents @xmath67 and @xmath68 have secure laboratories at space regions adjacent to the points @xmath69 , for @xmath15 . for clarity of the presentation",
    "we assume that alice s and bob s laboratories have negligible extension and are located exactly at @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "we also assume that the processing of classical and quantum information at each laboratory is secure , perfect and instantaneous .",
    "we assume that the transmission of classical or quantum systems between laboratories is free of errors and at the speed of light .",
    "bob has secure and error - free quantum channels between his laboratories .",
    "alice has secure and error - free classical channels between hers .",
    "there are not any losses of the transmitted classical or quantum states .",
    "finally , we require that the spacetime regions @xmath5 and @xmath6 at which bob needs to produce his outputs are secure from alice .",
    "we present an unconditionally secure quantum scot protocol in minkowski spacetime .",
    "alice s input @xmath73 is generated randomly and securely by @xmath60 in the past light cone of @xmath16 , and stored securely in the computer @xmath12 in the past light cone of @xmath23 , for @xmath19 .    in the past light cone of @xmath16",

    "@xmath60 gives @xmath63 the qubits @xmath78 with their labels @xmath85 at @xmath16 .",
    "using her secure classical channels , @xmath60 sends @xmath86 and @xmath87 to @xmath67 , who receives them at @xmath23 , where @xmath88 denotes bitwise sum modulo two .",

    "immediately after receiving the qubits @xmath78 from @xmath60 at @xmath16 , @xmath63 sends them through his secure quantum channel to @xmath90 , in a consecutive order according to their labels @xmath85 . at @xmath91 , for each @xmath80 , @xmath90 measures @xmath78 in the basis @xmath92 , obtaining the bit outcome @xmath93 .",

    "our protocol is clearly secure against alice given our assumptions that bob s laboratories and quantum channels are secure .",
    "we note that bob could easily output @xmath35 in @xmath5 and @xmath57 in @xmath6 , if @xmath5 and @xmath6 were allowed to be timelike separated .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is defined as above , but @xmath6 is allowed to be the intersection of the future light cone of @xmath30 ( see fig .

    "the measurement implemented by @xmath68 at @xmath23 in general depends on @xmath86 but not on @xmath119 , because the state @xmath79 of qubit @xmath78 depends on @xmath125 but not on @xmath126 , the @xmath85th entry of @xmath89 , which is random .",
    "similarly , in general , the goal of this measurement is to output a @xmath127bits string @xmath128 which must equal @xmath100 with high probability because of the encoding @xmath129 .",

    "furthermore , we note that our scot protocol seems quite similar to kent s quantum relativistic bit commitment protocol @xcite , in that in both protocols random bb84 states are transmitted at the spacetime point @xmath16 .",
    "an important difference between our scot protocol and kent s bit commitment protocol @xcite is that in our protocol , at the spacetime point @xmath23 , bob s agent @xmath68 is informed of the bases on which alice prepared the transmitted qubits , while in kent s protocol the committer ( who would be bob in our notation , but is alice in the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite ) is never revealed the bases by the other party .",
    "this implies that the security proofs of kent s protocol @xcite , for example the one by croke and kent @xcite , can not in general be adapted to show the security of our scot protocol , because in a general cheating strategy by bob in our protocol , bob s agents @xmath68 apply measurements that depend on the bases on which alice prepared the qubits , which is not possible in the cheating strategies in the bit commitment protocol @xcite .",
    "the defined task of scot can be generalized to settings in which alice has @xmath106 inputs @xmath157 that bob must output within spacelike separated regions @xmath158 according to his input @xmath159 .",
    "one can also investigate different configurations of the geometry for the output and input regions ( see an example in appendix [ appc ] ) .",
    "additionally , one can relax the condition that alice should not be able to learn bob s input @xmath1 anywhere in spacetime to the weaker requirement that alice should not learn @xmath1 within some fixed particular region of spacetime .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether scot protocols can be proved unconditionally secure from fundamental physical principles in more general models of spacetime or in postquantum theories of correlations .",
    "for example , can we find scot protocols that are provably unconditionally secure from the violation of bell inequalities and the no - signaling principle ( as recently done for relativistic quantum bit commitment protocols @xcite ) ?    finally , it is interesting to investigate whether scot can be combined with other cryptographic tasks to perform more general spacetime - constrained multi - party computation and other sophisticated cryptographic tasks .",

    "a password @xmath186 is accepted as valid by @xmath12 if it differs from @xmath13 in at most @xmath187 bit entries . under this condition , the probability @xmath188 that both @xmath64 and @xmath65 input valid passwords into @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , is bounded by @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the binary entropy .",
    "this bound follows because the probability to win a modified version of the @xmath136 in which a fraction @xmath191 of bit errors is allowed is not greater than @xmath192 @xcite .",
