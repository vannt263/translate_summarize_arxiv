    "dengue fever is a mosquito - borne infectious disease and is re - emerging worldwide and causing larger and more frequent epidemics , especially in cities in the tropics and has become a major international public health concern .",
    "dengue is found in tropical and sub - tropical regions around the world , predominantly in urban and semi - urban areas .",
    "the disease is caused by four distinct , but closely related viruses which are transmitted to humans through the bites of infective female aedes mosquitoes @xcite .",
    "recovery from infection by one provides life long immunity against that virus but confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection by the other three viruses .",
    "there is good evidence that sequential infection increases the risk of developing a more acute form of the disease known as dengue hemorrhagic fever ( dhf ) and dengue shock syndrome ( dss ) which can be fatal .",
    "the mortality rate ranges from 6 to 30 percent , most commonly in children .",
    "the main pathophysiology of dhf and dss is the development of plasma leakage from the capillaries , resulting in haemoconcentration , asciteps , and pleural effusion that may lead to shock following defervescence of fever @xcite .",
    "there is no vaccine yet for df / dhf and management of the cases is largely supportive @xcite .",
    "dengue illness is often confused with other viral febrile states confounding both clinical management ( @xcite ) and disease surveillance for viral transmission prevention @xcite .",
    "these difficulties especially strike during the early phase illness , wherein specific clinical symptoms and signs accompany the febrile illness @xcite .",
    "more definitive symptoms such as retro - orbital pain and rashes do not appear until the later stages of illness .",
    "therefore a definitive early diagnosis requires laboratory tests such as enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) and rt - pcr , which is based on nucleic and acid hybridization ( @xcite ) .",
    "further the places where dengue is endemic lack the necessary infrastructure to carry out these tests @xcite , thus a scheme for reliable clinical diagnosis based on the data that can be obtained routinely , would be useful for early recognition of dengue fever . the current world health organization ( who ) scheme for classifying dengue infection ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ) makes use of symptoms which are not often present in the early stages of the infection , and thus it is not useful for early diagnosis .",
    "the univarite and multivariate statistical techniques can provide a list of symptoms and signs based on clinical and laboratory features that can be associated with dengue ( @xcite ) , but does not throw any light on diagnosis of the disease .",
    "evidence - based triage strategies that identify individuals likely to be in the early stages of dengue illness are needed to be developed to help directing patient stratification for clinical investigations , management , and virological surveillance . to address this concern by utilizing alternating decision tree procedure",
    "@xcite which can generate more accurate , smaller and easier classification rules to interpret , when compared with decision trees such as c4.5 @xcite for diagnosing dengue fever .",
    "the clinical records consist of the following clinical features such as fever duration ( fd ) , vomiting / nausea , body pains , rashes , pulse , headache , restlessness , abdominal pain ) and following laboratory features such as hemoglobin ( hb ) , white blood cells ( wbc ) , platelet ( plt ) , packed cell volume ( pcv ) , immunoglobin m ( igm ) and immunoglobin g ( igg ) .",
    "missing values in the continuous variables are replaced with their mean value ( table .",
    "[ tab : table2 ] ) before subjecting to further analysis .",
    "we refer our readers to @xcite for a more detailed treatment on missing values in databases .",
    "as more than 40% of the clinical records have missing values for the attributes igg and igm , they are excluded from our analysis .",
    ".missing values for continuous attributes in the dataset is replaced with mean value [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     a sensitivity of 89% for a specificity of 52% is achieved using adtree ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] ) with only 65 datasets , without considering the igm and igg antibody attributes , has performed better in comparison to logistic regression approach ( @xcite , sensitivity 90% and specificity 58% for 412 patients ) and c4.5 decision tree approach ( @xcite roc auc 0.82 for 1012 cases ) .",
    "using an alternating decision tree algorithm with boosting for analysis of all clinical and hematological data , we obtained diagnostic rules that discriminates dengue from non - dengue illness with an accuracy of 84% and improved classification of 89% when the attribute pulse is converted into a categorical variable .",
    "the specificity in adtree can be further improved by providing a sufficient number of examples of non - dengue cases .",
    "this study shows a proof - of - concept that alternating decision trees with boosting using simple clinical and laboratory parameters can predict the diagnosis of dengue disease , a finding that could prove useful in disease management and surveillance .",
