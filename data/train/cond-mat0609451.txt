    "the colossal magnetoresistance observed in perovskite manganese oxides has revived the interest in these systems exhibiting a large variety of intriguing phenomena @xcite .",
    "these unusual physical properties arise from the interplay between interactions resulting in a rich electronic phase diagram which exhibits different charge , spin and orbital orderings @xcite . in the perovskite manganites ,",
    "the mn ions are located at the center of mno@xmath3 octahedrons and their @xmath4 levels are splitted in a triplet @xmath5 and a doublet @xmath2 in the cubic crystal field .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath2 electrons are into a high spin state because of a strong hund coupling @xmath6 . in the undoped compounds",
    "lnmno@xmath0 , where ln is a lanthanide ion , the mn ions are trivalent with @xmath7 configuration . the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect , which is very important because of the strong electron phonon coupling , removes the orbital degeneracy of the doublet .",
    "cooperative jt effects occur below @xmath8 ( @xmath9 for prmno@xmath0 @xcite ) yielding both an orbital ordering @xcite and the opening of a gap .",
    "in addition to the orbital ordering , a - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering , corresponding to @xmath10-planes that are ferromagnetic ( fm ) with antiferromagnetic coupling between them , is stabilized below @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for prmno@xmath0 @xcite ) .",
    "such an orbitally ordered a - type af state has been generally explained on the basis of goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules @xcite , which are based on the superexchange interaction .",
    "lamno@xmath0 has been widely studied in recent years . in particular ,",
    "it was found @xcite that the low energy spectrum of the optical conductivity displays a peak at @xmath13 characterized by an increase of its spectral weight at low-@xmath14",
    ". such a @xmath14-dependence was _ qualitatively _ explained in terms of double exchange ( de ) effects on optical transitions @xcite in agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite . in this letter , we investigate the @xmath14-dependence of the optical conductivity of prmno@xmath0 , which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously reported .",
    "we find a behaviour clearly similar to that reported for lamno@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14-dependence of the peak around @xmath13 is a robust feature of this type of coumpound , and results from the fm spin ordering in the @xmath10-planes .",
    "finally , we find _ quantitative _ agreement with the furukawa s double exchange model @xcite extended to two @xmath2 bands splitted by cooperative jt effects .",
    "the samples used in this study are polycrystallines of the stoichiometric compounds prmno@xmath0 and camno@xmath0 .",
    "they were synthesized from an organic gel - assisted citrate process described in @xcite .",
    "reflectivity spectra were measured by using a fourier - transform infrared ( bruker ifs 66v / s ) spectrometer over the energy range @xmath15 to @xmath16 . in the @xmath14 range @xmath17 to @xmath18 ,",
    "the measurements were carried out by using a he - cryostat with optical windows .",
    "the samples were polished up to optical grade ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "after the initial measurements , the samples were coated with a silver film and measured again .",
    "these additional data were used as reference mirrors with the purpose of taking into account of light scattering on the surface of samples . the complex dielectric function and the optical conductivity",
    "were obtained by applying kramers - kr@xmath20nig transformation ( kk ) . to perform kk ,",
    "the reflectance data were extrapolated at high energy using a lorentz oscillator around @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements were performed on a bruker ( emx 6/1 ) spectrometer operating in the x - band ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "= 9 cm @xmath23    figure [ conduc : fig ] shows the real part of the optical conductivity , @xmath24 , of prmno@xmath0 at different temperatures . below @xmath25 , we observe severals peaks that correspond to the phononic contribution .",
    "an optical gap goes up to the onset ( @xmath26 ) of a peak at @xmath27 , which is characterized by three main features : @xmath28 a @xmath14-dependence , @xmath29 a clear correlation with the magnetic ordering ( its height grows between @xmath30 and @xmath31 as much as between @xmath11 and @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 a large width ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "several optical excitations may be considered to understand the origin of this peak : a crystal field ( cf ) transition ( @xmath34 ) , a charge transfert transition ( ct ) ( @xmath35 ) or a jt transition ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "a cf transition costs the energy @xmath37 when exciting an electron whose spin is parallel to the spin of the site or @xmath38 when the spins are antiparallel , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are respectively the energy difference between @xmath5 and @xmath41 levels , and between @xmath41 and @xmath42 levels . according to ab initio calculations on lamno@xmath43 @xcite , one expects @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that such a cf transition is over our experimental window .",
    "on the other hand , ct for an electron from @xmath47 to @xmath42 or from @xmath47 to @xmath41 respectively costs @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the second transition costs more energy than the first one , because @xmath50 .",
    "ab initio calculations @xcite lead to @xmath51 , so we believe that such a transition is not visible in our experimental window . moreover , ct transition does not depend on the magnetic order , and hence , it should not vary with @xmath14 ( especially at @xmath52 ) .",
    "an estimation of @xmath40 obtained from ab initio calculations @xcite is consistent with a @xmath13 peak in @xmath53 .",
    "the effect of the magnetization on the transition depends on the approach ( site or bands ) .",
    "it is unaffected within a site approach @xcite , whereas , in a band picture , ahn and millis @xcite have shown that the part of the spectrum of @xmath53 related to the jt excitation increases at the transition from the paramagnetic state to the a - type af state , due to the fm spin ordering in the @xmath10-planes . in lamno@xmath0 , quijada et al .",
    "@xcite and kim et al .",
    "@xcite have observed such an increase of the @xmath13 feature , below @xmath52 .    in contrary to prmno@xmath0 ,",
    "the mn ions in camno@xmath0 are tetravalent with @xmath54 configuration .",
    "no orbital degeneracy exists , and hence , jt effect does not appear .",
    "therefore , the lowest optical interband transition should be either ct - type or cf - type . in both cases",
    "no @xmath14-dependence is expected @xcite .",
    "this agrees with experimental results found for camno@xmath0 , as shown in the insert of fig.[conduc : fig ] .",
    "moreover , it has been shown from ab initio calculations on lamno@xmath0 @xcite that the gap between the jt splitted bands is indirect .",
    "we will now show that the @xmath13 feature observed in the optical conductivity spectrum of prmno@xmath0 exhibits the typical optical properties of an indirect gap ( phonon assisted transition ) .",
    "this last fact reinforces the hypothesis of an interband jt transition , which will be assumed in the following .",
    "= 14.4 cm @xmath55    in order to follow the gap evolution , we study the @xmath14-dependence of the imaginary part of the dielectric function , @xmath56 , at fixed energy in the vicinity of the gap [ _ cf . _",
    "fig.[gap : fig]a ] .",
    "it should be noted that the bidimensional ( 2d ) ferromagnetism may mask the phenomena of weak strength at low-@xmath14 and above @xmath11 where magnetic fluctuations exist , and hence , an indirect gap should be more easy observable at sufficient high-@xmath14 if some phonon assisted optical excitations do exist .",
    "if one considers that a single phonon mode participates in the combined electron - radiation and electron - phonon interactions , @xmath57 is given by ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath58 \\label{gap_indirect : eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in eq.([gap_indirect : eq ] ) , the first and the second terms respectively characterize the light absorption process involving the absorption and the emission of phonons of energy @xmath59 whose average number is given by the bose - einstein distribution function @xmath60 - 1)$ ] , where the chemical potential is zero .",
    "we see that the threshold for indirect transition is at @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the gap energy .",
    "note that the @xmath14-dependence of the two components arises from @xmath63 since @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which respectively represent the matrix elements of the electron - radiation - phonon interaction for the phonon absorption process and for the phonon emission process , are independent of @xmath14 .    in fig.[gap : fig]a , we plot @xmath56 as a function of @xmath14 at @xmath66 kept constant .",
    "there seems to be no doubt that the @xmath14-dependence of @xmath56 at high-@xmath14 is governed by @xmath63 , as may be seen in fig.[gap : fig]a where the lines display a fit of @xmath67 to the data .",
    "the only free parameters are @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . according to eq.([gap_indirect : eq ] ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are respectively related to @xmath71 , and to @xmath72 .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath73 , which is a realistic phonon energy corresponding to stretching vibration modes of the mno@xmath74 octahedron .",
    "the @xmath66-dependence of the two other fitting parameters are shown in fig.[gap : fig]b , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are plotted as a function of @xmath77 . in both cases , we obtain a linear law which means that @xmath64 and @xmath65 display only a small @xmath66-dependence in the vicinity of the band gap .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath78 .",
    "= 9 cm @xmath79    we shall now pass on a quantitative investigation of the @xmath13 feature at low-@xmath14 .",
    "hereafter , we define the integrated spectral weight of the electronic contribution of @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath80 where we neglect the area below @xmath25 because it originates essentially from phononic contributions .",
    "solide circles in fig.[sw_prmno3 ] display the @xmath14-dependence of @xmath81 .",
    "we see that @xmath81 increases as @xmath14 decreases , exhibiting a variation rate larger at @xmath82 than at @xmath83 . such @xmath14-dependent changes in @xmath81 have already been observed in lamno@xmath0 , and have qualitatively been explained in terms of de picture @xcite . according to this view , we succeed in interpreting quantitatively the results presented here by making an extension of recent theoretical findings obtained for de systems @xcite .",
    "furukawa has calculated the density of state ( dos ) at finite @xmath14 of the ( one - orbital ) de model using non - perturbative approaches @xcite .",
    "he found that the dos is characterized by a two - peak structure ( reflecting the two subband structure @xmath84 and @xmath85 at @xmath86 due to strong fm hund coupling @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the one - electron bandwidth of the @xmath2 band ) whose @xmath14-dependence is determined by the magnetization through @xmath89 [ @xmath90 for the up [ down ] spin electrons in the lower spin subband @xmath91 [ @xmath92 and for the down [ up ] spin electrons in the upper spin subband @xmath93 [ @xmath94 .",
    "so , the lower subband @xmath85 and the upper subband @xmath84 are completely symmetric in the paramagnetic state ( @xmath95 ) , while @xmath91 and @xmath93 [ @xmath96 and @xmath94 become majority [ minority ] spin bands below the curie temperature .",
    "finally , perfect spin polarization appears at the fm ground state ( @xmath97 ) in which @xmath85 is only occupied by electrons with up spin ( parallel to @xmath98 ) , whereas down spin states only exist in @xmath99 .",
    "we extend these results by considering the two active @xmath2 orbitals for large electron jt phonon coupling @xmath100 . within the framework of this approximation",
    ", one expects that the dos is split into four parts , which reflect for @xmath101 two lower subbands @xmath102 and @xmath103 at @xmath104 and two upper subbands @xmath105 and @xmath106 at @xmath107 .",
    "hereafter , we confine ourselves only to @xmath102 and @xmath103 . their dos is proportional to @xmath108 for electrons with up ( down ) spin . according to the fermi golden rule",
    ", the optical transition rate of @xmath109 should be proportional to the product of the dos for the initial state by the dos for the final state .",
    "so , taking into consideration the only allowed interband excitations @xmath110 and @xmath111 in accordance with standard selection rule forbidding optical transitions between states with opposite spins , we obtain that @xmath81 should be proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , such an evaluation of @xmath81 holds solely for @xmath113 originating from intraplanar electronic excitations , since the magnetic stucture of prmno@xmath0 consists of fm @xmath10-planes coupled antiferromagnetically between them .",
    "the @xmath114-axis contributions to @xmath81 would have to come from optical transitions from initial states lying within majority ( minority ) spin subband @xmath115 to final states lying within minority ( majority ) spin subband @xmath116 .",
    "it follows that such interplanar electronic processes should result in a spectral weight @xmath117 proportional to @xmath118 , where @xmath98 is henceforth the reduced magnetization within the @xmath10-planes .",
    "we see that @xmath117 decreases as @xmath98 is increased below @xmath52 , and vanishes at the ground af state .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the spin polarization effect which tends to cancel out the probability of interplanar electronic excitations .",
    "we thus obtain that the total spectral weight @xmath81 should be given by : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the spectral weight at high-@xmath14 ( @xmath95 ) , and @xmath121 and @xmath122 are weighted factors such that @xmath123 . for a system of cubic symetry ,",
    "one expects @xmath124 .    using the measurements of @xmath125 published in @xcite ,",
    "we have fitted the eq.([total_s : eq ] ) to the data .",
    "note that there exits only two independent fitting parameters , as may be seen by rewritting the above formula in the form @xmath126 where @xmath127 is related to @xmath128 . in fig.[sw_prmno3",
    "] , the solid squares display the best fit , whence we obtain @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "these values are consistent with the expected orthorhombic structure ( @xmath131 space group ) which originates from the ideal cubic structure due to cooperative jt effects occuring below @xmath132 @xcite .    a difference may be noted between the predictions of the model and the observed spectral weight @xmath133 for @xmath83 up to @xmath134 .",
    "such a discrepancy between @xmath133 and the spectral weight calculated from eq.([total_s : eq ] ) [ _ cf . _",
    "insert of fig.[sw_prmno3 ] ] can be understood in terms of an excess of spectral weight , @xmath135 , due to fm fluctuations , as it will be seen below .",
    "= 14.4 cm @xmath136    we have measured esr absorption spectra at @xmath137 .",
    "an important difference may be noted between the spectra recorded above @xmath138 and those obtained below @xmath138 . in the @xmath14 range @xmath138 to @xmath18",
    ", we observe a single absorption peak , centered around a resonance field @xmath139 , implying a land factor @xmath140 characteristic of the paramagnetic ( insulating ) phase , whereas , below @xmath138 , a two - feature - like structure appears on either side of the central peak , which remains centered around @xmath141 .",
    "it may be seen from fig.[esr : fig]a , where the ordinate axis represents the derivative of absorption with respect to magnetic field , that the low - field feature moves towards lower field values as @xmath14 decreases , while the higher - field feature shifts towards higher field values .",
    "such a behaviour of esr spectra may be explained by the appearance of ferromagnetically ordered regions in the sample below @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "a possible cause of this weak ferromagnetism is the existence of 2d fm fluctuations due to the orbital ordering .",
    "such a scenario is in agreement with observations reported in lamno@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the integral of the absorption over the magnetic field range studied , which is proportional to the spin susceptibility @xmath142 , follows a curie - weiss law @xmath143 with @xmath144 in the @xmath14 range @xmath138 to @xmath18 , while an important enhancement of @xmath142 occurs below @xmath145 due to fm fluctuations , as shown in fig.[esr : fig]b . from these results",
    ", we may notice the correlation between the evolution with @xmath14 of the difference @xmath146 and the one of the excess of spectral weight , @xmath147 , shown in the insert of fig.[sw_prmno3 ] .",
    "this indicates that the 2d fm fluctuations are good candidates to understand the origin of @xmath147",
    "we have investigated the evolution with @xmath14 of the optical conductivity spectrum for a polycrystalline of prmno@xmath43 . we have observed a single optical excitation around @xmath27 , that we interpret by considering an indirect interband transition between the two lower subbands arising from the splitting of @xmath2 states due to both strong fm exchange coupling and large electron jt phonon coupling .",
    "the @xmath14-dependence of the spectral weight of the transition is quantitatively explained by eq.([total_s : eq ] ) , that we have established from an extension of recent theoretical results obtained for de ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "these results leads us to propose that the de interaction plays an important role not only in the metallic ferromagnetic state of hole - doped manganites but also in prmno@xmath43 , which is an insulator a - type antiferromagnet at low-@xmath14 .",
