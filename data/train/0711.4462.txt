    "the neutron - poor radioactive projectiles @xmath2sn and @xmath1la were produced at the fragment separator frs by fragmentation of a primary beam of @xmath8nd and delivered to the aladin experiment .",
    "the results presented in the following , after a brief discussion of global observables , will be restricted to quantities deduced from the measured yields of resolved isotopes .",
    "they will , in particular , include isoscaling and its relation to the properties of hot fragments at the low - density freeze - out , as well as chemical temperatures deduced from double ratios of isotopic yields and the consequences for the limiting - temperature concept in multifragmentation .",

    "this , however , is suggested by the @xmath14 scaling of fragmentation observables if a comparison of sources of different mass but equal excitation is intended to be made.@xcite",
    "it is one of the basic assumptions of isotopic reaction studies that the mechanism as such remains unchanged and that effects related to the asymmetry dependence of the nuclear forces can be isolated by changing nothing but the isotopic composition of the system .",
    "this view is supported by the observed invariance of the chemical breakup temperatures , here for the case of spectator fragmentation .",
    "the interpretation of the breakup temperatures as a manifestation of the limiting temperatures predicted by the hartree - fock model,@xcite on the other hand , is not equally supported .",
    "this interpretation was derived from the @xmath14 dependence of the temperature which suggested a mass dependence because of the changing mass of the spectator system.@xcite later on , the predicted mass dependence was found to be confirmed in a compilation of chemical break - up temperatures from several experiments,@xcite including the earlier aladin data , which led to their use as a general reference for testing predictions of nuclear stability with respect to temperature ( see ref.@xcite for references ) .",
    "the new data for the @xmath80 region and their comparison with @xmath7au fragmentations suggest that the observed variation with decreasing @xmath14 is more related to the increasing excitation energy than to the decreasing mass of the produced spectator system .",
    "breakup temperatures fairly independent of the isotopic composition or mass of the system are , e.g. , predicted by the statistical fragmentation models which are based on the concept of a phase - space driven instability.@xcite    the discussion of the isoscaling results has focussed on mainly three topics , among them primarily the effects of sequential decay for the isoscaling parameters and for the symmetry term , as well as the role of the surface term in the symmetry energy .",
    "surface terms gain in importance as the mean mass of the produced fragments decreases in multi - fragment decays .",
    "thirdly , also a possible modification of the source @xmath0 due to preequilibrium emissions prior to breakup will affect and most probably reduce the isoscaling parameters .",
    "so far , however , none of these mechanisms has been identified as providing an obvious explanation for the large drop that is observed .",
    "calculations with the microcanonical markov - chain version of the smm,@xcite even show that sequential decay will cause the isoscaling coefficients to increase if the symmetry term governing the mass distributions of the hot fragments is reduced.@xcite transport models predict that the isotopic composition at breakup should not deviate by more than a few percent from the original value.@xcite new experimental results , furthermore , indicate that the isotopic dependence of the surface term is reduced , with respect to that needed to describe ground - state masses , as the excitation of the system increases.@xcite this is also expected theoretically.@xcite    a decrease of the isoscaling parameter @xmath53 with increasing violence of the collision , beyond that expected from the simultaneous increase of the temperature , has also been observed for reactions at intermediate energy ( refs.@xcite and references therein ) and a systematics is emerging .",
    "a very recent interpretation of these results arrives at the conclusion that the reduced density , rather than the elevated temperature , causes the symmetry term to be smaller than the standard value.@xcite this analysis uses a temperature independent potential part of the symmetry term and a kinetic part in the form of a fermi gas , and it is argued that the isoscaling phenomenon itself is evidence for the fact that properties of the considered homogeneous nuclear matter are observable in fragmentation reactions .    in the statistical multifragmentation",
    "model,@xcite normal - density fragments statistically distributed within an expanded volume are considered . here",
    "a reduction of the symmetry term in their liquid - drop description can be imagined to be caused by fragment modifications in the hot environment , including deformations or the effects of nuclear interactions between them .",
    "the neglect of such effects in the actual codes should probably be regarded as an idealization as the assumption of equilibrium at the final freeze - out stage requires nuclear interactions in order to achieve it .",
    "the consequences of a reduced symmetry term for predicted global fragment observables , as e.g. multiplicity , are rather small for this class of models .",
    "the partitioning is predominantly driven by the surface term in the fragment description while a variation of the symmetry term affects mainly the isotopic distributions.@xcite    further studies will be needed in order to put some of the assumptions on a firmer basis and to quantitatively establish the reduction of the symmetry term in multi - fragment breakups .",
    "the sequential decay corrections are obviously important but also the evolution of the isotopic compositions during the reaction process deserves attention .",
