    "charm pair production in two - photon processes at @xmath1=58 gev have been reported in references @xcite .",
    "all of these papers have reported larger cross sections than that based on the lowest - order ( lo ) two - photon theory @xcite , when the drees - grassie parametrization @xcite in the resolved - photon processes was taken into account . in our previous reports @xcite we showed that the charm - pair cross sections approximately agreed with theory when we took into account the next - to - leading - order correction ( nlo ) to the hard interactions @xcite , the lower charm - quark mass , and the intrinsic gluon @xmath15 inside a photon @xcite , together with the levy - abramowicz - charchula set-1 ( lac1 ) parametrization @xcite for the resolved - photon process .",
    "this explanation of excesses , however , must be confirmed by further analysis .    in this article",
    "we present an analysis of inclusive @xmath0 production in the two - photon reaction using data taken with the topaz detector at tristan .",
    "as was demonstrated in our @xmath16 analysis @xcite , strange particles enhance the charm fraction in a sample .",
    "this analysis is , thus , expected to provide another handle for checking the above - mentioned theoretical arguments .",
    "moreover , since @xmath0 is , being a strange baryon , favorably produced from gluon jets @xcite , we expect to observe the nlo effects directly by measuring the inclusive @xmath3 production rates .",
    "in addition , the technique used to tag a remnant - jet using a forward calorimeter @xcite , which was developed in the @xmath16 analysis @xcite , can also be applied in this analysis .",
    "we have thus derived inclusive @xmath0 cross sections for both direct and resolved - photon processes separately .",
    "the data used in this analysis were obtained with the topaz detector at the tristan @xmath17 collider , kek@xcite .",
    "the mean @xmath1 was 58 gev and the integrated luminosity was 265 pb@xmath2 .",
    "a forward calorimeter ( fcl ) , which covered @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the polar angle , i.e. , the angle with respect to the electron beam ) , was installed during the course of the experiment .",
    "the fcl was made of bismuth germanate crystals ( bgo ) , and was used to anti - tag the beam electrons ( positrons ) and to tag hadrons ( remnant - jets ) @xcite .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the data with the fcl detector was 241 pb@xmath2 .",
    "a description of our trigger system can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the requirement for the charged - track trigger was two or more tracks with an opening angle greater than 45 - 90 degrees .",
    "the @xmath15 threshold for charged particles was 0.3 - 0.7 gev , which varied depending on the beam conditions .",
    "the event - selection criteria were as follows : there had to be three or more charged particles ( @xmath20 gev , @xmath210.77 ) , the invariant mass ( @xmath22 ) of visible particles ( @xmath210.77 ) had to be greater than 2 gev , the event - vertex position had to be consistent with the interaction point , and the visible energy had to be less than 25 gev . in total ,",
    "280673 events were selected .",
    "in order to estimate the acceptances and backgrounds in this analysis , we used the following monte - carlo simulation programs .",
    "details concerning the event generation of direct as well as resolved - photon and vector meson dominance ( vdm ) processes can be found in references @xcite . here",
    ", we just note the following points . for @xmath23 generation",
    ", we used the current charm - quark mass of 1.3 gev to calculate the cross sections for point - like processes and a constituent charm - quark mass of 1.6 gev for the hadronization procedure , and made a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) correction by factorization , the details of which can be found in references @xcite .",
    "light - quark generation was carried out by using the lowest order ( lo ) formula with a @xmath24 cut of 2.5 gev .",
    "we used the parton density functions by lac1 @xcite for the resolved - photon process , because the experimental data have favored this parametrization @xcite .",
    "jetset6.3 @xcite was used for hadroniztion of parton system . here",
    ", we must mention that we used the default values for the baryon production parameters , such as a @xmath25 ratio of 0.10 and a @xmath26 ratio of 0.5 .",
    "generated events were processed through the standard topaz detector simulation program @xcite , in which hadron showers were simulated with an extended version of gheisha 7 @xcite . the simulation s handling of hadronic interactions with nuclei has been updated to fit various experimental cross sections .    using the above - mentioned monte - carlo simulations , the trigger efficiency for the sum of the direct and resolved - photon processes",
    "was estimated to be 79% , 97% of which represented charged trigger events .",
    "the event - selection efficiency after the trigger was obtained to be 80% . to generate single - photon - exchange hadronic events we used jetset6.3@xcite with the parameter values given in reference @xcite .",
    "the tagging conditions were as follows . for anti - electron tagging there had to be no energy deposit of more than 0.4@xmath27 in @xmath28 ( anti - electron tag or anti - tag ) , where @xmath27 is the beam energy .",
    "the rejected sample was called the electron tag sample .",
    "these selected events were from collisions of almost - real photons , for which the equivalent photon approximation was expected to be accurate at the 1% level . when the energy cut was lowered , the number of mistakenly rejected beam remnant hadron ( remnant - jets ) events became significant , as predicted by monte - carlo simulations .",
    "this implies the possibility of tagging the resolved - photon process by requiring , for instance , 500 mev @xmath29 0.25@xmath27 , where @xmath30 is the energy deposit in the fcl ( remnant - jet tag or rem - tag ) . the yield of the remnant - jet tag events agreed with our monte - carlo simulation within 5% @xcite .",
    "an event selection without these two tags is hereafter called , a  no - electron tag \" or a  no - tag \" .",
    "also , data without using the fcl detector were included in this sample .",
    "the fractions of anti - electron and remnant - jet tag events to no - tag events were obtained to be 97.6 and 47% , respectively . in the monte - carlo simulations we used the equivalent photon approximation with the photon flux expression @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 we set the @xmath33 limit at the smaller of @xmath34 and the anti - tag limit [ @xmath35 , where @xmath36 degrees ] , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the transverse momentum and the mass of a quark , respectively @xcite .",
    "the tagging efficiency of the remnant jet for the resolved - photon process was estimated to be @xmath39% , taking into account an estimate of the fcl noise ( described later ) .",
    "we tried to generate remnant partons using two techniques : one was along the beam direction ; the other used a gaussian distribution of the @xmath15-width ( 0.44 gev ) with respect to the beam axis .",
    "these two methods differed in acceptance by only 1% .",
    "further , the tagging efficiency of the remnant - jet tag for the direct process was estimated to be @xmath40% with the estimated level of fcl noise .",
    "the charged - track selection criteria for the @xmath0 analysis were as follows : for each track @xmath15 had to be greater than 0.15 gev , @xmath41 had to be less than 0.77 , and the closest approach to the interaction point in the xy - plane ( perpendicular to the beam axis ) had to be greater than 0.5 cm .",
    "using these selected tracks , we looked for opposite - sign pairs with an opening angle of less than 90 degrees , and carried out secondary vertex reconstructions three - dimensionally . here , the de / dx of one of two tracks had to be consistent with the proton assumption ( @xmath42 ) , and that of the other had to be consistent with the pion assumption ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we demanded that these pairs be consistent with the assumption that they came from event vertices with flight lengths greater than 3 cm .",
    "finally , we rejected pairs which had vertices near ( @xmath443 cm ) to the inner pressure vessel ( @xmath4530 cm ) or the field cage ( @xmath4533 cm ) of the tpc @xcite in order to reduce the background from nuclear interactions ; by generating events without any @xmath3 s , we found that there were no significant contribution from such fake pairs after this cut .",
    "we also required that @xmath46 of the pair had to be less than 0.77 .",
    "the invariant - mass distributions of these candidate @xmath47 pairs and their charge - conjugated states ( cc ) are plotted in figure [ mass ] for the three tagging conditions , respectively .",
    "-2 cm -1 cm    these invariant - mass spectra were fitted with the sum of a fifth - order polynomial and a gaussian distribution , and the peak entries were obtained for no- , anti- , and remnant - jet tags to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 @xmath0 s , respectively , in the @xmath15 range between 0.75 - 2.75 gev .",
    "the peak position and the width were consistent with the detector simulation . among them , 2-@xmath51 , 0-@xmath52 , and 0-@xmath53 pairs were found .",
    "in order to derive the differential @xmath15 cross sections we divided @xmath15 into four bins , as shown in table [ tcross ] .    .",
    "differential cross section of @xmath0 versus @xmath15 ( gev ) [ @xmath54 ( pb / gev ) ] , for @xmath55 .",
    "six cases are listed : no - tag , anti - electron tag , remnant - jet tag with vdm subtraction , anti - remnant - jet tag without vdm subtraction , and remnant - jet tag without vdm subtraction , which are described in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to extract the nlo effect , we calculated the lo cross sections , which are also shown in table [ ttotal ] . here , we removed the nlo factorization from our monte - carlo generator .",
    "the ratio between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data are typically @xmath562 .",
    "we carried out an inclusive measurement of @xmath0 productions in two - photon processes at tristan .",
    "the mean @xmath1 was 58 gev and the integrated luminosity was 265 pb@xmath2 .",
    "inclusive @xmath3 cross sections in two - photon processes were obtained under such conditions as no - electron , anti - electron , and remnant - jet tags . in particular , using the remnant - jet tagging we could unambiguously extract the contribution from the resolved - photon process .",
    "comparisons with theoretical predictions were carried out .",
    "the cross sections were two - times larger than the theoretical predictions without hard gluon emissions , suggesting the necessity of next - to - leading - order monte - carlo generator .",
    "we thank drs . k. hagiwara and t. sjstrand for helpful discussion concerning the baryon production mechanism .",
    "we also thank the tristan accelerator staff for the successful operation of tristan .",
