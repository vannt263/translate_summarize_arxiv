    "since the first observation of an isolated muon event with large missing transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) and a high @xmath2 jet @xcite by the h1 experiment , this `` isolated lepton '' event class has been the subject of many studies performed at hera @xcite .",
    "the main sm process with a charged lepton , a jet and a neutrino ( @xmath1 ) in the final state is the production of w  bosons which decay leptonically . for large transverse momenta of the hadronic final state , @xmath3  gev , six events ( 1e + 5@xmath4 ) were observed for an expectation of 3.2 @xcite in the analysis of the 36.5  pb@xmath5 of @xmath6 data taken from 1994 - 97 .",
    "recently , the full hera  i data set has been analysed @xcite combining @xmath6 data and @xmath7 data with a total integrated luminosity which is 118.3  pb@xmath5 . with an improved sm background suppression , 10 events were observed to be compared to 2.9 expected , confirming the excess . a similar analysis performed by the zeus collaboration @xcite does not confirm the excess ; their data were found to be in agreement with the sm .",
    "however , in a recent analysis of the @xmath8 channel 2 events were seen to be compared to 0.12 expected @xcite .",
    "the isolated lepton event class was discussed as a possible signal for the anomalous production of single top quarks at hera @xcite with subsequent semileptonic decay : @xmath9 .",
    "the sm expectation for single top quark production at hera is of the order of @xmath10  fb and is negligible .",
    "therefore single top production at hera provides an excellent testing ground for the search for fcnc processes beyond the sm .",
    "these processes are predicted for instance by supersymmetric models , dynamical ewsb , extended higgs sectors or other additional symmetries .    in this",
    "talk a search for the single production of top",
    "quarks performed at the h1 experiment is presented .",
    "the search here presented @xcite is based on the selection of isolated lepton events @xcite .",
    "the main preselection cuts are : a minimum transverse momentum of the electron or muon @xmath11  gev , a missing neutrino @xmath12  gev , a high @xmath3  gev hadronic final state , acoplanarity between the lepton and the hadronic final state and the isolation of the lepton from jets in the event @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , specific selection criteria to enrich the single top signature are applied : the b - jet has to have a minimum @xmath2 of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 )  gev in the central ( forward ) part of the detector ; the transverse mass of the lepton - neutrino system @xmath16 has to exceed @xmath17  gev and the reconstructed charge of the top quark has to be positive , as hera is mainly sensitive to the fcnc transition @xmath18 .",
    "the top selection efficiency was simulated using the anotop generator , see @xcite and references therein , and found to be 37% for the electron channel and 45% for the muon channel .",
    "after this selection , h1 sees @xmath19 events for @xmath20 expected . by applying a @xmath21 mass constraint ,",
    "the top candidate mass can be calculated after reconstructing the neutrino kinematics . for each event up to two solutions are possible .",
    "all calculated masses are compatible with the expected top mass distribution .",
    "hadronic top candidates are searched for in the three jet final state topology .",
    "the three jets are ordered in @xmath22 and are required to have more than @xmath23 , @xmath14 , @xmath24  gev , respectively . only jets in the central and forward part of the detector , @xmath25 , are considered , with @xmath26 being the pseudorapidity .",
    "the total transverse energy has to fulfill @xmath27  gev and events with identified electrons are rejected to suppress background from nc deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the top decay is then reconstructed to further suppress the sm background .",
    "the two jets originating from the @xmath21 decay are selected by choosing that jet pairing for which the invariant mass @xmath28 is closest to the nominal @xmath21  mass .",
    "this prescription gives the correct pairing in @xmath29 of the events .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath21 mass is then required to be compatible with the real mass : @xmath30 . to further suppress qcd background , the opening angle @xmath31 of the two @xmath21  jets reconstructed in the top rest frame has to fulfill @xmath32 ( acolinearity ) and the top mass reconstructed from all three jets has to fulfill @xmath33  gev .",
    "the top selection efficiency after all cuts is 27% . in total 14 candidate events",
    "are found for a sm expectation of @xmath34 .",
    "the systematic error of about @xmath35 is largely dominated by a @xmath36 uncertainty on the qcd background prediction .",
    "in the leptonic top decay a slight excess of events is observed whereas in the hadronic channel a slight deficit is seen . by combining both channels a limit at the 95% confidence level on the top cross section of @xmath37  pb",
    "is obtained for a cms energy of 320  gev . here a branching ratio of @xmath38 is assumed .",
    "the hadronic channel alone gives @xmath39  pb , which is better than the combination due to the excess in the lepton channel . the combined limit can be directly converted into a limit on the fcnc anomalous magnetic coupling of the top quark to a @xmath40-quark and a photon : @xmath41 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "this limit includes nlo corrections for both the top signal @xcite and the sm @xmath21 background cross section @xcite .",
    "similar results were also obtained by the zeus collaboration @xcite .",
    "these are slightly more constraining than those obtained by h1 due to the absence of the excess in the leptonic channel .",
    "a comparison of all experimental limits is shown in fig .  [ ano_results ] .",
    "this shows also limits obtained at lep from a search for single top production and limits from the tevatron from the study of radiative top decays .",
    "the figure shows that hera has an unique discovery potential for an anomalous magnetic coupling of the top quark in a parameter space not excluded by other experiments .",
    "motivated by the excess of events seen in the isolated lepton topology the h1 experiment has studied the anomalous production of top quarks .",
    "the interpretation that single top production contributes to the isolated lepton events is not excluded by the results obtained in the hadronic channel , which suffers from large systematic errors .",
    "therefore , higher order qcd calculations are vital to improve the top sensitivity in this channel .",
    "hera has a unique discovery potential for anomalous top quark production .",
    "a further improvement of the sensitivity is expected with the startup of hera  ii , which will deliver higher luminosities and larger event samples in the coming years .",
