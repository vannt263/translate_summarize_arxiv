    "one of the most attractive things about lensed quasars is the possibility of measuring the distance scale without any local calibrators .",
    "if the source is variable and the variation is observed in different images with time delays then a formula of the type @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the lens redshift ) applies .",
    "this formula depends weakly on the source redshift ( the time delay gets somewhat shorter if the source is not very much further than the lens ) and on cosmology ( for the same @xmath3 an einstein - de sitter cosmology gives long time delays , an open universe gives short time delays , with the currently favored flat @xmath4-cosmology being intermediate ) ; but these dependencies are at the 10% level or less .",
    "the troublesome term is the lens - profile dependent factor , which is of order unity but for a given lens can be uncertain by a factor of two or more .",
    "so while the basic theory is well established @xcite , measuring @xmath3 from lensing is still problematic .",
    "meanwhile the search for well - constrained lenses continues , and lensed - quasar aficionados speak of them as `` golden lenses '' @xcite .    in this paper , we study a particularly interesting lens : b1422 + 231 was discovered in the jvas survey @xcite and consists of four images of a quasar at @xmath5 lensed by an elliptical galaxy at @xmath6 @xcite with several nearby galaxies at the same redshift @xcite .",
    "it is especially interesting for four reasons .",
    "first , while external shear from other group galaxies is important in most four - image lenses , unlike other well - studied quads , b1422 is _ dominated _ by external shear .",
    "second , the lensing - galaxy group can be detected directly from its x - ray emission .",
    "third , vlbi imaging of the quasar core @xcite gives information on not just the flux ratios but on the tensor magnification ratios . and",
    "fourth , a time delay between two images has been reported @xcite .

    "the quad has three images with @xmath25 to @xmath26 nearly in a straight line , and a fourth image with @xmath27 on the other side of the galaxy ( see fig .",
    "[ schem ] ) .",
    "the maximum image separation is @xmath28 . examining the image configuration and following the ideas of @xcite on classification of images",
    ", we can work out some basic properties of the system .",
    "first , although time delays are very uncertain , and predictions are model - dependent , the _ ordering _ of arrival times is easily inferable from the image positions and is model - independent .",
    "thus the images can be labeled 1,2,3,4 , by increasing light - travel time .",
    "figure  [ schem ] does so .",
    "we will refer to individual images by these time - order labels .",
    "second , the image configuration is noticeably elongated along ne / sw .",
    "such elongation generically indicates @xcite that the lensing potential is significantly elongated along nw / se . since the main lensing galaxy is an elliptical , and can not generate so much shear by itself , we must immediately suspect a large external shear .      apart from qualitative evidence from the morphology , the importance of external shear in this case is further supported by the observations of galaxy group members , and a comparison with the pg1115 group .",
    "the two groups are rather similar ( see kundi et al .",
    "1997 for comparison ) including number of galaxies in the group , and the distance of the main lensing galaxy from the group s center , about @xmath29 .",
    "but the apparent magnitude , and presumably the associated mass of @xmath30 in b1422 compared to magnitudes ( and masses ) of most of the other group members is small ( @xmath31 vs. @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , whereas in pg1115 , @xmath30 is comparable in brightness to other group members ( @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "we conclude that external shear is more important in b1422 than in pg1115 , and most other 4-image cases .",
    "we can roughly estimate the magnitude of the shear . for a group or a cluster ,",
    "the angular radius of the einstein ring is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "the external shear due to this cluster ( modeled as an isothermal sphere ) is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the distance of the group center from the main lensing galaxy . depending on whether @xmath44 is included or excluded in the determination of the group s velocity dispersion",
    ", @xmath45 is @xmath46   or @xmath47 .",
    "folding in the uncertainty in the location of the group s center , between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the maximum and minimum estimates of the external shear are @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "consistent with these bounds , other workers have fitted models that require @xmath52 @xcite and @xmath53 @xcite . using an elliptical potential model @xcite",
    "derive a lower limit to the external shear of 0.11 .",
    "thus , by all accounts , the external shear plays a central role in b1422 .",
    "the radio fluxes of the images 1,2,3 and 4 are in the ratio 16:30:33:1 at 8.4 ghz and similar at other radio frequencies @xcite , whereas the flux ratios in the optical and near - infrared are 8:13:16:1 @xcite .",
    "reddening by the lensing galaxy is unlikely because the flux ratios do not change much between different optical wavebands .",
    "microlensing due to stars is also unlikely because the flux ratio of images 2:3 stayed the same while both images changed in brightness ( srianand & narasimha , private communication ) .",
    "this suggests that millilensing may be taking place , , lensing by substructure of scale intermediate between individual stars and the whole galaxy @xcite .",
    "if that is the case then radio fluxes are probing larger structure in the galaxy than the immediate neighborhood of the images .",
    "previous models , ( based on an earlier , incorrectly measured redshift ) rather than the value we use here , namely @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the correction of the redshift implies only a scale - change for these models .",
    "in particular , the time delays predicted by these models must be multiplied by 0.52 . ] while agreeing about the direction of external shear , have been unable to to reproduce the observed flux ratios @xcite .",
    "vlbi maps by @xcite show different shapes and sizes for each image of the quasar core .",
    "it is tempting to identify the ellipticity and area of the core in each image with the relative tensor magnification ; but the quoted area ratios of 1.34:1.47:1.34:1 are very different from the flux ratios , so such an identification would be incorrect .",
    "evidently , the mapped core in image 4 corresponds to a larger area on the source than the mapped cores in images 13 .",
    "still , we would like to incorporate some information from these remarkable vlbi maps into our mass models .",
    "so in this paper we will adopt a compromise : we take the ellipticities of the mapped cores as the ellipticity corresponding to the magnification tensor , but we disregard the areas of the mapped cores and take the fluxes as corresponding to the scalar magnification .",
    "( how this works operationally is explained below , with equation  [ tensormag ] . )",
    "the image and magnification data we use for modeling are collated in table  [ tbl ] .",
    "we remark that since the unlensed flux is unknown , the absolute magnifications are also unknown .",
    "this unknown factor is a manifestation of the mass disk degeneracy ",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "redshifts of six galaxies , including that of the lens , indicate that the lens is a member of a compact group whose line - of - sight velocity dispersion is 550 km / s and median projected radius @xmath54 kpc @xcite .",
    "a faraday rotation corresponding to a rotation measure of @xmath55 rad  m@xmath56 @xcite between images 2 and 3 is much larger than expected from an elliptical galaxy and further supports the presence of a group around the lens .    ' '' ''    we show here the unambiguous detection of diffuse x - ray emission from hot gas belonging to this group in a _",
    "chandra _ observation .",
    "previously , from a rosat hri observation , @xcite had found `` no evidence of extended emission '' over and above the @xmath57 psf of the hri .",
    "figure  [ fig : xray ] shows the 28  ks chandra acis - s observation represented as contours superposed on the hst image taken with the nicmos ( h - band ) by the castles team @xcite , where the four images , and well as the lens galaxy , are distinctly seen .",
    "there is clearly an astrometric offset between the hst and chandra images , which we have made no attempt to correct for .",
    "however , we can safely assume that the two peaks in the x - ray distribution correspond to images 2 and 3 ( brighter ) and 1 .",
    "the diffuse emission outside the source images is softer , and extends to a scale of about 3  arcsec , which corresponds to about @xmath58 kpc at the lens redshift @xmath59 .",
    "b1422 was observed with the acis - s instrument on board the _ chandra _ observatory on 2000 june 1 for 28.8 ks , the data being collected on the back - illuminated s3 ccd .",
    "we applied the standard data processing techniques recommended by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) , including the recent task acisabs , to correct for the absorption , predominantly at softer energies , caused by molecular contamination of the acis optical blocking filters . since the exposure time is long enough , we reprocessed the data without randomizing the event positions , which improved the point - spread function .",
    "periods of high background were filtered out , leaving 28.4 ks of usable data .    ' '' ''    to separate the spectrum of the source quasar from that of the lensing galaxy group , we isolated circular areas of radius 0.7 arcsec around each of the three qso images and extracted the spectrum of the quasar . the power - law fit ( together with galactic absorption ) to it yielded a power - law of slope 1.41 with a reduced @xmath60 statistic of 0.9 .",
    "there was no evidence of extra absorption at the redshift of the quasar .",
    "we then fixed the slope of the power law , and fitted a model of thermal bremsstrahlung plasma ( raymond - smith ) plus the quasar power - law spectrum to the rest of the x - ray emission , keeping the normalization of both components free , but fixing elemental abundance to 0.3 solar ( reasonable for a group or cluster of galaxies ) .",
    "a fit to the data in the range 0.5 - 6 kev yielded a temperature of 0.71 kev for the group of galaxies , which translates into a velocity dispersion range of 150 - 450   @xcite , consistent with the observed dispersion of 550 , or 240(depending on whether @xmath44 is included or not ) .",
    "the fits were performed with the cxc software package sherpa .",
    "the @xmath61 relation ( mass vs. x - ray temperature ) for virialized isothermal systems of galaxies , for mass within a radius @xmath62 , gives a mass of @xmath63 for the above temperature @xcite .",
    "the v - magnitude of the main lensing galaxy is @xmath64 @xcite , which after correction for colour evolution @xcite and @xmath65-correction @xcite yields a luminosity of @xmath66 and a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath67 , far larger than that of a single galaxy .",
    "the bolometric x - ray flux of the diffuse emission is @xmath68 erg  s@xmath69 , which means @xmath70 , also much larger than typical values for galaxies @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the diffuse emission detected by chandra belongs to the group of galaxies the lens is a part of .",
    "significant external shear combined with the fortuitous positioning of the qso source along the same line as the group and the center of the main lensing galaxy ( this alignment is a robust feature in all models for this system ) transforms the case of images 3 and 4 of b1422 into a one - dimensional problem .",
    "as we now show this makes the problem much better constrained than a generic 4(+1 ) image system",
    ".    consider a simplified analytic model of an axisymmetric lens , with the qso source , lens , group center , and the images all lying on the @xmath7-axis .",
    "let the mass distribution in the main galaxy lens around the image - ring be given by a power law , @xmath71 .",
    "its contribution to the lensing potential is @xmath72 , and the deflection angle is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) stands for the image formed on the positive ( negative ) @xmath7-axis , and @xmath76 lumps together all the constants .",
    "the total lensing potential is @xmath77 where we have discarded terms that are zero on the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the lens equation is @xmath78 if we define @xmath79 and @xmath80 and plot them against lens plane coordinate @xmath7 , then images are formed at the intersections .",
    "the four panels of fig .",
    "[ one_d ] show models with four different combinations of ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "all these models satisfy the locations of images 3 and 4 , and the condition that image 4 arrives after 3 .",
    "the vertical offset of @xmath87 is the source location , @xmath88 , while external shear makes @xmath87 shallower .",
    "the difference in galacto - centric distances of images 3 and 4 is given by @xmath89 .",
    "figure  [ one_d ] graphically demonstrates that in a system where images are formed at very different galacto - centric distances ( like 3 and 4 in b1422 ) there is a limit to the shallowness of the galaxy s density profile index , @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that some non - zero @xmath88 is needed to produce large @xmath89 . for shallow density profiles ( such as the one in the upper left panel )",
    "@xmath90 tends to become the diagonal through the ii and iv quadrant .",
    "this makes it very difficult to have @xmath90 intersect @xmath87 while keeping @xmath89 large .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath82 is around @xmath91 .",
    "the figure also shows that @xmath82 and @xmath81 in b1422 are correlated : as profile slopes get steeper , shear must increase as well . for @xmath92 ( profile steeper than isothermal ) @xmath90 become hyperbolic , and a substantial flattening of @xmath87 ( i.e. large external shear ) is required to produce large @xmath89 . note that large shear is necessary for this ; a large @xmath88 by itself is not sufficient .",
    "as long as profile is steeper than a minimum @xmath82 value , one - dimensional lensing case does not prefer large @xmath81 , large @xmath82 solutions over small @xmath81 , small @xmath82 : in fig .",
    "[ one_d ] @xmath93 is as good a fit as @xmath86 .",
    "however , when we consider two dimensions , images 1 and 2 , set an upper limit on the external shear because too large a shear will tend to place images 1 , 2 and 3 in a straight line , perpendicular to the direction towards external shear . since observed images 1,2 and 3 are not in a straight line , the shear is constrained from above .",
    "furthermore , if the tensor magnification information is included in modeling ( as is done in section  [ pixelated ] ) the relative orientation of these for images 1 and 2 also reduced the amplitude of possible shear",
    ".    we can intuitively understand the effect of external shear on the time delays @xmath94 as follows .",
    "if the shear source is far from the image region , the shear can be represented by constant external shear , which provides linear deflection angles at the images .",
    "it corresponds to tilting the side of the arrival - time surface closest to the source of the shear upwards , which moves the zero points in @xmath94 away from the shear source .",
    "images lying on the line through the shear source , qso source and the main galaxy are most affected by this tilting ( images 3 and 4 in b1422 ) , while those lying perpendicular to that line are least affected ( 1 and 2 ) .",
    "thus images 3 and 4 give a well constrained @xmath94 , precisely because they are most sensitive to external shear .    to sum up ,",
    "the fortuitous geometry of b1422 and large external shear imply a relation between profile slope and shear magnitude , and impose a limit on the shallowness of the profile slope of @xmath95 , or a lower limit on shear of @xmath53 , consistent with the shear estimates based on the physical properties of the group ( section  [ ext_shear ] ) .",
    "in addition , images 1 and 2 impose a limit on the steepness of the profile slope ( through an upper limit on shear ) . as a result , @xmath96 should be well constrained .",
    "we now consider more detailed models of galaxy mass distribution in the lens plane .    given the difficulties caused to previous models of b1422 by the observed flux ratios , and especially since we now need to fit tensor magnifications , it is clear that more general models than those are necessary .",
    "moreover , to properly estimate uncertainties , it is necessary to explore not just a few models but large ensembles of them .",
    "the pixelated lens reconstruction method , as developed in @xcite and @xcite , was designed for this purpose .",
    "the idea is to model the lens as a sum of mass tiles or pixels , with two kinds of constraints : the `` primary constraints '' are that the lensing data should be fitted exactly ; `` secondary constraints '' require the mass distribution to be centrally concentrated , not excessively elongated , and optionally inversion - symmetric . here",
    "we follow the method of generating ensembles of models as detailed in the latter paper , but with two minor modifications necessitated by the type of data .",
    "the first modification is needed because the time delay measurements are currently very uncertain .",
    "so instead of including them , we run the reconstruction code with one time delay ( @xmath96 , say ) set to a fiducial value @xmath97 .",
    "the code then generates an ensemble of models , each model having its own @xmath3 and its own set of @xmath98 . because of the scaling properties of the lensing problem",
    ", the only dependence of the results on @xmath97 will be that all the model @xmath99 and @xmath98 will be proportional to it .",
    "hence @xmath100 will be independent of @xmath97 .",
    "a second modification is needed to incorporate tensor magnifications . to do this , we first reconstruct the magnification matrix * m * at each image position from the data in table  [ tbl ] .",
    "we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the scalar magnification ( proportional to the flux ) , @xmath103 is the axis ratio ( if we assume the source is circular ) , @xmath104 is the orientation ( @xmath105 ) , and * r * is a rotation matrix .",
    "the signs of the square roots in equation  [ tensormag ] depend on image parity : for minima both roots will be positive ; for saddle points one will be negative .",
    "having reconstructed * m * at the image positions , we write the observed upper and lower bounds on the axis ratio as bounds on the ratio of the diagonal elements of * m * ( see @xcite for an application of this technique to arclets in cluster lensing ) .",
    "having constrained the axis ratio , we set the flux ratio by introducing a fictitious quad slightly displaced from the actual one ; in particular , fictitious images displaced by @xmath106 correspond to a fictitious source displaced by @xmath107 along the @xmath7-axis of the source plane .",
    "the code is not told @xmath107 itself , just the displacements it maps to ; in this way the magnification ratios are constrained , but not the absolute magnifications .",
    "we have generated three ensembles of models .",
    "each ensemble contains 100 models sampling the allowed ` model space ' given a certain set of constraints .",
    "the first ensemble uses the data from table  [ tbl ] , together with the generic secondary constraints @xcite including inversion symmetry of galaxy - lens .",
    "figure  [ mass_s ] shows the ensemble - average mass map , while fig .",
    "[ delay_s ] shows the distribution of predicted time delays .",
    "( the ` radial profile index ' in fig .",
    "[ delay_s ] corresponds approximately to @xmath108 in the previous section . )",
    "the qualitative results are just as expected from our preceding discussion : ( i ) images 1,2,3 are very close in @xmath94 , with 4 arriving much later ; ( ii ) @xmath82 is nearly confined to a narrow range 0.60.8 ; ( iii ) while @xmath96 has a broad peak with median @xmath109 days , it is much better constrained than in models of other well - studied quads @xcite .    for the second ensemble we dropped the inversion - symmetry constraint .",
    "figures  [ mass_a ] and [ delay_a ] show the results .",
    "qualitatively , the results are similar , but the predicted @xmath110 shifts to a higher range ( median @xmath111 days )",
    ". one must keep in mind that observed image properties tightly constrain the position angle of the shear , not its radial location .",
    "so non - inversion - symmetric modeling of lens systems with large external shear will produce mass profiles that are artificially elongated towards the source of external shear .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ mass_a ] .",
    "the elongation results because the model can not decide how far away to place the source of the shear .",
    "thus , for systems with non - disturbed galaxy lenses and large external shear the inversion - symmetric models are probably somewhat more trustworthy than non - inversion - symmetric ones .    for the third ensemble we put back the inversion - symmetry constraint , but drop the magnification constraint .",
    "figure  [ delay_n ] shows the time - delay predictions .",
    "( the ensemble - average mass map looks similar to fig .",
    "[ mass_s ] and we have not included it here . ) comparison of fig .",
    "[ delay_n ] and fig .",
    "[ delay_s ] shows what magnification information adds to modeling . basically , magnification measurements put constraints on the mass distribution in the neighborhood of the images .",
    "time delays between nearby images becomes better constrained .",
    "thus fig .",
    "[ delay_n ] has a much larger spread in @xmath112 and @xmath113 than fig .",
    "[ delay_s ] . without magnifications ,",
    "some models @xmath112 or @xmath113 can become zero : magnifications for the images in question can get arbitrarily large , effectively merging those images . also , the upper bound on @xmath82 that we argue comes from images 1 and 2 is greatly weakened . on the other hand , time delays between distant images",
    "is hardly affected : as anticipated in section  [ simple ] , @xmath110 in fig .",
    "[ delay_n ] has a median ( @xmath114 days ) and range very similar to those in fig .",
    "[ delay_s ] .    ' '' ''",
    "in the introduction , we mentioned four unusual features that make b1422 a particularly interesting lens .",
    "we now summarize what the results of this paper indicate about each of these features .",
    "first , we have the surprising result that being dominated by external shear from group galaxies makes the lens _ better _ constrained . the predicted time delays , in particular the longest delay @xmath96 , though it has a broad range , is narrower than in other comparable systems . the fortuitous alignment of the source displacement and the shear appears to help .",
    "second , one detail of the group contribution is important . of two situations :",
    "( i )  the lensing galaxy has @xmath115-rotation symmetry and the shear comes from relatively distant group members , and ( ii )  the lensing galaxy is asymmetric and elongated along the group direction , the second case gives @xmath96 50% longer .",
    "optical and x - ray ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xray ] ) images of the galaxy and group are not conclusive on this point .",
    "third , tensor magnifications from fluxes and vlbi constrain time delays between nearby images ; but remarkably they have no discernible effect on longer time delays , @xmath96 .",
    "the physical reason is not hard to appreciate : magnification is essentially the second derivative of the time delay , hence time delays between widely separated images tend to wash out the sort of local variations of density that cause differences in magnifications .",
    "fourth , comparison with time - delay measurements is still problematic at present .",
    "@xcite report @xmath116 , whereas our reconstructions predict @xmath117 .",
    "the difficulty is that our predicted values would not be expected to show up in the patnaik & narasimha data , which sample at @xmath118 ; instead , aliases of our predicted values would show up .",
    "even with closely - sampled data , a @xmath117 is unlikely to be measurable because it would need intrinsic brightness variations on the scale of hours . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted @xmath119 is a convenient length for measurements ; but unfortunately it involves image 4 , whose flux is @xmath120 times smaller .",

    "<S> b1422 + 231 is a quadruply - imaged qso with an exceptionally large lensing contribution from group galaxies other than main lensing galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we detect diffuse x - rays from the galaxy group in archival chandra observations ; the inferred temperature is consistent with the published velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we then explore the range of possible mass maps that would be consistent with the observed image positions , radio fluxes , and ellipticities . under plausible but not very restrictive assumptions about the lensing galaxy , </S>",
    "<S> predicted time delays involving the faint fourth image are fairly well constrained around @xmath0 . </S>"
