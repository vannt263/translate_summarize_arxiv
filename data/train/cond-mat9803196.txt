    "over the last three decades polyelectrolyte solutions have found a number of practical applications ranging from super - absorbents and hair conditioners to water treatment .",
    "many biologically important molecules such as dna , are also polyelectrolytes .",
    "not withstanding their practical importance our theoretical understanding of the behavior of these complex molecules is still quite rudimentary @xcite .",
    "the fundamental problem which makes the study of polyelectrolytes so much more difficult than that of regular polymers is the long - ranged nature of the coulomb force .",
    "the scaling theories , which have proven so useful for simple polymers have , so far , failed in the case of polyelectrolyte solutions .",
    "even the mean - field theories are extremely hard to construct , as one tries to take a realistic account of the long - ranged electrostatic interactions",
    ".    in general a polyion is a polymer some of whose monomers are ionized ( all of the ionized monomers have the same sign of charge ) . in most practical applications",
    "the polyions are dissolved in some solvent , usually water , causing a strong interaction between the charged monomers and the counterions . besides this , already very complex interaction , in the case of a flexible chain one must also take into account the conformational degrees of freedom of the polymer , as well as the interactions between the macromolecules inside the solution .",
    "the full problem is extremely difficult to study , however , some simulations have been attempted @xcite . a somewhat simpler problem , an answer to which we shall attempt to elucidate in this paper , is the properties of rigid polyelectrolytes .",
    "an example of rigid polyelectrolyte is a solution of dna segments .",
    "a major simplification resulting from restricting our attention to rigid polyions is that these can be modeled as cylinders , thus allowing us to bypass the complication of taking a full account of the conformational degrees of freedom . at high densities",
    "the rigid molecules tend to align forming a smectic phase .",
    "the periodic structure of the smetic phase allows us a major simplification of studying _",
    "one _ polyion inside a wigner - seitz cell , since all of the cells are identical @xcite . at low volume fractions ,",
    "when the solution is isotropic , the wigner - seitz picture is no longer valid , and a new approach must be found . on the other hand , it is well known that at infinite dilution the polyelectrolyte solutions obey the manning limiting laws @xcite .",
    "although derived in a somewhat _ ad hoc _ manner , the limiting laws have proven extremely successful and provide a  boundary condition \" that any theory of polyelectrolytes must satisfy .",
    "recently we have extended the debye - hckel - bjerrum ( dhbj ) theory @xcite to rigid polyelectrolyte solutions and found that at infinite dilution it , indeed , reduces to the manning limiting laws @xcite .",
    "however , consideri ng the higher density corrections , we have found that the limiting laws should apply only at extremely low densities , since the corrections scale as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the density of polyions @xcite . what can then account for the success of limiting laws at densities which are not so small ? in this paper we shall extend the dhbj theory to realistic concentrations encountered in most applications .",
    "dhbj theory has proven to be successful in a variety of systems whose dominant interactions are due to the long - ranged coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "the fundamental idea behind the theory is that the nonlinearities which are omitted in the process of linearization of the poisson - boltzmann equation can be re - introduced into the theory through a thermodynamic assumption that the oppositely charged particles can associate , forming clusters .",
    "the density of these clusters will , then , be determined by the condition that at equilibrium the total free energy of the system must be minimum . in this sense ,",
    "the dhbj theory provides a kind of variational approximation to the complete , yet unknown , theory . by virtue of being linear",
    ", dhbj theory bypasses the internal inconsistencies which complicate many of the nonlinear theories of ionic solutions @xcite .    in the case of symmetric electrolytes ,",
    "the clusters correspond to the dipolar pairs formed when two oppositely charged ions come into a close contact @xcite .",
    "these are exactly the kind of configurations which become  undervalued \" when one linearizes the boltzmann factor . for the polyelectrolyte",
    ", the polyions of which can carry a charge which can be many thousands units ( unit = electron charge ) , there can be a large variety of clusters .",
    "in general we expect that there will be clusters consisting of one polyion and one counterion , one polyion and two counterions , one polyion and three counterions , etc .",
    "the successful theory should allow us to calculate the full distribution of cluster densities .",
    "in the previous work we have demonstrated that in the limit of infinite dilution only one characteristic cluster size is thermodynamically stable @xcite . this is the same as was previously postulated by manning @xcite .",
    "however , as one moves away from infinite dilution , one must consider the full distribu tion of cluster sizes @xcite , and this will be the objective of this paper .",
    "we shall first define the primitive model of polyelectrolyte ( pmp ) @xcite .",
    "our system will consist of long cylindric polyions , the spherical counterions , and salt , inside a volume @xmath3 .",
    "the polyions , of length @xmath4 and density @xmath5 , have diameter @xmath6 , and charge @xmath7 uniformly distributed along the length of the cylinder .",
    "the distance between charged groups is @xmath8 .",
    "the counterions will be modeled as rigid spheres of diameter @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 located at the center .",
    "the overall charge neutrality requires that the density of counterions be @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to the polyions and the counterions we shall allow for the presence of salt of density @xmath12 . in this work we shall consider a simple monovalent salt and , in particular , treat the positive ions of salt as identical to the counterions .",
    "we shall , therefore , consider only two species of small ions , the ones with charge @xmath10 , which we shall denote _ counterions _ indiscriminantly of whether they are derived from the p olymer or the salt , and the _ coions _ with charge @xmath13 , derived from dissociation of salt molecules .",

    "the characteristic size of a cluster is @xmath172 . in fig.@xmath47",
    "we demonstrate the dependence of the average charge of a cluster ,    @xmath173    on @xmath174 , and compare it to the infinite - dilution counterion condensation theory @xcite .",
    "we note that the sharp counterion condensation transition disappears at finite densities , replaced by a smooth crossover .",

    "we have constructed a dhbj theory for an isotropic polyelectrolyte solution .",
    "we find that , at equilibrium , the solution consists of free polyions , free counterions , and clusters composed of one polyion and @xmath175 counterions .",
    "the distribution of cluster sizes was calculated explicitly as was the osmotic pressure . a good agreement with the experimental data of alexandrowicz",
    "was obtained .",
    "finally , it is important to note that the sharp counterion condensation observed at @xmath176 for infinite dilution , gets  smoothed out \" for finite densities .",
    "this is indeed what one might have expected based on the modern theory of phase transitions .",
    "it is well known that the higher - order phase transitions ( second and above ) are associated with a diverging length scale . in the ionic systems the length scale relevant to the counterion condensation phenomena is the debye screening length . in the case of polyelectrolyte solutions ,",
    "this length will stay finite for any non - zero temperature . in this respect",
    "the counter ion condensation is very different from the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) metal - insulator transition observed in two - dimensional plasma @xcite .",
    "the kt transition is a real thermodynamic phase transition at which the debye length becomes infinite .",
    "it is important to stress this difference in view of the recent speculations that the counterion condensation is a kt - like phase transition @xcite .",
    "instead we should compare the counterion association with a micellar formation in amphiphilic systems .",
