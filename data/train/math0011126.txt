    "following @xcite we make the following definitions :    given a hyperbolic @xmath1-orbifold @xmath2 with cusps @xmath3 we say that cusps @xmath4 are _ geometrically isolated _ from cusps @xmath5 if any deformation of the hyperbolic structure on @xmath2 induced by dehn filling cusps @xmath6 while keeping cusps @xmath7 complete does not change the euclidean structure at cusps @xmath4 .",
    "we say that cusps @xmath8 are _ first order isolated _ from cusps @xmath9 if the map from the space of deformations induced by dehn filling cusps @xmath6 while keeping cusps @xmath7 complete to the space of euclidean structures at cusps @xmath10 has zero derivative at the point corresponding to the complete structure .",
    "we say that cusps @xmath8 are _ strongly geometrically isolated _ from cusps @xmath9 if for any fixed dehn filling on cusps @xmath8 , the geometry of the ( possibly filled ) cusps @xmath8 is unchanged by any dehn filling on cusps @xmath9 .",
    "it is immediate from these definitions that strong isolation implies geometric isolation , which in turn implies first order isolation .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that first order isolation and strong isolation are symmetric conditions in the sets @xmath7 and @xmath9 , and that they can be given an analytic definition in terms of the @xmath11 function defined in @xcite .",
    "neumann and reid in @xcite construct a @xmath0-cusped hyperbolic orbifold @xmath12 with geometrically isolated cusps .",
    "based on numerical evidence , they conjectured that the cusps are strongly isolated .",
    "the orbifold @xmath12 is particularly interesting for two reasons : firstly it is arithmetic , and secondly , all other known examples of manifolds with strongly isolated cusps contain a rigid totally geodesic separating surface which  forces \" the isolation . there is evidence that this example does not contain such a surface , based on the fact that its volume is so small . in this paper",
    "we find explicit formulae describing how the tetrahedra making up an ideal triangulation of @xmath12 are distorted as the hyperbolic structure on @xmath12 is deformed which suggests that the existence of such a surface is unlikely .",
    "@xmath13 is a @xmath14cusp link complement in @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath12 is obtained from @xmath13 by @xmath16 dehn surgery on two of the links .",
    "it is a curious fact , which we will exploit in our calculations , that @xmath13 is a double cover of @xmath12 , obtained by a twofold branching of @xmath15 over the two filled cusps .",
    "we can draw @xmath13 as a @xmath17 complement .",
    "the two removed cusps are linked as in figure 2 .",
    "the two cusps in the figure we label as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the cusp @xmath21 , and @xmath22 the cusp @xmath23 . as in @xcite",
    "we let @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the logarithm of the holonomy of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the meridian and longitude respectively of cusp @xmath28 .",
    "rotating through an angle @xmath29 gives the same link complement after isotopy .",
    "in fact , we can see that @xmath13 retains its @xmath14fold symmetry even after cusps @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath30filled .",
    "hence the cusp shapes at @xmath21 and @xmath31 are constant . by taking the quotient",
    "we see that in @xmath12 the two cusps are geometrically isolated .",
    "note that this technique can be generalized .",
    "let @xmath2 be any @xmath14fold symmetric @xmath17 2link complement for which there is an orientation  preserving isometry permuting each pair of cusps .",
    "quotienting by this isometry we obtain an orbifold in which one cusp is geometrically isolated from the other .",
    "alternatively , let @xmath2 be any @xmath14fold symmetric @xmath17 knot complement .",
    "then the cusp corresponding to this knot is geometrically isolated from the other two cusps .",
    "it is not difficult to construct infinitely many examples this way .",
    "@xmath13 has a hyperbolic structure with fundamental domain given by two regular ideal hyperbolic octahedra identified along their boundaries . to see this , note that @xmath13 consists of an alternating link complement in @xmath17 , and therefore by general properties of alternating links , a fundamental domain for @xmath13",
    "can be found by two  coloring the surface on which the link projection lies ( in this case a torus ) , and gluing the regions above and below this surface with a twist of @xmath29 or @xmath32 according to the coloring ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the link in @xmath13 separates the dividing torus into two squares .",
    "the suspension on each of these squares for which the suspension points are cusps @xmath20 and @xmath22 is an octahedron , from which the vertices are removed , since they lie on the cusps .",
    "gluing the top four faces of each octahedron in the obvious manner , the bottom four faces of each are identified with a twist of @xmath33 , relative to the top identification .",
    "the pattern of identifications is given in figure 3 .    to prove that @xmath12 is strongly geometrically isolated , it suffices to show that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are functions solely of @xmath36 and of @xmath37 respectively ; i.e. that we can define @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we subdivide each octahedron into @xmath14 ideal tetrahedra by cutting along the two faces @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so that each tetrahedron has vertices @xmath42 and @xmath20 .",
    "we denote the simplex parameters of the four tetrahedra from the first octahedron as @xmath43 relative to the central edge , and for the tetrahedra from the second octahedron as @xmath44 .",
    "the triangulated cusp shapes for the complete structure are given in figure 4 .",
    "in the notation of @xcite we have the consistency relations    @xmath45 @xmath46    the holonomies of @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the four cusps are    @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52    since we are lifting dehn surgeries from @xmath12 , we require that    @xmath53    from which , and from the dehn surgery equations it will follow that    @xmath54    as in @xcite we denote @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "reparameterizing , we find that we can write everything in terms of two complex variables , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ". we can define the simplex parameters in terms of these two variables as follows :    @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62    with these definitions , it can easily be verified that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are functions only of @xmath58 , and that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are functions only of @xmath57 ; for example , @xmath67 , which is a function only of @xmath58",
    ". explicitly we can calculate    @xmath68 @xmath69    we therefore have the following :    the orbifold @xmath12 has strongly isolated cusps .",
    "there is a nice geometric definition of the parameterization in terms of the two complex numbers @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which we now describe .    given a square @xmath70 in the complex plane of side length @xmath71 , with vertices at @xmath72",
    ", we choose a point @xmath73 at the complex number @xmath57 .",
    "we construct the points @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 so that the triangles @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are similar with angles @xmath82 and @xmath83 , as illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "then it is an easy calculation to see that as complex numbers , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore the octagon @xmath86 tiles the complex plane .",
    "the four triangles @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are precisely ( up to similarity ) the horoball sections of the simplices @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively after dehn filling cusps @xmath22 and @xmath20 .",
    "there is a similar , though `` mirror reversed '' picture describing how @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are determined as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "from the fact that this octagon tiles the plane , the consistency relations @xmath99 and @xmath100 are geometrically obvious . from the mirror - reversed picture , the consistency relations @xmath101 and @xmath102 can similarly be deduced .    a relation of the form @xmath103 is equivalent to the geometric fact that the orientation preserving similarity taking @xmath104 to @xmath105 takes @xmath74 to the midpoint of @xmath106 .",
    "from simple relations such as these , the independence of @xmath107 and @xmath108 from @xmath57 and of @xmath109 and @xmath110 from @xmath58 can be seen .",
    "there is an interesting relationship between the parameterization of dehn surgery parameter space by real pairs @xmath111 , and by @xmath112 . in particular , we have the following    [ circle_par ] the circle @xmath113 corresponds to the values of @xmath114 lying on the square with vertices at @xmath115 .",
    "the circle @xmath116 passes through the square in the complex plane with vertices at @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , by the description in section  4 , it corresponds precisely to the values of @xmath58 for which four of the simplices are degenerate . that is to say , the simplex parameters @xmath118 are real . by symmetry",
    ", we need only consider the case that @xmath58 lies on a fixed `` quadrant '' of the circle , for the sake of argument , the arc between @xmath119 and @xmath120 in figure 5 .",
    "however we know that @xmath121 @xmath122 and moreover , that @xmath123    but then , by inspecting figure 5 it can be seen that for @xmath58 taking values on this arc , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , so that @xmath127 must take the values of @xmath128 respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath129 .",
    "it is a simple matter to check that @xmath130 , and therefore that @xmath131 .    by a continuity argument",
    ", it can be seen that vertices @xmath120 and @xmath119 correspond to the points @xmath132 and @xmath133 in @xmath134 space , and the proof follows .",
    "notice of course that a corresponding fact holds for @xmath135 and @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath136 for @xmath137 taking values on the square with vertices as in theorem  [ circle_par ] .    by a similar argument",
    "we can show    the `` circle '' @xmath138 corresponds to the values of @xmath137 lying on the square with vertices @xmath139    for the sake of argument , the infinite circle can be understood as a limit of larger and larger circles , in the hausdorff topology on the riemann sphere @xmath140 .",
    "it is easy to see that as @xmath141 , the simplex parameters @xmath142 ( that is to say , their orientation and volume is negative ) .",
    "this implies that each of @xmath143 approaches the value of @xmath144 or @xmath145 according to which branch of the logarithm is taken .",
    "this depends on which homotopy path @xmath58 takes from @xmath146 to @xmath147 in the @xmath14-punctured sphere @xmath148 .",
    "we restrict the values of @xmath58 for the moment to the simply connected domain consisting of @xmath149 minus the four infinite rays emanating from the four corners of the square .",
    "the appropriate branch of the logarithm can then be determined by observing how the simplex parameters deform as @xmath141 and then requiring that @xmath150 be continuous .",
    "it remains to check that @xmath151 in the limit . without loss of generality",
    ", we choose @xmath58 with @xmath152 .",
    "then @xmath153 , by the argument above .",
    "it suffices to check that @xmath154 as @xmath141 .",
    "but by the parameterization in terms of @xmath58 , it is immediate that @xmath155 .",
    "the case for other large absolute values of @xmath58 follows by symmetry , and a continuity argument for the cases that @xmath156 .",
    "the proof follows .",
    "one must be wary about assuming that geometric structures corresponding to the case that @xmath137 lie in the interior of the square with vertices as in theorem  [ circle_par ] exist .    for the case that @xmath137",
    "lie on this square , four of the tetrahedra are flat and disjoint except at the vertices .",
    "the other four tetrahedra can be glued to the flat four , to produce an incomplete hyperbolic manifold , by the consistency equations .",
    "the fact that each flat tetrahedra has a ( geometric ) bicollared neighborhood in the manifold so obtained not intersecting any of the other four tetrahedra implies that one can `` pump some air '' into each of the four flat tetrahedra without changing the homeomorphism type of the manifold .",
    "that is to say , the incomplete manifold so obtained is homeomorphic to @xmath13 , and the complete manifold obtained by performing geometric dehn surgery is homeomorphic to a manifold obtained by topological dehn surgery on @xmath13 .",
    "note by a theorem proved in @xcite one can find geometric structures corresponding to @xmath137 in an open neighborhood of @xmath157  that is to say , including some cases in which four of the tetrahedra are negatively oriented .",
    "notice that as @xmath58 approaches one of @xmath117 that one of the @xmath158 triangles in a horoball section gets arbitrarily small with respect to the other three .",
    "this is to say , the length of the filled geodesic in a complete structure ( if one were to exist ) goes to infinity .",
    "this suggests that the orbifolds @xmath159 contain incompressible tori or annuli , a fact which can be verified geometrically .",
    "the author wishes to express his gratitude to walter neumann and iain aitchison with whom he had many very fruitful conversations regarding the material in this paper .",
