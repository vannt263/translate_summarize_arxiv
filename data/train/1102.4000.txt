    "this increase in uncertainty is due to our ignorance about the physical but unmeasurable time - separation variable .",

    "for the lorentz - boosted ground state with @xmath109 , the density matrix of eq.([den33 ] ) becomes that of the harmonic oscillator in a thermal equilibrium state if @xmath110 is identified as the boltzmann factor  @xcite .",
    "for other states , it is very difficult , if not impossible , to describe them as thermal equilibrium states . unlike the case of temperature , the entropy",

    "indeed , the entropy in this case is derivable directly from the hadronic speed .    the time - separation variable exists in the lorentz - covariant world , but we pretend not to know about it .",
    "it thus is in feynman s rest of the universe .",
    "if we do not measure this time - separation , it becomes translated into the entropy .",

    "the two - mode squeezed state tells us how this happens . in the two - mode case ,",
    "both the first and second photons are observable , but we can choose not to observe the second photon .    .",
    "the hydrogen atom played the pivotal role while the present form of quantum mechanics was developed . at that time , the proton was in the absolute galilean frame of reference , and it was thinkable that the proton could move with a speed close to that of light .    also , at that time , both the proton and electron were point particles .",
    "however , the discovery of hofstadter _",
    "_ changed the picture of the proton in 1955  @xcite .",
    "the proton charge has its internal distribution . within the framework of quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "it is possible to calculate the rutherford formula for the electron - proton scattering when both electron and proton are point particles . because the proton is not a point particle",
    ", there is a deviation from the rutherford formula .",
    "we describe this deviation using the formula called the `` proton form factor '' which depends on the momentum transfer during the electron - proton scattering .",
    "indeed , the study of the proton form factor has been and still is one of the central issues in high - energy physics .",
    "the form factor decreases as the momentum transfer increases .",
    "its behavior is called the `` dipole cut - off '' meaning an inverse - square decrease , and it has been a challenging problem in quantum field theory and other theoretical models  @xcite . since the emergence of the quark model in 1964  @xcite ,",
    "the hadrons are regarded as quantum bound states of quarks with space - time wave functions .",
    "thus , the quark model is responsible for explaining this form factor .",
    "there are indeed many papers written on this subject .",
    "we shall return to this problem in subsec .",
    "[ formfac ] .",
    "another problem in high - energy physics is feynman s parton picture  @xcite .",
    "if the hadron is at rest , we can approach this problem within the framework of bound - state quantum mechanics .",
    "if it moves with a speed close to that of light , it appears as a collection of an infinite number of partons , which interact with external signals incoherently .",
    "this phenomenon raises the question of whether the lorentz boost destroys quantum coherence  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the concept of feynman s decoherence  @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss this problem first .          in 1969 , feynman observed that a fast - moving hadron can be regarded as a collection of many `` partons '' whose properties appear to be quite different from those of the quarks  @xcite .",
    "for example , the number of quarks inside a static proton is three , while the number of partons in a rapidly moving proton appears to be infinite .",
    "the question then is how the proton looking like a bound state of quarks to one observer can appear different to an observer in a different lorentz frame ?",
    "feynman made the following systematic observations .",
    "* the picture is valid only for hadrons moving with velocity close to that of light . *",
    "the interaction time between the quarks becomes dilated , and partons behave as free independent particles .",
    "* the momentum distribution of partons becomes widespread as the hadron moves fast . *",
    "the number of partons seems to be infinite or much larger than that of quarks .",
    "because the hadron is believed to be a bound state of two or three quarks , each of the above phenomena appears as a paradox , particularly b ) and c ) together .",
    "how can a free particle have a wide - spread momentum distribution ?    in order to address this question ,",
    "let us go to fig .",
    "[ parton ] , which illustrates the lorentz - squeeze property of the hadron as the hadron gains its speed .",
    "if we use the harmonic oscillator wave function , its momentum - energy wave function takes the same form as the space - time wave function . as the hadron gains its speed ,",
    "both wave functions become squeezed .",
    "as the wave function becomes squeezed , the distribution becomes wide - spread , the spring constant appear to become weaker .",
    "consequently , the constituent quarks appear to become free particles .",
    "if the constituent particles are confined in the narrow elliptic region , they become like massless particles .",
    "if those massless particles have a wide - spread momentum distribution , it is like a black - body radiation with infinite number of photon distributions .",
    "we have addressed this question extensively in the literature , and concluded gell - mann s quark model and feynman s parton model are two different manifestations of the same lorentz - covariant quantity  @xcite .",
    "thus coherent quarks and incoherent partons are perfectly consistent within the framework of quantum mechanics and special relativity  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this defines feynman s decoherence  @xcite .",
    "more recently , we were able to explain this decoherence problem in terms of the interaction time among the constituent quarks and the time required for each quark to interact with external signals  @xcite .      as early as in 1970 , fujimura _ et al .",
    "_ calculated the electromagnetic form factor of the proton using the wave functions given in this paper and obtained the so - called `` dipole '' cut - off of the form factor  @xcite . at that time , these authors did not have a benefit of the differential equation of feynman and his co - authors  @xcite . since",
    "their wave functions can now be given a bona - fide covariant probability interpretation , their calculation could be placed between the two limiting cases of quarks and partons .    even before the calculation of fujimura _",
    "_ in 1965 , the covariant wave functions were discussed by various authors  @xcite . in 1970 ,",
    "licht and pagnamenta also discussed this problem with lorentz - contracted wave functions  @xcite .    in our 1973 paper  @xcite",
    ", we attempted to explain the covariant oscillator wave function in terms of the coherence between the incoming signal and the width of the contracted wave function .",
    "this aspect was explained in terms of the overlap of the energy - momentum wave function in our book  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to go back to the coherence problem we raised in 1973 , and follow - up on it . in the lorentz frame where the momentum of the proton has the opposite signs before and after the collision ,",
    "the four - momentum transfer is @xmath113 where the proton comes along the @xmath38 direction with its momentum @xmath114 , and its energy @xmath115 .",
    "then the form factor becomes @xmath116 if we use the ground - state oscillator wave function , this integral becomes @xmath117 after the @xmath39 integration , this integral becomes @xmath118 the integrand is a product of a gaussian factor and a sinusoidal oscillation .",
    "the width of the gaussian factor shrinks by @xmath119 , which becomes @xmath120 as @xmath54 becomes large .",
    "the wave length of the sinusoidal factor is inversely proportional to the momentum @xmath114 .",
    "the wave length decreases also at the rate of @xmath121 thus , the rate of the shrinkage is the same for both the gaussian and sinusoidal factors . for this reason , the cutoff rate of the form factor of eq.([ff11 ] ) should be less than that for @xmath122 which corresponds to the form factor without the squeeze effect on the wave function .",
    "the integration of this expression lead to @xmath123 which corresponds to an exponential cut - off as @xmath124 becomes large .",
    "let us go back to the form factor of eq.([ff11 ] ) .",
    "if we complete the integral , it becomes @xmath125 as @xmath124 becomes large , the gaussian factor becomes a constant .",
    "however , the factor @xmath126 leads the form factor decrease of @xmath127 , which is a much slower decrease than the exponential cut - off without squeeze effect .",
    "there still is a gap between this mathematical formula and the observed experimental data . before looking at the experimental curve",
    ", we have to realize that there are three quarks inside the hadron with two oscillator mode .",
    "this will lead to a @xmath128 cut - off , which is commonly called the dipole cut - off in the literature .",
    "there is still more work to be done .",
    "for instance , the effect of the quark spin should be addressed  @xcite . also there are reports of deviations from the exact dipole cut - off  @xcite .",
    "there have been attempts to study the form factors based on the four - dimensional rotation group  @xcite , and also on the lattice qcd  @xcite ,    yet , it is gratifying to note that the effect of lorentz squeeze lead to the polynomial decrease in the momentum transfer , thanks to the lorentz coherence illustrated in fig .",
