    "this paper is a continuation of the series of papers ( papers i  xii ) of radial - velocity studies of close binary stars and presents data for the twelfth group of ten close binary stars observed at the david dunlap observatory . for full references to the previous papers , see the last paper by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper xii ) ; for technical details and conventions , for preliminary estimates of uncertainties , and for a description of the broadening functions ( bfs ) technique , see the interim summary paper by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper vii ) .",
    "the ddo studies use the efficient program of @xcite for removal of cosmic rays from 2-d images .",
    "all data used in the present paper were obtained using the broadening functions extracted from the region of the mg  i triplet at 5184   , as in most of the previous papers . in august 2005 ,",
    "a new 2160 lines / mm grating was acquired to replace the previously most frequently used 1800 lines / mm grating which after many years of use lost its efficiency .",
    "the new grating markedly improved quality of the observed spectra and of the resulting bfs . of the reported results ,",
    "the older grating was used for 1997 observations of v357  peg , v1123  tau and v1128  tau ( this star was also briefly observed in 2003 ) ; all three stars were later re - observed using the new grating .",
    "the radial velocity ( hereafter rv ) observations reported in this paper have been collected between october 1997 and august 2007 .",
    "the ranges of dates for individual systems can be found in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "a few additional , low quality spectra of py  vir , not listed in table  [ tab1 ] , were taken on february 19 , 2008 .",
    "selection of the targets in our program remains quasi - random : at a given time , we observe a few dozen close binary systems with periods usually shorter than one day , brighter than 10  11 magnitude and with declinations @xmath1 ; we publish the results in groups of ten systems as soon as reasonable orbital elements are obtained from measurements evenly distributed in orbital phase . for this paper , we selected mostly targets from among fainter _ hipparcos _ discoveries .",
    "none of the present targets has a spectroscopic orbit published .",
    "v1003  her and py  vir have only relatively poor , ground - based photometric data while v1191  cyg is a rather neglected but  as we describe  a very interesting contact binary .",
    "the radial velocities for the short period binaries reported in this paper were determined by fitting the double rotational profiles , as explained in @xcite .",
    "similarly as in our previous papers dealing with multiple systems ( here the cases of bd+73142 and py  vir ) , rv s for the eclipsing pair were obtained after removal of the slowly rotating components @xcite .    as in other papers of this series ,",
    "whenever possible , we estimate spectral types of the program stars using new classification spectra centered at 4200   or 4400  .",
    "these are compared with the mean @xmath2 color indices usually taken from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite and the photometric estimates of the spectral types using the relations of @xcite . in this paper",
    "we also made use of infrared colors determined from 2@xmath3 all sky survey @xcite .",
    "especially useful is the @xmath4 color index , which is monotonically rising from the early spectral types to about m0v @xcite .",
    "this infrared color is affected relatively less by the interstellar absorption than @xmath5 .",
    "parallaxes cited throughout the paper were adopted from the new reduction of the _ hipparcos _ data @xcite which supersede the original reductions @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured in a way similar to that of previous papers , in that most of the data for the observed binaries are in two tables consisting of the rv measurements in table  [ tab1 ] and of their preliminary sine - curve solutions in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "radial velocities and the corresponding spectroscopic orbits for all ten systems are shown in phase diagrams in figures  [ fig1 ]  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the measured rv s are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "only data with full weights were used to compute the orbits ; we discarded poorer observations .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] contains also our new spectral classifications of the program objects .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] of the paper contains summaries of previous studies for individual systems and comments on the new data .",
    "examples of bfs of individual systems extracted from spectra observed close to quadratures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "the data in table  [ tab2 ] are organized in the same manner as in the previous papers of this series .",
    "in addition to the parameters of spectroscopic orbits , the table provides information about the relation between the spectroscopically observed upper conjunction of the more massive component , @xmath6 ( not necessarily the primary eclipse ) and the recent photometric determinations of the primary minimum in the form of the @xmath7 deviations for the number of elapsed periods @xmath8 .",
    "the reference ephemerides were taken from various sources : for v1003  her , we doubled the _ hipparcos _ period and shifted the instant of the maximum by @xmath9 ; for bd+73142 , we took it from the asasasas/ ] survey @xcite ; for v407  peg , from @xcite and for py  vir , from @xcite .",
    "for the rest of the systems , the ephemerides given in the on - line version of `` an atlas o - c diagrams of eclipsing binary stars '' @xcite were adopted .",
    "because the on - line ephemerides are frequently updated , we give those used for the computation of the @xmath7 residuals in the comments to table  [ tab2 ] ( the status as of december 2007 ) .",
    "the deeper eclipse in w - type contact binary systems corresponds to the lower conjunction of the more massive component ; in such cases the epoch in table  [ tab2 ] is a half - integer number .",
    "the variability of eg  cep was discovered by @xcite .",
    "photoelectric light curves and their solutions have been presented by several investigators ; for references see @xcite .",
    "the system shows a @xmath10  lyrae - type light curve with minima about 1.0 and 0.3 mag deep .",
    "@xcite determined the projected rotational velocity of the primary as @xmath11 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "a photometric analysis of the system was performed by @xcite who used a grid search to find the mass ratio @xmath13 and a semi - detached configuration for the system .",
    "@xcite discussed the long - term period change in the system and also arrived at the semi - detached configuration with the less massive component filling its roche lobe and the mass ratio @xmath14 = 0.47 .",
    "the new analysis of @xcite led to a similar mass ratio .",
    "no spectroscopic orbit of the system has been published so far .    in view of discrepancies between the spectroscopic and photometric mass ratios previously noted in our ddo series , it is surprising , but also encouraging , that all photometric investigations have led to a mass ratio close to our spectroscopic value , @xmath15 = 0.464(5 ) .",
    "this is in spite of the semi - detached configuration which has weaker photometric constraints than the contact configuration in the light curve solution .",
    "the agreement must result from the high orbital inclination angle , @xmath16 @xcite and the presence of the total eclipses .",
    "the intrinsic color of the system was estimated at about @xmath17 = 0.197 @xcite indicating the spectral type of the primary component of a7 .",
    "the tycho-2 color index @xmath18 is consistent with our a7v classification and requires a slight reddening .",
    "the @xmath19 color indicates the a9v ",
    "f2v spectral type which may reflect the stronger contribution of the secondary component .",
    "eg  cep was not included into the _ hipparcos _ astrometric measurements .",
    "the variability of the contact binary v1191  cyg ( gsc 3159 - 1512 , @xmath20 = 10.82 , @xmath21 = 11.15 ) was detected by @xcite while observing the nearby star v1187  cyg . since",
    "then the system was rather neglected with the only thorough photometric analysis of @xcite , who found that the orbital period of the system increases at a record rapid ( for contact binaries ) rate of @xmath22 = 2.12  10@xmath23 year@xmath12 .",
    "the system is totally eclipsing so the geometric elements derived through a light curve solution , @xmath24 = 80.4 , @xmath25 = 0.094 and @xmath26 = 0.46 were well defined in the solution of @xcite .",
    "the deeper minimum is flat , hence the system was classified as a w - type contact binary .",
    "the authors determined @xmath27 ( uncorrected for the interstellar absorption ) .",
    "no spectroscopic study of the system has been published yet .",
    "we found v1191  cyg to be a rather difficult spectroscopic target due to its relative faintness , the short orbital period of @xmath28 days and the weakness of the mg  i triplet lines .",
    "as a solution , we took 129 spectra evenly covering all phases ; the extracted bfs were subsequently smoothed in the phase domain ( the phase step of 0.02 ) in the way described before in @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic lower conjunction of the more massive component occurs during the primary minimum , hence v1191  cyg is a w - type system .",
    "the spectroscopic mass ratio , @xmath29 is consistent with the photometric determination .",
    "the system is , however , very unusual : ( 1 )  it is of a rather late spectral type for such a small mass ratio ; ( 2 )  its mass ratio is unusually small for a w - type system ; ( 3 )  the orbital period is short for the mid - f spectral type implying smaller , more compact components than for typical solar - type contact binaries .",
    "the 2mass color , @xmath30 , corresponds to the f6v spectral type which is exactly what we see in the classification spectra . the tycho-2 color",
    ", @xmath31 is too uncertain to draw any firm conclusions .",
    "the variability of this system was found by the _",
    "hipparcos _ satellite .",
    "it is described there as a periodic variable of an unspecified variability type with the period @xmath32 days .",
    "later @xcite , suggested that it is a contact binary with the orbital period twice the original _ hipparcos _ value .",
    "analysis of photometric observations of the binary is complicated by the rather low amplitude , @xmath33 . in the asas-3 survey @xcite",
    ", the system appears with an undefined variability type and the best period of 21.846 days ; however , the same observations , when phased with the double of the _ hipparcos _ period , show a light curve with the minima of similar depths , a feature which is typical for contact binaries .",
    "rather noisy observations can be found in the nsvs database ( nsvs 11074663 , http://skydot.lanl.gov/nsvs/nsvs.php ) . except for those fragmentary observations , no other photometric or spectroscopic observations of v1003",
    "her are available .",
    "our spectroscopic observations show that v1003  her is indeed a close binary , most likely of the w  uma type , but  because of the very small photometric amplitude  a full description and classification of the system is impossible at this point and would require a high - precision photometry .",
    "the projected total mass of the system , @xmath34 m@xmath35 , the low photometric amplitude , the early spectral type ( a7 ) and the absence of any third light , all indicate a very low inclination angle .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "parallax , @xmath36 mas is of limited use because of its low relative accuracy .",
    "our spectral type estimate , a7v , is consistent with the 2mass infrared color , @xmath4 = 0.234 , but the tycho-2 color index @xmath37 indicates a substantial reddening in the direction to v1003  her , @xmath38 .",
    "variability of bd+7@xmath393142 was detected during the analysis of the asas data @xcite .",
    "it was classified as an eclipsing binary with the following ephemeris : @xmath40 for the primary minima .",
    "no photometric or spectroscopic observations of the system have been published yet .",
    "simultaneous photometry during our spectroscopic observations has led to determination of one light minimum at @xmath41 , which occurred at the phase 0.8366 of the asas prediction .",
    "our spectroscopic conjunction agrees with this newly observed minimum .",
    "the spectroscopic observations show bd+73142 as a triple system with a third component stationary in radial velocities .",
    "the light contribution of the third component is @xmath42 at the brightness maximum of the eclipsing pair ; its signature is narrow with @xmath43 km  s@xmath12 , which is close to the resolution of our spectroscopy .",
    "after approximating the third peak by a gaussian and its removal from the bfs , we obtained well - defined bfs of the eclipsing pair .",
    "the radial velocity of the third component , @xmath44 km  s@xmath12 was found to be close to the center of mass velocity of the eclipsing pair , @xmath45 km  s@xmath12 , hence the third component appears to be a physical member of the system .",
    "the small difference of velocities is , very probably , a result of a slow mutual revolution .",
    "the system is not listed in the wds catalogue as a previously recognized visual double @xcite .",
    "the parallax of the system is unknown , but its absolute visual magnitude can be estimated using calibration of @xcite and the k2 spectral type ( @xmath46 ) at @xmath47 . a correction of the maximum visual magnitude of the combined system , @xmath48 , for the contribution of the third component , results in @xmath49 and then the distance @xmath50 pc .    by combining the proper motion of bd+73142 adopted from the tycho-2 catalogue @xcite with the systemic radial velocity and the estimated distance , one obtains a large space velocity of 88 km  s@xmath12",
    "the 2mass color of bd+7@xmath393142 , @xmath51 , and the tycho-2 @xmath52 agree with our spectral type of k2v and is consistent with the very short period of the system .",
    "the variability of v357  peg ( hd222994 ) was discovered during the _ hipparcos _ mission .",
    "the system was correctly classified as a contact binary .",
    "the first photometry of v357  peg , published by @xcite , shows a typical w  uma - type light curve .",
    "the photometric amplitude is about 0.48 mag so the eclipses can not be far from total ( assuming our @xmath53 ) .",
    "no photometric or spectroscopic study of the system has been published yet in spite of a fairly large brightness of @xmath54 .",
    "our spectroscopic observations show that v357  peg is a contact binary of the a type with the mass ratio of @xmath55 which is moderately large for this type .",
    "the total projected mass of the system @xmath56 is probably not far from the true total mass .",
    "our spectra taken in august and september 2005 showed a dark photospheric spot on the secondary component which became visible just after the secondary minimum ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the main series of observations in 2005 , v357  peg had been shortly observed in 1997 .",
    "these observations do not show any indication of the photospheric spots .",
    "all radial velocities are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , but the 1997 data were not used in orbital solution given in table  [ tab2 ] to avoid any influence of the possibly imprecisely - known or variable period . an orbit based on the 1997 data ( @xmath57 km  s@xmath12 , @xmath58 km  s@xmath12 , @xmath59 km  s@xmath12 , @xmath60 for the spectroscopic conjunction ) is consistent with the 2005 results .",
    "the trigonometric parallax of the system , @xmath61 mas , is too imprecise to determine reliably its absolute magnitude .",
    "our estimate of the spectral type , f2v , agrees with both , the 2mass color , @xmath62 , and the tycho-2 color , @xmath63 .",
    "v407  peg ( bd+14@xmath395016 ; @xmath20 = 9.28 ) was found to be a variable during the semi - automatic variability search program at the piwnice observatory close to toru , poland @xcite .",
    "the authors presented a moderate - precision @xmath64 photometry and the first ephemeris for the primary minima @xmath65 .",
    "the light curve of v407  peg was that of a contact binary .",
    "later @xcite published 13 radial - velocity determinations based on spectra taken at the david dunlap observatory and processed using the bf formalism .",
    "unfortunately , about a half of the available spectra were taken close to the orbital conjunctions making the derived spectroscopic elements ( @xmath66 km  s@xmath12 , @xmath67 km  s@xmath12 and @xmath68 km  s@xmath12 ) rather uncertain and in fact very different from our orbit which is based on 63 spectra .",
    "the most substantial difference is in the 8.7% larger sum of the semi - amplitudes resulting in the 29% larger total ( projected ) mass .",
    "the star was not included in the _ hipparcos _ mission .",
    "its @xmath4 color in the 2mass catalogue @xcite is 0.181 corresponding to the f1 spectral type , which is consistent with the @xmath69 determined by @xcite .",
    "our spectral classification is f0v .",
    "the variability of v1123  tau ( visual double wds  03350 + 1743 ) was discovered during the _ hipparcos _ satellite mission . in the _ hipparcos _ variable stars annex , the star is classified as a @xmath10  lyrae - type eclipsing binary with the ephemeris for the primary minimum : @xmath70 .",
    "the binary is accompanied by a fainter companion ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "the large error of the _ hipparcos _ trigonometric parallax , @xmath74 mas , suggests that it was most likely corrupted by the presence of the visual companion .",
    "@xcite published the first ground - based photometry of the system .",
    "based on the observed color of the system , @xmath75 , the authors estimated the spectral type to be g6v which is much later than our direct classification of g0v .",
    "the rather red color and the wavelength - dependent depths of the minima were very probably a result of the neglected contribution of the late - type companion which was almost certainly entering the diaphragm of the photoelectric photometer .",
    "the third light of the visual companion appears to have caused the amplitudes of the system to be color - dependent : while in the @xmath76 filter the full amplitude of the light curve was 0.413 mag , it was only 0.352 mag in the @xmath77 filter .",
    "the light of the visual companion was partially entering the spectrograph slit during periods of the poor seeing ; it was however marginally visible in the extracted bfs with the relative contribution not larger than typically 0.02  0.03 .",
    "its radial velocity , @xmath78 km  s@xmath12 was constant during our observing run and was fairly close to the center - of - mass velocity of eclipsing pair , @xmath79 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "in addition to the recent observations reported here ( september 2005  march 2007 ) , v1123  tau was also observed in 2002 using the older ccd chip ( see previous papers of this series ) and the 1800 lines / mm grating .",
    "the resulting radial velocities , listed in table  [ tab1 ] , were not used in orbital solution given in table  [ tab2 ] due to the long interval between the two datasets . the orbit based on the 2002 data ( @xmath80 = 24.6 km  s@xmath12",
    ", @xmath81 = 69.3 km  s@xmath12 , @xmath82 = 258.2 km  s@xmath12 , @xmath83 for the spectroscopic conjunction ) is consistent with the results from the new , better - defined data .",
    "the lower conjunction of the more massive component corresponds to the time of the secondary minimum as given in the on - line database of ephemerides of eclipsing binary stars ( see http://www.as.ap.krakow.pl/ephem/ and kreiner , 2004 ) ; therefore v1123  tau is w - type contact binary .",
    "v1128 tau ( visual double wds 03495 + 1255 ) is another _ hipparcos _ discovery .",
    "originally it was classified as a @xmath10  lyrae - type eclipsing binary with the 0.3043732 days orbital period .",
    "the eclipsing pair forms a relatively wide visual double with bd+12511b , separated by 14 arcsec .",
    "the visual companion at the position angle @xmath84 was not entering our spectrograph slit which is permanently oriented in the e - w direction .",
    "the high - precision photometry of @xcite showed that the system is a totally eclipsing contact binary , with the totality lasting about 16 minutes .",
    "a subsequent light curve modeling led to @xmath85 and the high orbital inclination angle of @xmath86 degrees .",
    "the light curve asymmetry , with the maximum following the primary minimum being brighter , was interpreted in terms of a cool spot on the cooler component .",
    "our spectroscopic mass ratio , @xmath87 , is in a reasonable but not perfect consistency with the photometric estimate .",
    "however , we could not see any evidence of dark photospheric spots on either of the components in our bfs .",
    "the lower conjunction of the more massive component coincides with the deeper eclipse so that v1128  tau is definitely a w - type contact binary .",
    "in addition to our recent observations reported here ( december 2005  march 2007 ) , v1128  tau had been shortly observed in 1997 and in 2003 using the old ccd detector and the 1800 lines / mm grating .",
    "the resulting radial velocities , listed in table  [ tab1 ] , were not used in orbital solution given in table  [ tab2 ] . the corresponding orbit",
    "( @xmath80 = @xmath8814.5 km  s@xmath12 , @xmath81 = 127.1 km  s@xmath12 , @xmath82 = 243.4 km  s@xmath12 , @xmath89 for the spectroscopic conjunction ) is consistent with the results from the new data .",
    "the presence of the visual companion to the contact binary makes the _ hipparcos _ parallax , @xmath90 mas , rather uncertain ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is a disparity between @xmath91 , as determined from the 2mass survey , implying a spectral type later than g6v and our spectral type estimate , f8v ; this disparity is probably caused by the late - type visual companion .",
    "the photometric variability of hh  uma was discovered by the _ hipparcos _",
    "mission where it was classified as a periodic variable with @xmath92 days . on the basis of the color ",
    "period relation , @xcite concluded that it is very probably a genuine contact binary with twice the _ hipparcos _ period .",
    "the ground - based observations of @xcite supported the contact binary nature of hh  uma ; they also gave an improved ephemeris : @xmath93 .",
    "due to the partial eclipses , the mass ratio could not be reliably determined and was estimated as @xmath94 .",
    "our spectroscopy definitely shows a contact - binary nature of hh  uma and gives @xmath95 .",
    "the low projected total mass , @xmath96 , together with low amplitude of the light curve , 0.17 mag , support the low inclination angle , as found in the photometric analysis .",
    "the trigonometric parallax of the system , @xmath97 mas , is too imprecise to draw any conclusions on its absolute magnitude .",
    "the 2mass color of the system , @xmath98 , agrees fairly well with our estimate of the spectral type , f5v .",
    "the tycho-2 @xmath99 corresponds to the f7v spectral type .",
    "py  vir ( gsc 4961 - 667 ) was found on stardial images to be a variable of the w  uma type @xcite .",
    "the system is also known as an x - ray source ( 1rxs j131032.4 - 040934 ) .",
    "no photometric or spectroscopic analysis of py  vir has been published yet .",
    "a minimum observed photometrically in parallel with the spectroscopic observations ( @xmath100 ) was used for a preliminary improvement of the ephemeris used for phasing of our spectroscopy .",
    "the broadening functions of py  vir based on the 2007 observations show the presence of a third component with a constant radial velocity , @xmath101 km  s@xmath12 ; this velocity is rather different from the systemic velocity of the contact binary , @xmath102 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "a few additional , low quality spectra of py  vir taken in poor - weather conditions on february 19 , 2008 ( not listed in table  [ tab1 ] ) give @xmath103 km  s@xmath12 ( at the mean hjd = 2454515.883 ) so that we have an indication of a change in @xmath104 .",
    "the velocities of the close binary from these additional observations are not precise enough to see if the motion of the third component is reflected in systemic radial velocity of the eclipsing pair .",
    "the third component may be a binary itself ; otherwise , the velocity changes may result from its low mass and a relatively fast orbital motion in a tight triple system .",
    "we consider the latter possibility as a relatively probable and more exciting one , but its verification would require observations over several seasons .",
    "py  vir has not been known to be a multiple system ; it is also not listed in the wds catalogue .",
    "a lunar occultation of the system in july 1984 did not reveal presence of any visual companion @xcite , hence the separation of components is probably very small .",
    "moreover , the light contribution of the third component is fairly small , only about @xmath105 , at the maximum light of the eclipsing pair .",
    "the 2mass color of the system , @xmath98 , indicates the k2v spectral type , which is consistent with our spectral classification .",
    "the orbital period of the system , 0.311 days , is rather long for such a late spectral type ( it would be more consistent with late f ) so that the system may be close but detached .",
    "the shape of the broadening function ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) with a gap between the two peaks is not inconsistent with this possibility .",
    "the tycho-2 @xmath2 color is rather uncertain to draw any conclusions , @xmath106 .",
    "with the new ten short - period binaries , this paper brings the number of the systems studied at the david dunlap observatory to 120 .",
    "almost all systems of this group have been rather neglected and little has been known about them .",
    "the highlights of this series are : ( 1 )  the triple systems bd+7@xmath393142 and py  vir , both with short - period , late spectral - type ( k2v ) binaries ; ( 2 )  both of the above are interesting : bd+7@xmath393142 is a high space - velocity system while py  vir maybe a very close , but detached binary ; ( 3 )  the spotted contact binary , v1128  tau , with a large spot on the secondary component , ( 4 )  v1191  cyg , the unusual , w - type contact binary with the small mass ratio of 0.107 and a relatively short - period , observed during the rapid mass - transfer stage .",
    "v1191  cyg has an unexpectedly short orbital period for its f6v spectral type implying smaller components than for typical solar - composition , solar - age contact binaries ; this may be an indication of its old population characteristics , similar to those of binaries in globular clusters @xcite .",

    "<S> radial - velocity measurements and sine - curve fits to the orbital radial velocity variations are presented for ten close binary systems : eg  cep , v1191  cyg , v1003  her , bd+73142 , v357  peg , v407  peg , v1123  tau , v1128  tau , hh  uma , and py  vir . </S>",
    "<S> while most of the studied eclipsing systems are contact binaries , eg  cep is a detached or a semi - detached double - lined binary and v1003  her is a close binary of an uncertain type seen at a very low inclination angle . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered two previously unknown triple systems , bd+73142 and py  vir , both with late spectral - type ( k2v ) binaries . </S>",
    "<S> of interest is the low - mass ratio ( @xmath0 ) close binary v1191  cyg showing an extremely fast period increase ; the system has a very short period for its spectral type and shows a w - type light curve , a feature rather unexpected for such a low mass - ratio system . </S>"
