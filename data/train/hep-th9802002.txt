    "in 1988 witten proposed a description of donaldson s theory ( `` topological '' invariants of four - dimensional manifolds ) in terms of an appropriately twisted @xmath0 susy su(2 ) pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "but not so many mathematical consequences have followed from this approach until 1994 . since 1994",
    "we have witnessed a new ( second ) `` revolution '' in this fascinating area at the border of quantum field theory and topology known under the name of ( topological ) seiberg - witten ( sw ) theory .",
    "it has appeared that a newly - discovered dual description of the @xmath0 theory in low - energy limit @xcite provides us a new , alternative ( but essentially equivalent and simpler ) formulation of invariants of four - dimensional manifolds @xcite .",
    "it would be greatly interesting and natural to investigate a presumably analogous situation in three dimensions . and",
    "this is the aim of our present work .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "a physical scenario has been proposed to reach our present goal using a geometric - topological construction with scalar curvature distribution `` compatible '' with surgery .",
    "though the scalar curvature distribution used `` agrees '' with the surgery procedure , nevertheless it is unclear why such a distribution should be privileged .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , we propose a simpler and more natural mechanism without any reference to curvature .",
    "in fact , we directly apply known results concerning low - energy limit of 3d @xmath1 susy u(1 ) gauge theory with matter field @xcite .",
    "in three dimensions ( 3d ) , we have the two important topological quantum field theories ( of `` cohomological '' type ) : topological su(2 ) gauge theory of flat connection and 3d version of the ( topological ) sw theory .",
    "the former is a 3d twisted @xmath1 susy su(2 ) pure gauge theory or a 3d version of the donaldson - witten ( dw ) theory , and `` by definition '' it describes the casson invariant , which appropriately counts the number of flat su(2 ) connections @xcite .",
    "the latter is a 3d twisted version of @xmath1 susy u(1 ) gauge theory with a matter hypermultiplet @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also this theory should describe an interesting non - trivial topological invariant of 3d manifolds pertaining to sw invariant which was conjectured to be equivalent to the casson invariant ( and thus to the former theory ) or to topological torsion .",
    "the first conjecture is physically strongly motivated by the fact that the both theories can be derived from 4d @xmath0 susy su(2 ) pure gauge theory corresponding via twist to dw theory .",
    "the second one is a mathematical result @xcite .",
    "this equivalence would be a 3d counterpart of the equivalence of 4d dw and sw theories .",
    "the latter being a `` low - energy version '' of the former . in this paper , using physical arguments , we will show that topological contents of 3d sw theory is basically equivalent to an abelian version of the casson invariant ( of infinite covering space @xmath2 ) . in turn",
    ", the abelian casson invariant will appear to be equivalent to the alexander `` polynomial '' of the manifold @xmath3 itself ( see , also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , as follows from mathematical literature the alexander invariant is related to the ( non - abelian ) casson invariant as well as to topological torsion @xcite .",
    "the 3d manifold we are interested in , @xmath3 , is obtained from the 3d sphere @xmath4 via 0-surgery on a knot .    to determine the dual description of sw topological invariants of the 3d manifold @xmath3 we will make use of known results pertaining to the corresponding physical ( untwisted ) theory .",
    "the corresponding physical theory is 3d @xmath1 susy u(1 ) gauge theory with a single ( monopole ) matter hypermultiplet .",
    "its low - energy limit has been determined by seiberg and witten in @xcite .",
    "the theory has only the coulomb branch ( there is no higgs branch for one monopole field ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the moduli space of the theory is everywhere smooth , and the monopole is nowhere massless .",
    "thus , in low - energy limit , we deal with @xmath1 susy u(1 ) pure gauge theory , i.e.  3d ( super)electrodynamics . in topological sector ( upon twisting ) , we obtain a theory of flat u(1 ) connection . at first sight , the theory could only trivially detect the first cohomology of @xmath3 ( not a very exciting quantity ) .",
    "but happily , this is not the case as the dual of the photon assumes values on a circle @xmath5 rather than on @xmath6 @xcite , and in the case of non - simply - connected manifolds the topological theory begins to live on the infinite covering space @xmath2 of the original manifold @xmath3 , where the dual photon field would be a multivalued function .",
    "therefore , actually we measure the first ( co)homology of @xmath2 ( the alexander invariant ) , rather than the trivial one of @xmath3 . and",
    "more precisely , we count the number of u(1 ) connections on @xmath2 .    that way , in topological sector",
    ", the theory has switched from measuring the first cohomology of @xmath3 to measuring the first cohomology of its infinite cover , @xmath2 . in other words , upon twisting , we have an abelian `` cohomological '' theory on @xmath2 . the partition function",
    "@xmath7 of our theory should `` ordinarily '' , i.e. without sign ( due to abelianity ) , count the number of ( inequivalent ) u(1)-representations of the fundamental group @xmath8 of @xmath2 @xmath9 eq .",
    "( 1 ) defines an abelian analogue of the ( standard ) casson invariant .",
    "our temporary conclusion says that the partition function @xmath7 of 3d sw theory describes the abelian casson invariant @xmath10 of @xmath2 .",
    "formula ( 1 ) is a counterpart of an analogous formula for topological field theory of flat su(2 ) connection .",
    "now , we should translate the invariant of @xmath2 to a , possibly already known , topological invariant of @xmath3 . to this end",
    ", we will `` explicitly calculate '' the number of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "first of all , since u(1 ) is an abelian group a non - abelian part of @xmath8 drops out , and effectively we deal with an equivalent but simpler expression , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an integer - valued first homology group ( @xmath14 $ ] ) .",
    "we claim that @xmath10 is the alexander `` polynomial '' understood as a determinant @xmath15 where the matrix @xmath16 `` describes '' the homology of @xmath2 @xmath17 for @xmath18some homology basis ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "now , we should pass to a u(1 ) representation of ( 4 ) .",
    "if @xmath19 then for lhs of ( 4 ) we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 , for uniqueness .",
    "rhs of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is now @xmath22 a new , u(1 ) version of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is then @xmath23 by virtue of ( 2 ) , @xmath10 is the number of solutions of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , i.e.  the number of different @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath24 are integer - valued points in a parallelepiped spanned by the `` base vectors '' @xmath25 .",
    "one can observe that the number of @xmath26 s is equal to the number of points inside the parallelepiped with integer coordinates and thus to the volume of that parallelepiped , which in turn , is equal to the determinant of @xmath27 .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a physical scenario describing 3d topological sw theory in terms of the `` alexander polynomial '' ( 3 ) of the 3d manifold @xmath3 obtained via 0-surgery on a knot .",
    "this dual , `` low - energy '' description of 3d topology directly follows from the corresponding facts concerning physical 3d @xmath1 susy u(1 ) gauge theory with matter .",
