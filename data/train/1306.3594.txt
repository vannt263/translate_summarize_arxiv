    "one of the oldest problems in physics is that of determining the motion of @xmath0 bodies under a specified mutual force . commonly referred to as the @xmath0-body problem , it occurs frequently in many distinct subfields and remains an active area of research .  when the specified interaction is gravitation the problem is particularly interesting , partly because of obvious astrophysical applications and partly because some basic issues in the statistical behaviour of such systems are still not well - understood .",
    "one - dimensional self - gravitating systems ( ogs s ) continue to play an important role in this regard .  even in the simplified setting of one spatial dimension ,",
    "there are still many open questions about the ogs concerning its ergodic behaviour , the conditions ( if any ) under which equipartition of energy is attained , and whether or not it can reach a true equilibrium configuration from arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , even for non - relativistic ( newtonian ) gravity , ogs s have proven to be very useful in modeling many diverse physical systems .",
    "stable core - halo structures have been shown to exist in the ogs phase - space that are reminiscent of those found in globular clusters @xcite , in which a dense core of particles near equilibrium are surrounded by a cloud of particles with high kinetic energy that interact very weakly with the core .",
    "the ogs also models the motion of stars interacting with a highly flattened galaxy @xcite  and the dynamics of flat , parallel sheets colliding along a perpendicular axis @xcite . a preliminary study of the relativistic case yielded a complete derivation of the partition and single - particle distribution functions in both the canonical and microcanonical ensembles to leading order in a post - newtonian expansion @xcite .",
    "recently non - relativistic ogs s have been shown to exhibit a new phase of evolution in which fractal spatial structure emerges from non - fractal initial conditions @xcite .    even for small values of @xmath0 , ogs s exhibit interesting novel behaviour and model interesting physical systems .",
    "the 3-body ogs is equivalent to a system of two elastically colliding billiard balls in a uniform , gravitational field @xcite , as well as to a bound state of three quarks to form a `` linear baryon '' @xcite .",
    "it can be extended to fully include relativistic gravitational interactions @xcite , and investigations have been carried out for both the equal mass @xcite and unequal mass @xcite cases .",
    "furthermore , it is isomorphic to a system in which a billiard elastically collides with a wedge of fixed angle in a uniform , gravitational field @xcite .  as such , one can study the 3-body ogs ( non - relativistically and relativistically ) by studying the motion of a single particle moving in two spatial dimensions in a specified potential .",
    "the motion in this case is readily visualizable , and the different types of motion can be classified into three categories : annulus , where each particle always crosses the other two in succession ; pretzel , in which two particles cross each other at least twice in a row before either crosses the third ; and chaotic , where the sequence of particle crossings does not progress in a discernible pattern .    in this paper",
    "we carry out an investigation of the 4-body ogs .",
    "analogous to its 3-body counterpart , this system is isomorphic to the motion of a single particle moving in three spatial dimensions in a specified potential",
    ". consequently the 4-body case is of particular interest in that it is the largest value of @xmath0 for which the motion of the system can be directly visualized @xcite ) .",
    "we consider only the non - relativistic case ( which to our knowledge has never been studied ) , leaving the relativistic case for future work .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with an overview of the problem of 4-body motion in newtonian gravity , and describe a general classification we then close our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional newtonian gravity , the hamiltonian of our system of particles is given by : @xmath2 which is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles and the potential interactions between them .",
    "the gravitational potential is determined from @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass density of the system , here modeled as a set of four point particles .",
    "in one spatial dimension the solution to this equation is @xmath5 and the potential is given by @xmath6 .",
    "_ _  _ _ the equations of motion are given by : @xmath7    since the momentum is conserved and since the potential depends only on the separations between the particles , there are actually only six _ independent _ degrees of freedom in the 4-body system : the three separations between the particles and their conjugate momenta .",
    "this is easily seen by making the following convenient change of coordinates @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the conjugate momenta are given by @xmath10 where we have set @xmath11 by conservation of momentum .",
    "without loss of generality the centre of mass of the system can be fixed at the origin .",
    "@xcite    in the equal mass case the hamiltonian ( [ newtham ] ) becomes @xmath12\\label{hamnew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the hamiltonian of a single particle moving in three spatial dimensions in a linear potential whose shape is that of a 3-simplex .",
    "in general a the @xmath0 particle ogs can be mapped to a single particle moving in @xmath13 dimensions in a linear potential whose equipotential surfaces are that of an @xmath13 simplex .",
    "as such , the 4-body ogs is the largest system for which the motion can be directly visualized",
    ".  we shall refer to the form ( [ hamnew ] ) as the hamiltonian of the box - particle .    using this result , plot the potential in the equal mass case from equation ( [ hamnew ] ) , defined as    @xmath14    which can be drawn in @xmath15  space as shown in figure [ fig : potential ] .",
    "an equipotential surface is that of a cube of pyramid - shaped sides .  a cross - section of this surface through any of the edges of one of these pyramids yields a hexagon whose sides are not all of equal length .",
    "this is reflective of the fact that on such cross - sections the problem reduces to that of the three - body problem with unequal masses @xcite  since two particles occupy the same position .    .",
    "larger values of @xmath16 will produce larger scaled `` boxes '' . ]",
    "we turn now to the problem of solving the equations of motion ( [ newtmot ] ) . as there are no singularities in the potential whenever two particles cross ,",
    "we assume that the particles pass through each other freely upon collision .  prior to any collision , solving the equations is trivial : since the acceleration of each particle is constant at any given instant , the trajectory of each particle is a quadratic function of time .",
    "however after each subsequent crossing the acceleration of a given particle changes its magnitude , since the number of bodies to the right and left of it have changed .",
    "hence an analytic closed - form solution to the equations of motion ( [ newtmot ] ) is completely impractical .",
    "we therefore solve the equations of motion numerically , using a matlab ode(ordinary differential equation )  routine to integrate the equations of motion ( [ newtmot ] ) .  for the most part the standard `` ode45 '' routine proved to be completely sufficient for our needs .",
    "in some cases we also used the `` ode113 '' routine because of ou    to perform the numerical analysis we rescale the variables to have dimensionless values @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total mass of the system and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the dimensionless momenta and positions respectively .",
    "the dimensionless mass and hamiltonian are : @xmath21 using the dimensionless variables in ( [ unitrescale1 ] ) and ( [ unitrescale2 ] ) , the hamiltonian ( [ newtham ] ) becomes : @xmath22 as for the equations of motion ( [ newtmot ] ) one gets : @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath1    a time step in the numerical code has a value @xmath25 .",
    "all the numerical calculations were carried out using the rescaled variables ( [ unitrescale1 ] ) .",
    "henceforth we drop all of the `` hats '' of the dimensionless variables for convenience .    note",
    "that since the energy is a constant of the motion , we could further rescale all quantities in terms of @xmath26 , thereby fixing this final redundant scale",
    ". however we shall find it convenient to employ the above rescalings , as it affords us more freedom in choosing initial conditions .",
    "prior to any collision between the particles the evolution of the system is straightforward : each particle moves with a constant acceleration that is proportional to the difference between the total mass on its right and left sides .",
    "however after a collision , where we assume that the particles pass through each other , the mass difference changes , and with it the accelerations of the particles .",
    "it is these repeated changes in the accelerations of the particles that yield the interesting dynamics of the system .     from the perspective of the box particle ,",
    "such crossings correspond to the box particle crossing any plane that bisects the 3-simplex through its vertices and edges , yielding a discontinuous change in the box particle s acceleration .",
    "these planes occur in pairs whose line of intersection is along each of the three principal axes , for a total of six such planes .",
    "their equations are given by setting any one of the six quantities in eq .",
    "( [ changevar1 ] ) to zero , and each plane corresponds to the crossing of a pair of particles . for example @xmath27",
    "corresponds to the crossing of particles 1 and 2 , whereas @xmath28  corresponds to the crossing of particles 2 and 4 .",
    "initially we have all of the crossings listed in order as a string of vanishing quantities .",
    "the direction of crossing is irrelevant ; for example 1 crossing 2 is equivalent to 2 crossing 1 .  at any given instant we can fix the positions of particles in a certain order from left to right , i.e. @xmath30 , in which case we only have 3 possible crossings :  @xmath31 .",
    "we denote these using the braid operators @xmath32 , with @xmath33  corresponding to an interchange between the right - most pair of particles , @xmath34  for the middle pair and @xmath35  for the left - most pair .",
    "more generally , instead of defining the actual particles as @xmath36 , we define the positions as that sequence : the left - most particle is at position @xmath37 , next @xmath38 , and so on with the right - most particle being at position @xmath0 . given any sequence of particle crossings",
    ", we can employ braid group notation @xcite to classify the motion , denoting pair crossings with the set @xmath39 .",
    "for example the sequence @xmath40  is described by @xmath41 , and the initial configuration @xmath30  becomes the final configuration @xmath42 .  since crossing direction",
    "is irrelevant , the reciprocal notation for the braid group is ignored ( i.e. @xmath43  in this context ) .",
    "we are now ready to classify the distinct kinds of motion that can occur .",
    "consider first the 3-body case .",
    "this problem can be mapped to that of a single particle moving in a hexagonal - shaped well , with the bisectors of the hexagon denoting pair - crossings of the particles @xcite . in this case",
    "we have @xmath44  as the braid operators .",
    "for any string of these we can classify the motion in the equal mass case as follows :    @xmath45    by comparing subsequent items in the string ; we have included the @xmath46 descriptors employed previously in 3-body studies @xcite .  in other words , since crossing direction is irrelevant , the only interesting types of motion are when the same pair of particles crosses twice in a row ( @xmath47-motion ) corresponding to crossing a single bisector of the hexagon twice in succession , or when one particle crosses each of its compatriots in succession ( @xmath48-motion ) corresponding to the crossing of two successive bisectors .  in the unequal mass case",
    "the hexagon is no longer symmetric , and so @xmath49 , say , is now distinguishable from @xmath50 .",
    "however one could impose an equivalence relation between these two motions and continue to employ the above notation .",
    "any given motion in the system can be characterized by a sequence of letters @xmath47  and @xmath48  ( called a symbol sequence ) , with a finite exponent @xmath51  denoting @xmath51-repeats and an over - bar denoting an infinite repeated sequence .",
    "this idea extends naturally to the 4-body system .",
    "here the braid operators are @xmath32 .",
    "we can construct the following definitions :    @xmath52        whose results can be visualized in figure [ fig:4body_motion_class ] .",
    "the @xmath47  and @xmath48  motions still represent the same physical situations as in the 3-body case .",
    "however there is now a new type of motion : @xmath53  motion , which is when two particles cross one another and then the other two cross one another .",
    "we can proceed further , generalizing our arguments and definitions to the @xmath0-body case and make a more formal definition of our motion classes whose specific cases for @xmath54  and @xmath55  will be equivalent to what we have described above .    to describe crossings of @xmath0  particles for a specific trajectory we have the braid operators @xmath56 .",
    "a sequence of @xmath57  pair crossings will be described by    @xmath58    where @xmath59  for all @xmath60  is a discrete integer function  .",
    "here  @xmath61  means that the particles currently in positions @xmath62  and @xmath63  cross .",
    "any given sequence of @xmath57  braid operators forms a unique ordered list of crossings for the given trajectory .",
    "as stated previously , crossing directions are irrelevant .",
    "now we define a new function    @xmath64    using the finite forward difference function of @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the absolute difference between subsequent terms , and thus we have @xmath66  for all @xmath67  now @xmath68defines a metric that describes the relative `` distance '' between any pair of crossings , and we classify the motion according to this distance     @xmath69    denoting each type by increasing letters of the alphabet . in other words , @xmath47-motion corresponds to any 2 crossings in nearest proximity  two particles cross each other twice in succession",
    ".  @xmath48-motion corresponds to any 2 crossings in next - nearest proximity  two particles cross each other , and then one of them crosses its other nearest neighbour .",
    "@xmath53-motion corresponds to any 2 crossings in next - to - next - nearest proximity : two particles cross each other and then a neighbouring pair cross each other .",
    "we can continue on in this fashion until we reach the extreme case in which the right - most pair of particles cross one another followed by the crossing of the left - most pair ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "we illustrate this classification with some examples . for @xmath54",
    ", we have @xmath70 .",
    "suppose we have a crossing sequence @xmath71 , yielding from ( [ 3bodymotions ] ) the symbol sequence @xmath72 . by our definition",
    "above we have    @xmath73    and from ( [ braiddiffmotions ] ) we get @xmath72  as we expected .  for @xmath55 , we have @xmath74 .",
    "consider the previous example @xmath41 , which from ( [ 4bodymotions ] ) yields the symbol sequence @xmath75 , the same result we would obtain from computing successive values of @xmath68  ( which are @xmath76  for this example ) .",
    "the preceding classification system is limited to pair - wise crossings and does not cover situations in which more than one pair of particles crosses at the exact same time step .",
    "while the braid group notation does allow for multiple collisions by writing them `` left - to - right '' , it is important in our system whether or not these collisions occur at the same time step .  for the @xmath0-body problem ,",
    "a simultaneous collision of @xmath57  particles corresponds to the crossing of a single particle through an @xmath77-dimensional surface in the interior of the @xmath78  simplex .",
    "this surface is obtained by continually bisecting the simplex along its ( higher - dimesional ) edges and vertices until the surface of appropriate dimensionality is obtained .",
    "we can denote such collisions by extending the braid group notation with the set @xmath79 , where the subscript denotes which set of particles is involved , beginning with the left - most , and the superscript ( on these subscripts ) denotes the number of particles in the collision .",
    "for example @xmath80  denotes a 7-particle collision that involves particles 9 - 15 .",
    "we shall drop the superscript `` 2 '' when pair - wise collisions are involved .",
    "all collisions yield crossings except for the situation in which the initial conditions cause @xmath57  particles to occupy the same point throughout the motion .  in this latter case",
    "the system reduces to that of an ( unequal mass ) @xmath81-body problem .    of course for the 3 and 4-body cases the numbers of multiple collisions are simple .",
    "there is a single type of multiple collision in the 3-body case , which occurs when the hex particle crosses the origin .  in the 4-body case",
    "we can have two kinds of 3-body collisions ( described by  @xmath82 ) that occur when the box particle crosses the line of intersection of any two bisecting planes of the 3-simplexes .",
    "we also have two kinds of 4-body collisions  ( described by @xmath83 ) .",
    "the former occurs when two pairs of particles cross each other at the same time , and corresponds to the box particle crossing one of the three lines connecting opposite vertices of the pyramids in the simplex  ( see figure [ fig : potential ] ) .",
    "the latter is when all four particles cross at once , equivalent to the  box particle crossing the origin .",
    "in this section we consider the equal - mass case .",
    "we study the behaviour of the four - body system using a variety of initial conditions , and compare to the 3-body case @xcite where relevant .",
    "many patterns of motion in the 3-body system have natural counterparts in the 4-body case .",
    "a necessary check on the code is to see if we can reproduce results in the 3-body case .  indeed , if _ one _ of the box - particle s position _ and _ momentum coordinates is initially zero it will remain zero throughout the motion , and the motion of the box - particle will be restricted to a plane .",
    "this corresponds to the situation mentioned near the end of the previous section , as is easily shown . from the hamiltonian",
    "( [ hamnew ] ) , the equations of motion for the @xmath84 coordinate is completely arbitrary ; we could have chosen @xmath85 or @xmath4 equivalently . ]",
    "are : @xmath86\\label{padot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath87 so if the initial conditions are @xmath88 and @xmath89 , then we have clearly from eq.([adot ] ) that @xmath90for all @xmath91 , which implies that eq.([padot ] ) becomes @xmath92\\notag\\\\   & = & 0\\label{padot2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so the motion is restricted to the @xmath93 plane . similarly , it is not difficult to convince oneself that the box - particle is also restricted to the @xmath94 plane when the initial momentum and position @xmath95 and @xmath4 are both zero , and to the @xmath96 plane when @xmath97 and @xmath85 are initially both zero .",
    "note , however , that even if there is no momentum along @xmath84 initially , it does not mean that the particles will never move in the @xmath84 direction .  indeed if the initial position @xmath98",
    ", then the particle will acquire momentum according to eq.([padot ] ) .",
    "consequently we should recover all of the patterns of motion that the hex particle exhibits in the 3-body case @xcite for the subset of initial conditions in which  @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we found this to be the case , and recovered the annulus , pretzel and chaotic motions referred to in the introduction .",
    "figure [ fig : beg_2d ] illustrates some examples belonging to the first and second classes . * *  * * note that this is not an equal - mass 3-body system , but rather one with unequal masses , because the two particles that are moving together are like one single particle with a mass twice as large .",
    "indeed , two trajectories ( out of four ) are exactly identical , which means that two particles are moving together .    .",
    "the initial conditions for the plots on the left are : @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath85 will be calculated so that eq .",
    "( [ hamnew ] ) is satisfied initially .",
    "the initial conditions for the plots on the right are :  @xmath103 @xmath100 @xmath104 @xmath102 @xmath89 . ]",
    "similarly , it is not surprising that we recover the two - body case if we choose _ two _ momentum and position coordinates to be zero initially .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 , then the box - particle will move on a line parallel to the @xmath85-axis .  in this case , the @xmath109 plots show only two distinguishable trajectories , because we have actually two pairs of particles moving .  unlike the reduction to the three - body case from the equal mass four - body problem",
    ", we have here a reduction to an equal mass two - body problem .",
    "of course the more interesting situation is when there is motion in all spatial directions , generating three - dimensional patterns .",
    "changing the initial conditions a little bit from those used for the plots shown in figure [ fig : beg_2d ] by giving , for example , a small momentum along the @xmath84 direction gives us the three - dimensional trajectories ( figure [ fig : beg_3d ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , these patterns are direct generalizations of what we observed in figure [ fig : beg_2d ] , since the motion in the @xmath84 direction simply perturbs the patterns previously obtained in the @xmath110 plane when we set @xmath88 and @xmath111 , initially .",
    "essentially the original hex - particle patterns develop a `` thickness '' in the @xmath84 direction .    .",
    "the initial conditions for the plots on the left are : @xmath99 @xmath112 @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath89 . ]    for the three - dimensional annulus , we  chose initial conditions to show that a non - zero @xmath113 induces a non - zero @xmath114 , even if @xmath115 .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the peaks of figure [ fig : beg_2d ] with those of figure [ fig : beg_3d ] .",
    "we see that the three - dimensional trajectories experience a small deviation ( near the peak ) in the trajectories of the two particles that were exactly the same for the two - dimensional box - particle trajectories .",
    "the more we increase the value of the initial conditions @xmath113 or @xmath116 the bigger the deviation , and in the @xmath15 space , the particle will have a larger amplitude in the @xmath84 direction .",
    "to further investigate the trajectories that can be obtained in the full three - dimensional case , we follow the method in @xcite - that is using initial condition constraints of _ fixed - energy _",
    "( fe )  and of _ fixed - momentum _ ( fm).initial values for @xmath117 and @xmath97 , adjusting @xmath118 using the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamnew ] ) , and check that @xmath119 remains at its initial value throughout the motion ( figures [ fig : beg_2d ] , [ fig : beg_3d ] , [ fig : ann_pretz ] , [ fig:2d_pretz_poinc ] , [ fig : odd_shape ] , [ fig : nice_poinc ] ) .",
    "we have chosen to vary @xmath118 , to more easily facilitate comparison with the previous results in the equal - mass 3-body case @xcite .",
    "similarly for the fixed - momenta case , we will choose @xmath120 and @xmath118 while allowing @xmath119 to vary as the initial conditions vary .",
    "we imposed error tolerances on the matlab ode  routine and checked that the total energy of the system remained constant throughout the motion for any given set of initial conditions .",
    "since we were using an improved version of the code , we were able to get the error down to @xmath121 in most cases , and always less than @xmath122 .",
    "as noted above , small perturbations of the three - body case yield three - dimensional trajectories that usually have a nice shape similar to that of the three - body case if projected onto one of the planes @xmath123 or @xmath124 .  however , the third axis is generally just a periodic oscillation with no real pattern relative to the other axes , as in figure [ fig : ann_mess ] .",
    "this trajectory s motion is characterized by the symbol sequence @xmath125 .    *",
    "*     plane , the plot is much more random in the @xmath124 plane , although one can still observe a semi - periodic pattern .",
    "the bottom - left isometric plot of the trajectory shows that the periods of oscillation in the various axes do not line up nicely for these initial conditions .",
    "the bottom - right plot show the four particle positions vs. time * * ; * * the symbol sequence is * *  * * @xmath125 . ]",
    "plane , the plot is much more random in the @xmath124 plane , although one can still observe a semi - periodic pattern .",
    "the bottom - left isometric plot of the trajectory shows that the periods of oscillation in the various axes do not line up nicely for these initial conditions .",
    "the bottom - right plot show the four particle positions vs. time * * ; * * the symbol sequence is * *  * * @xmath125 . ]",
    "however , cases where these periods do line up can be obtained with carefully chosen initial conditions .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : ann_pretz ] shows a trajectory that has a pretzel form when projected onto two of the planes ( @xmath126  and @xmath127 ) , and an annulus when projected onto the third ( @xmath124 ) .  the three - dimensional isometric ( in which there is no perspective so that objects further away do _ not _ appear smaller ) view shows a periodic three - dimensional path - a qualitatively new feature that has no analogue in the 3-body system .",
    "the motion here is described by @xmath128 , which is very similar    . in this case",
    "however , we see that from every direction the trajectory forms a recognizable two - dimensional plot ( third direction is not shown , but it is a pretzel similar to the top - left ) .  since the periods of the motions in various axes are compatible in this case , we see from the isometric plot ( middle - left ) that a fully three - dimensional periodic trajectory exists .",
    "note that fe ( @xmath129 )  constraints were used in this case for conve ]    . in this case",
    "however , we see that from every direction the trajectory forms a recognizable two - dimensional plot ( third direction is not shown , but it is a pretzel similar to the top - left ) .",
    "since the periods of the motions in various axes are compatible in this case , we see from the isometric plot ( middle - left ) that a fully three - dimensional periodic trajectory exists .",
    "note that fe ( @xmath129 )  constraints were used in this case for conve ]    to give an even better idea of the types of paths that can be obtained with compatible periods , another example is shown in figure [ fig : ann_pretz_2 ] .",
    "the symbol sequence for this trajectory is similar to the other example in that it contains mostly sets of @xmath130  and @xmath131 ; however @xmath132also shows up occasionally .",
    "suffice it to say that many interesting trajectories can be obtained , although most are generalizations of the three - body case , as seen in the previous section , or are simply chaotic .",
    "as expected we find that the latter case produces the same type of dense orbits in three - dimensions as its 3-body counterpart did in two .",
    "we will now focus our attention on the various special cases that we can attain by starting particles very close to one another .",
    "for example , we can put two sets of two particles together , and we expect those two to repeatedly cross one another , while on average the two pairs behave as a equal - mass two body system .",
    "similarly we could put three particles very close together and one separate .    from this and the fact that we have equal masses we will consider six initial configurations :  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 , 2 + 2 , 3 + 1 , 2 + 1 + 1 , 1 + 2 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 2 , where `` a+b+c ''  notation indicates the relative size of the initial @xmath133  values , with largest at the left and smallest at the right ; a number larger than unity indicates that the difference between the @xmath133-values of these particles is small relative to all other spacings .",
    "for example , `` 2 + 1 + 1 '' denotes that we have a pair of particles starting close together ( relative to the other spacings ) with the greatest @xmath133  values , and two independent ( far apart ) particles with the lower two @xmath133  values .  strictly speaking the 1 + 1 + 2 and 2 + 1 + 1 cases",
    "are symmetric ( equal masses ) and indeed they produce similar plots as we will see .    for each of these possible cases , we construct plots of  the box - particle in @xmath15 space and the associated plot of particle positions on the line .",
    "the easiest way to find suitable initial conditions is to use ( [ changevar1 ] ) to choose @xmath134 and @xmath84 so that we get suitable particle starting positions , and set the momenta to zero .",
    "thus we use the fixed - momenta conditions and allow @xmath119 to vary .",
    "only one angle of the @xmath15 plots is shown , though the captions describe them in more detail .",
    "figure [ fig:1_1_1_1 ] shows the case where the four particles begin spaced at equal unit spacing with no momentum .",
    "predictably they are all drawn together and cross at the same point , continuing this pattern indefinitely .  since all four particles always ` collide ' at the same time step",
    ", the symbol sequence in terms of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath53  is undefined .",
    "instead the motion reduces to that of a single body of mass @xmath135  the box particle travels back and forth along a line in @xmath15space , with all particles simultaneously crossing at the origin .",

    "the four particles repeatedly come very close together before executing near parabolic motion about the centre of mass .  however after about 80 time steps the trajectory degenerates into chaos .",
    "while the paired particles remain bound , they eventually fall out of the parabolic motion and begin to move chaotically with respect to the other particles .",
    "no pattern is obvious in the symbol sequence .",
    "we will now examine the poincare plots of these trajectories in the newtonian system .",
    "unfortunately , this turns out to be much more difficult in the four - body case than it was in the three - body .",
    "the reason is that in the three - body system , the poincare plots were a collection of points in two - dimensions @xcite , while in the four - body system they are a collection of points in _ three _ dimensions .",
    "the latter collection is much more difficult to visualize since it is impossible for the human eye to determine the depth of a single point on these three - dimensional plots with sufficient precision .",
    "furthermore , the outer layers of points tend to obscure inner ones exists .",
    "thus we will examine the poincare plots of several independent three - dimensional trajectories , and then look at ways of visualizing the `` total '' poincare plot , with a broad range of initial conditions combined .",
    "poincare plots are plots of sections of phase space , affording a comparison of classes of trajectories over a broad range of initial conditions .",
    "we shall set @xmath129 throughout . in the equal mass case",
    "all of the bisectors of the 3-simplex represent equivalent crossings of particles .",
    "thus we can plot the crossing of any two particles ( equivalent to the @xmath15 particle crossing one of the bisectors in the three - dimensional potential ) all on the same graph .",
    "in the three - body case the poincare plot was that of the radial momentum of the simplex particle plotted against its angular momentum every time the particle crossed a simplex bisector @xcite .",
    "the most natural extension of the construction of these plots to three dimensions is to use spherical coordinates , and plot the radial momentum , denoted here as @xmath145 against the two angular momenta squared : @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "more concisely , we define @xmath148 to be the distance from the origin to our point of crossing in @xmath15 space , @xmath149 to be the _ azimuthal _ angle in the @xmath126 plane ( with @xmath150 ) , and @xmath151 to be the _ polar _ angle from the @xmath84 axis ( with @xmath152 ) .  from this , we denote the associated momenta of @xmath153 and @xmath151 as @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively .     specifically , from simple geometry relating our spherical coordinates @xmath156 to our cartesian coordinates @xmath15 , we have that @xmath157 and the unit vectors for these spherical coordinates are :    @xmath158,\\quad\\hat{\\phi}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c } -\\sin\\phi\\\\ \\cos\\phi\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right],\\quad\\hat{\\theta}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta\\\\ -\\sin\\theta \\end{array}\\right]\\label{sphereuv}\\ ] ]    the desired momenta are :    @xmath159    where @xmath160 is the momentum vector in @xmath15 space .",
    "then by substituting ( [ spheretrig ] ) and ( [ sphereuv ] ) into ( [ spheremom1 ] ) , we can find an expression for the momenta in terms of @xmath120 and @xmath118 : @xmath161    thus we can use ( [ spheremom2 ] ) to plot @xmath162 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 whenever two of the four particles cross one another .      as we will discover further on ,",
    "it becomes very difficult to visualize a complete poincare plot in three dimensions .",
    "we therefore will build up to this case by first examining individual poincare plots generated from single t    to keep things simple , we will first look at the case where our trajectory is in two dimensions .  this should result in a two dimensional poincare plot as well , as in the three - body case .  since @xmath118 is varied to keep the initial conditions consistent",
    ", we will arbitrarily choose @xmath85 and @xmath97 as the variables that we set to zero , thus making it into a two dimensional trajectory as seen in previous sections .",
    "our intuition is indeed correct , as can be seen in figure [ fig:2d_pretz_poinc ] .",
    "there a two - dimensional pretzel shape produces a two - dimensional poincare plot that coincides with those seen in the three - body case , consistent with the quasiperiodic motion of this trajectory .",
    "as expected , the value of the @xmath163  ( the momenta of the azimuthal angle ) remains zero throughout .",
    "this can also be seen from ( [ spheremom2 ] ) , with @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "more importantly , this confirms that the poincare plots of the four - body system will be generalizations of the three - body system , as was seen with the trajectories , validating our approach for generating these plots .",
    "now , we will look at the poincare plots for some of the `` nicer '' three - dimensional trajectories .  from figure [ fig : ann_pretz ]",
    "we generate a poincare plot that is given in figure [ fig : ann_pretz_poinc ] , shown from a few angles .    , shown here from all three directions , and from an isometric perspective .",
    "the broad circular bands are indicative of the quasiperiodic character of this trajectory . ]",
    "this plot is extremely interesting in that it does not seem to exhibit the same patterns as the three - body case .  remembering that this shape is actually a combination of annuli and pretzels",
    ", we can begin to see some patterns .  first , the elliptical shells ( they are actually extruded ellipses ) in this plot are very similar to the ellipses in the pretzel section of the three - body poincare plots , although no geometric pattern is immediately obvious .",
    "second , if we compare the scale on this plot to that of the previous and final poincare plots ( see next section ) , we discover that indeed it is only occurring in a smaller region of the larger plot - potentially the three - dimensional equivalent of the `` pretzel region '' seen in the three - body case ( albeit more complex , since this trajectory is not exclusively a pretzel ) .",
    "another example is shown in figure [ fig : odd_shape ] .",
    "we can see here that because of the skew of the shape in the trajectory plot , the poincare plot is not nearly as structured as the previous ones .  still",
    ", we can note some pattern , although it is much more difficult to see in three dimensions .",
    "each trajectory is quasiperiodic , but spread over a three dimensional space , with the pretzel trajectories forming a non - overlapping knotted structure . as with the 3-body case ,",
    "the poincare plots consist of circles with some width .",
    "these occupy a three dimensional volume , and the more loosely dispersed dots form a `` shell '' over the top of the poincare plot .",
    "examining other poincare plots of three - dimensional trajectories , we reach the limits of this particular approach .",
    "as we saw earlier , very few initial conditions actually produce nice three - dimensional paths , and the ones that do not produce similarly uninformative poincare plots .",
    "it is possible that if run for a significant number of time steps these plots would materialize into more than just a random collection of points in space , but the amount of computation required to produce the hundreds of thousands of time steps that would be required to check this is daunting , and probably not the best use of resources .",
    "moreover , it becomes increasingly difficult to visualize these plots as the number of time steps increases .     however , there is some support for the conjecture that more time steps will reveal better patterns .",
    "more time steps yield more particle crossings , and thus more points on the poincare plot .  instead of extending the length of the trajectory though",
    ", we can instead choose initial conditions such that two particles are extremely close together and cross frequently .",
    "we illustrate this with an example in figure [ fig : nice_poinc ] .",
    "_  _  the motion of the box - particle is characterized by a huge number of @xmath47 s with an occasional @xmath48  and @xmath53  ( as we would expect due to the large number of collisions between the two tightly bound particles ) . _ _  _ _ this trajectory produces a very nice three dimensional shape , demonstrating that three - dimensional poincare plots can be considerably more complicated than their two - dimensional counterparts .        to conclude this section",
    ", we plot a graph ( figure [ fig : poinc_comb ] ) that contains all of the previous poincare plots combined , just to give an idea of scale .",
    "now we move on to the problem of visualizing the complete poincare plot , with a variety of initial conditions included .",
    "the traditional approach generally involves choosing a range of initial conditions that fill in the important regions , and plotting all of the points on a combined two - dimensional plot .",
    "this approach has two immediate problems in three dimensions .",
    "first , the amount of space to fill in three - as opposed to two - dimensions makes the task of manually choosing initial conditions formidable .",
    "there is no reasonable way of ensuring that all of the possibilities have been covered , especially since there are a large number of variations and combinations of three - dimensional trajectories .",
    "we attempted to address this problem by automating the generation of data over a specific range of initial conditions .",
    "with five independent variables the number of possible plots is very large , necessitating a significant reduction in the number of time steps for each initial condition .",
    "we generated poincare data for each trajectory for five hundred time steps , giving about 1,000 poincare points per trajectory .",
    "the second problem is that of effectively visualizing all of these discrete points in three - dimensional space .",
    "we approached this problem by converting the data into volumetric density data , separating out the space into millions of tiny three - dimensional boxes , assigning a position corresponding to the location of the box and a value corresponding to the number of poincare points that fall inside .",
    "this yields a large three - dimensional grid of values , each representing the density of points in the poincare plot at that approximate location .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we can now easily take slices and contours , colouring them according to the volumetric value at the corresponding locations .",
    "this effectively decomposes the three dimensional data into a series of two dimensional plots .",
    "however there are disadvantages , the most significant being that we are more limited in our ability to zoom in to see self - similar patterns and structures at the resolution the number of chosen grid points .",
    "although we can always use more grid points , we quickly arrive at a situation in which there are too few points in a small region to satisfactorily `` fill up '' the density data .",
    "however we expect that some of the other important features , like the highly saturated regions of chaos , will show up well in our new plots",
    ".  since those regions have a large number of points , they should get a very high density value and thus stand out from the surrounding region .  with enough points and a small enough grid , it should also still be possible to see the general shape of the poincare plot in three dimensions .",
    "we will first examine two special slices :  that of @xmath166  ( the `` bottom '' slice ) and @xmath167  ( the `` side '' slice ) .",
    "for the bottom slice , we can use the condition @xmath166  to select the applicable points .",
    "this yields 400,000 points out of the 12 million that we generated .",
    "as we see in figure [ fig : poinc_tot_bottom ] , this two - dimensional slice compares quite well to the 3-body case @xcite .",
    "the figure suggests the presence of mixed regions of chaos and integrability , as further implied by figures 20 and 21 .        .",
    "notice the complex fractal - like patterns that show up as we zoom closer . ]    . ]    for the side slice , we could not use the condition of @xmath155 being _ exactly _ zero .",
    "@xmath166 will be true for any of the two - dimensional trajectories in planes passing through the @xmath84 axis .",
    "since @xmath118  is calculated from @xmath129 , most - if not all - of the two - dimensional trajectories in our parameter scan will be on planes passing through the @xmath84  axis ( initial conditions with @xmath89  are extremely unlikely ) .",
    "however , @xmath167  would only be true of a trajectory that remained in a cone rooted at the origin .",
    "hence we use the constraint of @xmath155  being `` close '' to zero , instead of exactly zero to get an equivalent slice .",
    "we used @xmath168  which produced about five - hundred thousand points .    ) . ]    the first thing that we notice is that the side slice does not display the same patterns and fractal - like properties as the bottom slice .",
    "this could be due either to too few time steps or to a failure to cover a sufficient range of initial conditions .",
    "it could also possibly mean that spherical coordinates are not the best choice for a generalization of poincare plots ; perhaps cylindrical coordinates or another transformation would have produced more revealing results .",
    "however it is also possible that the system simply does not demonstrate any clearly definably pattern when sliced along the @xmath167  plane .",
    "we can get an idea of the true three - dimensional shape of this poincare graph by slicing the volume into multiple @xmath169  planes , each coloured according to density with brighter colours being higher densities .",
    "unfortunately this approach allows us to see little more than the general `` shape '' of the plot .  as the diagrammatic slices are not enlightening",
    "we shall not present them here .",

    "the lyapunov exponents , a trend of values emerge .",
    "first , trajectories that were considered to be mostly chaotic in nature ( based on the lissajous figures accompanying them ) have lyapunov exponents on the order of @xmath178 for trajectories that are periodic , the lyapunov exponents are on the order of @xmath179 for these small lyapunov exponents , the exact numerical values for the exponents are more uncertain because the small fluctuations in these graphs are on the order of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the mean value of the graphs over the last hundred collisions are used to obtain a numerical estimate .",
    "there also seems to be a range of intermediate values for lyapunov exponents for quasiperiodic trajectories in the range of @xmath180to @xmath181    one noteworthy feature of some lyapunov graphs is orbital bifurcation , in which the apparent stabilization of the largest lyapunov exponent is punctuated by a sudden increase toward a new value .",
    "we found this to occur in a small number of graphs we analyzed",
    "we have carried out the first investigation of the non - relativistic 4-body problem for a one - dimensional self - gravitating system in the equal mass case .",
    "this system is the largest value of @xmath0  in which the motion can be directly visualized in terms of the motion of a single particle , referred to as the box particle , which is inside a linear potential whose equipotential surfaces are a simplex that has the shape of six square pyramids with their bottoms joined in the shape of a cube .",
    "we showed how to classify the motions of this system in terms of braid group operators , and were able to generalize this classification to arbitrary values of @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the trajectories of the box - particle form natural generalizations of the 3-body case , thickening in one direction for small departures from planar motion , in which the box - particle s position _ and _ momentum coordinates are initially zero .",
    "a common ( and somewhat unexpected ) feature is that quasi - periodic motion can appear in certain two - dimensional projections of the box - particle s trajectory whilst other projections yield an apparently chaotic motion .",
    "we generalized the poincare plots of these trajectories to be three - dimensional , where the radial momentum of the box - particle is plotted against the two components of its angular momenta in spherical coordinates whenever the box particle crosses a bisector of the equipotential simplex .",
    "while plots for specific trajectories can be straightforwardly constructed , a 3-dimensional poincare plot over a large variety of initial conditions proves extremely difficult to visualize in any practical sense .",
