    "one fundamental aim of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to explore the phase transition from the hadronic matter ( hm ) to the quark - gluon matter ( qgm ) .",
    "evidences for the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) were reported years ago @xcite . the rhic beam energy scan ( bes )",
    "was then proposed @xcite .",
    "attempts are being made to experimentally locate the qcd critical point ( cp ) , where the first order phase transition gives over to the  crossover \" @xcite in the qcd phase diagram of temperature @xmath1 vs. baryon chemical potential @xmath2 @xcite . because a cms energy ( @xmath0 ) in the heavy - ion collisions maps out a @xmath2 value ,",
    "a @xmath1 value can be extracted by fitting the particle ratio in the hadronic resonance gas ( hrg ) model @xcite to corresponding data in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the scanning over the phase diagram can then be performed . meanwhile , the search for cp signatures could also be done at each cms energy via the singularity ( nonmonotonicity ) shown in higher moment excitation functions ( higher moment as a function of reaction energy ) of the conserved observables . since the birth of rhic bes considerable progresses have been made in this field both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "a upsurge was reached last year at the 7@xmath3 international workshop on critical point and onset of deconfinement , nov .",
    "7 - 11 wuhan , china .",
    "although many relevant fundamental physics have been demonstrated , the mysteries remain .",
    "early in 2009 one employed the urqmd model investigating the net - proton , net - baryon , and net - charge kurtosis in the central pb+pb / au+au collisions from @xmath4=2@xmath5 gev to @xmath0=200 gev @xcite .",
    "they did not find any evidence of cp singularity in the kurtosis excitation functions .",
    "however , they did find that the kurtosis excitation functions behave quite different among the net - proton , net - baryon , and net - charge : the net - proton kurtosis becomes slightly negative at low @xmath0 and the net - baryon kurtosis decreases to a large negative value while the net - charge kurtosis keeps zero approximately .",
    "similarly , the kurtosis as a function of the rapidity window size were also different : both the net - proton kurtosis and net - charge kurtosis are differently fluctuated around zero , but the net - baryon kurtosis reaches a large negative value at the lager window . on the contrary , the opinion in @xcite is quite opposite . by assuming that the number distribution of a conserved observable is a binomial function and the strange baryon can be approximately considered , they analytically derived a relation between baryon number cumulant and the proton number cumulant .",
    "this means that the net - baryon cumulant has a similar behavior to the net - proton .",
    "recently it has been reported in @xcite that the effect of finite acceptance dramatically influences the cumulants of conserved observables , which makes the interpretation of experimental data measured in a given acceptance very uncertain . in @xcite",
    "the concept of  required acceptance \" is introduced , where all the particles , which are necessary for the physics in question , are covered .",
    "the required acceptance is not the full acceptance where all particles in the final hadronic state are covered .",
    "the authors assume that the bias of a real acceptance in a real experiment from the required acceptance can be represented by a binomial probability distribution , then they derive the general formula that relate the true cumulants which reflect the full dynamics of the system ( require acceptance ) with the actually measured cumulants ( real acceptance ) .",
    "this relation involves additional moments which can not be expressed by the cumulants and should be simultaneously measured in order to extract information about cp singularity . but how to measure these additional moments is not yet known .",
    "we attempt , in this paper , to further explore the relevant issues using the parton and hadron cascade model paciae @xcite .",
    "the net - proton , net - baryon , and the net - charge number event distributions and their higher moment excitation functions ( @xmath0=11.5 to 200 gev ) in the 0 - 5% most central au+au collision are calculated in different transverse momentum and pseudorapidity windows by the paciae model . as pointed out in @xcite that the study of higher moment excitation function singularity is a matter of dynamical fluctuation , but the statistical fluctuation is always dominant . in order to pronounce the effect of dynamical fluctuation , non - statistical higher moments ( cumulants ) of conserved observables",
    "are proposed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we calculate simultaneously both the real and the non - statistical higher moment excitation functions , and comparatively analyze the dependence of these excitation functions on the window size .",
    "suppose that the event distribution of the number of conserved observable @xmath6 is @xmath7 , then its n@xmath3 moment about zero is @xmath8 and its n@xmath3 moment about the mean ( @xmath9 ) is @xmath10 therefore its higher moments and moment products investigated widely are : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15    we employ the parton and hadron cascade model paciae to generate the real event distributions .",
    "the mixed events are generated by combining particles selected randomly from different real events , while reproducing the event multiplicity distribution of the real events @xcite .",
    "if the n@xmath3 real ( mixed ) moment about the mean calculated with real ( mixed ) events is denoted by @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , then the corresponding n@xmath3 non - statistical moment is @xmath18 like in @xcite .",
    "paciae is based on pythia @xcite which is devised for the high energy hadron - hadron ( hh ) collisions . in the pythia model ,",
    "a hh collision is first decomposed into the parton - parton collisions .",
    "the hard parton - parton interaction is dealt with lowest leading order perturbative qcd ( lo - pqcd ) and the soft parton - parton interaction is considered empirically . because the consideration of the initial- and final- state parton showers as well as the parton multiple interactions , the consequence of a hh collision is a partonic state composed of quarks ( anti - quarks ) , diquarks ( anti - diquarks ) and gluons .",
    "it is followed by the string construction and fragmentation .",
    "so a final hadronic state is obtained for a hh collision eventually .",
    "in the paciae model @xcite , a nucleus - nucleus collision is first decomposed into nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions according to the collision geometry and nn total cross section .",
    "each nn collision is dealt by pythia with string fragmentation switched - off and the diquarks ( anti - diquarks ) broken into quark pairs ( anti - quark pairs ) . when all nn collision pairs are exhausted , a partonic initial state ( composed of quarks , antiquarks , and gluons ) is obtained for a nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "this partonic initial stage is followed by a parton evolution stage , where parton rescattering is performed by the monte carlo method with @xmath19 lo - pqcd cross sections @xcite .",
    "the hadronization stage follows the parton rescattering stage .",
    "the lund string fragmentation model and a phenomenological coalescence model are provided for the hadronization .",
    "then the rescattering among the produced hadrons is dealt with the usual two body collision model @xcite . in this hadronic evolution stage ,",
    "only the rescatterings among @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and their antiparticles are considered for simplicity .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the details .",

    "we use paciae to generate the net - proton , net - baryon and the net - charge number event distributions in 0 - 5% most central au+au collisions at @xmath31=11.5 to 200 gev for the different acceptance sizes .",
    "the real and non - statistical higher moment excitation functions are then calculated , with all model parameters fixed .",
    "baryons are identified with @xmath32 and their anti - particles ( the non - strange baryons heavier than neutron and the strange baryons heavier than @xmath26 are assumed decay already ) and the charge with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath22 and @xmath35 .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    shown in the figure [ real_proton ] , from the top to the bottom , are respectively the net - proton , net - baryon , and the net - charge real higher moment excitation functions , with the mean @xmath36 , the variance @xmath37 , skewness @xmath38 , kurtosis @xmath39 , and the products @xmath40 and @xmath41 displayed in the panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) , respectively . in the figure ,",
    "the solid circles are the results in the acceptances of @xmath42 gev / c and @xmath43 , the open circles are the results in @xmath42 and @xmath30 , and the diamonds are the results in @xmath44 and @xmath30 .",

    "we see from these figures that :    * the shape of net - proton ( net - baryon , net - charge ) real higher moment excitation function changing with the window sizes is approximately similar only for the mean and @xmath37 , see top panel ( a ) and ( b ) ( middle panel ( a ) and ( b ) , as well as bottom panel ( a ) and ( b ) ) of fig .
