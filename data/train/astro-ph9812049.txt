    "infrared ( ir ) vibrational and rotational emission lines of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) have been observed in a wide range of interstellar environments , including molecular clouds in star - forming regions , herbig - haro objects , reflection nebulae , and planetary nebulae .",
    "h@xmath0 emission lines have also been observed in many starburst galaxies , and active galactic nuclei .",
    "two principal sources of such emissions are ( 1 ) photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) where the molecules are vibrationally excited by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) pumping or collisionally excited in gas heated by fuv radiation ; and ( 2 ) shocked regions , in which the hydrogen molecules are collisionally excited in hot gas behind the shock waves . observations of the rich h@xmath0 vibrational spectrum yield line ratios that are valuable probes of the physical conditions within the emitting source : the relative strengths of the @xmath5=10 and @xmath5=21 bands , for example , allow fluorescent excitation produced by fuv - pumping to be distinguished from collisional excitation ( black & dalgarno 1976 ; black & van dishoeck 1987 ; sternberg 1988 ; sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ; burton , hollenbach & tielens 1990 ; draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .    the relative strengths of emissions from ortho- and para - h@xmath0 molecules have been the subject of intensive observational investigation . in outflow regions where shock excitation is the primary emission mechanism ,",
    "observations of vibrational emission lines typically reveal ortho - to - para ratios for vibrationally - excited states that are comparable to 3 ( smith , davis & lioure 1997 ) , as expected if the gas behind such shocks has a ratio of ortho- to para - h@xmath0 in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) at high temperature ( @xmath6  k ) .",
    "abundance ratio @xmath7 in gas of temperature of 650  k. the observed ratio of ortho- to para - h@xmath0 in hh 54 is believed to be the remnant of an earlier phase in the thermal history of the gas when the temperature was @xmath8  k. as far as we are aware , hh 54 is the _ only _ astronomical source observed to date in which the total ratio of ortho- to para - h@xmath0 is demonstrably different from the expected lte value . ]",
    "pdrs , by contrast , often exhibit ortho - to - para ratios for vibrationally excited states that are smaller than 3 , with typical values in the range 1.5  2.2 ( hasegawa et al .",

    "in this paper we re - examine the interpretation of the ortho - to - para ratios for h@xmath0 in pdrs .",
    "previous discussions have failed to make a critical distinction between ( 1 ) the ortho - to - para ratio for vibrationally excited states populated by fuv - pumping ; and ( 2 ) the true ortho - to - para abundance ratio , which is generally dominated by molecules in the ground vibrational state . in ",
    "2 we present a brief review of h@xmath0 excitation in pdrs . we then argue that the ortho - to - para ratio for vibrationally excited h@xmath0 molecules in pdrs is generally not equal to the true ortho - to - para ratio , because the process of fuv - pumping occurs via _ optically thick _ absorption lines and the ortho pumping rates are therefore preferentially reduced by larger transition optical depths . in ",
    "3 we present several detailed model computations which illustrate the behavior of the ortho - to - para ratios in pdrs for a range of conditions . in ",
    "4 we analyze recent _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ observations of the pdr in the star - forming region s140 which provide strong support for our conclusions . in  5 we present a discussion and summary .",
    "pdrs are produced at the boundaries of molecular clouds which are exposed to fuv radiation fields ( @xmath9 ev ) .",
    "the incident radiation heats the gas , and drives the cloud chemistry via photodissociation of molecules and photoionization of trace species .",
    "recent reviews of observational and theoretical studies of pdrs have been presented by hollenbach & tielens ( 1997 , 1998 ) and sternberg ( 1998 ) .",
    "photodissociation and fuv - pumping of hydrogen molecules are critical processes in pdrs . at the cloud edges",
    "the h@xmath0 molecules are photodissociated rapidly , and the hydrogen gas is mainly atomic .",
    "the fuv radiation is attenuated with increasing cloud depth , and eventually photodissociation becomes slow compared to grain - surface h@xmath0 formation , and the hydrogen becomes molecular . in equilibrium clouds ,",
    "molecular destruction is balanced by formation at every location , and @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the local atomic and molecular hydrogen volume densities ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the total density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath15 is the grain - surface h@xmath0 formation rate coefficient ( cm@xmath4 s@xmath17 ) and @xmath18 is the local h@xmath0 photodissociation rate ( s@xmath17 ) . at each point in the cloud",
    "the populations of h@xmath0 molecules in specific vibrational and rotational levels ( identified by the quantum numbers @xmath5 and @xmath19 ) are determined by the competing processes of fuv - pumping , molecular formation , collisional excitation and de - excitation , and radiative decay .",
    "h@xmath0 photodissociation and fuv - pumping occur via the absorption of lyman and werner band photons in electronic transitions from the @xmath20 ground state to the excited @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 states .",
    "these excitations are followed by rapid spontaneous radiative transitions to the continuum and to bound @xmath24 levels of the ground electronic state .",
    "the transitions to the continuum lead to dissociation .",
    "the fuv - pumped molecules decay in a cascade of radiative quadrupole vibrational transitions which produces the characteristic spectrum of near - red and infrared fluorescent emission lines observed in pdrs ( black & dalgarno 1976 ; black & van dishoeck 1987 ; sternberg 1988 ; neufeld & spaans 1996 ; draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .",
    "the lyman and werner band absorption lines are expected to become optically thick in pdrs , and the molecules are then said to  self - shield \" .",
    "the typical absorption line becomes optically thick at an h@xmath0 column density of @xmath25 @xmath26 , which is much smaller than the hydrogen column of @xmath27 @xmath26 at which fuv dust - opacity becomes significant for normal interstellar gas - to - dust ratios .",
    "indeed , because the strongest fuv absorption lines become saturated at h@xmath0 columns @xmath28 @xmath26 , these lines lie on the square - root part of the curve - of - growth throughout most of the pdr and fuv pumping and photodissociation are initiated by absorptions in the  damping wings \" of the lines . at sufficiently large cloud depths",
    "the fuv - pumping and photodissociation rates become negligibly small due to the combined effects of dust - opacity and overlap of the broadest absorption lines ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ; sternberg 1988 ; draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .",
    "collisions play a critical role in the excitation of the lowest lying @xmath19-levels of the ground ( @xmath29 ) vibrational state .",
    "the most important are inelastic collisions with other h@xmath0 molecules , hydrogen atoms , and protons . in high - density clouds",
    "the @xmath24 level populations of vibrationally excited molecules are influenced by collisional processes @xmath30 and @xmath31 which induce vibrational energy transfers .",
    "the relative intensities of the resulting h@xmath0 emission lines differ in high density clouds because such collisional processes become more effective relative to radiative decay with increasing cloud density ( sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ; burton , hollenbach & tielens 1990 ; draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .",
    "molecular formation can also influence the populations in excited @xmath24 states .",
    "although in equilibrium pdrs only one molecular formation event occurs for every @xmath32 fuv - pumping excitations , formation can dominate the excitation of molecules in specific @xmath24 levels that are not directly populated by fuv - pumping .",
    "the ratio of ortho- to para - h@xmath0 is a critical parameter in pdrs .",
    "we recall that ortho - h@xmath0 possesses a total nuclear spin of 1 and exists only in states of odd rotational quantum number , while para - h@xmath0 has a zero total nuclear spin and is represented only by states of even @xmath19 .",
    "ortho- and para - h@xmath0 are not interconverted by any radiative process . in particular , the lyman and werner band transitions and the quadrupole ro - vibrational transitions which occur in pdrs can not induce ortho - para conversions .",
    "following the formation of h@xmath0 in each of the ortho and para modifications , conversions can occur in the gas via ",
    "spin exchange \" collisions . in cold ( t@xmath33 k ) gas the ortho - para conversion occurs slowly via collisions with protons ( dalgarno , black & weisheit 1973 ; flower & watt 1987 ) @xmath34 where in pdrs a small proton abundance is maintained by cosmic - ray or x - ray ionization ( sternberg & dalgarno 1995 ; maloney , hollenbach & tielens 1996 ) . in warmer and",

    "1997 ; lepp et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath35 control the ortho - para conversion .",
    "grain surface exchange reactions are a third possible mechanism for ortho - para conversion : we exclude such reactions from further consideration , because their efficiency is quite uncertain and because they are unlikely to affect significantly the ortho to para- ratio under conditions where vibrational emissions are excited ( burton , hollenbach & tielens 1992 ) .    when they are sufficiently rapid the ortho - para converting collisions with h or h@xmath36 drive the ortho - to - para abundance ratio to local thermodynamic equilibrium .",

    "the molecules are driven into the @xmath40 ( para ) ground state , and @xmath41 falls below 3 .",
    "the actual ortho - to - para h@xmath0 abundance ratio in pdrs depends on the competing effects of collisions , selective photodissociation of ortho and para molecules , and the molecular formation process .",
    "furthermore , as we will now argue , the ortho - to - para ratio of molecules in vibrationally excited states is generally _ not _ equal to the true ortho - to - para h@xmath0 abundance ratio .",
    "the behavior may be understood by considering a simplified analytic model in which fuv - pumping and photodissociation is assumed to occur via a single pair of ( non - overlapping ) ortho and para absorption lines .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio is controlled by the microscopic formation and destruction processes for the ortho- and para - h@xmath0 . in equilibrium",

    "if ortho - para converting collisions in the @xmath29 level are very rapid compared with either molecular formation or photodissociation then it follows from eqns .",

    "the detailed numerical calculations presented in  3 and  4 below suggest that the case of rapid ortho - para conversion amongst the @xmath29 states does indeed apply throughout most of the pdr under most conditions of astrophysical interest .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to consider the opposite limit in which ortho - para conversion is negligibly slow .",
    "if ortho - para converting collisions are slow ( @xmath58 ) then @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the formation temperature . in an lte population distribution characterized by a formation temperature @xmath60 , leading to an ortho - to - para ratio @xmath61 .",
    "] when the fuv absorption lines are optically thin , then @xmath62 and the total ortho - to - para ratio equals @xmath61 .",
    "however , as the absorption lines become optically thick , @xmath63 can become very large , or very small , depending on which set of ortho or para absorption lines first become optically thick . for absorption lines on the damping wings @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the total column densities of ortho and para molecules , and equation ( 5 ) can be written as the differential equation @xmath67 if @xmath61 is constant through the pdr it follows that @xmath68 thus , when ortho - para converting collisions are ineffective , preferential shielding of the ortho or para molecules maintains an ortho - to - para abundance ratio equal to the _ square _ of the value set by molecular formation .",
    "we now consider the ortho - to - para ratio for vibrationally excited states . in the spirit of the two - line approximation used to treat the fuv - pumping and photodissociation in our simplified analytic model , we lump all possible vibrationally - excited states into just two states , one representing vibrationally - excited ortho - h@xmath0 and one representing vibrationally - excited para - h@xmath0 .    if ortho - para conversion _ amongst vibrationally - excited states _ were rapid relative to other relevant processes ( as is usually the case for ortho - para conversion for @xmath29 molecules )",
    ", then the ortho - to - para ratio in vibrationally - excited states would also equal the lte value , @xmath69 .",
    "however , when fuv - pumping dominates the molecular excitation , ortho - para conversion amongst vibrationally - excited states is generally slow , leading to more interesting behavior .",
    "we assume that the vibrationally excited ortho- and para - h@xmath0 molecules are populated by fuv pumping , and are removed by quadrupole decay .",
    "this is the limit of `` radiative fluorescent h@xmath0 emission '' ( sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ) , which applies when ( 1 ) collisional excitation is negligible relative to fuv - pumping ; and ( 2 ) when collisional de - excitation and photodissociation are negligible removal mechanisms relative to spontaneous radiative decay . in equilibrium @xmath70 and @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the volume densities of vibrationally excited ortho- and para - h@xmath0 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the ortho and para fuv - pumping rates , and @xmath76 is the quadrupole radiative decay rate ( which does not depend on the ortho or para character of the molecule ) .",
    "the sum of these expressions is the formation - destruction equation for vibrationally excited molecules @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the total density of vibrationally excited molecules , and @xmath79 is the total ( net ) fuv - pumping rate .",

    "( 12 ) that @xmath89 assuming @xmath61 is constant through the pdr .",
    "equations ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) represent the key result of our paper .",
    "they show that when collisional processes are ineffective at thermalizing the ortho - to - para ratio in vibrationally _ excited _ states , then in the limit of radiative fluorescent h@xmath0 emission this ratio will roughly equal the _ square root _ of the true ortho - to - para abundance ratio .",
    "in particular , if the ( @xmath29 ) ortho - to - para abundance ratio is everywhere equal to an lte value of 3 , the vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratio will tend to a non - lte value of @xmath90 , because of the lower rates of fuv - pumping in the optically thicker ortho absorption lines .",
    "alternatively , if ortho - para interconversion of the @xmath29 molecules is inefficient then the vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratio is fixed by the molecular formation process .",
    "if the ortho - to - para ratio set by formation is equal to 3 , the ortho - to - para abundance ratio will then tend at large cloud depths to a non - lte ratio of 9 , due to selective self - shielding of the ortho h@xmath0 .",
    "equations ( 13 ) or ( 15 ) describe the relationship between the vibrationally excited and total ortho - to - para ratios for the case of radiative fluorescent h@xmath0 emission where fuv - pumping dominates the vibrational excitation and the excited molecules are removed by radiative decay .",
    "however , in dense ( @xmath91 @xmath13 ) clouds exposed to intense fuv - fields ( @xmath92 times the intensity of the mean interstellar field ) the pdrs can become hot ( @xmath93 k ) , and collisional excitation rather than fuv - pumping then dominates the vibrational excitation , particularly of @xmath94 molecules ( sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ; burton et al .",
    "1990 ) . under these conditions",
    "the vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratio will equal the true ortho - to - para ratio since the optical depth effects associated with fuv - pumping do not apply .",
    "ortho - para conversion is expected to be rapid in hot pdrs so the vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratio for the collisionally excited molecules will tend to the lte value of 3 .",
    "the observations indicate that most pdrs are generally either in the limit of radiative fluorescent h@xmath0 emission for which equations ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) apply , or are those which are hot enough to produce collisionally excited vibrational h@xmath0 emission . nevertheless two additional limits may be considered .",
    "first , in sufficiently dense gas , the cascade of vibrational de - excitations which follows fuv - pumping can become dominated by collisional rather than radiative de - excitations ( even when collisional excitation is slow ) . in this limit of  collisional fluorescent h@xmath0 emission \" de - excitations via h - h@xmath0 collisions can lead to ortho - para interconversion of the vibrationally excited molecules .",
    "second , if the fuv - field is sufficiently intense that photodissociation dominates the removal of the vibrationally _ excited _ molecules , the distinction between the vibrationally excited and @xmath29 ortho - to - para ratios disappears , and the vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratio is then also affected by the preferential self - shielding of vibrationally - excited ortho - h@xmath0 molecules . the ortho - to - para ratio in any vibrational state ( whether the ground state or an excited state ) is then simply given by equation ( 4 ) if ortho - para conversion is rapid , or equation ( 7 ) if ortho - para conversion is slow .",
    "we now present detailed model computations which illustrate the behavior of the ortho - to - para ratios in the limits described by equations ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) .",
    "we have carried out a series of computations using an updated version of the pdr models described by sternberg & dalgarno ( 1989 , 1995 ) .",
    "our models consist of static , plane - parallel , semi - infinite clouds which are exposed , on one side , to isotropic fuv radiation fields .",

    "the ratio of vibrationally excited ortho and para column densities , @xmath143 , converges to the slightly larger value of 2.2 , due to the small ( but non - negligible ) effects of collisional ortho - para interconversions of vibrationally excited molecules in the atomic hydrogen zone .",
    "the excitation diagram for this model is very similar to the excitation diagram for the  @xmath29 in lte \" model shown fig .",
    "2 . in both models ,",
    "the rotational populations for the vibrationally excited ortho and para molecules form distinct and vertically displaced distributions , consistent with the low and non - lte vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratios .",
    "the excitation diagram in fig .",
    "4 shows that the column densities in the lowest lying ( @xmath144 ) rotational levels of the @xmath29 molecules are very close to lte , but that when realistic collisional rate coefficients are assumed the higher lying rotational levels become progressively subthermally populated .",
    "this model illustrates explicitly that ortho - para conversion may typically be rapid enough to maintain an lte ortho - to - para abundance ratio of 3 for the @xmath29 molecules , but not for vibrationally excited molecules .",
    "the preferentially lower ortho pumping rates therefore drive the vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratio to the non - lte value of @xmath145 , consistent with equation ( 13 ) .",
    "vibrational emissions from h@xmath0 molecules , and ortho - to - para ratios for vibrationally excited molecules , have been observed in many pdrs .",
    "such sources include the reflection nebulae ngc 2023 and ngc 7023 ( gatley et al .",
    "1987 ; hasegawa et al . 1987 ; martini , sellgren & hora 1997 ) , the planetary nebulae hubble 12 , ngc 7027 and bd+30@xmath1463639 ( tanaka et al .",

    "et al . ) , the bipolar outflow dr21 ( fernandes , brand & burton 1997 ) , and the starburst galaxy ngc 253 ( harrison et al .",
    "1998 ) . typically , in regions where fuv - pumping dominates the molecular excitation the vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratios lie in the range 1.5 - 2.2 .",
    "contrary to what has been implicitly assumed in much of the previous literature on this subject , our results show that the actual abundance ratio of ortho and para molecules in pdrs is not accurately represented by the ortho - to - para ratio determined from observations of the vibrational emission lines .",
    "previous discussions have erroneously assumed that the ortho - to - para ratios inferred from such observations must be explained by actual ortho to para - h@xmath0 ratios smaller than 3 , and have invoked a variety of processes that might lead to such ratios , including the formation of @xmath147 with an initial ortho - to - para ratio less than 3 , rapid ortho - para conversion in low - temperature gas , or warm but time - dependent pdrs in which the ortho - to - para ratio has not had sufficient time to reach its high temperature lte value .",
    "our results indicate that such explanations are unnecessary : most observed values of the vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratio are entirely consistent with the assumption that the true ortho - to - para abundance ratio is in fact 3 .",
    "recent _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ observations of the pdr in the star - forming molecular cloud s140 corroborate our central result . with a broad spectral coverage that is not affected by atmospheric absorption , _ iso _",
    "has allowed both vibrational emissions _ and _ pure rotational mid - ir transitions of h@xmath0 to be measured from s140 ( timmermann et al .",
    "these observations show that the relative intensities of the vibrational emissions in s140 are consistent with excitation via fuv - pumping , but that the pure rotational emissions are collisionally excited in warm gas at a temperature @xmath129 k. most importantly , the ortho - to - para ratio for vibrationally excited molecules is observed to be significantly less than 3 , whereas the pure rotational emissions reveal that the true ortho - to - para h@xmath0 abundance ratio is equal to an lte value of 3 .    in fig .",
    "5 we present a model fit to the s140 data which illustrates this key observational fact . in our model",

    "( 1996 ) , these are the appropriate values for the gas density , incident fuv field intensity , and cloud inclination for the s140 pdr . for these parameters",
    "our model provides an excellent fit to the observed column densities of vibrationally excited molecules . in our model",
    "we also assume that the gas temperature varies as , where @xmath151 is the fuv dust continuum optical depth . ]",
    "@xmath152 for this thermal profile the gas temperature is equal to 500 k in the outer atomic layer , and falls rapidly to 50 k as the gas becomes molecular . in this model",
    "we adopt the same h - h@xmath0 and h@xmath36-h@xmath0 rate coefficients and proton abundance as in the third model presented in  3 .",
    "our s140 model provides a very good fit to the observed column densities of rotationally excited molecules in the @xmath29 state .",
    "this suggests that in s140 the warm gas traced by the rotational emissions is confined mainly to cloud layers where the hydrogen is atomic or partially dissociated .    in our model",
    "the ortho - to - para column density ratio for vibrationally excited molecules converges to a value of 2 .",
    "5 shows that this ratio is formed in outer cloud layers where the gas temperature @xmath153 k , and where the true ortho - to - para abundance ratio is close to the lte value of 3 .",
    "5 shows that at cloud depths @xmath154 the ortho - to - para abundance ratio falls below 3 as the gas becomes cold .",
    "however , at these large cloud depths the fuv - pumping rates become vanishingly small , and the total column densities of vibrationally excited molecules are unaffected . the excitation diagram in fig . 5",

    "1996 ) displays the observed values of @xmath155 in s140 together with our model fit .",
    "the excitation diagram again shows that the ortho - to - para ratio @xmath156 in vibrationally excited states is significantly less than the true lte value of 3 indicated by the pure rotational states .",
    "our s140 model is similar to the models displayed in figs .",
    "2 and 4 , and the behavior of the total and vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratios in s140 is consistent with equation ( 13 ) .",
    "the s140 observations provide strong support for our conclusion that the ortho - to - para ratios of @xmath125 typically inferred from observations of fuv - pumped h@xmath0 emissions imply that the true ortho - to - para abundance ratios in the emitting regions are equal to lte values of 3 .",
    "an lte ortho - to - para abundance ratio less than 3 would only be indicated by a vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratio significantly less than @xmath157    in shock - heated regions or in very hot pdrs , where collisional excitation is dominant , @xmath147 vibrational emissions are expected to reflect the true ortho - to - para ratio .",
    "in fact , observations of @xmath147 vibrational emissions in shocked regions associated with protostellar outflows and herbig haro objects do indeed reveal vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratios close to 3 ( smith et al .",
    "the effects of collisional excitation to @xmath94 within a very hot pdr are elegantly demonstrated by the recent observations of of the planetary nebula bd @xmath158 by shupe et al .",
    "spatially - resolved line ratios in this source indicate a decrease in the @xmath159 to @xmath160 line ratio and an increase in the ortho - to - para ratio for @xmath94 ( from a value @xmath125 to a value @xmath161 ) with decreasing distance from the central star . both effects may be interpreted as resulting from collisional excitation to @xmath94 in the warmest parts of the nebula lying closest to the star , and fuv - pumping of @xmath94 molecules in the outer cooler portions of the nebula .",
    "our analysis shows that the true ortho - to - para ratio is likely very close to 3 at _ all _ observed locations in this source .",
    "several theoretical discussions of the ortho - to - para ratio in pdrs have been presented in the literature .",
    "takayanagi , sakimoto & onda ( 1987 ) argued that the ortho - to - para ratio of @xmath125 inferred by hasegawa et al .",
    "( 1987 ) from observations of fluorescent h@xmath0 emission in ngc 2023 implies that either the gas temperature @xmath162 or formation temperature @xmath60 must be very low ( @xmath163 k ) .",
    "however , as pointed out already by black & van dishoeck ( 1987 ) , takayanagi et al .",
    "( 1987 ) assumed that the fuv absorption lines are optically thin , and neglected the critically important effects of molecular self - shielding .",
    "the computations of takayanagi et al .",
    "( 1987 ) are therefore not relevant to the interpretation of the ortho - to - para ratios in realistic pdrs .",
    "black & van dishoeck ( 1987 ) also noted that in their own models ( which do include optical depth effects in the fuv absorption lines ) low vibrational ortho - to - para ratios are obtained even when the formation temperature is large and @xmath105 , and suggested that their results may be due in part to different depth dependences of the ortho and para pumping rates .",
    "more recently , draine & bertoldi ( 1996 ) presented detailed models of @xmath147 excitation and emission in pdrs , and presented explicit computations of the ortho - to - para ratios for vibrationally excited ( @xmath94 ) molecules for a wide range of cloud densities , fuv field intensities , and gas temperatures .",
    "ortho - to - para ratios were obtained for the vibrational - excited states of h@xmath0 for two sequences of models ",
    "one with the ratio @xmath164 cm@xmath4 and another for @xmath165 cm@xmath4  and for each sequence results were presented for @xmath124 ranging from 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath166 @xmath13 , and maximum gas temperatures ranging from 200 to 800  k.    the numerical results of draine & bertoldi , as summarized in fig .",
    "17 of their paper , are fully consistent with our analysis , although the authors did not explicitly discuss the crucial distinction between the ortho - to - para ratio in vibrationally - excited states and the true ortho - to - para abundance ratio : that distinction that seems to have been misunderstood in much of the previous and subsequent literature .",
    "draine & bertoldi found that for @xmath167 @xmath13 and @xmath168 , the vibrationally excited ortho - to - para ratio is always equal to a non - lte value of @xmath169 , significantly less than 3 , while at higher densities and fuv fields the ratio approaches and even exceeds the lte value of 3 .",
    "our analysis shows that the behavior exhibited by the draine & bertoldi ( 1996 ) results at low @xmath124 and @xmath95 is almost certainly due to the preferential reduction of the pumping rates for ortho - h@xmath0 which as we have discussed is expected for radiative fluorescent h@xmath0 emission .",
    "molecules in their models , but our analysis suggests that these must be close to 3 . ] the behavior for high @xmath124 and @xmath95 , by contrast , is likely due to the combined effects of collisional excitation of @xmath94 molecules in hot gas , as well as of preferential self - shielding of vibrationally excited ortho molecules as discussed in  2 and suggested also by draine & bertoldi .    in conclusion , in our paper we have addressed a long standing confusion between the ortho - to - para ratio of h@xmath0 molecules in fuv - pumped vibrationally excited states , and the actual ortho - to - para h@xmath0 abundance ratio .",
    "we have argued that because the process of fuv - pumping in pdrs occurs via optically thick absorption lines , a typically observed ortho - to - para ratio of @xmath125 for fuv - pumped molecules is consistent with , and implies , an actual lte ortho - to - para abundance ratio of 3 , and is a signature of warm gas .",
