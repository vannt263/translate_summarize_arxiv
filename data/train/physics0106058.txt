    "the spear  3 design optics consists of two periodic arcs separated by the east and west matching cells  @xcite .",
    "intended locations for the insertion devices in the arcs are the twelve 3.1  m drift sections between the 14 arc cells and four 4.8  m drifts at the arc ends . at present ,",
    "the matching cells ( mc ) have identical symmetric optics with a 7.6  m drift at the center of mc and phase advance @xmath3 [ @xmath4 per cell .",
    "the east 7.6  m drift is available for the new ids , and the west mc will contain the rf accelerating cavities .",

    "the vertical beam size is 31 and 44  @xmath1 m at the i d locations in the arcs and mcs , respectively .",
    "the beam size and the i d gap can be reduced by decreasing the @xmath0 at i d , but this will increase the beam divergence and variation of @xmath0 in the i d . for a better i d performance , a large @xmath0 variation in the insertion device",
    "should be avoided by limiting the i d length or the minimum value of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 value is also limited by the acceptable size of dynamic aperture and beam lifetime .    in this report , we discuss the low @xmath0 options for the 7.6  m drift in the east mc .",
    "the west mc was maintained close to nominal in most of this study .",
    "the optics and dynamic aperture calculations were done using mad  @xcite and lego  @xcite codes , respectively .",
    "the present spear  3 optics has been well optimized for a maximum dynamic aperture .",
    "to maintain the current lattice properties , the following requirements were used for the low beta modifications :    * matched optics using local quadrupoles . *",

    "minimal increase of maximum @xmath5 functions .",
    "* realistic quadrupole strengths .",
    "in addition , we tried to keep equal or close phase advance in the east and west mcs and limit the sextupole strengths , since the stronger sextupoles and ring optical asymmetry may enhance resonance effects and reduce dynamic aperture .",

    "the dynamic aperture simulations included a full set of magnet errors and machine correction for six random error settings .",
    "several options for a matching cell with single low @xmath0 were analyzed as listed in table  1 , where @xmath10 is at the mc center , @xmath11 is the mc phase advance , @xmath12 the ring natural chromaticity , and @xmath13 the k - values of global sextupoles .    .single",
