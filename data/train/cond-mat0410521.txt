    "scalable quantum computation proposals , particularly in solid state architectures compatible with existing microelectronic technology , are of great potential importance .",
    "the exchange gate @xcite , based on the heisenberg interaction between localized spins is a key concept underlying several proposed quantum computer architectures in semiconductor nanostructures , where the spin of a localized electron serves as the single qubit.@xcite in most spin - based quantum computer proposals single - qubit operations involve rotations of individual spins by external magnetic field pulses ( essentially a modified electron spin resonance technique implemented on individual spins ) or by some other techniques ( _ e.g. _ local g - factor manipulation by external electric field pulses ) .",
    "the two qubit operation in solid state , spin architectures is projected to be achieved by the exchange gate operation .",
    "the ability of a tunable exchange gate ( which enables the exchange coupling to change from zero to a finite value within in a `` reasonable '' gating time ) in carrying out the `` swap '' operation leads to the implementation of the universal 2-qubit cnot gate which , along with single qubit gates , provide a universal set of quantum gates .",
    "the perceived advantages of solid state quantum computation are its scalability ( because of the existing semiconductor microelectronics infrastructure ) , the low decoherence rate for spin states ( as compared for example , with charge states in semiconductors ) , and the feasibility of precise control over the local inter - electron heisenberg coupling through the exchange gate . among the disadvantages",
    "is the inevitable presence of some spin decoherence due to the background solid state environment @xcite and difficulties in the measurement of single electron spin states .",
    "however , recent experimental advances @xcite have demonstrated single spin measurements of localized electrons embedded in semiconductors .    in this work",
    "we provide a detailed and quantitatively accurate theoretical study of two complementary aspects of solid state spin quantum computer architectures .",
    "first , we develop a theory for obtaining an accurate map of the low lying hilbert space of the quantum dot based spin quantum computer architecture ( the loss - divincenzo@xcite architecture in coupled gaas quantum dots ) in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "our calculation of the hilbert space structure of the coupled quantum dot ( with one electron on each dot ) system differs from earlier work on the problem in the sense that it is essentially exact for our model.@xcite earlier work obtaining the hilbert space structure of the coupled double dot quantum computer system used perturbative approximations akin to heitler - london or hund - mulliken theories.@xcite as explained later in this paper we manage to carry out an exact numerical diagonalization of the two - electron coupled - dot interaction hamiltonian by borrowing theoretical techniques which have been extremely successful in elucidating the ground and excited state properties of the strongly correlated fractional quantum hall system .",
    "second , we describe and discuss ( again using the exact diagonalization technique as the theoretical tool ) a subtle topological feature of a certain class of solid state spin ( `` cluster '' ) qubits , which have attracted considerable recent attention , where clusters of spins are cleverly aligned to serve as qubits ( rather than just single spins ) offering certain advantages in quantum computation . @xcite we show that in looped geometries these spin cluster qubits have higher - oder spin interaction terms ( 3-spin , 4-spin , etc .",
    "terms ) arising from chiral interaction terms which will have serious adverse consequences for quantum computation by providing nontrivial flux dependence which must be taken into account.@xcite our finding of the chiral hamiltonian in spin cluster qubits may have possible consequences for all spin quantum computing architectures ( and not just the semiconductor nanostructure based ones @xcite ) .",
    "again , the exact diagonalization technique is the theoretical method we employ to demonstrate , validate , and quantify the chiral spin hamiltonian .",
    "the common theme running through the two complementary topics studied in this work is a thorough investigation of the precise applicability of the heisenberg hamiltonian as a description of the spin interaction in exchange gate quantum computer architectures . in particular , we are interested in figuring out the limitations , and the constraints on the heisenberg interaction model as the underlying hamiltonian for exchange gate , two qubit entanglement in the presence of an external magnetic field . in this context",
    "we also want to know what , if any , ( and how large ) the correction terms are to the heisenberg model description of the exchange gate quantum dynamics in the solid state spin - based quantum computer .",
    "this study is motivated by the fact that precise knowledge of the exact hamiltonian controlling the qubit dynamics is absolutely essential in developing quantum computing algorithms ( and architectures ) since in quantum computation the hamiltonian itself determines the programming codes .",
    "we must , therefore , know the hamiltonian precisely .    to study modifications to the heisenberg hamiltonian in tunnel coupled single - electron quantum dots in an external magnetic field we consider a realistic hamiltonian involving an equal number of parabolic quantum dots and electrons interacting through the coulomb interaction .",
    "we find deviations from simple heisenberg behavior where expected , when the quantum dots are strongly coupled and under intense magnetic fields .",
    "we find , using a variational ansatz@xcite and exact diagonalization , that at high magnetic fields the two - electron orbital states may be characterized by a vorticity .",
    "we define vorticity as the number of zeroes attached to each electron in the many - body wave function through the term : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a complex coordinate in the @xmath2 plane and the integer @xmath3 is the vorticity of the state . we find level repulsion between states with either even or odd vorticity .",
    "we identify the parameter regime required to maximize level repulsion among wanted and unwanted states ensuring adiabatic operation of the exchange gate .",
    "using perturbation theory applied to the extended hubbard model we find other qualitative modifications to the heisenberg interaction among weakly tunnel - coupled quantum dots .",
    "we find that in spin clusters formed from loops of three or more spins , many - spin terms couple to external sources of flux .",
    "we focus , numerically , on the triangular configuration in particular . here , we show quantitatively that a three spin chiral term couples to flux through the triangle.@xcite we investigate both the low and high magnetic field regimes and model the effective spin hamiltonian in terms of two parameters : the flux passing through the triangle _ and _ the vorticity ( or effective flux ) attached to each electron .",
    "we go on to study four spin configurations where three and four body terms modify the heisenberg interaction.@xcite we find that four body terms depend on the flux through closed loops as well .",
    "implementations of exchange based - only quantum computation with the least overhead , from a quantum computing perspective , involve several spins interacting simultaneously through the heisenberg interaction .",
    "although , this is not necessary .",
    "one may consider algorithms involving no more than two simultaneously coupled spins or geometries which exclude closed loops of spins . in",
    "what follows we analyze a special case : looped geometries of simultaneously interacting single - spin quantum dots which , as we will show , necessarily involve flux dependence .    in sec .",

    "ivb we compare exact diagonalization results of three , coupled , single - electron quantum dots with the spin hamiltonian derived using perturbation theory .",

    "we parameterize the magnetic field behavior of the lowest spin states with a spin hamiltonian which depends on the enclosed flux and the number of vortices ( or effective flux @xcite ) attached to each electron .",

    "for example , a direct experimental observation of the exchange oscillations is of interest in quantum dot physics .",
    "finally we mention that there are many other factors beyond the scope of our work ( _ i.e. _ beyond the model defined in eqs .",
    "( [ fullh ] ) and ( [ pot ] ) ) which affect the operation of the exchange gate .",
    "we cite three such example of recent interest which have been considered in the literature : inhomogeneous magnetic field effects @xcite , spin - orbit coupling @xcite , and multi - valley quantum interference @xcite .",
