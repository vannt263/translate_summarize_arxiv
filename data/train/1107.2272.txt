    "several topological indices based on graph theoretical notion of eccentricity have been recently proposed and/or used in qsar and qspr studies .",

    "the most extensive study has been conducted for eccentric connectivity index , for which extremal graphs and trees have been established ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the eccentric connectivity index of some special kinds of graphs was studied such as unicyclic graphs and different kinds of hexagonal systems ( @xcite,@xcite ) . for a detailed survey on these and other results concerning eccentric connectivity index",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . recently",
    ", mathematical properties of eccentric distance sum started to be investigated too .",
    "there are some results on eccentric distance sum of trees and unicyclic graphs ( @xcite ) and of general graphs ( @xcite ) . as for the augmented eccentric connectivity index ,",
    "there are some results with explicit formulas for several classes of graphs , in particular for some open and closed unbranched polymers and nanostructure ( @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise , augmented eccentricity index was not very much studied .    in this paper",
    "we present the results concerning extremal graphs and values of augmented eccentric connectivity index on class of simple connected graphs , on trees and on trees with perfect matching .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section preliminaries",
    "some basic notions and also the notation are introduced .",
    "also , explicit formulas for the value of augmented eccentric connectivity index for some specific graphs ( such as paths , stars , etc . ) which will later be proved as extremal are derived .",
    "third section is named extremal trees. in it we establish all minimal and extremal trees with respect to augmented eccentric connectivity index .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that maximal tree generally is not a star as is the case with other eccentricity based indices , but a specific kind of tree with diameter @xmath0 in fourth section we establish extremal trees among trees with perfect matching .",
    "finally , in fifth section we use the results for trees to establish the extremal graphs in class of general simple connected graphs .",
    "in this paper we consider only simple connected graphs .",

    "special class of graphs which will be of interest are trees .",
    "a _ tree _ is a graph with no cycles .",

    "we say that a vertex in tree @xmath27 is a leaf if its degree is @xmath28 otherwise we say that a vertex is non - leaf . also , we say that a vertex in a tree is _ branching _ if its degree is greater or equal than @xmath29 .",

    "we will also specially consider trees of diameter @xmath0 let us therefore introduce some interesting classes of graphs with diameter @xmath0 we say that a tree @xmath27 is _ degree balanced _ if its diameter is @xmath34 and all neighbors of ( the only ) central vertex differ in degree by at most one . with @xmath35",
    "we will denote degree balanced tree on @xmath6 vertices with degree of central vertex being @xmath36 note that there is only one such tree up to isomorphism .",
    "now , from definition follows that neighbors of central vertex in degree balanced tree @xmath27 can have only two degrees , say @xmath37 and @xmath38 note that @xmath39 is determined by @xmath40 and holds@xmath41 but , on the other hand @xmath40 is not determined by @xmath38 we have @xmath42    having this in view , we define ( almost ) perfect degree balance in a tree .",

    "note that by deleting edges degrees of vertices ( and therefore values @xmath90 ) do not increase .",
    "since we deleted at least one edge , that means that the degree of at least one vertex decreased and we have @xmath290 which concludes the proof .",
    "in this paper we studied augmented eccentric connectivity index on graphs and trees . we established that minimal trees with respect to augmented eci are paths @xmath32 ( corollary [ cor_path ] ) , while maximal trees are either stars @xmath33 for @xmath235 either degree balanced trees @xmath291 for @xmath292 ( theorem [ tm_maxtrees ] ) . using similar techniques we proved that in the class of trees with perfect matching minimal trees are again paths @xmath32 , while maximal trees are @xmath49 ( corollary [ cor_maxmatch ] ) . in the class of general simple connected graphs on @xmath6 vertices , maximal graphs with respect to augmented eci",
    "are complete graphs @xmath26 ( proposition [ prop_maxgraphs ] ) , while minimal graphs are paths @xmath32 ( proposition [ prop_mingraphs ] ) .",
    "the explicit formulas for the values of augmented eci of all these graphs which turned out to be extremal are derived and presented in proposition [ prop_values ] .",
    "there are many open questions for further study . in this paper",
    "we only initiated studying extremal trees with given parameter ( trees with perfect matching ) .",
    "one could try to establish extremal trees with given diameter , radius , number of pendant vertices , maximum degree ( chemical trees ) , etc .",
    "also , one could try to establish extremal unicyclic graphs with respect to augmented eci .",
    "deriving exact formulas for the value of augmented eci on some special kinds of graphs would also be interesting , just as studying of how augmented eci behaves with respect to graph operations .",
    "finally , there is also super augmented eci , which is similar to augmented eci , and is defined with @xmath293 it would be interesting to derive all those results for that index too . as for the results from this paper , we mostly relied on order of @xmath294 between pairs of vertices .",
    "since the same order holds for @xmath295 then the results for @xmath296 should be perfectly analogous .",
