    "entanglement has emerged as a key ingredient in the study of quantum many - body systems  * ? ? ? * . in particular ,",
    "the matrix product state ( mps ) or density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods for numerically studying quantum states work directly with the bipartite entanglement of a pure many - body quantum state across each `` cut '' . in a disordered system",
    ", this entanglement may vary widely between different locations of the cut .",
    "thus it is of interest to understand the probability distribution of the entanglement for such states .",
    "we are particularly interested here in highly - excited eigenstates that are of interest in studies of many - body localization ( mbl ) .    at quantum criticality , the ground - state entanglement of certain translationally - invariant systems is known to display universal behavior characteristic of the associated conformal field theory  * ? ? ?",
    "in one spatial dimension , the von neumann entropy ( in bits ) for a subsystem of length @xmath1 at such a conformally - invariant quantum critical point scales for large @xmath1 as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the central charge  * ? ? ? * and @xmath8 is the reduced density operator for the subsystem .    a similar scaling of entanglement as the logarithm of @xmath1 applies for a number of disordered one - dimensional systems whose ground states are governed by infinite - randomness fixed points of strong - randomness renormalization groups@xcite .",
    "this class of systems include the disordered heisenberg and xxz spin chains , and the transverse field ising model ( tfim)@xcite . for the disordered tfim , as long as it can be transformed to noninteracting fermions , this scaling of the entanglement also applies to all excited eigenstates@xcite .    with the surge of interest in the many body localization ( mbl ) phase transition , which might be described by an infinite randomness fixed point @xcite , a deeper understanding of this entanglement scaling becomes even more relevant .",
    "also , critical points within the mbl phase , should they exist , are governed in one - dimensional systems by infinite - randomness fixed points and exhibit this logarithmic scaling of the entanglement ( eq  [ eq : purescaling ] ) with an effective ( irrational ) central charge@xcite .",
    "the practical importance of quantum entanglement is highlighted by the success of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm , which relies on the low entanglement nature of certain quantum states to accurately represent them as matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite .",
    "there has been progress in obtaining highly excited eigenstates of mbl systems using this mps framework  @xcite . a variant of dmrg called dmrg - x has been developed to treat highly - excited states , with the specific goal of treating mbl systems  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of these algorithms depends on the bond dimension @xmath9 allowed on each of the internal bonds of the mps . representing a state to a certain accuracy",
    "requires the underlying mps to have a bond dimension @xmath9 on a bond which will generally scale exponentially with the entanglement entropy @xmath10 , where @xmath11 depends on the structure of the entanglement spectrum ( eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix ) .",
    "the logarithmic growth of @xmath0 with @xmath1 thus leads to a polynomial growth in the necessary @xmath9 and therefore of the computational complexity of the dmrg . in a disordered system , @xmath0 and",
    "thus the necessary bond dimension @xmath9 varies along the spin chain , so to evaluate the scaling of the dmrg algorithm s computation time we need to understand the distribution of the entanglement . in this paper",
    ", we derive an explicit expression for the probability distribution of the entanglement entropy at the infinite randomness fixed point of the critical random tfim for a finite open system , like those studied by dmrg . from the perspective of fisher s strong disorder renormalization group ( rg ) for the random critical tfim@xcite ,",
    "there is no difference between a ground or excited state@xcite , and so our results may also be applied to dmrg - x calculations .",
    "this expression is used to derive the scaling behavior and probability of finding entanglements from various points in the distribution .",
    "a finding is that the computational time is not dominated at large sample length @xmath1 by the local maximum of the entanglement .",
    "we check our findings with numerical simulations of the rg itself , as well as calculations on the disordered transverse - field ising model , and find excellent agreement .",
    "we first begin with a rough overview of fisher s rg analysis  @xcite for the random transverse - field ising chain hamiltonian of the form @xmath12 . at criticality , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are independent random couplings drawn from the same distribution ( which , for convenience , we assume has equal weights for positive and negative couplings ) . by performing a jordan - wigner transformation in the @xmath15 basis , this hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the conventional majorana fermions @xmath16 , with only nearest neighbor couplings : @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    the rg proceeds by always treating the strongest coupling , in exactly the same way as is done for a random singlet phase .",
    "the energy scale @xmath20 is defined to be the strongest of all the couplings @xmath21 , beginning at @xmath22 for the unrenormalized bare model .",
    "an rg `` step '' begins by finding the coupling with @xmath23 .",
    "since the distribution of the @xmath24 s is very broad , we will almost always have @xmath25 . as a result ,",
    "the two majoranas @xmath16 and @xmath26 form a two - level system with eigenenergies @xmath27 that is only weakly coupled to neighboring majoranas .",
    "we put this two - level system in one of its local eigenstates ( fisher always chose the ground state , since that is what he was focused on ) and then treat the coupling to its neighbors perturbatively .",
    "this results , from leading order in degenerate perturbation theory , in an effective coupling @xmath28 between the neighboring majoranas @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with the sign of the new coupling depending on whether the ground or excited state was chosen .",
    "after each such decimation , the energy scale @xmath20 is decreased accordingly .",
    "note that the entanglement structure and the magnitudes of the renormalized couplings are independent of whether the ground or excited state was chosen . at this quantum critical point",
    ", this rg flows to `` infinite randomness '' , meaning the probability distribution of @xmath31 becomes arbitrarily broad , and the approximation of keeping only the leading - order perturbative coupling becomes asymptotically exact@xcite .",
    "it is convenient to use the scaled log couplings @xmath32 and log energy cutoff @xmath33 , which is the rg flow parameter . after a decimation ,",
    "the new @xmath34 is then simply given by @xmath35 , greatly simplifying the flow equations .",
    "solving the flow equations results in the fixed point distribution@xcite",
    "@xmath36    in the original spin language , a field @xmath14 being `` integrated out '' corresponds to the local state of the renormalized spin @xmath37 being fixed to @xmath38 or @xmath39 , which more microscopically represents an equal - amplitude linear combination of some particular pattern of the bare @xmath40 s within the cluster and its opposite under flipping all spins .",
    "this step thus introduces one bit of entanglement across any cut within this cluster . a bond @xmath13 being",
    "`` integrated out '' corresponds to the two renormalized spins @xmath41 and @xmath42 being fixed to be either parallel or antiparallel and thus combined to be one renormalized spin , so it introduces new microscopic correlations but no new entanglement . in this picture , an entanglement cut obtains one new bit of entanglement whenever a field @xmath14 is decimated across the cut , which is precisely half of all decimations .",
    "the decimations across the cut alternate between @xmath14 s and @xmath13 s : when the cut is between two renormalized spins it is on a bond @xmath13 .",
    "when this @xmath13 is decimated these two spins are fully correlated and the cut is then within the new renormalized spin and thus `` on '' a field @xmath14 .",
    "when that @xmath14 is decimated the entanglement increases by one bit and the cut returns to being on a bond between two renormalized spins .",
    "this process is shown in fig  [ fig : tfim ] .",
    "thus when the number of decimations across a cut is @xmath43 , the entanglement across that cut is @xmath44 bits .",
    "to obtain the probability distribution for the the number of decimations @xmath43 across a single cut for a system of fixed total length @xmath1 , we first instead consider the problem of having a system at a fixed log energy cutoff @xmath45 .",
    "this is significantly simplified due to the fact that the `` steps '' in @xmath46 between two decimations are , at the fixed point , independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) events  @xcite .",
    "suppose on running this rg the most `` recent '' decimation across our cut was at log energy cutoff @xmath47 .",
    "once the cutoff has increased to a higher @xmath45 , what is the probability @xmath48 that no more decimations across our cut have happened ? at the critical fixed point , this probability depends _ only _ on @xmath49 , so @xmath50 . solving the flow equations  @xcite",
    ", one finds @xmath51 and therefore , the probability @xmath52 that the next decimation occurs at @xmath53 is given by @xmath54    now we may proceed towards the distribution of total decimations @xmath43 between @xmath47 and a final cutoff @xmath45 .",
    "we begin with a decimation that occurred initially at @xmath47 , followed by @xmath43 decimations happening at @xmath55 , with all @xmath56 . taking advantage of the i.i.d .",
    "nature of the steps in @xmath46 , we define @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , so that the probability of having @xmath43 decimations is obtained by integrating over all possible @xmath59 with their respective probabilities , @xmath60 r(\\ell-\\ell_n)~.      \\label{}\\ ] ]    this integral can be expressed as a convolution in the variables @xmath61 , which we can then apply the method of laplace transforms to , resulting in @xmath62}^n \\tilde{r}(a )      \\label{}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 denotes the laplace transformation , and @xmath11 is the laplace conjugate variable .",
    "@xmath64 can be calculated explicity from eq .",
    "[ eqn : r(l ) ] to be @xmath65 .",
    "to invert the laplace transform , we employ the bromwitch integral @xmath66\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is chosen such that the contour of integration is to the right of all singularities of the integrand in the complex plane . in the limit of large @xmath53 ,",
    "with @xmath69 kept finite , this integral can be well approximated by the saddle point method . by analyticity of @xmath70 , the saddle point for @xmath71",
    "is on the real @xmath11 axis at the minimum of @xmath72 to the right of both of its singularities .",

    "the connection to a system of fixed size can now be done by relating@xcite @xmath81 , up to some proportionality constant ( which we set to @xmath82 for now as it does not affect any of our immediate conclusions ) .",
    "this works because in the large @xmath53 limit , the fluctuations of log lengths are of order one : @xmath83 .",
    "thus , after the substitution @xmath84 , for the critical random tfim the distribution of the bipartite entanglement @xmath44 ( in bits ) across a cut takes on the form @xmath85 for a finite sample of length @xmath1 with open ends , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "there are a few interesting regions in this function that deserve mentioning .",
    "the fraction of cuts with zero entanglement is non - zero but vanishingly small , scaling as @xmath88 , with @xmath89 .",
    "meanwhile , the typical ( most likely ) entanglement is at @xmath90 .",
    "this is in agreement with the mean entanglement entropy for the tfim of @xmath91 for a single cut  @xcite . also of interest is the typical largest entanglement cut to appear in a sample .",
    "this is the @xmath0 which appears with probability scaling @xmath92 , of which there are @xmath93 of in each sample .",
    "this happens when @xmath94 , which is at @xmath95 , much larger than the typical @xmath96 .",
    "the cumulant generating function for this distribution @xmath97 has been obtained analytically previously  @xcite . to see the relation between these two results ,",
    "one can express in the limit of large @xmath53 ( using the same saddle point approximation ) , @xmath98 in agreement with ref .   at large @xmath53 up to additive logarithmic corrections .",
    "thus , the connection between @xmath99 and @xmath100 is via a legendre transform .",
    "what does this distribution of entanglement mean for numerical techniques such as dmrg that rely on entanglement ? to accurately represent a state as a matrix product state ( mps ) , the number of states kept ( or bond dimension ) @xmath9 is related to the entanglement across a cut on that bond .",
    "having a high bond dimension allows dmrg to capture states more accurately , but at the cost of increased computation time . at the infinite randomness fixed point , the entanglement comes only in the form of @xmath0 maximally entangled pairs , so the entanglement spectrum is therefore simply @xmath101 equal nonzero eigenvalues , followed by zeros , for which a bond dimension of @xmath102 is needed . using an algorithm that allots bond dimension independently for each bond as needed to attain a certain accuracy",
    ", we can ask the question of how the distribution of entanglement affects the scaling of the computation time for such a numerical technique .    the dmrg - x algorithm for finding highly excited",
    "mbl eigenstates  @xcite relies on the diagonalization of a @xmath103 effective hamiltonian , where @xmath104 is the local physical number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this diagonalization can be done in full , or using alternatives such as shift - invert lanczos .",
    "the computational complexity of these algorithms scale as some power @xmath7 of the bond dimension . for full exact diagonalization , @xmath105 , while @xmath7 would be smaller for methods that scale more favorably at large bond dimension .",
    "letting @xmath106 denote the computation time , we have @xmath107 , where we have defined @xmath108 .",
    "we can now ask what the scaling of the mean computational time @xmath109 is with system size @xmath1 .",
    "the average computation time per bond scales as @xmath110 up to logarithmic corrections , for large @xmath1 @xmath111}~.      \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for full exact diagonalization , @xmath105 and one finds the time to be dominated by bonds with @xmath112 , resulting in @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "the mean time for treating every bond in the full sample thus scales as @xmath115 .",
    "these powers will only be smaller if a method that scales more favorably than full exact diagonalization can be used .",
    "this ignores the strong correlation of entanglement entropy between bonds within a sample , which are important but do nt affect these exponents for the _ mean _ time .",
    "the maximum entanglement bonds were found earlier to occur near @xmath116 , which are higher in entanglement and rarer than the ones that dominate the computation time .",
    "this is important , as it means that most samples will have a few bonds of this high difficulty , but most of the computational time will still be spent on somewhat easier bonds that appear with higher frequency . indeed",
    ", this indicates that the computational time for a sample will generally not be determined by its most difficult bond , for which there may be large sample - to - sample variation ; this suggests that the computation time should `` self - average '' .",
    "to check our analytic findings , we numerically run the infinite randomness rg on many samples . the system is treated as an array of blocks which are the bonds between the majorana modes in the renormalized model .",
    "each block @xmath117 has a coupling strength @xmath118 , a length @xmath119 and a normalized distribution @xmath120 for the number of decimations @xmath43 across all internal cuts within the block .",
    "the blocks are initialized with a coupling @xmath118 from the fixed point distribution ( eq  [ eq : pbeta ] ) with @xmath121 , an initial length @xmath122 , and a trivial initial internal distribution of @xmath43 of @xmath123 . upon decimation of a block @xmath117",
    ", the blocks @xmath124,@xmath117 , and @xmath125 are merged to a single block , and the probability distribution is updated as @xmath126 the coupling strength is updated as prescribed by the rg rules , and the new length is simply the summation .    to obtain the number of decimations given a fixed flow interval @xmath58 , we simply run the rg until the log energy cutoff has reached the desired value .",
    "then , the probability distribution can be sampled from all the remaining blocks in the system weighted by their length .",
    "the probability distribution for a system of fixed size @xmath1 , on the other hand , can be obtained by initializing the system with an odd number of blocks @xmath1 ( each of initial length @xmath127 ) and simply running the rg until only one block remains , which is guaranteed to have length @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : randomsinglet ] shows the numerical results for fixed @xmath45 , and fixed @xmath1 , along with the ( normalized ) analytical predictions from eq  [ eq : p_n_ell ] . in the case of fixed @xmath1 , the substitution @xmath128 is used , taking advantage of the relationship between the mean @xmath1 and @xmath45 . in both cases ,",

    "finally , we compare with results for the random transverse field ising model , which can be obtained by a mapping to noninteracting majorana fermions and the entanglement entropy obtained from the single particle correlation matrix  @xcite . due to self duality ,",
    "this system is critical when the distribution of @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the same .",
    "we pick the disorder distribution to be the fixed point distribution eq  [ eq : pbeta ] .",
    "since we can always rescale the energy , we set @xmath132 so the cumulative distribution for @xmath130 is given by @xmath133 for @xmath134 , and similarly for the on - site fields @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath45 is the parameter that flows towards infinite randomness , so we expect the fisher rg to hold for large @xmath45 . at small @xmath45 ,",
    "the distribution becomes more and more narrow arround @xmath135 , and so realistically our results can not apply for very small @xmath45 . on the other hand , very high @xmath45 runs into problems with machine precision at large system sizes .",
    "we will focus on @xmath136 , which corresponds to a flat disorder distribution as is commonly used in studies of localization ( cf . the anderson model ) .    in comparing with actual microscopic models",

    "notice that the fitted @xmath5 is typically much smaller than 1 , this is a result of the fact that for @xmath142 the localization length , entanglement will grow much quicker than @xmath143 , and so at large @xmath1 , @xmath144 will appear to have a small @xmath5 .",
