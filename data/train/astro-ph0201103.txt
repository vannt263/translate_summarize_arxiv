    "ram - pressure by intracluster medium ( icm ) causes the stripping of interstellar matter ( ism ) from galaxies ( farouki , shapiro 1980 ; kritsuk 1984 ; gaetz et al .",
    "1987 ; balsara et al . 1994 ; sofue 1994 ; quilis et al .",
    "it also produces a disturbed distribution of ism in galaxies , such as head - tail h i structures as observed in virgo galaxies ( cayatte et al .",
    "1990 ; vollmer et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; phookun et al . 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "the ram - pressure effect has , thus , been discussed mainly in relation to  gas stripping and outer disk structures .",
    "however , little attention has been paid to its effect on the inner molecular disk and arms .",
    "only a few authors have discussed the ram effect on the spiral structure ( tosa 1994 ) and molecular clouds ( kenney et al .",
    "1990 ; sofue 1994 ) .",
    "kenney et al . (",
    "1990 ) have shown that virgo galaxies often exhibit asymmetric inner molecular disks .",
    "a recent high - resolution co - line survey of virgo cluster galaxies such as ngc 4254 and ngc 4654 ( sofue et al . in preparation ) has revealed that some of them show a significant asymmetry of the inner molecular disks and arms .",
    "it is not clear if such an inner deformation of dense gas disks can be produced by ram pressure effect , which is thought to be the cause of their deformed  envelops . since these two galaxies have no massive companion that can disturb such inner disks , and they both show a head - tail  outer structure ( phookun et al .",
    "1993 , 1995 ) , the inner deformation of molecular disks could also be due to the ram - pressure effect , while such an inner ram effect has not yetbeen investigated .    if the wind is very strong , such as assumed by quilis et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the core of a rich cluster with an icm density of @xmath0 atoms @xmath1 and a wind velocity higher than @xmath2 , the ism of any galaxies would be completely stripped .",
    "on the other hand , if the wind is mild , in such a case as for the virgo cluster , where the icm density is of the order of @xmath3 and the velocity is @xmath4 , outer  envelopes are deformed to produce head - tail structures ( vollmer et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) . in current simulations , such as those by vollmer et al . , which were aimed at gas stripping and tailing of the outer  disks , the detailed behavior of the inner disk gas inside @xmath5 kpc was not well understood because of the resolution .",
    "in the present paper , we consider a mild icm wind , and discuss its effect on the inner disk gas based on 2d hydrodynamical simulations with higher resolution than those aimed at outer  stripping , as above .",
    "if we simply apply the ram - stripping condition to an azimuthally structure - less gas disk , the ram pressure would hardly affect the inner disk .",
    "however , if we consider a spiral structure with an arm - to - interarm density contrast , it may happen that the ram - pressure can affect the low - density interarm gas .",
    "we consider here the possibility that the ram - pressure can affect the dense molecular gas within the central few kpc region of spiral galaxies through disturbances of the orbits of inter - arm gas , even if the icm wind is not strong enough to strip the disk gas .",
    "the component of the ram force parallel to the galactic plane exerted by an intergalactic wind on a gas element is given by ~  s   ^2  , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the gas densities of icm and ism , respectively , @xmath8 is the surface area of the element , and @xmath9 is the angle between the wind direction and the galactic plane ( farouki , shapiro 1980 ; kritsuk 1984 ; sofue 1994 ; tosa 1994 ) .",
    "the motion of the undisturbed ism element is governed by the gravitational force , which is approximately equal to the centrifugal force , ~  d  s   ^2/r , where @xmath10 is the thickness of the gas disk , and @xmath11 is the galactocentric radius of the element .",
    "now , the ratio of @xmath12 to @xmath13 is given by ~ r d ( ) ^2   , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number densities of hydrogen atoms of the icm and ism , respectively . if @xmath16 exceeds unity , the ram force can disturb the ism motion , while if it is smaller than unity , the ism motion is little affected .",
    "let us consider the inner part of a galaxy at @xmath17 kpc with @xmath18 pc , rotating at @xmath19 .",
    "for an icm wind with @xmath20 @xmath1 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , we obtain the ratio to be ~0.6  ^-1  [ h  cm^-3 ] .",
    "this relation implies that the ism is stripped if @xmath23 h @xmath1 , since the force perpendicular to the galactic plane is of the same order .",
    "we stress , however , that the relation indicates that the orbits of the gas within the disk plane is significantly disturbed if @xmath24 h @xmath1 , even if the wind is not strong enough to strip the gas .",
    "this may indeed apply to the inter - arm ism in the inner disk within a few kpc radius . on the other hand , high - density galactic shocked arms , where @xmath25 h @xmath1",
    ", would be hardly disturbed .",
    "we , thus , anticipate that , even if the icm wind is mild , not strong enough to strip the disk , the interarm gas in the inner disk would be significantly disturbed , which may result in deformed galactic shock waves . since @xmath26 is greater on the head - wind side of the rotation axis compared to the following - wind side , the deformed shock waves could be asymmetric with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the ram - deformation mechanism of the dense molecular arms , and how a lopsided spiral pattern is created . since the density of the inter - arm gas ( a and a@xmath27 in fig .",
    "2 ) is much lower than the average density of the disk , the ram force by the icm wind ( thin lines ) easily disturbs the orbits of inter - arm gas ( thick curved arrows ) .",
    "the gas on the distorted orbits encounters density waves ( dashed spirals ) at different places ( b and b@xmath27 ) from those expected for undisturbed orbits ( dashed lines ) , and produces deformed dense molecular arms ( thick spirals ) . in the next sections we discuss a numerical simulation of the ram deformation of spiral arms in order to understand whether this mechanism can indeed create deformed shocked arms , and",
    "how the deformed arms look like in realistic model disks .    ",
    "the ram - pressure acceleration per unit mass is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the icm density , @xmath30 is the icm velocity with respect to the galaxy , @xmath31 is the circular velocity of the clouds , and @xmath32 is evaluated to be on the order of @xmath33 ( e.g. , tosa 1994 ) .",
    "we assume that the galactic disk is thin and faces the icm wind everywhere , being not shielded by neighboring clouds .",
    "because this assumption would not apply to an edge - on wind , we consider here a wind with a mild inclination .",
    "we consider the inner disk of a galaxy , where the gravitational potential is deep and the ism is dense enough so that stripping does not occur , as discussed in the previous section , and we treat a 2d disk in a fixed rotating potential .    for the velocity of a galaxy in the icm @xmath30 and the icm density @xmath29 , we adopt three values for each parameter . the galaxy s velocity , @xmath30 , is taken to be 530 , 1000 , and 1500 , where the first value is suggested by phookun , mundy ( 1995 ) for ngc 4654 in the virgo cluster . the icm density , @xmath29 is taken to be @xmath34 @xmath1 , @xmath35 @xmath1 , and @xmath36 @xmath1 , where the first value is typical for the intergalactic density .      for simplicity",
    ", we assumed that the interstellar gas is ideal , inviscid , and compressible .",
    "we used a freely downloadable and usable hydrodynamical code , vh-1 ( blondin , lufkin 1993 ) .",
    "this is a multidimensional hydrodynamics code for an ideal compressible fluid written in fortran , developed by the numerical astrophysics group at the university of virginia based on the piecewise parabolic method lagrangian remap ( ppmlr ) scheme of colella , woodward ( 1984 ) .",
    "the ppmlr has the advantage of maintaining contact discontinuities without the aid of a contact steepener , and is sufficiently good to be applied to a galactic - scale hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "the code does not take into account the gas s self - gravity , artificial viscosity , variable gamma equation of state , and radiative heating and/or cooling .",
    "the self - gravity of the gas is not taken into account , because we consider a case where the gas mass is not so much as to contribute to the density wave potential by the stellar disk , and also because we do not intend to discuss such processes as clumping of gas and cloud formation in the arm and inter - arm regions .",
    "the interstellar gas can be assumed to be isothermal , as is assumed here , while if cooling is taken into account , the shocked gas arms would become much denser than those calculated below",
    ". however , all such neglection would not affect the physical essence of the present study , which was aimed at simulating ram - deformation of the orbits of inter - arm gas and resulting disturbed shocked arms , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "we implicitly give a gravitational potential , which comprises the following two terms : ( i ) a static axisymmetric potential , and ( ii ) a nonaxisymmetric , rotating bar potential .",
    "the potential is expressed by @xmath37 we adopt a `` toomre disk '' ( toomre 1981 ) potential for the axisymmetric component as given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the core radius and @xmath40 . through our numerical simulation , we fixd the core radius and maximum circular velocity to be @xmath41 kpc and @xmath42 .    the nonaxisymmetric potential was taken from sanders ( 1977 ) , assuming rigid rotation at a pattern speed , @xmath43 , which has the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the strength of the bar of the order of @xmath46 .",
    "spiral shocked arms of gas are produced by this potential .",
    "initially , we set @xmath47 two - dimensional cells corresponding to 12.8 kpc @xmath48 kpc field , while setting the field center at the coordinates origin .",
    "the initial number density was taken to be 5 @xmath49 the inner disk at @xmath50 kpc disk , and 1 @xmath49 at @xmath51 kpc .",
    "the initial rotation velocity of each gas cell was set so that the centrifugal force would balance the gravitation .",
    "the bar pattern speed , @xmath43 , was taken to be 23 , and the strength of the bar @xmath45 was taken to be 0.10 .",
    "figure 1 shows the result of a simulation including ram - pressure effects for the various parameter combinations , as described in the previous section . both the ism and spiral pattern rotate counterclockwise , and the icm wind blows from left to right .",
    "the simulation shows that the orbits of the diffuse inter - arm gas are easily disturbed by the ram force , which results in a significant displacement of galactic shock waves from their undisturbed symmetric positions , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "highly asymmetric dense spiral arms in the central region are produced by this mechanism if the wind speed is higher than @xmath4  and the icm density is greater than several @xmath52 h @xmath1 . a head - tail structure of dense gases slanted to the icm wind , like ngc 4654 nucleus ,",
    "can be produced by this mechanism , if @xmath53 is greater than @xmath54 @xmath49 s@xmath55",
    ". one spiral arm on the downstream side is prominent , reproducing the lopsided arms , as observed in ngc 4254 and ngc 4654 .",
    "2       we then calculated the distribution of molecular fraction ( elmegreen 1993 ) corresponding to figure 1 .",
    "the molecular fraction is defined by @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the mass and number densities of molecular and  gases , respectively .",
    "we used a method described by sofue et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and honma et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to calculate the galaxy - scale molecular fraction ; they investigated molecular fronts in spiral galaxies using a phase - transition model proposed by elmegreen ( 1993 ) . in this model , the molecular fraction",
    "is determined by three parameters ; the interstellar pressure , @xmath61 , the uv radiation field , @xmath62 , and the metallicity , @xmath63 . for @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    ", we adopted an exponential function of galactocentric radius , and calculated @xmath64 for corresponding gas pressure , @xmath61 , which is determined by the gas density in each cell .",
    "figure 3 shows the result of a numerical simulation of the molecular fraction .",
    "the inner few kpc region is dominated by molecular gas , where the molecular fraction is as large as @xmath65% .",
    "also , the molecular fraction increases suddenly at the galactic shocks , which are already deformed from symmetric arms .",
    "thus , the simulation has revealed that highly deformed inner molecular arms can be produced by ram - pressure disturbances on the inter - arm low - density regions .",
    "      we now compare the results with  and co - line observations of the virgo galaxies , ngc 4254 and ngc 4654 .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of ngc 4254 , 2407 , is about 1100  different from that of ngc 4486 ( m 87 ) , the center of the virgo cluster , 1282 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) . also , by comparing with the lopsided  distribution of ngc 4254 ( phookun et al .",
    "1993 ) and the ram pressure simulation on galaxies ( abadi et al .",
    "1999 ) , we can exclude the possibility of any face - on motion of ngc 4254 .",
    "assuming that ngc 4254 s orbit is inclined by @xmath66 from the line of sight , we may estimate the velocity of motion of ngc 4254 in the virgo cluster as being @xmath67 1500 .",
    "then , the rotation velocity of ngc 4254 ( @xmath67 150 ) is negligible compared to the wind velocity , so that the  tail grows toward downstream .",
    "the location of a prominent spiral arm ( iye et al .",
    "1982 ) and the direction of rotation are consistent with our numerical simulation .",
    "however , if we assume a slower wind velocity , e.g. , on the order of , or smaller than , @xmath67 750 , the simulation can not reproduce the observed features .",
    "our simulation for moderate icm velocity , which predicts an off - center bar of dense gas tilted toward the icm wind , is consistent with the observations of ngc 4654 in  ( phookun , mundy 1995 ) and co ( sofue et al . in preparation ) .",
    "our simulations show that spiral arm in the upstream side becomes stronger than that in the downstream side .",
    "considering the location of the prominent optical arm ( frei et al .",
    "1996 ) and an elongation of the observed molecular bar and  tail , we find that the direction of motion of ngc 4654 is toward the northwest , with a significantly high velocity compared to the velocity dispersion of the virgo cluster . taking it into account that the rotation velocity of ngc 4654 is relatively slow , the velocity of ngc 4654 in the virgo cluster would be greater than 1000 , although the heliocentric radial velocity , 1054 , is close to virgo s central velocity .",
    "we have considered the ram - pressure effects of a mild icm wind on gaseous disks in cluster galaxies .",
    "galaxies in the central region of the virgo galaxies show  deficiency , where the molecular gas fraction is higher than that of the galaxies in the outer region of the cluster ( kenney et al .",
    "this fact has been naturally explained by the ram - pressure stripping of the  gas : the ram effects are negligible on the inner molecular disks , while it is crucial for the  outer disk and envelops . on the other hand",
    ", it is also known that ram - affected virgo galaxies show asymmetric co gas distributions ( kenney et al .",
    "1990 ; sofue et al . in preparation ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we have shown that the orbits of the inter - arm ism are disturbed by the ram pressure of the icm wind , even if the wind is mild and not strong enough to strip the gas disk .",
    "the disturbed inter - arm ism causes highly asymmetric molecular arms in the inner few kpc of the disk . the 3d simulation by vollmer et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) for a similar wind condition shows that the inner disk within 10 kpc radius is not stripped , but suffers from perpendicular disturbances to the disk plane .",
    "vertical displacements may result in off - plane molecular structure in the inner few kpc disk , in addition to the asymmetric arms as simulated here using the 2d scheme .",
    "also , such 3d effects as the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz instability by the shearing motion between the disk and icm ( e.g. mori and burkert 2000 ) can not be touched upon by the present 2d simulation .",
    "therefore , detailed 3d simulations will be crucial to thoroughly understand the inner ram effect in more detail , while the present 2d results can tell us about some essential mechanism to cause the non - axisymmetric molecular structures in the inner disk .",
    "however , in the cases of much stronger winds , the 2d assumption can not be applied in any way , and 3d treatment of stripping is crucial .",
    "in fact , ram effect by a wind with a pressure much higher than that considered in this paper has been simulated by quilis et al .",
