    "the first task that we set for ourselves in this essay is to show that the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology with @xmath2 and @xmath3 requires significant amount of dark matter .",
    "this we accomplish without invoking the non - keplerian galactic rotational curves or gravitational lensing data  [  ] .",

    "this we do by showing that the dirac framework may suffice only for the description of the standard model fermions , and that dark matter  if we consider it fermionic , with spin one half  naturally asks for a dramatically new description where the dark matter field carries a klein - gordon , and not dirac , propagator . this thesis is a natural consequence of a recent preprint [ ] and two publications late last year  [ ] .",

    "since 1997 , data on supernovae 1a luminosities has built an impressive evidence for the existence of a form of energy that is accelerating the present expansion of the universe  [  ] .",
    "the latest data analysis  [ ] favors this dark energy to be of the form postulated by einstein in his now well - known cosmological term .",
    "the previous conflict between sn1a data and the wmap data on anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background noted by jassal , bagla , and padmanabhan  [ ] is now resolved  [ ] .",
    "furthermore , observations on primordial cosmic microwave background and large scale structure also favor a dark energy dominated universe which is spatially flat  [ ] .    in the context of inhomogeneous cosmologies",
    ", wiltshire has raised a serious objection  [ , also  ] to the just - stated standard interpretation of the sn 1a data and has provided an alternate interpretation which does not require dark energy  [ ] . working within the inflationary paradigm , he carefully distinguishes various clocks rates such as those associated with the astrophysically large gravitationally bound systems and the cosmic voids .",
    "conceptually , the raised questions can hardly be ignored . yet , the final verdict shall undoubtedly depend on whether such considerations turn out to be quantitatively important .",
    "preliminary calculations are already encouraging  [ ] .",
    "so , if here we proceed with dark energy as an option it is in the spirit of an open enquiry without prejudice as to the ultimate nature of the physical reality .    in the canonical wisdom ,",
    "the data thus favors a frw cosmology where @xmath4 with @xmath5 as constant .",
    "however , with an exception of a few papers , it is rarely appreciated that in this cosmology the _ non - linearity _ of the einstein field equations completely determines the proportionality constant that appears in the scale factor @xmath6^{1/2}\\ , t/ 2\\right)$ ]  [  ] .",
    "the proportionality constant depends on densities associated with matter and the einsteinian cosmological constant @xmath7 .",
    "the result of the analysis presented in  [ ] is that the ratio of the corresponding densities is not arbitrary but it carries a well - determined temporal dependence .",
    "this leads to significant strengthening of the standard paradigm of the @xmath8 cosmology , i.e the frw cosmology defined by the set  [ ] .",
    "@xmath9 in particular , the stated circumstance when exploited in the context of the stellar age bound determined by the ages of the globular clusters , and the fact that fractional density associated with the standard model content @xmath10 , requires existence of dark matter .",
    "these arguments are now refined and extended exploiting the recent work of  [ , also ] .    for the stated cosmology the einstein field equations , when their non - linearity is fully respected  [ ] , yield for the matter - dominated epoch    @xmath11    where @xmath12 here we introduced @xmath13 .",
    "the rest of the notation is standard , and is defined in ref .",

    "we shall first present a detailed calculation .",
    "this would be complimented by a ` back of the envelop ' estimate to complete the phenomenological existence proof of dark matter .",

    "it is apparent from fig .",

    ".     corresponds to @xmath43 ( for h=0.72 ) .",
    "it can be shown that for h=0.64 , the range reduces to roughly @xmath44 , while for @xmath45 the present cosmic epoch of @xmath41 corresponds to roughly @xmath46 .",
    "[ fig : t0x ] ]    figure [ fig : omegamattertoday ] clearly shows that for the present cosmic epoch @xmath47 .",
    "the standard model contribution @xmath10 falls too short to account for the obtained @xmath14 .",
    "this deficit is the dark matter .",
    "its existence is here arrived at without invoking the non - keplerian galactic rotational curves or the data on gravitational lensing  [  ] .     with @xmath34 . for the present cosmic epoch @xmath48 .",
    "[ fig : omegamattertoday ] ]    to emphasize this point further it is instructive to define    @xmath49    in figure  [ fig : omegadarkmattertoday ] , we exhibit its variation with @xmath34 for @xmath50 .",
    "for the present cosmic epoch we thus find @xmath51 . or , equivalently @xmath52 .",
    "that is , for the present epoch , the cosmic energy budget carries some three to six times as much dark matter as that contributed by the particles of the standard model of the high energy physics .",
    "much of the above considerations were confined to @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig : alpha3d6480 ] shows that a similar result holds for the entire observationally allowed range @xmath53 .",
    "that is , the arrived dark matter existence in the present cosmic epoch is not specific to @xmath37 .     as a function of @xmath34 for @xmath50 ; showing that there is roughly three to six times more dark matter as compared to the total contribution from the particles of the standard model of high energy physics .",
    "[ fig : omegadarkmattertoday ] ]    the whole analysis can be put in the following ` back of the envelop ' argument .",
    "for @xmath37 , the stellar age bound constrains the einsteinian cosmological constant  see eq .",

    "this gives @xmath55 . for the present epoch of roughly @xmath56 ( corresponding to @xmath54 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) yields @xmath57 .",
    "however , @xmath10 can only account for a small fraction of this obtained value .",
    "this leaves the fractional density @xmath58 to point towards some form of _ non - standard _ model matter in the non - relativistic form .",
    "this , by definition , is the astrophysical / cosmic dark matter  [ ] .",
    "the dramatic discordance between the calculated @xmath14 and the observed @xmath59 may be alternatively interpreted , not as pointing towards the existence of some non - standard model matter ( i.e. , dark matter ) , but as a breakdown of the general relativistic description of gravitation at large astrophysical and cosmological length scales .",
    "such a degeneracy in possible interpretations is best resolved by experimental and observational efforts . in the remainder of this essay",
    "we shall follow the dark - matter interpretation and find that it may indeed be pointing towards a very novel form of matter .",
    "all fermionic fields of the standard model of particle physics may be expressed in terms of the dirac spinors . formally , these spinors live in the @xmath60 representation space  [ ] . since the 1962 work of wigner it is known that these may not describe the entire physical reality of the high energy physics   [ ] . yet , till late last year , mostly due to non - trivial technical reasons and for an apparent lack of physical motivation ( i.e , before the suggestions of dark matter was taken seriously ) , no concrete construct of the type suggested by wigner existed for spin one half  [ ] .     as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath38 for @xmath50 .",
    "it shows that for almost the entire displayed range , @xmath61 and @xmath53 , the dark matter measuring parameter @xmath62 remains significantly away from zero .",
    "note parenthetically , that the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : t0gyr ] ) yields physically meaningless region just beyond @xmath63 around @xmath64 .",
    "this is the region at the lowest right hand corner of the above plot . and",
    ", only in this extreme region does @xmath62 hover around zero .",
    "[ fig : alpha3d6480 ] ]    to heuristically arrive at the conclusion of wigner s notes , as he called them , we first make the obvious observation that the indicated representation space supports various symmetries . of these ,",
    "the charge conjugation ( @xmath65 ) , the parity ( @xmath66 , and time reversal ( @xmath67 ) symmetries are the most relevant for the argument .",
    "the dirac spinors are the eigenspinors of the @xmath68 operator .",
    "now @xmath65 and @xmath68 when acting upon these spinors do not commute ; instead , they anti - commute .",
    "consequently , a quantum field built upon the eigenspinors of the @xmath65 operator should describe physically distinct type of new particles .",
    "a brief report on the construction of such a quantum field was recently presented in  [ ] while the monographic details were archived in  [ ] .",
    "the ensuing result states that the quantum field based on the eigenspinors of the @xmath65 operator does not carry the dirac propagator but , instead , that due to klein and gordon .",
    "this endows the new field with mass dimension one , rather than three half as for the dirac field .",
    "this happens despite the fact that the new field is fermionic , and carries spin one half .",
    "it is endowed with several novel features .",
    "a few of these are summarised in table i.    the first two properties enumerated in the second column are in accord to formal expectations based on wigner s work  [ ] , while da rocha and rodrigues have shown  [ ] that the new field is class 5 in lounesto spinor classification  [ ] .",
    "the field carries a ` minimal ' element of non - locality as required by the 1966 work of lee and wick  [ ] on wigner classes and may be important for resolving the ` horizon problem ' in cosmology .",
    "the third and the fourth results are intertwined .",
    "in contrast , they have emerged as a surprise . unexpectedly .",
    "the mass dimensionality of the new field immediately places it out of bounds for essentially all standard model interactions .",
    "the new particles can not be part of the standard model fermionic doublets because the mass dimensionalities mismatch .",
    "the most dominant interaction which the new particles can carry is with the higgs  [ ] .",
    "in addition , and unlike the standard model fermions where the quartic self interaction is suppressed by two powers of planck mass , the new particles carry an unsuppressed , and crucial  [ ] , quartic self interaction .",
    "this is because of their mass dimensionality one .",
    "these aspects endow the new particles with a darkness with respect to detectors made of the terrestrial standard model material and makes them natural dark matter candidates .",
    "due to its over abundance with respect to the standard model matter in the astrophysical and cosmological environments , the gravitational effects of dark matter remain as its primary signature .",
    "it is there that dark matter primarily manifests its presence and its consequences .",
    "given the role of higgs in its interactions with the new dark matter candidate one may expect its appearance at higgs factories . by the same token , its effects in early universe , particularly in the context of matter - antimatter asymmetry , may be profound .",
    "this is due to the mismatch of the @xmath69 phases at the interface with the standard - model matter . but here , our emphasis is on obtaining the darkness .",
    "the new construct provides it in a natural fashion without extending the spacetime symmetries , say to super - symmetry .",
    "lest these results acquire a mysterious life let us hasten to add a few remarks to help evaporate any such feeling .",
    "the entire physical content of the seventy six pages of published calculations and discussions in references  [ ] essentially resides in the fact that the @xmath65 , @xmath68 , and @xmath67 properties , and the emergent propagators , of the quantum fields is carried by the _ relative helicities and phases _ of the @xmath70- and @xmath71- transforming components of the @xmath60 spinors . for the eigenspinors of the @xmath68 ( i.e. , spinors underlying the dirac field ) , the relative helicities of the said components are _",
    "same_. for the eigenspinors of the @xmath65 ( i.e. , the spinors underlying the new spin one half field ) , the relative helicities of the said components are _ opposite_. the remaining degree of freedom in the relative phases between these spinorial components is fixed by requiring that these be such that they become @xmath68 and @xmath65 eigenspinors .",
    "once this is appreciated the eigenspinors in the rest frame , apart from a normalisation factor , are uniquely determined .",
    "the @xmath60 boost then furnishes us a set of complete spinors .",
    "one set of four spinors for the dirac case , and the other for the new construct .",
    "the propagator then turns out to depend on the respective spin sums . for the dirac case",
    "these spin sums have the usual @xmath72 form and yield the celebrated dirac propagator .",
    "for the new field these spin sums take the form @xmath73 , and yield the propagator    @xmath74    the limit @xmath75 is understood .",
    "a simple calculation using the eigenspinors of @xmath65 shows that @xmath76 is an odd function of @xmath77 : @xmath78 .",
    "this has the consequence that in the absence of a preferred direction   a circumstance which may be spoiled by existence , say , of an external gravitomagnetic field  the integration over @xmath76 vanishes .",
    "this leaves behind a klein - gordon propagator multiplied by an identity matrix in the @xmath60 representation space .    _",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> assuming the validity of the general relativistic description of gravitation on astrophysical and cosmological length scales , we analytically infer that the friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology with einsteinian cosmological constant , and a vanishing spatial curvature constant , unambiguously requires significant amount of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement is consistent with other indications for dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the same spacetime symmetries that underlie the freely falling frames of einsteinian gravity also provide symmetries , which for the spin one half representation space , furnish a novel construct that carries extremely limited interactions with respect to the terrestrial detectors made of the standard model material . </S>",
    "<S> both the ` luminous ' and ` dark ' matter turn out to be residents of the same representation space but they derive their respective ` luminosity ' and ` darkness ' from either belonging to the sector with @xmath0 , or to the sector with @xmath1 . </S>"
