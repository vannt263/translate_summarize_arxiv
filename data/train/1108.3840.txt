    "in particular , we generate phenomenological models for the number density of star forming galaxies as a function of uv and ly@xmath0 luminosity .",

    "this implies that the observed narrow - band excess of a star forming galaxy  and hence , whether it would be selected into a sample of laes  depends on its orientation relative to the observer .",
    "furthermore , modelling of the observed spectral profiles of lbgs near the ly@xmath0 line suggests that lbgs observed not to have any ly@xmath0 emission are not a separate class of galaxy .",
    "rather , these are also intrinsically strong ly@xmath0 emitters , in which radiative transfer effects transform the ly@xmath0 emission line into an absorption feature @xcite .",
    "together these observations indicate that the lbg and lae populations are intrinsically the same , and are only separated as a consequence of ly@xmath0 radiative transfer through opaque ( dusty ) media .",
    "the possibility that ly@xmath0 radiative transfer plays an important role in separating laes from lbgs is underlined by the observation of low surface brightness , extended ly@xmath0 halos around lbgs @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the ly@xmath0 radiation in these halos was emitted as nebular emission , which is then scattered to the observer in the ( outflowing ) circumgalactic medium . when the flux in these halos is properly accounted for , the total observed ly@xmath0 flux places most lbgs in the lae category .",
    "thus , current evidence suggests that the lbg and lae populations should be considered within the same theoretical framework .",

    "we constructed this model by combining observed luminosity functions of drop - out galaxies , with the observed rest - frame equivalent width ( rew ) probability distribution function ( pdf ) of drop - out galaxies at @xmath251 , and ` predicted ' the resulting ly@xmath0 luminosity function at @xmath18 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "on the other hand , we found that the overall redshift evolution of the laes was reproduced very well by our empirical model .",
    "encouraged by this result , we combine the best - fit model in our formalism with recent observed constraints of the ` lae fraction ' and predict number densities of laes at @xmath1 and @xmath241 . current measurements of the lbg luminosity functions translate to ly@xmath0 luminosity functions that are consistent with observed number counts of laes at @xmath1 , but which are still very uncertain .",
    "nevertheless the uv lf of lbgs can be used to provide empirical guidance for future surveys aiming to discover ly-@xmath0 galaxies at the highest redshifts .",
    "we conclude that modeling laes with simple rew and luminosity cuts can lead to ( significant ) changes to the predicted number density of laes .",
    "theorists will therefore need to make more careful account of observational selection in order to produce reliable models of the observed population .",

    "the _ thick dashed lines _",

    "the figure shows that our fitting formula provides a good fit to the bright sample , but significantly underpredicts the number of large ew systems in the ` faint ' sample ( fig  [ fig : appewpdf2 ] ) .",
    "this is because our fitting formula adopts rew@xmath262  , while the best fit to this subsample is rew@xmath263 (see the _ inset _ ) . on the other hand",

    "this choice for the normalization constraint allows us to describe the @xmath37dependence of the observed shape and normalization of the ly@xmath0 rew pdf at rew@xmath265 with one single parameter , namely rew@xmath260 ( we keep @xmath86 constant within this range ) .",
    "however , as we show next this single parameter description breaks down at fainter ( @xmath266 ) magnitudes .",
    "* stark et al . (",
    "2010 ) found that the rew - pdf is sensitive to @xmath37 .",
    "this dependance is relatively weak in the range @xmath267 , but strong from @xmath268 .",

    "the _ dotted curves _ show the model when we increase or decrease the parameter @xmath271 by 4  . note that the data point at @xmath272 lies a few @xmath25 above our fitting function , because this data point lies significantly above the data at @xmath273 .",
    "forcing better agreement with this data point therefore automatically results in worse agreement with the data at fainter uv magnitudes .",
