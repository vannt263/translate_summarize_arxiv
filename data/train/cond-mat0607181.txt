    "ever since the concept of frustration - induced `` spin liquids '' is introduced to the triangular lattice systems@xcite , the theoretical search for a special state without any types of long range ordering has been proceeded in the the strongly correlated systems under geometrical frustration@xcite .",
    "such liquids are now being explored experimentally in the materials like niga@xmath1s@xmath2@xcite and @xmath3-et@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath4@xcite .",
    "however , the competition among several orders towards their destruction often makes the system reconcile with another different type of ordering .",
    "simplest examples are the spins on frustrated lattices forming dimers@xcite , plaquettes@xcite , etc .",
    "most recent ones are reported on hard core bosons of a nematic ordering in frustrated square lattice@xcite as well as of supersolids in the triangular lattice@xcite .",
    "we also proposed a frustration induced novel charge liquid in a triangular lattice denoted as a `` pinball liquid''@xcite , which turned out to have very similar character with the above supersolids despite the difference in the statistics .",
    "this state has a coexistence of a wigner crystal - type of solid and itinerate liquid type of charges so that a phase separation is expected without any domain structures . in this paper",
    "we examine the filling dependent nature of this liquid in detail in the spinless fermion system and confirm the strong coupling picture .",
    "the present spinless fermion system is described by the @xmath5-@xmath6 model hamiltonian , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the annihilation operator of fermions and @xmath9 is its number operator .",
    "the summation is given over the nearest neighbor(nn ) pair sites on a triangular lattice with indices @xmath10 .",
    "together with the strong coupling argument , we perform the exact diagonalization on @xmath11 cluster with periodic boundary conditions , which could fully describe both the three fold and two fold type of periodicity which reside in the present system .",
    "since the size dependence of the energy is confirmed to be very small and also the correlation function shows a well converged character within a relatively short range in comparison with the parallel works@xcite , the present results are enough qualified to support the physical picture we present .        , in the formation of a pinball liquid at @xmath12 with @xmath13 as a function of ( a ) @xmath14 and ( b)@xmath15 , where @xmath15=8,12 corresonds to @xmath16=1/3 , 1/2 , respectively .",
    "the fitting by the power of @xmath14 is given in ( a ) , whose results are reflected in ( b ) as those of @xmath17 .",

    "the difference between pins and balls become small near half - filling .",
    ", width=321 ]",
    "in the strong coupling limit , @xmath29 , the system is identical with the classical ising @xmath30=1/2 spin system on a triangular lattice .",
    "the ground state is disordered due to macroscopic number of degenerate states@xcite which are classified into two groups according to their periodicity as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ; one portion is composed of two - fold striped states which have staggered alignment of charges in any one of three directions but is disordered in other two directions . this state has an order @xmath31-degeneracy .",
    "the others have a three sublattice structure represented by fig .  [ f1](b ) . here , as long as @xmath28 and @xmath22 sublattices are filled and empty , respectively , the configuration of the @xmath23-sites is chosen arbitrary .",
    "in addition , there are large number of contingents which include the irregular structure on @xmath28 and @xmath23 sublattices as shown in fig .  [ f1](c ) but still has a same binding energy . including all of them",
    ", the three sublattices can afford any fillings over @xmath0 without changing the binding energy , in sharp contrast to the strictly half - filled stripes .",
    "the introduction of @xmath32 drives the classical disordered system to a new ordered phase which we call a pinball liquid@xcite . for simplicity , we start from the @xmath33 case which has a well known unique ground state where only the @xmath28-sublattice is filled . then the extra binding energy @xmath34 is required to move a single charge from one of the @xmath28-sites , thus the `` pins '' on @xmath28-site form a solid .",
    "next we add a single extra charge on one of the empty sites .",
    "this charge can move to another nearest empty site without losing the binding energy .",
    "therefore once the filling is off @xmath33 , the system discontinuously becomes gapless .",
    "the simplest picture of the pinball liquid is that the extra charge moves around like a `` ball '' avoiding the `` pins '' on @xmath28 sublattice .",
    "the kinetic energy gain per single `` ball '' corresponds to the bandwidth of the honeycomb lattice which is obtained after depleting the @xmath28 sublattice(pinned sites ) from the original lattice . with increasing filling the energy gain",
    "will be affected by the correlation among `` balls '' .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the estimation of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is numerically obtained by the diagonalization of eq.([tvham ] ) and the classical binding energy is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath15 denotes the electron number .",
    "the kinetic energy gain , @xmath38 , increases with increasing number of filling , i.e. the number of `` balls '' that can move . in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) we fit the data by the power of @xmath14 as , @xmath39 , where @xmath8 are fitting constants and @xmath40 gives the kinetic energy gain in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the obtained results at @xmath17 are given as a function of filling in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) together with @xmath41 s at finite @xmath6 . in the strong coupling limit",
    ", @xmath42 seems to follow the band energy of the honeycomb lattice at @xmath43 which supports the simplest pinball liquid picture we discussed above in the dilute case . as the filling approaches @xmath44",
    ", @xmath41 deviates from the honeycome one and saturates .",
    "this is because the correlation among `` balls '' increases to avoid the loss of @xmath6 as they becomes dense .",
    "then the balls can no longer move independently with each other and the wave functions become relatively localized so that the kinetic energy gain do not increase much with @xmath15 .",
    "although we see shortly that the pinball liquid is dominant over @xmath45 , its stability is still the most difficult to be guaranteed at half - filling because the largest number of contingents exists that might destroy the `` pins '' to some extent .",
    "we remind that the charges on @xmath23 and @xmath22 sites can hop by @xmath5 to its neighboring site as in fig .",
    "[ f3](a ) without the loss of binding energy when the neighboring population number of that charge remains unchanged .",
    "the example is given in fig .",
    "[ f3](b ) where some of the balls can move in the direction indicated by arrows .",
    "this rule also holds for the charges on @xmath28 site in the irregular contingent states , e.g. when three neighboring hexagons have special kind of configuration as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3](c ) .",
    "fortunately , in this case the contingent can not destroy the `` pins '' completely .",
    "this is because the charges which was originally a `` pin '' can not go more than one site away without freezing the configuration of original two neighbors .",
    "otherwise , one of these neighbors refills the original `` pin '' and the `` balls '' can move again smoothly . therefore",
    "although the local fluctuation squeeze the amplitude of `` pins '' they remain relatively stable@xcite and the collective destruction of `` pins '' does not take place . considering the particle - hole symmetry",
    ", the same discussion holds by regarding the @xmath22-sublattice(hole ) as `` pins '' .",
    "therefore , the `` pins '' and `` balls '' are not completely fixed and free , respectively , at half - filling .",
    "to further compare the stability of the pinball liquid under different fillings , we present the numerical estimation of order parameters for several number of charges @xmath15=8 - 12 at @xmath12 , which correspond to the fillings , @xmath16=1/3 - 1/2 . as discussed elsewhere , the pinball liquid is characterized by a three - body correlation@xcite .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows such function , @xmath46 , at @xmath13 .",
    "as we see in fig  [ f4](a ) , the amplitude of `` pins''(@xmath28 ) near @xmath16=1/3 is almost 1 which decays only little with distance .",
    "this sturdily supports the strong coupling picture and is also consistent with the fact that the kinetic energy gain in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) at low fillings is almost identical with the honeycomb lattice band energy . with increasing @xmath15 the oscillation amplitude of @xmath26",
    "becomes suppressed and has larger decay .",
    "it is more clearly displayed in fig  [ f4](b ) as a function of @xmath15 for several choices of @xmath6 .",
    "however , the amplitude of `` pins '' are always larger for larger @xmath6 , and we expect a long range order in the bulk limit at least in the very strong coupling region even at half - filling .",
    "we displayed the filling dependence of the new gapless charge liquid denoted as pinball liquid , which was reported very recently at @xmath47 . due to the particle - hole symmetry ,",
    "the same results are obtained for @xmath48 by just regarding holes as `` pins '' . despite the anticipation that the increasing number of particles towards half - filling might drive the `` pins '' towards destruction , the kinetic energy gain and the correlation function",
    "indicates that the pinball picture still holds while the balls become strongly correlated .",
