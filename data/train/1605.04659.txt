    "the columbia phase diagram plot  @xcite provides a visualization of the finite - temperature phases of 2 + 1 flavor qcd at zero chemical potential in the plane of the light quark mass and strange quark mass @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) . in the small quark mass region",
    ", it is believed that the transition is of first order  @xcite , which turns into a region of crossover as quark masses are increased .",
    "the boundary which separates the two regions is the critical endline ( cel ) which belongs to the z@xmath8 universality class  @xcite .",
    "there is a longstanding issue that the results for critical endpoint ( cep ) at the su(3)-flavor symmetric point ( @xmath9 ) obtained by wilson type and staggered type fermion actions are inconsistent  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have investigated cep with degenerate @xmath10 dynamical flavors of non - perturbatively @xmath0-improved wilson fermion action , and determined its location by the intersection points of kurtosis for the temporal sizes @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the continuum extrapolation implies a non - zero value @xmath14  mev for the pseudoscalar meson mass .",
    "scaling violations are large , however , necessitating further studies at larger @xmath1 to obtain conclusive results for cep .    in this article , we explore the properties of cel away from @xmath9 . in particular",
    "we ask how cel curve away from @xmath9 .",
    "this is a first step to obtain a comprehensive view on the relation of cel and the physical point for which the strange quark mass is significantly heavier than the degenerate up - down quark mass . to set the stage for our analysis ,",
    "let us consider the kurtosis @xmath15 of some quantity @xmath16 which can be either a gluonic or quark quantity .",
    "the kurtosis generally depends on the quark masses @xmath17 , and its taylor expansion around @xmath9 will have a form @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the difference from the su(3)-symmetric value @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , if one varies the quark masses while keeping the average over the three quark masses , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20 , the kurtosis remains unchanged up to second order in the variation of the quark masses . for degenerate up and down quark mass",
    ", we have @xmath21 , and hence the change becomes @xmath22 this means that the slope of cel at @xmath9 should take the value @xmath3 on the columbia plot .",
    "there are no such constraints on the second derivative of cel with respect to @xmath5 at @xmath9 .",
    "if it is positive , cel would smoothly curve up to the tricritical point @xmath23 located on the axis for the strange quark mass around which cel is expected to behave as @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "so far , a lattice qcd result obtained by using staggered fermions at @xmath11 with a lattice spacing @xmath25 fm supports such a curve  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sim ] we present the simulation details including the parameters and the simulation algorithm .",
    "our numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] . in section  [ sec : sum ] , we provide a brief conclusion .",
    "to determine cel away from cep , we perform kurtosis intersection analysis using a multi - parameter , multi - ensemble reweighting method . the details of this method is described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "calculations are made at a temporal lattice size @xmath26 and the spacial sizes @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath10 degenerate flavors of dynamical quarks using the iwasaki gluon action  @xcite and the non - perturbatively @xmath0-improved wilson fermion action  @xcite .",
    "all observables for @xmath31 qcd are computed by using a @xmath32 reweighting .",
    "the periodic boundary condition is imposed for gluon fields while the anti - periodic boundary condition is employed for quark fields .",
    "we use a highly optimized hmc code  @xcite , applying mass preconditioning  @xcite and rhmc  @xcite , 2nd order minimum norm integration scheme  @xcite , putting the pseudo fermion action on multiple time scales  @xcite and a minimum residual chronological method  @xcite to choose the starting guess for the solver .",
    "we generate @xmath33 ensembles of @xmath34 trajectories on ha - pacs and coma at university of tsukuba , system e at kyoto university and primergy cx400 tatara at kyushu university .",
    "measurements are done at every 10th trajectory and statistical errors are estimated by the jackknife method with the bin size of @xmath35 configurations . in table  [ tab : ensemble ] , we summarize the simulation parameters and statistics .    .simulation parameters and statistics .",

    "we have investigated cel of the finite temperature phase transition of qcd with non - perturbatively @xmath0-improved wilson - clover fermion action around the su(3)-symmetric point at zero chemical potential and @xmath26 .",
    "our method of kurtosis intersection point analysis aided by multi - parameter , multi - ensemble reweighting works well . as results , we could precisely determine cel over a range @xmath36 sandwitching the su(3)-symmetric point at @xmath37 , and found @xmath3 for the slope and a positive second derivative around @xmath9 on the columbia plot .",
    "we need to add to remarks on our results .",
    "first , for zero temperature simulations , we used a slightly different @xmath38 than @xmath39 .",
    "we think that this difference will not change our conclusion since it is only an effect of 0.3% or so in hadron mass values .",
    "second , our study is conducted at just single lattice spacing of @xmath2 fm .",
    "we are pursuing simulations with a larger @xmath1 to obtain conclusive results , especially for the second derivative .",
    "finally , the physical point at @xmath40 is quite far from the su(3)-symmetric point .",
    "thus , @xmath31 simulations are needed to investigate cel as it approaches the physical point .",
