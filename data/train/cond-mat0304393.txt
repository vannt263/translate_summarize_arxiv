    "the main goal of this paper is to show that the enhanced electron - ripplon coupling in the bubble leads to a new solid phase , a lattice of ripplonic polarons , that is distinct from the electron wigner lattice , and to investigate the properties of this phase .    using pressure",

    "the self - induced trapping potential of the electron on the helium surface is manifested by the appearance of a dimple in the helium surface underneath the electron , much like the deformation of a rubber sheet when a person is pulled down on it by a gravitational force .",
    "the resulting quasiparticle consists of the electron together with its dimple and can be called a ripplonic polaron or ripplopolaron @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) for the ripplopolarons is very similar to the frhlich hamiltonian describing polarons @xcite ; the role of the phonons is now played by the ripplons .",

    "in their treatment of the electron wigner lattice embedded in a polarizable medium such as a semiconductors or an ionic solid , fratini and qumerais @xcite described the effect of the electrons on a particular electron through a mean - field lattice potential .",

    "a second assumption implicit in this approach is that the effects of exchange are neglected .",

    "we can expand this potential around the origin to find the small - amplitude oscillation frequency of the electron lattice : @xmath26 with the confinement frequency @xmath27 although this mean - field approach may seem crude , it has the distinct advantage that the ` phonon ' frequency @xmath28 of the electron lattice corresponds closely to the longitudinal plasmon frequency that can be derived using an entirely different approach based on a more rigorous study of the modes of oscillations of both the bubble and the charge distribution on the bubble surface .",
    "this frequency lies typically in the thz range and the lattice parameter @xmath22 in mebs ranges roughly from 10 to 100 nm . from this , and from the succesful application of this mean - field approach to polaron crystals in solids , we conclude that the approach based on that of fratini and qumerais describes the influence of the other electrons well in the framework of small amplitude oscillations of the electrons around their lattice point .",
    "the ( modified ) lindemann melting criterion suggests that the lattice will melt when the electrons are on average displaced more than ca .",

    "the hamiltonian for a ripplopolaron in a lattice on a _ locally flat _",
    "helium surface is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electron position operator .",
    "now that the lattice potential has been introduced , we can move on and include effects of the bubble geometry .",
    "if we restrict our treatment to the case of large bubbles ( with @xmath31 electrons ) such as those already experimentally observed @xcite , then both the ripplopolaron radius and the inter - electron distance @xmath22 are much smaller than the radius of the bubble @xmath32 .",
    "this gives us ground to use the locally flat approximation using the auxiliary model of a ripplonic polaron in a planar system described by ( [ h1 ] ) , but with a modified ripplon dispersion relation and an modified pressing field .",
    "in appendix a we provide a more detailed description of the electron - ripplon interaction on a sphere and discuss how the locally flat approximation ( [ h1 ] ) is linked to the exact expressions for the curved surface .",
    "essentially , we find for the modified ripplon dispersion relation in the meb : @xmath33 where @xmath32 is the equilibrium bubble radius which depends on the pressure and the number of electrons @xcite .",
    "the bubble radius is found by balancing the surface tension and the pressure with the coulomb repulsion @xcite . at zero pressure , it scales as @xmath34 and in the pressure - dominated regime ( @xmath35 ) it scales with pressure as @xmath36 .",
    "some typical values are given in table i. the modified electron - ripplon interaction amplitude in an meb is given by @xmath37 the effective electric pressing field pushing the electrons against the helium surface and determining the strength of the electron - ripplon interaction is @xmath38 some typical values for the pressing field and the dimensionless coupling constants are given in table i. note that the electric field in the bubble is larger than the typical pressing fields ( of the order of @xmath39 v / cm ) applied on electrons on a flat helium surface .",
    "thus , the electron - ripplon coupling will be stronger in the multielectron bubble .",
    "the modified ripplon dispersion relation ( and the dependence of the bubble radius on the number of electrons and the pressure ) was studied in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the stability of the multielectron bubble against surface deformational modes was investigated in detail in refs .",
    "these studies concluded that even though a large effective electric pressing field is present at zero pressure , the bubbles can be stable in contrast to the flat surface which can only sustain a moderate electric pressing field .",
    "the crucial differences that exist between the case of a ripplopolaron in the multielectron bubble and on the flat surface ( and that are preserved in the locally flat approximation ) are ( i ) the electric pressing field @xmath17 is stronger than that typically realised for electrons on helium films ( see table i ) and thus the electron - ripplon coupling is enhanced as compared to the normal film ; ( ii ) the interaction energy arising from the change in polarisation of the helium due to the displacement of the electron has a similar form , but is much weaker and can be neglected .",
    "in addition the electric field , and thus the electron - ripplon coupling increases as the bubble radius is decreased .",
    "thus , pressurizing the bubbles , which decreases the radius , also increases the electron - ripplon coupling strength ( rougly as @xmath40 ) . in the high - pressure regime ( @xmath35 ) , the bubble radius goes as @xmath36 and thus the electron - ripplon coupling increases as @xmath41 .",
    "the pressure provides a ` tuning knob ' to set the electron - ripplon interaction strength at a desired level .",
    "to gain insight into the nature of the wigner solid of ripplopolarons , we will analyse hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) first in the strong - coupling approach . in the next section , the more general and more accurate feynman variational path - integral method will be applied , generalizing the results of this section to finite temperature . noting that the frequency associated with the electron s motion , @xmath28 , is typically several orders of magniture larger than the frequency associated with the ripplons @xcite , @xmath42 , we can safely make the product ansatz for the wave function of the ripplopolaron in the lattice : @xmath43 . here",

    "the lattice of ripplopolarons on the one hand melts through dissociation of the ripplopolarons , and this melting line is almost temperature independent .",
    "the lattice of electrons on the other hand melts though either classical thermal motion ( when the temperature reaches a melting temperature of about 0.5 k ) , or through quantum melting when the density of electrons is large enough so that the extent of the zero - point motion becomes comparable to the lattice parameter . in the wigner lattice of the ripplopolarons on the one hand ,",
    "the particles are localized by the self - induced polaronic trapping potential ( the dimple ) due to the electron - ripplon interaction . in the wigner lattice of electrons",
    ", the electrons are localized through the coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "finally , the region in phase space where the ripplopolaron wigner lattice resides is different from the region where the electron wigner lattice is found .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , where the phase diagram drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] is extended to huge bubbles ( approaching the flat surface geometry ) . in the corner of largest @xmath73 ( @xmath130 @xmath131 mm , @xmath132 @xmath4 ) and lowest pressure ( @xmath133 pa ) , we find that an electron wigner lattice ( without individual dimples ) can still be formed below @xmath134 k. thus , the electron wigner lattice is recovered and the melting temperature derived from our treatment is in agreement with the experimentally observed temperature @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that , as the bubble is compressed , the electron wigner lattice will quantum melt because of the increased density of electrons .",
    "the region of phase space where the electron wigner lattice is present is separated from the region where the ripplopolaron wigner lattice is present by a region where the predicted phase is an electron liquid .",
    "the ripplopolaron liquid phase , as mentioned before , does not exist .",
    "since , as mentioned in the previous paragraph , our method does not allow us to study the crystal structure , we can not , in the electron wigner lattice phase , distinguish between the crystalline and the hexatic phase @xcite .    the new phase that we predict , the ripplopolaron wigner lattice",
    ", will not be present for electrons on a flat helium surface . at the values of the pressing field necessary to obtain a strong enough electron - ripplon coupling , the flat helium surface is no longer stable against long - wavelength deformations @xcite .",
    "multielectron bubbles , with their different ripplon dispersion and the presence of stabilizing factors such as the energy barrier against fissioning @xcite , allow for much larger electric fields pressing the electrons against the helium surface .",
    "the regime of @xmath73,@xmath125,@xmath72 parameters suitable for the creation of a ripplopolaron wigner lattice lies within the regime that would be achievable in recently proposed experiments aimed at stabilizing multielectron bubbles @xcite .",
    "the ripplopolaron wigner lattice and its melting transition might be detected by spectroscopic techniques @xcite probing for example the transverse phonon modes of the lattice @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the properties of ripplopolarons in a multielectron bubble in helium using path - integral methods similar to those developed for a lattice of polarons @xcite .",
    "expressions are derived for the free energy and the dimple shape of ripplopolarons in a wigner lattice in a multielectron bubble , as a function of temperature , externally applied pressure and number of electrons in the bubble .",
    "we find that , owing to the difference in the ripplon and longitudinal plasmon frequencies @xcite , the ripplopolarons exist only in a wigner crystallized state .",
    "this state differs from the wigner lattice of electrons , in that the electrons in the ripplopolaron wigner lattice are localized by the electron - ripplon interaction rather than the coulomb repulsion , and in that the melting occurs through the dissociation of the ripplopolarons . as electron - ripplon interaction is weakened ( for example by reducing the externally applied pressure on the multielectron bubble ) the electrons can shed their localized dimple and the ripplopolaron wigner state is destroyed .",
    "the melting transition is shown to occur in a region of phase space that is accessible to recently proposed experiments for stabilizing multielectron bubbles .    * acknowledgements *",

    "the modes of oscillation of the bubble surface will be called ` ripplons ' in analogy with the surface oscillations on a flat helium surface . in general , the deformed bubble surface can be described by a function @xmath135 which gives the distance , from the center of the bubble , of the bubble surface in the direction determined by the spherical angles @xmath136 .",
    "the deformation @xmath137 from spherical symmetry can be expanded in spherical harmonics @xmath138 : @xmath139 in this expression , @xmath32 is the angle - averaged radius , and @xmath140 is the amplitude of the deformational mode corresponding to the spherical harmonic @xmath141 . in the summation ,",

    "thus , for small amplitude deformations of the bubble , we find that the shape of the bubble oscillates with frequencies given by ( [ ripfreq ] ) . taking the bare ripplon frequency ( without the effect of the interaction with electrons ) and putting @xmath148 ( with @xmath149 a constant )",
    "we find @xmath150 this dispersion relation corresponds to the ripplon dispersion on the flat surface , with the difference that there is in our dispersion relation no gravitational term , but a term related to the pressure on the bubble .",
    "the interaction energy between the ripplons and the electrons in the multielectron bubble can be derived from the following considerations : ( i ) the distance between the layer electrons and the helium surface is fixed ( the electrons find themselves confined to an effectively 2d surface anchored to the helium surface @xcite ) and ( ii ) the electrons are subjected to a force field , arising fromt the electric field of the other electrons . for a spherical bubble ,",
    "this electric field lies along the radial direction and equals @xmath151 a bubble shape oscillation will displace the layer of electrons anchored to the surface .",
    "the interaction energy which arises from this , equals the displacement of the electrons times the force @xmath19 acting on them .",
    "thus , we get for the interaction hamiltonian @xmath152 here @xmath137 is the radial displacement of the surface in the direction given by the spherical angle @xmath76 ; and @xmath153 is the ( angular ) position operator for electron @xmath154 . the displacement can be rewritten using ( [ radius ] ) and we find @xmath155 using the relation @xmath156 the interaction hamiltonian can be written in the suggestive form @xmath157 with the electron - ripplon coupling amplitude for a meb given by @xmath158      substituting @xmath159 into ( [ hint ] ) , we get @xmath160 ( \\hat{a}_{\\ell , m}+\\hat{a}_{\\ell , -m}^{+ } )   . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , we consider the limit of a bubble so large that the surface becomes flat on all length scales of interest .",
