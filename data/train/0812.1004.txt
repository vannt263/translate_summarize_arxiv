    "hitherto , there has been no specific use or test of the continuity of the fourier spectrum . as stationary states , even conduction band energy levels in metals and semiconductors",
    "are merely quasicontinuous .",
    "the travelling wave energies are assumed to form a continuum in scattering and photoelectricity theories , but only a quasicontinuous subset actually interacts with metallic or semiconductor states , as represented by quantum interaction matrices of mixed cardinality . the doppler effect and the lorentz transformation have been likewise formulated primarily in terms of their impact on individual pure tones present in the spectrum . since all observations are necessarily of finite precision , specific use of spectral continuity requires involving a rate of continuous drift of frequency or wavelength as a factor .",
    "however , though spectrometer drift is routinely corrected by recalibration and has been especially well studied in astronomical instrumentation , the observational impact of a continuously changing frequency or wavelength selection has not been specifically examined .",
    "the principal result presented here is that any frequency selective device with an ongoing drift of selection will cause received spectra to be variously and simultaneously scaled _ in proportion to their source distances _ to subsequent detectors .",
    "this is remarkable as the hubble redshifts of astronomy are the only known instances of frequency shifts indicative of source distances . as a general effect of tunable or `` fourier switching '' optics ,",
    "it promises to add a whole new dimension in technology .",
    "the reason is that the subsequent detectors will integrate instantaneous electric or magnetic field values from the successive sinusoids instantaneously presented by the drifting selector , and these sinusoids would differ in both frequency and phase .",
    "current recalibration procedures , including those used for the space telescopes , were designed to at most correct for frequency variation , as integration across frequencies was never considered . under a changing selection , however , each successive integrated field value comes from _ the sinusoid of the instantaneously selected frequency at its instantaneous received phase_. the waveform constructed by the integration will therefore follow the changing selection with a _ phase acceleration _ defined by the rate of change times the slope of the received phase spectrum .",
    "phase acceleration defines frequency shifts , and the phase spectrum slope is a direct asymptotic measure of the source distance , since the total path delay presents phase offsets proportional to frequency times the distance , and the offsets would eventually exceed all initial phase differences",
    ". the shifts would be therefore proportional to individual source distances in all observations with a changing frequency or wavelength selection !",
    "the slowness of any uncorrected residual drifts and the enormous speed of light together keep this frequency shift error undetectably small for ground sources .",
    "however , at the path delays and distances of cosmology , even drifts on geological time scales should cause errors comparable to the hubble redshifts . such drifts would occur from ordinary creep in metals and glasses , which is currently uncorrected for except under enormous stresses or high temperatures .",
    "the shifts for local calibration referents , used for both laboratory spectrometers and space telescopes , would be undetectable owing to the small distance .",
    "i show below that these shifts exactly fit both the cosmological acceleration and time dilation , and even satisfy tolman s test @xcite for the reality of the expansion !",
    "the very notion of exploiting phase differences across wavelengths or frequencies is generally new .",
    "holography , synthetic aperture imaging and interferometry all involve phase differences at individual wavelengths .",
    "pulse radar imaging exploits phase differences across the frequency comb arising from the pulse repetition , but only indirectly via a fourier inversion @xcite .",
    "the spectral phase profile must be characterized in ultrashort laser pulse technology , but only for the subsequent pulse shaping use .",
    "optical devices are expected to soon reach tuning speeds sufficient to realize these shifts on earth , and their validation would have immense theoretic and practical implications .",
    "the distance proportionality makes them the general time domain analogue of spatial parallax .",
    "they would enable separation of signals from cochannel transmitters by transmitter distance and instant range determination by physical means independently of the signal content , in analogy to the known angular separation of incoming signals and the instant determination of transmitter bearing using directional antennae .",
    "they would thus enable arbitrary band - limited communication simultaneously between arbitrary pairs of locations , by physics instead of modulation and multiplexing in time or frequency domains .",
    "this would not only help realize shannon s vision of simultaneous point - to - point communication @xcite , but would multiply channel capacities by their concurrent reuse by noncolocated transmitters .",
    "they could be used independently , or in combination with all current technologies like tdma , fdma , cdma or wdma in air , space or optical fibres , for multiplying bandwidths .",
    "the physical plane separation of signals by source distance would also endow receivers with inherent immunity from in - channel noise and jamming .",
    "they would additionally simplify passive radar and sonar by obviating computation intensive path time correlations with multiple sources , and enabling aperture synthesis without phase reference .",
    "another class of potential applications for the proportional shifts is as frequency and wavelength transformers .",
    "transformers could be constructed to turn radio , terahertz or infrared wavelengths into visible , or visible into ultraviolet or x - ray wavelengths , or the other way around , with accuracy and continuous tunability .",
    "wavelength transformation or scaling could be used both for imaging and diagnosis , by scaling received wavelengths to values more suitable for observation and analysis , and for synthesis or generation , by scaling the wavelengths of available sources to values desired in any particular application .",
    "for example , we might obtain coherent x - ray beams by scaling optical lasers , or high power coherent infrared or optical beams by scaling up microwaves .",
    "l70 mm    the rest of this paperis organized as follows .",
    "the continuity of real travelling wave spectra is established in section [ s : cont ] , as we propose practical use of it for the first time .",
    "section [ s : beat ] shows that the spectral continuity implies the presence of full path length information in received spectra in the form of the slope of phase spectrum .",
    "section [ s : shift ] describes how this path length information can be transformed into innovative spectral shifts by continuous change of the instantaneous frequency or wavelength selections in a receiver or observing instrument .",
    "sections [ s : comm]-[s : veri ] discuss the applications of the shifts and a theoretical verification .",
    "broader implications including time dilation in the doppler effect , and to cosmology are briefly discussed in section [ s : broad ] .",
    "transmission of information or energy by a travelling waveform requires that the waveform begin at a definite instant at a source location and end at a later instant at a receiver location .",
    "[ f : travelwave ] illustrates the idea .",
    "a finite real - valued waveform @xmath0 is shown starting at instant @xmath1 at a source located at the origin @xmath2 , and propagating all the way to a receiver at @xmath3 .",
    "the waveform is shown at successive instants @xmath4 , @xmath5 , ",
    ", @xmath6 when it arrives at the receiver .",
    "the ordinary notation for a travelling waveform as @xmath7 does not expressly limit its existence to a total interval of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distance between the source and the receiver and @xmath10 denotes the entire duration of the waveform at the source or at the receiver . without this express limitation ,",
    "the waveform appears to continue to exist for @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the usual portrayal of signals as time - varying functions also makes it hard to notice that a travelling waveform is equivalently a spatial function @xmath13 with a finite compact support @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "in physical terms , a discontinous spectrum means that either the spectrum contains intervals of zero amplitude , or has abrupt changes in amplitude , so that either the amplitude slope or the phase slope is undefined or diverges to @xmath15 at one or more points .",
    "the continuity is needed for the existence of the phase spectrum slope , on which the innovative method of section [ s : shift ] depends , and is assured by the following basic result from fourier theory .",

    "[ f : fcont ] .",
    "the requisite continuity of the phase spectrum is thus assured for travelling waveforms on grounds that _ their finite duration makes their spectra continuous and infinite_. for ranging applications , it suffices to have a finite , well - defined phase spectrum slope at one or more frequencies . for communication and wavelength transformation applications",
    ", the slope must exist over the entire spectrum , barring an at most countable subset of frequencies , whose contribution in the inverse fourier transform would be vanishingly small .    in fig .",
    "[ f : fcont ] , we have also accounted for the finiteness of real pulse widths , which imposes an overall @xmath27 profile ( broken line ) on the spectrum . this outer profile limits the bandwidth in digital communication , since a narrower bandwidth would widen pulses and reduce the bit rate .",
    "the inner sinc profiles from the duration of transmission have never needed consideration in the past as they overlap the thermal linespreads of natural sources and noise and clock jitter in communication .",
    "the method of section [ s : shift ] extracts coherent information from these linespreads .",
    "lemma [ t : sourceinfo ] below explains how even strictly periodic waveforms can transmit absolute source distance information .",
    "this is ordinarily quite unintuitive , and depends on being able to choose infinitesimally close pairs of wavelengths .",
    "lemma [ t : phaseslope ] establishes more particularly that the slope of the phase spectrum gives a direct measure of the source distance , and is the actual basis of the method of section [ s : shift ] .",
    "the spectral continuity property established above guarantees the existence of both infinitesimally close wavelength pairs and phase spectrum slopes .",
    "l50 mm    both lemmas are more generally applicable to periodic waveforms , which can not of themselves represent travelling waveforms .",
    "however , decomposition by the fourier transform leads to sinusoidal components which are periodic , and other periodic functions are often used in signal processing .",
    "the intuition in lemma [ t : sourceinfo ] is that _ the wavelength of the beat wave between infinitesimally close wavelength pairs is itself infinite , which makes the beat wave aperiodic_.    fig .",
    "[ f : periodic ] illustrates how a known initial phase identifies the possible locations of a wave source , and thus partially determines its absolute location .",
    "consider a function @xmath13 which is periodic with the period @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 for integral values of @xmath30 .",
    "the generalized phase @xmath31 of @xmath32 at an arbitrary point @xmath33 would be simply the scaled normalized value @xmath34 , relative to the origin , which we may choose , without loss of generality , as the location of our receiver .",
    "if we determine the form of @xmath32 , and its phase at the receiver location , we would be able to compute @xmath32 at any offset @xmath33 in the direction of propagation . if @xmath35 denotes the known initial phase of the periodic component , in the overall decomposition , then the set of the possible locations of the source is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the set of integers .",
    "r50 mm    another useful quantity is the density of @xmath38 , which is simply @xmath39 , because the lower the density , the less ambiguity we would have in locating the source within a given coordinate range .",
    "for example , if we knew by another means that the source might be in the coordinate interval @xmath40 , the set of possible locations could be reduced , by a robust determination of the phase of @xmath32 , to @xmath41 . _",
    "the ambiguity in localizing the source would be _",
    "@xmath42 , where @xmath43 represents the length of the interval .",
    "the source would be perfectly localized in the distance interval @xmath40 if the ambiguity were zero .",
    "incidentally , as accurate determination of phase is difficult , and exact analogue comparison of a real valued quantity is in any case impossible , we should more precisely represent the set of possible locations in terms of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the uncertainty in the phase measurement .",
    "however , this uncertainty is actually inconsequential as the ambiguity comes from repetitions of the wave period .",
    "consider that when @xmath32 is a sinusoid , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , each positive ( or negative ) `` lobe '' of the sinusoid identifies an interval likely containing a point source ( fig .",
    "[ f : sineinfo ] , top ) . if we improved the phase resolution to select a quarter cycle , as shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ f : sineinfo ] , we would have obtained @xmath48 bits of information to locate the source within each cycle , but would not have identified its specific cycle .",
    "_ the ambiguity in terms of localizing the source down to a specific cycle is thus independent of the precision with which phase can be determined_.    any periodic function would similarly have an infinite ambiguity in terms of localizing the source to a specific cycle .",

    "irrationally related _ periods can not be periodic .",
    "since rationally related periods constitute only a dense subset of the 2-d real number continuum @xmath57 , the availability of absolute source distance information from a truly continuous spectral decomposition can not be ruled out !",

    "we would therefore have @xmath66 i.e. , we can reduce this ambiguity by simply choosing @xmath60 close enough to @xmath28 , and making sure the @xmath60 component has amplitude close to that of @xmath28 so that equations ( [ e : trigbeat ] ) can be applied . by lemma [ t : cont ] , the spectrum of a travelling waveform must be both continuous and infinite .",
    "hence , we can in principle choose @xmath60 arbitrarily close to @xmath28 , and be also assured of equal amplitude .",
    "doing so would make @xmath67 arbitrarily small , including zero , since @xmath68 i.e. , close enough to @xmath28 , provided @xmath69 .",
    "we would also need a way to determine the initial phase value @xmath35 of the beat wave .",
    "the continuity of the travelling waveform spectrum permits a reasonable assumption that the initial phases of adjacent sinusoids would be close as well .",
    "that is , we may assume the initial phase offset @xmath70 in equations ( [ e : trigbeat ] ) as @xmath71 .",
    "then , regardless of what phases the sinusoids started with at the source , their initial phase difference , which gives the initial phase @xmath35 of their beat wave , must be zero .",
    "a single measurement of the beat wave phase thus suffices to uniquely determine the source location within @xmath62 .",
    "lemma [ t : sourceinfo ] only establishes the existence of absolute source distance information in a travelling wave spectrum .",

    "an inseparable property of these green s functions , which hitherto had little significance of its own , is that _ all of the component sinusoids would have the same starting phase of zero _ , as the phase factor @xmath94 in the green s functions does not include a phase offset .",
    "this is more general than the zero starting phase of differential beat waves , and more particularly implies that the phase offsets of the green s function solutions at a distance @xmath33 from the point source would be equal to @xmath95 , and hence proportional to frequency , since @xmath96 . as a result",
