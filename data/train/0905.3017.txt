    "we have presented homogeneous @xmath0 ccd photometry in the field of nine galactic open clusters , obtained with the purpose of estimating , in many cases for the first time , their fundamental parameters . in most cases ,",
    "this is the first ccd study in the cluster region .",
    "we have performed a star count analysis of these fields to assess the clusters reality as over - densities of stars with respect to the field , and to estimate their radii . by means of comparison fields , and applying a statistical subtraction procedure ,",
    "we have constructed field star decontaminated cmds for these clusters .",
    "we complemented this data - set with photometry from 2mass archive to test and strenghten our findings .",
    "the analysis of the optical and ir cmds , together with the results from the star counts , allowed us to determine estimates star clusters basic parameters .",
    "+ our finding can be summarized as follows :    @xmath2 all clusters are found to be real , and of intermediate or old age ;    @xmath2 hogg  19 is the oldest cluster of the sample , with an age around 2.5 gyr ; the existence of such an old cluster in a hostile environment as the inner galaxy is puzzling ;    @xmath2 lynga  4 is the most heavily reddened cluster in the sample , and we could detect it only in the ir ;    @xmath2 trumpler  20 has been found to be quite an interesting cluster , much similar to ngc  7789 .",
    "the most interesting result is the presence of a double red clump , which deserves further investigation .",
    "this investigation emphasizes the difficulty to study the inner regions of the galaxy in the mere optical domain .",
    "we show , however , that the combination of star counts and cmds in the optical and ir , with common knowledge of the spiral structure of our galaxy , is quite an effective strategy to distinguish real star clusters from over - densities produced by the patchy distribution of dust , gas and stars in spiral arms .",
    "+ present and future wide area surveys in the ir , conducted by ukidss ( lawrence et al . 2007 ) and vista ( mcpherson et al . 2004 )",
    "consortia , will certainly provide more suitable data to discover and study new star clusters in the inner galaxy .",

    "<S> the most interesting cases detected by our study are , perhaps , that of trumpler  20 , which seems to be much older than previously believed , as indicated by its prominent -and double- red clump ; and that of hogg  19 , a previously overlooked old open cluster , whose existence in such regions of the milky way is puzzling .    _ </S>",
