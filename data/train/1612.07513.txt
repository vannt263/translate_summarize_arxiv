    "however , the radiation is often contaminated by interstellar polarization ( isp ) .",
    "in addition , the galactic extinction makes it difficult to measure the intrinsic spectral shape of microquasars in the optical and nir bands .",
    "it is important to investigate the actual properties of the interstellar medium to determine the precise emission model for microquasars .",
    "v404  cygni ( a.k.a , gs  2023 + 338 ) is a well - known x - ray black hole binary with @xmath5 masses @xcite at a distance of 2.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "it showed extreme outbursts in june 2015 , with large amplitude variability and a time scale of seconds to hours in the radio , optical , and x - ray bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast to the large variation in total flux , there were very small variability of polarization in the optical or nir bands .",
    "@xcite reported no significant variability of polarization in the optical and nir bands , while @xcite and @xcite detected very small polarization variation in limited time intervals which were not covered by @xcite .",
    "this implies that disk or optically - thick synchrotron emission ( or both ) dominated in the nir regime .    to obtain an accurate spectrum in the optical / nir band , careful estimation of the galactic extinction",
    "is needed .",

    "@xcite , however , suggested the galactic absorption of @xmath7 by nir - band photometry of v404  cygni and a tripped giant model .    here , we estimated the color excess of v404  cygni by measuring interstellar polarization and color excess for the surrounding field stars .",
    "the distinctive feature of our method is that we do not require any assumption of intrinsic luminosity and color of comparison stars in microquasars . in this paragraph",

    "the relation between color excess originating in the galactic extinction and isp has been well studied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a wavelength at peak pd is related to the ratio of extinction and color excess , defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is extinction in the v - band and @xmath10 is the color excess for @xmath11 color . to estimate the contribution of interstellar extinction and polarization for v404  cygni , we performed optical and nir polarimetric observations of v404  cygni and nearby stars . first , we measured the color excess and isp for the field stars around v404  cygni and clarified the relations between these parameters .",
    "then , we estimated the color excess of v404  cygni from its pd value . from a measurement of the wavelength dependence of v404  cygni , we estimated the @xmath12 value with the serkowski - law . using these two parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath12",

    "each observation consisted of a sequence of exposures at four position angles of the achromatic half - wave plates , 0.0 , 22.5 , 45.0 , and 67.5 degree .",
    "the field of view of honir for polarimetric observation consisted of five rectangles ( 0.8 arcmin @xmath16 10 arcmin ) separated on the side by 0.8 arcmin .",
    "we confirmed that instrumental polarization of honir was less than 0.1% in the optical band and 0.2% in the nir - band by observation of unpolarized standard stars ( hd212311 and g191b2b , * ? ? ?",
    "we also corrected the instrumental depolarization by measurement of an artificially 100% polarized star , with a wire - grid polarizer for each band .",
    "the origins of the polarization angle were calibrated with the strong polarized stars , hd150193 and hd19820 @xcite .",
    "each measured pd and pa after all calibrations were consistent with catalog values of strong polarized stars , with uncertainties of @xmath17 and @xmath18 degrees , respectively .",

    "uvot data were reduced following the standard procedure for ccd photometry .",
    "counts were extracted from an aperture of 5 arcsec radius for all filters and annulus background regions were sampled 27 arcsec away from object stars , and then converted to a flux using the standard zero points @xcite .",
    "to determine the spectral type of the field stars , we performed low - resolution spectroscopic observations of field stars with hiroshima one - shot wide - field polarimeter ( howpol , 0.41 - 0.94 @xmath19 m , @xmath20 , * ? ? ? * ) on the kanata telescope from 24 to 30 july 2015 . to investigate the relation between pd and color excess , we selected four bright field stars , with weak to strong polarization ( @xmath21 in the @xmath22-band ) , for optical spectroscopic observation .",
    "in addition , we intensively performed spectroscopic observation of all field stars which have strong polarization ( @xmath23 in the @xmath22-band ) in order to securely compare with v404  cyg . in total",

    ", we can see that there is a general increase in pd with color and color excess .    the field stars fs1 , fs2 , fs4 , and fs7 show similar properties of pd and color excess ( see table [ tab : fsres ] ) . from these results , we estimated the color excess of v404  cygni . using average value of color excess of the field stars",
    "fs1 , fs2 , fs4 and fs7 , we estimated the color excess of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the pd value of @xmath30% for v404  cygni .",
    "these values are consistent with the value derived by spectroscopic observations of a comparison star for v404  cygni @xcite .",
    "we note that these color excess values are derived based on the pd value during the outburst .",
    "the aligned polarization angle and wavelength dependence of polarization implies that the polarization observed in v404  cygni originated in the interstellar medium ( this is also discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , @xcite reported that pd value in quiescent state is @xmath31% on 2016 may 26 .",
    "this value is slightly low compared with the pd value in 2015 outburst and several short time variability of pd which probably originated in the jet during the 2015 outburst were also reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but variability of pd are relatively rare phenomenon during the outburst and its variability amplitude of pd is small ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we assumed that most of polarization originated in isp . in this section",

    ", we identified the spectral type and determined the color excess of the field stars around v404  cygni . the color excess and pd showed a good correlation , and we estimated the color excess of v404  cygni as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which corresponds to @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "we also measured the upper limit of peak wavelength for multi - band pd as @xmath35 .",
    "it is known that a relation between @xmath36 and @xmath12 is described with the empirical formula @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we obtained the upper limit of @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , using another empirical relation of the maximum value of @xmath40 mag@xmath41 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath42 is the pd value at @xmath43-band , we obtained the lower limit of @xmath44 .",
    "finally , we obtained an extinction value of @xmath1 .",
    "this extinction value is consistent with the value of @xmath45 reported in @xcite , but slightly low compared with the value of @xmath46 reported in @xcite . from x - ray observation",

    "is estimated with @xmath51 and this value is also consistent with x - ray observation of integrated hydrogen column density of @xmath52 @xmath50 during the outburst in 2015 @xcite .",
    "in general , measurements of the galactic extinction for x - ray binary systems are model - dependent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , our method does not include the uncertainties caused by the emission model of a comparison of stars and disks as it independent from the accurate intrinsic luminosity of binary systems .",
    "our method is applicable to other galactic transients that have no intrinsic polarization in the optical band .",
    "the typical value of the interstellar pa within 3 degrees of v404  cygni is about @xmath53 degrees ( stellar polarization catalogs , * ? ? ?",
    "compared with this perspective trend of polarization in the galactic plane , it is implied that local isp around v404  cygni is not irrelevant to the global galactic isp . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum pd of the isp in the galactic plane within 3 degrees for v404  cygni is about @xmath54 for hd  331976 at @xmath55 .",
    "of course , this may be due to a lack of measurement of stellar polarization in this region ( we have only 22 sources in the stellar polarization catalog within 3 degrees of v404  cygni ) . however , the measured local isp of @xmath56 for v404  cygni in _ v_-band and the color excess of @xmath57 are among the highest values in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the tendency of the bluer peak of polarization ( @xmath2 ) suggested that the dust grains toward the v404  cygni region are generally smaller than the galactic average .",
