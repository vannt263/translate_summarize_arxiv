    "the theory of oscillations of rotating fluids of variable density [ rayleigh- taylor ( r - t ) effect ] was developed in detail by chandrasekhar ( 1961 ) , hereafter c61 .",
    "a large variety of the magnitohydrodynamic ( mhd ) problems , including the stability of inviscid and viscous fluids in the case of two uniform layers separated by a horizontal boundary with and without rotation as well as the magnetic field effects were analyzed using perturbation technique .",
    "the simplest case of a one - dimensional gravitational force was studied .",
    "a similar analysis was also implemented for the case of an exponentially varying density .",
    "it follows from c61 that the quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpo ) with the twin `` kilohertz '' frequencies represent the main frequencies of the stable gravity waves in the rotational frame of reference .",
    "it also as follows from c61 that the twin `` kilohertz '' frequencies should be on the order of the keplerian frequency .    in this",
    "_ paper _ i present the results of the study of the r - t effect for a particular case of fluid oscillations in an accretion flow under influence of a central gravitational force .",
    "this particular r - t analysis is important in view of the high and low frequency detection by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) in a number of low mass x - ray binaries ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 , van der klis et al .",
    "1996 ) , black hole candidate sources ( morgan , remillard & greiner 1997 ; strohmayer 2001a , b ; remillard 2002 ) and by extreme ultraviolet explorer , chandra x - ray observatory and optical observations in white dwarfs ( mauche 2002 and woudt & warner 2002 ) .",
    "the presence of two observed peaks with frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the upper part of the power spectrum became a natural starting point in modeling the phenomena . in ns binaries , for example sco x-1 , the lower frequency part of the power spectrum , contains two horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ) frequencies @xmath2 hz and @xmath3 hz ( probably the second harmonic of @xmath4 ) which slowly increase with the increase of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( van der klis et al .",
    "_ any plausible model faces the challenging task of describing the dependences of the peak separation @xmath5 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 _ .",
    "attempts have been made to relate @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the peak separation @xmath6 with the neutron star ( ns ) spin . in the sonic point",
    "beat frequency model by miller , lamb & psaltis ( 1998 ) the khz peak separation @xmath7 is considered to be close to the ns spin frequency and thus @xmath7 is predicted to be constant .",
    "however observations of khz qpos in a number of binaries ( sco x-1 , 4u 1728 - 34 , 4u 1608 - 52 , 4u 1702 - 429 and etc ) show that the peak separation decreases systematically when the high [ kilohertz ( khz ) ] frequencies increase ( for a recent review see van der klis 2000 , hereafter vdk ) . for sco x-1 vdk",
    "found that the peak separation of khz qpo frequencies changes from 320 hz to 220 hz when the lower khz peak @xmath0 changes from 500 hz to 850 hz .",
    "the correlation between high frequency ( lower khz frequency ) and low frequency ( broad noise component ) qpos previously found by psaltis , belloni & van der klis ( 1999 ) for black hole ( bh ) and neutron star ( ns ) systems has been recently extended over two orders of magnitude by mauche ( 2002 ) to white dwarf ( wd ) binaries . _ accepting the reasonable assumption that the same mechanism produces the qpo in wd , ns and bh binaries , one can argue that the data exclude relativistic models and , beat frequency models as well as any model requiring either the presence or absence of a stellar surface or a strong magnetic field . _    the transition layer model ( tlm )",
    "was introduced by titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 ) , hereafter tlm98 , to explain the dynamical adjustment of a keplerian disk to the innermost sub - keplerian boundary conditions ( it is at the star surface for nss and wds ) .",
    "tlm98 argued that a shock should occur where the keplerian disk adjusts to the sub - keplerian flow .",
    "thus the transition layer bounded between the sub - keplerian boundary and the adjustment radius can undergo various type of oscillations under the influence of the gas , radiation , magnetic pressure and gravitational force .",
    "osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) , hereafter ot99 , suggested that the phenomological model of a one - dimensional classical oscillator in the rotational frame of reference could explain the observed correlations between twin khz frequencies @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the hbo frequencies .",
    "they further suggested that the oscillations of the fluid element that bounced from the disk shock region ( at the adjustment radius ) would be seen as two independent oscillations parallel and perpendicular to the disk plane respectively .",
    "this is due to the presence of a coriolis force in the magnetospheric rotational frame of reference . in this paper",
    "i show that when the pressure gradients can be neglected , the problem of the rayleigh - taylor wave oscillations ( buoynancy effect ) in the rotational frame of reference is reduced to the ot99 formulation ( see  3 ) .",
    "this result provides a solid basis for application of the ot99 model for interpretation of the qpo phenomena observed in x - ray binaries .    the main goal of this _ paper _ is to demonstrate that there is an inevitable effect of the gravity wave oscillations in the heterogeneous fluid of the accretion flow near compact objects . in ",
    "2 , i formulate the problem of the gravity wave propagation in the bounded medium in the rotational frame of reference . in",

    "lord rayleigh ( 1883 ) has treated the non - rotating inviscid case of the present problem .",
    "he developed a general theory for any density configuration @xmath8 ( the z axis being the upward drawn vertical ) .",
    "rayleigh s treatment of inviscid superposed fluids was extended by bjerkness et al .",
    "( 1933 ) to include the influence of rotation . with an assumption of the gravitational force directed vertically , hide ( 1956 ) developed the theory for any density @xmath8 and viscosity @xmath9 profiles and any @xmath10 ( where @xmath10 is an angle between the rotational axis and the vertical ) . in this study",
    "we consider a case of an inviscid and incompressible fluid .",
    "the equation of relative motion appropriate to the problem is @xmath11 where the fluid is supposed to rotate uniformly about an axis whose direction is specified by the unit vector @xmath12 .",
    "the tensor notation follows the summation convention and the unit vector @xmath13 in the radial direction is introduced . in equation",
    "( 1 ) @xmath14 denotes the density , @xmath15 the angular velocity of rotation , @xmath16 the @xmath17th component of the ( eulerian ) velocity vector , p is the pressure and @xmath18 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "this term @xmath18 can represent the effective gravity which includes the centrifugal and radiation pressure forces .",
    "for an incompressible fluid the continuity equation is @xmath19 because ( similar to c61)diffusion effects are ignored in this analysis , an individual fluid element retains the same density throughout its motion .",
    "hence it is required that @xmath20 because the equilibrium situation in the comoving frame is a static one it is characterized by @xmath21 .",
    "we now assume the equilibrium situation to be slightly disturbed , so that @xmath22 so we shall write @xmath23 and treat @xmath16 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 as quantities of the first order of smallness so that products of such quantities can be ignored .",
    "we are interested in the study of the gravity wave oscillations in the disk transition layer where the accretion flow is sub - keplerian and the temperature of the flow is of order 5 kev or more ( see cartoon diagram of the system in titarchuk , osherovich & kuznetsov 1999 , hereafter tok , fig .",
    "1 ) . these temperatures of order of 5 kev are a representative values for plasma temperatures inferred from x - ray spectra during khz qpo events ( see more in titarchuk , bradshaw & wood 2001 and titarchuk & wood 2002 ) .    at this stage we introduce the cartesian coordinate system . we take the @xmath26 axis to be in the direction of the ( upward ) vertical and the @xmath27 axis to be such that the @xmath28 plane contains the angular velocity vector @xmath29 which then has components @xmath30 . in the general case",

    "in order to illustrate the buoyancy ( r - t ) effect we consider the simplest solutions of the problem including those which already exist in the literature .    _ case a _    in the case",
    "when we allow the vector @xmath29 to rotate around the @xmath26 axis at angle @xmath10 , we introduce the cylindrical coordinate system , namely taking the @xmath26 axis in the direction of the ( upward ) vertical , the @xmath27 axis as the radial axis and the @xmath36 axis as the azimuthal axis in the horizontal plane",

    "furthermore if we neglect the effects of pressure gradients , the set of equations ( 5 - 7 ) can be reduced to the system where the right hand side consists of only the vector @xmath49 .",

    "it is worth noting that the relation between @xmath70 , @xmath15 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 predicts the existence of the invariant quantity @xmath10 .",

    "he studied two cases : ( 1 ) in the case of two uniform fluids separated by a horizontal boundary he showed that for two adjacent , hydrostatic , inviscid fluids , the low fluid having density @xmath82 and the upper layer having density @xmath83 the eigenfrequency @xmath84 was @xmath85^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the frequency in the absence of rotation .",

    "this can happen during a burst event , when the gravitational forces are compensated by the radiation pressure forces ( e.g. titarchuk 1994 ) .",

    "in fact , this result also follows from treatments detailed in c61 and ot99 .",
    "the hybrid frequency then becomes simply @xmath174 for @xmath175 .",
    "this case of the perfect coherent oscillations would also occur if the density profile is quasi - uniform i.e. when @xmath176 but @xmath177 .",
    "these two conditions ( on either the effective gravity force or the density profile ) can be realized during the burst event .    in this section",
    "the main goal is to reveal all cases when stable gravity modes exist and when the stability breaks down .",
    "this analysis is particularly important in a view of the transient nature of qpo features ( see e.g. zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) . with an increase of bolometric luminosity ( presumably in mass accretion rate ) the khz qpo frequency increases and",
    "then entirely disappears ! at low rates it appears once again !",
    "the stability analysis presented here leads to conditions for the existence and the destruction of gravity modes in terms of density profiles scale heights @xmath178 and boundary conditions ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "in fact , the strong dependence of the gravity wave stability on the density profile was a central point of chandrasekhar s analysis ( c61 ) . for the accretion disk cases",
    ", we can give an example where stable gravity modes are followed by instabilities ( the gravity mode destruction ) . in case",
    "( ib ) we have a stable mode with @xmath180 as a qpo frequency .",
    "when the density profile changes , over @xmath181coordinate from @xmath182 to @xmath183 then the stable g - mode with @xmath180 can still be sustaned [ see case ( ia ) ] , but if the density profile over z coordinate is stabilized ( @xmath164 ) and that over r coordinate is inverted ( i.e. from @xmath184 to @xmath183 ) then the qpo oscillations are no longer stable .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , there are two stable oscillatory gravity modes : one is associated with the hybrid frequency @xmath180 ( see cases @xmath185 ) and another with the low branch frequency @xmath186 ( cases @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) .",
    "we also estimate the decay rate for oscillations as @xmath189 and the qpo quality value @xmath190 . the presence and absence of these modes depend on the atmospheric structure ( scale height inverses @xmath93 and @xmath124 ) and on the imposed boundary conditions ( wave numbers @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to restore the related boundary conditions if one compares the observed qpo features with the calculated mode frequencies and q - values .",
    "the analysis made in section 3 is also necessary in order to control an accuracy of numerical calculations of the set of hydrodynamical equations ( 5 - 9 ) .",
    "to illustrate the results obtained in  3 we should specify the orders of the introduced quantities @xmath191 .",
    "namely we assume that @xmath192 ( where @xmath193 ) and @xmath194 if we also assume that @xmath195 then @xmath196 . with these assumptions expressions for the polynomial coefficients @xmath197 ( see eq .",

    "the low frequencies in atoll sources ( as a rule ) are three times higher than those in the z - sources .",
    "the hectohertz frequencies have been identified in several other neutron star lmxbs ( 4u 0614 + 09 ; van straaten et al .",

    "the hectohertz frequency lorentzian profile are very broad with @xmath204-values around 1 or even less .",
    "we suggest that these observed frequencies can be identified as the low branch frequencies ( see formulas 28 - 29 ) . taking into account resonance effects ( t02 )",
    ", we correct the error bars of the hectohertz frequencies presented in s02 . in figure 2 the best fit to the data ( s02 ) is presented using formula ( 28 ) which includes one fit parameter q. the best - fit value of @xmath205 for which @xmath206 . the estimated @xmath207 are also in agreement with the observed values of @xmath204 ( s02 , table 2 ) .",
    "the harmonic modes @xmath208 can be related to a coherent oscillation frequency of 582 hz which is observed in 4u 1636 - 53 during the superburst ( strohmayer & markwardt 2002 ) . if @xmath209 ( which is our case ) @xmath210 is a double frequency of the ns spin frequency .",

    "_ thus the ns spin frequency @xmath213 hz and the double ns spin frequency @xmath214 hz have probably been detected in 4u 1636 - 53 .",
    "_    it is also worth noting that the rxte observations of neutron binaries establish that the khz qpo frequencies do not seem to exceed beyond a certain upper limit ( zhang et al .",
    "this observational effect may be a result of the density profile .",

    "i have presented a detailed study of the rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instability in the accretion flow . to summarize i have : ( 1 ) put forth arguments to explain the qpo phenomena , as a result of the r - t effect in the rotational frame of reference .",
    "( 2 ) formulated and solved the mathematical problem of the gravity wave propagation ( r - t effect ) in the accretion flow . ( 3 ) concluded that the stable gravity modes in the rotational frame of reference are related to the hybrid and low branch frequencies .",
    "( 4 ) demonstrated that the particular problem of the gravity waves in the rotational frame of reference , in the approximation of very small pressure gradients , is reduced to the problem of the classical oscillator in the rotational frame of reference which was previously introduced and applied for the interpretation of khz qpo observation by ot99 .",
    "i demonstrate that these frequencies are intrinsic features of the r - t effect .",
    "they appear in various configurations of the accretion flow depending on assumptions regarding the density profiles , the boundary conditions and the effects of the pressure forces .",
    "it is not by chance the high and low frequencies phenomenon has common observational appearances for a wide range of objects classes from black hole sources down to white dwarfs ( mauche 2002 ) .",
    "( 5 ) investigated the conditions for the density profile and the wave numbers ( boundary conditions ) when the gravity modes are stable .",
    "( 6 ) identified the observed qpo frequencies seen in the power density spectra of ns lmxbs using the inferred gravity mode frequencies .",
    "in particular , i found that the inferred low branch frequencies and their q - values are consistent with the qpo hectohertz frequencies observed in the atoll sources 4u 1728 - 34 and 4u 0614 + 19 .",
    "( 7 ) during the ns long ( super ) burst event , i find that the observer should see oscillations at double ns spin frequency .",
    "the coriolis force is the only force which acts in the rotational frame of references and its presence causes perfect coherent pulsations with a frequency twice of the ns spin frequency .",
    "finally one can conclude that the r - t gravity wave oscullations must be present and the related qpos should be detected in any system where the gravity , buoynancy and coriolis force effects can not be excluded ( even in the earth and solar environments ) .",

    "<S> such an effect of heterogeneity in presence of gravitational forces and pressure gradients exhibits raylegh - taylor gravity waves ( rtgw ) . </S>",
    "<S> they should be seen as quasioperiodic wave oscillations ( qpo ) of the accretion flow in the transition ( boundary ) layer between the keplerian disk and the central object . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i show that the main qpo frequency , which is very close to the keplerian frequency , is split into separate frequencies ( hybrid and low branch ) under the influence of the gravitational forces in the rotational frame of reference </S>",
    "<S> . the rtgws must be present and the related qpos should be detected in any system where the gravity , buoynancy and coriolis force effects can not be excluded ( even in the earth and solar environments ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed low and high qpo frequencies are an intrinsic signature of the rtgw . </S>",
    "<S> i elaborate the conditions for the density profile when the rtgw oscillations are stable . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the inferred qpo frequencies with qpo observations is presented . </S>",
    "<S> i find that hectohertz frequencies detected from ns binaries can be identified as the rtgw low branch frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> i also predict that an observer can see the double ns spin frequency during the ns long ( super ) burst events when the pressure gradients and buoyant forces are suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the coriolis force is the only force which acts in the rotational frame of reference and its presence causes perfect coherent pulsations with a frequency twice of the ns spin . </S>",
    "<S> the qpo observations of neutron binaries have established that the high qpo frequencies do not go beyond of the certain upper limit . </S>",
    "<S> i explain this observational effect as a result of the density profile inversions . </S>",
    "<S> also i demonstrate that a particular problem of the gravity waves in the rotational frame of reference in the approximation of very small pressure gradients is reduced to the problem of the classical oscillator in the rotational frame of reference which was previously introduced and applied for the interpretation of khz qpo observation by osherovich & titarchuk . </S>"
