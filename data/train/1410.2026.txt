    "solitons and solitary waves in crystals and their surfaces have been attained by nanosecond and picosecond laser ultrasonics methods .",
    "however , solitons in fluids have been studied less extensively : in fact , pertinent studies include seminal work by sugimoto and co - workers , who studied theoretically @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite propagation of one - dimensional ( 1d ) acoustic solitary waves in an air - filled waveguide , with a periodic array of helmholtz resonators . in these works",
    ", the analysis was based on nonlinear wave equations with fractional derivative terms accounting for losses . for this model , soliton solutions were found in an implicit form , and turned out to be close to korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) solitons in some asymptotic limit ; additionally , numerical studies on the model proposed in refs .  @xcite were recently reported too @xcite .",
    "other relevant works include refs .",
    "@xcite , where diffusive soliton solutions to the so - called kuznetsov equation ( which models weakly nonlinear acoustic wave propagation in viscoelastic media ) were studied .",
    "note that traveling wave solutions of a higher - order nonlinear acoustic wave equation of the kuznetsov - type ( valid for larger values of acoustic mach number ) were rigorously studied as well @xcite .",

    "we present experimental observations of acoustic solitons in this setting , and propose an analytically tractable modeling , relying on an effective nonlinear transmission line ( tl ) description of the system .",

    "this approach also allows for the study of nonlinear effects , and particularly soliton formation and propagation , a theme that has been studied extensively in the past in the context of electrical tls @xcite , and more recently in the realm of tl metamaterials @xcite .    in our setting , namely the @xmath0d lattice of helmholtz resonators ,",
    "the proposed tl model correctly reproduces  in the linear limit  the dispersion relation .",
    "furthermore , in the nonlinear regime , and in the small - amplitude , long - wavelentgth limit , the tl model describes  in a good agreement with the experiment  the soliton propagation in the waveguide .",
    "this simplified model also allows for an analytical study of the solitary waves based on universal nonlinear evolution equations that are derived by means of asymptotic expansions ( see below ) .",
    "a direct numerical integration of the model provides numerical results that are consistent with the analytics and the experimental observations .",
    "additionally , in the framework of the tl model , it is also possible to predict the formation of envelope solitons ( both of the bright and the dark type ) .",
    "we now proceed with a more specific description of our analysis and findings .",
    "first we note that our analysis relies on the study of an electrical tl , as per the electro - acoustic analogy , where the voltage corresponds to the acoustic pressure , and the current to the volume velocity flowing through the waveguide s cross - sectional area @xcite .",
    "nonlinear effects are taken into regard by incorporating nonlinear elements in the unit - cell circuit , accounting for the dependence of wave celerity on the pressure ( note that helmholtz resonators are assumed to have a linear response , while nonlinearity originates only for the large - amplitude wave propagation within the waveguide ) .",
    "this representation allows for the derivation of a nonlinear lattice model , which is studied numerically and analytically . in the numerical simulations , using initial conditions relevant to our experiments , we are able to reproduce soliton profiles and characteristics ( speed , width , etc ) in a good agreement with the experimental observations . furthermore , employing the continuum approximation , we study analytically the lattice model , and show that it is intimately related ( in proper temporal and spatial scales ) to models that have been studied in the past in other branches of physics : these include a boussinesq - type model and a kdv equation ( originally used to describe shallow water waves @xcite , waves in plasmas @xcite , solitons in electrical tls @xcite , etc ) , as well as a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation ( describing deep water waves @xcite , optical solitons @xcite , dynamics of bec @xcite , etc ) . this way , we derive approximate pulse - like solitons of the boussinesq and kdv type , as well as bright and dark envelope solitons satisfying an effective nls equation . in all cases , we identify parameter regimes where different types of solitons can be formed , and present numerical results that are found to be in an excellent agreement with the analytical predictions .    the paper is structured as follows . in section  ii , we describe the experimental setup and present experimental results for the formation of acoustic solitons in the @xmath0d lattice of helmholtz resonators .",
