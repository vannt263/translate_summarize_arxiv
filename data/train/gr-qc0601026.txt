    "the linear momentum emitted implies a recoil of , or kick to , the product of the merger .",
    "a large enough recoil may cause the resulting from the merger to be strongly offset from the center of the galaxy or potentially even kicked out of small galaxies  @xcite . such a scenario would have a significant impact on the standard picture of merger tree history of galaxies",
