    "one of the most interesting predictions of string theory , which is a strong candidate of the unified theory , is that our world is a higher dimensional space - time .",
    "since we feel we live in the four - dimensional space - time in low energy physical phenomena , extra - dimensions should be effectively compactified .",
    "it is natural to consider that the space - time is locally a direct product of our four - dimensional space - time and extra - dimensions .",
    "however , there are many possibilities how four - dimensional space - time and extra - dimensions are connected globally .",
    "the structure of the whole higher - dimensional space - time is not known .",
    "can we get any information of the global structure of the whole higher - dimensional space - time from any experiment localized in a finite region ? to approach this question , at the first step , we consider a system of black holes with a non - trivial asymptotic structure as a toy model and we compare the coalescing process with a trivial asymptotic structure case .    in the series of works  @xcite",
    ", it is presented that differences of black hole coalescence processes caused by asymptotic structure . in the case of the five - dimensional space - time in which the boundary of the spatial infinity is not @xmath0 but lens space",
    ", it is possible that two black holes with the topology of @xmath0 coalesce and change into a single black hole with the topology of the lens space , i.e. , @xmath6 . analyzing the horizons at early time and late time , we found that the areas of the horizon after coalescence in such cases is larger than the ordinary cases in five dimension , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "however , the shape of the event horizon is not clear in an intermediate period . in this paper",
    ", we discuss details of event horizon structures in coalescing black holes with non - trivial asymptotic structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly review the coalescing black holes with trivial and non - trivial asymptotic structures in five dimensions .",
    "section iii we investigate the structures of the event horizon of coalescing black holes numerically and discuss coalescing process in typical time slices .",
    "section iv is devoted to the discussion of the structure of the crease set of the event horizon . finally , in section v we discuss the obtained results .",
    "black hole coalescence is one of the most interesting issues in a study of gravity . to treat the coalescencing process",
    ", we need heavy numerical work in general .",
    "however , if the mass and the electric charge of each black hole are equal , we can construct exact solutions which describe the coalescencing processes driven by a positive cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "one of such solutions in five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with a positive cosmological constant is the kastor - traschen solution(5dkt )  @xcite .",

    "this solution describes the physical process such that two black holes with the topology of @xmath12 coalesce into a single black hole with the topology of @xmath13 .",
    "recently , coalescing black hole solution on eguchi - hanson space(cbeh )  @xcite has been found as another exact solution in the same theory .",

    "this solution describes the physical process such that two black holes with the topology of @xmath0 coalesce into a single black hole with the topology of the lens space @xmath17 due to the non - trivial asymptotic structure  @xcite . to confirm this ,",
    "let us see the behavior of the metric at early time @xmath18 and at late time @xmath19 , following the discussion in  @xcite . at early time @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the metric behaves as @xmath22 , \\label{earlymet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced a new radial coordinate , @xmath23 and a new mass parameter , @xmath24 .",
    "this metric is the same form as that of five - dimensional reissner - nordstrm - de sitter solution with mass parameter @xmath25 written in the cosmological coordinate .",
    "therefore , we can see that there are two black holes with the topology of @xmath0 at early time . on the other hand , at late time @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the metric behaves as @xmath28 , \\label{latemet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the new radial coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "this resembles the metric of the five - dimensional reissner - nordstrm - de sitter solution with mass equal to @xmath30 but the topology of horizon is the lens space @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we can see the solution ( [ eq : eh ] ) describes the process such that two black holes with @xmath0 at early time coalesce into a single black hole with the lens space @xmath17 at late time .",
    "however , since here , we only investigate the asymptotic behaviors of the metric at early time and at late time , it is not clarified how two black holes with @xmath0 coalesce into a single black hole with the lens space @xmath17 .",
    "so , in the following sections , we numerically investigate the location and the shape of the event horizon for the solution ( [ eq : eh])-([eq : eh8 ] ) and make clear the process of the coalescence .",
    ") ]                 ) ]                 an event horizon is defined as the boundary of the causal past of the future null infinity . due to the absence of killing horizons in a dynamical spacetime , it is difficult to determine the location of an event horizon analytically .",
    "we can investigate the location of the event horizon by integrating numerically null geodesic equations backward from sufficiently future to the past@xcite .",
    "since both metrics eqs.([5dktmet ] ) and ( [ eq : eh ] ) asymptote to the metric of reissner - nordstrm - de sitter solution in the limit of @xmath26 , fortunately we can know where the event horizons locate at late time .",
    "so if we solve null geodesic equations numerically from each point of the spatial cross section of the event horizons at late time backward the past where we set the initial null direction to be tangent to the event horizon at late time , we can get null geodesic generators of the event horizons , namely we can find the locations of the event horizons .      in 5dkt case , we obtain null geodesic generators of the event horizon for the metric ( [ 5dktmet ] ) .",
    "we can set @xmath31 without loss of generality because of the @xmath32 symmetry in @xmath33 space .",
    "then , we solve null geodesics in the effective three - dimensional metric given by @xmath34 , \\\\ h & = & 1+\\frac{1}{e^{-\\lambda t } } \\left(\\frac{m_1}{x^2+(w- a)^2 } + \\frac{m_2}{x^2+(w+ a)^2}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after some numerical calculations , we get the data of coordinate values of location of event horizon , and we plot the coordinate values @xmath35 in fig.[fig:5dkt ] . in this graph , each contour line means cross section of horizon with a @xmath36 . surface . in fig.[fig:5dkttimeslice ] , we plot the the coordinate values @xmath37 of event horizon at some typical time slices . from fig.[fig:5dkttimeslice ] we can see that two black holes collide at @xmath38 and the first contact point is given by @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath40-axis is fixed points @xmath32 symmetry in @xmath33 space , the topology of this first contact point in fig.[fig:5dkttimeslice ] is a point in the whole five - dimensional space - time .      in cbeh case , we obtain null geodesic generators of the event horizon for the metric ( [ eq : eh ] ) .",
    "we can set @xmath41 without loss of generality because of the @xmath42 symmetry in @xmath43 space .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath44 is a killing vector , we can set @xmath45 .",
    "then , we solve null geodesics in the effective three - dimensional metric given by @xmath46 similar to the above discussion , we plot the coordinate values of event horizon @xmath47 in fig.[fig : eh ] . in fig.[fig : ehtimeslice ] , we plot the the coordinate values @xmath48 of event horizon at some typical time slices . from fig.[fig : ehtimeslice ] , we can see that two black holes collide at @xmath49 and the first contact point is given by @xmath50 . in this case",
    ", @xmath51-axis is fixed points of @xmath42 symmetry in @xmath43 space , but @xmath52 is not a fixed point of the @xmath53 isometry generated by @xmath44 .",
    "so the topology of this first contact point in fig.[fig : ehtimeslice ] is not a point but @xmath4 in the whole five - dimensional space - time since the integral curve of @xmath44 is @xmath4 .",
    "this is the specific difference from 5dkt .",
    "the intermediate time evolutions of the spatial cross section of black hole coalescence depends on the choice of time slices in general .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , how black holes coalesce is determined invariantly by the structure of the crease set of an event horizon and the spatial horizon topology far in the future , where the crease set is a set of past end points of null geodesic generators of an event horizon and the event horizon can not be smooth there .    in 5dkt ,",
    "the crease set is given by the form of @xmath54 .",
    "hence we immediately find that the topology of the crease set is @xmath2 . on the other hand , in cbeh",
    ", the crease set is given by the form of @xmath55 , which indicates @xmath56 in the space - time , where @xmath4 is generated by @xmath44 .",
    "clearly , the dimension of crease sets in 5dtk and cbeh are different . for this reason , choosing the @xmath57=constant slice before the coalescence occur and focusing on one black hole , the spatial sections of the event horizons can be schematically drawn as in figs.[fig : pointcs ] , [ fig : s1cs ] , respectively .         which correspond to a great circle of @xmath0 .",
    "]     are depicted .",
    "we assume time slices ( i ) and ( ii ) respect @xmath32 symmetry for 5dkt and @xmath58 symmetry for cbeh . ]    to see the explicit difference between intermediate evolutions , we consider another time slice ( i ) shown in fig.[fig : timeslice ] for the both 5dkt and cbeh cases . for simplicity , we assume the spatial symmetry is the same as @xmath59const . surface .",
    "the central part of the intersection of the slice ( i ) and the event horizon makes a three - dimensional closed surface in the both cases .    in the case of 5dkt , because the points @xmath60 and @xmath61 in fig.[fig : timeslice ] are fixed points of the so(3 ) rotation in @xmath33 space , the middle closed surface in fig.[fig : timeslice ] is topologically @xmath0 , i.e. , the middle region is a black hole with @xmath0 horizon . for more general time slices",
    ", a number of black holes with @xmath0 horizons can appear in the 5dkt case as the time slice ( ii ) shown in fig.[fig : timeslice ] .",
    "in contrast , in the case of cbeh , because the points @xmath60 and @xmath61 in fig.[fig : timeslice ] are fixed points of the @xmath42 rotation but not fixed points of the @xmath53 generated by @xmath44 , the intersection of the slice ( i ) and the event horizon is topologically @xmath5",
    ". then a black ring @xmath5 is formed in the time slice ( i ) during coalescence of two black holes in the cbeh case .",
    "this is due to the differences of the structure of the crease set .",
    "in this paper , we have studied how the structures of the event horizons of five - dimensional coalescing black holes differ in association with the asymptotic structure .",
    "we especially focus on the two solutions , i.e. kastor - traschen solution(5dkt ) @xcite in which two black holes with @xmath0 topology coalesce into a single black hole with @xmath0 topology and coalescing black hole solution on eguchi - hanson space(cbeh)@xcite in which two black holes with @xmath0 topology coalesce into a single black hole with the lens space @xmath17 topology .",
    "it came out that , if we choose the time slices in which the symmetry of the base space is respected , the first contact points of the coalescing process compose @xmath4 in the cbeh case unlike the 5dkt case in which the first contact point is a point in the five dimensional spacetime .",
    "this is the specific difference in topology changing process @xmath0 into the lens space @xmath17 in the cbeh case .",
    "the fact the first contact point is @xmath4 in cbeh can be understood as follows .",
    "let us consider the coalescence of two spheres centered at each nut of the eguchi - hanson space which is the base space of cbeh instead of considering the coalescence of black holes .",
    "if the two spheres are chosen to be symmetric the coalescence would occur at the midpoint between the two nuts .",
    "the topology of the midpoint between the two nuts is @xmath4 which corresponds to equator of @xmath62-bolt of the eguchi - hanson space in which two nuts are on the north and the south pole respectively .",
    "we have also investigated the structure of crease sets of the event horizons .",
    "we have shown that the topologies of crease sets are @xmath2 for 5dkt and @xmath56 for cbeh .",
    "since the dimensions of the crease sets are different from each other , it is expected that we can see the difference of intermediate evolutions explicitly if we adopt a different timeslice .",
    "in fact , we can find the time slice in which black ring @xmath5 is formed in a certain period in the case of cbeh unlike the 5dkt .",
