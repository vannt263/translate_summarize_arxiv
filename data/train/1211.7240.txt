    "<S> if the second pulse were omitted completely , there would still be the retrieval of rightward propagating light , well known from experiments on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite . the photon number retrieved in this beam , however , </S>",
    "<S> does depend on whether fwm occurred because there is competition between the processes retrieving light propagating downward and rightward .    when considering the perspectives for scaling this gate down to the single - photon level in order to obtain a quantum logic gate , it is crucial whether the gate operation is phase coherent . </S>",
    "<S> we will now show experimentally that this is the case for the gate demonstrated here .    from a theoretical point of view @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> raman amw is analogous to a usual stimulated raman process , except that the emission is bosonically stimulated not by application of a second laser beam but by the presence of a second bec . </S>",

    "<S> , the atoms are transferred into the initially empty state in a phase coherent way , with the relative phase of the two applied laser beams determining the phase of the transferred atomic amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we expect that raman amw generates light in a phase coherent way , with the relative phase of the two becs determining the phase of the emitted light .    to test experimentally whether the emitted light is phase coherent , we shorten the second raman pulse to @xmath53 @xmath28s at correspondingly higher light intensities . </S>",
    "<S> interaction - time broadening now makes the doppler shift for the transfer of population into state @xmath30 irrelevant . </S>",

    "<S> * the retrieved photon number propagating downward exhibits a sinusoidal oscillation as a function of the fwm time . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit value for the oscillation frequency is 15.4 khz . </S>",

    "<S> the retrieved photon number propagating downward is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - oscillation ] as a function of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly shows a sinusoidal oscillation . to understand the physical origin of this oscillation </S>",
    "<S> , we note that during @xmath39 , the atomic components that contribute to the first pathway , @xmath55 , differ in kinetic energy by @xmath56 , whereas the components of the second pathway , @xmath57 , differ by @xmath58 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 denotes the atomic mass . during @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> these pairs of becs thus accumulate different relative phases . upon retrieval </S>",
    "<S> , these relative phases of the pairs of becs are mapped onto the phases of the retrieved signal light , as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the amplitudes associated with the two pathways create an interference signal on the detector . </S>",
    "<S> an independent measurement of our beam geometry yields @xmath60 and @xmath61 . with @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> nm we expect an angular frequency @xmath63 khz for the oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> if the beams pointed exactly along the coordinate axes , then we would expect @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the recoil energy of the signal light .    </S>",
    "<S> two effects contribute to the observed envelope of the oscillation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , raman amw requires spatial overlap of the atomic momentum components . for long times , </S>",
    "<S> such overlap is lost and no directed retrieval is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the timescale seen for this effect in fig .  [ fig - oscillation ] is similar to the timescale of saturation in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - absorption ] , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> second , retrieval of downward propagating light requires fwm to occur , so that an increase at short times , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - absorption ] , is also seen in the envelope in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - oscillation ] .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we fit a sinusoid with a gaussian envelope and a constant visibility @xmath66 to the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - oscillation ] . </S>",
    "<S> this yields best - fit values of @xmath67 khz and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath66 is not perfect is theoretically expected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the above expectation for @xmath69 is excellent . </S>",
    "<S> this oscillation is not seen in time - of - flight absorption images , either in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - absorption ] or in similar data that we took for the extended scheme ( not shown here ) . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the retrieval of the light is necessary to make the oscillation appear .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed oscillation proves that the complete gate operation is phase coherent . </S>",
    "<S> this includes all physical processes involved in the gate , namely raman pulses 1 and 2 , atomic fwm , and light emission during raman amw . </S>",
    "<S> the observed phase coherence is a crucial ingredient for a possible extension to a photon - photon quantum logic gate .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that an extension of our scheme to the single - photon level is challenging . </S>",
    "<S> one possible problem is that smaller photon numbers slow down the atomic fwm so that the spatial overlap of the matter waves might end before achieving enough population transfer . </S>",
    "<S> another possible problem is that the bosonic stimulation caused by a single atom in driving either atomic fwm or raman amw is weak so that competing processes might cause problems , e.g. , isotropic @xmath0-wave scattering or spontaneous photon emission . </S>",
    "<S> working out strategies to solve these problems is beyond the scope of the present paper .    on a more general level </S>",
    "<S> , our experiment demonstrates that storage and retrieval of light combined with the nonlinearity of the gp equation can be used to create a phase - coherent gate for two classical light pulses . </S>",
    "<S> if the geometry were altered to make all laser beams copropagating , then the nonlinearity of the gp equation would generate a conditional phase shift instead of atomic fwm . </S>",
    "<S> a recent theoretical analysis of the single - photon version of that scheme resulted in a detailed proposal for a photon - photon quantum - logic gate @xcite .    </S>",
