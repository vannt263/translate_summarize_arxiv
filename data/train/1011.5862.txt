    "let us mention here the ( few ) known results on distinguishing nielsen equivalence of generating @xmath12-tuples for infinite groups .",
    "apart from the special and much easier case of @xmath51 , these can be mostly separated into two distinct approaches .",
    "the first one is algebraic ( @xmath76-theoretic ) .",
    "the earliest work is due to noskov @xcite who showed that there exist non - minimal generating tuples that are not nielsen equivalent to a tuple containing the trivial element and thereby giving a negative answer to a question of waldhausen .",
    "these results where later generalized by evans @xcite .    lustig and moriah @xcite , @xcite",
    ", @xcite used algebraic methods to distinguish nielsen equivalence classes of fuchsian groups and other groups with appropriate presentations .",
    "this enabled them to distinguish isotopy classes of vertical heegaard splittings of seifert manifolds .",
    "recently evans @xcite , for any given number @xmath77 , produced large generating tuples of metabelian groups that do not become nielsen equivalent after adding the trivial element to the tuples @xmath77 times , making those the first examples of this type in the literature even for the case @xmath78 .",
    "the generating tuples however are much bigger than the rank of the group .",
    "the second approach is combinatorial - geometric and is closer in spirit to nielsen s original work , it relies mostly on using cancellation methods .",
    "first in line is grushko s theorem @xcite which states that any generating tuple of a free product is nielsen equivalent to a tuple of elements that lie in the union of the factors .",
    "together with recent work of the second author @xcite this implies that nielsen equivalence of irreducible generating tuples in a free product is decidable iff it is decidable in the factors .",
    "zieschang @xcite proves that any minimal generating tuple of a surface group is nielsen equivalent to the standard generating tuple and proves a similar result for fuchsian groups that lead to the solution of the rank problem @xcite .",
    "nielsen equivalence in fuchsian groups has been studied by many authors .",
    "recently louder @xcite has generalized zieschangs result to arbitrary generating tuples .",
    "the finiteness of nielsen equivalence classes of @xmath12-tuples for torsion - free locally quasiconvex - hyperbolic groups has been established by the authors @xcite generalizing a result of delzant @xcite who studied 2-generated groups .",
    "the first author and schupp @xcite have recently established uniqueness of the nielsen equivalence class of minimal generating tuples for a class of groups closely related to the one studied in the present article .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following theorem , which implies in particular that there exist 2-generated torsion - free word - hyperbolic groups that have generating pairs @xmath79 and @xmath80 such that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are not nielsen equivalent .",
    "see section  [ sect : gen ] for precise definitions and notations related to genericity .",
    "if @xmath83 are integers , for the free group @xmath84 we denote by @xmath85 the set of all @xmath86-tuples @xmath87 of cyclically reduced words in @xmath84 such that @xmath88 .",

    "[ main ] let @xmath83 be arbitrary and let @xmath0 be a group given by the presentation @xmath93    there exist generic subsets @xmath94 and @xmath95 such that for any @xmath96 and any @xmath97 with @xmath98 , the group @xmath0 given by presentation @xmath99 above has the following property :    for any @xmath100 the generating @xmath66-tuple @xmath10 of @xmath0 is not nielsen equivalent to a tuple @xmath101 .",
    "the theorem immediately implies that for the case @xmath102 the generating @xmath66-tuples @xmath103 and @xmath11 are not nielsen equivalent in @xmath0 .",
    "however , we do believe that much more is true , namely that following holds :    [ mainc ] let @xmath104 . there",

    "in particular , if @xmath102 , the conjecture would imply that at least @xmath12 stabilizations are needed in @xmath0 in order to make the generating @xmath12-tuples @xmath111 and @xmath112 nielsen equivalent .",

    "we put @xmath837 to be the word obtained from @xmath838 by free reduction , clearly it is not longer than @xmath791 .",
    "let now @xmath839 be the graph obtained from @xmath786 by performing the above mentioned changes .",
    "the construction clearly preserves the fact that the map from @xmath839 to @xmath806 is @xmath840-surjective .",
    "thus @xmath839 folds onto @xmath806 therefore onto @xmath268 as @xmath806 fords onto @xmath268 .",
    "in particular the loops of @xmath839 represent a tuples that is equivalent to @xmath841 such that the first two elements represent in @xmath0 the elements @xmath332 and @xmath749 .",
    "note however that the sum of the lengths of the first two petals has decreased as we first increased their lengths by at most @xmath788 and then decreased their lengths by at least @xmath813 .",
    "this yields a contradiction with the minimality assumption .",
    "recall that @xmath12 is the cardinality of the free basis @xmath255 of @xmath185 .",
    "if the length of @xmath196 is less than @xmath843 then there are only @xmath844 possibilities @xmath845 for the @xmath255-graph @xmath765 . by lemma  [ not - so - trivial ] for each @xmath846",
    "the set of words readable in @xmath847 is exponentially negligible in @xmath185 .",
    "since the union of finitely many exponentially negligible sets is again exponentially negligible , it follows that there exists an exponentially generic subset of @xmath185 ( independent on the choice of @xmath196 ) such that for every word @xmath137 from that subset no portion of @xmath137 that is more than @xmath848 of the length of @xmath137 can be read in @xmath716 .",
    "we can then get a contradiction similarly to the proof of theorem  [ specialcase ] .",
    "namely , by construction there exists a freely reduced word @xmath431 ( labelling one of the petals in the graph @xmath281 ) whose cyclically reduced form @xmath849 can be read in @xmath716 and such that the element represented by @xmath137 is conjugate to @xmath332 in @xmath0 .",
    "then by corollary  [ cor : conj - sc ] the word @xmath850 contains a significant portion of a defining relation from @xmath404 , contradicting the genericity assumptions on presentation ( ! ! ) .",
    "suppose now that the length of @xmath196 is at least @xmath843 .",
    "then , again arguing as in the proof of theorem  [ specialcase ] , we see that there exists a cyclically reduced word @xmath850 that can be read in @xmath716 such that @xmath849 represents an element conjugate to @xmath332 in @xmath0 .",
    "then , by corollary  [ cor : conj - sc ] , @xmath849 contains a subword @xmath851 such that @xmath851 is also a subword of one of the defining relations in ( ! ! ) constituting more than @xmath848 of that defining relation .",
    "thus , on one hand , the word @xmath851 is generic and , on the other hand , @xmath851 is equal , as a word , to a product of the form @xmath852 where the words @xmath394 are readable in @xmath348 . since words readable in @xmath348 are highly non - generic in @xmath185 ( because there exists a reduced word of length 2 in @xmath185 that can not be read in @xmath348 ) , we have @xmath853 for @xmath854 .",
    "this implies that a definite positive proportion of @xmath851 consists of the copies of @xmath855 , which again contradicts genericity of @xmath851 .",
