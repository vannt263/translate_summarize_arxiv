    "it may be noted that to compare the finite size effects , we normalise the parameters @xmath243 or @xmath140 by their ranges required for full magnetisation reversal .",
    "in fact , this weak finite size effect for high @xmath243 and @xmath10 regions did not lead to any reasonable value for the fitting exponent in the scaling analysis .    for the static transition of the pure two - dimensional ising system , @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "for low temperature ( and low @xmath6 ) regions of the magnetisation - reversal phase boundary , the observed values of @xmath228 ( in the range 0.42 - 0.46 ) are considerably lower than the above mentioned value for the static transition .",

    "such small value of the cumulant at the crossing point can hardly be imagined to be a finite - size effect ; it seems unlikely that one would get here also the same universality class and @xmath228 value will eventually shoot up to @xmath249 ( for larger system sizes ) , as for the other range of the transition . on the other hand , such low value of @xmath228 might indicate a very weak singularity , as indicated by the mean field calculations @xcite mentioned in the introduction .",
    "in fact , even for the static transition , as the dimensionality increases , and the singularity becomes weaker ( converging to mean field exponents ) with increasing lattice dimension , the cumulant crossing point @xmath228 decreases ( @xmath250 in @xmath170 to @xmath249 in @xmath251 ) .",
    "we believe the mean field transition behavior here , as mentioned earlier , is even weaker in this dynamic case as reflected by the value @xmath238 , corresponding to a logarithmic singularity ( as in eqns .",

    "in this paper , we review all the aspects studied so far on the dynamic magnetization - reversal phenomena in the ising model under a finite - duration external magnetic field competing with the existing order for @xmath0 .",
    "we have discussed the mean - field equation of motion and its solution , the nature of the mf phase boundary and the divergence of the susceptibility and relaxation time .",
    "the analytic solution of the linearized equation of motion also showed divergence of susceptibility and relaxation time on the mf phase boundary @xcite .",
    "the same transition has been studied by monte carlo simulations in both two and three dimensions .",
    "the obtained phase diagram is consistent with the classical nucleation theory .",
    "the nucleation process is initiated by the external magnetic field and depending on the strength of the field the system nucleates either through the growth of a single droplet or through the growth and subsequent coalescence of many droplets . for @xmath252",
    "the system belongs to the multi - droplet regime and the transition is continuous in nature ; whereas for @xmath253 the system goes over to the single - droplet regime where transition is discontinuous . expecting power law behaviour for both @xmath101 and @xmath195 in multi - droplet regime , the finite size scaling fits give the estimates of the critical exponents @xmath254 and @xmath255 for both @xmath170 and @xmath256 .",
    "unlike in the mf case , where the relaxation time @xmath257 shows a logarithmic divergence , @xmath258 in mc studies falls off exponentially away from @xmath30 and the divergence in @xmath180 comes through the growth of the prefactor @xmath182 with the system size .",
