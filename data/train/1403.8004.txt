    "the family of 1212 cuprates has single block layers and involves capable materials for superconducting wires because their anisotropy is less than that of the 2212 and 2223 families , which have double block layers bonded by van der waals forces .",
    "the crystal structure of pbsr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath5 ( pb1212 ) is very similar to that of tlba@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath14 ( tl1212 ) and hgba@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath15 ( hg1212 ) , both of which have a critical temperature @xmath16 greater than 100  k. pb1212 is expected to be less anisotropic than tl1212 and hg1212 because the ionic radius of the element account for the block layers is the smallest in the series ( @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 ) . among the pb1212 compounds , pb@xmath0bi@xmath1sr@xmath2y@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath2o@xmath5 ( pbbi1212)@xcite and pb@xmath0cu@xmath1sr@xmath2y@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath2o@xmath5 ( pbcu1212)@xcite are of specific importance for industry because they mainly consist of the ubiquitous elements pb and ca rather than the more exotic bi and y , which are currently used for high-@xmath16 superconducting wires .",
    "however , for pb1212 , the superconducting properties such as anisotropy and critical current are inadequately understood because of the difficulty of obtaining single - crystal samples of this material .",
    "this lack of reliable samples has even led to claims that pbbi1212 is nonsuperconducting and the reported superconductivity of pbbi1212 ( @xmath16 = 92  k@xcite ) is attributed to the secondary phase of bi@xmath22sr@xmath22cacu@xmath22o@xmath23 ( bi2212 ) .",
    "therefore , this study aims to verify the superconductivity of pbbi1212 by growing single - crystal pbbi1212 epitaxial films .",
    "growing thin films of cuprates that incorporate pb and bi is extremely challenging because their vapor pressure is very high to maintain the chemical composition of the film at the growth temperature of approximately 700  @xmath7c .",
    "karimoto and naito succeeded in growing an epitaxial film of pbsr@xmath2cuo@xmath24 by molecular beam epitaxy@xcite .",
    "however , they also reported that the method does not work well for the growth of pb1212 , because the growth temperature is limited due to the volatility of pb@xcite .",
    "although we attempted to grow pbbi1212 by conventional @xmath25 @xmath26 sputtering , we never obtained single - phase films of pbbi1212 because of the re - evaporation of pb and bi from the substrate .    in the present paper , we describe a two - step growth technique@xcite that allows us to maintain the chemical composition of the film : pbbi1212 deposited on a srtio@xmath6 ( sto ) substrate at low temperature forms an amorphous film which , at high temperature , crystallizes with the crystallographic symmetry of the substrate .",
    "we demonstrated that this technique works well for fabricating single - phase pbbi1212 epitaxial films .",
    "it is found that the pbbi1212 system exhibits superconductivity at approximately 50  k. we also clarify various superconducting properties of the pb1212 system such as substitution effects , coherence lengths , and anisotropy .",
    "the two - step growth technique may provide a method to fabricate next - generation superconducting wires from ubiquitous elements .",
    "pbbi1212 epitaxial film was grown by a two - step technique consisting of a low temperature sputtering step and a high temperature @xmath27 @xmath26 growth step .",
    "sputtering targets were synthesized by the solid - state reaction method using high purity powders ( @xmath20  99.9% ) of pbo , bi@xmath2o@xmath6 , srco@xmath6 , y@xmath2o@xmath6 , caco@xmath6 , and cuo .",

    "after calcination , the powders were pressed into cylindrical pellets 100  mm in diameter and 7  mm in height , and they were sintered at @xmath34  @xmath7c for 24  h in air , where @xmath8 is the ca concentration . for depositing the pbbi1212 amorphous films on sto ( 100 ) substrates",
    ", we used the following sputtering conditions : the sputtering gas pressure was 100  mtorr ( 60  sccm  ar and 15  sccm  o@xmath2 ) , the anode voltage was 1.4  kv , and the substrate temperature was approximately 200  @xmath7c ( the substrates were not heated ) .",
    "the deposition time was set to 1  2  h. the thickness of the pbbi1212 thin films measured by a stylus - based profilometer was 1800  3500   .",
    "pbbi1212 containers used for @xmath27 @xmath26 growth were made of polycrystalline pellets prepared in the same way as the sputtering targets at compositions of pb@xmath0bi@xmath1sr@xmath2y@xmath35ca@xmath36cu@xmath2o@xmath32 ( @xmath37  =  0    0.5 ) .",
    "the mixed powders were calcined three times at 880  @xmath7c for 10  h in air , pressed into two cylindrical pellets 26  mm in diameter and 5  mm in height , and sintered at 1007  @xmath7c for 3  h in air . for epitaxial growth ,",
    "amorphous films on sto substrates were placed in a pit ( 8  @xmath38  8  @xmath38  2  mm@xmath39 ) formed at the center of one of the sintered pellets as shown in fig .",
    "the other pellet was used as a lid for the growth container .",
    "the container containing the amorphous film was heated in a muffle furnace at 970  @xmath7c for 6  h under an o@xmath2 atmosphere and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 200  @xmath7c / h .",
    "the concentration of the films was determined by energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) , and it was found that the concentration of pb and bi drastically changes during the film growth .",
    "the concentration of pb and bi is dominated by the composition of the growth container , whereas the concentrations of the other elements in the films are dominated by the composition of the sputtering target .",
    "as - grown films are not superconducting and a subsequent quenching treatment is necessary to make them superconducting . in this treatment ,",
    "the film was placed in a quartz tube and heated at 815  @xmath7c in air for 1  h. within two seconds after removing the quartz tube from the furnace , it was placed in liquid nitrogen .",

    "1(c ) also shows the influence of lattice deformation from the bi substitution .",

    "3(b ) suggests that carrier doping is governed by the substitution of y@xmath75 for ca@xmath76 and 0.34 hole is introduced by the substitution of a ca@xmath76 ion .",
