    "the study of halo nuclei is one of the main subjects of research in nuclear physics at present .",
    "many theoretical predictions on halo , superhalo and antihalo nuclei have been advanced in recent years  @xcite .",
    "most of these calculations correspond to nuclei very far from the stability line .",
    "they are mainly thought as a guide for experiments to be performed in coming facilities .",
    "the general feature found in these calculations is that a necessary condition for a nucleus to develop a halo is that the outmost nucleons move in shells which extend far in space .",
    "that is , only a weak barrier keep the system within the nuclear volume .",
    "these shells may be resonances , antibound states ( also called virtual states ) , or even low - spin bound states which lie very close to the continuum threshold .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled by the nucleus @xmath5li and also heavier li isotopes .",
    "there are a number of experiments which have been performed in these very unstable isotopes in order to get information about the structure of halos  @xcite .",
    "in particular we will concentrate our attention to refs .",
    "@xcite where the spectrum of @xmath0li was measured .",
    "our aim is to analyze these experimental data by using a suitable formalism to treat unstable nuclei .",
    "this formalism is an extension of the shell model to the complex energy plane and is therefore called complex shell model  @xcite , although the name gamow shell model is also used  @xcite . in addition , the correlations induced by the pairing force acting upon particles moving in decaying single - particle states will be taken into account by using the multistep shell model ( msm )  @xcite .    the formalism is presented in section [ form ] .",
    "applications are in section [ appl ] and a summary and conclusions are in section  [ sumc ] .",
    "the study of unstable nuclei is a very difficult undertaking since , in principle , time dependent formalisms should be used to describe the motion of a decaying nucleus .",
    "however , the system may be considered stationary if it lives a long time . in this case",
    "the time dependence can be circumvented .",
    "in fact , often unstable nuclei live a very long time and therefore they may be considered bound as , e.g. , in alpha decaying states of many heavy isotopes , like @xmath6bi or @xmath7ta(9@xmath8 ) , with @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental facilities allow one nowadays to measure systems living a very short time . to describe these short time processes one has to consider the decaying character of the system .",
    "this is shown , e.g. , by the failure of the shell model calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , performed by using a standard bound representation , to explain even the ground state of @xmath0li @xcite .    of the various theories that have been conceived to analyze unbound systems",
    ", we will apply an extension of the shell model to the complex energy plane  @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of this theory is that resonances can be described in terms of states lying in the complex energy plane .",
    "the real parts of the corresponding energies are the positions of the resonances while the imaginary parts are minus twice the corresponding widths , as it was proposed by gamow at the beginning of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "these complex states correspond to solutions of the schrdinger equation with outgoing boundary conditions .",
    "we will not present here the formalism in detail , since this was done many times before , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite . rather , we will give the main points necessary for the presentation of the applications .",
    "in this subsection we will very briefly describe the representation to be used here .",
    "the eigenstates of a central potential obtained as outgoing solutions of the schrdinger equation can be used to express the dirac @xmath10-function as @xcite @xmath11 where the sum runs over all the bound and antibound states plus the complex states ( resonances ) which lie between the real energy axis and the integration contour @xmath12 .",
    "the wave function of a state @xmath13 in these discrete set is @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the scattering function at energy @xmath16 .",
    "the antibound states are virtual states with negative scattering length .",
    "they are fundamental to describe nuclei in the li region @xcite .    discretizing the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delb ] ) one obtains the set of orthonormal vectors @xmath17 forming the berggren representation @xcite .",
    "since this discretization provides an approximate value of the integral , the berggren vectors fulfill the relation @xmath18 , where all states , that is bound , antibound , resonances and discretized scattering states , are included .",
    "the corresponding single - particle wave functions are @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the spin wave function and @xmath21 is the radial wave function fulfilling the berggren metric , according to which the scalar product between two functions consists of one function times the other ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath22    using the berggren representation one readily gets the two - particle shell - model equations in the complex energy plane ( cxsm ) @xcite , i.e. , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the residual interaction .",
    "the tilde in the interaction matrix element denotes mirror states so that in the corresponding radial integral there is not any complex conjugate , as required by the berggren metric .",
    "the two - particle states are labeled by @xmath25 and latin letters label single - particle states .",
    "@xmath26 is the correlated two - particle energy and @xmath27 is single - particle energy .",
    "the two - particle wave function is given by @xmath28 where the two - particle creation operator is given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the angular momentum of the two - particle state .",
    "we will use a separable interaction as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which describes well the states of @xmath5li .",
    "the energies are thus obtained by solving the corresponding dispersion relation .",
    "the two - particle wave function amplitudes are given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the single particle matrix element of the field defining the separable interaction and @xmath33 is the normalization constant determined by the condition @xmath34 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath5li was already evaluated within the cxsm including antibound states  @xcite . here",
    "we will repeat that calculation in order to determine the two - particle states to be used in the calculation of the three - particle system , i.e. , @xmath0li . for this we will use the multistep shell model method , which we will briefly describe below .      as its name indicates",
    ", the multistep shell model method ( msm ) solves the shell model equations in several steps . in the first step the single - particle representation",
    "is chosen . in the second step",
    "the energies and wave functions of the two - particle system are evaluated by using a given two - particle interaction .",
    "the three - particle states are evaluated in terms of a basis consisting of the tensorial product of the one- and two - particle states previously obtained . in this and",
    "subsequent steps the interaction does not appear explicitly in the formalism . instead , it is the wave functions and energies of the components of the msm basis that replace the interaction .",
    "the msm basis is overcomplete and non - orthogonal . to correct",
    "this one needs to evaluate the overlap matrix among the basis states also .",
    "a general description of the formalism is in ref .",
    "the particular system that is of our interest here , i.e. , the three - particle case , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the msm was applied to study the three - neutron hole states in the nucleus @xmath35pb .    using the berggren single - particle representation described above",
    ", we will evaluate the complex energies and wave functions of @xmath0li using the msm basis states consisting of the berggren one - particular states , which are states in @xmath36li , times the two - particle states corresponding to @xmath5li .",
    "below we refer to this formalism as cxmsm .",
    "the three - particle energies @xmath37 are given by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xmath40 and the rest of the notation is standard .",
    "the matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ tda3 ] ) is not hermitian and the dimension may be larger than the corresponding shell - model dimension .",
    "this is due to the violations of the pauli principle as well as overcounting of states in the cxmsm basis .",
    "therefore the direct diagonalization of eq .",
    "( [ tda3 ] ) is not convenient .",
    "one needs to calculate the overlap matrix in order to transform the cxmsm basis into an orthonormal set . in this three - particle case",
    "the overlap matrix is @xmath41    using this matrix ( [ overlap ] ) one can transform the matrix determined by eq .",
    "( [ tda3 ] ) into a hermitian matrix @xmath42 which has the right dimension .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath42 provides the three - particle energies .",
    "the corresponding wave function amplitudes can be readily evaluated to obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the three - particle creation operator .",
    "it has to be pointed out that in cases where the basis is overcomplete the amplitudes @xmath45 are not well defined .",
    "but this is no hinder to evaluate the physical quantities . for details",
    "@xcite .",
    "the advantage of the msm in stable nuclei is that one can study the influence of collective vibrations upon nuclear spectra within the framework of the shell model .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite the multiple structure of particle - vibration coupled states in odd pb isotopes was analyzed .",
    "but the most important feature for our purpose is that the cxmsm allows one to choose in the basis states a limited number of excitations .",
    "this is because in the continuum the vast majority of basis states consists of scattering functions .",
    "these do not affect greatly physically meaningful two - particle states .",
    "that is , the majority of the two - particle states provided by the cxsm are complex states which form a part of the continuum background .",
    "only a few of those calculated states correspond to physically meaningful resonances , i.e. , resonances which can be observed .",
    "below we call a  resonance \" only to a complex state which is meaningful .",
    "these resonances are mainly built upon single - particle states which are either bound or narrow resonances .",
    "yet , one can not ignore the continuum when evaluating the resonances .",
    "the continuum configurations in the resonance wave function are small but many , and they affect the two - particle resonance significantly @xcite . that is , the important continuum configurations to induce resonances are contained in the corresponding resonance wave functions .",
    "therefore , the great advantage of the cxmsm is that one can include in the basis only two - particle resonances , while neglecting the background continuum states , which form the vast majority of complex two - particle states .",
    "the question is which are the two - particle states that are indeed resonances .",
    "this , and also the question of how to evaluate and recognize the physically meaningful three - particle states , are addressed in the next section .",
    "in this section we will apply the cxmsm formalism described above to study the nucleus @xmath0li . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will take the core to be the nucleus @xmath1li .",
    "this is justified since the three protons included in this core can be considered frozen and , therefore , merely spectators  @xcite .    to evaluate the valence shells we will proceed as in refs . @xcite and choose as central field a woods - saxon potential with different depths for even and odd orbital angular momenta @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding parameters are ( in parenthesis for odd @xmath46-values ) @xmath47= 0.670 fm , @xmath48 = 1.27 fm , @xmath49 = 50.0 ( 36.9 ) mev and @xmath50=16.5 ( 12.6 ) mev . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we thus found the single - particle bound states @xmath51 at -23.280 mev and @xmath52 at -2.589 mev forming the @xmath53li core .",
    "the valence shells are the low lying resonances @xmath54 at ( 0.195,-0.047 ) mev and @xmath55 at ( 2.731 , -0.545 ) mev and the shell @xmath56 at ( 6.458,-5.003 ) mev .",
    "this can not be considered as a resonance , since it is so wide that rather it is a part of the background .",
    "besides , the state @xmath57 appears as an antibound state at -0.050 mev .",
    "we thus reproduce the experimental single - particle energies as given in ref .",
    "we also found other states at higher energies , but they do not affect our calculation because they are very high and also very wide to be considered as meaningful resonances .",
    "we thus include in our berggren representation only the antibound state @xmath57 and the resonances @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the energy of the resonance @xmath54 has been contested and instead the value ( 0.563,-0.252 ) mev was proposed @xcite . since this is an important quantity in the determination of the two- and three - particle spectra , we will use both of them in our calculations .",
    "we obtained this @xmath54 energy ( i.e. , ( 0.563,-0.252 ) mev ) by choosing @xmath49=34.755 mev for @xmath46 odd while keeping all the other parameters as before .    to define the berggren single - particle representation we still have to choose the integration contour @xmath58 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : delb ] ) ) .    to include in the representation the antibound @xmath57 state as well as the gamow resonances @xmath54 and",
    "@xmath55 we will use two different contours .",
    "the number of points on each contour defines the energies of the scattering functions in the berggren representation , i.e. , the number of basis states corresponding to the continuum background . this number is not uniformity distributed , since in segments of the contour which are close to the antibound state or to a resonance the scattering functions increase strongly .",
    "we therefore chose the density of points to be larger in those segments .",
    "we include the antibound state by using the contour in fig .",
    "[ cont ] .",
    "denote bound state energies while @xmath59 denotes the antiboud state .",
    "the points @xmath60 correspond to the vertices defining the contour .",
    "they have the values @xmath61=(-0.05,0.05 ) mev , @xmath62=(-0.1,0 ) mev , @xmath63=(0,-0.4 ) mev , @xmath64=(0.5,-0.4 ) mev , @xmath65=(8,-0.4 ) mev , @xmath66=(8,0 ) mev and @xmath67=(10,0 ) mev , title=\"fig : \" ] +    the number of points in each segment are given in table [ ngp ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also found that @xmath0li(gs ) is an antibound state but , in addition , two other low - lying states were observed at 0.250 mev and 0.555 mev by using two - proton removal reactions . in this case",
    "the @xmath52 proton in the core may interfere with the neutron excitations evaluated above .",
    "in particular , the antibound @xmath2 ground state would provide , through the proton excitation , a state @xmath68 and a @xmath69 .",
    "this is the situation encountered in the shell model calculation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . as we have pointed out above , from the cxmsm viewpoint the very unstable states determining the spectrum in this nucleus , with wave functions which are both diverging and complex , can hardly be described by harmonic oscillator representations . to investigate the relation between the results provided by both representations we repeated the shell - model calculation of ref .",
    "we thus took @xmath70he as the core and used the wbt effective interaction @xcite .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian matrix was diagonalized by using the code described in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding calculated energies , which agree with those presented in @xcite , are shown in fig .",
    "[ smen ] .",
    "+    one sees in this figure that the full calculation predicts all excited states to lie well above the corresponding experimental values .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the calculated states exhibit rather pure shell model configurations .",
    "for instance the states @xmath71 ( ground state ) and @xmath72 are mainly composed of the configuration @xmath73\\nu \\left [ ( 0p_{1/2})^2 1s_{1/2}\\right]\\rangle$ ] .",
    "this does not fully agree with our cxmsm calculation , since in our case this wave function is mainly of the form @xmath74 .",
    "this differs from the shell model case in two ways .",
    "first , the state @xmath5li(gs ) contains nearly as much of @xmath57 as of @xmath54 .",
    "second the continuum states contribute much in the building up of the antibound @xmath0li(gs ) wave function , as discussed above . in our representation",
    "it is straightforward to discern the antibound character of this state , which is not the case when using harmonic oscillator bases .",
    "the shell model splittings between states originated from the same configurations in fig .",
    "[ smen ] are due to the neutron - proton interaction , which in some cases can be large . for instance , the matrix elements @xmath75\\nu[0p_{1/2}];j|v|\\pi[0p_{3/2}]\\nu[0p_{1/2}];j\\rangle$ ] are strong and attractive  @xcite .",
    "given all the uncertainties related to these calculations in the continuum , and the scarce amount of experimental data , we will not attempt to evaluate the @xmath0li states by adding a new uncertainty which would be the inclusion of a proton - neutron interaction .    considering the limitations that one expects from a calculation of very unstable states by using harmonic oscillator basis ,",
    "the rather good agreement between the shell - model and the cxmsm presented above is surprising .",
    "in contrast to the shell - model , the cxmsm provides not only the energies but also the widths of the resonances .",
    "it is therefore very important to encourage experimental groups to try to obtain these quantities in order to probe the formalisms .",
    "in this paper we have studied excitations occurring in the continuum part of the nuclear spectrum which are at the limit of what can be observed within present experimental facilities .",
    "these states are very unstable but yet live a time long enough to be amenable to be treated within stationary formalisms .",
    "we have thus adopted the cxsm ( shell model in the complex energy plane @xcite ) for this purpose .",
    "in addition we performed the shell model calculation by using the multistep shell model . in this method of solving the shell model equations one proceeds in several steps . in each step one constructs building blocks to be used in future steps @xcite .",
    "we applied this formalism to analyze @xmath0li as determined by the neutron degrees of freedom , i.e. , the three protons in the core were considered to be frozen . in this case",
    "the excitations correspond to the motion of three particles , partitioned as the one - particle times the two - particle systems .",
    "this formalism was applied before , e.g. , to study multiplets in the lead region @xcite .    by using single - particle energies ( i.e. , states in @xmath36li ) as provided by experimental data when available or as provided by our calculation , we found that the only physically meaningful two - particle states are @xmath5li(gs ) , which is a bound state , and @xmath5li(@xmath76 ) , which is a resonance . as a result",
    "there are only three physically meaningful states in @xmath0li which , besides the antibound ground state , it is predicted that there is a resonance @xmath3 lying at about 1 mev and about 800 kev wide and another resonance which is @xmath4 lying at about 1.1 mev and 500 kev wide .",
    "that the ground state is an antibound ( or virtual ) state was confirmed by a number of experiments @xcite and the state @xmath4 has probably been observed in @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite two additional states , lying at rather low energies , have been observed which do not seem to correspond to the calculated levels .",
    "it has to be mentioned that neither a shell model calculation , performed within an harmonic oscillator basis , provides satisfactory results in this case .",
    "yet , we found that this shell model calculation works better than one would assume given the unstable character of the states involved .",
    "we therefore conclude that in order to probe the formalisms that have been introduced to describe these very unstable systems additional experimental data , specially regarding the widths of the resonances , would be required .",
