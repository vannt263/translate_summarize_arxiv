    "the case of one brane leads to the relative formality theorem @xcite for the hochschild cochains of the sections of the exterior algebra of the normal bundle of a submanifold and is related to quantization of hamiltonian reduction of coisotropic submanifolds in poisson manifolds . here",

    "? the previous question generalizes , in the framework of @xmath6-algebras and modules , a similar problem for dg algebras and dg modules , solved by keller in  @xcite , and recently brought to attention in the framework of deformation quantization by shoikhet  @xcite .    in fact ,",
    "when @xmath11 and @xmath12 are dg algebras and @xmath31 is a dg @xmath11-@xmath12-bimodules , we may consider the dg category @xmath412 as in section  [ s-2 ] .",
    "analogously , we may consider the hochschild cochain complex of @xmath412 with values in itself : again , it splits into three pieces , and the hochschild differential @xmath277 , uniquely determined by the dg structures on @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath31 , splits into five pieces .    again ,",
    "the two natural projections @xmath120 and @xmath121 from @xmath413 onto @xmath249 and @xmath411 are morphisms of complexes : keller  @xcite has proved that both projections are quasi - isomorphisms , if the derived left- and right - actions @xmath118 and @xmath119 from @xmath11 and @xmath12 to @xmath414 and @xmath415 respectively are quasi - isomorphisms . here ,",
    "e.g.  @xmath416 denotes the right - derived functor of @xmath417 in the derived category @xmath418 of the category @xmath419 of graded right @xmath12-modules , whose spaces of morphisms are specified by @xmath420).\\ ] ] the cohomology of the complex @xmath414 computes the derived functor @xmath421 ; accordingly , @xmath118 denotes the derived right action of @xmath11 on @xmath31 in the framework of derived categories .",

    "thus , the derived left- and right - action in the @xmath6-framework truly generalize the corresponding derived left- and right - action in the case of a dg category , with the obvious advantage of providing explicit formul  involving homotopies .",

    "lemma  [ l - hoch - mix ] , subsection  [ ss-3 - 2 ] yields the isomorphism of complexes @xmath431 as already observed , composition with the derived left action @xmath118 defines a morphism of complexes from @xmath249 to @xmath432 : from this , and by the arguments of subsection  [ ss-2 - 1 ] , it is easy to see that @xmath433 is precisely the cone of the morphism induced by composition with @xmath118 , which we denote improperly by @xmath434 .",
    "it is now a standard fact that , for any @xmath6-quasi - isomorphism of @xmath6-algebras @xmath435 , the induced cochain map @xmath436 is a quasi - isomorphism , where @xmath12 is viewed as an @xmath6-@xmath11-@xmath11-bimodule as explained at the end of subsection  [ ss-3 - 1 ] .    therefore , @xmath434 is quasi - isomorphic to the cone of the identity map on @xmath249 , which is obviously acyclic .",
    "if the @xmath6-structures on @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath31 are allowed to have infinitely many taylor components , then theorem [ t - keller ] remains true for completed variants of hochschild complexes .",
