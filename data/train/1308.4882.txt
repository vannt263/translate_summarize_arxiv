    "the theoretical prediction@xcite and subsequent experimental confirmation@xcite of the kondo effect in a quantum dot represents , without doubt , a prominent research highlight in the field of nanoscopic physics .",
    "while the kondo effect of impurities in bulk metals induces a reduction of the conductance@xcite , its nanoscopic realization leads to an enhancement due to quantum many - body effects .",
    "more recently , the kondo effect was also observed in double quantum dots@xcite . here , the two quantum dots may act as a pseudospin in analogy to spin - up and -down for the usual kondo effect in a single quantum dot .",
    "combined , spin and pseudospin can give rise to an enhanced su(4 ) kondo effect .",
    "such double quantum dots are particularly exciting from the fundamental research point of view since ( pseudo-)spin - up and -down can be controlled separately and their conductance can be measured independently@xcite .    besides for their electrical conductance ,",
    "quantum dots are also considered as potential solid state energy converters@xcite .",
    "the high degree of tunability of nanoscale devices allows them to be operated at optimal thermoelectric efficiency . promising in this respect",
    "are ultrasharp resonances which can be achieved through the kondo effect@xcite . however , for the single - dot kondo effect , the resonance is centered around the fermi level so that electron and hole contributions cancel .",
    "the thermopower is vanishingly small@xcite . a possibility to move the resonance away from the fermi level is applying an external magnetic field .",
    "this splits the kondo resonance with one spin - species above and the other below the fermi energy , but the total ( spin - averaged ) thermopower stays small@xcite .",
    "another idea has been to employ the charge kondo effect , realized in an anderson impurity model with attractive interaction@xcite .",
    "this is however difficult to realize experimentally .",
    "it requires e.g.  a strong electron - phonon coupling to realize an effective interaction that is attractive .    in this paper",
    ", we show that a capacitively coupled double quantum dot in the kondo regime ultimately overcomes these difficulties .",
    "such double dots , which are already realized experimentally , represent a stand - alone thermoelectric generator , see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . given an external heat gradient , ( quasi-)electrons and holes dominate the linear transport in the two respective quantum dots such that a total current is generated if the quantum dots are suitably connected .",
    "we stress that the same theoretical concept can be realized in experimentally very distinct systems , such as molecular transport@xcite and cold atoms@xcite .",
    "basis of our calculations is the experimentally realized double quantum dot of ref .  .",
    "the experimental signatures of the kondo physics in the conductance are well described by an anderson impurity model@xcite with a single spin - degenerate level in each dot : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath4 in dot @xmath5 with energy level @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the coulomb interaction on quantum dot @xmath8 ( for simplicity we use @xmath9 in the following ) , and @xmath10 is the capacitive coupling between the two dots . note that there is no direct tunneling between the two dots .",
    "@xmath11 is the creation operator for an electron in the source or drain lead @xmath12 with wavenumber @xmath13 and energy @xmath14 .",
    "the leads are coupled to quantum dot @xmath8 by the hybridization @xmath15 , which corresponds to a tunneling rate @xmath16 for a constant lead density of states @xmath17 ( which can be taken as lead independent since only the combination @xmath18 is of relevance ) .    as in ref .  , the numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite approach is used to calculate the spectral function @xmath19 of the two quantum dots from which the conductance @xmath20 , the thermopower @xmath21 , and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductance @xmath22 can be determined in linear response via the meir - wingreen formula@xcite , see ref .  :",
    "@xmath23\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath24 is the elementary charge , @xmath25 the temperature , and @xmath26 denote the transport integrals @xmath27 where the transmission is given by @xmath28 the @xmath26 are thus the moments of the spectral function weighted by the derivative of the fermi function @xmath29 around the fermi energy @xmath30 .",
    "for a better understanding , we consider the sommerfeld expansion of the thermopower at low @xmath25 : @xmath31 in the absence of a magnetic field @xmath32 is spin independent .",
    "a large thermopower is thus obtained for a highly asymmetric @xmath19 with a large slope in the derivative at the fermi energy @xmath33 and a small @xmath34 .",
    "as we will see below , in the kondo regime of a double quantum dot , such an asymmetry with opposite slope for the two dots is indeed possible  in contrast to the single quantum dot case .",
    "the physical constraints for a large thermopower can be further elucidated by relating @xmath19 to the occupation @xmath35 of dot @xmath8 for spin @xmath36 via the friedel sum rule .",
    "the dot- and spin - resolved thermopower can hence be expressed as@xcite @xmath37 with the linear coefficient of the specific heat @xmath38 . for a single quantum dot in the kondo regime ,",
    "@xmath39 so that @xmath40 is vanishingly small@xcite . applying an external magnetic field leads to , say , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "hence , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , but the total thermopower @xmath45 remains small@xcite .",
    "for the double quantum dot , we have a similar situation but with the two distinct dots ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) now playing the role of the spin ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "if there was not an additional spin - degree of freedom for the double dot , we would even have the same situation , except for one important difference : the two contributions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are now spatially separated .",
    "hence for a proper geometry , @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be even employed as the @xmath52- and @xmath53-type part of a thermoelectric device , see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "we note that the case of an _ attractive _",
    "interaction@xcite is related to the magnetic field situation , by a particle - hole transformation for one spin species . for",
    "the particle - hole transformed spin species , this also changes the sign of @xmath54 ; there is no cancellation in @xmath45 .",
    "we now analyze the thermoelectric properties , the conductance , the thermopower or seebeck coefficient , and the thermal conductivity , of the double quantum dot of ref .  .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] summarizes the nrg results obtained for the anderson model described by , with @xmath55ev , @xmath56ev , @xmath57ev , @xmath58ev , @xmath59ev , and @xmath60ev at @xmath61mk , see . here",
    ", the one - particle energy levels @xmath62 are related to the gate voltages applied to the up and down quantum dot by @xmath63 the results for the conductance through both quantum dots ( upper panel ) reproduce the experimental data as illustrated in ref .  .",
    "increasing the gate voltage @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) of the two electrodes 1,2 ( 3,4 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , the number of electrons in the up ( down ) dot is increased by one ; at the degeneracy point the coulomb blockade is lifted leading to an enhanced conductance . due to the capacitive coupling of the dots , the gate voltages @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "do not only affect the up and down quantum dot individually , but both dots . as a consequence , instead of a square - like pattern",
    "a characteristic honeycomb structure emerges in the charge stability diagram as depicted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "since the anderson impurity model describes the measured conductance very well , we are confident that the theoretical results for the thermoelectric properties correspond to the actual experimental situation .",
    "the central panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show the thermopower @xmath21 of the two quantum dots ( left and right panel , respectively ) .",
    "negative ( blue ) values indicate the flow of negatively charged ( quasi-)electrons from the hot to the cold side of an external heat gradient , and positive ( red ) values the flow of positively charged ( quasi-)holes . at the maximal conductance ( see upper panel ) , the thermopower is rather small . shifting the gate voltages slightly away from this maximum , e.g. , to the cross @xmath66 indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , a large thermopower develops whose values are particularly enhanced in the kondo regime , for both quantum dots but with opposite sign .",
    "hence , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , a thermal gradient induces a current in opposite direction through the up and down quantum dot .",
    "this means that the double quantum dot constitutes a thermoelectric device .",
    "connecting the drain electrodes of the two quantum dots , i.e. , employing an even simpler design were the two drain electrodes are substituted by a bar or large quantum dot , the two source electrodes @xmath67 and @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] act as the plus and minus source of a power supply .",
    "( upper panel ) , seebeck coefficient @xmath69 ( central panel ) , and thermal conductivity @xmath70 ( lower panel ) for the double quantum dot of ref .   as a function of the applied gate voltages @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the left ( right ) panels show the transport through the up ( down ) quantum dot as calculated by nrg , see text for the parameters .",
    "the kondo resonance develops in proximity of the degeneracy line between ( @xmath71,@xmath72 ) and ( @xmath72,@xmath71 ) electrons in the ( up , down ) quantum dot , see charge stability diagram in the upper panels .",
    "close to the maximum in the conductance , the seebeck coefficient of the up ( down ) quantum dot is positive ( negative ) indicating charge transport of opposite sign through the two dots .",
    "[ fig2 ] , width=226 ]    to further elucidate the understanding of the large thermopower of opposite sign , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the spectral functions of both quantum dots for the gate voltages indicated in fig .",
    "we observe that the sharp kondo resonance of the two quantum dots is located directly below and above the fermi level for the up and down quantum dot , respectively .",
    "hence , the spectral functions @xmath19 are highly asymmetric around the fermi level . on the contrary , for a symmetric behavior around the fermi level ( dashed line in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) electrons and holes alike migrate from the hot to the cold side and their net current cancels , @xmath73 . in general",
    "we have such a symmetric situation on the line separating the @xmath74 and @xmath75 occupation regions ( see upper panel of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "changing the gate voltages perpendicular to this line leads to a splitting of the @xmath76- and @xmath47-dot kondo resonance , similar to applying a magnetic field for a single quantum dot .",
    "note that due to its larger hybridization or tunneling rate @xmath77 , the down dot has a much wider resonance and the situation is not completely symmetric . as a function of temperature ,",
    "the maximum in the thermopower occurs on a temperature scale which correlates with the gate voltage and is therefore highly tunable .",
    "however , a systematic study of the temperature dependence has not been performed for the device considered here .",
    "an efficient thermoelectric element is characterized also by a low thermal conductivity @xmath70 which determines the thermoelectric figure of merit defined by@xcite @xmath78 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the electronic contribution to @xmath70 determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "the double dot exhibits a maximum in the thermal conductivity in correspondence of a maximum in the conductance .",
    "a large thermopower is however observed slightly off this maximum , where the thermal conductivity is strongly suppressed",
    ".    for the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath79 also the phononic contribution to the thermal conductivity @xmath80 has to be considered . for a reduced electronic ( thermal ) conductivity , this phononic contribution is dominating .",
    "in contrast to bulk materials , the thermal conductivity of nanostructures can be strongly suppressed .",
    "this is exploited in phonon engineering@xcite which led to a historic breakthrough of higher figure of merit @xmath81 achieved in nanostructured materials , e.g.  for quantum dot lattices@xcite . on general grounds",
    ", one can expect a suppressed phononic contribution to the thermal conductivity for nanostructures below the typical phonon mean free path .",
    "for semiconductors such as si and gaas this mean free path is 0.1 - 1 @xmath82m,@xcite such that the phononic thermal conductivity is expected to be small .    in the case of the molecule instead of the quantum dot realization ,",
    "the phonon contribution has been estimated in ref .   to be between @xmath83 ( best case , no phonons ) and @xmath84 ( worst case , maximal phonon contribution ) , resulting in @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , for the attractive ( negative ) @xmath87 single quantum dot .",
    "due to the aforementioned particle - role relation , similar values for an optimal figure of merit are to be expected for our case of a double dot ( or molecule ) with repulsive @xmath87 ; the actual @xmath81 of the presented calculations which are based on the experimentally realized quantum dots@xcite and @xmath61mk , instead of parameters optimizing the thermoelectric properties , are smaller .",
    "let us also remark that comparable efficiencies can be obtained also for non - interacting quantum dots , albeit at temperatures @xmath88 , while for the kondo quantum dots the maximal @xmath81 is at @xmath89 .     of the up ( down ) quantum dot for @xmath90mv and @xmath91mv , corresponding to a pronounced thermopower ( @xmath66 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( solid lines ) .",
    "the main spectral weight of the kondo resonance is below ( above ) the fermi level at @xmath30 . for comparison the spectral function for a reduced thermopower ( @xmath92 )",
    "are shown ( dashed lines ) .",
    "[ fig3],width=245 ]",
    "we have shown that a double quantum dot in the kondo regime can be employed as a thermoelectric power generator .",
    "our calculations are based on the experiment of ref .",
    "whose focus was the demonstration of kondo correlations in the electric transport , not to optimize the thermoelectric properties .",
    "hence , the study of different parameter regimes offers plenty of room to improve the thermopower and thermoelectric figure of merit .",
    "in fact , the relevant energy scales of the double quantum dot considered were in the @xmath82ev and mk regime , which makes these particular quantum dots unpractical for applications , except for peltier cooling at ultra low temperatures in the mk regime which might be of interest for basic research devices . however , reducing the size of the quantum dots from @xmath82 m towards nm , the corresponding energy and temperature scales will be simply rescaled , as @xmath81 .",
    "this can be pushed to even smaller sizes by employing molecules instead of quantum dots in molecular electronics@xcite . in view of future applications , multiple quantum dots connected through a common back electrode ( joint drain in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) provide a scalable setup , in which the generated power can be harvested through wires connecting the p- and n - type quantum dots separately .",
    "possibly most promising is the integration of the double quantum dot thermoelectric element on computer chips . here",
    "the complex and otherwise expensive semiconductor device fabrication with photolithographic and chemical processing is employed anyhow . at the same time , the power consumption and cooling of waste heat has become a critical issue for computer chip design .",
    "on - chip cooling e.g.  through liquid - filled microchannels is presently explored as a possible solution@xcite , which would involve additional technology and processing steps . here",
    ", the proposed double quantum dot device is much simpler .",
