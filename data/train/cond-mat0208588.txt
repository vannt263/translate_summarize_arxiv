    "exciton dynamics experiments are attracting continuos interest because of their suitability to explore dephasing effects of single exciton and multiexciton complexes@xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent proposals for solid state quantum computing systems@xcite , have stressed the importance of properly controlling multiexciton coherences .",
    "recently , the non - classical behaviour of the light emitted from a sqd , photon antibunching in the fluorescence spectrum , has been observed in the ultrafast regime@xcite .",
    "additionally , the search for single photon sources@xcite has triggered experimental interest in transient multiexciton coherences .",
    "all of these exciton based phenomena reflect the importance of interparticle interactions ( electrons and holes ) and their couplings to the environment , e.g , phonons .",
    "both coherent and incoherent effects are experimentally detected .",
    "incoherent effects are related to the system - bath interaction and from a theoretical point of view they are usually modeled within a markov approximation .",
    "coherent effects are associated with multiple particle correlations and can be observed in the subpicosecond time scale .",
    "consequently , a detailed understanding of the coherence persistence at short times is of most importance in nanostructure systems .",
    "time resolved fwm experiments give signatures of particle - particle correlations and particle - environment interactions . in a typical fwm experiment , two simultaneous excitation pulses co- or cross - circularly polarized , with wave vectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 , propagate onto the sample .",
    "a third laser pulse , with wave vector @xmath2 , is sent time delayed at @xmath3 . for moderate excitation intensities",
    ", exciton - exciton interaction arises .",
    "the time evolution of the third order polarization @xmath4 describes the properties of the diffracted light in the @xmath5 direction . at very short times after the excitation",
    ", particle correlations build up .",
    "these correlations have been observed using spectral interferometry techniques in bulk systems@xcite .",
    "it is also possible to study the polarization phase dynamics itself , @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , other experiments for measuring @xmath7 , like pump and probe schemes , have also been performed . in particular in ref.@xcite",
    "a simple four level model has been used to get the non - linear optical response ( @xmath8 ) of a sqd . from the frequency spectrum of @xmath8 ,",
    "the possibility of getting exciton entanglement in a sqd has been predicted .",
    "however , in that work exciton correlations were included within a mean field approach ( mfa ) .",
    "exciton dephasing times ( @xmath9 ) have been well characterized in bulk and quantum well systems . in particular ,",
    "ultrafast dynamics experiments , like time - resolved speckle analysis , have been used to get dephasing times information in solids@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent experiments in bulk systems show the build up of many particle correlations in the femtosecond scale of time@xcite .",
    "recently , all of these dynamical phenomena have been observed for first time in self assembled qds using transient fwm spectroscopy@xcite where the time integrated fwm signal oscillates with the biexciton binding energy .",
    "besides that , dephasing mechanism from optical longitudinal ( lo ) phonons has been observed in cdse bulk and quantum dots systems , showing clearly non - markovian effects associated to the coupling between carriers and lo phonons@xcite .",
    "due to its atomic like characteristics , a sqd offers the unique possibility of manipulating the number of particles and their coulomb interactions ( exciton - exciton ( x - x ) ) with direct consequences on decoherence processes control .",
    "thus , rather long dephasing times ( @xmath10 40 ps ) have been reported@xcite .",
    "a natural question arises when ultrafast scale of times are involved : what kind of quasiparticle ( free electron - hole pairs , exciton or bound excitons ) are dominant ? .",
    "in order to answer this question we consider the phase space filling ( psf ) effect and x - x interactions on the same footing . within mfa , the fwm signal shows contributions coming from both , psf effects as well as renormalized x - x interactions . however , this approximation fails to explain correlations at very short times .",
    "therefore , mfa should be improved by considering quantum fluctuation effects to explain transient fwm experiments . in particular , more elaborated theoretical approaches like the one reported in ref.@xcite , where a truncation in the hierarchy of polarization equations of motion to fifth order in the optical electric field is proposed , are shown to improve mfa results by including four particle correlations .",
    "aditionally , some previous reported works@xcite show that in bulk systems a mean - field approach to calculate the fwm signal gives errors because the exact x - x correlations are neglected .    in the present work ,",
    "we go beyond previous limitations like few level systems and mfa .",
    "we use a truncation scheme similar to one developed for bulk systems@xcite , in which the contribution from exciton and exciton - exciton effects can be split and treated on an equal footing to any desired order in the optical field@xcite",
    ". however , the truncation scheme fails to evaluate exactly the x - x coulomb interaction due to the intensive computational work involved in its application to bulk systems . in order to get feasible results ,",
    "this scheme has been used mapping the problem to a one - dimensional hubbard model@xcite . in the present work",
    "we undertake this problem and we include exact x - x correlations in order to find the non - linear optical signal , intensity and phase dynamics in a realistic model of a sqd in the ultrafast regime . in section 2 , we briefly review the theoretical background on which our results are based .",
    "section 3 describes the main results of this work .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "our starting point is the hamiltonian for a system of electrons and holes in a two - dimensional parabolic quantum dot excited by external laser pulses @xmath11 where @xmath12 creates and destroys one electron(hole ) in the state @xmath13 ( labeled by quantum numbers @xmath14 ) with spin @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , spin up , @xmath17 , spin - down ) .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 , denote electron - electron , electron - hole and hole - hole coulomb interactions , respectively .",
    "single particle energies for electrons ( holes ) are given by @xmath20 , with confinement energies @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 is the parabolic confinement length size of the electron(hole ) . the set of laser pulses used to excite the sqd",
    "is described by the envelope amplitude @xmath24 and associated dipole moments @xmath25 which take into account pulse polarizations .",
    "the spins of the electron ( @xmath15 ) and hole ( @xmath26 ) determine the corresponding polarization index @xmath27 _ i.e. _ @xmath28 . by diagonalizing the time - independent part of the hamiltonian eq.([hamilton ] ) ( @xmath29 ) , the energies and wave functions for one and two excitons in a sqd are obtained , from which the non - linear optical response is calculated .",
    "exciton and biexciton wave functions are given respectively , in terms of non - interacting electron - hole pairs , as @xmath30 @xmath31 is the sqd ground state and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the exciton and biexciton amplitudes , respectively , which take properly into account the carriers spin configuration . in the following formulas we will stick to the notation of eq.([eq : f - ondax - xx ] ) where the index @xmath34 labels an exciton state , whereas the index @xmath35 is reserved for the labeling of biexciton states .    in discussing the time",
    "resolved spectra , we will be concerned with the situation in which the sqd is excited by very short laser pulses ( @xmath36 functions ) in resonance with the @xmath37 heavy - exciton state .",
    "therefore , a big number of single particle states has to be included in the calculation of one and two exciton spectra .",
    "the applicability of the @xmath36-pulses limit can be extended to typical accoustic periods when interaction with lo phonons can be neglected , compared with the deformation potential .",
    "however , it will be very important in ii - vi semiconductors due to this high enough polar coupling .",
    "our results are related with iii - v systems , in which this coupling is low . in this way , when coherent phenomena coming from the oscillations of exciton or biexciton - phonon complexes are lost , incoherent phenomena aquires more importance and after this time it is well known that a phenomenological model of decoherence , as the one we will adopt here , can be used .",
    "we perform our theoretical calculations following a truncation scheme @xcite of the hilbert space of one exciton and two interacting excitons . after a long algebra",
    "it is possible to give analytical expressions for the transient non - linear optical signal , which is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "it can be described as the sum of three terms : one representing the psf ( @xmath38 ) contribution , another one corresponding to the mfa term ( @xmath39 ) and a third one related to the x - x contribution ( @xmath40 . this last term describes exact four - particle correlations and memory effects in terms of the so called force - force time correlation function .",
    "all these terms can be calculated for a sqd described by the hamiltonian eq.([hamilton ] ) , giving place to expressions similar but not equal to those of ref.@xcite ( the differences are due to the confinement geometry of the dot , see the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "the resulting expressions for each one of these contributions for a sqd are given explicitly by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is related to the exciton wave function at zero relative distance , @xmath43 is the psf parameter ( for notation details , see ref.@xcite ) and @xmath44 denotes the step function ( @xmath45=1 ) . the mfa contribution can be written as @xmath46 \\label{meanfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 similarly , the x - x contribution is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50   % p_{n1}^{mf}(t , t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 in eqs.([beta ] ) and ( [ xx ] ) , @xmath35 runs over all ( bound and unbound ) biexciton states . bound biexcitonic states are those for which its energy lies below two times the ground state energy of an exciton .",
    "aditionally , @xmath52 and @xmath53 take into account the exciton and biexciton transition weights on the signal produced by the @xmath54 exciton state .",
    "the exciton transition weights @xmath55 are defined to be the matrix elements @xmath56 of the product of two @xmath57 exciton destruction operators @xmath58 between the exciton ground state @xmath59 and a biexciton state @xmath60 . finally , all we need is : exciton , @xmath61 , and biexciton , @xmath62 , energies and their respective wave functions , which can be numerically obtained to any desired precision in the sqd case . from these ingredients ,",
    "the exciton transition weights can be calculated as @xmath63 where the exciton destruction operator is @xmath64 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath65 is the @xmath34-th exciton amplitude ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq : f - ondax - xx ] ) ) .",
    "one of the main results of our paper is that , in contrast to an extended system , for qds the term @xmath66 does not vanish , _ even _ in the case of cross - polarized ( cp ) excitation .",
    "if the dot confinement energies are reduced , in the cp case @xmath66 decreases in magnitude , approaching zero in the limit of zero confinement ( extended system ) .",
    "this can be seen by direct evaluation of the parameter @xmath67 in eq.([beta ] ) , that gives information on the strength of the signal as predicted by mfa .",
    "although , the @xmath67 term contains information about the renormalized biexciton energy , this term is not responsible for oscillations and only contributes with an spectral weight given by the @xmath68 changing the intensity of the fwm signal .",
    "the total dynamics of excitons and biexcitons comprises the mf and the exact x - x contributions .",
    "the temporal dynamics dependence of @xmath39 ( apart from an exponential damping ) is contained in eq.([ax ] ) where only contributions from differences of exciton energy levels appear , which are negligible in the case of resonant excitation .",
    "on the other hand , the temporal dependence of the x - x contribution is dominated by energy differences between two exciton states and one biexciton state , e.g. eq.([axx ] ) . in particular , in the cp case",
    ", a bound biexcitonic state is present , causing oscillations in the signal with a frequency corresponding to the energy of the bound state .",
    "exciton and biexciton dephasing rates associated to non - radiative mechanisms are described ( phenomenologically ) by @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively . in the following",
    "we will concentrate only in the lowest exciton state , i.e. @xmath71 with @xmath72 . in our model , the dephasing time @xmath9 is defined as the inverse of @xmath70 .",
    "in order to calculate the fwm signal for a typical self - assambled sqd@xcite , we consider a @xmath73 quantum dot with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 mev and @xmath78 mev . to guarantee a good convergence for the spectrum of zero total angular momentum excitons and biexcitons , we diagonalize a 72x72 hamiltonian matrix for excitons and a 3250x3250 hamiltonian matrix for biexcitons .",
    "the exciton spin is determined by the circular polarization of the excitation pulses . further in this work",
    "we discuss only the cross polarization excitation case . with this set of parameters the biexciton binding",
    "energy is -1.27 mev    as discussed in section 2 , the fwm signal clearly depends on @xmath79 , on the exciton and biexciton energies as well as on the transition spectral weights .",
    "excitation pulses create coherent excitons whose dephasing time ( @xmath9 ) can be monitored by the delayed pulse . as the time delay increases , the fwm signal decreases from which @xmath9 can be obtained . with these ingredients , and considering that more than one electronic excitation can be induced by the laser and four particle correlations occur for times lesser than @xmath80 , we expect that interference phenomena appear in the ultrafast time scale .",
    "therefore , the coherent fwm signal and the phase dynamics give clear signatures of exciton - exciton interactions in the ultrafast regime . in the following we will not be concerned with @xmath9 determination , which is to be taken as a free parameter .",
    "pulses with zero time delay , @xmath81 , will be considered .    in the weak intensity regime",
    "both psf and x - x effects determine the nonlinear optical properties .",
    "we will concentrate on these two contributions .",
    "psf contributions to the fwm signal are only important in the parallel spin exciton case , where x - x effects are negligible , because a bound biexciton state does not exist at all .",
    "by contrast , for the cross polarization situation we are interested in , psf effects are vanishing while x - x effects become dominant .",
    "it is important to remark that in extended and isotropic systems the mfa gives a zero contribution to the fwm signal , because only excited excitons with zero center of mass momentum contribute , i.e.,(@xmath82)@xcite .",
    "however , in sqd this condition can be relaxed due to the fact that the parabolic potential absorbs the incident momentum and excitons with center of mass momentum different from zero can be excited .",
    "this point becomes particularly clear by considering the mean field parameter @xmath67 defined in eq.([beta ] ) .",
    "whereas for extended systems this parameter is exactly zero @xcite , for a sqd it becomes a function of the confinement energies @xmath83 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath84 is depicted in fig .",
    "we consider a constant relationship between electron and hole confinement lengths , i.e , @xmath85 .",
    "it can be seen that in the limit of small confinement , @xmath86 pure two - dimensional systems ( @xmath87=0 ) , @xmath67 tends to zero , as it should be .",
    "this means that the usual condition of ( @xmath88 ) for the carriers coulomb interaction in extended systems is broken in confined systems .",
    "we have tested our results taking a huge set of excitonic states and we found that higher energy states give a negligible contribution to @xmath67 .",
    "the phase - dynamics and the non - linear optical signal are calculated for different decay rates . in order to better clarify , why mfa is not adequate to describe non - linear optical signals at small times , we plot in fig .",
    "2 , separately , the amount of particle correlation contribution to the fwm signal as described within mfa ( eq.[meanfield ] ) and exact x - x effects ( eq.[xx ] ) , which include memory ( non - markovian ) effects , for @xmath89 mev .",
    "the usual and simplest approximation for this last term yields to the markov approximation and mfa results .",
    "by contrast , in this work we have performed a full numerical evaluation of x - x effects by summing over all biexciton states .",
    "hence , we plot the absolute values of both , the real part of @xmath90 ( mfa term ) and the real part of @xmath91 ( x - x term ) .",
    "the mfa result grows monotonically with @xmath92 , whereas the x - x result shows beating oscillations with a period corresponding to @xmath93 , the biexciton binding energy . as can be seen ,",
    "non - markovian effects arising from exciton - exciton correlations are the main source of discrepancies between mfa results and the exact ones .",
    "this means that ultrafast spectroscopy in sqds should register memory effects associated to four particle correlations .    in the inset of fig .",
    "2 , we show the spectral weight @xmath94 as a function of biexciton energy levels ( the zero of energy corresponds to twice the single @xmath37-heavy - exciton energy ) . we have only plotted those levels that have total angular momentum @xmath95 . the bound biexciton level is clearly seen at negative energies .",
    "although , unbound biexciton states have non - negligible spectral weights the bound biexciton still has a comparable weight . as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 mfa fails to describe properly four particle interactions at very short times , where particle - particle correlations are important .",
    "this term does not oscillates and only average the exact result .",
    "besides that , the contribution in eq.[xx ] , takes into account a higher degree of correlation going beyond mf and gives oscillations at very short times .",
    "this oscillations provide information about strong correlations between excitons . thus , the bound biexciton dynamics is directly linked to non - markovian effects .",
    "by contrast , in the long time limit ( @xmath96 ) , memory effects are lost and mfa results approach to the real part of the first term in eq.[xx ] . the fwm signal becomes dominated by non - radiative dephasing effects , producing in this way a simple exponential decay .    in order to assess",
    "how the main features described above are reflected on the optical dynamical characteristics , we plot the non - linear fwm intensity @xmath97 in figs . 3(a ) and 3(c ) , and the dynamical phase @xmath98 in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 3(d ) , for dephasing rates , @xmath990.125 mev and 0.5 mev , respectively . to better illustrate the results ,",
    "a comparison is made between mfa and x - x results on the same plots .",
    "for a low dephasing rate ( @xmath10 8 ps ) , strong oscillations are clearly seen in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) for @xmath100 .",
    "the x - x interaction , induces a @xmath101 phase shift with respect to the incident electric field .",
    "the phase of the @xmath7 signal oscillates during a typical time @xmath9 .",
    "fwm signal shows a strong peak at @xmath102 whereas it should have a maximum at @xmath103 from mfa . for high dephasing rates ( @xmath10 2 ps ) , figs .",
    "3(c ) and ( d ) , the attenuation of both the intensity and phase of the third order optical signal is evident .",
    "at this time scale , the @xmath9 dephasing time is shorter than the time for which coherent effects could be seen .",
    "it is worthnoting that while the phase shows a similar starting behaviour as compared with the low dephasing case , the fwm signal intensity is drastically reduced by roughly a factor of five ( notice the change of vertical scale ) .",
    "most importantly , the phase dynamics exhibits novel features at small times when exciton - exciton correlations are considered .",
    "by contrast , mfa results yield to a real @xmath7 for any time .",
    "therefore , no phase dynamics is observed within mfa . in particular ,",
    "x - x effects present a correlation between the first fwm signal minimum and a @xmath101 jump in its phase . for long times",
    "the phase goes to a constant value . however , after the extinction of the fwm intensity , there is no longer a clear physical meaning for this phase .",
    "hence , oscillations in the phase dynamics , with a beating frequency controlled by the biexciton binding energy , could bring important information about exciton correlations in sqds .",
    "in contrast with higher dimensional systems ( quantum wells and bulk samples ) , a sqd provides us with an adequate system where exciton and biexciton discrete energy spectra can be tailored by changing the confinement potential . in this way",
    ", optimal conditions to enhance phase memory could be explored .",
    "in summary , we have studied the non - linear optical response from multiexciton complexes in a sqd . for cross - polarized excitation ,",
    "the creation of bound biexcitons is possible .",
    "they dominate the non - linear polarization dynamics in the low density regime .",
    "the phase dynamics and the fwm signal in the ultrafast scale of time have been obtained . by including all the numerically determined biexciton states , exact exciton - exciton correlations are evaluated allowing to go beyond simple mfa results . in particular we found that the phase dynamics and the fwm intensity oscillate with a period which coincides with the inverse of bound biexciton frequency .",
    "we demonstrated clearly that the usual mean field theory , which is closely related to the markovian approximation , does not describe correctly exciton correlations at very small times .",
    "however , our results show that at long times , mfa results for both intensity and phase dynamics , are close to those produced by a more realistic calculation .",
