    "these features which are similar to what was first observed in fixed target p+a experiments at @xmath93 gev could be explained ( c. 1976 ) by a simple model , the wounded nucleon model ( wnm )  @xcite . from relativity and quantum mechanics",
    "the only thing that can happen to a relativistic nucleon when it interacts with another nucleon in a nucleus is to become an excited nucleon with the same energy but reduced longitudinal momentum ( rapidity ) .",
    "it remains in that state inside the nucleus because the uncertainty principle and time dilation prevent it from fragmenting into particles until it is well outside the nucleus . if one makes the further assumptions that an excited nucleon interacts with the same cross section as an unexcited nucleon and that the successive collisions of the excited nucleon do not affect the excited state or its eventual fragmentation products , this leads to the conclusion that the elementary process for particle production in nuclear collisions is the excited nucleon , and to the prediction that the multiplicity in nuclear interactions should be proportional to the total number of projectile and target participants ( wounded nucleons )  @xcite , rather than to the total number of collisions .",

    "the fact that the scaled evolution with centrality is the same from @xmath102 gev to 2.76 tev indicates that the dominant effect is the nuclear geometry of the a+a collision .",

    "the aqm is actually a model of particle production by color - strings in which only one color - string can be attached to a constituent - quark participant .",
    "thus , for asymmetric systems such as d+au , the maximum number of color - strings is limited to the number of constituent - quarks in the lighter nucleus , or six for d+au , while the nqp allows all the quark participants in both nuclei to emit particles . a new phenix measurement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nqp]b )  @xcite shows that the nqp model gives the correct @xmath40 distribution in d+au , while the aqm has a factor of 1.7 less @xmath40 emission due to the restriction on the number of effective constituent - quarks in the larger nucleus .",

    "<S> highlights from brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and experiments at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) are presented for the years 20112013 . </S>",
    "<S> this review is a combination of lectures which discussed the latest results each year at a three year celebration of the 50th anniversary of the international school of subnuclear physics in erice , sicily , italy . since the first collisions in the year 2000 </S>",
    "<S> , rhic has provided nucleus - nucleus and polarized proton - proton collisions over a range of nucleon - nucleon c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energies ( ) from 7.7 to 510 gev with nuclei from deuterium to uranium , most often gold . </S>",
    "<S> the objective was the discovery of the quark gluon plasma , which was achieved , and the measurement of its properties , which were much different than expected , namely a ` perfect fluid ' of quarks and gluons with their color charges exposed rather than a gas . </S>",
    "<S> topics including quenching of light and heavy quarks at large transverse momentum , thermal photons , search for a  critical point as well as measurements of collective flow , two - particle correlations and @xmath0 suppression are presented . during this period , </S>",
    "<S> results from the first and subsequent heavy ion measurements at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern became available . </S>",
    "<S> these confirmed and extended the rhic discoveries and have led to ideas for new and improved measurements . </S>",
    "<S> + _ keywords : _ rhic ; lhc ; s ; heavy ion collisions ; jet quenching ; thermal radiation ; collective flow ;  critical point ; cumulants ; @xmath0 suppression ; deconfinement . + </S>",
