    "the function @xmath1 is defined for a nonimaginary complex number @xmath2 as the nearest square root of unity . let @xmath3 be a matrix having no purely imaginary eigenvalues . since @xmath4 is analytic at the eigenvalues of @xmath3 , matrix function theory @xcite allows one to define @xmath5 .",
    "the matrix sign function is less trivial than its scalar counterpart , for instance it is not locally constant , and it has important applications , either direct like the solution of algebraic riccati equations @xcite and the treatment of certain quantum chromodynamics models @xcite or indirect as a basis to compute other important matrix functions like the matrix square root , the polar decomposition of a matrix and the geometric mean of two positive definite matrices @xcite .",
    "a common way to compute the matrix sign function is through rational iterations of the form @xmath6 , for some rational function @xmath7 having attractive fixed points at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , since any such iteration converges locally to the function @xmath10 .",
    "the prototypical example is newton s method for @xmath11 , but many other iterations have been proposed . among them , a very popular family is obtained by using the pad approximants to @xmath12 and the following characterization @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "let the @xmath15 pad approximant to @xmath16 be @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the iteration @xmath19 has been proved to be locally convergent to @xmath8 and @xmath9 with order of convergence @xmath20 for @xmath21 @xcite . the notation @xmath22 introduced here highlights the fact that the numerator and denominator of @xmath22 have degree @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we recall that , for integers @xmath25 , the @xmath15 pad approximant to a function @xmath26 is a rational function @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are polynomials of degree @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , such that @xmath32 for an introduction to the pad approximation see the book  @xcite .",
    "the iterations   have been derived by kenney and laub @xcite and are called _",
    "pad family of iterations _ or just _ pad iterations _ ; they have been considered also in @xcite for computing matrix functions or invariant subspaces of a matrix .",
    "observe that the definition of pad iterations in @xcite is slightly different from ours , since we exclude the case @xmath33 , which yields the trivial iteration @xmath34 being not locally convergent to @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "using the identity @xmath35 and the pad approximants to @xmath36 , a different family of iterations having attractive fixed points at @xmath8 and @xmath9 is obtained .",
    "if @xmath27 is the @xmath15 pad approximant to the function @xmath26 and @xmath37 , then @xmath38 is the @xmath39 approximant to @xmath40 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.5.1 ) ) , thus the @xmath15 pad approximant to @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "the iteration @xmath43 is obtained .",
    "we call the iterations or _ reciprocal pad family_. the possibility to invert the functions defining the pad iterations is suggested as well by laub in @xcite without further discussions .",
    "many iterations of interest can be retrieved in the pad family and its reciprocal : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 give newton s method , the newton - schulz iteration and halley s method for @xmath11 , respectively . among the pad family , the most common iterations",
    "are those with constant denominator ( i.e. , @xmath47 in ) , and the so - called _ principal _ pad iterations , namely , those for which the degrees of the numerator and denominator differ by 1 ( i.e. , @xmath48 or @xmath49 in ) .",
    "similarly , the reciprocal pad family contains iterations with constant numerator ( @xmath50 in ) or for which the degrees of the numerator and denominator differ by 1 ( @xmath48 or @xmath51 in ) .    prior to kenney and laub ,",
    "the pad iterations for @xmath49 and the reciprocal pad iterations for @xmath48 have been derived in a different way by howland @xcite ; iannazzo @xcite proved that the same iterations obtained by howland can be retrieved in the family of root - finding algorithms sometimes called knig family @xcite or basic family @xcite and attributed @xcite to a paper written by schrder in 1870 @xcite .",
    "the pad family and its reciprocal family are just two of the infinite families of rational iterations having the square roots of unity as attractive fixed points . a rationale for their use can be given by their interesting properties ( see @xcite for the case of the pad family ; some analogous properties hold for the reciprocal pad family ) .",
    "we show that they also have an optimality property : among all rational iterations having order of local convergence @xmath0 at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , they are the unique iterations such that the sum of the degrees of the numerator and denominator is minimal .",
    "this is a highly desirable property in terms of computational efficiency : in the _ generic _ case it is cheaper ( in terms of the number of arithmetic operations required ) to evaluate @xmath52 than @xmath53 when @xmath54 and horner s scheme is applied .",
    "let @xmath55 be nonnegative integers such that @xmath0 and @xmath56 .",
    "observe that , letting @xmath57 vary , the family @xmath58 is the union of the pad family and its reciprocal family ; the parities of @xmath30 and @xmath31 distinguish one from the other .",

    "we consider just the case @xmath0 for two reasons : first , in matrix functions computation , algorithms based on rational iterations are competitive if they converge fast , that is if they are of order at least @xmath69 ; second , if @xmath70 a direct computation shows that the unique iterations satisfying * o1 * and * o2 * are the same as the ones obtained for @xmath71 .",
    "it is worth noting that a rational iteration satisfying * o1 * and * o2 * for some @xmath0 is not necessarily the one whose iteration function can be evaluated with the minimal cost . in principle , there can be a special rational function which does not satisfy * o2 * and can be evaluated with fewer arithmetic operations .",
    "in addition , the same iteration can be evalutated with many different schemes yielding different computational costs , relevant in the matrix case ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) ) . for the principal pad iterations , a partial fraction expansion @xcite and a continued fraction expansion",
