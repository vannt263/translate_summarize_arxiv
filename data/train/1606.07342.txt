    "living matter exhibits a broad spectrum of unique phenomena which emerge as a consequence of its active constituents .",

    "the assumption of a spherical shape is adequate for swimmers like _ volvox _ , however , the shape of bacteria such as _ e. coli _ or the time - averaged shape of cells such as _ chlamydomonas _ is nonspherical .",
    "hence , an extension of the squirmer concept to spheroidal objects is desirable . in 1977 ,",
    "keller and wu proposed a generalization of the squirmer model to a prolate - spheroidal shape , which resembles real biological microswimmers such as _ tetrahymenapyriformis _ , _ spirostomum ambiguum _ , and _ paramecium multimicronucleatum _ @xcite .",
