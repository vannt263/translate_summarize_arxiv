    "acoustic - gravity wave is basically an acoustic wave with low frequency which can not be detected by humans directly .",
    "so , it can be measured with a technique having lower and higher cut - off frequencies .",
    "usually , acoustic modes have higher cut - off frequency and gravity modes have lower cut - off frequency . in other words",
    ", we can say acoustic waves propagating in the presence of earth s gravitational field for our future discussions in this paper . during the year 1960 and 1980 s number of meteor - fireball ( large bodies ) entered into the earth s atmosphere creating numerous blast waves during their drag interaction with the air [ 35].a century before h.lamb [ 34 ] worked out the cut - off frequency for linear acoustic waves propagating in isothermal and stratified medium , which was called as isothermal atmosphere .",
    "the cut - off frequency is basically defined as the ratio of sound speed to twice of its density displacement [ 34 ] . since",
    ", lamb [ 1 ] had also worked on non - isothermal medium he has obtained the corresponding cut - off frequency formula analytically . even though there are many ways to understand lamb s work . in this paper",
    "we have chosen to work with the analytical solutions of acoustic waves [ 4,6 - 8,16,17].according , to lamb the propagating acoustic waves excite atmospheric oscillations with the frequency equal to the natural frequency of the atmosphere [ 1,3,18].so , this phenomenon can be applied to various stellar and also planetary atmospheres .",
    "therefore , on the basis of the result of local cut - off frequency , the required cut - off frequency for earth s troposphere and stratosphere are derived and is compared with lamb s solutions graphically .",
    "these results are obtained with the help of isa ( international standard atmosphere ) model [ 36,37 ] .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 .",
    "acoustic waves derived from basic hydrodynamic equations , section 3 .",
    "derivation of local cut - off frequency , section 4 . analytically derivation of earth s troposphere , and section 5 .",
    "analytically derivation of earth s stratosphere .",
    "let us consider the 1-d atmospheric model with gradients of density , temperature and pressure along the z - axis . in terms of basic 1-d hydrodynamic equations [ 34 ] ,",
    "propagation of linear and adiabatic acoustic waves are described and is given by , @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the perturbed velocity , pressure and density respectively . also , @xmath6 is gravity , @xmath7 is the speed of sound , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the background gas density and pressure respectively .",

    "now the critical frequencies in terms of @xmath20 is given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the original lamb acoustic cutoff frequency and @xmath57 .",
    "+ remember the isothermal atmosphere of both the critical frequencies can be reduce to lamb s cutoff @xmath58 .    using the fourier",
    "transform in time and applying the oscillation to turning - point theorems ( musielak et al .",
    "2006 ; routh et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 , 2013 ) we get the following turning - point frequencies @xmath59 the turning - point frequencies have two separate solutions one is propagating and the other is non - propagating ( evanescent ) waves .",
    "however , there is a turning - point frequency for each wave variable , only one of them can be the cutoff frequency .",
    "so , we follow musielak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and routh et .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) , and identify the largest turning - point frequency as the cutoff frequency .",
    "( i.e , to check whether @xmath60 or vice versa )    by using similar conversion for the turning - point frequencies @xmath61 and @xmath62 + we get , @xmath63^{-2}\\ ,        \\label{siiieq18}\\ ] ] and the cutoff frequency given by @xmath64\\ .",
