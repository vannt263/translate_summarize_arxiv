    "this morphology , seen on a parsec scale within the milky way , earned them their nickname .  and  are the brightest persistent sources in the galactic bulge above @xmath550  kev @xcite .",
    "their timing characteristics are typical of the black hole low / hard state @xcite , and they consistently emit near their brightest observed levels , although they vary over times of days to years .",
    "their  emission properties are readily likened to the canonical bhc , cyg  x-1 .",
    "in fact , together with cyg  x-1 , they are the only known persistent , low - state bhcs , and all three sources have maximum luminosities around @xmath6ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "radio jets have now been observed in cyg  x-1 , furthering the similarity @xcite .    and  are , however , quite different from the galactic _ superluminal _ radio sources more typically thought of as micro - quasars : grs  1915 + 105 and gro  j1655 - 40 .",
    "the  emission from these objects is much brighter and more spectacularly variable .",
    "their radio jets , too , are much brighter and are highly variable , being unresolved or absent except during exceptional ejection events which last only weeks . in contrast , the radio lobes of  and are quite stable @xcite .",

    "during more than 5 years monitoring with the _ rxte _  prior to 2001 march , the  hard  spectrum was always dominated by a hard power law with photon index @xmath8 @xcite with occasional appearance of a weak thermal component @xcite . as shown in figure  [ f_lc ] ,  made an abrupt state change in 2001 march .",
    "the hard flux dropped by an order of magnitude in a few days , leaving the thermal component seen in figure  [ f_spec ] .",
    "based on relative luminosity , however , the current soft state is not a _ high_/soft state . rather it is significantly less luminous than the low / hard state in this source .",
    "this can be contrasted to cyg  x-1 and the soft  transients , where the _",
    "high_/soft state is more luminous .",
    "rather , this seems to be a low - luminosity state which is fading into quiescence ( figure  [ f_lc ] ) . finally , we note that the measured column density is consistent with previous measurements @xcite    since strong jet ejections are generally associated with the `` very high state '' and transitions from the `` off '' to high / soft states in  transients @xcite , it is perhaps not surprising that no jet emission appeared in our low / hard state observations ( sep - oct 2000 ) and the recent transition observation ( mar 2001 ) .",
    "perhaps our best opportunity will come when ( if ? )  makes a transition once again to its normal , low / hard state .",
