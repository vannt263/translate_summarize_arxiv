    "astronomical observations have led to a consensus that the energy make - up of the visible universe is approximately @xmath3 dark energy ( de ) , @xmath4 dark matter ( dm ) and @xmath5 normal matter @xcite .",
    "while de apparently represents a vacuum energy , the physical nature of dm remains mysterious @xcite .",
    "up to the present time the most popular theories of dm have been that it consists of either weakly interacting elementary particles with a mass between 1 gev and 1 tev ( wimps ) or very weakly interacting invisible axions @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis that dm consists of wimps is plausible in the sense that the existence of wimp - like particles is expected in any fundamental theory of elementary particles that possesses a supersymmetry between bosons and fermions .",
    "supersymmetry gives rise to an r - parity which is needed to prevent unobserved proton decay and gave rise to the expectation that a light r=-1 particle , the neutralino , is the wimp responsible for dm .",
    "unfortunately , all attempts to identify dm wimps have so far failed .",
    "most notably at the cern lhc , where supersymmetry was widely expected to make an appearance if dark matter consists of wimps , there is no sign of any wimp ; the best limits on wimp detection are from liquid xenon detectors including lux @xcite and panda - x @xcite .",
    "apparently supersymmetry is broken at an energy scale not accessible to the lhc @xcite .",
    "another type of elementary particle that has been much discussed as a candidate for dm is the invisible axion , with a mass @xmath6 ev .",
    "because it appeared that it might be possible to detect a dark matter density of invisible axions using their signature conversion to 2 photons in a strong magnetic field , clever experiments were initiated to search for dm axions .",
    "however , to date no evidence for invisible axions has appeared , although it should be emphasized that only a modest fraction of the allowed mass range has been scanned .",
    "taken together with basic theoretical questions about the axion idea ,",
    "a reasonable conclusion at this time is that alternatives to elementary particle models for dm should be seriously considered @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the alternative idea that dm consists of massive primordial compact objects in the form of either black holes @xcite , gravastars @xcite , or dark energy stars @xcite .    the first dedicated searches for dark matter massive compact objects within our galaxy ( machos ) , carried out in the 1990 s @xcite , used the gravitational microlensing technique , so - called because of the very small angular sizes of the lenses as seen from the earth , first suggested by paczynski @xcite and griest @xcite .",
    "although a number of microlensing events were recorded , the observed number of such events could not account for the total density dark matter known to exist in the milky way .",
    "the original macho search looked for events with durations ranging between about two hours and two hundred days , corresponding to macho masses between approximately @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there is no fundamental reason why the technique of looking for gravitational microlensing used in the original @xcite and subsequent macho searches @xcite can not be extended to higher mass machos .",
    "machos were originally conceived of as the end products of stellar evolution , i.e. white dwarfs , neutron stars , black holes ,  or possibly brown dwarfs  and as a result of this prejudice it was not expected that macho masses would exceed @xmath9 , corresponding to the mass of a black hole formed by the collapse of the core of a very massive star whose nuclear fuel has been exhausted . on the other hand",
    "it was suggested many years ago by one of us @xcite that dm might consist of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) .",
    "although it was initially thought that these pbhs would typically have masses much smaller than the mass of the sun @xcite , theoretical arguments have been advanced @xcite that pbhs with masses @xmath10 might have been prolifically produced at the onset of the big bang .",
    "indeed there are cosmological models where primordial production of a dm density of either pbhs @xcite or dark energy stars @xcite with masses @xmath10 is favored .",
    "we will continue to use the acronym macho for these objects because for masses @xmath11 such objects can contribute to the dark matter halo of our galaxy . in the following",
    "we will use the acronym i m macho to denote machos with masses in the range    @xmath12    i.e. intermediate between the masses of black holes formed as a result of stellar evolution and the supermassive compact objects found at the centers of galaxies .",
    "although the 1990s search concluded that number of galactic machos with masses @xmath13 was insufficient to explain the density of dm in our galaxy , we believe that the time is ripe to reconsider the idea that dark matter consists of machos , particularly in the mass range ( 1 ) . it might be noted that the recent ligo detection of gravitational radiation from coalescing @xmath14 black holes is entirely consistent with the hypothesis that dm is made up of objects in this mass range @xcite . in section 2",
    "we will consider the question whether there are other astrophysical observations that bear on whether dm consists of i m machos .",
    "our general conclusion is that the question as to whether dm consists of i m machos is best settled by using gravitational micro - lensing to limit the density of i m machos in our galaxy .",
    "our main objective in this paper is to point out how the microlensing search techniques used in previous macho searches might be extended to definitively test over the next several years the hypothesis that the dm mass density is dominated by machos with masses in the range in eq.(1 ) .",
    "our strategy for directly detecting these machos , discussed in more detail in section 3 is to search for a transient brightening of stars beyond our galaxy that is consistent with gravitational micro - lensing , and then follow these candidate microlensing events over a period of a year or more to observe the parallax effect of the earth s motion on the microlensing . in section 3",
    "we comment on how well this type of observing program maps onto the capabilities of astronomical resources that are available either currently or in the immediate future .",
    "a well known theoretical argument that dm can not consist of i m machos with masses in the range eq.(1 ) hinges on the consequences of accretion of interstellar gas onto a dm density of primordial machos just after the time when electrons and nuclei in the interstellar gas recombine to form atoms@xmath15 .",
    "the x - rays emitted by the accretion of this interstellar gas onto a dm population would heat the interstellar gas , which in turn would cause via the inverse compton effect a distortion in the cmb both with regard to its spectrum and isotropy . a widely cited attempt to calculate this effect [ 23 ] employed the bondi - hoyle model for spherical accretion onto black holes , and carries through the computation all the way up to a point of comparison with limits on cmb spectral distortions derived from the cobe satellite observations . in particular it is claimed in @xcite that the observed limits on the cmb distortion constrain the density of massive pbhs to only a tiny fraction @xmath16 of the dm density .",
    "however the bondi - hoyle model for accretion ignores angular momentum conservation .",
    "although this may be a good approximation before recombination when the angular momentum of accreting matter is rapidly dissipated by compton viscosity @xcite , it becomes a questionable approximation after @xmath17 when the dm mass - energy density is already much larger than that of the cmb .",
    "indeed it is well known @xcite that in the observable universe the bondi - hoyle model fails badly as a model for accretion onto the super - massive compact objects at the centers of galaxies - which in fact could themselves be primordial in origin .",
    "it was also noted in @xcite that the limits on the contribution of massive pbhs to dm is sensitive to the fraction of time that the accretion onto the black hole is interrupted due to the eddington limit for accretion .",
    "however if the i m macho is a dark energy star rather than a black hole , the intermittency of the accretion onto the primordial machos would be significantly increased due to a dramatic lowering of the accretion rate where the eddington limit is reached .",
    "it has also been suggested that the existence of binary stars with wide separations might exclude @xcite the existence of a dm density of i m machos ; however , the argument is indirect , and at the present time it is uncertain whether the observed abundance of wide binaries is inconsistent with a dm density of i m machos @xcite .",
    "one argument that can be interpreted to be supportive of the hypothesis that dm does consist of i m machos is that numerical simulations @xcite of the spontaneous formation of inhomogeneous dm cosmic structures after @xmath18 , which typically use as a model for dm point - like masses with masses in range @xmath19 , reproduce quite nicely the observed inhomogeneous structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "of course , the masses used in these simulations were not chosen for any fundamental reason but for computational convenience .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that these numerical simulations provide a good account for observed large scale cosmic structures provides a kind of existence proof that at least in first approximation i m machos can explain dm .",
    "it is also worth noting that when the dm gravitational dynamics simulations are amended by adding gas dynamics the observed morphologies of galaxies can be explained if the @xmath20 point masses are supplemented with @xmath21 point masses @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the supermassive compact objects at the centers of galaxies may be primordial in origin .",
    "it might also be mentioned that there are theoretical arguments based on observed entropy of the universe @xcite that dm should consist of massive compact objects .",
    "we are interested in the gravitational lensing of stars just outside our galaxy ( e.g. in the magellanic clouds ) by i m machos within our galaxy .",
    "the possible use of gravitational microlensing to search for machos with masses much higher than @xmath22 , was first discussed in detail by gould @xcite . from the perspective of an earth observer the microlensing event sought in these searches",
    "is simply described as a characteristic transient brightening of the source star , where the time dependence arises from the motion of the lens relative to the observer s line of sight to the source .",
    "some brightness amplification curves for some selected values of the projected distance of the passing macho from the star being imaged are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the x - axis in fig.1 is the einstein ring crossing time @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the radius of the einstein ring and v is the macho velocity perpendicular to the line of sight to the star , which for a macho in the galactic halo can be approximated as the virial velocity for the halo ; i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "d is related to the distance to the star ds and distance from the earth to the microlensing object @xmath26 ( l = lens ) by @xmath27 . for sources in the magellanic clouds",
    "d would typically be @xmath28 kpc .",
    "this tells us that the duration of the microlensing brightening will be on the order @xmath29 years , so for @xmath30 one would have @xmath31 .",
    "since the maximum practical duration of a survey is perhaps 10 years , the first challenge to be faced by our proposal is that many of the events we are interested in may have traversed only a fraction of their full light curve during the survey time .",
    "a pertinent question is how many micro - lensing events could one hope to detect during a survey of say @xmath32 years duration ?",
    "the number of microlensing events in progress at any time , defined as those with a source inside the einstein ring of the lens , is given by @xmath33 where n is the number of lmc sources stars being monitored and @xmath34 is the micro - lensing optical depth .",
    "@xmath34 is independent of m , depending only on the structure of the galaxy and the assumption that the dark matter which determines its kinematics consists of machos .",
    "a value of @xmath35 is a reasonable estimate for the optical depth to the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "determining n is more difficult , since it depends not only on the actual number of stars in the survey are to some limiting magnitude , but also on the capabilities of the algorithms to identify individual stars . as reference points , the macho survey @xcite monitored @xmath36 stars in the central region of the lmc while the ogle survey @xcite monitored @xmath37 stars in both magellanic clouds .",
    "both surveys monitored stars brighter than visual magnitude 20.5 , a limit which misses the bulk of the magellanic cloud s main sequence stars . with the 4 meter blanco telescope one could probably reach @xmath38 mag , while with the 8 meter lsst one could do even better , going to at least @xmath39 mag . if we assume that we can resolve all the stars in the magellanic clouds down to @xmath39 mag , then conservatively @xmath40 could yield @xmath41 .",
    "this task will be challenging , given that for i m machos near to the top of the mass range ( 1 ) the stellar brightness will vary over the survey duration by amounts which are comparable to the photometric errors ( for the lsst : 0.001mag up to v=20mag ; 0.1mag up to v=24.5mag ) , and that there will be other sources of stellar variability , both due to astrophysical effects and systematic errors in photometry .",
    "for the purposes of eliminating spurious variations in stellar brightening , the previously used technique of looking for achromatic variation will still be useful .",
    "one advantage of monitoring a candidate micro - lensing event over a period longer than 1 year though is that this provides an opportunity to use the motion of the earth around the sun .",
    "as first suggested by gould @xcite it is possible to the parallax effect of the earth s motion on the microlens brightening curve to not only distinguish microlensing from intrinsic brightening , but also say quite a bit about the phase space density of machos .",
    "2 shows the effect of the earth s motion on the micro - lensing magnification curve as a function of macho mass .",
    "this parallax effect , first observed by the macho collaboration in @xcite , would allow one to distinguish microlensing brightening from intrinsic stellar variability or background sources ( e.g. variable stars , supernova , etc . ) that may exhibit brightening but no parallactic variability . in figs . 2 and 3",
    "we show how the parallax effect depends on macho galactic velocity and distance to the macho",
    ". such information would be invaluable for confirming that the micro - lensing machos have the properties expected if they are responsible for the dm halo of our galaxy .",
    "further details about the parallax effect are provided in @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested by gould@xcite that the masses of the microlensing objects can in principle also be estimated by directly observing the einstein ring .",
    "as candidates are identified , their compact nature can in principle be unambiguously determined using adaptive optics imaging from the ground . for masses between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the angular size of the einstein ring is @xmath44 arcsec .",
    "this is comparable with the demonstrated @xmath45 arcsec angular resolution of southern hemisphere magellan adaptive optics system , so direct imaging of the einstein ring for the most massive i m machos may already be a possibility .",
    "however , direct imaging of the einstein ring over the full mass range ( 1 ) will probably have to wait until first light for the thirty meter or giant magellan telescopes .        of course",
    ", in order to identify an incipient microlensing event the brightness of each individual star with must be recorded with sufficient accuracy with each exposure to determine if the star has brightened in a manner consistent with micro - lensing .",
    "this accuracy will be limited by the duration of each exposure and how often the exposure is made ; i.e. the `` cadence '' . among existing astronomical facilities , the blanco dark energy camera in chile may be the best candidate for achieving the @xmath46 level of photometry accuracy that would needed to identify i m macho candidates in the next few years .",
    "the lsst , which is expected to be able to measure stellar brightness with an accuracy of @xmath47 magnitude down to its limiting magnitude @xmath39 , would almost certainly be capable of identifying i m macho candidates after it becomes available as a user facility . using the lsst to cover the magellanic clouds",
    ", we estimate that a @xmath48 second exposure every 2 weeks ought to suffice to produce @xmath49 microlensing candidates over a period of @xmath50 years after first light if dm does indeed consist of i m machos .",
    "as noted in our introduction the recent lhc results have cast doubt on the hypothesis that dm consists of wimps , and have refocused attention on the idea that primordial machos may be responsible for dm . while there is some possibility that a dm density of machos could be discerned in the statistics of gravitationally bound structures or an inhomogeneity of the cosmic microwave background , methods based on the gravitational lensing of light",
    "offer a more direct approach to determining whether for dm consists of massive machos .",
    "although it may be possible to detect immachos using existing instruments such as blanco decam and magellanic ao system , the lsst when it comes online circa 2022 will provide a definitive capability for rapidly detecting and determining the mass spectrum of the dm machos , if they exist .",
    "we are grateful to tim axelrod for many helpful discussions .",
    "in particular we are grateful to tim axelrod for pointing the possibility of using the magellan ao system to detect the einstein rings of i m machos .",
    "we would also like to thank william dawson for pointing out the signature characteristics of the parallax effect for immachos and help with preparing the figures .",
