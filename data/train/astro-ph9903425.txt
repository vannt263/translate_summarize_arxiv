    "explaining the origin and evolution of galaxies and large - scale structure and determining the fundamental properties of the background universe are the primary goals of modern cosmology .",
    "the most common assumption is that the structure we observe today ( density structures such as galaxies , clusters , and voids , as well as velocity structures such as the virgocentric infall or that associated with the great attractor ) , results from the growth , by gravitational instability , of small - amplitude , primordial density fluctuations present in the universe at early times .",
    "these fluctuations are normally assumed to originate from a gaussian random process . in this case",
    ", they can be described as a superposition of plane - wave density fluctuations with random phases .",
    "one important property of these initial conditions is that overdense and underdense regions occupy equal volumes ( in other words , their filling factors are 1/2 ) .",
    "since the density is nearly uniform at early times , overdense and underdense regions also contain the same mass .",
    "the gravitational instability scenario makes the following predictions : overdense regions , because of their larger gravitational field , will decelerate faster than the background universe , resulting in an increase of their density contrast relative to the background . if this deceleration is large enough , these regions will turn back and recollapse on themselves , resulting in the formation of positive density structures such as galaxies and clusters .",
    "the opposite phenomenon occurs in underdense regions .",
    "these regions decelerate more slowly than the background universe , thus getting more underdense , and eventually become the cosmic voids we observe today .    in this paper , we investigate the asymptotic collapsed fraction , defined as the fraction of the matter in the universe that will eventually end up inside collapsed objects .",
    "obviously , this makes sense only in an unbound universe .",
    "naively , we might think that the asymptotic collapsed fraction will be equal to 1/2 , since half the matter is located in overdense regions at early times .",
    "this ignores two important effects .",
    "first , some overdense regions might be unbound , and second , matter located inside underdense regions could be accreted by collapsed objects .",
    "the importance of these effects depends upon the particular background universe in which these structures form .",
    "consider , for instance , an einstein - de  sitter universe . in this case , the background density is exactly equal to the critical density , and therefore all overdense regions are bound , and will eventually collapse .",
    "furthermore , it can easily be shown that any mass element located inside an underdense region is gravitationally bound to at least one overdense region .",
    "consequently , all the matter inside underdense regions will eventually be accreted by collapsed objects , and the asymptotic collapsed fraction is unity .",
    "this is not true , however , for a background universe with mean density below that of an einstein - de  sitter universe .",
    "interest in models of the background universe in which the matter density is less than the critical value for a flat , matter - dominated universe is now particularly strong , on the basis of several lines of evidence which can be reconciled most economically if @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the present mean matter density in units of the critical value .",
    "( for reviews and references , see , e.g. , ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ; turner 1998 ; krauss 1998 ; bahcall 1999 ) . arguments in favor of a flat universe with @xmath3 in which a nonzero cosmological constant makes up the difference between the matter density and the critical density have been significantly strengthened recently by measurements of the redshifts and distances of type ia sne , which are best explained if the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate , consistent with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the vacuum energy density in units of the critical density at present ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998a ; perlmutter et al .",
    "when combined with measurements of the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , these type ia sn results can be used to restrict further the range of models for the mass - energy content of the universe .",
    "in particular , while the sn data alone are better fit by a flat model with @xmath3 and a positive cosmological constant than by an open , matter - dominated model with no cosmological constant ( e.g. perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ) , the combined information from type ia sne and the cmb significantly strengthens the case for a flat model with cosmological constant over that for an open , matter - dominated model ( e.g. garnavich et al .",
    "exotic alternatives to the well - known cosmological constant which might also contribute positively to the total cosmic energy density and thereby similarly affect the mean expansion rate have also been discussed , sometimes referred to as `` quintessence '' models ( e.g. turner & white 1997 ; caldwell , dave , & steinhardt 1998 ) . such models can also explain the presently accelerating expansion rate indicated by the type ia sne , while satisfying several other constraints which suggest that @xmath3 .",
    "the results from type i sne and cmb anisotropy combined can be used to constrain the range of equations of state allowed for this other component of energy density @xmath8 , with pressure @xmath9 .",
    "the current results favor a flat universe with @xmath3 and an equation of state for the second component with a value of @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 for a cosmological constant ) favored over larger values of @xmath12 ( such as would describe topological defects like domain walls , strings , or textures ) , although the restriction of the range allowed for @xmath12 is not yet very precise ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "consider now an unbound universe with a matter density parameter @xmath13 with present value @xmath3 .",
    "in such a universe , the critical density exceeds the mean density , and therefore some overdense regions are unbound .",
    "the asymptotic collapsed fraction could still be unity if all the matter in overdense , unbound regions plus all the matter in underdense regions is accreted .",
    "this will never be the case , however .",
    "in such a universe , the density parameter @xmath13 is near unity at early times , and structures can grow .",
    "eventually @xmath13 drops significantly below unity , and a phenomenon known as `` freeze - out '' occurs . in this regime , density fluctuations do not grow unless their density is already significantly larger than the background density .",
    "after freeze - out , accretion by collapsed objects will be very slow , and most of the unaccreted matter will remain unaccreted . the asymptotic collapsed fraction will therefore be less than unity .",
    "the asymptotic collapsed fraction is a quantity which is relevant to modern attempts to interpret observations of cosmic structure in at least two ways .",
    "for one , anthropic reasoning can be used to calculate a probability distribution for the observed values of some fundamental property of the universe , such as the cosmological constant , in models in which that property takes a variety of values with varying probabilities ( efstathiou 1995 ; vilenkin 1995 ; weinberg 1996 ; martel , shapiro , & weinberg 1998 , hereafter msw ) .",
    "examples of such models include those in which a state vector is derived for the universe which is a superposition of terms with different values of the fundamental property ( e.g. hawking 1983 , 1984 ; coleman 1988 ) and chaotic inflation in which the observed big bang is just one of an infinite number of expanding regions in each of which the fundamental property takes a different value ( linde 1986 , 1987 , 1988 ) . in models like these",
    ", the probability of observing any particular value of the property is conditioned by the existence of observers in those `` subuniverses '' in which the property takes that value .",
    "this probability is proportional to the fraction of matter which is destined to condense out of the background into mass concentrations large enough to form observers ",
    "i.e. the asymptotic collapsed fraction for collapse into objects of this mass or greater .",
    "msw used this approach to offer a possible resolution of the infamous `` cosmological constant problem , '' one of the most serious crises of quantum cosmology .",
    "estimates of the size of a relic vacuum energy density @xmath14 from quantum fluctuations in the early universe suggest a value which is many orders of magnitude larger than the cosmic mass density today , and no cancellation mechanism has yet been identified which would reduce this to zero , let alone one so finely tuned as to leave the small but _ nonzero _ value suggested by recent astronomical observations ( i.e. where the net @xmath14 is the sum of a contribution from quantum fluctuations and a term @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the cosmological constant which appears in einstein s field equations ) ( weinberg 1989 ; carroll , press , & turner 1992 ) .",
    "msw calculated the relative likelihood of observing any given value of @xmath14 within the context of the flat cdm model with nonzero cosmological constant , with the amplitude and shape of the primordial power spectrum in accordance with current data on the cmb anisotropy .",
    "underlying this calculation was the notion that values of @xmath14 which are large are unlikely to be observed since such values of @xmath14 tend to suppress gravitational instability and prevent galaxy formation .",
    "msw found that a small , positive cosmological constant in the range suggested by astronomical evidence is actually a reasonably likely value to observe , even if the a priori probability distribution that a given subuniverse has some value of the cosmological constant does not favor such small values .",
    "similar reasoning can , in principle , be used to assess the probability of our observing some range of values for other properties of the universe , too , in the absence of a theory which uniquely determines their values ( e.g. the value of @xmath17 ; garriga , tanaka , & vilenkin 1998 ) . in such calculations ,",
    "the asymptotic collapsed fraction is a fundamental ingredient .    aside from its importance in anthropic probability calculations like these , in which one needs to know the state of the universe in the infinite future , the asymptotic collapsed fraction is also relevant as an approximation to the _ present _ universe , for the following reason . in an einstein - de  sitter universe , in which there is no freeze - out , the asymptotic collapsed fraction is unity . in any other unbound universe",
    ", there will be a freeze - out at some epoch .",
    "if we live in such a universe , the freeze - out epoch could be either in the future or in the past .",
    "however , if recent attempts to reconcile a number of the observed properties of our universe with theoretical models of the background universe and of structure formation by invoking an unbound universe with @xmath3 are correct , then the freeze - out epoch is much more likely to be in the past .",
    "if it were in the future , then the matter density parameter today would still be close to unity , e.g. @xmath18 or @xmath19 . in order to undergo gravitational collapse , where @xmath14 is the vacuum energy density and @xmath20 is the mean matter density ( weinberg 1987 ) . in this case , once @xmath20 drops to a value of the order of @xmath14 or less , only density enhancements which are already nonlinear will remain gravitationally bound . as such , the `` freeze - out '' epoch corresponds roughly to the time when @xmath21 .",
    "recent estimates from measurements of distant type ia sne , however , suggest values which , if interpreted in terms of this model , are closer to @xmath22 ( garnavich et al . 1998a ; perlmutter et al . 1998 ) , so `` freeze - out '' began in the past for this model . ]",
    "if so , then the observable consequences of the eventual departure of the background model from einstein - de  sitter would be largely in the future , as well .",
    "as such , the strong motivation for considering models with @xmath3 in order to explain a number of the observed properties of our universe as described above would vanish . in short ,",
    "the current interest in a universe with @xmath3 is consistent with a value of @xmath4 small enough that the epoch of freeze - out is largely in the past . in that case , the asymptotic collapsed fraction should be a good approximation to the _ present _ collapsed fraction .",
    "this quantity is of interest , for example , since , by combining it with the observed luminosity density of the universe , we can get a handle on the average mass - to - light ratio of the universe , and the amount of dark matter .",
    "the complementary quantity , the _ uncollapsed _ fraction , is of interest , too , since it determines the amount of matter left behind as the intergalactic medium , observable in absorption and by its possible contributions to background radiation .",
    "a knowledge of the amount of matter left uncollapsed is also necessary in order to interpret observations of gravitational lensing of distant sources by large - scale structure .",
    "in addition , as we shall see , the dependence of the asymptotic collapsed fraction on the equation of state of the background universe will imply that theoretical tools , such as the press - schechter approximation , require adjustment in order to take proper account of the effect of `` freeze - out '' on the rate of cosmic structure formation .    in this paper , we compute the asymptotic collapsed fraction for unbound universes , using an analytical model involving spherical top - hat density perturbations surrounded by shells of compensating underdensity , applied statistically to the case of gaussian random noise density fluctuations , a model introduced by msw for the particular case of a flat universe with a cosmological constant .",
    "we consider a generic cosmological model with 2 components , a nonrelativistic component whose mean energy density varies as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the frw scale factor , and a uniform , nonclumping component whose energy density varies as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is non - negative . in terms of the equations of state for these two components , we can write this as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mean energy density and pressure contributed by component @xmath30 . for the nonrelativistic matter component , @xmath31 , while for component x , @xmath32 is the physically allowed range in models in which the universe had a big bang in its past and the energy of component x was not more important in the past than that of matter , which corresponds to @xmath33 and the range @xmath34 .",
    "the latter condition is necessary in order to be consistent with observations of cosmic structure and the cmb anisotropy today .",
    "special cases of this model include models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath35 ) , domain walls ( @xmath36 ) , infinite strings ( @xmath37 ) , massive neutrinos ( @xmath38 ) , and radiation background ( @xmath39 ) ( although , as explained above , we shall exclude values of @xmath40 in our treatment here ) .",
    "this generic model , or similar ones , have been discussed previously by many authors ( e.g. fry 1985 ; charlton & turner 1987 ; silveira & waga 1994 ; martel 1995 ; dodelson , gates , & turner 1996 ; turner & white 1997 ; martel & shapiro 1998 ) . recently ,",
    "such models have been referred to as `` quintessence '' models ( e.g. caldwell , dave , & steinhardt 1998 ) or as models involving `` dark energy . ''",

    ", we derive the conditions that the cosmological parameters must satisfy in order for the background universe to qualify as an eternal , unbound universe . in  3 , we compute the critical density contrast @xmath45 , defined as the minimum density contrast a spherical perturbation must have in order to be bound . in  4 , we derive the asymptotic collapse fraction @xmath46 in an unbound universe , using the model introduced by msw involving compensated spherical top - hat density fluctuations . in  5 ,",
    "we compute @xmath46 using the press - schechter approximation , instead . in  6 , we compare the predictions of the two models .",
    "as we shall see , this comparison points up a fundamental limitation to the validity of the ad hoc , over - all correction factor of 2 by which the press - schechter integral over positive initial density fluctuations is traditionally multiplied so as to recover a total collapsed factor which takes account of the accretion of mass initially in underdense regions .",
    "in particular , we shall derive this factor of 2 for the einstein - de  sitter case , but show that the same factor of 2 in the press - schechter formula _",
    "overestimates _ the asymptotic collapsed fraction for an unbound universe . to illustrate the importance of these results for currently viable models of cosmic structure formation , we apply our model in  6 to two examples of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , with @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the open , matter - dominated model and the flat model with cosmological constant .",
    "the friedmann equation  ( 1 ) describes the time - evolution of the scale factor @xmath47 .",
    "the solutions of this equation can be grouped into four categories , according to their asymptotic behavior at late times .",
    "if the derivative @xmath48 , which is initially positive , remains positive at all times , never dropping to zero , then the universe is unbound . in the limit @xmath49",
    "can be either finite or infinite ] this is the case , for instance , in a matter - dominated universe with @xmath3 .",

    "this is the case for a matter - dominated universe with @xmath54 .",
    "however if both @xmath48 and @xmath53 are zero at @xmath52 , then the universe asymptotically approaches an equilibrium state with @xmath52 at late times .",
    "this is the case of the de  sitter universe with a positive cosmological constant , which initially expands , and asymptotically becomes an einstein static universe .    to determine in which category",
    "a particular model falls , we need to study the properties of the friedmann equation  ( 1 ) . for convenience ,",
    "we rewrite this equation as @xmath55    where @xmath56 .",

    "we now approximate the initial conditions for the whole universe as an ensemble of these compensated top - hat perturbations , with a distribution of top - hat core positive density fluctuations given by equation  ( 17 ) , and we neglect the interaction between perturbations . as discussed in msw , the value of @xmath151 corresponds to the limit in which each positive fluctuation is isolated , surrounded by an infinite volume of compensating underdensity ( at a total density infinitessimally below the mean value @xmath20 ) . for a flat universe with nonzero cosmological constant , this case",
    "was treated by weinberg ( 1996 ) .",
    "the case @xmath152 corresponds to the limit of `` no infall '' in which the additional mass associated with the compensating underdense volume @xmath145 is negligible compared with that of the initial top - hat .",
    "this case was considered for the flat universe with @xmath153 by weinberg ( 1987 ) . if @xmath154 , however , the volume occupied by every positive fluctuation is surrounded by an equal volume of compensating negative density fluctuation .",
    "this is the case most relevant to the problem at hand , involving a gaussian - random distribution of linear density fluctuations , since the latter ensures that the volumes initially occupied by positive and negative density fluctuations of equal amplitude are exactly equal .",
    "the full range of values of @xmath155 , @xmath156 , was treated by msw for the flat universe with @xmath153 , with a special focus on @xmath154 as the case corresponding to gaussian - random noise initial conditions .",
    "the insensitivity of the results for the anthropic probability calculations presented there to the value assumed for @xmath155 suggests that the relative amount of total collapsed fraction in universes with different values of @xmath14 may not be sensitive to the crudeness of the treatment of the effect of one fluctuation on another .",
    "however , we will also present results here for the full range of values of @xmath155 , while noting that the value @xmath154 is the most relevant to the case at hand of gaussian random density fluctuations .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the asymptotic collapsed fraction for the whole universe is given by @xmath157    where @xmath158 is the value of @xmath159 at time @xmath144 ( msw ) .",
    "for bound and marginally bound universes ( including , in particular , the einstein - de  sitter universe ) , @xmath160 , and equation  ( 18 ) reduces trivially to @xmath161 for all values of @xmath155 .",
    "hence , the msw model predicts that , in an einstein - de  sitter universe , all the matter will eventually end up in collapsed objects . for unbound universes , we change variables from @xmath142 to @xmath162",
    ". equation  ( 18 ) reduces to @xmath163    where @xmath164    this equation shows that the collapsed fraction @xmath46 is unity only when @xmath165 , which requires @xmath160 .",
    "however , in an unbound universe , @xmath98 is always positive .",
    "hence , according to the msw model , the collapsed fraction in an unbound universe is always less than unity .",
    "notice that the dependence upon the cosmological parameters is entirely contained in the parameter @xmath166 . for any cosmological model",
    ", we can compute @xmath158 using equation  ( 16 ) and @xmath98 using either equation  ( 13 ) or  ( 15 ) . since @xmath167 at large @xmath102 for any universe with @xmath76 , the dependence on @xmath102 cancels out in the calculation of @xmath166 , as it should : the asymptotic collapsed fraction should not depend upon the initial epoch chosen for the calculation .",
    "the size of the asymptotic collapse parameter @xmath166 determines not only how large or small the collapsed fraction is but also how important the increase of collapsed fraction is due to accretion from the surrounding underdense regions . for small values of @xmath166",
    ", the asymptotic collapsed fraction is close to unity because _ both _ the typical positive initial density fluctuation _ and _ its fair share of the matter in surrounding regions of compensating underdensity collapse out _ before _ the effects of `` freeze - out '' suppress fluctuation growth . hence , in this limit of small @xmath166 , `` freeze - out '' is unimportant and the results resemble that for an einstein - de  sitter universe . for values of @xmath168 , however , the typical collapse occurs after `` freeze - out '' has begun to limit the growth of density fluctuations .",
    "the large @xmath166 limit , in fact , is that in which only a rare , much - higher - than - average , positive density fluctuation is able to collapse out of the background before `` freeze - out '' prevents it , and very little of the compensating underdense matter condenses out along with it .",
    "for this large @xmath166 limit , equation ( 19 ) can be shown to reduce to the following simple formula ( see appendix  a ) , @xmath169",
    "in the press - schechter approximation ( press & schechter 1974 ; henceforth , `` ps '' ) , the collapsed fraction at time @xmath170 is estimated as follows : consider a spherical top - hat perturbation with an initial linear density contrast @xmath97 chosen such that this perturbation collapses precisely at time @xmath170 .",
    "the density contrast of that perturbation is infinite at time @xmath170 .",
    "however , if we estimate the density contrast at that epoch using linear perturbation theory , we obtain instead a finite value  @xmath171 , because linear theory underestimates the growth of positive fluctuations . the value of @xmath172 is usually taken to be @xmath173 , though this result is strictly correct only for the einstein - de  sitter universe ( cf .",
    "shapiro , martel , & iliev 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "a larger perturbation would collapse earlier , and linear theory would predict that its density contrast exceeds @xmath172 at time @xmath170 . to compute the collapsed fraction at time @xmath170 , we simply need to integrate over all perturbations whose density contrast predicted by linear theory would exceed @xmath172 at time @xmath170 , using the distribution given by equation  ( 17 ) . the resulting expression , after multiplication by a factor of `` 2 '' to correct for the fact that half the mass was initially in underdense regions outside the positive density fluctuations , is @xmath174    the introduction of this ad hoc correction factor of `` 2 '' in equation  ( 22 ) is based on some assumption about the amount of matter located in unbound regions , either underdense or overdense , which is destined to be _ accreted _ onto collapsed perturbations .",
    "consider , for instance , the case of an einstein - de  sitter universe at late time .",
    "the critical density contrast distinguishing a bound from an unbound density fluctuation is zero , and therefore all overdense perturbations are bound and will eventually collapse . since , for gaussian perturbations , the overdense regions initially contain only half the mass of the universe , the asymptotic collapsed fraction , without taking accretion into account , would be @xmath175 .",
    "however , it can easily be shown that in an einstein - de  sitter universe , all matter in the universe will eventually end up inside bound objects .",
    "hence , for this particular case , the proper way to handle accretion is to multiply the collapsed fraction by a factor of 2 .",
    "equation  ( 22 ) is derived by assuming that this factor of 2 is valid , not only for the asymptotic limit of the einstein - de  sitter universe , but for all universes and at all epochs .",
    "hence , the ps approximation assumes that the total mass accreted by collapsed positive density fluctuations is instantaneously equal to the total mass of these collapsed objects themselves .",
    "what is the asymptotic collapsed fraction according to this ps approximation ?",
    "we now change variables from @xmath142 to @xmath176 .",
    "equation  ( 22 ) reduces to @xmath177    where @xmath178    to compute the asymptotic collapsed fraction , @xmath179 , we need to take the limit of equations ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) as @xmath180 .",
    "consider a bound spherical perturbation , with the values of its initial density contrast @xmath97 at initial time @xmath144 chosen so that it collapses at @xmath181 .",
    "call this value of @xmath97 , @xmath182 . by definition ,",
    "the quantity @xmath172 at @xmath181 is given by @xmath183    where @xmath184 is the linear growing mode . since this spherical perturbation collapses at @xmath181 ,",
    "_ the initial density contrast @xmath182 must be equal to the critical density contrast @xmath98_. if @xmath185 was less than @xmath98 the perturbation would not collapse at all , while if it was greater , the perturbation would collapse at a finite time .",
    "we can therefore replace @xmath182 by @xmath98 in equation  ( 25 ) .",
    "finally , we notice that the quantity @xmath159 also evolves according to linear theory , @xmath186    combining these results , we get @xmath187 ^ 2 \\over2\\big[\\sigma_i\\delta_+(\\infty)/\\delta_+(t_i)\\big]^2 } = { \\delta_{i , c}^2\\over2\\sigma_i^2}=\\beta\\,,\\ ] ]    ( see eq .",
    "hence , the ps @xmath188 parameter reduces to the msw @xmath166 parameter in the limit @xmath180 .",
    "now , comparing equations  ( 19 ) and ( 23 ) , we see immediately that these equations are identical in the limit @xmath189 .",
    "notice that the product @xmath190 takes the undetermined form @xmath191 in the case of an einstein - de  sitter universe . in this case , the quantity @xmath192 is equal to @xmath193 , or 1.6865 , at all times . in the einstein - de  sitter case , @xmath194 , and equations ( 19 ) and ( 23 ) are the same for all values of @xmath155 ; the asymptotic collapsed fractions in that case are all equal to unity .    in the limit of large @xmath166 , @xmath179 in equation ( 23 ) , with @xmath188 replaced by @xmath166 , according to equation ( 27 ) , can be shown to reduce to the following simple formula ( see appendix a ) : @xmath195    a comparison of equations ( 21 ) and ( 28 ) reveals that the asymptotic collapsed fraction @xmath179 according to the ps approximation is just a factor of @xmath196 times @xmath46 according to the msw model , in the limit of large @xmath166 .",
    "our analytical result in equations ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) for the asymptotic collapsed fraction in an eternal universe can be evaluated for any background universe which satisfies the conditions given in  2 which identify it as an unbound universe .",
    "we need only specify the background universe and the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations , in order to evaluate @xmath166 . before we do this for a few illustrative cases , however , it is instructive to evaluate the asymptotic collapsed fraction @xmath46 in general as a function of @xmath166 and @xmath155 , and compare @xmath46 to the prediction of the ps approximation , @xmath179 , according to equations ( 23 ) and ( 27 ) .",
    "we have shown above that the asymptotic collapsed fraction predicted for an eternal universe by the ps approximation differs from that predicted here by the spherical model of msw ( as generalized to other background universe cases ) for @xmath154 , the value of the shape parameter appropriate for gaussian random initial density fluctuations , with the exception of the einstein - de  sitter universe , for which @xmath197 .",
    "for any eternal universe other than einstein - de  sitter , in fact , the two approaches predict the same asymptotic collapsed fraction only if @xmath152 , instead .",
    "the fact that the two approaches generally predict different asymptotic collapsed fractions for @xmath154 is not surprising , since the ps approximation never concerns itself with the fraction of matter which is inside some gravitationally bound region and is , hence , fated to collapse out , as the msw model explicitly does .",
    "instead , the ps approximation _ assumes _ that , as long as the matter is located within a region of average density which is high enough to make it collapse according to the spherical top - hat model , it will not only collapse but will also take with it an equal share of the matter outside this region which was not initially overdense .",
    "this latter assumption is not correct if the underdense matter is not all gravitationally bound to some overdense matter .",
    "what is perhaps more surprising than this disagreement between the two approaches for @xmath154 is the fact that they _ do _ agree _ for all models _ if @xmath152 .",
    "the fact that in the limit @xmath189 the msw model reduces to the asymptotic limit of the ps approximation is significant , because the two models are based on different assumptions . in the case of the ps approximation , a factor of 2",
    "is introduced to take accretion into account . in the msw model ,",
    "the limit @xmath189 corresponds to perturbations surrounded by underdense shells of negligible volume and mass . in this limit",
    ", there is essentially no accretion .",
    "however , the volume filling factor of overdense regions , which is 1/2 in the ps approximation , approaches unity in the limit @xmath189 for the msw model , resulting once again in a factor of 2 in the expression for the collapsed fraction , but for a different reason .",
    "we have computed the collapsed fraction predicted by the msw model as a function of the parameter @xmath166 , for various values of @xmath155 , by numerically evaluating equation  ( 19 ) .",

    "the point @xmath165 , @xmath161 corresponds to the einstein - de  sitter universe .",
    "as we see , all curves go through this point , indicating that the msw model predicts the correct asymptotic limit in this case , for any value of @xmath155 .",
    "the @xmath154 case is particularly important , since it is the only one which gives equal filling factors to overdense and underdense perturbations , a requirement for describing realistic gaussian random initial conditions .",
    "figure  2 shows that for finite values of @xmath155 and for @xmath200 , the asymptotic collapsed fraction @xmath46 predicted by the msw model is always less than the asymptotic collapsed fraction @xmath179 predicted by the ps approximation .",

    "however , if @xmath202 , then the filling factor of overdense regions exceeds 1/2 , indicating that the bound perturbations contain more mass in the msw model than in the ps approximation . in spite of this , we still have @xmath203 .",
    "this is caused by their different treatments of accretion .",
    "the msw model includes a detailed calculation of the amount of matter accreted by a spherical top - hat , while the ps approximation simply assumes that the accreted mass equals the initially overdense mass , for all cosmological models .",

    "<S> these background universes all have the property that matter - domination eventually gives way either to curvature - domination or domination by the positive energy density of the additional background component . </S>",
    "<S> when this happens , gravitational instability is suppressed and , with it , so is the growth of the collapsed fraction .    our results serve to identify a limitation of the well - known press - schechter approximation for the time - dependent mass function of cosmological structure formation . in the latter approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the mass function determined from the predicted collapse of positive density fluctuations is multiplied by an ad hoc correction factor of 2 based upon an assumption that every positive density fluctuation which is fated to collapse will simultaneously accrete an equal share of additional matter from nearby regions of compensating negative density fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> the model presented here explicitly determines the actual value of the factor by which any positive density fluctuation which ever collapses will asymptotically increase its mass by accreting from a compensating underdensity which surrounds it . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , while the famous factor of 2 adopted by the press - schechter approximation is correct for an einstein - de  sitter universe , it is not correct when the `` freeze - out '' of fluctuation growth inherent in the more general class of background universes described above occurs . </S>",
    "<S> when `` freeze - out '' occurs , the correction factor reduces to unity and the standard press - schechter approximation must overestimate the collapsed fraction .    to illustrate this effect </S>",
    "<S> , we apply our model to currently viable versions of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model for structure formation , with primordial density fluctuations in accordance with data on cosmic microwave background anisotropy from the _ cobe _ satellite dmr experiment . for @xmath0 and matter - density parameter @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the open , matter - dominated cdm model and the flat cdm model with nonzero cosmological constant yield asymptotic collapsed fractions on the galaxy cluster mass - scale of @xmath2 and above of 0.0361 and 0.0562 , respectively , only 55% of the values determined by the press - schechter approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these results have implications for the use of the latter approximation to compare the observed space density of x - ray clusters today with that predicted by cosmological models .    </S>",
