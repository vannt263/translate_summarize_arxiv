    "the soft x - ray transient 17  ( = grs  1716@xmath3249 , nova oph 1993 ) was detected simultaneously with batse on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ , and the sigma telescope on _ granat _ , on 1993 september 25 ( harmon  1993a ; ballet  1993 ) .",
    "the source reached a maximum x - ray flux of @xmath01.4 crab ( 20100 kev ) within five days after first detection , and was remarkable for the stability of its hard x - ray emission on a time scale of days ; its hard x - ray flux declined at a rate of @xmath00.3@xmath10.05% per day ( harmon  1993b ) .",
    "17  was detected above the batse 3@xmath4 one - day detection threshold of 0.1 crab ( 20100 kev ) for @xmath080 days following the start of the x - ray outburst ( harmon & paciesas 1993 ) .",
    "a time - series analysis of the hard x - ray variability of 17 , observed with batse in the 20100 kev energy band , was presented by van der hooft  ( 1996 ) .",
    "they analyzed the entire 80 day x - ray outburst of 17  in the frequency interval 0.0020.488 hz .",
    "the power density spectra ( pdss ) of 17  show a significant peak , indicative of quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the time series , whose centroid frequency increases from @xmath00.04 hz at the start of the outburst , to @xmath00.3 hz at the end .",
    "van der hooft  ( 1996 ) discovered that the evolution in time of the pdss of gro  j1719@xmath324 can be described by a single characteristic profile .",
    "the evolution of the pdss can be described as a gradual stretching by a factor @xmath07.5 in frequency of the power spectrum , accompanied by a decrease of the power level by the same factor , such that the integrated power in a scaled frequency interval remains constant .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the x - ray variability during the entire outburst of gro  j1719@xmath324 can be described by a single process , the characteristic time scale of which becomes shorter , but the fractional amplitude of which is invariant .",
    "this may be related to the strong anticorrelation of the break frequency and power density at the break observed in the pdss of several black - hole candidates ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ) .",
    "mndez & van der klis ( 1997 ) suggest a correlation with mass accretion rate may exist , i.e. , the break frequency increases ( and the power density decreases ) with increasing mass accretion rate .",
    "two average pdss ( 20100 kev ) corresponding to days 1315 and 5160 of the x - ray outburst of 17  are displayed in figure  [ pds_1719 ] .",
    "17  remained undetectable until 1994 september , when several x - ray flares were detected with both sigma and batse ( churazov  1994 ; harmon  1994 ) .",
    "subsequent to strong x - ray flares in 1995 february ( borozdin , alexandrovich & sunyaev 1995 ) , a rapidly decaying radio flare was detected , followed by recurrent radio flaring activity ( hjellming  1996 ) .",
    "the relation between x - ray and radio events is similar to that observed in the superluminal radio - jet sources gro  j1655@xmath340 and grs  1915@xmath2105 ( hjellming  1996 ; foster  1996 ) : radio emission follows the peak , or onset to decay of x - ray flares observed with batse in the 20100 kev energy band , by intervals ranging from a few to 20 days ( hjellming  1996 ) .",
    "gro  j1655@xmath340 is a galactic black - hole candidate ( bhc ) with a dynamically determined mass of 7.0@xmath10.7 m@xmath5 ( orosz & bailyn 1997 ; van der hooft  1998a ) .",
    "a possible optical counterpart to the x - ray source was discovered by della valle , mirabel & rodriquez ( 1994 ) , the photometric and spectroscopic properties of which suggest that gro j1719@xmath324 is a low - mass x - ray binary",
    ". the optical brightness of 17 , measured during three weeks after first x - ray detection , is modulated at a period of 0.6127 days , thought to be the superhump period ( masetti  1996 ) .",
    "quiescent ( optical ) photometry and/or spectroscopy of 17  has not been reported .",
    "the source is considered a black - hole candidate on the basis of its x - ray and radio similarities to dynamically proven bhcs .",
    "we have investigated the phase ( or , equivalently , time ) lags in the hard x - ray variability of 17  during its 1993 x - ray outburst .",
    "we calculated lags between the 2050 and 50100 kev energy bands of the 1.024 sec time resolution batse data and compare our results with those obtained in recent similar studies of the black - hole candidates cyg  x-1 ( cui  1997 ; crary  1998 ) and gro  j0422@xmath232 ( grove  1997 ; van der hooft  1999 ) .",
    "a time - series analysis of the hard x - ray ( 20100 kev ) data of the entire 1993 outburst of 17  was presented by van der hooft  ( 1996 ) .",
    "these data were obtained in two broad energy channels ( 2050 and 50100 kev ) with the large - area detectors of batse , collected during 80 days following first x - ray detection on 1993 september 25 .",
    "fast fourier transforms were created for 524.288 sec long time intervals ( 512 time bins of 1.024 sec each ) ; the corresponding frequency interval covered 0.0020.488 hz .",
    "the average number of uninterrupted 512 bin segments available with the source unocculted by the earth was approximately 35 per day .",
    "see van der hooft  ( 1996 ) for a detailed description of the reduction and analysis of these data .",
    "the complex fourier cross spectra were created from the fourier amplitudes in a way identical to that described by van der hooft  ( 1999 ) .",
    "these cross spectra were averaged daily .",
    "errors on the real and imaginary parts of the daily averaged cross spectra were calculated from the respective sample variances , and formally propagated when computing the phase and time lags .",
    "the phase lags , @xmath6 , as a function of frequency were obtained from the cross spectra via @xmath6@xmath7arctan[im(@xmath8)/re(@xmath8 ) ] , and the corresponding time lag @xmath9@xmath7@xmath10 , with @xmath11 the frequency in hz of the @xmath12-th frequency bin . with these definitions , lags in the hard x - ray variations ( 50100 kev ) with respect to the soft x - ray variations ( 2050 kev )",
    "appear as positive angles .",
    "cross spectra for a large number of days must be averaged and converted to lag values in order to obtain sufficiently small errors ( see , e.g. , crary  1998 ; van der hooft  1999 ) .",
    "therefore , we averaged the phase and time lags between the 2050 and 50100 kev energy bands of the entire 80 day x - ray outburst of 17 .",
    "these are presented in figure  [ cross_1719 ] .",
    "the time lags are displayed on a logarithmic scale .",
    "time lags at frequencies above 0.5 @xmath13 are displayed but not taken into account in our analysis , as crary  ( 1998 ) have shown that data binning effects distort the shape of the cross spectra at these frequencies .",
    "these data show that at the lowest frequencies the phase lags are likely smaller than the high frequency lags ( 0.021@xmath10.028 rad , average of 0.0010.02 hz ; 9 bins ) . at frequencies above 0.02 hz ,",
    "the hard x - rays lag the soft by 0.072@xmath10.010 rad ( average of 0.020.20 hz ; 94 bins ) .",
    "the phase lags averaged over two 40 day intervals are similar to those averaged over the entire 80 day outburst , being 0.0017@xmath10.028 rad and 0.041@xmath10.043 rad , respectively , for the 0.0010.02 hz interval , and 0.082@xmath10.013 rad and 0.061@xmath10.016 rad , respectively , for the 0.020.20 hz interval .",
    "the time lags of 17  decrease with frequency as a power law , with index 1.04@xmath10.13 for frequencies @xmath140.01 hz . the extrapolation of this power law for frequencies smaller than 0.01 hz is well above the measured time lags .",
    "the 20100 kev energy spectrum steadily softened during the entire x - ray outburst of gro j1719@xmath324 in 1993 ; the photon index increased from 2.0 to 2.3@xmath10.05 during the rise to peak intensity , beyond which the spectrum softened more gradually .",
    "no marked changes in the spectral shape were observed during the sudden decrease in x - ray flux in 1993 december ( van der hooft  1996 ) .",
    "it is not possible , on the basis of 20100 kev batse observations alone to distinguish between black hole source states .",
    "however , observations at low x - ray energies during the decay of the x - ray light curve of 17 , suggest that the source was most likely in the low ( or hard ) state .",
    "the 2300 kev x - ray spectrum , obtained about 30 days after first detection of 17  by combining sigma data with quasi - contemporaneous data taken by ttm on board _ mir - kvant _ , was quite similar to the low state spectrum of cyg  x-1 .",
    "the 2300 kev spectrum of 17  then had a power - law shape without a soft component , and a cut off at energies above 100 kev ( revnivtsev  1998 ) .",
    "therefore , these observations indicate that 30 days after the x - ray outburst had started , 17  was in the low state .",
    "the lack of significant changes in the hard x - ray properties ( van der hooft  1996 ) of 17 , suggests that this conclusion applies to the entire 1993 outburst .",
    "recently , crary  ( 1998 ) and van der hooft  ( 1999 ) have studied lags between the x - ray flux variations in 2050 and 50100 kev batse data of the black - hole candidates cyg  x-1 and gro  j0422@xmath232 .",
    "cui  ( 1997 ) measured hard x - ray time lags in 260 kev _ rxte _ data of cyg  x-1 , obtained during 1996 .",
    "crary  ( 1998 ) studied cyg  x-1 for a period of almost 2000 days , during which the source was likely in both the low , and high or intermediate state .",
    "they found that the lag spectra between the x - ray variations in the 2050 and 50100 kev energy bands of cyg x-1 do not show an obvious trend with source state .",
    "they grouped the phase lag data according to the squared fractional rms amplitude of the noise , integrated in the frequency interval 0.030.488 hz .",
    "they find that at the lowest frequencies the phase lag is consistent with zero . for higher frequencies the hard phase lag increases to a maximum of 0.04 rad near 0.20 hz , and decreases again to near zero at the nyquist frequency .",
    "crary  ( 1998 ) showed that binning effects decrease the observed hard x - ray time lags to zero at the nyquist frequency .",
    "therefore , time lags obtained for frequencies between 0.5 @xmath13 and @xmath13 may be affected by data binning .",
    "the cyg  x-1 x - ray variations in the 50100 kev band lag those in the 2050 kev band over the 0.010.20 hz frequency interval by a time interval proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "cui  ( 1997 ) studied cyg  x-1 during its 1996 spectral transitions .",
    "the observed period can be divided into a transition from the hard state to the soft state , a soft state , and a transition from the soft state back to the hard state .",
    "the lag spectra obtained by cui  ( 1997 ) cover the frequency range 0.01100 hz .",
    "they find that during the state transitions the time lags between energy bands with average energy @xmath16 and @xmath17 , scale with photon energy roughly as @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "such a scaling is consistent with the predictions of thermal comptonization in the corona ( see , e.g. , payne 1980 ; hua & titarchuk 1996 ; kazanas , hua & titarchuk 1997 ) . in the soft state",
    "the time lags become much smaller .",
    "this implies that in the soft state the size of the corona becomes much smaller .",
    "van der hooft  ( 1999 ) determined lags in the hard x - ray variability of gro  j0422@xmath232 during its 1992 outburst .",
    "their time - series analysis covered the entire 180 day x - ray outburst .",
    "gro  j0422@xmath232 is a dynamically proven black - hole candidate ; during its 1992 outburst it was most likely in the low state ( van der hooft  1999 ) .",
    "they averaged the phase lags of gro  j0422@xmath232 over a 30 day interval following first x - ray detection of the source , and over a flux - limited sample of the remaining data ( 95 days ) .",
    "statistically significant lags were derived for the shorter interval only .",
    "they find that at the lowest frequencies the phase lag of gro  j0422@xmath232 is consistent with zero ( 0.014@xmath10.006 rad , 0.0010.02 hz ) . at frequencies",
    "@xmath140.02 hz , the variations in the 50100 kev band lag those in the 2050 kev band by 0.039@xmath10.003 rad ( average of 0.020.20 hz ) .",
    "the time lags of gro  j0422@xmath232 , during the first 30 days of its outburst , decrease with frequency as a power law , with index @xmath00.9 for @xmath20@xmath210.01 hz ( van der hooft  1999 ) .",
    "grove  ( 1997 ) studied the time lags of gro  j0422@xmath232 between the x - ray variations in the 3560 kev band and 75175 kev band with osse .",
    "they find that the hard x - ray emission lags the soft emission at all fourier frequencies , decreasing roughly as @xmath22 up to about 10 hz . at frequencies of @xmath00.01",
    "hz , hard time lags as large as 0.3 sec are observed .",
    "the hard time lags of gro  j0422@xmath232 obtained by grove  ( 1997 ) , are consistent with those obtained by van der hooft  ( 1999 ) .",
    "the phase lags of 17  are very similar to those of gro  j0422@xmath232 and cyg  x-1 . at frequencies below 0.02 hz",
    "very small lags are observed ( consistent with zero ) , while at frequencies of @xmath00.10 hz the variations in the 50100 kev band lag those in the 2050 kev band .",
    "however , the phase lags of 17 , averaged in the interval 0.020.20 hz , are about twice as large as those detected in gro  j0422@xmath232 and cyg  x-1 .",
    "these results show that the hard time lags observed in 17 , gro  j0422@xmath232 and cyg  x-1 are all very similar .",
    "the hard x - ray radiation lags the soft by as much as @xmath00.11 sec at low frequencies .",
    "the time lags are strongly dependent on the fourier frequency , and decrease roughly as @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath22 dependence of the hard time lags is very different from the lags expected from simple models of compton upscattering of soft x - rays by a cloud of hot electrons near the black hole .",
    "in such a case , the energy of the escaping photons increases with the time they reside in the cloud .",
    "therefore , higher energy photons lag the photons with lower energies by an amount proportional to the photon scattering time .",
    "if the hard x - rays are emitted from a compact region near the black hole , the resulting time lags should be independent of fourier frequency and of the order of milliseconds .",
    "analysis of the hard time lags in the x - ray variability of black - hole candidates can provide information on the density structure of the accretion gas ( hua , kazanas & titarchuk 1997 ) .",
    "kazanas  ( 1997 ) argued that the comptonization process takes place in an extended non - uniform cloud around the central source .",
    "they showed that such a model can account for the form of the observed pds and energy spectra of compact sources .",
    "hua  ( 1997 ) showed that the phase and time lags of the x - ray variability depend on the density profile of such an extended scattering atmosphere .",
    "their monte carlo simulations of scattering in a cloud with a density profile proportional to @xmath23 agree with our time lag data both in magnitude ( @xmath00.1 sec at 0.10 hz ) and frequency dependence ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the results presented here support the idea that the comptonizing regions around the black holes in cyg  x-1 , gro  j0422@xmath232 and gro  j1719@xmath324 are quite similar in density distribution and size .    however , the observed lags require that the scattering medium has a size of order 10@xmath24 to 10@xmath25 schwarzschild radii .",
    "it is unclear how a substantial fraction of the x - ray luminosity , which must originate from the conversion of gravitational potential energy into heat close to the black hole , can reside in a hot electron gas at such large distances .",
    "this is a generic problem for comptonization models of the hard x - ray time lags .",
    "also , such models do not specify the source of soft photons , nor do they account for the soft excesses and weak fe lines seen in the energy spectra .",
    "very detailed high signal - to - noise cross - spectral studies of the rapid x - ray variability of accreting bhcs , and combined spectro - temporal modeling may solve this problem .",
