    "in this section , we discuss the relaxation time of the @xmath3p nuclear spins caused by the ionization / deionization process under above - bandgap illumination .",

    "the nuclear spin relaxation rate @xmath59 is then calculated by multiplying @xmath58 with the effective recombination rate .    for the @xmath3p electron spin e@xmath5 coupled to the @xmath3p nuclear spin n by a hyperfine interaction @xmath25 , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath60 with the @xmath3p electron spin larmor frequency @xmath53 , and the electron spin and nuclear spin operators @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . for @xmath63 ,",

    "this can be understood by taking into account that to complete an ionization / deionization cycle , new spin pairs have to be generated after the recombination process . since this involves the capture of an electron from the conduction band by the @xmath3p@xmath13 , the characteristic time constant of the spin pair generation @xmath90 depends on the density of conduction electrons and ,",

    "<S> nuclear spin flips can also be induced by repeated ionization and deionization of the @xmath3p donor because of the mixing of the high - field eigenstates by the hyperfine interaction  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the probability of a nuclear spin flip for each ionization / deionization process is given by @xmath51  @xcite , where @xmath52 denotes the mixing angle as defined , e.g. , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with the @xmath3p hyperfine coupling @xmath25=117.5  mhz and the @xmath3p electron spin larmor frequency @xmath53=9.798  ghz at @xmath50=350.3  mt . a detailed analysis of the time evolution of the spin system  ( appendix b ) shows that for high @xmath18 @xmath54 with @xmath8=4  @xmath1s results in @xmath32=110  ms , in very good agreement with the experimentally observed relaxation time . for lower @xmath18 , the formation rate of new spin pairs by electron and hole capture processes decreases @xmath49  @xcite , resulting in an increase of the average time the spin pair spends in the ionized state </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the ionization rate and therefore the nuclear spin flip rate , explaining the observed increase of @xmath32 with decreasing @xmath18 [ cf .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : figure3](c ) ] .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated a fast and effective nuclear spin polarization scheme for @xmath3p nuclear spins in natural si at 5  k achieving a polarization of 66% within less than 100  @xmath1s . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization scheme does not rely on thermal equilibrium spin polarizations and therefore works at easily accessible magnetic fields and temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we further note , that no electrical contacts are needed to create the polarization , they were used solely for the measurement of the polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the density of polarized nuclear spins in the studied sample is at most @xmath210@xmath55  @xmath56 , limited by the concentration of sl1 centers , and therefore orders of magnitude too small for a possible application in magnetic resonance imaging . </S>",
    "<S> however , systems with a much larger density of spin pairs can be envisaged like , e.g. , p - doped silicon nanoparticles . here </S>",
    "<S> , the nanoparticle diameter , the doping concentration and the density of dangling bond defects can be adjusted such that each nanoparticle contains one p donor and one defect with high probability  @xcite , so that spin pair densities of more than 10@xmath57  @xmath56 could be achieved , sufficient for nuclear magnetic resonance imaging . for such @xmath3p - p@xmath14 spin pairs </S>",
    "<S> , we have obtained a nuclear spin polarization of @xmath33 30% at the si : p / sio@xmath6 interface , indicating that the described method is also applicable to them .    </S>",
