    "in one - dimensional systems , already a local perturbation can have important and interesting effects .",
    "this holds for the transport properties , but also for the entanglement between two pieces of a quantum chain .",
    "the influence of a defect located at the interface between them was first investigated by levine for a luttinger liquid @xcite . in this case , also studied on a lattice in @xcite , the interaction leads to a strong renormalization of the defect strength @xcite and thus to special properties .",
    "the situation is simpler for a fermionic hopping model , or xx chain , which was investigated in @xcite .",
    "in this case it was found that the logarithmic dependence of the entanglement entropy @xmath0 on the subsystem size @xmath1 remains intact , but the prefactor depends continuously on the defect strength .",
    "thus , for @xmath2 interfaces @xmath3 with a variable coefficient which replaces the central charge @xmath4 of the pure system . the dependence of @xmath5 on the defect was determined rather precisely by numerical calculations , both in xx chains and in transverse ising ( ti ) chains @xcite .",
    "but although a simple analytical expression fits the data qualitatively , no exact formula has been given so far .",
    "in this paper , we want to look at this problem once more and present an analytical treatment based on the connection with a two - dimensional classical system with a defect line . for the ti quantum chain",
    ", this is a two - dimensional ising model where defect lines are in fact marginal perturbations which lead to variable local magnetic exponents and have been studied over the years by various methods , see @xcite for a review and @xcite for a more recent approach using boundary conformal field theory .",
    "our techniques will be simpler and purely fermionic .",
    "using conformal mapping , we will reduce the considerations to the study of the transfer matrix in a strip with defect lines parallel to the edges @xcite . from its single - particle excitations",
    "we will obtain not only the spectrum of the reduced density matrix , but also the formula for the effective central charge .",
    "our approach is similar to a recent calculation by sakai and satoh , who treated conformal interfaces between two different bosonic systems with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "actually , we were motivated by this work , because the formula found there does not describe the results found in the fermionic xx and ti chains .",
    "nevertheless , our final result will turn out to be closely related .    in the following section 2 we set up the problem and present some numerical results for the spectrum of the reduced density matrix for later comparison . in section 3",
    "we describe the connection of the ti chain with the two - dimensional ising model , including the necessary renormalization of parameters . in section 4",
    "we determine the proper transfer matrix in the strip and its single - particle spectrum .",
    "this allows us to find the entanglement entropy in section 5 and to give a closed formula for @xmath5 .",
    "en route , we also obtain the largest eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix . in section 6",
    "we sum up our findings and discuss the extension to other chains and defects .",
    "additional details of the transfer matrix calculation are given in appendix a , while in appendix b we show that with our spectra one can also rederive the local magnetic exponent , which is a check on the approach and a further application .",
    "in the following we will study the transverse ising chain with @xmath7 sites , open ends and hamiltonian @xmath8 where the @xmath9 are pauli matrices at site @xmath10 .",
    "we are interested in the entanglement of one of the half - chains with the other in the ground state . to have a modified bond at the interface , the parameters are chosen as @xmath11 , @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , a modified transverse field at the interface is described by @xmath11 for @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "we work at the critical point given by @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath17 is normalized such that the velocity of the single - particle excitations in the homogeneous system is @xmath18 and only one parameter , the defect strength @xmath19 , remains .    to calculate the entanglement , one introduces fermions in ( [ hamti ] ) via the jordan - wigner transformation and then determines the fermionic single - particle eigenvalues @xmath20 of the operator @xmath21 in the exponent of the reduced density matrix @xmath22 from the correlations @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath23 is then given by @xmath24 numerical calculations along these lines were done in @xcite for the case of a ring with @xmath25 equal defects on opposite sides .",
    "this configuration has essentially the same features as the open chain and one obtains the result ( [ ceff ] ) with @xmath26 .",
    "the effective central charge @xmath27 rises from zero for @xmath28 ( where the system is cut in two ) to one - half for @xmath29 ( where it becomes homogeneous ) .",
    "it is shown in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the same function had been found before , also numerically , for the case of a segment in an infinite xx chain with a hopping defect at one interface @xcite .",
    "the other , unmodified interface then contributes an additive constant to @xmath27 .",
    "the background of this universality is the close connection between the two kinds of chains . by taking a critical ti chain with a bond defect and another one with a field defect ,",
    "both of strength @xmath19 , superimposing them and using dual variables , one arrives at @xcite @xmath30 it was shown in @xcite that the xx system with @xmath7 sites in the subsystem and the combined ti systems with @xmath1 sites have the same set of eigenvalues @xmath20 .",
    "this holds even in the inhomogeneous case and can easily be checked numerically . as a consequence , @xmath31 , which explains the common @xmath5 .",
    "given the central role of the single - particle spectrum of @xmath21 , it is important to see how this spectrum varies with the defect strength .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] for ti chains with @xmath32 sites .     as a function of the defect strength for ti chains with @xmath32 sites . ]",
    "the characteristic feature is the development of a gap at the lower end of the spectrum and an upward shift of the whole dispersion curve , which increases roughly like @xmath33 as @xmath19 goes to zero .",
    "this upward shift causes a decrease of @xmath0 for a fixed value of @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", it makes @xmath0 vanish if @xmath28 and the system is cut in two .",
    "the logarithmic variation of @xmath0 with @xmath1 , on the other hand , is related to a gradual lowering of the eigenvalues as @xmath1 increases .",
    "these features will be found again in the analytical treatment , to which we now turn .",
    "in the case of a homogeneous chain , the ti hamiltonian commutes with the diagonal transfer matrix of an isotropic two - dimensional ising model and its ground state can be obtained from the partition function of a long ising strip @xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix is then given by a strip with a perpendicular cut as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : confgeom ] on the left .",
    "one expects that the chain with a defect is related to a planar ising system with a defect line as indicated .",
    "however , the relations in @xcite show that by diagonally layering the ising lattice one can not obtain a commuting ti hamiltonian with only a @xmath34 modification ( bond or field ) .",
    "therefore we consider a lattice in the normal orientation and its row or column transfer matrices .",
    "it is well - known , that in a proper anisotropic ( hamiltonian ) limit , they are just the exponential of a ti operator .",
    "this also holds with defect lines . for the case of a ladder defect",
    ", we can refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : latgeom ] .",
    "if the horizontal couplings are large and the vertical ones are small , the column transfer matrix , running in the direction of the ladder , is given by @xmath35 with @xmath17 as in ( [ hamti ] ) and @xmath36 a constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is the dual coupling of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and thus also small by assumption .",
    "the parameters in @xmath17 are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 . at the critical point @xmath43 and",
    "one obtains the critical ti model with a bond defect given by @xmath44 .     for a half - chain by two - dimensional partition functions .",
    "left : original representation .",
    "centre : simplified annular geometry . right : strip geometry obtained by mapping .",
    "the defect line is shown dotted . ]",
    "this is , however , not quite enough , since we want to use a conformal mapping in the following , for which the 2d system should be isotropic . in the homogeneous case , one can achieve this by a rescaling such that the velocity of the excitations becomes @xmath18 .",
    "thus one omits the factor @xmath45 in ( [ transferh ] ) and has @xmath46 .",
    "this is then valid in the continuum limit or for large distances . with a defect ,",
    "the situation is more subtle .",
    "the local magnetic exponent @xmath47 , which also gives the power - law decay of the correlations parallel to the defect , is for the ladder @xcite @xmath48 where the couplings are taken at criticality .",
    "thus it matters whether one is in the hamiltonian limit , where the argument in the @xmath49 is @xmath50 , or in the isotropic case , where it is @xmath51 with @xmath52",
    ". therefore the ti hamiltonian only corresponds to an isotropic system if also the defect parameter @xmath19 is renormalized to @xmath53 for a chain defect with modified horizontal couplings @xmath54 , analogous considerations apply .",
    "the ti hamiltonian then contains a modified field given by @xmath55 where now the dual couplings enter .",
    "these also appear in the local exponent and one has to renormalize the defect parameter to @xmath56 where one can use @xmath57 .",
    "having related the ti chain to an isotropic ising lattice , we can now turn to the partition function . instead of studying the geometry shown on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : confgeom ] , we will consider the one in the centre , where the system is an annulus with a small inner radius @xmath58 of the order of the lattice constant and outer radius @xmath59 .",
    "this could be achieved approximately by the mapping used in @xcite .",
    "the pieces in the lower and upper half - plane can now be viewed as azimuthal corner transfer matrices ( ctms ) spanning an angle of @xmath60 and containing a defect line in their centre . using the mapping @xmath61",
    ", the annulus becomes the strip shown on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : confgeom ] with width @xmath62 and height @xmath63 .",
    "one can now calculate the partition function @xmath64 for a strip formed by repeating @xmath10 such units to give a height of @xmath65 , and closed in the vertical direction .",
    "then @xmath0 follows from the usual formula , used also in @xcite , @xmath66 however , since the transfer matrix needed to calculate @xmath64 is just the transform of the corner transfer matrix which upon squaring gives @xmath67 , one can also obtain the single - particle eigenvalues in @xmath21 directly from it and then use ( [ ent - thermo ] ) .",
    "we now consider the strip and discretize the problem again by inserting a lattice with @xmath68 rows and @xmath69 columns .",
    "the couplings are isotropic , but we leave them anisotropic for the moment .",
    "the basic unit is half the strip with @xmath70 rows and one defect line in the middle .",
    "this is shown , for the case of a ladder defect , in fig .",
    "[ fig : latgeom ] . the row transfer matrix for the whole unit will be called @xmath71 .",
    "it has the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the symmetrized row transfer matrix for one step and @xmath74 describes the ladder .",
    "the quantities @xmath75 and @xmath76 contain the vertical and the horizontal bonds , respectively , and are given by @xmath77 where we left out a prefactor in @xmath75 which is not important here .",
    "the second , fermionic forms arise after a spin rotation and a jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "the ladder operator is @xmath78 where @xmath79 has the same structure as @xmath75 with @xmath80 replacing @xmath81 .",
    "although such product matrices as @xmath82 and @xmath71 can be diagonalized for the open boundaries we want to treat @xcite , the procedure is much simpler for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we therefore assume these for the moment , which will give us the functional form of the eigenvalues .",
    "a fourier transformation @xmath83 then gives @xmath84\\right\\ } \\end{split } \\label{eq : v12q}\\ ] ] where the momenta @xmath85 are different for even or odd total fermion number .",
    "the problem now separates in @xmath86 subspaces , and is solved by introducing new operators @xmath87 via a bogoljubov transformation @xcite @xmath88 the diagonal form of the operator @xmath82 then reads , after changing to @xmath89 @xmath90 with the well - known dispersion of the homogeneous system @xmath91 in a second step , one uses this result to diagonalize @xmath71 .",
    "some details are given in appendix a. @xmath71 has the same exponential form ( [ eq : vdiag ] ) as @xmath82 but with other operators and single - particle eigenvalues @xmath92 given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "this is completely general .",
    "we now specialize to an isotropic critical system and small @xmath95 .",
    "then one has @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the second term in ( [ eq : omegak1 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "if one writes @xmath98 for the eigenvalues of the homogeneous system , the relation becomes @xmath99 the basic feature is that the defect introduces a gap @xmath100 into the spectrum , because it makes the system locally non - critical .",
    "the parameter @xmath101 can be rewritten as @xmath102 which gives via ( [ tbond ] ) a very simple relation with the chain parameter @xmath19 @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] we show the resulting dispersion curves for several values of @xmath19 .",
    "one sees that they become rapidly linear for larger values of @xmath104 and show an upward shift , which from ( [ eq : omegak2 ] ) is @xmath105 and thus varies logarithmically with @xmath19 for small @xmath19 .",
    "these are exactly the features found in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] for the numerical eigenvalues of the operator @xmath21 . according to the remark at the end of section 3",
    ", these should correspond to @xmath106 , since one needs two transfer matrices to build the full system .",
    "a comparison of the numerical values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 verifies ( [ eq : omegak2 ] ) relatively well , but there are shifts which may have to do with the open boundaries .",
    "the allowed values of the momenta @xmath95 in this case have to be determined from an equation which is known in the homogeneous case @xcite and will be modified by the defect . in particular , they will vary with the defect strength .     for several values of the defect strength . ]",
    "so far our consideration has been for a ladder defect in the lattice .",
    "the case of a chain defect can be obtained very simply by making a dual transformation in the transfer matrices @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this leaves the spectrum invariant , but changes vertical bonds into horizontal ones .",
    "the resulting chain defect then has coupling @xmath80 . changing this into the desired @xmath54 ,",
    "one finds that @xmath109 has again the form ( [ eq : chdelta2 ] ) with @xmath19 now given by ( [ tfield ] ) .",
    "thus bond and field defects in the ti chain lead to the same transfer matrix spectra .    one should mention that a similar situation was found for ctm spectra in critical ising models with a radial perturbation of the couplings decaying as @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "this problem can be mapped to a homogeneous strip which is slightly non - critical .",
    "the dispersion relation then assumes the relativistic form @xmath111 .",
    "our result reduces to this form for small @xmath112 .    for the following considerations we define the parameter @xmath113 which will turn out to be the quantity used in ref . @xcite .",
    "we are now in the position to evaluate @xmath0 . for this",
    "we insert @xmath106 as single - particle eigenvalues in the expression ( [ ent - thermo ] ) and assume a large value of @xmath69 , so that the sum can be converted into an integral via @xmath114 the gradual shift of the allowed values of @xmath95 for free boundaries does not play a rle in this limit .",
