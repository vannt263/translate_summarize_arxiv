    "during the three years since the previous meson - nucleon ( menu ) conference , there have been many lattice qcd computations of bottom and charmed hadron masses .",
    "these studies must handle challenges due to the physical quark masses being spread out relative to the natural lattice scales , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the ultraviolet cutoff ) : @xmath2",
    "during the past three years , the cdf and d0 collaborations have published first observations of the @xmath3@xcite , @xmath4@xcite , @xmath5@xcite and @xmath6@xcite baryons .",
    "the two results for the @xmath6 are not consistent with one another .    various lattice qcd groups have computed the mass spectrum using different b - quark actions ( _ nrqcd_@xcite , _",
    "fermilab_@xcite , _",
    "static_@xcite ) , different light - quark actions ( _ nonperturbatively - tuned clover_@xcite , _ improved staggered_@xcite , _ chirally - improved_@xcite , _",
    "domain wall_@xcite , _ improved - staggered sea with domain wall valence_@xcite ) and different gauge actions ( _ iwasaki_@xcite , _ one - loop symanzik / lscher - weisz_@xcite ) .",
    "any action with the correct continuum limit is a valid approach , and these complementary studies provide valuable information about systematic uncertainties at present lattice spacings and volumes .",
    "chiral extrapolations toward the physical u and d quark masses are also a source of systematic uncertainty , and the recent bottom baryon studies reach a minimum pion mass near 275 mev@xcite , 290 mev@xcite , 331 mev@xcite , 461 mev@xcite and 600 mev@xcite .",
    "figure  [ bottombaryons ] conveys an impression of some results from these recent studies of bottom baryons , but of course the original publications provide many additional insights . for example , @xcite provides a discussion of systematically - large splittings for @xmath7 versus @xmath8 that arise with a staggered lattice action due to the inability to separate @xmath9 and @xmath10 states using the spin projection operators .",
    "it is clear from figure [ bottombaryons ] that lattice simulations are consistent with the cdf measurement of the @xmath6 mass as opposed to the d0 result .",
    "lattice findings also agree with experiment for all other available masses , and lattice predictions are in place for comparison to future experimental discoveries .",
    "two related preprints have appeared after the menu 2010 conference .",
    "wagner and wiese@xcite have computed the baryon spectrum in the limit of a static bottom quark , where the twisted mass action was used for u , d quarks .",
    "meinel@xcite has produced a preprint that is focused on the mass of the @xmath11 .",
    "using nrqcd bottom quarks on dynamical lattice configurations , he arrives at @xmath12 where the third uncertainty arises from required experimental input .",
    "this mass with excusively heavy valence quarks can be of significant value for testing the content of theoretical models .",
    "[ bottombaryons ]   given in equation ( [ eqmeinel]).,title=\"fig:\",width=642 ]",
    "in contrast to @xmath13 , the charmed quark mass is smaller than the standard lattice cutoff so neither nrqcd nor static quark actions are generally useful .",
    "two lattice groups@xcite have recently used the fermilab action for the charmed quark and gauge configurations containing staggered u , d , s sea quarks to obtain charmed baryon masses .",
    "liu , lin , orginos and walker - loud@xcite used domain wall valence u , d , s quarks while na and gottlieb@xcite used the staggered action .",
    "the lightest u , d masses correspond to @xmath14 mev .",
    "some results are shown in figure [ llowfig14 ] , which was taken directly from @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see the consistency of the new results with the older simulations@xcite which had relied on the quenched approximation .",
    "[ llowfig14 ]   and @xmath15 .",
    "this graph has been taken directly from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=366 ]",
    "recent lattice results for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons are compiled from @xcite in figure [ bottommesons ] and compared to experimental data where available .",
    "two groups@xcite used the nrqcd action for the bottom quark while the others@xcite extrapolated from static quark simulations .",
    "the light quark action was nonperturbatively - improved clover@xcite , twisted mass@xcite or hisq ( staggered)@xcite .",
    "systematic deviations of lattice from experiment are observed in some cases . the spread among lattice results in figure [ bottommesons ] provides an impression of the systematic errors in current lattice simulations , but for detailed discussions see the original lattice papers@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the precise and accurate lattice result for the @xmath18 mass , coming from the hpqcd collaboration , was obtained by tuning the standard qcd inputs to match the experimental masses of pion , kaon , @xmath19 and @xmath20@xcite .",
    "their @xmath21 mass stands as a precise prediction for future experiments .",
    "interesting work has also been reported for mesons in the limit of a static ( infinitely - heavy ) bottom quark@xcite .",
    "this unphysical limit shares many qualitative features with the physical spectrum and has been used in combination with charmed meson masses to interpolate to the region of physical bottom mesons . as evident from figure [ staticmesons ] , a long list of quantum numbers has been studied .",
    "the variance among different lattice determinations of some masses suggests the presence of significant systematic effects .",
    "details can be found in the original articles@xcite .",
    "[ bottommesons ]     [ staticmesons ]",
    "the spectrum of charmed mesons has not received much attention recently from the lattice community , and thus represents a future opportunity .",
    "dong et al.@xcite have studied the @xmath22 spectrum , motivated in part by published speculations that the experimentally - observed @xmath23 might not be a @xmath24 state but rather a dk molecule , a four - quark state or a threshold effect .",
    "they use domain wall sea quarks , overlap valence quarks and an iwasaki gauge action with a lattice spacing of 0.08 fm , a lattice volume of ( 2.7 fm)@xmath25 and a pion mass as light as 331 mev .",
    "figure [ ds ] is taken directly from their conference report@xcite .",
    "dong et al .",
    "conclude that their preliminary results are consistent with the @xmath23 being a standard @xmath24 meson .",
    "thanks to the organizers of the menu 2010 conference , held at the college of william and mary , for the opportunity to participate .",
    "this work was supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
