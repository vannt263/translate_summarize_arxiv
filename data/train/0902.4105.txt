    "the dense , supersonic winds that give wr stars their characteristic emission - line spectra carry significant mass loss ( @xmath2 m@xmath3y@xmath4 ) and kinetic energy ( @xmath5 l@xmath6 ) .",
    "the release of some of this energy from the collision of such a wind with that of a massive companion in a colliding - wind binary ( cwb ) system gives rise to a range of theoretically predicted ( x - ray emission ) and unpredicted ( non - thermal radio emission and dust formation ) phenomena .",
    "the association of dust formation with colliding winds began with the demonstration that the 2900-d periodic dust formation episodes by the archetypal wolf - rayet colliding - wind binary wr140 occurred during periastron passages of its highly eccentric orbit ( williams et al .",
    "the high densities ( 10@xmath7 10@xmath8 times that of the undisturbed wolf - rayet wind ) required for dust formation to occur can be produced in colliding - wind shocks if they cool efficiently ( usov 1991 ) .",
    "the link between the dust - formation episodes and binary orbit in wr140 is provided by periodic increases of the _ pre - shock _ wind density by a factor of @xmath9 40 for a brief time during periastron passage when the separation of the wc7 and o5 stars is at a minimum ( williams 1999 ) .",
    "slightly different behaviour is shown by the wc7+o9 periodic dust - maker wr137 , whose dust - formation and rv orbital periods are identical within the uncertainties , but there is a 1.3-y ( 0.1  p ) delay between periastron passage and infrared maximum ( williams et al .",
    "2001 , lefvre et al .",
    "evidence for a cwb origin for the persistent dust formation by many wc89 stars comes from the rotating ` pinwheel nebulae ' observed around wr104 ( tuthill , monnier & danchi 1999 ) and wr98a ( monnier , tuthill & danchi 1999 )  although it should be noted that we do not have orbits for these systems , and only wr104 has a spectroscopic companion .",
    "these results show the way to solving the long - standing mystery of dust formation by wolf - rayet stars within the framework of wind compression and cooling in cwbs .",
    "the processes are being intensively studied in wr140 , whose orbit is now well defined ( marchenko et al .",
    "2003 , dougherty et al . 2005 ) and whose dust has been imaged at high resolution ( monnier , tuthill & danchi 2002 , williams et al .",
    "2007 ) , but further examples are needed where we can relate the dust formation to the binary orbit .    for this purpose , we selected wr19 (= ls3 , smith 1968 ) , which differs from other dust - making wr stars in having an earlier spectral subtype . in her discovery paper , smith classified its spectrum as wc5+ob , the ` + ob ' inferred from the weakness of the emission lines ( footnote in smith , shara & moffat 1990a , who noted the absence of absorption lines ) .",
    "it was reclassified as a member of the new wc4 sub - class in the sixth catalogue ( van der hucht et al .",
    "1981 ) but was returned to wc5 by crowther , de marco & barlow ( 1998 ) , in both cases without reference to a companion . in either event , the subtype is earlier than those of the other episodic and persistent dust makers ( wc78 and wc810 respectively ) .",
    "dust formation by wr19 was first reported by williams et al .",
    "( 1990b , hereafter paper  1 ) , who found a near - infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) showing 780-k dust emission , which evolved to one characteristic of the stellar wind within two years as the dust emission faded .",
    "this prompted continued infrared monitoring to look for another episode of dust formation , and spectroscopy to search for the companion suggested by the weak emission lines ( smith ) and possible cwb origin of the dust .",
    "the results of both searches were reported by veen et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter paper  2 ) , who discovered a second dust - formation episode 10.1  y after the first and presented blue - green spectra showing absorption lines from which the companion was classified as a o9.59.7 star .",
    "they concluded that wr19 was probably an eccentric wce+o9.59.7 binary .    if the wr140 paradigm held for wr19 , we expected it to be a spectroscopic binary of fairly high orbital eccentricity having its next periastron passage coinciding with its next dust formation episode in 200708 .",
    "we therefore set out to observe its rv to look for variations to confirm its status as a binary , continuing at least until after 2008 .",
    "we also sought infrared photometry to confirm the expected dust - formation episode and apparent 10.1-y period inferred from the first two episodes observed . in this paper , we report these observations and the confirmation of the cwb status of wr19 .",
    "the spectra were observed with the emmi instrument on the 3.5-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at the european southern observatory , la silla .",
    "as the investigation required relatively short observations spread over several years , all but the first were taken in the service observing mode , and we continued seeking observations for as long as this programme was offered at la silla . fortunately , this continued long enough to take us through periastron passage .",
    "we elected to concentrate our search for rv variations on the absorption - line spectrum .",
    "we used the emmi blmd grating # 3 and set it to give a spectrum running from 3925  to 4382 ( fig.[fspec ] ) covering the interstellar caii k line to h@xmath10 .",
    "the interstellar lines were included to provide a check on the wavelength scale . an 0.7-arcsec entrance slit gave a spectral resolution of 1.06    ( 2.5 pixels ) , confirmed from measurement of the interstellar k line . a standard observing block ( ob ) comprising two 1475-s integrations on the star followed by 240  s on the thar calibration lamp ( separate th and ar lamps for the earliest observations ) was compiled to fit the 1-h ob limit for service observations .",
    "inevitably , there was a large range in s / n ratio ( typically 4080 ) in the final spectra depending on the observing conditions , and sometimes two obs were observed sequentially if conditions were particularly poor .        the spectra were reduced using figaro .",
    "initial experiments suggested that the wavelength shifts of the emission features available ( fig.[fspec ] ) could be determined by cross - correlation with a template derived from a high - quality spectrum ( that observed in 2003 january ) , but this was found not to be the case when more data became available .",
    "instead , we used the cross - correlation method to derive the absorption - line velocities , useful in dealing with blends like that of heii with hei at 4026  and h@xmath11 with niii at 4097  and 4103 , which broadened the profile to 7.3  compared with 5.7   for h@xmath10 . the use of a template based on a spectrum of the object star and rectification of the spectral regions covering each of the absorption lines before cross - correlation minimised the introduction of systematic errors in derivation of the rvs .",
    "we measured velocities for the absorption lines individually , from which we derived uncertainties , and separated those of the interstellar caii h line from h@xmath12 by constructing two versions of the template and appropriate masking .",
    "finally , small adjustments to the velocities were made to fit the shifts of the interstellar caii h and k lines and , where possible , ch@xmath13 at 4232 .",
    "the relative rvs and their errors are given in table [ trv ] and plotted against date in fig.[sofirv ] .",
    "we also measured the heliocentric rv of the 2003 january spectrum used for the template by fitting gaussians to the absorption lines ( apart from the h@xmath11+niii blend ) to be 8.6@xmath145.4 km  s@xmath4 .",
    ".absorption - line radial velocities ( km  s@xmath4 ) of wr19 relative to that on mjd 52666 ( 2003 january 26 ) .",
    "the phases were calculated using p = 3689  d. from the photometry and @xmath15 = mjd 50500 from the orbital solution . [ cols=\"<,^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tprops ]    the new observations of wr19 have confirmed its status as a periodic , dust - forming cwb .",
    "more observations are needed to strengthen the period and orbit , including the wc star to get a mass ratio , but wr19 is available as a laboratory to study wind collision effects .",
    "for example , spectroscopy of the hei @xmath161.083-@xmath17 m line will be valuable not only to determine the wind velocity but also for mapping the wind - collision region through variation of the absorption component and the appearance and movement of sub - peaks on the broad emission component , as in wr140 ( varricatt , williams & ashok 2004 ) .",
    "leitherer , chapman & koribalski ( 1997 ) and chapman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) included wr19 in their surveys of radio emission from southern wr stars but found only upper limits .",
    "this does not rule out non - thermal emission from colliding winds , because the longer wavelength ( 13 and 20  cm ) observations , more likely to show non - thermal emission having a negative spectral index , were taken in 1997.15 , very close to periastron passage when the wind - collision region would have been most deeply embedded in the stellar winds and the circumstellar free - free extinction greatest  the non - thermal emission from wr140 is extinguished at this phase .",
    "re - observation of wr19 at different phases may reveal non - thermal emission when the geometry is more favourable .",
    "we can estimate the radio flux density of wr19 s stellar wind by assuming that its spectral index between mid - ir and cm wavelengths is similar to those of the wc5 stars , wr111 and wr114 , observed at 6  cm and 3.6  cm by cappa , goss & van der hucht ( 2004 ) and bieging , abbott & churchwell ( 1982 ) respectively .",
    "for the mid - ir fluxes of the stellar wind , we use the @xmath18 ( benjamin et al .",
    "2003 ) observations of wr19 , taken at phase 0.68 ( mjd 52997 ) when the dust emission is assumed to be long since faded ; the @xmath18 [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] magnitudes are in excellent agreement with our dust - free @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 magnitudes .",
    "to scale the radio flux densities of wr111 and wr114 , we used the glimpse [ 8.0 ] magnitudes of the three stars , leading to an estimated flux densiteis of @xmath9 0.07 mjy at 3.6 and 6  cm for wr19 .",
    "these are about one - quarter the 3-@xmath22 upper limit reported by leitherer et al .",
    ", so observation of the wr19 stellar wind should be possible in a reasonable integration time , providing a baseline for studying any non - thermal radio emission .",
    "similarly , although wr19 was not detected in the _ rosat _ survey of wr stars ( pollock , haberl & corcoran 1993 ) , its confirmation as a cwb and knowledge of its orbit justify re - observation of wr19 at x - ray wavelengths . selected properties of wr19 are collected in table [ tprops ] .",
    "all observations apart from the first spectrum were taken in the service observing mode , and it is a pleasure to thank the ntt support astronomers at la silla observatory for their care over the years in taking the observations and helpful correspondence regarding their preparation .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
