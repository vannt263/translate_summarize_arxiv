    "the large - scale distribution of galaxies contains the signature of acoustic waves that propagated through the universe prior to the epoch of recombination .",
    "this signal , referred to as baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , appears as a modulation in the amplitude of the galaxy power spectrum , @xmath12 , and a broad peak in the large - scale two - point correlation function , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of the oscillations in @xmath12 and the location of the peak in @xmath0 can be associated with the maximum distance that these acoustic waves can travel before the decoupling of matter and radiation , that is , the sound horizon at the drag redshift , @xmath13 . as this scale",
    "can be constrained with high accuracy from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the acoustic scale inferred from the clustering of galaxy samples at different redshifts can be used as a standard ruler to measure the distance - redshift relation , providing a powerful and robust probe of the expansion history of the universe @xcite .",
    "the bao signal was first detected in the clustering of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xcite and the luminous red galaxy ( lrg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xcite .",
    "since then , subsequent analyses on various galaxy samples have provided bao measurements with increasing precision @xcite . using these results",
    "it is now possible to construct a hubble diagram based entirely on bao distance measurements .",
    "it has become standard practice to use this information , in combination with additional data sets , when deriving constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "separate measurements of the acoustic scale in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight can be used to obtain constraints on the hubble parameter , @xmath14 , and the angular diameter distance , @xmath15 , through the alcock  paczynski test @xcite .",
    "however , the bao signal on angle - averaged clustering measurements such as @xmath12 or @xmath0 provide estimates of the average distance @xmath16 .",
    "although most analyses have focused on angle - averaged quantities , the large volumes probed by present - day galaxy samples make it possible to extend these analyses to anisotropic clustering measurements @xcite using the full power of the bao test .",
    "the clustering of galaxies encodes additional information beyond that contained in the bao signal that can significantly improve the cosmological constraints derived from large - scale structure ( lss ) data sets .",
    "this extra information is particularly important for anisotropic clustering measurements , where the signature of the so - called redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) can be used to constrain the growth rate of cosmic structures @xcite . in this way",
    ", anisotropic clustering measurements can provide information of the expansion history of the universe and the growth of density fluctuations , which can be used to distinguish between the dark energy and modified gravity scenarios for the origin of cosmic acceleration .",
    "the most accurate bao measurements to date have been obtained from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is one of the four component surveys of sdss - iii @xcite .",
    "after applying a modified version of the reconstruction technique of @xcite , the bao signal in the galaxy clustering of boss sdss data release 9 ( dr9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provided a 1.7 per cent accuracy measurement of the average distance @xmath17 at @xmath18 @xcite , as well as separate constraints on @xmath15 and @xmath14 at the same redshift with 3 and 8 per cent accuracy , respectively @xcite .",
    "these measurements have been complemented by analyses of the full shape of isotropic and anisotropic clustering measurements @xcite . besides galaxy clustering analyses ,",
    "a sample of high - redshift quasars from boss has been used to detect for the first time the signature of the bao in the fluctuations of the lyman-@xmath19 forest at @xmath20 @xcite .         in this paper",
    "we use information from the full - shape of the two - point correlation function and the clustering wedges statistic @xcite measured from boss data to derive constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "we extend the analyses of @xcite based on a high - redshift galaxy sample from boss dr9 to the data corresponding to dr10 @xcite and dr11 ( internal data - release ) , including results from the low - redshift boss galaxy sample .",
    "as the statistical uncertainties characterizing different cosmological observations become smaller , it is important to explore potential systematics that can be introduced by the analysis techniques and models applied to the data .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained by applying multiple methods to the same data can be used to identify the presence of systematics errors .",
    "our analysis is part of a series of papers examining the clustering properties of the boss dr10 and dr11 galaxy samples with different methodologies .",

    "@xcite investigate the potential systematic errors affecting anisotropic bao measurements .",
    "@xcite perform a detailed analysis of the effect of the uncertainties in the covariance matrices determined from mock catalogues on the obtained constraints .",
    "these analyses are complemented by those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who analyse the full shape of the monopole - quadrupole pair in configuration and fourier space .",
    "these studies attempt to condense the information of the clustering measurements into a few numbers reflecting the geometric constraints and the measurements of the growth of structures , that are then compared with the predictions from different cosmological models .",
    "we follow an alternative approach in which we perform the comparison with cosmological models at the level of the galaxy clustering measurements themselves .",
    "the consistency of the results presented here and those of our companion papers is a reassuring indication of the robustness of our results .",

    "we describe our galaxy sample , the procedure followed to obtain our clustering measurements and their respective covariance matrices , as well as the additional data sets included in our analysis . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we review our model of the full shape of the correlation function and the clustering wedges and our methodology to obtain cosmological constraints . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the constraints on cosmological parameters obtained from different combinations of data sets and parameter spaces .",

    "we use the lowz and cmass samples of boss corresponding to sdss dr10 @xcite and dr11 , which will become publicly available with the final data release of the survey .",
    "these galaxy samples were selected on the basis of the sdss multicolour photometric observations @xcite to cover the redshift range @xmath21 with a roughly uniform comoving number density @xmath22 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* padmanabhan et al . in preparation ) .",
    "up to @xmath23 and 2 per cent of lowz and cmass targets , respectively , were observed during the sdss i / ii surveys @xcite and thus already have a redshift .",
    "the remaining redshifts were measured from the spectra obtained with the double - armed boss spectrographs @xcite by applying the minimum-@xmath24 template - fitting procedure described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lowz sample consists primarily of red galaxies that lie in massive haloes , with a satellite fraction of 12 per cent @xcite .",
    "the cmass sample is approximately complete down to a limiting stellar mass of @xmath25 @xcite , and has a @xmath2610 per cent satellite fraction @xcite .",
    "although this sample is dominated by early type galaxies , it contains a significant fraction of massive spirals ( @xmath2626 per cent , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite describes the construction of catalogues for lss analyses based on these samples .",
    "we use these samples separately , restricting our analysis to the redshift ranges @xmath27 for the lowz sample , and @xmath28 for the cmass galaxies .",
    "we study the clustering properties of these galaxy samples by means of the angle - averaged correlation function , @xmath0 , and the clustering wedges statistic @xcite , @xmath29 , which corresponds to the average of the full two - dimensional correlation function @xmath30 over the interval @xmath31 , that is @xmath32 we use two wide clustering wedges , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , defined for the intervals @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the basic procedure implemented to obtain these measurements from the lowz and cmass samples is analogous to that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we summarize the most important points and refer the reader to these studies for more details .",
    "we convert the observed redshifts into distances assuming a flat @xmath3cdm fiducial cosmology characterized by a matter density parameter of @xmath35 .",
    "we use the estimator of @xcite to compute the full correlation function @xmath30 of the lowz and cmass samples , with random samples following the same selection function as the original catalogues but containing 50 times more objects .",
    "the value of @xmath36 of a given pair is defined as the cosine of the angle between the separation vector , @xmath37 , and the line - of - sight direction at the midpoint of @xmath37 .",
    "we infer the correlation function @xmath0 and the clustering wedges @xmath1 and @xmath2 by averaging the full @xmath30 over the corresponding @xmath36 intervals . as discussed in @xcite , this procedure correctly accounts for the @xmath36 dependence of the random - random counts , which is ignored when the estimator of @xcite is applied to the averaged counts directly , leading to a bias in the recovered clustering measurements .",
    "when computing the pair counts , we assign a series of weights to each object in our catalogue . first , we apply a radial weight designed to minimize the variance of our measurements @xcite given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the expected number density of the catalogue at the given redshift and @xmath40 is a scale - independent parameter , which we set to @xmath41 .",
    "we also include angular weights to account for redshift failures and fibre collisions .",
    "for the cmass sample we apply additional weights to correct for the systematic effect introduced by the local stellar density and the seeing of the observations , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the left panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : measurdr10 ] and [ fig : measurdr11 ] show the resulting angle - averaged correlation function @xmath0 of the sdss - dr10 and dr11 lowz ( upper ) and cmass ( bottom ) samples , respectively , while the left panels show the corresponding clustering wedges @xmath1 ( circles ) and @xmath2 ( squares ) .",
    "the anisotropic clustering pattern generated by redshift - space distortions leads to significant differences in the amplitude and shape of the two clustering wedges , with @xmath2 showing a lower amplitude and a stronger damping of the bao peak than @xmath1 .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the best - fitting @xmath3cdm model obtained from the combination of the lowz and cmass dr11 clustering wedges with cmb observations from the planck satellite @xcite and the cmb polarization measurements from wmap @xcite as described in section  [ sec : lcdm ] , which provide an excellent description of all our measurements .      when comparing our boss clustering measurements with theoretical predictions we assume a gaussian likelihood function of the form @xmath42 .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath24 value of a given model requires the knowledge of the inverse covariance matrix of our measurements , which we estimate using mock catalogues matching the selection functions of the lowz and cmass samples .",
    "these mocks were constructed from two sets of pthalos realizations @xcite , corresponding to our fiducial cosmology , as described in @xcite and manera et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "our cmass mocks are based on 600 independent simulations with a box size of @xmath43 , while those of the lowz sample were constructed from a separate set of 500 boxes with the same volume . in the construction of these mocks , the northern galactic cap ( ngc ) and southern galactic cap ( sgc ) components of the survey",
    "were considered as being independent , and sampled separately from the same pthalos realizations .",
    "the volume of the lowz sample allowed us to obtain two separate ngc and sgc mocks per pthalos realization , leading to 1000 independent combined ngc+sgc lowz mock catalogues .",
    "the larger volume of the cmass sample makes it more difficult to construct mocks of the ngc and sgc components from the boxes without overlap .",
    "this means that the ngc and sgc cmass mocks drawn from the same box are not independent . for dr10",
    "the overlap between the ngc and sgc mocks is approximately 75 per cent of the area covered by the sgc , while for dr11 the whole of the southern component is also covered by the ngc . to account for this overlap in our covariance matrix estimations",
    "we construct two sets of 300 independent ngc+sgc cmass mocks , drawing the matched components from different boxes ."
