    "over the past few decades , atomic , molecular , and optical ( amo ) systems have played an increasingly important role in shaping our understanding of complex quantum phenomena .",

    "photonic simulators generally permit control of system parameters and the detection of probability distributions at the microscopic , site - resolved level .",
    "however , the use of real materials as the medium for light transport makes these systems susceptible to inherent disorder in sample preparation  @xcite and to absorption in the material  @xcite , and makes simulations in higher spatial dimensions and time - dependent control of system parameters non - trivial . for cold atoms ,",
    "pristine and dynamically variable potential landscapes can be constructed based on their interaction with laser light .",
    "however , a microscopic control over system parameters is difficult to realize in atomic systems .",

    ", we propose an atom optics - based  @xcite approach to the study of coherent transport phenomena , which incorporates many of the desired features of atomic and photonic experimental platforms .",
    "the scheme we describe is motivated in spirit by magnetic resonance - based techniques for local manipulation via global field addressing  @xcite . in the context of studying transport phenomena , however , we consider an inhomogeneous landscape of site energies , with unique energy _ differences _ between neighboring sites , which defines unique tunneling resonances for each site - to - site link .",
    "combined with global field addressing that can drive transitions between neighboring sites , and in particular by simultaneous driving of many such transitions in an amplitude , frequency , and phase - controlled manner , this would allow for local control over the parameters of a discrete lattice model relevant to myriad coherent transport phenomena .",
    "atom optics offers a natural candidate system featuring a quadratic energy landscape and field - driven transitions between states . here",
    ", we propose to create a discrete `` lattice of sites '' represented by free - particle momentum states of atomic matter waves , having quadratic energy - momentum dispersion , which can be effectively nearest - neighbor coupled via resonant two - photon bragg transitions  @xcite .",
    "the free particle dispersion allows for spectrally - resolved control over all parameters of the system at the single - link level , including all site - to - site `` tunneling '' amplitudes and phases , achieved by writing multiple radiofrequency sidebands onto a pair of interfering laser beams .",

    "additionally , we show how another well established atoms optics tool - stimulated raman transitions that change both the internal state and momentum of atoms  @xcite - can be used to study non - abelian u(2 ) gauge fields , which to date have been difficult to realize in photonic and cold atom settings .",
    "the proposed scheme builds on a large body of work involving the study of transport phenomena using the evolution of momentum - space distributions of cold atomic gases  @xcite , including recent precision studies of the three - dimensional anderson insulator - metal transition  @xcite .",
    "while the majority of such studies have involved time - dependent driving by lattice potentials not fulfilling a resonant bragg condition , notably in the realization  @xcite of quantum kicked rotor models  @xcite , here our proposed method operates deep within the resonant bragg diffraction regime .",

    "we begin by considering a generic system of two - level atoms , having a single internal ground ( excited ) state @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) with energy @xmath2 and having a mass @xmath3 .",
    "these two - level atoms and their interaction with a driving electric ( laser ) field @xmath4 , neglecting spontaneous emission , are described in the dipole approximation by the single particle hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the free particle momentum of the atoms and @xmath7 is the atomic dipole operator , with @xmath8 a vector pointing from the atomic nucleus to the electron position .",
    "we assume that , as shown in fig .",

    "this large single - photon detuning from resonance makes direct population of the atomic excited state @xmath22 negligible . in the following",
    "we assume an effective ground - state hamiltonian @xmath29 based on adiabatic elimination of the excited state @xmath22 .",
    "this effective hamiltonian describes the free - particle kinetic energies @xmath30 and light - atom interactions @xmath31 that drive two - photon processes changing the atomic momenta by @xmath32 while leaving the internal state unchanged , characterized by virtual absorption of a photon from one laser field and stimulated emission into the other . assuming that the atomic source is a condensate of atoms with small momentum spread @xmath33",
    ", we now define a discrete basis of relevant plane - wave momentum states @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 an integer ) , having momenta @xmath36 .",
    "this discrete set of allowed momentum states will form the `` lattice of sites '' that can be coupled in a controlled way via two - photon transitions .",
    "these states have kinetic energies @xmath37 , where the single - photon recoil energy is given by @xmath38 . in the assumed form of the driving electric field @xmath4 , off - diagonal terms that increase the momentum by @xmath39 can in principle",
    "come about by absorption of a photon from the right - traveling field , followed by stimulated emission into any of the different frequency fields that constitute the left - traveling laser field .",

    "we now define the effective ground - state hamiltonian of this system in the interaction picture @xmath45 , where the time - dependence due to @xmath30 is moved onto the system operators . in the ground - state plane - wave basis ,",
    "the diagonal terms are now all zero ( up to an ignored diagonal ac stark shift that is common to all states ) . the nearest - neighbor off - diagonal elements , described in terms of the two - photon rabi couplings for all allowed transitions , take the time - dependent form @xmath46 where @xmath47 describes the two - photon detuning of the @xmath48 frequency component from the @xmath49 to @xmath50 transition , given as @xmath51 . here",
    ", the term @xmath52 describes the doppler frequency shift of the transition @xmath53 .",
    "given that the free - particle dispersion is quadratic , its linear first derivative relates to a linearly varying doppler frequency shift @xmath54 which serves to define the two - photon bragg resonance condition for the @xmath34 to @xmath50 transition .",
    "we can make use of this unique state - to - state frequency shift to achieve the stated goal of controlling the off - diagonal elements in a link - specific manner .",
    "we explicitly assume that the two - photon detuning between each frequency component @xmath40 of the left - traveling field and the right - traveling field approximately satisfies a unique bragg resonance condition .",
    "formally , for every frequency component of the field labeled by index @xmath40 , we set @xmath55 , with @xmath40 an integer and @xmath56 a small ( @xmath57 ) and controllable detuning from the @xmath58 two - photon bragg resonance .",
    "this now brings us to the physical picture of building up individual links between a `` lattice '' of discrete momentum states , through the engineering of many interfering laser frequency components . in the limit of `` weak - driving '' , which for this one - dimensional example we define as @xmath59 , the bandwidth of two - photon transitions is sufficiently reduced such that at most one frequency component has a substantial contribution to each off - diagonal element",
    "we then ignore all but the most near - resonant contribution for each off - diagonal coupling , in the spirit of a rotating wave approximation .",
    "this greatly simplifies the effective interaction - picture hamiltonian , leading to weakly time - dependent off - diagonal couplings of the form @xmath60 for any two coupled modes , this weak time - dependence can be further absorbed into diagonal `` site''-energies @xmath61 ( related by @xmath62 ) by a rotating frame transformation , permitting a fully time - independent hamiltonian description with a controlled `` potential landscape ''",
    ". we will assume the less general case , however , where all frequency components of the applied fields _ exactly _ fulfill a two - photon bragg resonance condition , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "we then arrive at the desired description of a single particle tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath64 here , arbitrary control over all tunneling amplitudes @xmath65 and tunneling phases @xmath66 of the system are enabled in a link - dependent way through control of a single global addressing field @xmath67 .",
    "this can be simply accomplished , for example , by passing a single laser beam through a pair of acousto - optic modulators driven by tailored radiofrequency signals  @xcite . moreover , the tailored radiofrequency signal can be smoothly varied in time , such that the parameters of the model system can be made time - dependent .    , are shone onto a collection of atomic matter waves .",
    "cross interferences between the two pairs of beams can be avoided by choice of laser polarizations or by introducing a frequency offset between the two pairs .",

    "while the ability to simulate arbitrary hamiltonians describing lattice transport in one dimension would allow for a number of interesting studies , particularly relevant to disordered and symmetry - protected topological states , the tunneling phases @xmath72 are of little physical consequence when applied only to one - dimensional systems with nearest - neighbor couplings . in higher dimensions ,",
    "a natural application of the ability to engineer link - specific phases would be to mimic the aharonov - bohm phase @xmath73 acquired by charged particles ( with charge @xmath74 ) moving along a path @xmath75 in an electromagnetic vector potential @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "this would allow the study of topologically non - trivial ( 2 + 1)-dimensional abelian u(1 ) models , such as those describing the integer quantum hall effect exhibited by electrons confined in two dimensions under the influence of strong transverse magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the local manipulation of phases could also allow the study of random magnetic flux models  @xcite , which are believed to exhibit metallic behavior and provide an interesting counterexample to anderson s theorem  @xcite in two dimensions .",
    "higher - dimensional studies allow access to novel lattice geometries as well , where link - specific control over tunneling amplitudes can be used to transform a simple square lattice into a brick - wall honeycomb lattice  @xcite by setting certain links to zero tunneling .",
    "in general this control allows one to impose hard - wall boundary conditions , and a two - dimensional scheme with tailored links would allow one to create one - dimensional systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "recently , researchers have used such a local manipulation in photonic simulators to probe novel questions about the bulk - boundary correspondence in integer quantum hall systems  @xcite .    here , we describe the simple extension to realizing two dimensional models that preserve full spectral control over all tunneling links ( with straightforward extensions to higher - dimensional systems as well ) .",
    "we consider the case of driving by two independent pairs of counter - propagating laser fields as shown in fig .  2 , where we neglect any effect of cross interferences ( by choice of polarization or an appropriate frequency offset ) .",
    "elementary changes to the atomic momentum by @xmath78 and @xmath79 result from allowed two - photon bragg processes as in the earlier - described scheme .",

    "if @xmath83 , this can allow for effectively higher - dimensional systems ( of finite extent ) to be realized even for @xmath84  @xcite . here",
    "we consider instead the case of driving by lattices with near - identical wavevectors along two different directions , i.e. @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "similar to the unique bragg transition frequencies @xmath89 between adjacent states @xmath34 and @xmath50 in one dimension , described in eq .",
    "[ eq : e3c ] , in two dimensions we have unique bragg transition frequencies that depend on the initial state @xmath80 and in which direction the momentum is imparted . for a momentum change of @xmath90 ,",

    "ii , through the application of spectral sidebands to one laser from each pair , being controlled in amplitude and phase and offset in frequency from the counter - propagating partner to fulfill particular resonance conditions , one may realize a two - dimensional abelian u(1 ) lattice model of the form @xmath95   \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    as a concrete example , we analyze in fig .  3 the effective dynamics that can be driven in a two - dimensional system with non - trivial tunneling phases , relating to an effective aharonov  bohm phase acquired by particles evolving in the system of momentum states .",
    "we show that far in the weak - driving limit , the effective dynamics that emerge from eq .",
    "( 5 ) exactly coincide with those of eq .",
    "( 11 ) . in the case of a non - zero synthetic magnetic flux , these dynamics show insulating behavior in the bulk of the system and transport along the edge of the system .",
    "the dynamics illustrated in fig .",
    "3 also highlight an important aspect of the simplest studies that can be performed using the proposed scheme - those involving population initiated in one or a few momentum states , with laser - driving turned on suddenly .",
    "similar to the case of many photonic simulators  @xcite , spatial projection onto the system s eigenmodes dictates the ensuing dynamics , and there is no explicit energy selection or preparation in the system s ground state . for a non - zero synthetic magnetic flux ,",
    "population initiated in the bulk of the system will remain stationary , while population on the system s edge will undergo transport .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "3 shows how particular edge modes can be populated by beginning with population in a superposition of multiple momentum states .",
    "given the similarities to photonic systems , with respect to projective state initialization and out - of - equilibrium dynamics , we expect that many of the techniques developed for studying topological properties of photonic simulators should prove useful in the envisioned atom optics setting  @xcite .",
    "one issue to note in accessing higher - dimensional models is that the frequency spacing between the link - specific bragg resonances , found in one dimension to have the value @xmath96 , is reduced as the number of links in each direction is increased .",
    "this in general requires lower tunneling rates ( two - photon rabi rates ) to remain in the weak - driving limit where individual resonances are spectrally resolved .",
    "practically , a more realistic approach to studying higher dimensional systems while preserving arbitrary control of all parameters may be found in systems extended in one direction and with only two or a few sites along a second  @xcite or second and third  @xcite direction .",
    "the suggested atom optics - based approach , which allows for precise and time - dependent control of a single particle lattice model at a link - specific level , affords many unique experimental capabilities relevant to quantum simulation .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the effective `` tunneling '' transitions between sites are explicitly field - driven and do not result from quantum tunneling through a barrier allows in principle for several unique features . as discussed in the previous section , this allows for the simulation of higher - dimensional systems of finite extent in three or fewer physical dimensions .",
    "it additionally allows for direct and independent control of tunneling terms beyond nearest - neighbor .",
    "for example , one can access next - nearest - neighbor hopping terms by driving second - order bragg processes with resonances given by @xmath97 , which are spectrally distinct from the first - order resonances  @xcite . controlled access to such terms would allow tunable symmetry breaking ( inversion or particle - hole ) of topological insulator systems .",
    "additionally , it has been shown  @xcite that the combination of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) tunneling in one dimension can be used to realize systems analogous to the two - dimensional haldane model  @xcite , allowing study of the anomalous quantum hall effect in an experimentally simple setting .",
    "such a combination of terms may also allow for the study of lifshitz - type behavior  @xcite , e.g. as found in axial next - nearest - neighbor ising ( annni ) models  @xcite .",
    "another relatively unique aspect of the proposed system stems from the combination of local and time - dependent parameter control . to note , either local control or time - dependent control of the system parameters",
    "would allow , e.g. , for the controlled implementation of quenched disorder or of a time - varying hamiltonian for quantum annealing to novel ground states  @xcite , respectively . in this context",
    ", their specific combination could allow for the study of _ annealed disorder _",
    ", with randomly distributed system parameters that are additionally modulated in time  @xcite .",
    "in essence , such modulation of the lattice parameters over an appropriate range of frequencies can mimic the coupling of particles to a thermal phonon bath . through the modulation of disorder at frequencies corresponding to relevant energy scales of the model system being studied , such annealed disorder could allow access to the thermodynamic properties of an otherwise intrinsically out - of - equilibrium system .      there exist several practical limitations to the timescales over which the proposed scheme can be used to simulate coherent dynamics .",
    "the major limitation comes from the fact that ultracold atoms are not idealized zero - momentum plane waves , but have a spread in momentum due to finite temperature , interactions between particles , and the zero - point motion associated with the ground state of their confining potential  @xcite .",
    "the momentum spread of trapped bose ",
    "einstein condensates is typically much smaller than the recoil momentum , @xmath33 , such that the picture of a discrete lattice of states is justified .",
    "however , even a small but finite momentum spread will introduce restrictions on the experimental timescales over which coherent momentum - space dynamics can be observed .",
    "coherent dynamics in momentum - space requires that momentum states with direct off - diagonal coupling occupy indistinguishable spatial modes . in other words , the laser - driven dynamics will occur only in the near - field regime  @xcite , before the populated momentum states have time to spatially separate into distinct wavepackets .    while this imposes a strong limit on the timescales over which coherent transport phenomena can be expected to occur",
    ", a significant number of coherent tunneling events can still be achieved .",
    "moreover , this effect will be less relevant to the observation of phenomena involving localized states or ballistic , non - dispersive propagation in momentum - space .",
    "still , we can provide a lower estimate for the limiting timescale based on the worst case scenario , the ramsey decoherence time in the absence of continuous coupling between two states .",
    "for nearest - neighbor states differing in velocity by @xmath98 ( with @xmath99 the recoil velocity ) , their spatial overlap will be lost roughly on the timescale @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the cloud s spatial coherence length along the direction of momentum transfer .",
    "we assume that @xmath101 is determined at ultracold temperatures and low densities by the finite system size in a trapping potential , and we relate this to the number of lattice sites @xmath102 ( of the interfering laser fields ) over which the atomic distribution would extend , with @xmath103 .",
    "this description allows for the simple relation @xmath104 , where @xmath105 .",
    "we recall that in one dimension the tunneling rates are restricted to be much less than @xmath96 to spectrally resolve individual link resonances . assuming tunneling rates @xmath106",
    ", we can expect ramsey coherence times corresponding to roughly @xmath107 tunneling events .",
    "this expected limitation to the scheme motivates some practical considerations . when implementing higher - dimensional `` lattices '' of momentum states , because the tunneling rates necessary to achieve complete spectral control of all tunneling parameters become severely restricted , the dynamics will remain coherent for far fewer tunneling events .",
    "we thus expect that it will be more realistic to pursue studies of one - dimensional lattice and superlattice systems , as well as ladder - type systems with only a few sites along a second direction  @xcite or two additional directions  @xcite .",
    "additionally , an active increase of the relevant experimental timescales may be achieved by increasing the spatial coherence length of the atomic sample prior to the lattice - driven dynamics .",
    "this can be achieved by an adiabatic decrease of the trapping depth and stiffness , leading to an increase of the atoms spatial extent  @xcite .",
    "one can also pursue still more active methods for increasing of the atomic sample s size based on analogies to gaussian beam optics , namely by using matter - wave lensing techniques  @xcite for the construction of an atomic beam expander or galilean telescope .",
    "such techniques have recently been employed to create mm - scale atomic clouds of @xmath108rb with pk - scale temperatures  @xcite , which for lattice light tuned near the d@xmath109 transition would allow for a few hundred coherent tunneling events in one dimension .    if these studies are performed in atomic free fall or free expansion , so as to minimize any influence of trapping potentials on the ensuing matter - wave dynamics , another practical limitation is found .",
    "assuming a geometry of lattice - driving along a direction perpendicular to gravitational acceleration , to avoid additional complications due to time - varying doppler shifts , then gravity will cause the atoms to fall away from the region of light - atom interaction . restricting the atoms to fall less than @xmath110  mm , for example , will restrict the experimental timescales to @xmath111  ms ( where @xmath112 is the assumed gravitational acceleration due to free fall ) , or roughly 270 tunneling events in the case of one - dimensional simulations .",
    "these timescales are generally less restrictive than those due to the near - field constraint , and can be largely assuaged through levitation in a magnetic field gradient without introducing significant external confinement .",
    "lastly , we remark that _ spontaneous _ photon scattering can in principle provide an additional limitation to the observation of coherent momentum - space dynamics driven by _ stimulated _ photon scattering  @xcite .",
    "practically , however , the heating rates due to off - resonant absorption and re - emission events can be mitigated by setting the single - photon detuning @xmath25 to be large compared to the spontaneous decay rate @xmath113 of the excited state @xmath22 .",
    "we now describe a straightforward extension to the scheme described in sec .",
    "ii , which is based on using internal state - changing two - photon raman transitions  @xcite as opposed to state - preserving bragg transitions .",
    "this modified scheme requires the use of two low energy internal ground states @xmath114 and @xmath115 , such as two @xmath116 zeeman sublevels of different hyperfine manifolds , as typically used in raman atom interferometers  @xcite . at low magnetic field , these states have an energy difference @xmath117 determined by their hyperfine splitting , which we assume greatly exceeds the largest kinetic energy scales in the problem . as we show below , this extra internal ground state degree of freedom , when combined with a laser - driving protocol similar to that described in sec .",

    "following the procedure outlined earlier , this u(2 ) lattice model can also be performed in more than one spatial dimension , allowing for a model of the form @xmath161   \\ \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] this allows for the study of genuine non - abelian u(2 ) models , where motion along closed paths can lead to non - trivial operations on the atoms internal degree of freedom .",
    "for the smallest counter - clockwise path around a four site plaquette , this can lead to an operation distinct from identity @xmath162 , @xmath163 such that the wilson loop variable associated with this closed path , tr(@xmath164 ) , is not equal to 2 , the dimension of the internal state space .",
    "independent control over all tunneling amplitudes and phases allows for the study of models with homogeneous wilson loops  @xcite for all elementary lattice plaquettes , as well as spatially varying and disordered configurations .",
    "in particular , it has been suggested that the u(2 ) random flux model may be of direct relevance to the effect of giant magnetoresistance displayed in manganese oxides  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while the described setup is clearly restricted to the simulation of matter interacting with _",
    "classical _ abelian and non - abelian gauge fields , ref .",
    "@xcite recently raised the interesting prospect of using such simulations - along with averaging over an appropriate distribution of static and annealed classical gauge field configurations - to gain insight into certain properties of lattice gauge theories describing the interaction of matter with _",
    "dynamical _ gauge fields .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a simple experimental scheme for studying nearly arbitrary single particle transport phenomena based on well established atom optics techniques .",
    "we described two variations of this scheme , based on internal state - preserving bragg transitions and internal state - changing raman transitions , which enable the study of abelian u(1 ) and non - abelian u(2 ) lattice models , respectively .",
    "some unique features of this platform were discussed , including the possibilities of studying annealed disorder and variable - range hopping .",
    "we have discussed practical limitations to the timescales of coherent evolution that this scheme allows , which relate to several tens to several hundreds of tunneling events for realistic system parameters .",
    "we neglected discussion of further extensions , such as the use of additional internal ground states for the simulation of u(@xmath165 ) models with @xmath166 , and we neglected a discussion of the important and intriguing role of nonlinear interactions between the atoms themselves .",
    "in contrast to many photonic simulators , a system of atomic condensates evolving in momentum space would naturally play host to significant nonlinear processes  @xcite , such as cross - phase modulation , self - phase modulation , and four - wave mixing  @xcite . moreover , the general scheme of developing link - resolved control of tunneling by use of an inhomogeneous potential and global field addressing may be transportable to strongly - correlated studies . in an optical lattice simulator , for example , tunable inhomogeneous potentials may be created by projective methods  @xcite , and global addressing via laser - assisted tunneling  @xcite may be used to reintroduce site - to - site coupling in a link - dependent fashion , allowing local control over tunneling amplitudes and phases .",
    "lastly , as a natural consequence of developing a new atom optics - based system for simulating coherent transport phenomena , the atom optics toolset will be expanded to include unique new capabilities for the manipulation of atomic matter waves .",
    "we thank taylor hughes for helpful conversations , and brian demarco for helpful conversations and comments .",
