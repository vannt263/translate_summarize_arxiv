    "the recent isolation of graphene layers a single atom thick@xcite has lead to a great deal of activity , because of their novel electronic properties and potential applications .",
    "the lattice structure of graphene is determined by the @xmath4 coordination between neighboring carbon atoms .",
    "each carbon atom has three nearest neighbors , leading to planar honeycomb lattice . with small modifications ,",
    "the same structure describes other carbon allotropes , such as the fullerenes and the carbon nanotubes .",
    "in this paper we study the simplest systems which combine two of these allotropes : the junctions between a single graphene layer and carbon nanotubes .",
    "a regular array of closely spaced armchair nanotubes attached to a graphene layer has already been studied@xcite , and related systems are being considered for their potential applications@xcite .",
    "we undertake here the investigation of junctions made of nanotubes with different chiralities , which have in common a transition from the planar to the tubular geometry mediated by the presence of six heptagonal carbon rings .",
    "these induce the negative curvature needed to bend the honeycomb carbon lattice at the junction , playing a kind of dual role to that of the pentagonal carbon rings in the fullerene cages@xcite .",
    "we analyze first the electronic properties of a single junction between a carbon nanotube and a graphene layer .",
    "we discuss the possible structures of this type , concentrating on geometries where the heptagonal rings are evenly spaced around the junction .",
    "the nanotubes can be then either armchair @xmath0 or zig - zag with @xmath5 geometry ( that is , with @xmath6 hexagonal rings around the tube ) .",
    "we calculate their electronic structure , using the tight - binding model based on the @xmath7 orbitals of the carbon atoms widely applied to carbon allotropes with @xmath4 coordination .    paying attention to the local density of states , we find that the junctions fall into two different classes , depending on the behavior in the low - energy regime .",
    "one of the classes , comprising the junctions made of armchair and @xmath5 nanotubes when @xmath2 is a multiple of 3 , is characterized by the presence of a peak in the density of states close to the fermi level .",
    "the peak is absent in the other class , formed by the junctions made with the rest of zig - zag geometries . in general",
    ", the density of states tends to be depleted in the junction at low energies , with peaks above and below the fermi level marking the threshold for the propagation of new states across the junction .",
    "we present next a continuum description , based on the formulation of dirac fermion fields in the curved geometry , which allows us to characterize the general properties of the junction , and which is consistent with the previous discrete analysis .",
    "thus , we see that the peak at the fermi level in the local density of states is in general a reflection of the existence of quasi - bound states ( zero modes ) for the dirac equation in the curved space of the junction . it is known that the topological defects of the honeycomb lattice ( pentagonal and heptagonal rings ) induce an effective gauge field in the space of the two dirac points of the planar graphene lattice@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the effective magnetic flux is enough to localize two states at the junctions made of armchair or @xmath5 nanotubes when @xmath2 is a multiple of 3 . at low energies ,",
    "however , the generic behavior is given by evanescent states , which arise from the matching of modes with nonvanishing angular momentum and have exponential decay in the nanotube .",
    "we finally apply our computational framework to the analysis of the band structure of the arrays of nanotube - graphene junctions . considering the behavior of the low - energy bands close to the fermi level , we find that the arrays also fall into two different classes .",
    "the arrays made of armchair nanotubes or @xmath5 nanotubes with @xmath2 equal to a multiple of 3 tend to have a series of flat bands close to the fermi level , while the arrays made with the rest of zig - zag nanotubes have all the bands dispersing at low energies .",
    "such a different behavior has its origin in the existence of states confined in the nanotube side of the junction .",
    "we find that this feature can also be explained in the context of the continuum model .",
    "the armchair and the @xmath5 geometries with @xmath2 equal to a multiple of 3 allow for the formation of standing waves between the junction and the other end of the tube .",
    "this is the mechanism responsible for the confinement of the states in the nanotubes and the consequent development of the flat bands , whose number grows at low energies with the length of the nanotube , in agreement with the predictions of the continuum theory .",
    "our first aim is to analyze the density of states of a semi - infinite nanotube attached to a graphene layer in the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the possible setups that we will consider , keeping the threefold coordination of the carbon atoms , are sketched in fig .",
    "the structures can be wrapped by the graphene hexagonal lattice , with the exception of the six points where the sides of the hexagonal prism ( which describes the nanotube ) intersect the plane .",
    "the threefold coordination of the carbon atoms requires the existence of sevenfold rings at those positions .     + ( a ) ( b ) ( c )    we describe the electronic states in the structures shown in fig .",
    "[ one ] by means of a nearest - neighbor tight - binding model . in general the relaxation of elastic energy will modify the bond lengths at the junction , depending on the nanotube radius .",
    "we will assume that this relaxation does not change significantly the electronic behavior . in this respect ,",
    "a tight - binding model based on the @xmath8 carbon orbitals is well - suited for the purpose of discerning the extended or localized character of the different electronic states .",
    "our main achievement will be to assign the different features in the local density of states to the behavior of the electronic states near the nanotube - graphene junctions .",
    "to this aim , we have actually checked that slight modulations of the transfer integral @xmath9 near the junctions do not produce significant changes in the results shown in what follows .",
    "we concentrate on the analysis of geometries where the six heptagonal carbon rings are evenly spaced around the junction as in fig .",
    "this constrains the possible chiralities of the nanotubes , that can be then either armchair @xmath0 or zig - zag @xmath1 , with the number @xmath2 running over all the integers .",
    "nanotubes in which the carbon sheet is wrapped with helicity can be also attached at the expense of introducing an irregular distribution of the heptagonal rings .",
    "anyhow , we expect that the rules explaining the different features in the density of states are universal enough to hold even in these more general cases",
    ".    we have obtained the spectra of different types of hybrid structures by diagonalization of the tight - binding hamiltonian for very large lattices , with up to @xmath10 carbon atoms in the graphene part and @xmath11 in the nanotube side .",
    "given that the whole geometry has @xmath3 symmetry , we have classified the energy eigenstates into six groups according to the eigenvalue @xmath12 under a rotation of @xmath13 . the nature of each electronic state is given in general by its behavior at the nanotube - graphene junction .",
    "for this reason , we have characterized the hybrid structures in terms of the local density of states averaged over a circular ring of atoms at the end of the nanotube close to the junction .",
    "our computations have covered a number of structures including armchair and zig - zag nanotubes with different radii .",
    "after inspection of all the spectra , it becomes clear that there are several generic features in the density of states .",
    "we have represented in fig . [",
    "two ] the behavior near the junction between a graphene layer and a ( 54,0 ) zig",
    "- zag nanotube .",
    "we observe that , apart from the peak close to zero energy in the sectors corresponding to @xmath14 , for @xmath15 there is always a depletion in the density of states at low energies , delimited by two abrupt upturns .",
    "it is remarkable that the pattern in the sectors corresponding to @xmath16 reproduces the same observed for @xmath14 , but with a scale that is approximately twice larger .",
    "the density of states in the sector with @xmath17 displays in turn a wider depletion , with the position of the peaks scaled by an approximate factor of 3 with respect to those in the @xmath14 sectors .",
    "+ ( a ) ( b ) +   +   + ( c ) ( d )    in the above behavior of the density of states , the appearance of the peak close to zero in the sectors with @xmath14 is the only feature not generic for all kinds of nanotubes . in the junctions made with zig - zag nanotubes , the peak actually appears for nanotube geometries of the type @xmath5 when @xmath2 is a multiple of 3 .",
    "in this series of hybrid structures , the patterns in the density of states for each value of @xmath12 are quite similar , with the position of the corresponding peaks scaled in proportion to the radius of the nanotube . on the other hand ,",
    "the rest of junctions , for which @xmath2 is not a multiple of 3 , display a different behavior .",
    "we have represented in fig .",
    "[ three ] the local density of states averaged over a ring of atoms at the end of a @xmath18 nanotube close to the junction .",
    "it can be observed the depletion of the density of states at low energies in all but one of the @xmath12-sectors , and the absence of a peak at zero energy in any of the sectors .",
    "the local density of states of the @xmath18 nanotube is dominated at the junction by contributions from states with @xmath16 , and this has to do with the fact that the lowest - energy subbands of a @xmath5 zig - zag nanotube have a nonvanishing angular momentum equal to @xmath19 for the motion around the tubule .",
    "this corresponds to a quantum number @xmath20 in the case of the @xmath18 nanotube , while the low - energy states have @xmath21 in the @xmath22 nanotube .",
    "the present picture becomes then consistent with the fact that states in higher subbands may propagate across the junction only above ( or below ) some threshold energy .",
    "this feature will be established more precisely in the continuum approach derived below in terms of the dirac equation .     + ( a ) ( b ) +   +   + ( c ) ( d )    at this point , the hybrid structures can be classified into two different groups , depending on whether there is a peak or not close to zero energy in the local density of states around the nanotube - graphene junction .",
    "the peak comes actually from the contribution of a doubly degenerated level with states having @xmath14 , and whose probability distribution decays exponentially in the nanotube .",
    "the character of these states will be established in the next section , after developing the continuum limit in terms of dirac fermion fields .",
    "the evidence for the two different classes of hybrid structures is reinforced by the fact that the junctions made with armchair nanotubes behave in a quite similar way to that shown by the @xmath5 nanotubes when @xmath2 is a multiple of 3 .",
    "the local density of states averaged over a circular ring of atoms around the junction between a @xmath23 nanotube and a graphene layer has been represented in fig . [",
    "we observe the presence of the peak close to zero energy in the sectors with @xmath14 .",
    "there is a clear depletion in the local density of states at low energies except in the sector with @xmath21 , which is consistent with the fact that the lowest - energy subbands in the armchair nanotube correspond to zero angular momentum around the tubule .",
    "+ ( a ) ( b ) +   +   + ( c ) ( d )    the existence of the two different classes of nanotube - graphene junctions is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ five ] , which shows the results for the local density of states around the junction ( after summing over the sectors with different values of @xmath12 ) for the different types of nanotube considered above .",
    "it is remarkable the similarity between the density of states for the @xmath24 and @xmath23 nanotube geometries , which have a very close value of the radius .",
    "this suggests that there must be a universal way of understanding the low - energy electronic properties of the two different classes of junctions , independent of the details of the lattice building the junction within each class .",
    "+ ( a ) ( b ) +   +   + ( c ) ( d )",
    "we observe that the density of states summed over all values of @xmath12 tends to have an approximate linear behavior away from the very low energy regime .",
    "this motivates the analysis of the junction in terms of the dirac equation in the hybrid geometry , as the dirac fermions provide an appropriate description of the electronic properties in the 1d carbon nanotube as well as in the 2d graphene layer .",
    "we will then assume that the radius @xmath25 of the nanotube is much larger than the graphene lattice constant , in order to obtain the continuum limit of the tight - binding model .",
    "within this approximation , the analysis of the electronic structure is reduced to the study of the dirac equation in a space with an abrupt change from a planar to a cylindrical structure . the transition from a geometry to the other takes place due to the presence of the six heptagonal rings at the junction .",
    "these defects are the source of negative curvature , playing a role opposite to that of the pentagonal rings in a fullerene cage@xcite .",
    "the heptagons , as well as the pentagons , also induce frustration in the honeycomb lattice , and lead to the exchange of the two dirac valleys of the planar geometry@xcite .",
    "this latter effect has to be accounted for by means of an effective non - abelian gauge field operating in the space of the two independent dirac points of graphene .",
    "it can be shown that the effective flux associated to an individual heptagonal ring is equal to @xmath26 @xcite ( in units such that @xmath27 ) .",
    "the flux provided by the six heptagons at the junction can reach therefore a maximum of 3/2 times the flux quantum .",
    "in general , however , the count of the total flux may not follow an additive rule , so that it can be lower than the maximum value , depending on the relative position of the heptagonal rings@xcite .",
    "we will see that this is actually the origin of the two different classes of junctions .",
    "note that the angular momentum around the axis of the nanotube is conserved and quantized in integer units , in a continuum description of the geometry analyzed here . on the other hand ,",
    "the angular momentum in the plane is quantized and shifted by @xmath28 plus the number of flux quanta of the effective gauge field induced by the heptagonal rings .",
    "the existence of topological defects which induce an effective flux at the junction allows us to match wavefunctions with different angular momenta at either side of the junction , provided that the effective flux corresponds to a half - integer number of quanta .      by looking at the effect of pairs of heptagonal rings ,",
    "the non - abelian gauge field operating in the space of the two dirac points becomes anyhow proportional to a sigma matrix @xmath29 .",
    "we may consider then that the effect of the six heptagonal rings at the junction is described by an effective abelian field , standing for either of the eigenvalues of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we end up therefore with two different dirac equations , with effective magnetic fluxes of opposite sign .",
    "we will denote the dirac spinors satisfying the two dirac equations as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "given that the region of the space away from the junction has no curvature , we can use radial coordinates @xmath32 to write the set of two dirac equations in the plane for @xmath33 : @xmath34 @xmath35 is the fermi velocity and the components @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the respective amplitudes of the electron in the two sublattices of the graphene lattice .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 corresponds to the quanta of effective flux felt by the electrons when making a complete tour around the junction .    in the nanotube side ,",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "the dirac equation for the nanotube is @xmath41    we note that ( [ dp1])-([dp2 ] ) as well as ( [ dn1])-([dn2 ] ) are expressions of the dirac equation in flat space .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that , in the continuum limit , the curvature is localized at the circle connecting graphene and the nanotube . as an alternative to the coordinate @xmath42",
    ", we could make for instance the change of variables @xmath43 , allowing us to map the nanotube into the region of the plane with @xmath44 .",
    "using a common radial coordinate @xmath45 to describe both graphene and the nanotube , the metric of the space turns out to be multiplied by the conformal factor @xmath46 .",
    "the first derivative of the metric becomes then discontinuous and the curvature scalar , computed in terms of second derivatives of the metric , is @xmath47 .",
    "the integral of this expression corresponds actually to the total curvature provided by the heptagonal rings .",
    "this makes clear that the effects of the curvature are implicit in the operation of matching the solutions of ( [ dp1])-([dp2 ] ) and ( [ dn1])-([dn2 ] ) at the circle @xmath48 .    the solutions of the eqs .",
    "( [ dp1])-([dp2 ] ) are of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are bessel functions .",
    "the energy is @xmath54 .    on the other hand , the resolution of eqs .",
    "( [ dn1])-([dn2 ] ) shows that there are propagating and evanescent waves in the nanotube , which can be written as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are constants , the energy @xmath58 is given by : @xmath59 and the phase factor in eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) is : @xmath60    we note that the evanescent states with longitudinal decay @xmath61 arise for nonvanishing angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "then there is an energy threshold @xmath62 for the appearance of propagating states in the nanotube .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the behavior of the local density of states obtained for the different values of @xmath12 in the tight - binding approach .",
    "the depletion found in different @xmath12-sectors for the local density of states at the end of the nanotube ( close to the junction ) corresponds actually to the range of evanescent states given by ( [ e ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the position of the peaks delimiting the depletion in the tight - binding approach scales in proportion to the value of the angular momentum , which corresponds in the lattice to the different values of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , we have also seen that such a position is inversely proportional to the nanotube radius @xmath25 , with values in the plots that can be approximately matched with the estimate @xmath63 ( after using the expression of the fermi velocity @xmath64 , in terms of the transfer integral @xmath9 and the c - c distance @xmath65 ) .",
    "we find therefore that the generic features found for the local density of states in the tight - binding approach are well captured by the continuum limit based on the dirac equation .",
    "the presence of a peak in the local density of states close to zero energy ( in the sectors @xmath66 ) is the only feature not generic for all types of nanotubes , and that can be also explained within our continuum approach .",
    "the rotation caused by each heptagonal ring in the space of the two dirac points corresponds to an effective magnetic flux of @xmath26 @xcite , but the way this flux is combined in the case of pairs of heptagons depends on their relative position .",
    "this has been studied in the case of pentagon pairs in ref .",
    ", arriving at a conclusion that can be readily generalized to the case of heptagonal defects .",
    "the result is that , when the distance between the heptagons is given by a vector @xmath67 ( using the same notation to classify the nanotubes ) such that @xmath68 is not a multiple of 3 , the effective flux of a pair of heptagons does not add to @xmath8 , but to the lower amount @xmath13 .",
    "the number @xmath68 for the distance between heptagons is a multiple of 3 only in the case of junctions with armchair nanotubes , or with @xmath1 nanotubes when @xmath2 is a multiple of 3 . in these instances ,",
    "the total flux felt around the junction is equal to the sum of the fluxes provided by the individual heptagons , giving a value of @xmath69 . in the rest of the cases",
    ", the total flux corresponds instead to @xmath70 .",
    "the number @xmath38 of flux quanta has a direct correspondence with the number of zero modes of the dirac equation .",
    "their existence rests on the possibility of having localized states at the junction , with suitable decay in both the graphene part and the nanotube side .",
    "if we take for instance the maximum effective flux and @xmath69 , we have an equation for a zero - energy eigenstate in the region @xmath71",
    "@xmath72 for a wavefunction with angular momentum @xmath2 , we obtain the behavior @xmath73 this gives rise to modes decaying from the junction for values @xmath74 .",
    "the wavefunction has to be matched at @xmath48 with the appropriate dependence in the nanotube , that is @xmath75 recalling that @xmath40 , we see that only the value @xmath76 provides a localized state at the junction . on the graphene side ,",
    "the state is not strictly normalizable , in a similar way to other half - bound states induced by defects@xcite .",
    "anyhow , such a localized state has a reflection in the peak observed close to zero energy in the @xmath14 sectors of the tight - binding density of states . by inverting the direction of the flux and taking @xmath77",
    ", it can be seen that the solutions have then a nonvanishing component @xmath78 similar to ( [ zm ] ) , but with angular momentum @xmath79 instead of @xmath2 .",
    "another localized state is found therefore with opposite chirality and @xmath80 .    in the case of the junctions with @xmath1 nanotubes such that @xmath2 is not a multiple of 3 ,",
    "the flux corresponding to @xmath70 is not enough to localize states at the junction .",
    "it can be seen that there are no zero - energy solutions of the dirac equation decaying simultaneously in the graphene plane and in the nanotube .",
    "this explains why in this type of junctions there is no low - energy peak within the depleted region of the local density of states .",
    "we complete in this way the correspondence between the tight - binding approach and the continuum limit based on the dirac equation , accounting for the main electronic features and unveiling also the origin of the different low - energy behavior in the two classes of junctions .",

[ eight](a ) are not affected however by variations of that variable , while they move instead closer to the fermi level as the distance between the nanotubes in the array is increased .     + ( a ) ( b ) +   +   + ( c ) ( d )    on the other hand , the presence of flat bands at low energies is not generic in arrays made of zig - zag nanotubes . in general",
    ", we may expect a number of bands dispersing above and below the fermi level , as shown in figs . [",
    "eight](b ) and ( d ) , which represent the low - energy bands of arrays made respectively of @xmath149 and @xmath150 nanotubes . in the case of the zig - zag nanotubes ,",
    "flat bands only appear close to the fermi level when the junctions are formed with @xmath1 geometries such that @xmath2 is a multiple of 3 .",
    "this distinctive behavior can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ eight](c ) , which displays the low - energy bands in the case of an array made of @xmath24 nanotubes .",
    "the shape of the bands resembles there the typical appearance of the spectra of arrays made of armchair nanotubes , as shown in fig . [",
    "eight](a ) .",
    "the mentioned flat bands have their origin in the existence of localized states in the arrays of junctions .",
    "we have checked that the junctions made of armchair nanotubes and @xmath1 nanotubes with @xmath2 equal to a multiple of 3 have in common the formation of electron states confined mostly in the nanotube side .",
    "these are the states responsible for the development of the flat bands shown in fig .",
    "[ eight ] , as the wave functions with most of their weight in the nanotubes show little overlap in the graphene part of the lattice .",
    "this also explains in a natural way the proliferation of flat bands at low energies as the nanotube length is increased , by thinking of the confined modes as standing waves in the tube . on the other hand ,",
    "the states that are preferentially localized at the junctions ( corresponding to the quasi - bound states of the dirac equation ) may be identified here as the pairs of branches degenerated at the @xmath151 point .",
    "these states may have in general a significant overlap between nearest junctions , which is reflected in the appreciable dispersion of the corresponding bands .",
    "we can reach in the continuum limit a qualitative understanding of the similar behavior of the arrays made of armchair and @xmath1 nanotubes when @xmath2 is a multiple of 3 , by noticing that these are the only geometries that support low - energy standing waves between the junction and the other end of the tube .",
    "this requires the superposition of two modes with opposite momenta along the tube , which is possible at low energies in the armchair nanotubes as the modes at opposite dirac points have then vanishing angular momentum . in general",
    ", this is not the case for the @xmath1 geometries , since in the zig - zag nanotubes the dirac points correspond to large momenta in the transverse direction . yet",
    "the formation of standing waves is possible when @xmath2 is a multiple of 3 , as the low - energy states about the two dirac points fall then in the same sector with quantum number @xmath21 regarding the @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "thus , it is possible to form a state confined in the nanotube by superposition of two modes with opposite longitudinal momenta and the same quantum number @xmath12 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the confined states are actually found in the @xmath152 sector in the diagonalization of very large lattices of individual nanotube - graphene junctions . in the real lattice of the array ,",
    "the confinement of the electrons in the nanotubes is only approximate , but the decay of the wave functions in the graphene part away from the junctions is strong enough to account for the development of the flat bands shown above .",
    "in this paper we have studied the electronic structure of the hybrid material made of carbon nanotubes attached to a graphene sheet . by analyzing individual nanotube - graphene junctions ,",
    "we have found the following features :    \\i ) low - energy electrons in the graphene layer , with @xmath153 , are scattered by the nanotube , and the probability of propagating into the tube is small .",
    "\\ii ) high - energy electrons reaching the nanotube junction , with @xmath154 , are mostly transmitted into the nanotube .",
    "\\iii ) at low energies , @xmath153 , and in the vicinity of the junction , @xmath155 , there is in general a depletion of the density of states .",
    "\\iv ) in certain nanotube geometries ( armchair and @xmath1 with @xmath2 equal to a multiple of 3 ) , there are quasi - bound states near @xmath156 , partially localized at the junction .",
    "we have shown that these features can be accounted for in a continuum model of the hybrid geometry .",
    "this is based on the dirac fermion fields describing the electronic excitations , interacting with the curvature and the effective gauge field arising from the six heptagonal carbon rings at the junction .",
    "thus , properties i ) , ii ) and iii ) are intrinsic to the continuum dirac equation and universal for all nanotube geometries , while iv ) depends on the relative position of the six heptagonal rings and the consequent effective magnetic flux at the junction . while we have focused on the case of armchair and zig - zag nanotubes , it becomes clear that the continuum theory may account as well for the properties of junctions with other geometries . in this respect , it is likely that , by allowing for less regular distributions of the heptagonal rings , nanotubes with nontrivial helicity can also be attached to the graphene sheet . in a more general theoretical perspective , it may be interesting to analyze other discrete realizations of the 2d dirac equation , like the geometry of a square lattice with one half magnetic flux per plaquette .",
    "we have also shown that the arrays of nanotube - graphene junctions fall into two main classes , depending on whether their spectra exhibit or not flat bands close to the fermi level .",
    "the flat bands only appear in arrays made of armchair nanotubes or @xmath1 nanotubes when @xmath2 is a multiple of 3 . on the other hand",
    ", the semiconducting behavior seems to be a constant in the class characterized by the presence of the flat bands , as no dispersive bands cross then the fermi level .",
    "metallic behavior of the array of junctions is possible in the other class , as shown in fig .",
    "[ eight](b ) , though that behavior does not appear to be a generic trend , as illustrated by the absence of low - energy bands crossing the fermi level in the other representative of the class shown in fig .",
    "[ eight](d ) .    in real experimental samples",
    ", it is quite likely that the arrays may be formed by junctions with nanotubes of different helicities . in this case",
    ", we can expect that the electronic structure of these arrays will be a mixture of the features already present in figs . [",
    "eight](a)-(d ) .",
    "in particular , part of the electronic states will be still confined in some of the nanotubes , and other states will be partially localized at some of the junctions .",
    "the feasibility of using the arrays of nanotube - graphene junctions may depend on the possibility to tailor these hybrid structures to get specific functions . at this point ,",
    "more input from experimental measurements on these arrays would be required , while the remarkable behavior predicted for these systems ( localization and confinement of states , flat bands ) opens good perspectives in the investigation of novel electronic devices .",
