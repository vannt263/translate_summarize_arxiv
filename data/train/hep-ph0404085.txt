    "neutrino oscillations are entering a new era in which the observations from underground experiments obtained with neutrino beams provided to us by nature   either from the sun or from the interactions of cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere   are being confirmed by experiments using `` man - made '' neutrinos from accelerators and nuclear reactors  @xcite .    for atmospheric neutrinos , super  kamiokande ( sk ) high statistics data  @xcite established beyond doubt that the observed deficit in the @xmath3-like atmospheric events is due to the neutrinos arriving in the detector at large zenith angles , and it is best explained by @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "this evidence was also confirmed by other atmospheric experiments such as macro  @xcite and soudan 2  @xcite .",
    "the kek to kamioka long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment ( k2k ) uses an accelerator - produced neutrino beam mostly consisting of @xmath0 with a mean energy of 1.3  gev and a neutrino flight distance of 250  km to probe the same oscillations that were explored with atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "their results  @xcite show that both the number of observed neutrino events and the observed energy spectrum are consistent with neutrino oscillations , with oscillation parameters consistent with the ones suggested by atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "oscillations are not the only possible mechanism for atmospheric @xmath2 flavour transitions .",
    "they can also be generated by a variety of forms of nonstandard neutrino interactions or properties .",
    "in general these alternative mechanisms share a common feature : they require the existence of an interaction ( other than the neutrino mass terms ) that can mix neutrino flavours  @xcite . among others",
    "this effect can arise due to violations of the equivalence principle ( vep )  @xcite , non - standard neutrino interactions with matter  @xcite , neutrino couplings to space - time torsion fields  @xcite , violations of lorentz invariance ( vli )  @xcite and of cpt symmetry  @xcite . from the point of view of neutrino oscillation phenomenology",
    ", the most relevant feature of these scenarios is that , in general , they imply a departure from the @xmath4 energy dependence of the oscillation wavelength  @xcite .    prior to the highest - statistics",
    "sk data , some of these scenarios could provide a good description ",
    "alternative to @xmath5 neutrino oscillations   of the atmospheric neutrino phenomenology  @xcite . however , with more precise data , and in particular with the expansion of the energy range covered by atmospheric neutrino data due to the inclusion of the upward - going muons , these alternative scenarios became disfavoured as leading mechanism to explain the observations  @xcite .",
    "the results from k2k experiment further singled out oscillations as the dominant mechanism of @xmath6 transitions  @xcite . which allowed them to slightly improve the discrimination between oscillations and alternative mechanisms .",
    "unfortunately , to reproduce such analysis for the subdominant effects discussed here is not possible outside the collaboration . ]",
    "the question arises , however , to what point the possible presence of these forms of new physics , even if sub - dominant , may affect the derived ranges of masses and mixing from the oscillation analysis of the atmospheric and k2k data . or in other words , to what level our present determination of the neutrino masses and mixing is robust under the presence of phenomenologically allowed new physics effects .",
    "in this paper we address this question by performing a global analysis of the atmospheric and k2k data with @xmath2 transitions driven by neutrino masses and mixing in the presence of some generic forms of new physics .",
    "in particular we consider new physics interactions which are vector - like , or tensor - like ( scalar interactions can not be distinguish from oscillations ) .",
    "this allow us to treat , in a model independent way , effects due to the violation of the equivalence principle , violations of the lorentz invariance both cpt conserving and cpt violating , non - universal couplings to a torsion field and non - standard neutrino interactions in matter . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclu ] .",
    "the technical details of our new statistical analysis of the atmospheric data are described in the appendix .",
    "in what follows we consider some new physics ( np ) scenarios which induce new sources of lepton flavour mixing in addition to the `` standard '' @xmath5 oscillations ( @xmath5-osc ) .",
    "we concentrate on flavour mixing mechanisms for which the propagation of neutrinos ( @xmath7 ) and antineutrinos ( @xmath8 ) is governed by the following hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath5 is the mass  squared difference between the two neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath10 accounts for a possible relative sign of the np effects between neutrinos and antineutrinos and @xmath11 parametrizes the size of the np terms .",
    "the matrices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are given by : @xmath14 where we have also accounted for possible non - vanishing relative phases @xmath15 .",
    "for concreteness we will focus on np effects which are induced by tensor - like and vector - like interactions .",
    "we denote by tensor - like interactions those with @xmath16 leading to a contribution to the oscillation wavelength which grows linearly with the neutrino energy .",
    "for example , eq .   can describe the evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 s of different masses in the presence of violation of the equivalence principle ( vep ) due to non universal coupling of the neutrinos , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 being related to @xmath0 and @xmath1 by a rotation @xmath20 ) , to the local gravitational potential @xmath21  @xcite . ) with @xmath22 . ]",
    "phenomenology of neutrino oscillations induced or modified by vep has been widely studied in the literature  @xcite .    in this case @xmath23 for constant potential @xmath21 , this mechanism is phenomenologically equivalent to the breakdown of lorentz invariance induced by different asymptotic values of the velocity of the neutrinos , @xmath24 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being related to @xmath0 and @xmath1 by a rotation @xmath25  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath26    we denote by vector - like interactions those with @xmath27 which induce an energy independent contribution to the oscillation wavelength .",
    "this may arise , for instance , from a non - universal coupling of the neutrinos , @xmath28 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 being related to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 by a rotation @xmath29 ) , to a space - time torsion field @xmath30  @xcite , so @xmath31 violation of cpt due to lorentz - violating effects also lead to an energy independent contribution to the oscillation wavelength  @xcite with @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the eigenvalues of the lorentz violating cpt - odd operator @xmath34 and @xmath25 is the rotation angle between the corresponding neutrino eigenstates and the flavour eigenstates  @xcite .    in all these scenarios ,",
    "if the np strength is constant along the neutrino trajectory , the expression of @xmath35 takes the form  @xcite : @xmath36 where the correction to the @xmath5-osc wavelength , @xmath37 , and to the global mixing angle , @xmath38 , verify @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the ratio between @xmath5induced and the np  induced contributions to the oscillation wavelength @xmath41 for @xmath42 the same expressions hold with the exchange @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    for the sake of simplicity , in what follows we concentrate in scenarios with one np source characterized by a unique @xmath45 . in this case @xmath46      \\label{eq : xi }      \\mathcal{r } & = \\sqrt{1 + r_n^2 + 2 r_n \\left ( \\cos 2\\theta \\cos 2\\xi_n        + \\sin 2\\theta \\sin 2\\xi_n \\cos\\eta_n \\right ) } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fig .",

    "the dashed and dotted lines give the distributions for @xmath5-osc+np scenarios for @xmath16 and @xmath27 with @xmath50 and @xmath51  gev respectively . in both cases @xmath52 and the oscillation parameters have been set to their best fit values.,width=432 ]    in order to properly define the intervals of variation of the five parameters @xmath5 , @xmath53 , @xmath11 , @xmath54 , @xmath15 , we can take advantage of the symmetries of the hamiltonian ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a very similar problem ) . for a given value of @xmath55 , from the expressions   and",
    "we see that the hamiltonian is invariant under the following transformations :    * @xmath56 , * @xmath57 , * @xmath58 , * @xmath59 , * @xmath60 , * @xmath61 .    furthermore , the relevant survival probabilities @xmath62 and @xmath42 are not affected by a change in the overall sign of the hamiltonian , as well as change in the global phase of its non - diagonal components .",
    "therefore , we also have :    * @xmath63 , * @xmath64 , * @xmath65 .",
    "the above set of symmetries allows us to define the ranges of variation of the five parameters as follows : @xmath66 thus in the general case we cover the mixing parameter space by using , for instance , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    for the case of real relative phase , @xmath69 , one can absorb the two values of @xmath15 into the sign of @xmath54 . in this case",
    "we drop @xmath70 and replace @xmath71 by : @xmath72 and use instead @xmath73 .",
    "finally we notice that the above derivation is valid for a given sign of @xmath55 . keeping the convention of @xmath74 and",
    "@xmath75 the survival probability for the opposite sign can be obtained by the exchange @xmath76    in addition , we also consider the special case of vector - like np due to non - standard neutrino - matter interactions ( nsi )  @xcite . in this case",
    "the effective lagrangian describing the evolution of the @xmath0@xmath1 system can be written as  @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number density of the fermion @xmath79 along the path @xmath80 of the neutrinos propagating in the earth , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 parametrize the deviation from standard neutrino interactions : @xmath83 is the forward scattering amplitude of the fc process @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the difference between the @xmath86 and the @xmath87 elastic forward scattering amplitudes .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes for antineutrinos are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the interactions for neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same , which implies @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "thus the nsi hamiltonian contains three real parameters , which can be chosen to be @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "nsi and their interplay with the oscillations have also been studied in different contexts : among others , in relation to supernova neutrinos  @xcite , to the solar neutrino problem  @xcite , to the lsnd results oscillation results  @xcite , to neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite , and to present and future laboratory neutrinos  @xcite .    formally eq .",

    "consequently the flavour transition probability can not be simply read from eq .   and its evaluation requires the numerical solution of the neutrino evolution in the earth matter . in our calculations we use prem  @xcite for the earth s density profile and a chemical composition with proton / nucleon ratio @xmath97 in the mantle and 0.468 in the core",
    ". in what follows for the sake of concreteness we set our normalization on these parameters by considering that the relevant neutrino interaction in the earth occurs only with down ",

    "several comments are in order .",
    "first , from the figures we see that the best fit point for the global @xmath5-osc+np scenarios is always very near the best fit point of pure @xmath5-osc @xmath123 in other words , the data does not show any evidence of presence of np even as a sub - dominant effect .",
    "second , in agreement with sk analysis  @xcite , we find that with the inclusion of the three - dimensional atmospheric fluxes and improved cross sections as well as with the reanalyzed data points from sk , the best fit point and corresponding allowed regions from the atmospheric+k2k neutrino analysis is shifted to slightly lower values of @xmath5 compared to our previous analysis corresponding to the same data set  @xcite .",
    "third , the figures illustrate the robustness of the allowed ranges of mass and mixing derived from the analysis of atmospheric and k2k data under the presence of these generic np effects .",
    "fourth the analysis allow us to derive well - defined upper bounds on the np strength .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : atmnp ] we see that the bounds on the np strength parameter @xmath11 tightens for larger values of @xmath54 , being this effect stronger for np effects leading to sub - dominant oscillations with stronger energy dependence . in particular , for @xmath16 the bound on @xmath11 for @xmath124 is a factor @xmath125 stronger than that for @xmath126 , while for @xmath27 the variation of the bound on @xmath11 with @xmath54 is at most a factor @xmath127 .",
    "this behaviour can be qualitatively understood by studying the modification of the oscillation probability at the best fit point of oscillations , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , due to np effects : @xmath130      & \\hspace{5 mm } \\times \\frac{\\sin^2 \\left(\\phi_b \\sqrt{1       + 2 r_{n , b}\\ , \\sin 2\\xi_n \\cos\\eta_n + r_{n , b}^2 } \\right ) }      { 1 - \\sin^2\\phi_b } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the @xmath5 oscillation phase at the best fit point and @xmath132 is the ratio of np to the standard oscillation contributions evaluated at the best fit point of oscillations .    from eq .",
    "we find that as long as @xmath133 is small the dependence of @xmath134 on @xmath135 ( and consequently on @xmath11 ) is stronger for larger values of @xmath136 , which explains the tightening of the bound on @xmath11 .",
    "this behaviour was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case with @xmath16 .    however , it is worth noticing that the characteristic value of @xmath133 for which np effects are relevant depends on @xmath45 since as @xmath45 increases the effect becomes important only for higher values of @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zenith ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the characteristic @xmath133 for @xmath27 is larger than for @xmath16 .",
    "numerical inspection of eq .   also shows that the variation of the dependence of @xmath134 on @xmath135 with @xmath137 decreases as @xmath133 increases .",
    "this explains the milder dependence of the bound on @xmath11 with the mixing angle @xmath137 for @xmath27 as compared with the @xmath16 case .",
    "the figure also illustrates that imposing that the hamiltonian is real does not substantially affect these conclusions .",

    "<S> we study the robustness of the determination of the neutrino masses and mixing from the analysis of atmospheric and k2k data under the presence of different forms of phenomenologically allowed new physics in the @xmath0@xmath1 sector . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on vector and tensor - like new physics interactions which allow us to treat , in a model independent way , effects due to the violation of the equivalence principle , violations of the lorentz invariance both cpt conserving and cpt violating , non - universal couplings to a torsion field and non - standard neutrino interactions with matter . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a global analysis of the full atmospheric data from ski together with long baseline k2k data in the presence of @xmath2 transitions driven by neutrino masses and mixing together with sub - dominant effects due to these forms of new physics . </S>",
    "<S> we show that within the present degree of experimental precision , the extracted values of masses and mixing are robust under those effects and we derive the upper bounds on the possible strength of these new interactions in the @xmath0@xmath1 sector . </S>"
