    "the main goal here is to consider the most general case with @xmath1 complex ( @xmath26 ) , evaluate the non - elementary integral @xmath27 , and thus make possible the use of the ftc to compute the definite integral    @xmath28    for any @xmath29 and @xmath30 . and once ( [ i ] ) is evaluated , then integrals such as ( [ i1 ] ) , ( [ i2 ] ) , ( [ i3 ] ) , ( [ i4 ] ) can also be evaluated .",
