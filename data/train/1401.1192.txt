    "the perturbative approach in qcd ( pqcd ) is known to work well at high momenta ( @xmath4 ) . however , at low momenta ( @xmath5 ) it is unreliable , principally because the pqcd coupling parameter @xmath6 has ( landau ) singularities at spacelike low momenta @xmath7 : @xmath8 .",

    "<S> we incorporate the nonperturbative effects by making the ( noninteger ) powers of the qcd coupling in the dressing function @xmath0 analytic ( holomorphic ) via the fractional analytic perturbation theory ( fapt ) model , and simultaneously introducing the gluon dynamical mass in the propagator as motivated by the previous analyses of the dyson - schwinger equations . </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that the removal of the unphysical landau singularities of the powers of the coupling via the ( f)apt prescription , in conjunction with the introduction of the dynamical mass @xmath3 gev of the gluon , leads to an acceptable behavior of the propagator in the infrared regime . </S>"
