    "a particularly good scenario for modelling the interlocking of reproduction and cooperation is given by the possibility , considered recently @xcite , that bacteria living in colonies may be able to regulate the rate at which their genetic material mutates through the use of _ quorum sensing _ , a cooperative social effect that has been characterised in detail in the context of gene expression @xcite .",
    "we can model this situation in an elementary way by considering a population consisting of two types of bacteria @xmath0 and @xmath1 having similar survival and reproductive abilities .",
    "types @xmath0 and @xmath1 may change into one another through mutations , that may come about due to the persistent chemical interactions in which the genetic material is involved . in this context ,",
    "the existence of dna repairing processes @xcite may render unmutated individuals mechanistically prone to revert mutants to their original form , thus making cooperation an integral part of the mutation process .",
    "this modelling approach involves very strong assumptions on the nature of the bacterial life - cycles ( which are assumed to be completely uniform ) , the dependence on the environment ( which is neglected ) , and on population size and structure ( which are taken as fixed , and trivial , respectively ) .",
    "in addition to this , i ll also assume that rates of mutation are the same in both directions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "such an elementary setting allows to fully characterise the type of stochastic equilibrium attainable when both reproduction and cooperation are at work , and can be given both physical and biological interpretations .",
    "in physical terms , reproduction lends itself to be interpreted in terms of crystal growth , whereas mutations can be seen as configurational changes due to thermal noise , such as magnetic spin flips .",
    ".3 in      the process i want to consider is characterised diagrammatically by figure [ me ] , which represents the stochastic change in the number @xmath4 of bacteria of type @xmath0 present in the population during a given time interval .",
    "since the population size is kept fixed at a value @xmath5 , the number of bacteria of type @xmath1 is given by @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ process ] shows how the process can be built naturally as a superposition of the moran process of genetic drift ( fig .",
    "[ moran ] ) , and the glauber dynamics of a mean - field ferromagnet  ( fig . [ magnet ] ) .    at each time interval",
    "an individual is chosen to either live or die .",
    "if it dies , a new individual is immediately born by one of the survivors to take over the environmental spot just vacated .",
    "this is an elementary way to model a process of selection deriving from the presence of reproduction and death .",
    "+    whereas a birth always systematically follows every death , no deaths might happen during a given time interval : this has been called a  musical chairs \" type of process , since it bears analogies with children s playground game @xcite , and it has been shown that such inclusion of time intervals where no deaths happen gives a chance to model biological function , in a way that is reminiscent of the modelling of molecular activity in statistical thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the biological function that is interesting for the present case is the ability to repair damaged dna .",
    "when an individual does nt die , it keeps performing its metabolic processes .",
    "these may bring about mutations , and in particular mutations that may cause a change in the bacterial type , say from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "generally , when a mutation happens in an individual , several other unmutated individuals of the type a are left in the population . due to the existence of dna",
    "repairing processes @xcite , it s easy to envision ways in which unmutated bacteria of the original type @xmath0 may be prone to revert a mutant to its original form .",
    "this confers social dimension to the process of mutation , bringing it close to the standard interpretation of ferromagnetism , though putting the cooperative effect on firmer mechanistic grounds .",
    ".3 in      having established the structure of the process , its precise form is specified by choosing the transition probabilities in fig . [ me ] .",
    "i ll define the probabilities as follows , and justify them within the interpretation of the system as a bacterial population .",
    ".2 in    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     the factor @xmath7 is the typical transition probability for the glauber dynamics of a mean - field ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "however , whereas within statistical physics such factor is usually justified as the simplest choice which is consistent with the gibbs distribution @xcite , the process of dna repair provides a direct mechanistic justification for our choice of stochastic dynamics .",
    "we may in fact assume that an interaction between a mutant and a non - mutant may revert the mutant to its original type with probability @xmath8 .",
    "assuming the mutant s interactions with non - mutants to be independent events , this gives a probability @xmath9 that all interactions fail to revert the mutant .",
    "therefore , keeping in mind that the total number of type @xmath0 bacteria is equal to @xmath10 , we obtain ( [ mut ] ) for the probability that a mutation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 happens and is not repaired .",
    "if we now define the stochastic change in @xmath4 at a given interval @xmath11 as @xmath12 we can use inspection on fig . [ me ] to find the first two moments of @xmath13 , @xmath14 & = &    ( m_b + d_b \\ , b_a ) - ( m_a + d_a \\ ,",

    "having obtained @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the last section , we now can write down the equilibrium distribution @xmath19 for @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalisation constant that makes @xmath19 a probability distribution over the interval @xmath23 .",
    "this formula was derived for the wright population genetical process @xcite , where a whole biological population is regenerated at discrete time intervals ( usually called _ generations _ ) , and it has been shown to apply also to moran s random - walk equivalent of the former @xcite@xcite . the model i m considering can be seen as a variation on moran s , which , due to its single - step nature , lends itself to be modified in an intuitive way .    the process i m considering contains typical features of both biological and physical models : it is in fact useful to apply rescalings of the parameters typical of both disciplines , in order to identify the most interesting regimes attained by ( [ wright ] ) .",
    "it is common in population genetics to define a parameter @xmath24 : this corresponds to the fact that the rate of mutation of a genetic site @xmath25 is typically very small compared to the lifespan of an individual organism .",
    "mathematically , this rescaling prevents the law of large numbers from turning @xmath15 into a deterministic variable for large @xmath5 .",
    "we ll also make the typical assumption of mean field ferromagnetism , which in this case amounts to defining @xmath29 mathematically , we are assuming that @xmath30 is sufficiently close to @xmath31 for @xmath32 to stay away from zero at a relevant large @xmath5 , and this prevents the probability of mutation from vanishing , which would reduce the process to the one shown in fig .",
    "the meaning of @xmath33 is quite straightforward within the narrative of population biology : in a population consisting of only one type of organism , @xmath34 gives the probability that there does nt happen to be any repair event following a mutation event , and therefore it characterises the cooperative aspect of the process of mutation",
    ".    we can now apply our rescalings to @xmath17 and @xmath18 : notice in particular that the second term of @xmath18 is of order @xmath35 , so it can be safely neglected in our large @xmath5 expression of @xmath19 , which gives @xmath36       maximising the equilibrium distribution @xmath19 , as function of @xmath27 , for different values of @xmath34 .",
    "the diagram shows the transition from a minimum ( dashed line ) to a maximum ( solid line ) of the stationary point at @xmath40 only for the case @xmath41 , which corresponds to fig .",
    "3 . _ , width=15 ]            a convenient way to analyse this equation is to solve for @xmath27 as a function of @xmath49 , and see graphically how this function changes as a function of the interaction parameter @xmath34 : @xmath50    so equation ( [ modeeq ] ) can be used to construct the  mode diagram \" in fig .",
    "2 : points in this diagram correspond to maxima of the equilibrium @xmath19 .",
    "these points , however , are _ modes _ rather than thermodynamic _ phases _ since , due to our chosen scalings , the equilibrium @xmath19 remains stochastic in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figures [ lowinter ] and [ highinter ] , that show the shape of @xmath19 at increasing values of the mutation parameter @xmath27 for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the fact that the distribution does nt attain a deterministic limit for large @xmath5 is brought about by the presence of reproduction : in its absence a deterministic limit is attained , independently of the choice of scaling for the parameters . in practical terms , the absence of reproduction and death eliminates the term @xmath54 from @xmath18 , making it impossible for the ratio @xmath55 to remain bounded for large @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , the retainment of stochasticity in the thermodynamic limit shows that the gibbsian approach to the study of large systems is not applicable to the present case .",
    "the system however retains the main characteristic deriving from cooperation : figures  [ lowinter ] and [ highinter ] demonstrate how for @xmath56 -which corresponds to a high probability of dna repair events , due to strong bacterial interactions- two coexisting deterministic phases are attained in the limit @xmath57 , whereas only one is attained for @xmath58 . this fact can be easily derived analytically from eq .",
    "( [ modeeq ] ) , and it is also visible in fig .  [ modediagram ] , from how the curve corresponding to @xmath53 diverges to two horizontal asymptotes .",
    "we have that , in fact , @xmath19 admits bimodal regimes for any value @xmath59 .",
    "however for @xmath60 the bimodality is lost at a finite value of @xmath27 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ modediagram ] for the case  @xmath61 .",
    "we therefore have that the interlocking of cooperation and reproduction gives rise to an interesting kind of behaviour , that may remain stochastic even for systems of large size , and that shows a robust type of transition from low - mutation to high - mutation regimes through an intermediary state ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ lowinter](b ) ) , rather than the abrupt shift exhibited by typical models of population genetics  @xcite .",
    "the robustness of the resulting model offers a good testing ground for the idea suggested by the empirical evidence mentioned in the introduction , according to which the interplay between reproduction and cooperation may be a characterising feature of processes at work in a wide range of natural domains .",
