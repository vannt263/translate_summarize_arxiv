    "falls are a major health risk that impacts the quality of life of elderly people .",
    "when a fall occurs , a prompt notification would help in reducing the injuries that the fall could cause .",
    "an effective fall detection system should address the following requirements  @xcite : 1 ) automatic notification of occurred falls ; 2 ) promptness in order to provide quick help ; 3 ) reliability of the fall detection techniques ; 4 ) communication capabilities in order to alert the caregivers ; 5 ) usability in order to facilitating users acceptance .",
    "several solutions have been proposed : some of them addressing the problem as a whole , and others focusing on one specific requirement . the contribution of this article is related to the reliability of the fall detection techniques .",
    "several factors characterize a fall detection technique : from the sensors used to acquire data , to the features extracted ; from the algorithms used to detect falls , to the types of datasets used to train the algorithm .",
    "the approaches that have been proposed differ for the choices with respect to those factors .    for what concerns data acquisition ,",
    "ambient sensors , wearable sensors , or a combination of the two , are the principal data sources used in these techniques @xcite .",
    "many recent approaches investigate the possibility of using the sensors provided by smartphones  @xcite , which are widespread and require almost no installation or set - up .",
    "moreover , they do not introduce any additional cost , can be used in any place , and are accepted by end users because they are already part of their everyday life .",
    "the techniques also differ in the data type used to detect falls .",
    "most popular fall detection techniques exploit accelerometer data as the main input to discriminate between falls and activities of daily living ( adl ) .",
    "[ fig : accdata].a shows an example of accelerometer data representing a fall that are extracted from the dataset provided by  @xcite . in particular , the fall was recorded with a smartphone galaxy mini .",
    "[ fig : accdata].b illustrates the accelerometer data recorded by two sensors respectively placed on a galaxy s ii ( from the dataset by  @xcite ) and a galaxy nexus ( recorded by ourselves ) .",
    "these data capture the walk performed by two different subjects .",
    "it is possible to notice that the captured data share a general trend .",
    "this suggests the possibility of defining a method for the detection of falls that can be general and independent from the specific devices .    [",

    "in this work we evaluated the robustness of anomaly detectors ( _ one - class _ classifier ) compared to that of traditional _ two - classes _ detection methods that , in turn , are tuned with fall instances . to this end , we experimented several methods on three different collections of accelerometer data , and four different feature vectors .",
    "the experiments have demonstrated that :    * a very simple feature vector based on raw data is very robust to detect falls in both one or two classes schemas ; * a greater number of samples of acceleration instances penalises knn classification schemas . in contrast , the svm classifier does not seem to suffer from changes in the number of samples .",
    "this makes the one - class knn classifier more feasible in case of 51 samples ; * in the case of 128 samples a novelty detector is reliable only if it is based on raw data . in the case of 51 samples",
    "a novelty detector is reliable if it is based on both raw data and magnitude ;    overall , considering that in the case of raw data , the gap between the svm and one class knn is very small , we can conclude that a fall detection system based on a novelty detector is feasible in a real scenario .",
    "this is especially true considering the limited computation capacity and power resources of the smartphone .",
    "in fact , the raw data does not require further processing and the knn schema is based on a simple euclidean distance .",
    "in order to further validate the robustness of our approach , we should be able to experiment with additional datasets .",
    "these datasets should contain adl performed by different people and recorded by different smartphones .",
    "as the number of data sets freely available is extremely reduced , we decided to develop an application that is able to acquire data from smartphones sensors and to automatically label them ( falls or adl ) .",
    "this enables us to enrich the datasets of adl and of simulated falls .",
