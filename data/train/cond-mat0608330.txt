    "eigen model , which first considered that the evolution can be guided other than by chance , is the first mathematical model that makes darwin s idea of mutation and selection able to work in a simple and seemingly `` lifeless '' system of chemical reactants @xcite .",
    "two main points of the eigen model are about the quasispecies which is defined as a stationary distribution of genetically close sequences , centered around one or several master sequences , and the existence of an error threshold above which all information is lost because of accumulating erroneous mutations .",
    "the formation of quasispecies implies that the target of selection in quasispecies theory is not a single master sequence but a localized distribution in the sequence space .",
    "after leuthusser mapped eigen model on a well - known system in statistical mechanics the two dimensional ising system @xcite , the study of evolution has become easier and clearer @xcite .",
    "traditionally , people use the concentration of sequence @xcite or the mean fitness of population @xcite to measure the error threshold of evolution . but both of them just divide the copying fidelity into two regimes for sharp peak landscapes ( spl )",
    ". they ca nt distinguish the area near the threshold from the area far above the threshold .",
    "moreover , no in - depth results about how the sequence distribute in the sequence space has been gained in evolutionary study . here , we advance a different method by utilizing the variance of hamming distance of the sequences at a given generation to locate the error threshold of spl .",
    "the simulation shows clearly three distinct regimes of the copying fidelity .    today , pairwise sequence comparison is the most widely used application of bioinformatics because high sequence similarity usually implies structural , functional or evolutionary relationship among bio - molecular sequences @xcite . and",
    "the tool of complex network has been already brought in biological study @xcite .",
    "it offers unforeseen possibilities to uncover the organizing principles that govern the formation and evolution of complex systems .",
    "therefore , we also bring in another tool similarity network to study the eigen model .    during the evolution , we show that there are two jump discontinuities in the curve of the average of clustering coefficient @xmath5 of the network versus copying fidelity @xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon implies that the phase transition of the similarity network topology occurs just as we expected .",
    "so we prove that it is logical to study evolution by bringing in similarity network .",
    "we analyze the topology of the similarity networks established in three different areas of @xmath0 by two main basic measures , that is , the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient .",
    "and then we translate the results into biological language .",
    "thereby , we get a detailed result about how the sequences distribute in the sequence space . for comparison",
    ", we also present the results of the random sequences created according to the random selection principle ( select 3000 sequences randomly from @xmath6 sequences in the sequence space ) in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath7",
    ", we briefly introduce the eigen model . in section @xmath8 , we introduce the similarity network and explain how its inherent properties describe the distribution of sequences . in section @xmath9 , we study spl to put our ideas in practice and demonstrate how the sequences generated in spl distribute in the sequence space .",
    "at last we close our paper with concluding remarks in section @xmath10 .",
    "eigen model was established by eigen in 1971 .",
    "the original model was aimed at describing self - replicating rna or dna molecules with the assumptions as follows @xcite :    1 .",
    "the population of evolution is infinite .",
    "the individual is represented by a sequence of @xmath11 nucleotides @xmath12 , where @xmath13 contains four possible values to represent the four different bases in the rna or the dna molecules . but for simplicity , people usually take them to be binary variables which can be considered as distinguishing only between purines and pyrimidines .",
    "conventionally , @xmath13 is written in the binary form and @xmath14 is thus a binary string @xmath15 or equivalent to an integer @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "only point mutations are considered .",
    "then the mutation is an exchange of 0 and 1 on a certain locus . for the sake of mathematical tractability ,",
    "the point mutation rate @xmath18 ( @xmath0 is the copying fidelity of each position of the sequence ) is constant in time and independent of the position of sequence ( uniform error model ) .",
    "years later , eigen model has been developed to be applicable in a much wider area .",
    "for instance , the results for finite populations have been gained in both static fitness landscapes @xcite and dynamic fitness landscapes @xcite . and",
    "the error threshold of finite population @xmath19 may be lower than the infinite population s @xcite .",
    "thus , for simulated simplicity , we apply eigen model to finite population in this report .",
    "the equation describing the reproduction - mutation process is@xmath20 @xmath21 is the concentration of the @xmath22th sequence @xmath23 with normalization @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the probability of getting the sequence @xmath23 as the offspring of the replication of sequence @xmath26 and it is given by@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hamming distance between @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "the set of all sequences together with the hamming distance forms the sequence space . @xmath29",
    "named fitness is the reproduction rate of @xmath23 .",
    "it means that the sequence @xmath23 will reproduce @xmath29 offspring every evolution step .",
    "the fitness landscape is then obtained by assigning a numerical value @xmath29 to each point in the sequence space @xcite .",
    "the notion of  fitness landscape \" is one of the most powerful concept in evolutionary theory because evolutionary process could be considered as a random walk in it .",
    "a broad set of different fitness landscapes has been studied recently @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical work has focused on a particular fitness landscapes , that is , the sharp peak landscapes @xcite , in which there is a master sequence @xmath30 with larger fitness @xmath31 , while all other sequences have uniform fitness ( smaller than the master sequence ) . in mathematics , it could be expressed as ,    @xmath32=a_{0}$ ] and @xmath33=a_{1}<a_{0}$ ] for any @xmath34    ever since eigen found phase transition in spl almost 35 years ago , eigen s paper has generated substantial interest among the physicists .",
    "the error threshold , a minimal replication accuracy necessary to maintain the genetic information in the population , can be viewed as the critical point of a phase transition separating two regimes of the quasispecies evolution . above the error threshold ,",
    "the distribution of sequences is centered around the master sequence .",
    "below it , the outcome of a replication event can be considered a random sequence .",
    "this fact is well established through a great many of works @xcite .",
    "and the exact formulas for the threshold of ferromagnet and antiferromagnet in the spl are , @xmath35 @xmath36 ( see @xcite ) . the two equations here indicate that the threshold of ferrormagnet is close to 1 and the antiferromagnetic threshold is close to 0 for large @xmath11 . in order to prepare for studying the spl of eigen model ,",
    "the similarity network will be introduced in the next section .",
    "the study of complex networks has been initiated by a desire to understand various real systems @xcite .",
    "the complex networks can describe a wide range of systems in nature and society .",
    "the direct - viewing and obvious practical relevance enlighten us to apply this useful tool to the evolutionary study .",
    "a network is composed of a set of nodes and edges @xcite . in our similarity network ,",
    "the node i represents the sequence @xmath23 and every node is different from each other .",
    "if @xmath28 ( the hamming distance between @xmath23 and @xmath26 ) is no larger than the given hamming distance @xmath1 ( @xmath37 ) , we will connect node @xmath22 to node @xmath38 . by comparing all the sequences of population , an undirected complex network is then established @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the similarity network will become a complete network if @xmath1 is close to @xmath11 and there will be little edges in the network if @xmath1 is close to @xmath39 .",
    "the similarity network actually reflects the relationships between the sequences of population .",
    "it makes the study of the distribution of sequences easier and more vivid .    generally speaking",
    ", the topology of a network can be quantified by two main basic quantities .",
    "one quantity is the degree distribution , @xmath40 , giving the probability that a selected node has exactly @xmath41 links .",
    "the degree distribution allows us to distinguish among different classes of networks .",
    "it can offer us the approximate configuration about how sequences distribute in the sequence space .",
    "for example , it helps us to know whether the distribution is homogenous or not in the sequence space .",
    "the other one is the clustering coefficient , a measure of the cliquishness of a typical neighbourhood , defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of links among the @xmath44 nearest neighbors of node @xmath22 .",
    "people usually use the function @xmath2 and clustering coefficient @xmath3 of the network to measure the network s structure .",
    "@xmath2 is defined as the average clustering coefficient of all nodes with @xmath41 links .",
    "@xmath3 is the mean clustering coefficient over all nodes in the network ( @xmath45 , characterizing the overall tendency of nodes to form clusters .",
    "so the second quantity can picture the compactibility and the local property of the distribution of sequences .",
    "therefore , we use similarity network to illustrate in detail how the sequences distribute in the sequence space and what the relationship is among the sequences of population by calculating the degree distribution and clustering coefficient in the coming section .",
    "in this section , we will study the simple model , spl , to put our ideas in practice . the error threshold of spl will be located by utilizing the variance of hamming distance of the sequences at a given generation . besides , the distribution of sequences reproduced in this case will be characterized by analyzing the topology of the similarity network .    on computer simulation aspect ,",
    "we use a population of @xmath46 sequences with @xmath47 the total number of population , the length and the fitness of sequence are invariant in the process of simulation .",
    "the initial condition satisfies that the homogeneous population is made up of 3000 zeros at @xmath48 . because the sequence @xmath23 will reproduce @xmath29 offspring every evolution step , we need to choose 3000 sequences with the probability @xmath49 from the offspring after one replication step in order to keep the total number of sequences fixed , where @xmath43 is the number of sequence @xmath23 and @xmath50 is the total number of the offspring .",
    "now we begin to carry out our ideas .",
    "firstly , we calculate the variance of hamming distance of the sequences at a given generation to locate the error threshold and characterize how the configuration of the distribution varies with @xmath0 in the sequence space , on the whole .",
    "figure 1 shows the variance of hamming distance @xmath51 as a function of @xmath0 for spl where @xmath52 represents the average over 1000 evolution steps from @xmath53 to @xmath54 for the given @xmath0 .",
    "it has been proved that it is long enough for the evolution in the spl to balance at t=9000 for the @xmath0 chosen in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 represents statistical average over different kinds of the sequences at a given generation @xmath57 .",
    "the peaks of the curve in figure 1 locate at @xmath58 and @xmath59 , according well with the the theoretical values of threshold for the corresponding parameters , @xmath60 .",
    "the deflection of the threshold between theory and simulation may be caused by the finite size effect .",
    "the jump discontinuities locate at @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "let us take the ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath63 ) as an example to discuss the sharp peak landscapes .",
    "the curve of the ferromagnetic phase in figure 1 is distinctly made up of three portions , that is , the area above the threshold , near the threshold and below the threshold . in the area far below the threshold , the curve of @xmath64 varying with @xmath0 approximates to a horizontal line and its value is equal to @xmath65 it indicates that the configuration of the distribution far below the threshold is independent of @xmath66  in the area near the threshold , there is a peak and its amplitude will become large with the increase in @xmath11 .",
    "the existence of the peak reflects that the scattered band of the distribution is wide and how complicated the distribution of the sequences generated in this landscapes is . in the area far above the threshold",
    ", @xmath51 is close to 0 .",
    "it says that the distribution of sequences will converge in the sequence space if @xmath0 approaches to 1 .",
    "secondly , it is proved that it is logical to study the eigen model by bringing in similarity network .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath5 as a function of @xmath0 for spl where @xmath52 represents the average over 1000 evolution steps from @xmath53 to @xmath54 of the similarity network with @xmath67 for a given @xmath66 in figure 2 , there are two jump discontinuities at @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the same as those in figure 1 .",
    "we also have analyzed the other similarity networks with different hamming distance @xmath68 most of them give the same result when @xmath1 is not very large .",
    "this phenomenon confirms that the phase transition of the similarity network topology indeed occurs during the evolution just as we expected .",
    "so it is logical to study evolution by bringing in similarity network .",
    "thirdly , the distributions of the sequences generated in three areas are measured in depth by establishing similarity network .",
    "furthermore , the results of random sequences are presented for further analysis .",
    "figure 3 and figure 4 show respectively the degree distribution and the function @xmath2 of similarity networks for @xmath58 ( at the threshold ) and @xmath69 ( far below the threshold ) .",
    "figure 6(a ) and ( b ) show @xmath3 as a function of @xmath1 for the similarity networks established by the sequences generated at the threshold and by the random sequences , respectively .",
    "let us move on to analyze the topology of the similarity network to interpret the result of spl .",
    "near the threshold , @xmath70 is large ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "it shows that the similarity network of this case is compact , namely , the outcomes of the evolution in this case are genetically close to each other . in figure 3 , there is a relatively small number of nodes which possess a large number of links ( large degree ) but not large clustering coefficient ( @xmath2 is not large ) .",
    "they are known as hubs , which play the important role of bridging the many small communities of clusters into a single , integrated network .",
    "the presence of hubs suggests that the master sequence , the center in the distribution , exists assuredly in the quasispecies .",
    "moreover , the degree distributions are oscillating in figure 3(a ) and ( b ) and the oscillation amplitude will become small if the ratio of @xmath71 to @xmath72 increases .",
    "this phenomenon characterizes that there are several local optima around the center ( global optimum ) in the distribution of the sequences reproduced in the area near the threshold .",
    "it is more interesting that the curve of @xmath2 follows lognormal distribution ( see figure 3(c ) and ( d ) ) and the curve of @xmath3 versus @xmath1 appears as linear behaviour ( see figure 6(a ) ) .    far below the threshold",
    ", @xmath5 is small ( see figure 2 ) and the curve of @xmath5 varying with @xmath0 approximates to a horizontal line just as the curve of @xmath73 varying with @xmath0 dose .",
    "the degree distribution of the similarity network with @xmath74 follows gauss distribution in figure 4(a ) and the curve of @xmath2 of the same similarity network is close to a horizontal line in figure 4(b ) . for deeper discussion ,",
    "we introduce the random sequences created according to the random selection principle ( select 3000 sequences randomly from @xmath6 sequences in the sequence space ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the simulations of random sequences . for random sequences ,",
    "the value of @xmath64 could be obtained as follows .",
    "we consider the special case : since the random sequences distribute evenly in the sequence space , it is assumed that there are @xmath75 sorts of sequences in the population ( @xmath11 is the length of sequence ) .",
    "so,@xmath76 when n is large enough the equation ( [ equ5 ] ) approximates to @xmath77 in figure 1 , the simulation of @xmath64 of the sequences created in spl with @xmath69 is equal to @xmath78 ( correspond with the random sequences ) . in figure 5(a ) , the degree distribution of the similarity network with @xmath74 follows gauss distribution , the same as that in figure 4(a ) . in figure 5(b ) , the curve of @xmath2 of the same similarity network approximates to a horizontal line , the same as that in figure 4(b ) .",
    "all results indicate that both of the two similarity networks possess the random network topology .",
    "so , the outcomes of the evolution far below the threshold in spl are equivalent to the random sequences distributing evenly in the sequence space .    far above the threshold ,",
    "the similarity network is very compact which approximates to a complete network as @xmath5 is close to 1 no matter what the value of @xmath1 is ( @xmath37 ) in this case ( see figure 2 ) , implying that the sequences are highly similar to each other .",
    "the degree distribution and the function @xmath2 also give the same result .    to sum up , far below the threshold ,",
    "the values of both @xmath79 and @xmath5 are independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution is uniform in the sequence space . near the threshold ,",
    "the sequences have a large variance of hamming distance @xmath79 ( see figure 1 ) and a large clustering coefficient @xmath3 of the network ( see figure 2 ) , which implies that the scattered band of the distribution is wide and the cliques have formed in the distribution of sequences , respectively .",
    "so , we conclude that there are several local optima around the center ( global optimum ) in the sequence space . far above the threshold ,",
    "the sequences have a small variance of hamming distance @xmath79 ( see figure 1 ) but a large clustering coefficient @xmath3 of the network ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "so the range of the distribution will reduce to one point in the sequence space if q approaches to 1 .",
    "finally , it is more interesting that the curve of @xmath2 follows lognormal distribution ( see figure 3(c ) and ( d ) ) and the curve of @xmath3 versus @xmath1 appears as linear behaviour ( see figure 6(a ) ) near the threshold . by the way , the results of antiferromagnet are the same as that in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "in this paper , we have advanced two ways to study spl from a different perspective .",
    "one way is the curve of @xmath51 versus @xmath0 . it offers us a different avenue for accurately locating the error threshold .",
    "besides , this useful means not only shows how the configuration of the distribution varies with @xmath0 in the sequence space , but also divides the copying fidelity into three distinct regimes and makes a difference between the areas near the threshold and far above the threshold .",
    "the other one is the similarity network , offering a new avenue to describe the evolution .",
    "we have shown that there is a phase transition in the curve of @xmath5 versus @xmath0 for spl which proves that it is logical to apply similarity network to evolutionary study .",
    "then , we further investigate the distribution of sequences by measuring the topology of similarity network . and",
    "the results are listed as follows . far below the threshold ,",
    "the values of both @xmath79 and @xmath5 are independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution is uniform in the sequence space . near the threshold ,",
    "the sequences have a large variance of hamming distance @xmath79 and a large clustering coefficient @xmath3 of the network , which implies that the scattered band of the distribution is wide and the cliques have formed in the distribution of sequences , respectively .",
    "so , we have concluded that there are several local optima around the center ( global optimum ) in the sequence space .",
    "far above the threshold , the sequences have a small variance of hamming distance @xmath79 but a large clustering coefficient @xmath3",
    ". so the range of the distribution will reduce to one point in the sequence space if q approaches to 1 .",
    "finally , it has been found that @xmath2 follows lognormal distribution and the curve of @xmath3 versus @xmath1 is seen as a straight line near the threshold .",
    "our study first applies similarity network to study the eigen model .",
    "so , we hope that our work can be served as motivation and a source of inspiration for uncovering the mechanism of evolution .",
    "moreover , finding a suitable way to offer a bench mark for evaluating various fitness landscapes to estimate how the real - valued landscapes is on earth will be considered in forthcoming work .",
    "this paper was supported by the national science foundation of china under grant no . 10105007 ."
