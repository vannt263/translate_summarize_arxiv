    "in seminal studies of parker in mid 1960s , he proved that magnetized gas disk under the influence of a constant gravitational acceleration becomes unstable to long wavelength perturbations ( parker 1966 , 1967 ) . the instability named after parker",
    "was once thought to be the formation mechanism of giant molecular cloud complexes@xmath0(gmcs ) in the galaxy@xmath0(parker 1966 ; mouschovias 1974 ; appenzeller 1974 ; mouschovias et al .",
    "1974 ; blitz & shu 1980 ; shibata & matsumoto 1991 ; handa et al .",
    "this notion was based mostly on the results of stability analysis done in two dimensions , where only undular mode can be taken into account .",
    "many subsequent analyses done in three dimensions@xmath0(eg . , zweibel & kulsrud 1975 ; hughes & proctor 1988 ) , however , called our attention to the interchange mode , which may quickly drive the system convectively unstable .",
    "since the convection grows faster for shorter wavelength perturbations , it tends to shred the galactic ism disk into thin sheets of low density before the undular mode of long wavelength perturbations collects enough material to form well - defined large - scale structures near the midplane@xmath0(asso et al .",
    "1978 ; lachize - rey et al .",
    "to accept the classical parker instability as the formation mechanism of such galactic structures as the gmcs or the hi superclouds , one needs means to control the disruptive tendency of the interchange mode .",
    "the observed density in gmcs is about a few tens of hydrogen molecules per cubic centimeter . on the other hand ,",
    "three - dimensional mhd simulations of the parker instability in uniform and non - uniform external gravities render to the system only a factor 2 enhancement in density over its initial equilibrium value , which is far too low to generate interstellar clouds of even moderate density@xmath0(kim et al .",
    "1998 ; franco et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this low degree of density enhancement is one of the most serious obstacles the parker instability should overcome to be the gmc formation mechanism .    under canonical conditions of the galactic ism disk@xmath0(cf . ,",
    "spitzer 1978 ) , the classical parker instability driven by a uniform external gravity has the minimum growth time of @xmath110@xmath2 years and the corresponding length scale @xmath11.6@xmath0kpc , which are clearly incompatible with the gmc observations .",
    "it was in 1990 s that non - uniform models of gravity were tried out as a more realistic driving agent than the uniform one@xmath0(giz & shu 1993 ; kim & hong 1998 ) . by introducing a non - uniform external gravity , whose acceleration increases linearly with the vertical distance , @xmath3 , from the midplane up to @xmath4 500@xmath0pc and stays constant there on , one may reduce the time and length scales nominally to the degree compatible with the gmcs@xmath0(hong & kim 1997 ; kim & hong 1998 ) . however , the reduction of scales was not enough to give candidacy of the gmc formation mechanism back to the classical parker instability , because the reduced scale values are relevant for activities in the regions of high galactic altitudes , where vertical acceleration of the chosen external gravity becomes strongest but the gmcs do not generally reside .",
    "the undular mode of perturbations triggers the parker instability preferably in those disks , where magnetic field strength decreases rapidly with vertical distance , because it is easy for such disk to develop strong magnetic buoyancy @xmath0(parker 1955 ; hughes & proctor 1988 ) . under the uniform external gravity the field and density decrease with @xmath3",
    "exponentially ; while under the non - uniform external gravity they follow roughly a gaussian function of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is easier to trigger the parker instability under the non - uniform gravity than the uniform one .",
    "this is how a replacement of the external driving agent from the uniform to the non - uniform gravity has brought to the system a significant reduction in the time scale .",
    "however , the reduction of time scale does nt necessarily mean that dense condensations form near the midplane within a reasonably short period of time .",
    "it only means a quick development of diffuse chaotic features high above the central plane .",
    "this line of reasoning led us to replace the driving agent of the parker instability from the external gravity originated mostly from the galactic stars to the internal one of the ism itself .",
    "we expect the self gravity will ease the problem of low degree of density enhancement the classical parker instability faced .",
    "the self gravity would prevent the galactic ism disk from developing convective activities , while it would also activate the jeans gravitational instability preferably in the disk midplane . in this paper",
    "we will examine time , length and mass scales involved with the parker and the jeans instabilities in a magnetized gas disk under the self gravity .",
    "there have been many studies on the effect of magnetic fields upon the jeans gravitational instability .",
    "chandrasekhar & fermi@xmath0(1953 ) examined development of the gravitational instability in a uniformly magnetized , plane - parallel gas layer .",
    "they showed that the existence of uniform fields does nt change the critical wavelength for onset of the jeans instability but only reduces its growth rate .",
    "when non - uniform field is considered , the critical wavelength does change and the gas layer becomes more unstable than the uniformly magnetized case@xmath0(stodlkeiwicz 1963 ; nakano 1988 ) .",
    "nakamura et al.@xmath0(1991 ) showed that self - gravitating , magnetized gas disk is subject to the parker - type and the jeans instabilities simultaneously .",
    "since all of these investigations were done in the plane defined by the vertical and the magnetic field directions , they could nt address the question whether the self gravity could put a curb upon flaring motions of the convection .",
    "elmegreen@xmath0(1982 ) is the first who seriously examined possible roles of the self gravity in modifying the classical picture of the parker instability .",
    "his stability analysis was , in principle , of the three - dimensional nature .",
    "however , he integrated the basic mhd equations over the whole extent of the disk , which made the analysis two - dimensional in reality",
    ".    in a more recent study , nagai et al.@xmath0(1998 ) made a fully three - dimensional stability analysis onto a uniformly magnetized , self - gravitating gas disk .",
    "however , the parker instability could not be triggered in their systems , because the magnetic fields were not vertically stratified .",
    "instead they examined how the disk thickness might influence the alignment of filamentary structures with respect to the magnetic field direction .",
    "chou et al.@xmath0(2000 ) carried out an extensive analysis on non - uniformly magnetized , self - gravitating gas layers , for some cases including the external gravity as well .",
    "their linear analysis was further extended to nonlinear , three - dimensional mhd simulations . in their systems , however , the interchange mode did nt have a chance to drive convective motions , because only isothermal perturbations were applied to the background equilibrium which was in the same isothermal condition . and",
    "contrary to our objectives their main concern was on parsec - scale structures in the interstellar medium .",
    "we took adiabatic perturbations in one of our earlier three - dimensional stability analyses and saw a possibility of controlling the convection by the self gravity@xmath0(lee & hong 1999 ; lee et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in principle",
    "the parker instability in the galactic ism disk should be studied under simultaneous influence of the external and the self gravities . in this study",
    "we take the self gravity as the sole driving agent of the instability and examine what modifications it could bring to the classical picture of the parker instability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  @xmath02 we will construct an initial equilibrium configuration for the self - gravitating , magnetized , isothermal gas disk , and then perform linear stability analysis onto it . in ",
    "@xmath03 we will interpret the resulting dispersion relations in terms of the convective , the parker and the jeans instabilities . in  @xmath04 we will assess whether introduction of the self gravity as the driving agent might ease the major problems confronting the classical parker instability .",
    "in the same section the resulting scales of the maximum growth rate will be compared with the observations of hi superclouds and gmcs . in the last section",
    "we will conclude the paper with some discussions .",
    "appendix a details on coefficients of the linearized perturbation equations , and in appendix b stable wave modes are isolated . marginal stability analysis is carried out in appendix c.",
    "we model the local part of the galactic ism disk as a self - gravitating , magnetized , isothermal gas layer , which is initially in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium and bound by a hot halo at @xmath3 = @xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "unperturbed magnetic field @xmath7 = @xmath8 $ ] has azimuthal component only and its strength varies with vertical distance .    in such disk the vertical structure",
    "is described by the equation of magnetohydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath9 = -\\rho_{\\mathrm{o}}(z ) { { d \\psi_{\\mathrm{o}}(z)}\\over{dz}},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denote gas pressure , self - gravitational potential , and gas density , respectively .",
    "the potential is to be obtained from the poisson equation , @xmath13 and the gas pressure is related to density as @xmath14 with the isothermal sound speed , @xmath15 , taken to be equal to the @xmath16 velocity of interstellar ` coudlets . ' in this study cosmic rays are ignored ; instead , we will focus on the role of self gravity .",
    "the ratio , @xmath17 , of magnetic to gas pressure is kept constant of @xmath3 for the initial equilibrium .",

    "a third condition comes from pressure continuity .",
    "it is the sum of the gas and the magnetic pressures that should be kept continuous at the boundary . by integrating @xmath3-component of the mhd momentum equation from @xmath73 to @xmath79",
    ", one may have the total pressure at the perturbed boundary as @xmath80 therefore , the total boundary pressure , @xmath81 , calculated from the disk side becomes @xmath82 to first order of @xmath83 .",
    "for the same boundary pressure , @xmath84 , but calculated from the halo side , we may have @xmath85 where perturbation of the halo gas pressure @xmath86 has been ignored , as the halo medium is thought to be very hot",
    ". also ignored is the gravitational potential term , because the halo is filled with a rarefied medium . by equating @xmath81 to @xmath84 at the boundary",
    ", we finally have the pressure continuity condition as @xmath87    now @xmath88 has to be specified . from the induction equation [ eq . ( 10 ) ]",

    "therefore , @xmath90 can be given by magnetic potential @xmath91 simply as @xmath92 with @xmath93 equation ( 28 ) tells us that the vertical component of the magnetic field becomes @xmath94 at the disk side boundary . from the halo side , equation ( 29 ) shows @xmath95 . by equating @xmath96 to @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 and the azimuthal field component @xmath99 and its substitution for @xmath88 in equation ( 27 ) finally gives the pressure continuity condition as : @xmath100    in terms of the dimensionless variables the upper boundary conditions [ eqs .",

    "along with the upper - boundary continuity and the midplane parity conditions , equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) comprise an eigenvalue problem for @xmath109 . for given perturbation wave vector ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 )",
    "we take a trial value for @xmath109 , and integrate the equations from @xmath112 = @xmath113 to @xmath112 = 0 with the fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "if the resulting solution satisfies the chosen parity condition at @xmath3 = 0 , the trial is adopted as the eigenvalue .",
    "if not , we take another trial and perform the same integration until the solution fulfills the midplane parity condition .",
    "the resulting growth rate squared , @xmath114 , is illustrated as a function of @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( not of @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) , which will keep the slope of dispersion relation the same in limits @xmath117 0 or @xmath118 0 , regardless of the disk thickness ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1978 ) .",
    "if we notice total column density is 2@xmath119 for unbound isothermal disk and 2@xmath120 for halo - bound one , we may call @xmath121 and @xmath122 normalized wave numbers that are _ effective _ for the halo - bound disk .",
    "the three parameters ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath113 ) characterize the disk system and the normalized effective wave numbers ( @xmath125 ) do the perturbation .",
    "whenever a need arises to differentiate the undular - mode instability driven by external gravity from that by self gravity , we will use the term _ classical _ parker , for which both odd- and even - parities are applicable . in the context of self gravity , we will call the instability triggered by the same undular mode but even - parity perturbations as simply the parker or the _ pure _ parker instability , while reserving the term parker - jeans for the odd - parity undular mode . on the other hand ,",
    "the instability triggered by short wavelength perturbations of the interchange mode will be called broadly as convection .",
    "long wavelength perturbations of the same mode may of course activate the gravitational instability . in this section",
    "we will examine how the convection , the pure parker instability , and the jeans gravitational instability compete or collaborate with each other in forming or de - structuring large - scale structures .      to have a comparison standard we first calculate the dispersion relation for the pure gravitational instability by taking @xmath123 = 0 , @xmath121 = 0 and imposing the odd - parity condition . for several cases of disk thickness ,",
    "figure 1a illustrates how the normalized growth rate of the gravitational instability changes with the azimuthal effective wave number",
    ". in general , the jeans instability grows faster in thicker disk .",
    "however , once it is thicker than about 4 times the scale height , the growth rate becomes almost independent of the disk thickness .    with the same set of system parameters except for @xmath123 = 1.0 , we calculate @xmath114 again as a function of @xmath122 .",
    "the resulting dispersion relations for odd- and even - parity solutions are shown , in figure 1b , by solid and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "because even - parity can not activate the gravitational instability @xmath0(simon 1965 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 1978 ) , by simply changing the parity condition from even to odd , we may easily differentiate role of the parker instability from that of the jeans in the dispersion relation .",
    "the dotted lines in figure 1b are , therefore , for the parker instability only ; while the solid ones are for the case where both the parker and the jeans instabilities operate simultaneously .",
    "this led us to coin the term _ parker - jeans _ especially for the odd - parity undular mode .",
    "a comparison of the solid lines in figures 1a and 1b indicates that the presence of magnetic fields in moderately thick disks boosts the growth rate of the gravitational instability significantly .",
    "the parker and the jeans instabilities interact constructively in the disks thicker than , say , one half the scale height ; while in the disks thinner than that , the same magnetic fields now add rigidity or extra pressure to the gas , thereby hindering growth of the gravitational instability . with marginal stability analysis",
    "( see appendix c ) we have determined the critical thickness , over which the two instabilities interact constructively or destructively : it is 0.549@xmath126 for a moderately magnetized ( @xmath127 1 ) , isothermal ( @xmath124 = 1 ) disk . as can be seen from the dotted lines in figure 1b , growth rate of the parker instability",
    "depends on thickness more sensitively than that of the jeans instability .",
    "the dotted line almost coinciding with the horizontal axis is for @xmath113 = 1 , and the dispersion relation of even - parity becomes hardly noticeable for @xmath128 1.0 .",
    "comparison of the dotted ( even - parity ) and solid ( odd - parity ) lines in figure 1b suggests that a marked increase can be achieved in the growth rate of the parker instability by triggering the gravitational instability .",
    "this opens up a possibility of alleviating the time scale problem of the classical parker instability .    to understand how the magnetic field strength modifies the dispersion relation for the undular mode",
    ", we fix the disk thickness at 5@xmath126 and vary @xmath123 over 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "the resulting @xmath114 is plotted , in figure 2 , against the effective azimuthal wave number . as before the solid and dotted lines are for odd- and even - parity solutions , respectively .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the maximum growth rate of the parker instability increases with field strength ( notice difference in the ordinates between figures 1 and 2 . ) . under an influence of vertical acceleration ,",
    "the undulated field lines give the magnetic buoyancy a chance to unload the gas material off their shoulders towards the midplane valleys . as the field strength increases , so does the buoyancy , and hence the system becomes highly unstable to the perturbations of undular mode .",
    "the resulting escalation of the parker instability then boosts development of the gravitational instability .",
    "the maximum growth rate of the odd - parity solutions , therefore , increases significantly with @xmath123 . the critical wave number for marginal stability",
    "is known to increase with @xmath123 as @xmath129 ( stodlkiewicz 1963 ) , which also indicates the constructive nature of parker and jeans interaction .",
    "we now turn our attention to the remaining system parameter , @xmath124 , which was introduced as a measure of material rigidity . to trigger the classical parker instability under external gravity ,",
    "_ effective _ ratio of the specific heats for the perturbed material should be less than a certain critical value , @xmath130 .",
    "many authors have shown @xmath131 under external gravity@xmath0(newcomb 1961 ; parker 1966 ; gilman 1970 ; kim & hong 1998 ) . in a recent study lee@xmath0(2002 ) proved that the critical value takes the same 1 + @xmath123 under the influence of self gravity as well . to somewhat dramatize the effect of @xmath124 on the growth rate we decided to fix @xmath123 at a rather small value 0.1 and examined the dispersion relation with @xmath124 varying 0.68 through 1.1 .",
    "the solid and dotted lines in figure 3 are for the odd- and even - parity solutions , respectively . for soft materials",
    "the dispersion curve exhibits two maxima : the gravitational instability is responsible for the peak occurring at smaller wave number and the parker is for the other at larger one .",
    "as @xmath124 increases , height of the parker peak decreases .",
    "this is because , as the material becomes harder , the magnetized gas system becomes more stable to the undular mode perturbation .",
    "if @xmath124 exceeds its critical value , the parker instability can not be triggered at all .",
    "owing to a heightening activity of the parker instability in softer media , the jeans peak becomes taller as @xmath124 decreases .    for most cases shown in figure 3 ,",
    "the dotted lines of even - parity match smoothly with the solid lines of odd - parity . for somewhat large @xmath124 s , however , the even - parity perturbations of undular mode grow a little faster than the odd - parity ones . under self gravity",
    "the growth rate difference between the even- and odd - parity solutions is too small to render any significant consequences to the spatial distribution of the resulting condensations with respect to the midplane . in the case of classical parker instability , however , the even - parity perturbations grow substantially faster than the odd - parity ones .",
    "therefore , the condensations , if they were generated by the classical parker instability , would place their maximum density points on the northern and southern sides of the midplane alternatively@xmath0(kim et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "figure 3 suggests that the undular mode of odd - parity triggers both the jeans and the parker instabilities in the @xmath124 = 0.68 disk , for example .",
    "the two most rapidly growing perturbations in the disk have @xmath132 8.6@xmath126 for the jeans instability and @xmath132 3.5@xmath126 for the parker case . on the other hand ,",
    "the perturbations of the same undular mode with the same @xmath132 8.6@xmath126 but of even - parity would turn off the gravitational instability and drive the system to develop only the parker .",
    "we have shown , in figures 4a , 4b and 4c , eigen - solutions for the cases with @xmath132 8.6@xmath126 of odd - parity , with @xmath132 3.5@xmath126 of odd - parity , and with @xmath132 8.6@xmath126 of even - parity , respectively . in the left panel ,",
    "the color changes from dark red to white as density increases , and the numbers marked on each contours represent logarithm of the density perturbation , @xmath133 , measured in units of the initial equilibrium density , @xmath134 , at the midplane . in the right hand panels , contours in thin solid lines are for the magnetic fields and the ones in thick lines delineate the halo boundary .",
    "small arrows inside the panels represent velocity vectors , a big arrow on top of frame _ a _ and _ b _ corresponds to two times the sound speed , and that of frame _ c _ does just one .    an action of the self gravity is apparent from the velocity pattern in figure 4a . in the region of inflated field lines",
    "the magnetic buoyancy drives matter to rise against the self gravity ; while in the magnetic valley the self gravity does the driving in an opposite direction and collects material towards the center .",
    "we see motions taking place everywhere in the @xmath135-plane . even in the midplane",
    "one may witness a converging motion , which is made possible by the self gravity and can not be expected under the external gravity . as a final product of the jeans instability the system will bear out a dense clump centered at y @xmath136 4.3 .",
    "velocity vectors in figure 4b exhibit a pattern markedly different from the ones in figure 4a .",
    "magnitude of the velocity vectors quickly diminishes towards central plane , and they hardly exhibit any motions in the midplane .",
    "the magnetic field lines in low altitudes maintain their initial configuration almost intact .",
    "features of the perturbed density , the magnetic fields and the velocity patterns in figure 4b are all very similar to the corresponding cases of the classical parker instability that is driven by an external gravity of linear model@xmath0(lee 1993 ) . as a final product of the parker instability",
    "the system will bear out clumps centered at y @xmath136 1.7 , 5.2 and 8.5 .",
    "the iso - density contours for odd - parity solutions in figures 4a and 4b demonstrate dense clumps formed right in the midplane .",
    "the deformation of boundary is closely related to the enhanced density near the midplane@xmath0(elmegreen & elmegreen 1978 ) .",
    "a rise and a fall of the boundary surface from its initial equilibrium height @xmath137 = 5@xmath126 accompany a fall and a rise in the midplane density , respectively .",
    "eigen - solutions of the even - parity shown in figure 4c make a marked contrast to the odd - parity solutions in figures 4a and 4b .",
    "the upper and lower boundaries make the rise - and - fall motions in unison .",
    "active motions are apparent only in high above the midplane .",
    "these features are very much reminiscent of the parker instability driven by a linear model of external gravity@xmath0(lee 1993 ) .",
    "it is quite clear that the classical parker instability may not be the formation mechanism of such large - scale structures as gmcs or hi superclouds .",
    "the gmcs are attributes of the galactic midplane , while the parker instability generates actions at high altitudes .",
    "to have such dense structures as gmcs in the disk central plane , we need to invoke the self gravity not only to drive the parker undular mode but also to trigger the jeans gravitational instability .",
    "as far as forming large - scale structures is concerned , the _ odd - parity _ undular mode deserves our special attention , because it will drive the system to develop the jeans gravitational instability and the parker instability simultaneously .",
    "if the two instabilities work constructively , they would generate dense condensations in the central plane . on the other hand , the undular mode perturbations of _ even - parity _",
    "drive the system to develop only the parker instability , whose activities are confined mostly to high altitude regions , where gmcs ar not generally found .",
    "the question then is whether the resulting condensations of the odd - parity solutions are safe from disruption by convective motions .      to construct dispersion relation for the _ pure _ interchange mode",
    ", we fix azimuthal wave number at zero ( @xmath122 = 0 ) and calculate the growth rate as a function of effective radial wave number @xmath121 .",
    "the results for the odd - parity solutions are shown , in figure 5 , for the disks of a moderately magnetized ( @xmath123 = 1 ) , self - gravitating , isothermal gas medium .",
    "as was seen from figure 1a for the non - magnetized gas disk , the maximum growth rate generally increases with disk thickness .",
    "however , for the disks thicker than @xmath15@xmath126 , the dispersion relations for different thickness are hardly distinguishable from each other .",
    "once the upper boundary is placed beyond a certain distance from the midplane , development of the gravitational instability in the densest part of the system does nt depend much on where the boundary is located . in disks thinner than @xmath1@xmath126/3 , the growth rate again becomes independent of the thickness .",
    "in such thin halo - bound disks , there is practically no gradient in density over vertical distance , and the gas acts like an incompressible fluid ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 1978 ; lubow & pringle 1993 ; nagai et al .",
    "1998 ; lee 2002 ) .",
    "a sizeable difference exists in the maximum growth rate between non - magnetized ( see figure 1a ) and magnetized ( see figure 5 ) disks .",
    "perturbations of the interchange mode make density and magnetic flux change in phase , and thus activate fast magneto - acoustic waves to propagate in the radial direction .",
    "since the fast waves tend to disperse enhanced density , the gravitational instability triggered by the interchange mode ought to grow slower than that by the undular mode .",
    "this is the reason for the difference between the two modes .",
    "we saw from figure 2 that the existence of magnetic fields boosts the gravitational instability triggered by the undular mode . to check whether the same boosting is possible for the interchange mode",
    ", we calculate @xmath114 of the odd - parity solutions for @xmath123 = 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "as shown in figure 6 , the maximum growth rate decreases with @xmath123 .",
    "this trend is opposite to the case of the undular mode . with the interchange perturbations the magnetic fields have no means for adding extra material to the densest region of the disk ; instead they act to disperse the enhanced density by driving the fast magneto - acoustic waves .",
    "therefore , the growth rate of the interchange mode decreases with increasing field strength .",
    "in all the cases illustrated in figures 5 and 6 , the magnetic field is too strong to satisfy the criterion , @xmath138 , for convection .",
    "originally this criterion is known to hold for disks under external gravity ( newcomb 1961 ; parker 1967 ; zweibel & kulsrud 1975 ; asso et al .",
    "1978 ; lachize - rey et al .",
    "1978 ) . as for the @xmath130 criterion for",
    "the classical parker instability , lee ( 2002 ) showed that the same convection criterion , @xmath139 , is applicable to the self gravity case .    adopting a weakly magnetized ( @xmath123 = 0.1 ) disk to see the convective motions and assigning small values to the ratio of effective specific heats to meet the convection criterion , we calculated the dispersion relation as a function of @xmath121 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 7 , where the solid and the dotted lines are for the odd- and the even - parities , respectively , and on each curve @xmath124 is marked .",
    "the well - defined peak corresponds to the jeans instability ; while the monotonically increasing part is owing to the convective instability .",
    "the even - parity perturbations can not trigger the gravitational instability but certainly can activate the convection . after passing a minimum",
    "the growth rate first increases monotonically with radial wave number and reaches a finite value asymptotically as the wave number further increases : arrows outside the frame indicate the limiting values of the growth rate . under external gravities",
    "the interchange mode perturbations of the shortest wavelengths are to grow most rapidly and deprive the undular mode of the chance to form large - scale structures . under the self gravity , however , the maximum growth rate of the gravitational instability can be higher than the limiting growth rate of the convective instability .",
    "the self gravity may thus have a chance fully to suppress convective motions .",
    "this is a most important attribute of the self - gravitating disk .",
    "since the external gravity exerts acceleration of fixed strength only in the vertical direction , there is no means of de - structuring the vertical sheets generated by the convective motions .",
    "once a substantial degree of density enhancement is achieved , however , the ever increasing self gravity can provide the system with a means for redirecting the vertical motions towards the dense mass center .",
    "even if the convection can grow faster than the jeans instability in linear stage of the disk evolution , particularly in ` soft ' medium of small @xmath124 s , the convective motion wo nt prevent the system from forming dense structures in the midplane for two reasons : first , no buoyancy force is available in the midplane and hence no convective motions can take place there .",
    "second , the acceleration due to self gravity increases with density enhancement .",
    "therefore , once the gravitational instability is triggered by odd - parity perturbations , it will eventually dominate the disk over the convection .",
    "the eigen - solution of the odd - parity interchange mode was constructed for the case with @xmath124 = 0.68 and @xmath140 = 0.6 ( @xmath141 = 10.5@xmath126 ) , which corresponds the well - defined growth rate peak in figure 7 .",
    "the same was done of the even - parity interchange mode with @xmath140 = 3.0 ( @xmath141 = 2.1@xmath126 ) , which is a convection dominating case . figures 8a and 8b compare the two sets of eigen - solutions in the @xmath142-plane .",
    "the left and right panels illustrate density and velocity fields , respectively , and the color changes from dark red to white as density increases .",
    "the numbers marked to thin solid lines on the left are logarithms of @xmath143 .",
    "the thick solid lines on the right demarcate the disk - halo boundary , the arrows inside the frames represent velocity vectors , and the horizontal arrow on top of each frame is a measure of the sound speed .",
    "a well - defined density clump in figure 8a is obviously a result of the converging motions driven by the jeans instability .",
    "the velocity pattern in figure 8a closely resembles the same pattern in figure 4a : converging motions are evident all over the @xmath142-plane in figure 8a and the @xmath135-plane in figure 4a .",
    "figure 8a suggests that once the interchange mode perturbation generates a slight density enhancement at a midplane point , towards which the self gravity would collect material and form a density clump . on the other hand",
    ", we do nt expect from figure 8b such clump to form in the midplane : motions are absent from the low altitude region .",
    "we now calculate the growth rate as a function of @xmath140 and @xmath144 .",
    "the results are presented in a three dimensional surface plot of @xmath114 over the wave number domain .",
    "as our interest is primarily in forming large - scale structures in the galactic ism disk , we fix the disk thickness at @xmath145 = 5 , which is sufficiently larger than the critical value , 0.549 ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "figures 9a and 9b are for _ even_-parity solutions with ( @xmath123 = 1 , @xmath124 = 1 ) and ( @xmath123 = 0.1 , @xmath124 = 0.8 ) , respectively .",
    "the surface plot in figure 9a looks like a long ` tunnel ' , and we already met , in figure 1b , the dispersion curve outlining the tunnel ` entrance ' at @xmath140 = 0 .",
    "cross - section of the tunnel cut perpendicularly to the @xmath140-axis describes the dispersion relation of the parker instability triggered by _",
    "undular _ portion of the mixed mode perturbation .",
    "please note that the tunnel ridge inclines slowly with @xmath140 .",
    "this is owing to the interchange part of the mixed mode .",
    "pure _ interchange mode ( i.e. , @xmath144 = 0 ) does nt trigger the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability ( cf . , chandrasekhar [ 1961 ] for this terminology ) , since this disk does not satisfy the @xmath139 criterion for this particular mode .",
    "but _ interchange _ part of the mixed perturbation does trigger the convection everywhere in the ( @xmath140 , @xmath144 ) plane except at @xmath144 = 0 , since another condition @xmath146 is required for truly mixed mode .",
    "it is the convection that makes the ` ridge ' incline with increasing @xmath140 . in the case shown in figure 9b ,",
    "the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability is activated by the _",
    "pure _ interchange mode , as the disk satisfies now the condition @xmath139 .",
    "this is why the tunnel wall of figure 9b is partially ` open ' on the @xmath144 = 0 side .",
    "the three - dimensional plots shown in figures 9c and 9d are for the _ odd_-parity solutions but with the same set of system parameters as in figures 9a and 9b , respectively .",
    "we may relate the two peaks located on the @xmath140- and @xmath144- axes to the jeans and the parker - jeans instabilities , respectively .",
    "the peak with @xmath140 = 0 is significantly higher than the one with @xmath144 = 0 , since the undular mode perturbation provides the parker instability with favorable field configurations to assist the jeans .",
    "on the other hand , the pure interchange mode may not get any boosting from the parker instability .",
    "consequently , the pure jeans peak on the @xmath140-axis is always lower than the parker - jeans on the @xmath144-axis .",
    "the long ridge along @xmath144 @xmath136 1 is of course owing to the convection - assisted parker instability ; as for the case of even - parity solutions , the convection makes the ridge height incline with @xmath140 .",
    "but the ridge reaches a finite level in the limit @xmath121@xmath147@xmath148 .",
    "when mixed mode perturbations of the odd - parity are given to the self - gravitating , magnetized , gaseous disk , the jeans , parker and convective instabilities may all develop in the disk , and their relative importance depends on the ( @xmath149 ) combination .",
    "we have constructed , from figure 9c , a plot of equal growth - rate contours in the ( @xmath125 ) plane and presented the resulting contour map in figure 10 .",
    "the thick dashed - line is for a special contour , whose growth rate is equal to the the highest ridge level : any perturbations with wave numbers falling within the dashed - line boundary would grow faster than the ones outside .",
    "therefore , with such perturbations , a collaboration of the parker and the jeans instabilities may well suppress the convection and the disk will bear out large - scale structures .    in a recent two - dimensional mhd simulation ,",
    "kim & ostriker @xmath0(2002 ) followed nonlinear responses of a self - gravitating , magnetized , differentially rotating , thin disk to an externally imposed spiral potential , and demonstrated regularly spaced spurs jotting out initially in an almost perpendicular direction to the arm . although nonlinear interaction of the parker - jeans instability and the spiral shock wave is out of the scope of this paper , it should be pointed out that the highest point of the growth rate surface is located on the @xmath144-axis@xmath0(see figure 10 ) .",
    "this is always so , if the disk is thicker than @xmath10.549@xmath150(see appendix c ) .",
    "the resulting structure is , therefore , of a cylindrical shape with its long axis being aligned perpendicularly to the direction of magnetic field lines or spiral arm@xmath0(nagai et al .",
    "1998 ; lee & hong 1999 ; chou et al .",
    "it is then suggestive that the cylindrical structures of this study will make the spurs in the context of differential rotation and density wave .",
    "the odd - parity undular mode seems to have tailored the regular spacing and initial alignment of the spurs .",
    "a replacement of driving agent of the parker instability from the external to the self gravity opens up a new route , through which the instability may work constructively with the jeans gravitational instability to form large - scale structures in the galactic ism disk . in a qualitative sense ,",
    "the undular mode odd - parity solutions seem to have all the means of alleviating the difficulties involved in the time scale , length scale and density enhancement of the classical parker instability . in this section",

    "through the present study we come to realize that in previous investigations role of the interchange mode was unduly stressed in its tendency of disrupting large - scale ism structures that the undular mode might otherwise have formed .",
    "the unfair emphasis was the price to pay for both adoption of the external gravity as and neglect of the self gravity from driving agent of the parker instability . in this paper",
    "we have examined what modifications could be made to the classical picture of the parker instability by assigning the driving task solely to the self gravity .    if the vertical acceleration rendered by the adopted driving agent is a constant of perpendicular distance from the central plane , it may act as a source of buoyancy force over the entire disk . consequently , under such unrealistic uniform external gravity , convective motions are to be activated everywhere in the disk , and the interchange mode will indeed dominate the magnetized gas disk over the undular one . in reality , however , the vertical acceleration due mostly to the galactic stars increases linearly , from zero at the midplane , with the perpendicular distance up to about a half kpc , beyond which it remains more or less constant .",
    "this type of external gravity can not be a buoyancy source in the disk midplane at least , where gmcs are mostly found ; while the convection is pronouncedly active , under the realistic non - uniform gravity , only in high altitude regions , where the vertical acceleration reaches its maximum .",
    "the convection would nt then be an obstacle for the classical parker instability to form , for example , gmcs in the midplane , if the undular mode could collect enough material there before the interchange mode develops chaotic sheets at high altitudes .",
    "however , as long as the buoyancy force is available , the growth rate of the convection increases within the limiting value as the perturbation wavelength gets smaller and smaller .",
    "therefore , even if all the realistic features are taken into account for the external gravity , the convection triggered by the interchange mode would develop small - scale features well before the classical parker instability excited by the undular mode generates any dense large - scale structures in the disk central plane .",
    "magnetic valleys eventually anchor some material towards the central plane , but the material takes form of vertically oriented thin sheets rather than of dense clumps , because the external gravity has only vertical component of acceleration . as long as the driving task is assigned to the external gravity , there is no means to divert the convective motions from the vertical direction and to form clumps instead of sheets .",
    "the thick dashed - line in figure 10 represents the growth rate contour corresponding to the highest ridge level .",
    "any perturbations whose wave numbers are within the dashed - line boundary would grow faster than the ones outside . therefore , with such perturbations , a collaboration of the parker and jeans instabilities may well suppress the convection and the disk will bear out large - scale structures .",
    "once the self gravity takes over the driving task from the external gravity , the effect of the jeans gravitational instability due to the self gravity appears on the dispersion curves .",
    "the maximum growth rate of the jeans instability at the large - wavelength perturbations can be be higher than the limiting growth rate of the convection at the small - wavelength perturbations , depending on the adiabatic index ( cf .",
    ", figure 7 ) .",
    "this is not what we ve seen from the external gravity case .",
    "therefore , for long - wavelength perturbations of odd - parity , the maximum growth rate of the undular mode becomes even _",
    "faster _ than the highest growth rate value of the interchange mode ( cf . ,",
    "figure 10 ) .",
    "the odd - parity undular mode thus opens up a route in the magnetized disk , through which the parker and jeans instabilities work jointly to form large - scale condensations in the midplane before the interchange mode disperses them into thin sheets .    in this way",
    "the parker - jeans instability is expected to remove major difficulties in forming the large - scale ism structures . to check whether this expectation can be fulfilled by the odd - parity undular mode ,",
    "we have compared the resulting time , length and mass scales with the corresponding observations of the hi superclouds and gmcs .",
    "as far as the time scale is concerned , the parker - jeans instability grows quickly enough to satisfy the observational criteria for the hi superclouds and the gmcs as well ( cf .",
    ", figure 11 ) .",
    "the formation time scales inferred from various observations do nt impose any tight limits on the system parameters , particularly on @xmath123 , and the comparison done in figure 11 does nt seem to differentiate the hi superclouds from the gmcs either .",
    "it was a bit surprise to us .",
    "because of the neglect of cosmic rays , we thought , the time scale of the parker - jeans would meet the observational criteria only barely . in a recent study ryu et al.@xmath0(2003 ) treated cosmic rays with the diffusion - convection equation and realistic diffusion coefficients for both directions , perpendicular and parallel to the field lines .",
    "they have demonstrated that by pumping an extra buoyancy into the disk system , cosmic rays make an about factor two increase in the growth rate of the classical pure parker mode , _",
    "i.e. _ , of the instability triggered by the undular perturbation under the uniform external gravity .",
    "the factor two may not be fully applied to the parker - jeans case , because the uniform external gravity exaggerates buoyancy .",
    "nevertheless , if cosmic rays had been included , a substantial further reduction would have been made in the growth time scale .",
    "it may worth reminding that the jeans gravitational instability was called in to support the parker in the first place .",
    "and the result was successful , as was demonstrated by the @xmath221 - ratios in table 1 : a small increase in @xmath222 will result in a sizeable amplification through the ratio .",
    "an inclusion of rotation would nt change the situation in any significant way , because the rotation is known to decrease the growth rate by a few to fifteen percents only@xmath0(shu 1974 ) .",
    "along this line of reasonings , if 2@xmath0@xmath154 is not an unrealistic choice for @xmath186 in the galaxy , we believe that the time scale we now have is an under - estimate for the galactic ism disk .",
    "the reason for the underestimation seems to be in our neglect of the external gravity .    as to the length scale , the parker - jeans instability seems to operate more efficiently than what is required for the hi superclouds . under ` canonical ' conditions of the galactic ism with @xmath123 = 0.5",
    ", the odd - parity undular mode shows its maximum growth rate at wavelength 1.5@xmath0kpc , which is less than the observed mean separation , 2.4@xmath0kpc , of the hi superclouds@xmath0(mcgee & milton 1964 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 1983 ; alfaro et al .",
    "1992 ; efremov 1995 ) .",
    "because of the conceptual difficulty in applying a single velocity dispersion to the entire ism disk , one may not consider this much difference in the length scale to be serious .",
    "however , we think the difference is a significant one , because existence of cosmic rays would reduce the wavelength further .",
    "therefore , comparison of the length scale also suggests an over - subscription of the self gravity in our disk system .    from dispersion relations shown in figures 1 and 2",
    "we notice the growth rate peak for the even - parity undular mode does nt survive in the competition with the odd - parity : the growth rate peak of the pure parker mode is overwhelmed by the parker - jeans peak .",
    "this holds true for wide ranges of disk thickness and magnetic - to - gas pressure ratio . as was illustrated in figure 3",
    ", the parker peak may survive the parker - jeans overwhelming only in such unrealistically soft media as the ones having @xmath2230.7 , for example . in the magnetized gas disks where only the self gravity is operative to excite instabilities with the undular mode",
    ", it does nt seem to be possible to have two distinct growth - rate peaks in the dispersion curve , and the present study indicates that the overwhelming parker - jeans maximum is strongly tied to the structures of the hi supercloud scale , not to the gmc scale ones . as elmegreen(1994 ) pointed out , the characteristic mass and mean separation of the hi superclouds are natural outcomes of the gravitational instability in the self gravity dominating disk systems .    to relate both the gmc and hi supercloud structures to the single parker - jeans peak ,",
    "one may rely on two - stage formation scenarios : the hi supercloud forms first and some time later the gmcs emerge as fragment products of the supercloud .",
    "this idea was suggested in the previous section reluctantly , because of the gmcs that are residing outside the supercloud .",
    "almost all of the hi superclouds contain gmcs , but not all the gmcs belong to the hi superclouds ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1987 ; efremov & sitnik 1988 ) .",
    "instead refining the two - stage idea , we should first pay attention to the external gravity heretofore ignored .",
    "in fact the external gravity renders vertical acceleration about 5 times stronger than the one expected from the equilibrium ism stratification in our galaxy ( bienaym et al .",
    "1987 ; ferrire 1998a ; boulares & cox 1990 ; lee et al .",
    "of course in later stages the ever increasing self gravity of ism eventually override the fixed external gravity , but in the initial stage the self gravity is definitely over - subscribed in our model disk .",
    "a balanced subscription between the external and self gravities for the task of instability driving would reduce dominance of the parker - jeans peak on one hand and enhance the parker maximum on the other . in this way the odd - parity undular mode may exhibit two distinctly separated growth - rate peaks in the dispersion curve , with the one at smaller wave number corresponding to hi superclouds and the other at larger number to gmcs .    from these discussions",
    "we may conclude the paper as follows : the present study has reconfirmed that the parker instability triggered by the undular mode under external gravity may not be a route towards the formation of such large - scale structures as the gmcs in the galaxy ( kim et al .",
    "2004 ) . even under the self gravity",
    ", the even - parity undular mode solution can not accommodate important observational properties of the large - scale structures ; however , the odd - parity undular mode is shown to have all the potentials to remove major difficulties that have been confronting the classical parker instability as the formation mechanism of the large - scale structures .",
    "the resulting time , length , and mass scales of the parker - jeans instability are shown to be in better agreement with the hi superclouds than with the gmcs .",
    "an inclusion of the external gravity along with a proper treatment of the cosmic rays would refine the agreement towards the desired direction .",

    "<S> to be a formation mechanism of such large - scale structures as giant molecular clouds @xmath0(gmcs ) and hi superclouds , the classical parker instability driven by external gravity has to overcome three major obstacles : the convective motion accompanying the instability generates thin sheets than large condensations . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of density enhancement achieved by the instability is too low to make dense interstellar clouds . the time and the length scales of the instability are significantly longer and larger than the estimated formation time and the observed mean separation of the gmcs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this paper examines whether a replacement of the driving agent from the external to the self gravity might remove these obstacles by activating the gravitational instability in the galactic ism disk . </S>",
    "<S> self - gravitating , magnetized , gas disk bound by a hot halo medium is subject to a parker - type instability driven by the self gravity , the usual jeans instability and the convection . if the disk is thicker than a certain critical value , the parker - type instability due to perturbations of undular mode assists the jeans gravitational instability to form large - scale structures . under the external gravity , </S>",
    "<S> the convection triggered by interchange mode perturbations is to grow most rapidly ; under the self gravity , however , the jeans gravitational instability can have a growth rate higher than the limiting growth rate of the convective instability </S>",
    "<S> . the self gravity can thus suppress the convective motions , and a cooperative action of the jeans and the parker instabilities can remove all the obstacles confronting the classical version of the parker instability . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and mean separation of the structures resulting from the odd - parity undular mode solution are shown to agree better with the hi superclouds than with the gmcs . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss how inclusions of the external gravity and cosmic rays would modify behaviors of the odd - parity undular mode solution . </S>"
