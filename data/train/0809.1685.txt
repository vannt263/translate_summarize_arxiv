    "the infrastructure of a global field , i.e.  of a number field or a function field over a finite field , is a group - like algebraic structure .",
    "it is a crucial ingredient in the computation of the regulator , a system of fundamental units , and the order and structure of the ideal class group . in the case of a one - dimensional infrastructure , which occurs in in fields of unit rank  one , this group - like structure",
    "was first used by d.  shanks to compute the regulator of a real quadratic number field via a baby - step giant - step algorithm .    in this paper",
    ", we present a framework of infrastructure that unifies number fields and function fields . the crucial tool to accomplish this are @xmath0-representations ; these represent a group well suited for computations into which the infrastructure embeds . using @xmath0-representations",
    ", we obtain giant steps , which are an important tool in algorithms of baby - step giant - step type . we establish that @xmath0-representations require little storage and lend themselves very well to computation .",
    "they can be efficiently used for determining a system of fundamental units of a global function field .",
    "we provide evidence for this by presenting preliminary implementation results as well as non - trivial numerical examples .",
    "the idea behind @xmath0-representations was described in @xcite in the one - dimensional case , i.e.  for infrastructures obtained from global fields of unit rank  one .",
    "the concept of @xmath0-representations goes back to @xmath1-representations , which were introduced in the context of cryptography in real quadratic number fields by d.  hhnlein and s.  paulus @xcite and m.  j.  jacobson  jr .",
    ", r.  scheidler and h.  c.  williams @xcite .",
    "infrastructures of number fields and , more recently , of function fields have been studied for some time .",
    "their investigation has its roots in c.  f.  gau study of the composition of binary quadratic forms , as well as j .- l .",
    "lagrange s continued fraction algorithm .",
    "the infrastructure first appeared explicitly in the context of generalizing continued fraction expansion . in his phd dissertation ,",
    "g.  vorono  found a generalization of continued fraction expansion by minima of lattices and formulated an algorithm to find a system of fundamental units of a cubic number field @xcite .",
    "the set of minima of a global field was studied , for example in @xcite , and was used for computing fundamental units in number fields , for example in @xcite .",
    "j.  a.  buchmann generalized vorono s algorithm to number fields of unit rank one and two @xcite .",
    "subsequently , he presented a generalization of lagrange s algorithm for computing fundamental units in arbitrary number fields in @xmath2 binary operations ; here @xmath3 arbitrary , @xmath4 is the regulator and @xmath5 the discriminant of the number field @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath6 for any  @xmath3 .    in 1972",
    ", d.  shanks @xcite discovered that the principal infrastructure of a real quadratic number field supports a group - like structure . with every element of the principal infrastructure",
    "is associated a distance which imposes an ordering on this set .",
    "the infrastructure supports two operations : a _ baby step _",
    ", which proceeds cyclically from one element to the next in this ordering , and a _ giant step _ , which is akin to multiplication in a cyclic group and under which distances behave almost additively .",
    "as a result , the principal infrastructure is almost an abelian group under giant steps that only slightly fails associativity . using this group - like behavior",
    ", shanks was able to compute the regulator and therefore the absolute value of a fundamental unit of a real quadratic number field in @xmath7 steps instead of the @xmath8 steps required by the classical algorithm of lagrange .",
    "note that writing down a system of fundamental units requires @xmath8 binary operations , whence no algorithm can compute a system of fundamental units in time faster than @xmath8 .",
    "however , the logarithm of an absolute value of a fundamental unit can be computed faster .",
    "shanks method was further analyzed and refined by h.  w.  lenstra , r.  schoof , h.  c.  williams and m.  c.  wunderlich in @xcite , and finally generalized to all number fields of unit rank  one by buchmann and williams @xcite .",
    "shanks method was first extended to function fields in works of a.  stein and h.  g.  zimmer @xcite , stein and williams @xcite and scheidler and stein @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the infrastructure in real elliptic and hyperelliptic function fields and the divisor class group in their imaginary counterparts was investigated by stein in @xcite , and by s.  paulus and h .-",
    "rck in @xcite .",
    "shanks discovery of the infrastructure also led to a number of cryptographic applications .",
    "the first of these was a diffie - hellman - like key exchange protocol described by buchmann and williams , and later by scheidler , buchmann and williams in @xcite .",
    "this was extended in several ways , and additional encryption and signature schemes were proposed ; some of these are described in @xcite .",
    "the security of these systems is argued to be based on the hardness of computing distances or computing the regulator ; the hardness of these problems is analyzed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "all efficient algorithms and cryptosystems based on the infrastructure crucially require the giant step operation .",
    "this raises the question of whether a giant step can be defined and used efficiently in all global fields , not just of unit rank one . in the number field case ,",
    "buchmann showed in his habilitation thesis @xcite that there is in fact such a giant step , and that this giant step can be used to compute the absolute values of fundamental units in @xmath9 binary operations .",
    "unfortunately , this algorithm was only published in buchmann s thesis , which was written in german and is not easily accessible .",
    "later , schoof presented a modern treatment of the general number field case using arakelov divisor theory @xcite .",
    "this is so far the most general treatment of infrastructure .",
    "it includes the concept of a giant step , even though schoof does not give a baby - step giant - step algorithm like buchmann s .",
    "both buchmann s and schoof s giant steps rely on a simple reduction strategy : the infrastructure is in both cases a subset of the set of fractional ideals , whose elements are called `` reduced ideals '' , and the giant step roughly corresponds to multiplying two such ideals .",
    "the result is in general not inside this set , but after finding a `` short '' element in the product and dividing by it , the resulting ideal will lie in this set .",
    "this process of chosing the short element is called _",
    "reduction_.    in this paper , we present for the first time a unified treatment of number fields and function fields and define infrastructure for any unit rank . moreover , we provide a connection between the infrastructure and the ( arakelov ) divisor class group and relate the arithmetic in these two objects .",
    "the key point is a more sophisticated reduction strategy , mimicking the reduction described by f.  he  for arithmetic in the divisor class groups of global function fields @xcite .",
    "for that , we have to use a slightly different embedding of the reduced ideals into the arakelov divisor class group than the one used by schoof .",
    "we also do not use the oriented arakelov divisor class group , but instead an equivalence relation on reduced ideals in case when there is no real embedding of the number field .",
    "this allows us to unify arithmetic in the ( arakelov ) divisor class group of both number fields and function fields .",
    "moreover , in contrast to schoof s work , we `` parameterize '' the arakelov divisor class group using equivalence classes of reduced divisors together with a finite set of real numbers , and can describe explicit arithmetic using this representation .",
    "this parameterization generalizes the aforementioned result by paulus and rck @xcite on hyperelliptic function fields , and , since it extends he approach , it also generalizes known arithmetic in imaginary hyperelliptic and superelliptic function fields @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by giving an overview of the arithmetic in number fields and function fields in section  [ fnf - intro ]",
    ". then we will provide an abstract treatment of one - dimensional infrastructures , based on @xcite , in section  [ odi - intro ] .",
    "we discuss how an abstract @xmath10-dimensional infrastructure can be defined in section  [ ndiminfra ] .",

    "one can interpret them as buchmann in @xcite as a tool which computes all reduced elements whose distance lies in a given parallelepiped , as this allows baby - step giant - step algorithms for arbitrary infrastructures .",
    "unfortunately , no efficient method for computing these `` baby steps '' is known for number fields .",
    "another open question is whether one can find an efficient unique representation of elements in @xmath53 in case no infinite place of degree  one is available .",
    "having a unique representation of an element in @xmath707 is required to do fast look - ups as in algorithms of baby - step giant - step type .",
