    "fermionic superfluidity might be realized in the interior of neutron stars where the temperature is low and the typical energy scale of particles is extremely high . in particular , in the inner crust of standard neutron stars the attractive interaction between neutrons can lead to the formation of a bcs condensate .    a way to detect or to discard the presence of a superfluid phase in compact stars consists in studying the evolution of the r - mode oscillations  @xcite .",
    "r - modes are non - radial oscillations of a fluid with the coriolis force acting as the restoring force .",
    "they provide a severe limitation on the rotation frequency of a star through coupling to gravitational radiation .",
    "when dissipative phenomena damp these oscillations the star can rotate without losing angular momentum to gravitational radiation .",
    "if dissipative phenomena are not strong enough , the r - mode oscillations will grow exponentially fast in time and the star will keep slowing down until some dissipation mechanism is able to damp the r - mode oscillations . in this way one can put some constrains on the stellar structure ruling out phases that do not have large enough viscosity . for such studies",
    "it is necessary to consider in detail all the dissipative processes and the interactions among the various layers of a star .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have studied a novel dissipative process associated with the change in the number of protons , neutrons and electrons . in",
    "real neutron stars these processes can take place in the outer core and in the inner crust of the star and are related to beta decays and interactions between the neutron fluid and the crust .",
    "both these processes lead to the appearance of a dissipative force ( the so - called rocket term ) in the euler equations of the system .",
    "this force is due to the fact that when two or more fluids move with different velocities a change of one component into the other results in a momentum transfer between the fluids .",
    "this change in momentum is not reversible , because it is always the faster moving fluid that will lose momentum .",
    "the resulting dissipative force is proportional to the mass rate change , and to the relative velocity between the fluids .",
    "the name  rocket effect \" reminds that the same phenomenon takes place in the dynamical evolution of a rocket whose mass is changing in time as it consumes its fuel .",
    "as far as we know , the dissipative force due to the rocket term has not been considered in the context of r - mode oscillations . in the hydrodynamical equations corresponding to the mass conservation laws ,",
    "it is in general assumed that the neutron , proton and electron components are separately conserved quantities . assuming that the change in the particle densities is due to out of equilibrium direct urca processes , we have determined the typical timescale associated with the rocket effect and we have found that it is sufficiently short to damp countermoving r - mode oscillations , with the normal and superfluid component oscillating out of phase .",
    "for a system consisting of neutrons , protons and electrons , the mass conservation law is given by , see _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle mass creation rate per unit volume and the index @xmath2 refer to the particle species , that is , neutrons , protons and electrons . in these equations",
    "we have considered that some process can convert neutrons in protons and electrons and _ vice versa_. therefore , we are assuming that the various components are not separately conserved .",
    "one possible mechanism leading to a change in the particle number densities is the _ crust - core transfusion _ , a process that may take place when the ionic constituent of the crust are squeezed by the underlying superfluid and part of their hadronic content is released and augments the superfluid component .",
    "the opposite mechanism , related to a reduction of the pressure leads to the capture of protons and neutrons by the ions of the crust .",
    "a different mechanism leading to a change in the particle number densities is the direct urca process @xmath3 it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , that for certain realistic equations of state the direct urca processes are allowed when the star density exceeds the nuclear saturation density @xmath4 g @xmath5 , and the proton fraction exceeds the threshold value @xmath6 .",
    "we shall restrict to consider such processes which might be realized in the interior of massive neutron stars .",
    "it is possible to simplify the treatment of the system considering that electrons and protons are locked together by the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "thus they move with the same velocity .",
    "moreover , charge neutrality implies that @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , electrons and protons can be treated as a single charge - neutral fluid and henceforth we shall refer to this fluid as the `` charged '' component .",
    "the two fluids have mass densities @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the euler equations obeyed by the two fluids are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitational potential , @xmath14 label the space components ; we have defined a chemical potential by mass @xmath15 , and @xmath16 represents the relative velocity between the two fluids .",
    "the quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the entrainment parameters , that are related to the fact that momenta and velocities of quasiparticles may not be aligned  @xcite .    the term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eul - proton ] ) is given by @xmath19 and represents the rocket term .",
    "in the analysis of the possible dissipative mechanisms of star oscillations this term is usually neglected .",
    "indeed , it is in general assumed that the neutron , proton and electron numbers are separately conserved quantities , that is @xmath20 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have considered the effect of this term and obtained the corresponding damping timescale , assuming that the change in the number densities is due to direct urca processes .      in our analysis we have considered two different r - mode oscillations .",
    "one is associated predominantly with toroidal comoving displacements of the normal and superfluid components of the system .",
    "the second type of r - mode oscillation is dominated by toroidal countermoving ( out of phase ) displacements of the two components .",
    "we refer to these oscillations as  standard \" r - modes and as  superfluid \" r - modes , respectively .",
    "these two modes decouple for a star made by uniform and incompressible matter , and we shall restrict to treat such a case .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied the linearized hydrodynamical equations for the perturbations around an equilibrium configuration of a neutron star rotating with constant angular velocity @xmath21 , and we assume that the background configuration is such that the two fluids move with the same velocity , thus at equilibrium @xmath22 .        in fig .  [ fig : tau0vsepsilon ] we report the damping timescale associated to the rocket effect as a function of the entrainment parameter @xmath28 , see ref .",
    "@xcite , for standard r - modes .",
    "the typical timescale of gravitational wave emission is of the order of tens of seconds , therefore the rocket effect is not able to efficiently damp these oscillations .    , with radius @xmath24 km and mass @xmath29 .",
    "the dashed red line represents the instability window in the absence of the rocket term .",
    "the full blue line represents the instability window with the inclusion of the rocket term .",
    "the horizontal full lines correspond to the effect of the mutual friction for @xmath30 , lower line , and @xmath31 upper line . in our simplified model of star ,",
    "the mutual friction is independent of the temperature . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : instability ] we report the results for the superfluid r - mode  instability window \" for a star with uniform density , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 km .",
    "it is obtained comparing the various dissipative timescales with the growth timescale of gravitational wave radiation .",
    "stars above the various lines are unstable .",
    "the dashed red line represents the instability window in the absence of the rocket effect .",
    "the region above the dashed red line is unstable when only shear and bulk viscosity damping are considered . at low temperature , shear viscosity is the dominant dissipative mechanism .",
    "with increasing temperature shear viscosity is less efficient and it can damp r - mode oscillations for smaller and smaller values of the frequency .",
    "the behavior of the bulk viscosity is the opposite and starts to damp r - mode oscillations for temperatures of the order of @xmath34 k. the full blue line represents the effect of the rocket term .",
    "it has a behavior qualitatively similar to the bulk viscosity , but it becomes effective at smaller temperatures .",
    "therefore , the instability window with the inclusion of the rocket term is much reduced .",
    "the full horizontal lines correspond to the effect of mutual friction , see e.g.  @xcite , for two different values of the entrainment parameter .",
