    "fundamental properties of supranuclear matter in the cores of neutron stars , such as the equation of state and critical temperatures of baryon superfluidity , are still poorly known . in particular , they can be studied ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) by comparing the theory of cooling isolated neutron stars with observations of thermal radiation ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) from these stars .",
    "in this paper we study the cooling of superfluid neutron stars with the cores composed of neutrons , protons , electrons , and muons .",
    "we employ model equations of state ( eoss ) of neutron star cores based on the eos of akmal , pandharipande & ravenhall ( 1998 ) ( apr , section 4 ) which is currently assumed to be the most elaborated eos .",
    "it opens the powerful direct urca process of neutrino emission @xcite in neutron stars with masses slightly lower than the maximum mass .",
    "our cooling models will be based on standard ( nucleon ) composition of neutron stars and standard neutrino processes ( no `` exotic '' physics involved ) .",
    "the paper extends our previous studies ( @xcite and @xcite ; hereafter paper  i and paper  ii , respectively ) of cooling neutron stars with superfluid nucleon cores , where the direct urca process is forbidden . in this scenario ,",
    "observations of cold neutron stars ( e.g. , of the vela pulsar ) are explained by the enhanced neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of neutrons in neutron star cores .",
    "@xcite , who suggested a similar cooling scenario , called it `` minimal cooling '' .",
    "note , however , that the realization of this scheme by page et al .  and in papers i and ii is different ( see paper ii for details ) .    in papers  i and ii we employed the eos of @xcite ( the dh eos , which forbids the direct urca process in all stars ) and a model of triplet - state neutron pairing with the maximum of the critical temperature @xmath5  k in the inner stellar core .",
    "this pairing is needed to produce an enhanced neutrino cooling of massive stars and explain the observations of neutron stars coldest for their age ( such as the vela pulsar ) . in paper",
    "i we assumed also strong singlet - state proton pairing in the outer stellar core , with @xmath6  k. it slows down the cooling of low - mass neutron stars and enables us to interpret the observations of stars warmest for their age ( e.g. , rx j08224300 or psr b105552 ) . in paper",
    "ii we included the effects of surface ( accreted ) envelopes of light elements .",
    "they allowed us to explain the observations of warmest stars assuming weaker proton pairing ( @xmath7  k ) .",
    "now we will add the effect of the direct urca process in most massive stars in accordance with the apr eos .",
    "we will use similar ( but slightly different ) models for strong proton pairing and moderate neutron pairing in the stellar core .",
    "these superfluid models are sufficient to explain current observations of all cooling neutron stars without opening the direct urca process . however",
    ", most massive stars predicted by the apr eos can be much colder than the stars observed today and , we will focus on their properties .",
    "for simplicity , we will neglect the effects of accreted envelopes .",
    "they are unimportant for massive neutron stars ; we could easily include them as in paper ii .",
    "table  1 summarizes the observations of isolated ( cooling ) middle - aged neutron stars ( @xmath8  yr @xmath9 yr ) , whose thermal surface radiation has been detected or constrained .",
    "we present the estimated stellar ages @xmath10 and the effective surface temperatures @xmath11 ( redshifted for a distant observer ) . the data are described in paper  i and slightly corrected in paper  ii .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig3 ] shows the pressure - density ( left ) and the mass - central density ( right ) diagrams for all five eoss . according to the left panel , all eoss are similar .",
    "the @xmath12 curves intersect in one point , @xmath13  g  @xmath14",
    ". however , small differences in the eoss lead to noticeable differences in neutron star configurations , particularly , in the mass - density relations @xmath15 ( the right panel ) . corresponding proton fractions and direct urca thresholds are also different ( table  2 and fig .  1 ) .",
    "in contrast to the cooling scenarios in papers  i and ii we use the eos which opens the direct urca process in massive neutron stars . moreover , contrary to our older cooling scenarios ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) the direct urca process is now open at densities at which proton superfluidity dies out ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , in agreement with some recent calculations of proton pairing in dense matter ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows a family of cooling curves similar to that in fig .",
    "it is calculated for the same models of proton and neutron pairing ( p and nt , fig .  1 )",
    "but adopting the apr i eos .",
    "the curves show the cooling of neutron stars with masses from 1.01 to @xmath16 .",
    "the density of cooling curves reflects the probability to detect such stars provided the mass distribution of stars is flat in the indicated mass range ( and observational selection effects are absent ) .",
    "stars with @xmath17 would have temperatures nearly in the same range as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( see section 3 ) . by opening the direct urca",
    "we get a new but rare population of very cold neutron stars ( @xmath18 ) . taking into account the difficulties to detect such stars ,",
    "the chances to observe them are really low . notice that if the eos would allow higher @xmath19 we could obtain a new dense bunch of curves for very cold stars with @xmath20 .",
    "the same effects are demonstrated in fig .",
    "it shows @xmath11 versus @xmath21 ( left ) or @xmath22 ( right ) for stars of the vela pulsar age , @xmath23 yrs .",
    "we present the curves for superfluid stars with the eoss apr  i , ii , and iii .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines give the observational limits of @xmath11 for the vela pulsar .",
    "one can see a very sharp fall of @xmath11 in the narrow mass range from @xmath24 to @xmath25 for the apr  i eos and especially for apr  ii .",
    "this fall is naturally associated with the strong enhancement of the neutrino luminosity by the direct urca process .",
    "the case of arp  iii is different . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the threshold of opening the direct urca process is placed now in a wide region near the maximum of the critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "when the internal stellar temperature falls noticeably below @xmath2 in some region of @xmath26 , the suppression of the direct urca process by neutron superfluidity becomes important and smears out the dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath21 .",
    "the similar effect of partial suppression of the direct urca process by superfluidity was discussed by @xcite .",
    "evidently , the level of this suppression is regulated by the strength and density range of neutron pairing and by the threshold density of the direct urca process . were neutron superfluidity absent ( the thin long - dashed line ) , the dependence would be as sharp as for the eoss arp  i and  ii .    the dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath22 ( the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) is similar to the dependence on @xmath21 .",
    "note only much smoother dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath22 in the lower parts of the curves ; small variations of @xmath27 correspond to larger variations of @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] is similar to figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] and shows cooling curves calculated for the apr  iii eos and the same models for proton and neutron pairing ( p and nt ) .",
    "neutron star masses range from 1.01 to @xmath28 . a sharp lower boundary of the densely covered domain corresponds to the direct urca threshold @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we now obtain a representative ( densely populated ) family of middle - aged neutron stars with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "they are much colder than stars with @xmath32 but much hotter than those with @xmath20 .",
    "they appear owing to the flattening of the dependence @xmath11 on @xmath21 by neutron superfluidity ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . were this cooling scenario realized in the nature",
    ", the chances to detect such stars would be higher than for the scenario in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    the comparison of figs .  [ fig4 ] and",
    "[ fig6 ] shows a slight increase of the gap between the lower boundary @xmath33 of densely populated family of neutron stars with @xmath32 and the observed surface temperature of the vela pulsar .",
    "this difference is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ; the curves @xmath34 and @xmath35 merge in nearly the same slowly decreasing function before the direct urca thresholds ( @xmath32 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "we have extended the scenario of neutron star cooling proposed in papers  i and ii to the class of eoss which allow the operation of the powerful direct urca process in the cores of massive stars .",
    "it widens possible interpretations of observational data on thermal emission from isolated middle - aged neutron stars using simplest models of neutron star cores composed of nucleons , electrons , and muons .",
    "the main common feature of our present scenario and the scenarios of papers  i and ii is that the enhanced neutrino emission , required for the interpretation of observations of coldest neutron stars , is produced by cooper pairing of neutrons .",
    "this puts stringent constraints ( paper  i ) on the density dependence of the critical temperature @xmath2 for triplet - state neutron pairing . tuning our phenomenological model of @xmath2",
    "we have obtained a noticeable dependence of cooling on neutron star mass @xmath21 .    in the scenario of paper  i",
    "we have also needed strong proton pairing in the outer cores of neutron stars to explain the observations of neutron stars hottest for their age . in paper",
    "ii we have extended that scenario taking into account a possible presence of accreted envelopes and singlet - state pairing of neutrons in the stellar crust .",
    "we have shown that the presence of accreted envelopes allows us to take weaker proton pairing .",
    "note , that models of weaker pairing are consistent with recent microscopic calculations of proton critical temperatures ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although some other calculations predict much stronger proton pairing ( e.g. , @xcite ; also see references in @xcite , and a recent paper by @xcite ) .    in this paper , for simplicity",
    ", we use the model of strong proton pairing in the stellar core .",
    "however , following paper  ii , we could assume the presence of accreted envelopes , which would again allow us to weaken proton pairing .",
    "adopting moderately strong proton pairing ( with @xmath7  k ) we could interpret the observations of neutron stars warmest for their age .",
    "the main feature of this paper is the consideration of eoss which open the direct urca process in central layers ( @xmath37  g  @xmath14 ) of most massive stars .",
    "we have employed the parameterization of the eos of @xcite proposed by @xcite . in combination with properly chosen phenomenological models for strong proton pairing ( @xmath6  k at @xmath38  g  @xmath14 ) and moderate neutron pairing ( @xmath39  k at @xmath37  g  @xmath14 ) it allows us to predict new types of cooling neutron stars , in addition to those given by the cooling scenario without any direct urca process ( papers  i and ii , sect .",
    "they are rapidly cooling neutron stars with masses higher than the direct urca threshold mass @xmath40 .",
    "we have shown ( section 4 ) that the family of these stars can be either rarely populated ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and thus difficult to discover , or rather distinct and populated ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , depending on the choice of a model eos of dense matter and a model for neutron superfluidity .",
    "neutron stars from the distinct class could be cold but much warmer than massive stars with the fully open direct urca process .",
    "there is no clear evidence for the existence of such cold stars at the moment but it may appear in the future .",
    "for instance , low upper limits on thermal emission from hypothetical neutron stars in a few supernova remnants @xcite can be treated as an indirect indication of the existence of such cold stars . in this context",
    "the new scenario would allow one to explain the existence of these cold objects ( if discovered ) in the frame of standard and simple physics of dense matter ( without assuming the presence of hyperons and/or exotic forms of matter , such as pion / kaon condensates or quarks ) .",
    "as has already been emphasized , we need neutron pairing to explain the current observations of stars coldest for their age .",
    "however , according to @xcite , cooling curves are not too sensitive to exchanging @xmath41 in neutron star cores .",
    "therefore , we would also be able to explain the data assuming strong neutron pairing and moderate proton pairing in stellar cores .    finally , let us note that the same physics of neutron star interiors , which is tested by observations of isolated ( cooling ) neutron stars , can also be tested by observations of accreting neutron stars in soft x - ray transients ( e.g. , yakovlev , levenfish & haensel 2003 ) basing on the hypothesis of deep crustal heating of such stars @xcite by pycnonuclear reactions in accreted matter @xcite . the observations of soft x - ray transients in quiescent states indicate ( yakovlev , levenfish & gnedin 2005 ) the existence of rather cold neutron stars ( first of all , sax j1808.43658 ) inconsistent with the minimal model of cooling neutron stars .",
    "although these observations are currently inconclusive ( e.g. , @xcite ) , if confirmed in future observations , they could give an evidence in favor of the cooling scenario proposed in this paper .",
