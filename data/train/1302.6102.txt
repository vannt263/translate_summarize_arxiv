    "functional data analysis has grown into a comprehensive and useful field of statistics which provides a convenient framework to handle some high  dimensional data structures , including curves and images .",
    "the monograph of @xcite has done a lot to introduce its ideas to the statistics community and beyond .",
    "several other monographs and thousands of papers followed .",
    "this paper focuses on a specific aspect of the mathematical foundations of functional data analysis , which is however of fairly central importance .",
    "we first describe the contribution of this paper in broad terms , and provide some more detailed background and discussion in the latter part of this section .",
    "perhaps the most important , and definitely the most commonly used , tool for dimension reduction of functional data is the principal component analysis .",
    "suppose we observe a sample of functions , @xmath8 , and denote by @xmath9 the scores of the @xmath10 with respect to the estimated functional principal components @xmath11 .",
    "the scores @xmath12 depend on two variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and to reflect the infinite  dimensional nature of the data , it may be desirable to consider asymptotics in which both @xmath3 and @xmath0 increase . this paper establishes results that allow us to study the two  dimensional partial sum process @xmath13 more specifically , we derive a uniform normal approximation and apply it to two problems related to testing the null hypothesis that all observed curves have the same mean function .",
    "we obtain new test statistics in which the number of the functional principal components , @xmath0 , increases slowly with the sample size @xmath3 .",
    "we hope that our general approach will be used to derive similar results in other settings .",
    "statistical procedures for functional data which use functional principal components ( fpc s ) often depend on the number @xmath0 of the components used to compute various statistics .",
    "the selection of an optimal @xmath0 has received a fair deal of attention .",
    "commonly used approaches include the cumulative variance method , the scree plot , and several forms of cross  validation and pseudo information criteria . by now , most of these approaches are implemented in several r packages and in the matlab package pace . a related direction of research has focused on the identification of the dimension @xmath0 assuming that the functional data actually live in a finite  dimensional space of this dimension , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the research presented in this paper is concerned with functional data which can not be reduced to finite  dimensional data in an obvious and easy way .",
    "such data are typically characterized by a slow decay of the eigenvalues of the empirical covariance operator .",
    "figure  [ fig:3b ] shows the eigenvalues of the empirical covariance operator of the annual temperature curves obtained over the period 18562011 in melbourne , australia , while figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the cumulative variance plot for the same data set .",
    "it is seen that the eigenfunctions decay at a slow rate , and neither their visual inspection nor the analysis of cumulative variance provide a clear guidance on how to select @xmath0 .",
    "this data set is analyzed in greater detail in section  [ s : stefan ] .    in situations",
    "when the choice of @xmath0 is difficult , two approaches seem reasonable . in the first approach",
    ", one can apply a test using several values of @xmath0 in a reasonable range . if the conclusion does not depend on @xmath0",
    ", we can be confident that it is correct .",
    "this approach has been used in applied research , see @xcite for a recent analysis of this type .",
    "the second approach , would be to let @xmath0 increase with the sample size @xmath3 , and derive a test statistic based on the limit . in a sense ,",
    "the second approach is a formalization of the first one because if a limit as @xmath14 exists , then the conclusions should not depend on the choice of @xmath0 , if it is reasonably large . in the fda community",
    "there is a well grounded intuition that @xmath0 should increase much slower than @xmath3 , so asymptotically large @xmath0 need not be very large in practice .",
    "it is also known that the rate at which @xmath0 increases should depend on the manner in which the eigenvalues decay .",
    "we obtain specific conditions that formalize this intuition in the framework we consider . in more specific settings , contributions in this directions",
    "were made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite is more closely related to our research : as part of the justification of their testing procedure , they establish conditions under which a limiting chi ",
    "square distribution with @xmath0 degrees of freedom can be approximated by a normal distribution as @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite are concerned with a test of the equality of the covariance operators in two samples of gaussian curves . in the supplemental material",
    ", they derive asymptotics in which @xmath0 is allowed to increase with the sample size .",
    "our theory is geared toward testing the equality of mean functions , but we do not assume the normality of the functional observations , so we can not use arguments that use the equivalence of independence and zero covariances .",
    "we develop a new technique based on the estimation of the prokhorov ",
    "lvy distance between the underlying processes and the corresponding normal partial sums .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s :",
    "approx ] , we set the framework and state a general normal approximation result in theorem  [ approx ] .",
    "this result is then used in sections [ s : cp ] and [ s : two - s ] to derive , respectively , change  point and two  sample tests based on an increasing number of fpc s .",
    "section  [ s : stefan ] contains a small simulation study and an application to the annual melbourne temperature curves .",
    "all proofs are collected in the appendices .",
    "we consider functional observations @xmath16 defined over a compact interval @xmath17 .",
    "we can and shall assume without loss of generality that @xmath18 $ ] . throughout the paper , we use the notation @xmath19 and @xmath20 all functions we consider will be elements of the hilbert space @xmath21 of square integrable functions on @xmath22 $ ] .    in the testing problems that motivate this research , under the null hypothesis ,",
    "the observations follow the model @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the common mean .",
    "we impose the following standard assumptions .",
    "[ as-1 ] @xmath26 are independent and identically distributed .",
    "[ as-2 ] @xmath27 and @xmath28    under these assumptions , the covariance function @xmath29 is square integrable on the unit square and therefore it has the representation @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the eigenvalues and @xmath32 are the orthonormal eigenfunctions of the covariance operator , i.e. they satisfy the integral equation [ eq - eig ] _",
    "j v_j(t)=(t , s)v_j(s)ds .",
    "one of the most important dimension reduction techniques of functional data analysis is to project the observations @xmath33 onto the space spanned by @xmath34 , the eigenfunctions associated with the @xmath0 largest eigenvalues",
    ". since the covariance function @xmath35 , and therefore @xmath34 , are unknown , we use the empirical eigenfunctions @xmath36 and eigenvalues @xmath37 defined by [ eq - eigemp ] _ j _ j(t)=_n(t , s)_j(s)ds , where @xmath38 with @xmath39    in this section , we require only two more assumptions , namely    [ as-5]@xmath40    [ as-6]@xmath41    assumption  [ as-5 ] is needed to ensure that the fpc s @xmath42 are uniquely defined . in theorem  [ approx ]",
    "it could , of course , be replaced by requiring only that the first @xmath0 eigenvalues are positive and different , but since in the applications we let @xmath14 , we just assume that all eigenvalues are positive and distinct . if @xmath43 for some @xmath44 , then the observations are in the linear span of @xmath45 , i.e. they are elements of a @xmath44dimensional space , so in this case we can not consider @xmath46 .",
    "assumption [ as-5 ] means that the observations are in an infinite  dimensional space .",
    "assumption  [ as-6 ] is weaker than the usual assumption @xmath47 .",
    "as will be seen in the proofs , subtle arguments of the probability theory in banach spaces are needed to dispense with the fourth moment .    to state the main result of this section , define @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the transpose of vectors and matrices .",
    "set [ n - sum ] s_j , n(x)=_i=1^nx_i , j ,  0x 1 ,  1j d.    we now provide an approximation for the partial sum processes @xmath50 defined in ( [ n - sum ] ) with suitably constructed wiener processes ( standard brownian motions ) .",
    "[ approx ] if assumptions [ as-1 ] , [ as-5 ] and [ as-6 ] hold , then for every @xmath3 we can define independent wiener processes @xmath51 such that @xmath52 where @xmath53 only depends on @xmath54 and @xmath55    the constant @xmath56 in is not crucial , it is a result of our calculations .",
    "theorem  [ approx ] is related to the results of einmahl ( @xcite , @xcite ) who obtained strong approximations for partial sums of independent and identically distributed random vectors with zero mean and with identity covariance matrix . in our setting , for any fixed @xmath0 , the covariance matrix is not the identity , but this is not the central difficulty .",
    "the main value of theorem  [ approx ] stems from the fact that it shows how the rate of the approximation depends on @xmath0 ; no such information is contained in the work of einmahl ( @xcite , @xcite ) , who did not need to consider the dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the explicit dependence of the right hand side of on @xmath0 is crucial in the applications presented in the following sections in which the dimension of the projection space depends on the sample size @xmath3 .    very broadly speaking",
    ", theorem  [ approx ] implies that in all reasonable statistics based on averaging the scores , even in those based on an increasing number of fpc s , the partial sums of scores can be replaced by wiener processes to obtain a limit distribution .",
    "the right hand side of allows us to derive assumptions on the eigenvalues required to obtain a specific result . replacing the unobservable scores @xmath4 by the sample scores @xmath12 is relatively easy .",
    "we will illustrate these ideas in sections [ s : cp ] and [ s : two - s ] .",
    "over the past four decades , the investigation of the asymptotic properties of partial sum processes has to a large extent been motivated by change ",
    "point detection procedures , and this is the most natural application of theorem  [ approx ] . the research on the change ",
