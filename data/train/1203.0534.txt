    ". the numerical grid resolution might be marginal for resolving relevant details of the penumbra , the initial condition in terms of a monolithic axisymmetric field is very artificial , and there is a strong influence from the ( unavoidable ) imposed boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , in this paper we investigate numerical resolution and boundary conditions .",
    "we also deepen our discussion on the flow field and magnetic structure in the observable layers of the penumbra . at the bottom boundary",
    "most of the sunspot simulations impose a fixed magnetic field to prevent a rapid decay of the sunspot .",
    "@xcite showed that this constraint can be relaxed in sufficiently deep domains where convective time scales reach several days , but not in shallow @xmath1  mm deep domains typically used in simulations that address sunspot fine structure . here",

    "we deepen the analysis presented in @xcite to test the numerical robustness of their findings .",
    "in addition we expand the discussion to address three aspects that have been subject to major controversy in recent years :    \\(1 ) _ the convective nature of the penumbra : _ vigorous convection ( about half the strength of granulation ) is the key process in mhd simulations leading to penumbral fine structure .",
    "indirect observational evidence for overturning motions is derived from twisting motions @xcite or correlation tracking that shows the convergence of tracers toward the edge of filaments similar to granulation @xcite .",

    "@xcite found consistent results using the ci 5380 and fei 6301 lines in terms of an anisotropic convection pattern with a correlation between intensity and vertical flow velocity not very different from quiet sun .",

    "some models suggest that penumbral filaments are mostly field free gaps @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion was also derived from an interpretation of twisting filament motions as fluting instability @xcite , leading to an upper bound for magnetic field in flow channels of about @xmath4  g. mhd simulations however point toward strong @xmath5 kg field in flow channels , in the outer penumbra the field is even enhanced in flow channels compared to the background @xcite .",
    "the numerical models were computed with an expanded version of the _ muram _ radiative mhd code @xcite .",
    "we introduced an artificial limitation of alfvn velocities to @xmath6  km s@xmath7 in order to prevent severe cfl time step constraints and implemented a new numerical diffusivity approach , both are described in @xcite . for the simulations presented here with grid sizes of up to @xmath8 billion grid points we did additional performance enhancements including a major rewrite of io and improved the scalability of the code to up to @xmath9 cores .",
    "most of the simulations presented here were computed in the @xmath10 core range .",
    "we present here a series of numerical sunspot models which were all computed in a domain with a size of @xmath11 mm@xmath12 .",
    "all models were initialized with an axisymmetric self - similar magnetic field configuration described in appendix a. for the models presented here we used the parameters @xmath13 kg , @xmath14 mm , and @xmath15 mm , leading to a sunspot with an initial flux of @xmath16 mx , a field strength of @xmath13 kg at the bottom of our domain ( @xmath17 mm ) , dropping to @xmath18 kg at the top ( @xmath19 mm ) .    while keeping this initial condition fixed we explore the dependence of the resulting sunspots on the top boundary condition and grid resolution .",
    "we use in the horizontal direction periodic boundaries , the bottom boundary condition is open for convective flows in regions with @xmath20 kg , but closed otherwise . the open boundary condition imposes a symmetric mass flux ( all three components ) in the ghost cells and extrapolates the gas pressure such that its value at the boundary is fixed . in outflow regions the entropy is determined by the upstream values from within the computational domain , in inflow regions the entropy is set to a fixed value that leads to the correct solar energy flux under quiet sun conditions . the closed boundary condition in regions with @xmath21 kg",
    "is implemented through an antisymmetric mass flux .",
    "the top boundary condition is closed ( vertical mass flux antisymmetric ) and stress free for horizontal motions .    for the magnetic field we use a boundary condition that allows us to manipulate the inclination angle of the magnetic field .",
    "we focus on a single sunspot , which implies that the horizontal boundary imposes same polarity spots nearby and one thus produces only a very subdued penumbra @xcite .",
    "a relaxation of the horizontal periodicity is non - trivial and we thus decided to use a boundary that allows to control the inclination angle of the magnetic field to mimic different global field configurations , which is described in detail in appendix b. a free parameter , @xmath22 , gives for @xmath23 a potential field extrapolation subject to horizontal periodicity , i.e. the field becomes vertical asymptotically .",
    "values of @xmath24 lead to more horizontally inclined field , i.e. the horizontal field component is approximately enhanced by a factor of @xmath22 compared to the potential field reference .",
    "the resulting field extrapolations are for @xmath25 not force free outside the computational domain .",
    "they are not intended to give a realistic description for the global field topology above a sunspot , rather to explore the influence of different field geometries on the structure of a sunspot penumbra .",
    "all of the simulations presented here were computed with gray radiative transfer . to allow for a better comparison with observations through forward modeling of spectral lines we computed 2 non - gray models that are derived from the gray simulations .",
    "we have a non - gray version of the simulation with @xmath26 $ ] km grid resolution that was advanced for 26 minutes and we have a non - gray model with @xmath27 $ ] km resolution that was restarted from the upper half of our @xmath28 $ ] km case and advanced for 15 minutes . the non - gray model with @xmath26 $ ] km was analyzed by @xcite , more results will be presented in forthcoming publications .    in the following analysis",
    "we will focus entirely on the gray simulations and discuss penumbral structure mostly through quantities extracted on constant @xmath29 surfaces . in figure [ fig : f0 ]",
    "we display a snapshot from our highest resolution gray simulation ( @xmath28 $ ] km ) that we consider in this paper .",
    "the simulation was computed with the @xmath30 boundary condition and evolved for @xmath31 hour at the highest resolution .",
    "in figure [ fig : f1 ] we show 4 sunspot models computed with the boundary conditions @xmath32 .",
    "the case @xmath23 ( lower right quadrant ) leads to a very subdued penumbra with a few isolated filaments , which is consistent with the penumbra structure that was found in @xcite in the direction where the periodicity imposes the same polarity sunspots .",
    "the other three cases show more developed penumbrae , the overall radial extent increases with the value of @xmath22 . in figure",
    "[ fig : f2 ] we show azimuthal averages of ( a ) intensity , ( b ) evershed flow , ( c ) vertical and radial magnetic field , and ( d ) inclination angle .",
    "these quantities are in addition averaged for about 1 hour in time .",
    "apart from the monotonic increase of the penumbra extent with @xmath22 , it is also evident that the most dramatic differences occur between the the potential field case ( @xmath23 ) and the other three cases with @xmath24 . for @xmath23",
    "the azimuthally averaged radial flow velocity stays around @xmath33  m@xmath34s@xmath7 , while all other cases have outflows with more than @xmath35  km@xmath34s@xmath7 on average .",
    "similarly the curves for the radial magnetic field as well as inclination angle do not differ as much between the @xmath24 cases as compared to @xmath23 and the rest .",
    "while the potential field case reaches only an average inclination of @xmath36 , all the other solutions with more extended penumbra and evershed flow reach about @xmath37 .",
    "this leads to the surprising conclusion that the potential field case ( which is the only physical , i.e. force free solution outside the computational domain ) is a clear outlier compared to the rest .",
    "this result has to be seen in the context of horizontal periodicity , which is not the proper horizontal boundary condition to describe the magnetic field above sunspots",
    ". a more reasonable ( but computationally more difficult to implement ) boundary condition would be the free expansion of magnetic field into a half room ( perhaps considering in addition spherical geometry ) , which would lead naturally to a magnetic field with stronger horizontal field components .",
    "the boundary conditions with @xmath24 emulate that behavior while maintaining horizontal periodicity .",
    "note that simply increasing the horizontal extent of the domain for @xmath23 does not alleviate this problem , since the field remains asymptotically vertical . for the following investigation",
    "we will use a top boundary condition with @xmath30 .",
    "we modify the numerical grid resolution in the range from @xmath38 $ ] to @xmath28 $ ]  km ( horizontal [ vertical ] resolution ) .",
    "the sunspot models computed with different grid resolutions are not fully independent from each other : the model with a resolution of @xmath0 $ ]  km resolution was started from a snapshot of the @xmath38 $ ]  km resolution simulation evolved for 1 hour and ran for an additional @xmath39 hours .",
    "the model with a resolution of @xmath26 $ ]  km resolution was started from a snapshot of the @xmath0 $ ]  km resolution run after 3.3 hours and ran for an additional 2.2 hours .",
    "the highest resolution case with @xmath28 $ ]  km resolution was started from the last snapshot of the @xmath26 $ ]  km case and evolved for an additional hour .",
    "overall we compare sunspot models that have been evolved for about @xmath40 hours from the initial state .",
    "we did not evolve the higher resolution cases for the full length of time because of their computational expense ( 1 hour at @xmath28 $ ]  km resolution , @xmath41 grid points , costs about 800,000 cpu hours on a cray xt-5 ) .",
    "for the small length and associated short time scales in the photosphere about @xmath31 hour at the highest resolution is sufficient to allow for the solution to adapt to the grid spacing .",
    "structures in the deeper parts of the domain are already well resolved at lower resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : f3 ] shows the ( gray ) intensity and magnetogram at @xmath42 ; figure [ fig : f4 ] shows the corresponding azimuthal averages of quantities at @xmath42 . overall there is no significant influence from grid resolution on the radial extent of the penumbra as well as the magnetic structure at @xmath42 , displayed in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "significant differences occur with regard to the average intensity profile and evershed flow shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "only the higher resolution cases show the formation of a plateau like feature at around @xmath43 in the inner penumbra .",
    "the average evershed flow speed is increasing monotonically with resolution from a peak at around @xmath44  km@xmath34s@xmath7 for @xmath38 $ ]  km resolution to about @xmath45  km@xmath34s@xmath7 for @xmath28 $ ]  km resolution .",
    "however , we see also here a clear sign of convergence : while the relative resolution changes from @xmath38 $ ] to @xmath0 $ ]  km and from @xmath26 $ ] to @xmath28 $ ]  km are the same , the relative changes in the peak flow velocities are @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the strong dependence of the evershed flow velocity on grid resolution is a consequence from the driving mechanism that is concentrated in a thin boundary layer just beneath @xmath42 @xcite , which is difficult to resolve numerically ( see also section [ sect : subsurf ] ) .",
    "the umbra is with @xmath48 rather bright for a sunspot with an umbral field strength exceeding @xmath35  kg . we return to this point in section [ sect : comment_diff ] .",
    "figure [ fig : f5 ] presents the penumbral fine structure at the @xmath42 level for our highest resolution case ( @xmath28 $ ]  km resolution ) .",
    "this figure is very similar to figure 3 in @xcite , in which we displayed the fine structure at @xmath26 $ ]  km resolution for the double sunspot simulation of @xcite .",
    "the large degree of similarity underlines that the details of fine structure are not very sensitive to the numerical setup .",
    "penumbral filaments show an enhancement of the radial magnetic field component ( panel b ) , while the vertical field component is strongly reduced ( panel c ) . in the outer penumbra",
    "we find a substantial amount of opposite polarity flux , which will be characterized further in section [ sect : polarity ] .",
    "the combination of a enhanced radial magnetic field component with a reduced vertical field component results in the uncombed structure of the penumbra with a strong variation of the field inclination angle ( panel d ) .",
    "fast horizontal ( evershed ) outflows are found along the almost horizontal stretches of magnetic field ( panel e ) .",
    "overturning convection ( panel f ) is the underlying driving mechanism , which will be characterized further in section [ sect : conv ] .",
    "we provide an animation of figure [ fig : f5 ] with the online version .",
    "figure [ fig : f6 ] presents the height dependence of the azimuthally averaged evershed flow and the vertical rms velocity . as already pointed out in @xcite , the evershed flow peaks in the deep photosphere and falls off rapidly with height",
    "; we see the transition to an inverse evershed flow at about @xmath49 .",
    "this figure is qualitatively very similar to the observations reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure 8 therein ) and by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : f6]b we show the height dependence of the vertical rms velocity .",
    "we find essentially a drop by a factor of @xmath50 between the @xmath42 and @xmath51 levels , but no further drop toward higher layers .      to characterize fine structure further and quantify the resolution dependence of quantities we present in figure [ fig : f7 ] correlations between the evershed flow velocity and ( a ) intensity , ( b ) magnetic field strength as well as ( c ) radial and ( d ) vertical magnetic field components .",
    "all correlations are computed based on fluctuations around a smooth background that was obtained through a convolution with a gaussian having a fwhm of @xmath52  mm . at @xmath42",
    "the evershed flow is found in the inner penumbra in bright features , whereas the correlation vanishes toward the outer penumbra ( panel a ) .",
    "a similar behavior was also found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the correlation between evershed flow and magnetic field strength is negative in the inner half , but positive in the outer half of the penumbra .",
    "an evershed flow in stronger magnetic field regions in the outer penumbra was also inferred by @xcite and @xcite from net circular polarization ( ncp ) variations with the viewing angle . the sign change in the @xmath53 correlation results from two effects : a positive correlation with the radial field component and a negative correlation with the vertical field component throughout the penumbra ( figure [ fig : f7]c , d ) .",
    "while the negative correlation with the vertical field dominates the inner penumbra , the positive correlation with the radial field component dominates the outer penumbra ( see also figure [ fig : f5 ] ) .",
    "except for the correlation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 that is with values about @xmath56 quite significant all others reach in the deep photosphere only moderate levels of up to @xmath57 .",
    "all correlations decay very rapidly with height .    to quantify the robustness of photospheric fine structure we focus now on the correlations at @xmath42 and study the resolution dependence in figure [ fig : f8 ] .",
    "the lowest resolution case ( @xmath38 $ ]  km ) somewhat misses the @xmath58 correlation in the inner and the @xmath53 correlation in the outer penumbra , all other grid resolutions produce comparable levels of correlations .",
    "we can conclude that the magneto - convection process underlying penumbral fine structure is well captured starting from a resolution of about @xmath0 $ ]  km .",
    "this resolution also produces an average evershed flow amplitude at this resolution that differs less than @xmath59 from our highest resolution case . as we will discuss in section [ sect : subsurf ] , the trend of increasing magnetic field in flow channels ( see @xmath60 correlation ) and the resolution dependence of the evershed flow have a common origin .",
    "the positive @xmath60 correlation throughout the penumbra increases in amplitude with increasing resolution , which strongly points toward an active process supporting strong horizontal field in the flow channels as opposed to remnant magnetic field due to unavoidable numerical diffusion effects as speculated by @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite that the horizontal field originates mostly from the horizontal shear in the sub - photospheric evershed flow , i.e. the term @xmath61 in the induction equation ( see section [ sect : subsurf ] ) .",
    "the robustness of this effect points toward a strongly magnetized evershed flow in photospheric layers as it has been inferred from spectropolarimetric observations ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result is not necessarily in contradiction to the gappy penumbra model of @xcite and @xcite since the strong horizontal magnetic field is confined to the thin boundary layer at @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath62 is in flow channels typically about a few 100  g stronger than in the background . in figure",
    "[ fig : f9 ] we present bivariate probability density function for @xmath54 and @xmath63 in the inner penumbra ( @xmath64 to @xmath65  mm ) in panel a ) and the outer penumbra ( @xmath66 to @xmath67  mm ) in panel b ) . in the inner penumbra we find field strength of up to @xmath68  kg in regions with low radial velocity , which correspond to the spines .",
    "fast outflows have field strength of more than @xmath50  kg , mostly due to @xmath69 .",
    "we see a similar behavior in the outer penumbra with reduced overall field strength and less pronounced spines , but also here fast outflows are associated with field strengths around @xmath50  kg .",
    "the extension toward low field strength is caused by a few granules present in the region @xmath70 . in both ,",
    "inner and outer penumbra , there is also a population of inflows with substantial field strength .",
    "we see also a trend for increasing @xmath63 with increasing outflow velocities ( @xmath71 ) .      inverse polarity magnetic flux embedded in the sunspot penumbra is an integral part of penumbral fine structure .",
    "due to the substantial amount of overturning convection ( see sect . [",
    "sect : conv ] ) a certain amount of magnetic field lines has to turn back into the photosphere within the penumbra .",
    "return flux along the outer penumbra rim was first found by @xcite and interpreted in the context of predictions from flux tube models such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "fast ( supersonic ) downflows and return flux in the interior of the penumbra were found by @xcite .",
    "substantial amounts of inverse polarity flux were deduced from observations by @xcite , which we will use as a reference for the analysis presented here .",
    "this subject is not without controversy , for example @xcite did not find much evidence in magnetograms at high spatial resolution .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : f10 ] and [ fig : f11 ] we quantify the amount of inverse polarity flux found in the penumbra .",

    "figure [ fig : f10 ] shows how these quantities change with optical depth in the range from @xmath42 to @xmath75 .",

    "we see an increase of the inverse polarity flux from abut @xmath78 to @xmath76 over the resolution range considered here ( about half of the spread is due to our lowest resolution run ) .",
    "we also find that more extended penumbrae tend to have more opposite polarity flux than less extended ones ( yellow dashed / dotted lines ) .",

    "we present here values computed for the highest resolution case .",
    "our simulated sunspot is about a factor of @xmath85 larger in terms of unsigned and a factor of @xmath50 larger in terms of signed flux . while we find a large degree of qualitative agreement with @xcite , the overall amount of inverse polarity flux falls short by a factor of about @xmath35 ( first line in table ) .",
    "we find a substantial amount of opposite polarity flux in the region @xmath86 , where the signed flux is @xmath87 of the unsigned flux .",

    "the inclination of flow and field agrees qualitatively with the findings of ( * ? ? ?",
    "they found that in locally bright features ( upflows ) inclination angles of flow and field agree very well , while the magnetic field was close to horizontal or weakly upward pointing in downflow regions ( locally dark features ) .",
    "@xcite concluded from hinode data that at least @xmath3 of penumbral downflows contain magnetic field with opposite polarity , similar to our finding .",

    "this relation means that about @xmath87 of the level of overturning convection found in the plage surrounding the sunspot is required to maintain an intensity of about @xmath153 typical for the inner penumbra .",

    "lower values for the amplitude of overturning motions would be only possible in combination with a substantially higher contrast to satisfy energy flux constraints .    while the overall amount of overturning convection as characterized by the vertical rms velocity is robust , there are differences in how much up- and downflows contribute .",
    "to characterize their contribution further we show in figure [ fig : f15]a ) the filling factors of regions with more than @xmath157  m@xmath34s@xmath7 upflow ( blue ) and less than @xmath158  m@xmath34s@xmath7 downflow velocity ( red ) . filling factors of up- and downflows are comparable in the plage region outside the sunspot with values of about @xmath159 .",
    "the outer penumbra shows a clear preference for downflows with filling factor of @xmath160 , while upflows occupy only @xmath105 of the area . in the inner penumbra",

    "this is mostly an optical depth effect since we show quantities on the @xmath42 surface .",
    "since up- and downflow velocity amplitude decline with height , the elevated @xmath29 levels in upflow regions sample lower velocities than the depressed @xmath29 levels in downflow regions , while the difference on a constant height surface is typically less pronounced .",
    "this `` apparent redshift '' is not to be confused with the well known convective blueshift that originates in unresolved observations from the different intensity weighting of up- and downflow regions dependent on the the temperature sensitivity of the considered spectral line . in the inner penumbra",
    "upflow velocities dominate over downflows by a factor of up to @xmath161 ( despite the fact that also here the elevated @xmath29 levels in upflow regions produce a bias toward downflows ) . for the currently explored resolution range",
    "we do not yet see a convergence of filling factors as well as mean up- and downflow velocities .",
    "it is likely that the trend toward upflow dominance in the inner penumbra will continue somewhat further with increasing resolution .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f16 ] we present the widths of intensity , up- and downflow features as function of radius . to this end",

    "for @xmath165 we obtain the regular average , while @xmath166 can be considered as an `` area weighted average '' if we make the assumption that the area of a feature scales with @xmath167 .",
    "figure [ fig : f16 ] shows in panel a ) @xmath168 and in panel b ) @xmath169 .",
    "regardless of the adopted measure we find that the widths of intensity and flow features are comparable in the plage region , while flow features are systematically smaller in the penumbra by a factor of up to 2 .",
    "we do not see convergence of @xmath168 with grid resolution ( we show here the @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ]  km cases by solid and dotted lines ) in neither penumbra nor plage due to small scale features that dominate by numbers in both regions .",
    "the area weighted average @xmath169 shows better convergence in particular for the width of intensity features .",
    "the most dramatic changes occur in flow features in the mid to outer penumbra .",
    "the latter indicates that even higher resolution than 16  km might be required to capture the width of flow features in the penumbra properly and that the current width of about 100 ( 200 )  km has to be considered as an upper limit for the average ( area weighted average ) width .    in figure",

    "interestingly , the correlation vanishes in the outer penumbra .",

    "this indicates that rather moderate values of the @xmath107 correlation in the photosphere can not be taken as an argument against convective energy transport , in particular not if strong magnetic field is present .",
    "in section [ sect : conv ] we discussed the correlation between intensity and vertical velocity .",

    "the pdfs are computed for absolute intensity values ( rather than fluctuations about the background ) to allow for a direct comparison of intensity values between penumbra and plage .",
    "comparing first the plage region and plage with @xmath181  g , we see that the moderate correlation of @xmath182 is mostly due to a population of very bright downflows that are associated with strong field .",
    "masking out these regions increases the correlation to @xmath183 .",
    "the correlation for the inner penumbra has a value of @xmath184 very close to that of plage , however , the shape of the pdf is substantially different . while the correlation in the plage regions results in about equal parts from bright upflows and dark downflows , it is in the inner penumbra mostly due to bright upflows , some with brightness values reaching @xmath185 .",
    "similarly to the plage region , the decorrelation in the outer penumbra is due to a strong population of bright downflows . in particular , most supersonic downflows have a brightness comparable to @xmath186 .",
    "most of these features have also strong opposite polarity magnetic field , indicating that the mechanism for the brightness enhancement is likely similar in penumbra and plage .",
    "the less pronounced tendency for downflows to be darker in the inner penumbra is in part due to the fact that the typical width of flow features is about half the width of intensity features according to figure [ fig : f16 ] .",
    "while the upflows are mostly located centrally in bright patches , downflows are located near the edge and are partially found in bright and dark features .",
    "computing the pdfs based on the vertical velocity at @xmath51 does not lead to any significant correlation in the penumbra , while the plage region shows values of @xmath187 and @xmath188 excluding strong field regions .",

    "the overall width of the pdf in the penumbra was about half of the value found in the quiet sun . while our results certainly show about a factor of 2 difference in the widths ( see also the vertical rms velocity in figure [ fig : f14 ] ) , other details might depend also on the utilized spectral line as well as resolution and require likely a comparison through forward modeling .",

    "the left panels ( a , d , g ) present averages of magnetic field , velocity and temperature .",
    "apart from the dramatic change of the evershed flow speed we also find that the enhancement of @xmath69 at @xmath42 is less pronounced at lower resolution , consistent with figure [ fig : f8 ] .",
    "the middle panels ( b , e , h ) show energy conversion terms that play a central role in the maintenance of the evershed flow .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite pressure buoyancy driving takes place in upflow regions , while downflows are close to hydrostatic , which is opposite to the situation in non - magnetic convection .",
    "the pressure driving in upflows is diverted by the magnetic field into the horizontal direction where the acceleration takes place , while the pressure force itself does not have a strong component in the horizontal direction . to quantify the influence from grid resolution on this process",

    "regardless of resolution we find the same balance , only the overall amplitudes of the various terms increase with increasing resolution . a quadratic increase with the peak evershed flow velocity",
    "is expected , since the acceleration term is given in leading order by @xmath203 and @xmath194 itself does not change with resolution ( tied to the fixed amount of energy transported ) .",
    "the panels on the right ( c , f , i ) show the contributions from the stretching term ( red ) advection term ( black ) and divergence term ( blue ) in the induction equation for the radial field component . here",
    "it is most striking that the stretching term and in particular the contributions from @xmath61 ( red , dashed ) triples in amplitude over the resolution range explored . as discussed in detail in @xcite",
    ", there is a strong connection between the evershed flow and the horizontal magnetic field in a thin boundary layer beneath the @xmath42 surface .",
    "the subsurface shear profile of the evershed flow induces strong horizontal field , which is distributed along the @xmath42 level by overturning convection and leads to a thin `` outer shell '' of the filament with strongly enhanced horizontal field .",
    "this boundary layer is also the place where strong magnetic tension forces are in balance with vertical pressure and horizontal acceleration forces ( see also figure [ fig : f21 ] ) .",
    "this strong linkage between @xmath69 and @xmath54 is also evident from figures [ fig : f4 ] and [ fig : f8 ] , in which both the evershed flow and horizontal magnetic field show the strongest resolution dependence with a trend toward faster flows and stronger field at higher resolution .",
    "we found a very strong influence of the magnetic top boundary condition on the extent of the penumbra .",
    "we do not obtain a penumbra at all using a potential field extrapolation since the horizontal periodicity implies an asymptotically vertical field .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier results by @xcite , who only found extended penumbrae in between nearby opposite polarity spots .",
    "this rather puzzling result requires further investigation , we see three possible implications :    \\1 .",
    "this result is entirely due to the horizontal periodicity that is chosen for computational convenience .    \\2 .",
    "other physical processes are still missing or a insufficiently resolved , like turbulent pumping as suggested by @xcite . while processes along the lines of turbulent pumping are certainly present in our simulations ( see , also * ? ? ? * ) and can be associated with the opposite polarity flux present in the outer penumbra , we did not find any indication of a strong resolution dependence here that would indicate that these processes could be underestimated .    \\3 .",
    "hysteresis from our initial state could prevent the formation of a penumbra . to test this we conducted additional experiments with a sunspot model similar to our @xmath0 $ ]  km resolution case ,",
    "but in a larger @xmath204  mm@xmath12 domain ( this model has been described also in @xcite ) . after running that simulation for a total of 24 hours of solar time with our @xmath30 boundary condition",
    ", we switched back to @xmath23 ( potential field ) . within about 30 minutes",
    "the entire penumbra including the associated evershed flow disappeared . after running for 2 hours with the potential field boundary condition we switched back to the @xmath30 case and the entire penumbra inclusive evershed flow reappeared in about 30 minutes with properties essentially identically to the previous .",
    "this indicates that there is no hysteresis from within the convection zone in our numerical setup .",
    "this is not necessarily in contradiction to observed hysteresis effects in sunspots if the hysteresis would be caused by the global overlying magnetic field structure .",
    "independent evidence against hysteresis from our initial state comes from flux emergence simulations @xcite , which also fail in producing a penumbra if a potential field boundary is used in a periodic domain .",
    "overall this indicates that the coronal magnetic field overlying sunspots has a potential feedback on penumbral structure .",
    "this has been proposed by @xcite , who observed changes in penumbral structure associated with solar flares .",
    "our simulations certainly indicate that such feedback is possible and that in response parts of penumbrae could disappear or form on a time scale of about 30 minutes",
    ". additional support for a key role of the magnetic field overlying the sunspot comes from @xcite , who discovered in a developing active region a chromospheric precursor of penumbra formation .",
    "they observed the formation of a magnetic canopy in the chromosphere before the penumbra formation took place in the photosphere .",
    "the penumbra reached in the end an extent similar to the previously observed chromospheric signature .",
    "their observation indicates that the magnetic field at chromospheric levels likely plays an active role in the penumbra formation process .",
    "overall we find that penumbral fine structure is robust with regard to grid resolution over the explored range from @xmath38 $ ] to @xmath28 $ ]  km .",
    "even our lowest resolution case ( which could be considered as an intentional experiment of under - resolving penumbral structure ) gives still a good qualitative agreement .",
    "quantitative agreement requires better than @xmath0 $ ]  km resolution .",
    "this agreement is in terms of the structure and correlations of quantities in the penumbra in particular evershed flow channels , opposite polarity magnetic flux and its relation to downflows , the level of overturning convection and the subsurface magneto convective processes responsible for the filamentation and driving of the evershed flow .",
    "all resolution levels considered are not sufficient to resolve turbulence within flow channels .",
    "however , we also find strong magnetization of evershed flow channels as a robust result .",
    "therefore it is doubtful that a substantial amount of turbulence would develop at photospheric levels .",
    "studies of sunspot penumbrae at higher resolution than considered here would be only meaningful if a nested or adaptive grid is used that allows for high local resolution , while the domain remains large enough to capture an entire sunspot .",
    "we do not use any explicit viscosity or magnetic resistivity in our simulations . the unavoidable hyper - diffusivity used is resolution and scale",
    "it scales at least linear with grid spacing near discontinuities or regions with monotonicity changes , but has higher order or is even switched off in well resolved regions .",
    "our experiments on numerical resolution implicitly explore the dependence of the solutions on hyper - diffusivities . from power spectra",
    "we estimate that hyper - diffusion affects mostly features that are resolved by less than 6 grid points or have a scale of less than @xmath205 km in our simulation with @xmath28 $ ]  km resolution .",
    "this is consistent with our findings that details of up- and downflow structures that exist on these scales in the penumbra are not fully converged yet .",
    "we found in our simulations a rather bright umbra of @xmath206 for a sunspot with @xmath207  kg central field strength ( see figure [ fig : f4 ] ) .",
    "further investigation shows that the umbral brightness is influenced to some degree by numerical diffusivities , in particular mass - diffusion .",
    "using a modified numerical approach with a lower mass - diffusion rate reduces the umbral brightness by @xmath208 .",
    "this difference is mostly due to a different number density of umbral dots as details of diffusivities influence the magnetic field threshold at which umbral dots become completely suppressed .",
    "we did not find a significant influence on other aspects of the solution .",
    "numerical mass - diffusion mimics to some degree the effects of ambipolar diffusion , which indicates that some detail of umbral dots could be influenced by multi - fluid effects .",
    "the vertical rms velocity depends very weakly on grid resolution , showing a very moderate increase with increasing grid resolution .",
    "the average downflow velocity is larger than the upflow velocity in plage and the outer penumbra ( by about a factor of @xmath52 ) , but in the inner penumbra upflows dominate over downflows by about a factor of @xmath161 . in the outer penumbra downflows",
    "have a substantially larger filling factor ( @xmath160 ) than upflows ( @xmath105 ) , while the upflow filling factor dominates in the inner penumbra by a small margin .",
    "these differences between up and downflow regions become more pronounced with higher grid resolution in the inner penumbra .",
    "the consequence of these asymmetries is that upflows ( downflows ) tend to be easier to observe in the inner ( outer ) penumbra , i.e. with insufficient observational resolution one should expect to see a pattern of upflows in the inner and downflows in the outer penumbra .",
    "that raises the question of what a sufficient observational resolution is in this context .",
    "@xcite used a non - gray version of the model in @xmath26 $ ]  km grid resolution to address this question through forward modeling .",
    "they focused mostly on a few filaments in the inner penumbra and found that the upflow would be clearly visible at @xmath209 observational resolution , while the visibility of the lateral downflows depends strongly on the spectral lines used .",
    "they found only @xmath210  m@xmath34s@xmath7 in the fe 7090 line , while the ci 5380 line yielded up to @xmath211  m@xmath34s@xmath7 downflow velocity .",
    "based on the results presented here these numbers are likely still on the optimistic side , since the azimuthal extent of flow structures is still decreasing with increasing grid resolution ( see figure [ fig : f16 ] ) and @xcite did not consider additional effects from stray light and potential line blends that complicate the situation in real observations . in that sense",
    "we do not see at this point a direct conflict with non - detection of overturning motions in penumbra filaments such as @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent observations in the ci 5380 line by @xcite found direct evidence for such motions , although their analysis depends strongly on stray light removal and complications due to the projection of the evershed flow on the line of sight .",
    "overall this indicates that observations are approaching the required resolution , which makes the outlook on the next generation solar telescopes such as _ nst _ , _ gregor _ and _ atst _ very promising .",
    "a recent example of new details that can be learned from comparing high resolution observations with state of the art numerical models was presented by @xcite using _ sunrise _ observations of the quiet sun .",
    "on the side of simulations the presence of overturning motions is robust as they are linked to very fundamental energy flux constraints .",
    "however , details still change , indicating that also here higher grid resolution will be required for an in depth comparison with observations through forward modeling . for the current simulations spectral line features that result from structures on scales of @xmath205  km or less",
    "should be interpreted with caution , since details are likely influenced by numerical diffusion .",
    "in deepening our previous studies in @xcite we investigated how boundary conditions and grid resolution affect the structure of penumbrae in simulated sunspots and worked out observational consequences that can help to further constrain the magneto - convective structure of the penumbra .",
    "the main findings are the following :    1 .   the magnetic top boundary condition appears to determine the radial extent of the penumbra .",
    "we do not get an extended penumbra if we impose a potential field subject to horizontal periodicity .",
    "thus , simulations in periodic domains can not predict the extent of penumbrae from first principles at this point .",
    "magneto convection forming penumbral fine structure and driving the evershed flow is robust over the explored resolution range .",
    "while all explored grid resolutions reproduce basic aspects of a penumbra , a resolution of at least @xmath212 $ ]  km ( horizontal [ vertical ] ) is required for a quantitative agreement .",
    "the overall amount of convective motions in the photosphere as characterized by the vertical rms velocity shows little dependence on resolution and extent of the penumbra .",
    "it is linked to the intensity through an approximate relation of the form @xmath213 .",
    "we find asymmetries between upflow / downflow filling factors and velocities that favor the detection of upflows in the inner and downflows in the outer penumbra .",
    "these asymmetries become more pronounced at higher resolution . forward modeling",
    "likely overestimates the visibility of a convective flow pattern in penumbrae at this point .",
    "evershed flow channels are strongly magnetized at photospheric levels , values around 1.5 - 2.5  kg are typical . the tendency for enhanced horizontal magnetic field within flow channels by a few 100  g compared to",
    "the background is a robust feature .",
    "opposite polarity flux is present in the penumbra at a level of about @xmath214 of the total flux of the sunspot , with no resolution dependence for an otherwise fixed setup .",
    "the overall amount of opposite polarity flux increases with the extent of a penumbra from @xmath215 . 7 .",
    "integrated over the entire penumbra about @xmath3 of the downward directed mass flux is associated with magnetic flux having a polarity opposite to that of the umbra .",
    "we see only a moderate increase of this number with resolution and extent of the penumbra .",
    "thus , there should be a significant fraction of downflows in the penumbra with the same field polarity as the umbra , i.e. a substantial amount of mass flux returns by subduction of upward pointing magnetic field rather than by flowing along downward pointing field lines .",
    "while strong supersonic downflows are present in the outer penumbra ( we found up to 15  km@xmath34s@xmath7 flow amplitude ) , their overall contribution to the downward directed mass flux is with @xmath99 negligible .",
    "9 .   in the outer penumbra",
    "we find a substantial population of bright downflows that lead to a vanishing @xmath107 correlation , while the correlation in the inner penumbra and surrounding plage region are comparable ( reaching moderate values around @xmath216 ) .",
    "nevertheless , energy is transported in all these regions by convection .",
    "thus , low or moderate @xmath107 correlations can not be taken as an indication for the absence of convective energy transport , in particular when magnetic field is present in the photosphere . 10 .",
    "most of the vertical mass flux in the penumbra is balanced within each radial shell .",
    "the unbalanced component of the mass flux ( upflows in the inner and downflows in the outer penumbra ) is about @xmath217 of the total overturning mass flux integrated over the whole penumbra .",
    "we conclude this paper by summarizing the magnetic field and flow structure of penumbral filaments found in numerical simulations to date in figure [ fig : f21 ] .",
    "this sketch is mostly based on the conclusions from this paper as well as @xcite ( see figure 17 therein ) .",
    "the side view shows the central upflow regions of filaments where the average field and average flow are well aligned .",
    "the pressure driving in the upflows is almost orthogonal to the mostly horizontal acceleration of the evershed flow , requiring the lorentz force to facilitate the energy exchange ( the net work by the lorentz force is essentially zero ) . in the lateral downflow regions the magnetic field continues to point upward leading to a substantial misalignment between flow and field and submergence of field lines .",
    "the side view describes mostly the situation in the inner penumbra , where we do not find a substantial amount of inverse polarity magnetic flux .",
    "the top view shows the central upflow region with the adjacent lateral downflows . while mass is moving outward ( evershed flow )",
    "it moves to the edge of filaments where it returns beneath the solar surface mostly through submergence of field lines . only near the outer end of the filament a significant fraction of the mass flux returns through flows along downward pointing field lines .",
    "the cross section shows a structure with reduced magnetic field strength in the subphotospheric layers that is filled with an overturning convection pattern maintaining the penumbral brightness .",
    "while this structure has a lot of similarity with the idealized field free gap model of @xcite , it is not field free .",
    "the filament has a core with a substantial vertical field component ( see also figure 17 of @xcite ) that is spreading out laterally near the top of the filament .",
    "a fraction of it passes through the curved @xmath42 surface ( indicated by a dashed line ) and continues upward .",
    "overturning convection can bend some of these field lines back downward , leading to opposite polarity flux along the side of filaments .",
    "if the @xmath42 level is located deep enough , this can lead to the appearance of opposite polarity flux along the edge of filaments in magnetograms .",
    "the evershed flow ( shown in green ) increases rapidly toward the @xmath42 level in a region with a substantial vertical field component , leading to induction of a strong horizontal field component along the axis of the filament . overturning motions",
    "distribute the magnetic field along the @xmath42 level in a thin boundary layer shown in red , resulting in strongly magnetized evershed flow channels at photospheric levels that might appear like horizontal flux tubes to the observer .",
    "note that we simplified the picture in the sketch with regard to the distribution of the horizontal field component .",
    "horizontal field is present throughout most of the filament , it is however about a factor of @xmath50 stronger in the boundary layer indicated in the sketch and mostly there dynamically relevant ( the acceleration of the evershed flow takes place in this boundary layer , see indicated force balance ) .",
