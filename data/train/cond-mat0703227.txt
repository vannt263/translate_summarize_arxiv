    "the anisotropy in molecular shape plays a crucial role in the rich phase behavior that thermotropic liquid crystals exhibit @xcite .",
    "calamitic liquid crystals , that comprise rodlike molecules , are long known and their phase behavior and dynamics have been extensively investigated over decades @xcite . the discovery of discotic liquid crystals , that consist of disclike molecules , is , however , more recent and dates back only to the late 1970s @xcite . due to its unique structural , elctrical and optical properties , discotic liquid crystals have drawn considerable amount of interests in recent past @xcite . upon cooling from the high temperature isotropic ( i ) phase , discotic liquid crystals typically exhibit a nematic ( n ) phase and/or a columnar ( c ) phase @xcite .",
    "the discotic nematic phase is analogous to the nematic phase formed by rodlike molecules in that there is a long - range orientational order without the involvement of any long - range translational order . in the columnar phase that is typical of discotic liquid crystals ,",
    "the molecules are stacked on top of each other giving rise to a columnar structure .",
    "these columns form a long - range two dimensional order in the orthogonal plane with either a hexagonal or a rectangular symmetry .",
    "while the sequence of phases i - n - c has been observed experimentally with a number of discotic liquid crystals upon cooling , there have been only a few cases where i - c transition is observed @xcite .",
    "although these are highly interesting systems to study and computer simulation studies of model liquid crystals have undergone an upsurge in recent times @xcite , we are aware of only very few studies of orientational relaxation on discotic liquid crystals @xcite compared to that on rod - like molecules .",
    "discotic molecules typically contain an aromatic core with flexible chains added in the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "while atomistic models could in principle be undertaken , molecular models , where mesogens are approximated as particles with well - defined anisotropic shape , find their utility in obtaining a rather generalized view . a simple approach along this line involves consideration of purely repulsive models involving hard bodies",
    "this rather extreme choice is inspired by the idea that the equilibrium structure of a dense liquid is essentially determined by the repulsive forces which fix the molecular shape @xcite .",
    "along this line , thin hard platelets @xcite , hard oblate ellipsoids of revolution @xcite , and cut hard spheres @xcite have been investigated .",
    "such an approach is appealing for its simplicity @xcite .",
    "however , temperature plays no direct role in purely repulsive models on the contrary to what is desired for thermotropic liquid crystals @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the gay - berne pair potential @xcite , which is essentially a generalization of the lennard - jones potential to incorporate anisotropic interactions , or one of its variants @xcite , where mesogens are approximated with soft ellipsoids of revolution , appears to serve as a more realistic model .",
    "in fact , discotic liquid crystals , modeled by the gay - berne family of potentials , have been found to capture the key features of the experimentally observed phase behavior @xcite . in a density functional theoretical approach with a form of the gay - berne potential modified for discotic liquid crystals ,",
    "the isotropic - nematic - columnar phase behavior has recently been studied for various aspect ratios @xcite .",
    "dynamics of discotic liquid crystals have drawn attention as well @xcite .",
    "the focus has often been on the dynamics of the columnar phase @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have undertaken molecular dynamics simulations of a system of oblate ellipsoids of revolution interacting with a modified gay - berne pair potential to study temperature dependent orientational relaxation along two isobars .",
    "we have chosen two isobars such that the phase sequence i - n - c appears upon cooling along the one at a higher pressure and the sequence i - c along the other .",
    "we have investigated temperature dependent orientational relaxation across the isotropic - nematic transition and in the isotropic phase near the i - c phase boundary with a focus on the short - to - intermediate time decay behavior .",
    "this work follows up our recent work @xcite , which has reported the emergence of power law decay regime(s ) in orientational relaxation across the isotropic - nematic transition . in the spirit of the universal power law in orientational relaxation in thermotropic liquid crystals",
    "suggested therein @xcite , we compare the orientational dynamics we observed here with those of calamitic liquid crystals obtained from recent optical kerr effect measurements @xcite and molecular dynamics simulations studies @xcite .",
    "we further discuss the analogous dynamics observed in supercooled molecular liquids .",

    "the most intriguing feature has been the power law decay regimes at short - to - intermediate times @xcite .",
    "we have therefore monitored the time evolution of the collective second - rank otcf , defined by    @xmath53    in the present case , the negative of the time derivative of the collective second - rank otcf provides a measure of the experimentally observable ohd - oke signal . as monitoring the time evolution of @xmath54",
    "is computationally quite demanding , we have restricted ourselves to the short - to - intermediate time dynamics that would suffice to compare the most intriguing aspect of the experimental observations @xcite . in fig .",

    "is evident in the decay of the oke signal on either side of the i - n transition as illustrated by the linear fitting in fig .",
    "[ fig : oke](a ) . in consistency with the single - particle dynamics ,",
    "such a power law decay regime is _ not _ observed for the oke signal in the isotropic phase near the i - c phase boundary as apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : oke](b ) .",
    "it follows from the time evolution of the single - particle second - rank otcf shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : otcf2](a ) that as the system settles into the nematic phase , two power law decay regimes , that are separated by a plateau , emerge .",
    "such a feature bears a close resemblance with what has been observed recently for a model system of calamitic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "the decay pattern is also similar to those observed for models supercooled molecular liquids @xcite .",
    "in fact , based on a series of ohd - oke measurements fayers and coworkers have recently drawn an analogy in the orientational dynamics between calamitic liquid crystals in their isotropic phase near the i - n transition and supercooled molecular liquids @xcite .",
    "the analogous dynamics could be captured in a subsequent molecular dynamics simulation study of model systems of these two classes of soft condensed matter @xcite .",
    "the short - to - intermediate time power law decay of the oke signal observed therein bears a close similarity with what is found in the present discotic system across the i - n transition .",
    "the contrasting behavior observed in orientational relaxation in the isotropic phase near the i - n and the i - c phase boundaries is noteworthy .",
    "such an observation may throw new light on the origin of the power law relaxation in the isotropic phase near the i - n transition . while the i - c transition is strongly first order in nature ,",
    "the i - n transition is only weakly first order with certain characteristics of the continuous transition .",
    "this is reflected in the present case in a much larger change in the density marking the i - c transition as compared to the i - n transition ( data not shown ) .",
    "the weakly first order nature of the i - n transition appears to play a role in the short - to - intermediate time power law relaxation .",
    "it seems fair to trace the origin of the power law decay in orientational relaxation to the growth in the orientational correlation length in the isotropic phase near the i - n transition . to this end , we attempt a theoretical analysis in the next section .",
    "the i - n phase transition is weakly first order both in calamitic and discotic systems .",
    "this is manifested in the growing orientational pair correlation length as the i - n phase boundary is approached from the high temperature isotropic phase . apparently , a second order phase transition at a temperature only slightly lower ( by @xmath55 ) , where the orientational correlation length would have diverged , is preempted by the weakly first order phase transition .",
    "nevertheless , even this weakly first order phase transition is driven by the growing correlation length .",
    "the temperature dependent growth of this correlation length @xmath56 can be given by the following expression @xcite i @xmath57    where @xmath18 is @xmath58 in the landau mean - field theory .",
    "a simple mode coupling theory , based on time dependent density functional theory , shows that this growing correlation length can give rise to a power - law decay of the type observed in simulations .",
    "this approach uses the the generalized debye - stokes - einstein relation between the correlation time , diffusion , and friction @xcite @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 is equal to 1 for the single - particle relaxation , but is related to orientational caging for collective dynamics .",
    "it was shown elsewhere , the growing correlation length can give rise to a singular frequency dependence of @xmath62 over a frequency range @xmath63 with @xmath64 @xcite . this power law dependence in the frequency dependence of friction in turn",
    "gives rise to a power law decay in the orientational time correlation function along with the slowing down of the relaxation .",
    "thus , in the above mentioned theory , the origin of the power law decay is essentially the same as observed near the critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "however , one may not expect a universal behavior since there is no true divergence .",
    "the absence of power law decay near the i - c phase boundary could then be due to the absence of any growing correlation length .",
    "the i - c phase transition is strongly first order in nature where both orientational and positional order set in at the same time . since the growth of orientational correlation is small ,",
    "a power law decay is not expected .",
    "to this end , we have calculated the distance dependent orientational pair distribution function @xmath65 @xcite wihich is defined by    @xmath66    here , @xmath67 is a spherical hermonics and @xmath68 denotes the sperical polar angle made by the particle symmetry axis with the intermolecular separation vector .",
    "it can be shown that at sufficiently large separation at which orientations are uncorrelated , two spherical harmonics can be averaged independently of each other . when the director is taken to define @xmath69 axis of the laboratory frame",
    ", separate averaging gives    @xmath70    this coefficient will be vanished at large separations when ranks @xmath71 and @xmath72 are different . while for @xmath73 in the isotropic phase where order parameter vanishes and the coefficient @xmath65 tend to zero for large separatios",
    ", it will have a finite value if long range orientational correlation is devloped in the system . to verify our assertion made in theoretical section ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath74 for the systems studied here along both the isobars and presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gr](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : gr](b ) , respectively .",
    "while the growth of orientational correlation length is clearly evident across the i - n transition for large separations , such a growth is found to be totally absent in the isotropic phase near the i - c phase boundary .",
    "let us first summarize the main results of the present work . in order to understand orientational relaxation in disk - like molecules that form discotic phase on cooling ,",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of a model system that consists of oblate ellipsoids of revolution interacting with each other via a variant of the gay - berne pair potential .",
    "the system has been studied along two isobars so chosen that the phase sequence i - n - c appears upon cooling along the one and the sequence i - c along the other .",

    "study of orientational pair distribution function shows that there is a growth of orientational pair correlation near the i - n transition whereas such a growth is absent in the isotropic phase near the i - c phase boundary .",

    "dynamic quantity @xmath78 has no such straight foroward physical interpretation like @xmath76 .",
    "because of the slow power law decay , it has not been possible to calculate the relaxation times ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) near the i - n phase boundary .",
    "however , when calculated away from the phase boundary , when nrelaxation functions are nearly single exponential , the value of @xmath78 is found to be small .",
    "the dynamic quantity usually has small and negative value and also will not have much variation across the transitions as observed for several studies @xcite .",
