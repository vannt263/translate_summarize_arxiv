    "social choice theory , as a scientific discipline , started with the works of the eigthteenth - century french mathematician jean - charles de borda ( 1733 - 1799 ) who showed that majority rules could lead to inconsistent results when voters have to choose between three candidates .",
    "but it is only in 1951 when kenneth arrow published his celebrated impossibility theorem  @xcite , showing that there exists no social choice rule satisfying a set of reasonable requirements , that social choice became a scientific discipline .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe and study models of opinion formation under the influence of opinion leaders favoring the existence of polarized subgroups of individuals .",
    "although in a society each individual has personal opinions , these opinions could , to a certain extent , change under the influence of the opinions of the group of individuals this person is connected to , such as family members , friends , coworkers , and other persons who by virtue of position may exercise influence like politicians or journalists . since these individuals , influenced by other individuals , may also revise their own opinions , we observe successive modifications of each individual s opinions ; and one may reasonably ask if this iterative process leads to the formation of consensual subgroups of people .    in democratic societies , the outcome of political elections plays an essential role and it is not surprising to discover that the problem of voter decision - making as attracted many political scientists . in 1992 ,",
    "john zaller , in a book  @xcite , considered as a most important contribution to political science  @xcite , developed a theory to explain how people receive political information and determine their political preferences . following converse  @xcite",
    "zaller argues that most people do not have fixed positions on issues , only the most aware individuals , who are well informed , have a consistent ideology . in his own words `` there is high variance in political awareness around a generally low mean . ''",
    "public opinion is shaped by exposure to elite discourse , via the media , on issues with , however , significant differences in attention to this discourse .",
    "`` political awareness denotes intellectual or cognitive engagement with public affairs as against emotional or affective engagement or no engagement at all . ''",
    "the most aware individuals are more able to receive political information but , due to their exposure to multiple and often conflicting messages , are more selective in accepting ideas contradicting their basic values .",
    "the least aware individuals receive less information and are usually more likely to be influenced .",
    "thus , variations of political opinions and political awareness are strongly correlated . in our model ,",
    "described below , the dependence of an individual s awareness on her opinion plays an important role .",
    "the construction of a mathematical model of opinion dynamics implicitly assumes that opinions can be measured . in the 1920s it was controversial among psychologists whether attitudes could be measured . in 1928 , louis leon thurstone showed that it could be done  @xcite and even led to important results  @xcite .",
    "recently quite a few number of agent - based models of opinion formation have been studied  @xcite . in all these models as in ours ,",
    "each individual is represented by an agent whose state is a simplified description of the individual s characteristics .    in this paper",
    "we define and study different versions of a model of opinion formation .",
    "we represent a society of individuals by a directed graph , that is an ordered pair of disjoint sets @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a nonempty set of elements called vertices , nodes , or points , and @xmath2 a set of ordered pairs of distinct elements of @xmath1 , called directed edges , arcs , or links .",
    "each vertex is occupied by an individual whose state describes her name , the list of individuals she interacts with , her level of awareness , and her opinion .",
    "the opinion of an individual located at vertex @xmath3 evolves as a result of her interactions with the individuals located at all the vertices @xmath4 such that @xmath5 , according to an evolution rule that takes into account opinions and levels of awareness of the interacting individuals .",
    "all the individuals directly connected to a given individual @xmath3 form her _ social environment _ or _",
    "social neighborhood_. in what follows , the words _ neighbor _ and _ neighborhood _ will not imply any spatial proximity ; a neighbor of @xmath3 is just an element of her social environment who may influence her opinion .",
    "our model of opinion formation in a population of individuals is a scale - free social network in which each vertex is occupied by an individual .",
    "social networks , such as scientific collaboration networks  @xcite , coauthorship networks of scientific papers  @xcite , human sexual contacts networks  @xcite , e - mail addresses networks  @xcite , are characterized by a small average shortest path length between two randomly selected vertices , a high clustering coefficient and , in most cases , a power - law probability distribution for the vertices degrees .",
    "@xcite .",
    "each individual s level of awareness is represented by a real number @xmath6 between 0 and 1 . in our model , the opinion of an individual with a high @xmath6-value are thought to have more value ; she has a strong convincing power when interacting with other individuals and a high degree of `` wise '' skepticism when influenced by other individuals .",
    "concepts similar to our level of awareness have been introduced by various authors .",
    "french  @xcite defines the _ power _ of a over b ( with respect to a given opinion ) as the maximum force which a can induce on b minus the maximum resisting force which b can mobilize in the opposite directions ; de groot  @xcite , krause  @xcite , and hegselmann and krause  @xcite define a stochastic matrix of positive coefficients @xmath7 representing the _ weight given by @xmath3 to @xmath8 _ that may change with time and opinions ; nowak _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in the numerical study of a model inspired by latan s theory of social impact  @xcite , among other attributes , characterize each individual by a strength variable called _",
    "persuasiveness_. in our model , the level of awareness of an individual is a time - independent characteristic of the individual .    for the probability distribution of levels of awareness in the society we have chosen a bell - shaped probability density function @xmath9 symmetric about @xmath10 given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 choosing @xmath13 makes the percentages of the population belonging to the four groups of individuals having , respectively , a level of awareness in the semi - open intervals @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 approximately equal to 10 % , 40 % , 40 % , and 10 % ( exactly 10.07 , 39.93 , 39.93 , and 10.07 ) . the graph of @xmath9 is represented in figure  [ fig : awarenesspdf ] .",
    "_ probability density function of the distribution of levels of awareness in the population .",
    "the vertical lines delimit four different groups of individuals ( see text ) . _ ]    each individual has an opinion represented by a real number in the interval @xmath180,1[$ ] uniformly distributed among all individuals .",
    "an individual s opinion may change at each time step according to three different probabilistic evolution rules :    * _ 1- adopt leader s opinion . _",
    "the individual @xmath3 with a level of awareness equal to @xmath19 changes her opinion @xmath20 with the probability @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a positive real which is the same for all individuals , to adopt the opinion of the individual in her neighborhood who has the highest level of awareness if this level of awareness is higher than her own . * _",
    "2- adopt weighted average opinion . _",
    "the individual @xmath3 with a level of awareness equal to @xmath19 changes her opinion @xmath20 with the probability @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a positive real which is the same for all individuals , to adopt the weighted average opinion of her neighbors @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the level of awareness of neighbor @xmath26 and @xmath27 her opinion ,",
    "the sum being extended to all vertices @xmath26 such that @xmath28 is a directed link . *",
    "_ 3- adopt weighted average of neighbors opinions having a higher level of awareness _ same as above except that an individual @xmath3 with a level of awareness equal to @xmath19 changes her opinion @xmath20 with the probability @xmath21 to adopt the weighted average opinion of the subgroup of neighbors having a higher level of awareness than her own .",
    "this last rule is a sort of compromise between the two previous ones .",
    "we also considered slightly different versions of the evolution rules just described in which the probabilistic condition is replaced by a threshold condition .",
    "that is , an individual @xmath3 , instead of adopting a new opinion with a probability equal to @xmath29 , adopts a new opinion if , and only if , the new opinion does not differ from her own by more that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , as mentioned above , is the same positive real for all individuals .",
    "note that for both probabilistic and threshold conditions , the exponent @xmath22 characterizes the level of skepticism of the society as a whole .",
    "increasing its value increases the level of skepticism of the whole population and makes it more difficult to convince .",
    "the exponent @xmath22 can therefore be viewed as a cultural trait of the society . in our numerical simulations we took @xmath30 .",
    "note also that the expressions of both versions of the evolution rules show that individuals with a low level of awareness are much easier to convince than individuals with a high level of awareness .",
    "the least aware individuals , that is , in our model , the individuals with a small level of awareness are responsible of the observed fickleness of voters in polls during election campaigns",
    ".    to sum up , in our models , a social network model is represented by a directed graph with @xmath31 nodes .",
    "each node is occupied by an individual characterized by    * her _ name _ : an integer between @xmath32 and @xmath31 ; * her _ social environment _ : a list of the individuals ( called neighbors ) she interacts with ; * her _ level of awareness @xmath6 _ : a real in the semi - open interval @xmath33 ; * her _ opinion @xmath34 _ : a real in the open interval @xmath180,1[$ ] .",
    "the size of each neighborhood is a random integer uniformly distributed between @xmath32 and a maximum value @xmath35 ( implying an average number of neighbors equal to 4 ) .",
    "an individual @xmath26 belongs to the neighborhood of individual @xmath36 if the directed link @xmath28 belongs to the set @xmath2 of graph s edges .",
    "while vertices out - degrees are uniformly distributed between @xmath32 and @xmath37 , the random selection of neighbors is such that vertices in - degrees have a pareto probability distribution with a minimum value parameter @xmath38 and a shape parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the probability distribution of in - degrees has , therefore , a cumulative distribution function given by @xmath40 , and a density function equal to @xmath41 . and",
    "a shape parameter equal to @xmath42 is @xmath43 ]    to complete the definition of the model , we define a subgroup of individuals called _",
    "opinion leaders_. this subgroup consists of the @xmath44 individuals located at the nodes having the highest in - degrees , that is , the individuals who belong to more neighborhoods .",
    "more precisely , each individual of the fraction @xmath45 of the total number @xmath31 of individuals , selected among those having the highest in - degrees , is assigned a level of awareness @xmath46 and , with a probability @xmath47 , an opinion either equal to @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "this subnetwork of opinion leaders is , therefore , the group of the most influential individuals . since their level of awareness is equal to 1 , they never change opinion during the temporal evolution of the system .",
    "they represent a group of commmitted individuals firmly attached to their opinion .",
    "for example , in a population of 1000 individuals , with @xmath50 , the states of individuals 587 and 723 could be given by @xmath51 individual 587 has 4 neighbors  individuals 426 , 802 , 977 , and 679 , a level of awareness @xmath52 , and an opinion @xmath53 , whereas individual 723 is an opinion leader who has 7 neighbors  individuals 770 , 91 , 367 , 313 , 967 , 349 , and 68 , a level of awareness @xmath54 , and an opinion @xmath55 .    at each time step , for all integers @xmath56 , the opinion @xmath20 of individual @xmath3 evolves according to one of the six evolution rules mentioned above . in a more general model",
    "we could consider that each individual has various opinions on different issues and apply similar evolution rules to each opinion .",
    "we performed several runs of the six different evolution rules applied to 20 different initial societies of 1000 individuals having a fraction @xmath57 of committed individuals with a level of awareness equal to 1 .",
    "these individuals have , with a probability @xmath47 , an opinion either equal to @xmath58 or to @xmath59 . the levels of awareness of the remaining part of the population",
    "are randomly distributed following the probability density function @xmath9 given by  ( [ eqn : pdf ] ) . according to whether her level of awareness belongs to one of the following semi - open intervals : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath16 , or @xmath17 , we say that the individual belongs to group 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 .",
    "following zaller , chosing @xmath30 implies that individuals in group 1 have a particularly low level of awareness and are , therefore , very easy to convince , whereas individuals in group 4 have a high level of awareness and are especially difficult to convince .",
    "groups 2 and 3 represent the majority ; they have a moderate level of awareness and are more or less easy to convince according to whether they belong to group 2 or 3 .",
    "the average distribution of opinions in the 20 initial societies is represented in figure  [ fig : initialhistogram ] and the percentages of individuals belonging to the different groups are given in table  [ initialnumbers ] . in order to compare the different evolution rules , all the reported numerical results were obtained starting from the same 20 initial populations of 1000 individuals .    _ histogram of the distribution of opinions averaged over the 20 initial societies . _ ]    .__percentages of the total population belonging to each group ; groups 0.4 and 0.6 denote the groups of strongly committed individuals having a level of awareness equal to 1 and an opinion either equal to 0.4 or 0.6 . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the evolution of the distribution of opinions according to rules 5 and 6 are very similar ( compare results given in tables  [ percentagesr5unconvinced ] and [ percentagesr6unconvinced ] ) . actually",
    ", the individuals changing opinions belong essentially to groups 1 and 2 , and these individuals evolve exactly in the same manner for both rules 5 and 6 .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the distribution of opinions of 20 different 1000-individual societies in which each individual , located at a vertex of a directed graph , is characterized by her name ( an integer in the range @xmath62 $ ] ) , the list of people she is interacting with , her level of awareness ( a real @xmath6 between 0 and 1 ) , and her opinion ( a real @xmath34 between 0 and 1 ) . the out - degree of a vertex , representing the number of persons who may influence the opinion of the individual located at that vertex , is a random number uniformly distributed between 1 and @xmath37 .",
    "the in - degree of a vertex , representing the number of persons who may be influenced by the opinion of the individual located at that vertex , is a random number pareto distributed with a minimum value parameter @xmath38 and a shape parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting power - law behavior of the in - degrees implies that there exist individuals who may influence a large number of other individuals .",
    "the group @xmath63 individuals having the highest in - degrees , is assigned a level of awareness @xmath46 and , with a probability @xmath47 , an opinion either equal to @xmath50 or @xmath59 .",
    "this subnetwork of the most influential individuals are opinion leaders who never change opinion during temporal evolutions of the system .",
    "the evolution rules are of three different types .",
    "an individual can either adopt the opinion of the individual , among those she is connected to , who has the highest level of awareness if this level of awareness is higher than her own or adopt the weighted average of the opinions of all the individuals she is connected to or adopt the weighted average of the opinions of the individuals having a higher level of awareness than her own among those she is connected to .",
    "each of these rules has two versions .",
    "an individual with a level of awareness @xmath6 may either adopt a new opinion with a probability equal to @xmath64 or adopt a new opinion if this opinion differs from her own by less than @xmath64 .",
    "the choice of the power @xmath65 makes individuals with a level of awareness less than @xmath66 very easy to convince and individuals with a level of awareness greater than @xmath67 extremely reluctant to adopt a new opinion .",
    "all numerical simulations have shown that the temporal evolution according to rule 1 ( which consists , for a person with level of awareness @xmath6 , to adopt , with a probability @xmath64 , the opinion of the individual having the highest level of awareness among those she is connected to when the leader s level of awareness is higher than her own ) leads very quickly to the formation of two important , roughly equivalent , polarized consensual subgroups of individuals having either the opinion 0.4 or the opinion 0.6 , whereas the temporal evolution according to rule 5 ( which consists , for a person with level of awareness @xmath6 and an opinion @xmath34 , to adopt the weighted average opinion @xmath68 of the individuals she is connected to if the condition @xmath69 is verified ) leads rather slowly to a much less polarized society with the formation of a group of individuals having a bell - shaped distribution of opinions centered at @xmath10 accompanied by less pronounced peaks corresponding to the two groups of opinion leaders .",
    "the formation of polarized consensual subgroups seems therefore to reveal that people are essentially influenced by opinion leaders ( elite discourse ) conveyed through the media by , for example , politicians and journalists , whereas the formation of a group with opinions distributed around a median opinion appears to be the result of interactions with closely related individuals such as family members , friends and coworkers .",
