    "studies of binary and multiple clusters are interesting from the point of view of star formation and evolution in galaxies .",
    "a possible mechanism of formation of double stellar systems had been suggested by fujimoto & kumai @xcite , and further developed by bekki et al .",
    "@xcite , where cloud - cloud collisions were considered as the most feasible way to produce two or more clusters .",
    "a different scenario was proposed by leon et al .",
    "@xcite considering a tidal capture .",
    "these theories were introduced after the detection of binary clusters in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) in bhatia & hatzidimitriou @xcite , hatzidimitriou & bhatia @xcite , and references therein .",
    "a significant fraction , of open clusters in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) were found in pairs , with the maximum projected separation between the centers of the components 18.7  pc .",
    "the number of found pairs was greater than expected from projection effects .",
    "it was also suggested that some of the binary cluster candidates were physical pairs .",
    "a catalogue with a photographic atlas of the binary system candidates in the lmc was compiled by bhatia et al .",
    "some of these objects possibly were triple systems and some of the binary cluster candidates were imbedded in molecular clouds .",
    "hatzidimitriou & bhatia @xcite catalogued the cluster pairs in the smc .",
    "dieball et al .",
    "@xcite further developed this research and presented a new catalogue of binary and multiple cluster candidates in the lmc .    in our galaxy @xmath0 and @xmath1 persei ( ngc  869 and ngc  884 ) had been for a long time the only distinguishable binary open cluster , until subramanyam et al . (",
    "1995 ) detected 18 probable binary systems with spatial separations between the components of up to 20  pc .",
    "out of these , 16 pairs had members that seemed to have similar ages , which might suggest that they were physical pairs .",
    "this suggestion was based on the ages and radial velocities of the member clusters .",
    "these studies revealed that the fraction of clusters in pairs in the galaxy was significantly smaller than that in the mc : 9% from the 400 clusters investigated by subramaniam et al .",

    "( 2002 ) .",
    "all pairs in the above studies were visually separable .",
    "however , it is possible that some cluster pairs overlap in the line of sight and it is difficult or impossible to resolve them .",
    "thus they are seen as single clusters .",
    "some of them might be physical pairs , some not .",

    "we propose that this feature of magnitude distributions could indicate duality or multiplicity of the open cluster systems overlapping in the line of sight .",
    "there are 938 open clusters in the webda database with available rectangular positions ( hpd type ) of the member stars . among them",
    "we choose 563 rich clusters with more than 100 members to examine the distributions of v - magnitude of stars in each cluster . limiting magnitudes of stars varied for different clusters from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "most of the v - magnitude distributions showed a typical gaussian - like form with a single peak . however the v - magnitude distributions of about 70 clusters displayed two and more `` humps '' .",
    "[ samples ] illustrates two examples of these distributions .",
    "the first one - alessi  13 - has a single magnitude peak , which is typical for 88% of the chosen rich clusters .",
    "the second one - ngc  2384 - exhibits two distinct peaks .",
    "we propose that one of the explanations for this kind of profile can be two clusters overlapping due to projection effect .",
    "if this is the case , then they might be either close physical systems or separate clusters projected along the same line of sight . since the probability of the latter is less than 1 ( subramanyam et al .",
    "% @xcite ) , it is likely that most of them are physically associated .",
    "binary open clusters projected on the sky can be seen with separated members like h and @xmath0 persei , but some of them should overlap , one being behind another , so that the components can not be resolved ( fig .",
    "[ project ] within the volume abcd ) . assuming the maximum distance between the centres of the two clusters to be 20  pc and equal sizes of the constituents , we estimated the probability that an arbitrary pair is seen as an overlapping cluster :    @xmath5    this probability depends on the sizes of the components and is plotted in fig .  [ probability ] .",
    "according to this plot , for example , about 70% of the binary clusters , each of the members of which have diameters about 3  pc should be seen to an observer as overlapped and thus as a single cluster , and all the clusters with diameters @xmath6  pc should overlap .",

    "the profile similar to that of ngc  2384 with two ( or more ) peaks can be best adjusted by the combination of two ( or more ) evd functions :    @xmath7    @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of components , @xmath10 is a centre of evd for i - th component , @xmath11 is the fitted coefficient , and @xmath12 the standard deviation .",
    "two evd functions with different centres and their superposition are shown in fig .",
    "[ ev1ev2 ] .",
    "all 70 clusters with two and more `` humps '' in their v - magnitude distributions were processed and fitted by the combination of evd functions ( eq . [ evd ] ) .",
    "the goodness of fits were in the range of 0.8 to 0.98 .",
    "these clusters were compiled into a catalogue presented in tables 1 and 2 . with our criteria , we found 56 binary , 12 triple and 2 quadruple overlapping cluster candidates .",
    "the number of stars in the i - th cluster member was determined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the evd function for the i - th cluster , @xmath15 runs the bin numbers of the i - th cluster .",
    "discrepancies between the total number of stars @xmath16 and the sum of the calculated numbers of stars in the members were @xmath17 which characterize the uncertainty of belonging of some stars to either components .",
    "geometrical centres of the clusters and those of the i - th companion were determined as @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the probability for a star with magnitude @xmath21 to belong to the i - th component :    @xmath22",
    "the differences in magnitude peaks @xmath23 range from 1.5 to 8 , the majority of them falling between 1.5 and 3 ( see fig .",
    "[ deltam ] ) .",
    "differences in intensities between the two structures are    @xmath24    for @xmath25 , as in the case of ngc  2384 in fig .",

    "if we assume that there is an absorption cloud between the two structures , then their separation will be considerably smaller .",
    "young clusters are located in large molecular clouds ( efremov @xcite ) .",
    "some binary cluster candidates in the catalogue of bhatia et al .",
    "@xcite were imbedded in clouds . in this case",
    "@xmath23 could be due to the inter - cluster cloud absorption .",
    "when a cluster formation starts in two parts of a giant molecular cloud , a light pressure from young stars drives out the rest of the cloud .",
    "these fragments could be kept by the gravity of the clusters and concentrate in the libration zones , thus forming the dense absorptive clouds , which could be responsible for @xmath23 .",
    "though in some cases , if there is another cluster nearby , the second peak can appear due to stars of this cluster .",
    "this might be true for the magnitude distribution of ngc  2384 , shown on the fig .",
    "[ samples ] , which has a nearby cluster ngc  2383 .",
    "as was stated in piskunov et al .",
    "@xcite , the central part of ngc  2384 might be relatively free from contamination from ngc  2383 , it is possible that the farer parts of it might not .        various configurations of projections of clusters and inter - cluster clouds ( fig .",
    "[ configuration ] ) result in different magnitude profiles . in the case of the configuration",
    "when one companion is behind another separated by a molecular cloud ( on the left diagram in fig .  [ configuration ] )",
    ", an observer sees a single cluster instead of two , but the magnitude distribution shows two peaks . in the case of the configuration on the right in fig .",
    "[ configuration ] one sees a visually separable double cluster .",
    "we encountered two cases of the double - peak magnitude distributions : when the first peak is higher than the second , and vice versa . if the second peak is higher than the first ( the case of coma berenices cluster , fig .  [ tri_cluster1 ] )",
    ", it can indicate that either ( a ) the rare cluster is more populous than the front one , or ( b ) there are two or more clusters in the rare ( right picture on fig .  [ tri_cluster1 ] ) , or ( c ) the tail of the rare cluster is `` contaminated '' by a large number of background stars , and therefore it looks richer ( fig .  [ two_background ] ) .",
    "we would like to point out the case of ngc  6633 . fig .",
    "[ clus_back ] shows how the combination of `` cluster + background stars '' can result in the magnitude distribution like that of ngc  6633 ( fig .",
    "[ ngc6633_2 ] ) . for the real distribution we used two different fittings shown in fig .",
    "[ ngc6633_2 ] : one with the `` cluster + background stars '' combination ( left diagram ) , and the usual combination of two evds ( right diagram ) . in both cases the goodness of fits were high , though it seems that the second peak is due to the background stars .",
    "selection effects and incompleteness of data also can affect magnitude distributions . to determine the probable cause of the double peak in a magnitude histogram - either duality , or neighbouring cluster , or background / foreground stars , each case",
    "must be studied individually .",
    "the differences of magnitude centres of the clusters from our list vary from @xmath27 to 8 .",
    "[ deltam ] demonstrates the distribution of this value , where @xmath28 is dominant .     in overlapping binary open cluster candidates.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ age ] the distribution of ages of overlapping double and multiple open clusters in our list are presented , demonstrating that clusters of all ages are presented almost evenly , about 50% being young objects .",
    "studying probable duality or multiplicity of open clusters we considered only v - magnitude distributions for consistency and the maximum data completeness , since the v - band data were available for all objects .",
    "however many clusters in our list have measurements in other filters too .",
    "we consider here one particular case with measurements in b - band , usually available for brighter stars .",
    "we present an example of coma berenices ( or mellote 111 ) cluster as a typical case of an overlapping double open cluster candidate in more detail .",
    "the distance to the object is 96  pc - this is the second closest cluster in our list .",
    "it is a young cluster ( @xmath29 ) and 459 stars are listed in the webda database .",
    "the v - magnitude distribution of coma berenices cluster with its evd fit is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ coma_ber ] ( left diagram ) .",
    "the peaks appear at @xmath30 and 12.5 .",
    "the difference between the magnitudes @xmath31 is typical for most of the members of our list .",
    "the goodness of fit is 0.87 . to exclude background stars we used the accumulation method for determination of cluster membership by javakhishvili et al .",
    "@xcite , selecting the stars with close proper motions .",
    "thus the number of cluster members ( having both proper motions and @xmath32 ) , with probability more than 90% , were 198 .",
    "the corresponding v - magnitude distribution ( fig .",
    "[ coma_ber ] , right diagram ) also reveals dual feature of the cluster around almost the same magnitude peaks @xmath33 and 12.7 .",
    "this indicates that stars around these peaks have similar proper motions , thus they possibly are physically associated .            in fig  [ coma_ber_cmd_all ]",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of the cluster are presented , for all stars ( right diagram ) and cluster members after membership determination ( left diagram ) .",
    "double feature also can be seen in these cmds and around the same v - magnitudes @xmath34 and 13 , which can be one more argument in favour of duality of coma ber open cluster , the components of which are visually overlapped .",
    "in addition to the visually separable binary open cluster candidates in the galaxy found by subramaniam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , there might be pairs that overlap in the line of sight and are seen as single clusters . on the basis of the webda database we investigated open clusters in the galaxy considering the distributions of the v - magnitudes of cluster members .",
    "those clusters that demonstrated two or more magnitude peaks were regarded as candidates for overlapping binary and multiple systems .",
    "we found that these distributions can be well fitted by combinations of two or more extreme value distribution functions .",
    "we examined the v - magnitude distributions of 563 clusters from the webda for which more than 100 members are listed and revealed that 70 of them have more than one peaks and considered them as binary and multiple cluster candidates . on the basis of these assumptions we compiled a catalogue of the overlapping binary and multiple cluster candidates of the galaxy .",
