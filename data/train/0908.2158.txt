    "detecting cp violating phases in the lepton sector is one of the most challenging problems in the study of neutrino mixing . in the basis of diagonal charged lepton mass matrix ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath2 can be written in flavor basis as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pmns mixing matrix , which can be written as @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 are the majorana phases and the mixing matrix @xmath7 can be parameterized by one dirac phase and three angles : solar angle @xmath8 , atmospheric angle @xmath9 , and chooz angle @xmath10 .",
    "the measurement of the effective electron - neutrino mass in the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath11 ) experiments can not restrict the two majorana cp violating phases present in the pmns mixing matrix .",
    "the effective electron - neutrino mass @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 this effective mass parameter depends on the angles @xmath8 and @xmath10 , the neutrino masses @xmath14 , dirac cp phase , and majorana phases @xmath6 .",
    "there are several studies on using the results of ( @xmath11 ) together with the new data from terrestrial and astrophysical observation in order to restrict the majorana neutrino cp violating phases@xcite .",
    "however , this analysis is model dependent and quite sensitive to the ansatz of the neutrino mass spectrum : quasi - degenerate , normal or inverted hierarchies . in this respect",
    ", it is not possible to measure the majorana neutrino cp phases from ( @xmath11 ) experiment .",
    "this may be expected since in the ( @xmath11 ) one measures the lifetime of the decay of two neutrons in a nucleus into two protons and two electrons , which is a cp conserving quantity .",
    "on the other hand , direct bounds on other effective neutrino mass parameters @xmath15 from present experimental data are very poor .",
    "currently , the strongest bound for the muon - neutrino case from the @xmath16 branching fraction @xcite is only @xmath17 tev @xcite , which leads * to a * negligible constraint on the neutrino masses and cp violating phases .",
    "therefore , it is commonly believed that direct bounds from other @xmath18 decays are only of academic interest and can not fix the neutrino mixing parameters @xcite .",
    "some attempts to detect cp violation based on the difference between oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos can be found in ref.@xcite .    here",
    "we propose a mechanism , based on neutrino - antineutrino oscillation @xcite , which would allow to derive a strong bound on the effective mass of the muon - neutrino .",
    "in addition , it provides a method for detecting the majorana neutrino cp violating phases through measuring the cp asymmetry of the @xmath0 decay where neutrino - antineutrino oscillation take place . using the bound on the neutrino - antineutrino oscillation probability reported by the minos collaboration @xcite",
    ", we derive a bound on @xmath19 which improves existing bounds by several orders of magnitude .",
    "it is worth noting that the probability of a process associated to neutrino oscillation is usually assumed to be factorized into three independent parts : the production process , the oscillation probability and the detection cross section . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approximation was avoided and a generic framework based on quantum field theory was proposed to get a simple expression for the cp asymmetry . here , we adopt the s - matrix amplitude method described in @xcite .",
    "let us start by considering a positive charged pion which decays into a virtual neutrino at the space - time location @xmath20 together with a positive charged muon .",
    "after propagating , the neutrino can be converted into an antineutrino which produces a positive charged muon at the point @xmath21 when it interacts with a target , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . for definiteness",
    ", we illustrate this process with the production of the neutrino in @xmath22 decay and its later detection via its weak interaction with a target nucleon @xmath23 @xmath24 where the superscript @xmath25 refers to the virtual neutrino ( antineutrino ) at the source ( detection ) vertex .",
    "this @xmath26 process is a clear signal for neutrino - antineutrino oscillations of the muon type and its amplitude should be proportionnal to neutrino majorana masses .",
    "if one ignores other flavors , the time evolution of the @xmath27 system would be analogous to that of the @xmath28 or @xmath29 systems .",
    "followed by the detection process:@xmath30.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    instead , we prefer to use the formalism developed in ref.@xcite , where the whole reaction includes the production and detection processes of neutrinos .",
    "the decay amplitude becomes ( for simplicity we assume that leptonic flavor is conserved at the production and detection vertices ) : @xmath31 where the relation @xmath32 between flavor @xmath33 and mass @xmath34 neutrino eigenstates has been used , @xmath35 mev is the @xmath0 decay constant , and @xmath36 parametrizes the interaction with the nucleon .",
    "note that , contrary to the case of neutrino oscillations @xcite , only the neutrino mass term survives in this case . for simplicity , one assumes that @xmath37 where we use @xmath38 and @xmath39   @xcite .",
    "if we neglect terms of @xmath40 , one obtains @xmath41p_{l}\\cdot p_{2}\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\!\\left .",
    "\\!2m_{n}f(g_{a})\\left[e_{2 } -e_{l}\\left(1+\\frac{m_{\\pi}^{2}}{m_{\\mu}^{2}}\\right)\\right]\\right .",

    "the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 are given by : @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "one can easily check that eq .",
    "( [ tsquare ] ) is not factorizable into ( production)@xmath48(propagation)@xmath48(detection ) subprocesses due to the terms proportional to @xmath49 , where @xmath34 is the angle between the directions of @xmath50 particles .",
    "this is an important difference with respect to the case of neutrino - neutrino ( @xmath51 ) oscillations where it was shown in ref.@xcite that the s - matrix formalism reproduces the hypothesis of factorization of the probabilities .",

    "limit which corresponds to a long - baseline neutrino experiment , the oscillation terms can not be neglected and this process depends on a new combination of phases , mixing angles and masses which could give us complementary information on the neutrinoless double beta decays or on any process that depends exclusively on the effective majorana mass of the neutrinos . using this expression for the rate it is possible to get the cp asymmetry which will depend explicitly on majorana phases .",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "here @xmath68 is the difference in the squares of second and third eigenstate neutrino masses , @xmath69 ev@xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the distance between production and detection vertices .",
    "finally , @xmath72 is the energy of the neutrino beam .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the time evolution amplitude for the cp - conjugate process corresponds to the observation of @xmath73 at the source and at the detector .",
    "therefore , the associated nucleon weak vertex is given by @xmath74 . in  estimating the cp asymmetry in eq.([acp ] ) , we have assumed that @xmath75 .    in the limit of @xmath76 , the majorana phases @xmath77 are the only sources of cp violation and hence @xmath78 . for @xmath79 and @xmath80 one finds@xmath81 \\sin \\gamma.\\ ] ] thus , in the case of long - baseline neutrino experiment like minos where the distance @xmath71 is given by @xmath82 km and the energy @xmath72 is typically around @xmath83 gev @xcite , one finds that @xmath84 .",
    "thus , measuring cp asymmetry will be unavoidable indication for large cp violating majorana phases .",
    "the last two decades have witnessed several experiments that investigate the neutrino - antineutrino transitions .",
    "it started in 1982 when the bebc bubble chamber in the cern sps neutrino beam set a limit on @xmath85 and @xmath86 through the search for @xmath87 appearance .",
    "recently , minos @xcite has measured the spectrum of @xmath88 events which are missing after travelling @xmath89 km .",
    "it is these missing events which are the potential source of @xmath90 appearance . in their preliminary analysis",
    ", they were able to put a limit on the fraction of muon neutrinos transition to muon anti - neutrinos @xcite : @xmath91    assuming cpt , this limit can be written as @xmath92 using our expression for @xmath93 , and the corresponding rate for neutrino oscillations @xcite , one gets @xmath94 in the limit of ultrarelativistic neutrinos , @xmath95 . and keeping the leading terms in the @xmath96 terms , we get @xmath97 to illustrate the usefulness of this relation , let us assume the case of two flavor neutrinos . in this case , one finds @xmath98    from this equation , it is possible to get a bound on the effective muon - neutrino majorana mass , only depending on the values of the majorana phases as the oscillation terms can not be neglected . if @xmath99 and using @xmath100 gev , one gets the following conservative bound on @xmath101 if @xmath102 , the conservative bound on @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 if @xmath105 , it is not possible to get a conservative bound on @xmath103 but the equation ( [ majorana ] ) could be used to bound majorana parameters ( masses and phases ) which appear in @xmath103 .",
    "so , within the hypothesis done on majorana phases , the limits obtained improve by various order of magnitude the actual limit on @xmath106 coming from direct search in @xmath107 decay .",
    "also , one could expect improvement in experimental analysis in the next years and we could expect that with a specially designed neutrino experiment to measure these kind of processes , it should be possible to improve these limits by a few orders of magnitude in future experiments .    in minos and in general in all long - baseline neutrino experiments ,",
    "the oscillation terms are not negligible .",
    "so , it means that such analysis could not only give us information on the neutrino effective majorana mass but it could be used to determine parameters of the mixing matrices and bound on the absolute value of majorana masses .",
    "also , if in a long - baseline neutrino experiment , neutrino detectors are located at different distances from the source , it should be possible to get enough constraints on the mixing parameters and majorana masses to fix them .",
    "if majorana neutrinos do exist , @xmath26 processes like neutrino - antineutrino oscillations can occur .",
    "the production of leptons with same charges at the production and detection vertices of neutrinos will be a clear manifestation of these processes . in this paper",
    "we have used the s - matrix formalism of quantum field theory to describe these oscillations in the case of muon neutrinos produced in @xmath22 decays which convert into muon antineutrinos that are detected via inverse beta decay on nucleons .",
    "one interesting result is that the time evolution probability of the whole process is not factorizable into production , oscillation and detection probabilities , as is the case in neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "we find that , for very short times of propagation of neutrinos , the observation of @xmath108 events would lead to a direct bound on the effective mass of muon majorana neutrinos . in the case of long - baseline neutrino experiments , the cp rate asymmetry for production of @xmath109 events would lead to direct bounds on the difference of cp - violating majorana phases . finally , using the current bound on muon neutrino - antineutrino oscillations reported by the minos collaboration we are able to set the bound @xmath110 mev , which is several orders of magnitude below current bounds reported in the literature .    as a consequence of these results ,",
    "neutrino experiments aiming to measure neutrino - antineutrino oscillations with different short- and long - baseline setups can be useful to get direct and complementary constraints on the masses and phases of majorana neutrinos .",
