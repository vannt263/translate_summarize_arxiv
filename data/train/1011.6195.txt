    "the problem of enumerating _ self - avoiding walks _ ( saws ) and _ polygons _ ( saps ) on a lattice is a famous one , whose complete solution has thus far remained most elusive .",
    "for the square lattice , it is conjectured that the number @xmath5 of walks of _ length _  @xmath3 and the number @xmath6 of polygons of _ perimeter _",
    "@xmath3 each satisfy an asymptotic formula of the general form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "( in the case of polygons , it is understood that  @xmath3 must be restricted to even values . )",
    "the number  @xmath10 is the `` growth constant '' and the number  @xmath11 is often referred to as the `` critical exponent '' .",
    "more precisely , the following expansions are conjectured , @xmath12 for some @xmath13 .    for the square lattice ,",
    "numerical methods based on acceleration of convergence and differential approximants suggest the value @xmath14 this estimate is indistinguishable from the solution of the biquadratic equation @xmath15 , which we consider to be a useful mnemonic .",
    "this was observed by conway , enting and guttmann @xcite in 1993 , and verified to 11 significant digits by jensen and guttmann @xcite in 2000 , based on extensive numerical analysis of the sequence @xmath16 up to @xmath17 .",
    "( remarkably enough , for the honeycomb lattice , it had long been conjectured that the growth constant of walks is the biquadratic number @xmath18 , a fact rigorously established only recently by duminil - copin and smirnov  @xcite . )    as regards critical exponents , the conjectured value @xmath19 for walks is supported by results of lawler , schramm , and werner that relate the self - avoiding walk to the `` stochastic loewner evolution '' ( sle ) process of index @xmath20 ; see , for instance , the account in werner s inspiring lecture notes  @xcite . for ( unrooted ) polygons , the value @xmath21 was suggested by numerical analysis of the exact counting sequence , with an agreement to the seventh decimal place  @xcite .",
    "it is also supported by the observation that many simplified , exactly solvable , ( naturally rooted ) models of self - avoiding polygons appear to exhibit an @xmath22 universal behaviour  for these aspects , we refer to the survey by bousquet - mlou and brak  @xcite , as well as the books  @xcite .    regarding lattice polygons , which are closed walks , there is also interest in enumeration according to _ area _ , rather than perimeter .",
    "this question has analogies with the classical unsolved problem of enumerating polyominoes , also known as animals ( these may have `` holes '' ) , according to the number of cells they contain .",
    "conjecturally  @xcite , the number @xmath23 ( respectively , @xmath24 ) of polygons ( respectively , polyominoes ) comprised of  @xmath3 cells satisfy asymptotic estimates of the form @xmath25 for some @xmath26 ; these asymptotic estimates are still of the form  , with the critical exponent @xmath27 .",
    "interestingly enough , the critical exponent  @xmath28 , corresponding to a simple pole of the associated generating function , is otherwise known to arise in several simplified models , such as column - convex , convex , and directed polyominoes  @xcite .    as the foregoing discussion suggests ,",
    "there is considerable interest in solving , exactly , probabilistically , or asymptotically , restricted models of self - avoiding walks and polygons . beyond serving to develop informed conjectures regarding more complex models ,",
    "this is relevant to areas such as statistical physics and the statistical mechanics of polymers  @xcite . for combinatorialists",
    ", we may observe that consideration of such models has served as a powerful incentive to develop new counting methods based on generating functions  @xcite , including transfer matrix methods and what is known as the `` kernel method '' .",
    "the present article focuses on a special type of self - avoiding polygons , the _ 3-sided prudent polygons _ ( to be defined shortly  see definition  [ prud - def ] in section  [ prud - sec ] ) , when these are enumerated according to area .",
    "roughly , a walk is prudent if it never takes a step towards an already occupied site and it is 2- , 3- , 4-sided if it has , respectively , 2 , 3 , or 4 allowed directions of growth ; a prudent polygon is a prudent walk that is almost closed . for area  @xmath3",
    ", we will obtain a precise asymptotic formula ( theorem  [ thm - asy0 ] below ) , @xmath29 one that has several distinguishing features : @xmath30  the critical exponent is the _ transcendental number _",
    "@xmath31 , in sharp contrast with previously known examples where it is invariably a `` small '' rational number ; @xmath32  the multiplier  @xmath33 is no longer a constant , but a bounded quantity that _ oscillates _ around the value @xmath34 and does so with a minute amplitude of @xmath35 .",
    "the oscillations can not be revealed by any standard numerical analysis of the counting sequence  @xmath36 , but such a phenomenon may well be present in other models , and , if so , it could change our whole view of the asymptotic behaviour of such models .    * and results of the paper . *",
    "prudent walks are defined in section  [ prud - sec ] , where we also introduce the 2-sided , 3-sided , and 4-sided varieties .",
    "the enumeration of 2- and 3-sided walks and polygons by _ perimeter _ is the subject of insightful papers by bousquet - mlou  @xcite and schwerdtfeger  @xcite who obtained both exact generating function expressions and precise asymptotic results . in subsections  [ 2prud - subsec][4prud - subsec ]",
    ", we provide the algebraic derivation of the corresponding area results : the enumeration of _ 2- and 3- sided polygons according to area _",
    "is treated there ; see theorem  [ thm:3sided_gen_func ] for our first main result . for completeness",
    ", we also derive a functional equation for the generating function of 4-sided prudent polygons ( according to area ) , which parallels an incremental construction of  @xcite  this functional equation suffices to determine the counting sequence in polynomial time .",
    "section  [ sec : asymptotics ] , dedicated to the asymptotc analysis of the number of 3-sided prudent polygons , constitutes what we feel to be the main contribution of the paper .",
    "we start from a @xmath2-hypergeometric representation of the generating function of interest , @xmath37 , and proceed to analyse its singular structure : it is found that @xmath37 has poles at a sequence of points that accumulate geometrically fast to  @xmath38 ; then , the mellin transform technology  @xcite provides access to the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath37 , as @xmath39 in extended regions of the complex plane",
    ". singularity analysis  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.vivii ) finally enables us to determine the asymptotic form of the coefficients  @xmath36 ( see theorem  [ thm - asy0 ] ) and even derive a complete asymptotic expansion ( theorem  [ thm - asy1 ] ) . as already mentioned , the non - standard character of the asymptotic phenomena found is a distinctive feature .",
    "section  [ conclu - sec ] concludes the paper with brief remarks relating to asymptotic methodology .",
    "in particular , experiments suggest that similar asymptotic phenomena are likely to be encountered in the enumeration of 4-sided prudent polygons .",
    "a preliminary announcement of the results of the present paper is the object of the communication  @xcite .",
    "one interesting sub - class of self - avoiding walks ( saws ) for which a number of exact solutions have been recently found are _ prudent _ walks",
    ". introduced by pra @xcite , these are saws which never take a step towards an already occupied node .",
    "exact solutions of s on a 2-dimensional square lattice were later studied by duchi @xcite and bousquet - mlou @xcite , who were able to enumerate certain sub - classes .",
    "the enumeration of the corresponding class of polygons is due to schwerdtfeger  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we first recall the definition of prudent walks and polygons , then summarize the known results of  @xcite relative to their enumeration by length or perimeter ; see subsection  [ prud - subsec ] , where 2- , 3- , and 4-sided prudent walks are introduced .",
    "we then examine the enumeration of polygons according to area , in each of the three non - trivial cases .",
    "the case of 2-sided polygons is easy enough ( subsection  [ 2prud - subsec ] ) .",
    "the main result of this section is theorem  [ thm:3sided_gen_func ] of subsection  [ 3prud - subsec ] , which provides an explicit generating function for 3-sided polygons ",
    "it is on this expression that our subsequent asymptotic treatment is entirely based . in the case of 4-sided ( i.e. , `` general '' ) polygons , we derive in subsection  [ 4prud - subsec ] a system of functional equations that determines the generating function and amounts to a polynomial - time algorithm for the generation of the counting sequence .",
    "we use the same classification scheme as the authors of  @xcite . by definition ,",
    "the endpoint of every always lies on the boundary of the smallest lattice rectangle which contains the entire walk , referred to here as the _ bounding box _ or just _",
    "box_. this property leads to a natural classification of s ( see figure  [ walkspoly - fig ] ) .    [ prud - def ]",
    "let @xmath40 be a prudent walk of length @xmath3 , and let @xmath41 be the prudent walk comprising the first @xmath42 steps of @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the bounding box of @xmath41",
    ". then @xmath40 is _ 1-sided _ if @xmath41 ends on the north side of @xmath43 for each @xmath44 ; _ 2-sided _ if each @xmath41 ends on the north or east sides of @xmath43 ; _ 3-sided _ if each @xmath41 ends on the north , east or west sides of @xmath43 ( with one caveat , described below ) ; and _ 4-sided _ ( or _ unrestricted _ ) if each @xmath41 may end on any side of @xmath43 .",
    "the issue with 3-sided s is encapsulated by the walk @xmath45 .",
    "if one draws the walk s box after each ( discrete ) step , then it is clear that the walk always ends on the north , east or west sides , seemingly fulfilling the 3-sided requirement .",
    "however , if the walk is taken to be continuous , then along the step @xmath46 , the endpoint is only on the south side . in general",
    "this occurs when a walk steps from the south - east corner of its box to the south - west corner ( or vice versa ) when the box has width one and non - zero height . allowing such walks forces us to account for structures like those in figure  [ pathological - fig ] ; while this is certainly possible",
    ", it complicates a number of rational terms and contributes little to the asymptotic behaviour of the model . for this reason",
    "we follow the examples of bousquet - mlou and schwerdtfeger @xcite and exclude these cases .",
    "an equivalent definition of the 3-sided walks considered here is to forbid two types of steps : when the box has non - zero width , a south step may not be followed by a west ( resp . east ) step when the walk is on the east ( resp .",
    "west ) side of the box .",
    "* ( length ) .",
    "*    the enumeration of 1-sided s ( also known as _ partially directed walks _ ) is straightforward , and the generating function for such walks is rational  we will not discuss these any further .",
    "duchi @xcite successfully found the generating function for 2-sided walks , showing it to be algebraic .",
    "bousquet - mlou @xcite solved the problem of 3-sided s , finding the generating function to be non - d - finite .",
    "for the unrestricted case , functional equations were found by both duchi and bousquet - mlou , but at present these equations remain unsolved .    the dominant singularity of the generating functions for 2-sided and 3-sided s is a simple pole at @xmath47 , the smallest real root of @xmath48 .",
    "dethridge and guttmann @xcite conjecture that the same is true for unrestricted s , based on a computer - generated series of 100 terms .",
    "they also conjectured that the generating function for unrestricted s is non - holonomic ( non - d - finite ) .",
    "here is a summary of known results , with the estimates tagged with a question mark  ( ? ) being conjectural ones : @xmath49 the values of the multipliers , after  @xcite , are @xmath50 , @xmath51 and ( estimated ) @xmath52 .",
    "* polygons ( perimeter ) .",
    "*    self - avoiding polygons ( saps ) are self - avoiding walks which end at a node adjacent to their starting point ( excluding walks of a single step ) .",
    "if the walk has length @xmath53 then the polygon is said to have _",

    "2-sided , etc . ) .",
    "a 1-sided starting at @xmath54 must end at @xmath55 , thus consisting only of a single row of cells and having a rational generating function .",
    "the enumeration of 2- and 3-sided s by perimeter has been addressed by schwerdtfeger @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial 2-sided s are essentially inverted bargraphs @xcite , and so the 2-sided case has an algebraic generating function .",
    "schwerdtfeger finds the 3-sided s to have a non - d - finite generating function .",
    "if @xmath56 is defined to be the half - perimeter generating function for @xmath0-sided prudent polygons ( so @xmath57 is the number of @xmath0-sided prudent polygons with perimeter @xmath58 ) , then the following holds  @xcite : @xmath30  the dominant singularity of @xmath59 is a square root singularity at @xmath60 , the unique real root of @xmath61 .",

    "schwerdtfeger has furthermore classified 4-sided s in such a way as to allow for functional equations in the generating functions to be written .",

    "the focus of this paper is on the enumeration of s by _",
    "area _ , rather than perimeter .",
    "the constructions we use here are essentially the same as schwerdtfeger s @xcite ; the resulting functional equations and their solutions , however , turn out to be quite different , as will be revealed by the peculiar singularity structure of the generating functions and the non - trival asymptotic form of the coefficients .",
    "we have modified schwerdtfeger s construction for 4-sided s slightly to allow for an easier conversion into a recursive form ( see subsection [ 4prud - subsec ] ) .",

    "it is necessary to measure more than just the area  in these cases , additional _",

    "reflection in the line @xmath83 will not invalidate the 2-sided property , so it is sufficient to enumerate those polygons ending at @xmath82 and then multiply the result by two .",
    "the underlying 2-sided can not step above the line @xmath84 , nor to any point @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",

    "the area generating function for these objects is @xmath89 .    adding these two possibilities together and",
    "doubling gives the result .",
    "when constructing 3-sided s , we will use a single catalytic variable which measures width . to do so we will need to measure bargraphs by width .",
