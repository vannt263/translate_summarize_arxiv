    "after the completion of the human genome project has provided a blueprint of the dna present in each human cell @xcite , genomics research is now focusing on the study of dna variations that occur between individuals , seeking to understand how these variations confer susceptibility to common diseases such as diabetes or cancer .",
    "the most common form of genomic variation are the so called _ single nucleotide polymorphisms _ ( snps ) , i.e. , the presence of different dna nucleotides , or _ alleles _ , at certain chromosomal locations .",
    "the vast majority of snps are _ bi - allelic _ ,",
    "i.e. , only two of the four possible dna bases are observed at the snp locus .",
    "since human cells contain two copies of each chromosome ( with the exception of sex chromosomes in males ) , both snp alleles may be present in the dna of an individual .",
    "determining the identity of alleles present in a dna sample at a given set of snp loci is called _",
    "snp genotyping_.    the continuous progress in high - throughput genomic technologies has resulted in numerous snp genotyping platforms combining a variety of allele discrimination techniques ( sequencing , direct hybridization , primer extension , allele - specific pcr , ligation , and cleavage , etc . ) , detection mechanisms ( fluorescence , mass spectrometry , etc . ) and reaction formats ( solution phase , solid support , bead arrays ) , see , e.g. , @xcite for comprehensive reviews . however , current technologies still offer an insufficient degree of multiplexing ( below 10,000 snps per assay ) for fully - powered genome wide disease association studies that require genotyping of large sets of user - selected snps @xcite .",
    "the highest throughput is currently achieved by high - density mapping arrays produced by affymetrix , which can simultaneously genotype a fixed set of about 250,000 _ manufacturer selected _ snps per array . genotyping a comparable number of user - specified set of snps",
    "would require an expensive and time - consuming re - design of array probes as well as a difficult re - engineering of the primer - ligation amplification protocol .    among technologies that allow",
    "genotyping of custom sets of snps one of the most successful ones is the use of dna tag arrays @xcite .",
    "dna tag arrays consist of a set of dna strings called _ tags _ , designed such that each tag hybridizes strongly to its own _ antitag _ ( watson - crick complement ) , but to no other antitag .",
    "the flexibility of tag arrays comes from combining solid - phase hybridization with the high sensitivity of single - base extension reactions , which has also been used for snp genotyping in combination with maldi - tof mass spectrometry @xcite .",
    "a typical assay based on tag arrays performs snp genotyping using the following steps @xcite : ( 1 ) a set of _ reporter probes _ is synthesized by ligating antitags to the @xmath1 end of primers complementing the genomic sequence immediately preceding the snps of interest .",
    "( 2 ) reporter probes are hybridized in solution with the genomic sample .",
    "( 3 ) the hybridized @xmath2 ( primer ) end of reporter probes is extended by a single base in a reaction using the polymerase enzyme and dideoxynucleotides fluorescently labeled with 4 different dyes .",
    "( 4 ) reporter probes are separated from the template dna and hybridized to a tag array .",
    "( 5 ) finally , fluorescence levels are used to determine the identity of the extending dideoxynucleotides .",
    "commercially available tag arrays have between 2,000 and 10,000 tags @xcite .",
    "the number of snps that can be genotyped per array is typically smaller than the number of tags since some of the tags must remain unassigned due to cross - hybridization with the primers @xcite .",
    "another factor limiting the wider use of tag arrays is the relatively high cost of synthesizing the reporter probes , which have a typical length of 40 nucleotides .    in the @xmath0-mer array format @xcite ,",
    "all @xmath3 dna probes of length @xmath0 are spotted or synthesized on the solid array substrate ( values of @xmath0 of up to @xmath4 are feasible with current high - density in - situ synthesis technologies ) .",
    "this format was originally proposed for performing _",
    "sequencing by hybridization ( sbh ) _ , which seeks to reconstruct an unknown dna sequence based on its @xmath0-mer spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , the sequence length for which unambiguous reconstruction is possible with high probability is surprisingly small @xcite , and , despite several suggestions for improvement , such as the use of gapped probes @xcite and pooling of target sequences @xcite , the sbh scheme has not become practical so far .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new genotyping assay architecture combining multiplexed solution - phase single - base extension ( sbe ) reactions with sequencing by hybridization ( sbh ) using universal dna arrays such as all @xmath0-mer arrays .",
    "snp genotyping using sbe / sbh assays requires the following steps ( see figure [ k - mer ] ) : ( 1 ) synthesizing primers complementing the genomic sequence immediately preceding snps of interest ; ( 2 ) hybridizing primers with the genomic dna ; ( 3 ) extending each primer by a single base using polymerase enzyme and dideoxynucleotides labeled with 4 different fluorescent dyes ; and finally ( 4 ) hybridizing extended primers to a universal dna array and determining the identity of the bases that extend each primer by hybridization pattern analysis .    to the best of our knowledge the combination of the two technologies in the context of snp genotyping has not been explored thus far .",
    "the most closely related genotyping assay is the generic polymerase extension assay ( pea ) recently proposed in @xcite . in pea ,",
    "short amplicons containing the snps of interest are hybridized to an all @xmath0-mers array of _ primers _ that are subsequently extended via single - base extension reactions . hence ,",
    "in pea the sbe reactions take place on solid support , similar to _ arrayed primer extension _ ( apex ) assays which use snp specific primers spotted on the array @xcite .    as in @xcite",
    ", the sbe / sbh assay leads to high array probe utilization since we hybridize to the array a large number of short extended primers .",
    "however , the main power of the method lies in the fact that the sequences of the labeled oligonucleotides hybridized to the array are a priori known ( up to the identity of extending nucleotides ) .",
    "while genotyping with sbe / sbh assays uses similar general principles as the pea assays proposed in @xcite , there are also significant differences .",
    "a major advantage of sbe / sbh is the much shorter length of extended primers compared to that of pcr amplicons used in pea .",
    "a second advantage is that _ all _ probes hybridizing to an extended primer are informative in sbe / sbh assays , regardless of array probe length ( in contrast , only probes hybridizing with a substring containing the snp site are informative in pea assays ) . as shown by the experimental results in section [ sec.results ] these advantages translate into an increase by orders of magnitude in multiplexing rate compared to the results reported in @xcite .",
    "we further note that pea s effectiveness crucially depends on the ability to amplify very short ( preferably 40bp or less ) genomic fragments spanning the snp loci of interest .",
    "this limits the achievable degree of multiplexing in pcr amplification @xcite , making pcr amplification the main bottleneck for pea assays .",
    "full flexibility in picking pcr primers is preserved in sbe / sbh assays .",
    "( a )    ( b )     +    ( c )    ( d )    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec.formulations ]",
    "we formalize two problems that arise in genotyping large sets of snps using sbe / sbh assays : the problem of partitioning a set of snps into the minimum number of `` decodable '' subsets , i.e. , subsets of snps that can be unambiguously genotyped using a single sbe / sbh assay , and that of finding a maximum decodable subset of a given set of snps .",
    "we also establish hardness results for the latter problem .",
    "in section [ sec.algos ] we propose several efficient heuristics . finally , in section [ sec.results ] we present experimental results on both randomly generated datasets and instances extracted from the ncbi dbsnp database , exploring achievable tradeoffs between the type / number of array probes and primer length on one hand and number of snps that can be assayed per array on the other .",
    "our results suggest that the sbe / sbh architecture provides a flexible and cost - effective alternative to genotyping assays currently used in the industry , enabling genotyping of up to hundreds of thousands of user - selected snps per assay .",
    "a set of snp loci can be unambiguously genotyped by sbe / sbh if every combination of snp genotypes yields a different hybridization pattern ( defined as the vector of dye colors observed at each array probe ) . to formalize the requirements of unambiguous genotyping ,",
    "let us first consider a simplified sbe / sbh assay consisting of four parallel _ single - color _ sbe / sbh reactions , one for each possible snp allele . under this scenario ,",
    "only one type of dideoxynucleotide is added to each sbe reaction , corresponding to the complement of the tested snp allele .",
    "therefore , a primer is extended in such a reaction if the tested allele is present at the snp locus probed by the primer , and is left un - extended otherwise .",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of primers used in a single - color sbe / sbh reaction involving dideoxynucleotide @xmath6a , c , g , t@xmath7 . from the resulting hybridization pattern we must be able to infer for every @xmath8 whether or not @xmath9 was extended by @xmath10 .",
    "the extension of @xmath9 by @xmath10 will result in a fluorescent signal at all array probes that hybridize with @xmath11 .",
    "however , some of these probes can give a fluorescent signal even when @xmath9 is not extended by @xmath10 , due to hybridization to other extended primers .",
    "since in the worst case _ all _ other primers are extended , it must be the case that at least one of the probes that hybridize to @xmath11 does not hybridize to any other extended primer .",
    "formally , let @xmath12 be the set of array probes .",
    "for every string @xmath13 , let the _ spectrum of @xmath14 in @xmath15 _ , denoted @xmath16 , be the set of probes of @xmath15 that hybridize with @xmath14 .",
    "under the assumption of perfect hybridization , @xmath16 consists of those probes of @xmath15 that are watson - crick complements of substrings of @xmath14 .",
    "then , a set of primers @xmath5 is said to be _",
    "decodable _ with respect to extension @xmath10 if and only if , for every @xmath8 , @xmath17    decoding constraints ( [ 1-color - weak ] ) can be directly extended to 4-color sbe / sbh experiments , in which each type of extending base is labeled by a different fluorescent dye . as before ,",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of primers , and , for each primer @xmath8 , let @xmath18 be the set of possible extensions of @xmath9 , i.e. , watson - crick complements of corresponding snp alleles .",
    "if we assume that any combination of dyes can be detected at an array probe location , unambiguous decoding is guaranteed if , for every @xmath8 and every extending nucleotide @xmath19 , @xmath20    in the following , we refine ( [ 4-color - weak ] ) to improve practical reliability of sbe / sbh assays .",
    "more precisely , we impose additional constraints on the set of probes considered to be _ informative _ for each snp allele .",
    "first , to enable reliable genotyping of genomic samples that contain snp alleles at very different concentrations ( as a result of uneven efficiency in the pcr amplification step or of pooling dna from different individuals ) , we require that a probe that is informative for a certain snp locus must not hybridize to primers corresponding to different snp loci , _ regardless of their extension_. second , since recent studies by naef et al . @xcite suggest that fluorescent dyes can significantly interfere with oligonucleotide hybridization on solid support , possibly destabilizing hybridization to a complementary probe on the array , in this paper we use a conservative approach and require that each probe that is informative for a certain snp allele must hybridize to a strict substring of the corresponding primer . on the other hand ,",
    "informative probes are still required not to hybridize with any other extended primer , even if such hybridizations involve fluorescently labeled nucleotides .",
    "finally , we introduce a _ decoding redundancy _ parameter @xmath21 , and require that each snp have at least @xmath22 informative probes , i.e. , probes that hybridize to the corresponding primer but do not hybridize to any other extended primer .",
    "such a redundancy constraint facilitates reliable genotype calling in the presence of hybridization errors .",
    "clearly , the larger the value of @xmath22 , the more hybridization errors that can be tolerated .",
    "if a simple majority voting scheme is used for making allele calls , the assay can tolerate up to @xmath23 hybridization errors involving the @xmath22 informative probes of each snp .",
    "furthermore , since the informative probes of a snp are required to hybridize _ exclusively _ with the primer corresponding to the snp , the redundancy requirement provides a powerful mechanism for detecting and gauging the extent of hybridization errors .",
    "indeed , each unintended hybridization at an informative probe for a bi - allelic snp has a dye complementary to one of the snp alleles with probability of only 1/2 , and the probability that @xmath0 such errors pass undetected decreases exponentially in @xmath0 .",
    "the refined set of constraints is captured by the following definition , where , for every primer @xmath24 and set of extensions @xmath25 , we let @xmath26    [ def.strong-primer ] a set of primers @xmath5 is said to be _ strongly @xmath22-decodable _ with respect to extension sets @xmath27 , @xmath8 , if and only if , for every @xmath8 , @xmath28    note that testing whether or not a given set of primers is strongly @xmath22-decodable can be easily accomplished in time linear in the total length of the primers .    genotyping a large set of snps",
    "will , in general , require more than one sbe / sbh assay .",
    "this rises the problem of partitioning a given set of snps into the smallest number of subsets that can each be genotyped using a single sbe / sbh assay . for each snp locus",
    "there are typically two different primers that can be used for genotyping . as shown in @xcite for the case of snp genotyping using tag arrays , exploiting this degree of freedom significantly increases achievable multiplexing rates .",
    "therefore , we next extend our definitions to capture this degree of freedom .",
    "let @xmath29 be the _ pool of primers _ that can be used to genotype the snp at locus @xmath30 .",
    "similarly to definition [ def.strong-primer ] , we have :    [ def.strong-pool ] a set of primer pools @xmath31 is said to be _ strongly @xmath22-decodable _ if and only if there is a primer @xmath32 in each pool @xmath29 such that @xmath33 is strongly @xmath22-decodable with respect to the respective extension sets @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    ".    primers @xmath36 above are called the _ representative primers _ of pools @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the snp partitioning problem can then be formulated as follows :     * minimum pool partitioning problem ( mppp ) : * _ given primer pools @xmath31 , associated extension sets @xmath27 , @xmath38 , probe set @xmath15 , and redundancy @xmath22 , find a partitioning of @xmath5 into the minimum number of strongly @xmath22-decodable subsets .",
    "_    a natural strategy for solving mppp , similar to the well - known greedy algorithm for the set cover problem , is to find a maximum strongly @xmath22-decodable subset of pools , remove it from @xmath5 , and then repeat the procedure until no more pools are left in @xmath5 .",
    "this greedy strategy for solving mppp has been shown to empirically outperform other algorithms for solving the similar partitioning problem for pea assays @xcite . in the case of sbe / sbh ,",
    "the optimization involved in the main step of the greedy strategy is formalized as follows :     * maximum @xmath22-decodable pool subset problem ( mdpsp ) : * _ given primer pools @xmath31 , associated extension sets @xmath27 , @xmath38 , probe set @xmath15 , and redundancy @xmath22 , find a strongly @xmath22-decodable subset @xmath39 of maximum size .",
    "in addition , for each pool @xmath40 , find its representative primer . _    unfortunately , as shown in next theorem , mdpsp is np - hard even for the case when the redundancy parameter is 1 and each pool has exactly one primer .",
    "[ theorem.mdpsphard ] mdpsp is np - hard , even when restricted to instances with @xmath41 and @xmath42 for every @xmath43 .",
    "we will use a reduction from the _ maximum induced matching _ problem in bipartite graphs , which is defined as follows :    * maximum induced matching ( mim ) problem in bipartite graphs : * _ given a bipartite graph @xmath44 , find maximum size subsets @xmath45 , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 such that the subgraph of @xmath48 induced by @xmath49 is a matching . _",
    "the mim problem in bipartite graphs is known to be np - hard even for graphs with maximum degree 3 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath44 be such a bipartite graph with maximum degree 3 .",
    "without loss of generality we may assume that every vertex in @xmath48 has degree at least 1 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath50 the _ neighborhood _ of vertex @xmath51 , i.e. , the set of vertices adjacent with @xmath52 in @xmath48 .",
    "we construct an instance of mdpsp as follows : let @xmath41 and @xmath53 . for every @xmath54",
    "we add to @xmath15 a distinct probe @xmath55a , t@xmath56 ; note that this can be done since @xmath57a , t@xmath58 by our choice of @xmath59 . for every @xmath60 , with neighborhood @xmath61 , we construct a primer @xmath62c@xmath63c@xmath64 and set @xmath65 .",
    "we use a similar construction for vertices @xmath66 with only 1 or 2 neighbors . note that in each case the pool @xmath67 consists of a single primer @xmath68 of length at most @xmath69 . for each constructed primer @xmath9 ,",
    "the set of possible extensions is defined as @xmath70g , c@xmath7 . since the probes of @xmath15 contain only a s and t s , for every primer @xmath68 , @xmath66 , @xmath71    let @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , be subsets of vertices such that @xmath49 induces a matching in @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath72 .",
    "for every @xmath73 , exactly one of @xmath52 s neighbors , denoted @xmath74 , appears in @xmath75 , because @xmath76 induces a matching .",
    "furthermore , for each @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and therefore @xmath79 .",
    "thus , for every @xmath73 , @xmath80 which means that @xmath81 is a strongly 1-decodable subset of pools of the same size as the induced matching of @xmath48 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath81 be a strongly 1-decodable subset of @xmath5 , and let @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath81 is 1-decodable , for every primer @xmath68 with @xmath83 , there must exist a probe @xmath84 such that @xmath85 and @xmath86 for every @xmath87 . because @xmath88 , it follows that every vertex @xmath89 has a neighbor @xmath54 that is not a neighbor of any other @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath90 be such a neighbor ( pick @xmath90 arbitrarily if more than one vertex in @xmath91 satisfies above property ) , and let @xmath92 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath76 induce a matching of size @xmath93 in @xmath48 .",
    "thus , for every integer @xmath0 , there is a one - to - one correspondence between induced matchings of size @xmath0 in @xmath48 and strongly 1-decodable subsets of @xmath0 pools in the constructed instance of mdpsp , and np - hardness of mdpsp follows .",
    "the reduction in the proof of theorem [ theorem.mdpsphard ] preserves the size of the optimal solution , and therefore any hardness of approximation result for the mim in bipartite graphs will also hold for mdpsp , even when restricted to instances with @xmath41 and @xmath42 for every @xmath43 . since duckworth et al .",
    "@xcite proved that it is np - hard to approximate mim in bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3 within a factor of 6600/6659 , we get :    [ corol.apx-hard ] it is np - hard to approximate mdpsp within a factor of 6600/6659 , even when restricted to instances with @xmath41 and @xmath42 for every @xmath43 .",
    "in this section we describe three heuristic approaches to mdpsp .",
    "the first one is a naive greedy algorithm that sequentially evaluates the primers in the given pools in an arbitrary order .",
    "the algorithm picks a primer @xmath9 to be the representative of pool @xmath43 if @xmath9 together with the representatives already picked satisfy condition ( [ 4-color - strong ] ) .",
    "the pseudocode of this algorithm , which we refer to as sequential greedy , is given in figure [ fig.seq ] .",
    "the next two algorithms are inspired by the min - greedy algorithm in @xcite , which approximates mim in @xmath94-regular graphs within a factor of @xmath95 .",
    "for the mim problem , the min - greedy algorithm picks at each step a vertex @xmath52 of minimum degree and a vertex @xmath96 , which is a minimum degree neighbor of @xmath52 .",
    "all the neighbors of @xmath52 and @xmath96 are deleted and the edge @xmath97 is added to the induced matching .",
    "the algorithm stops when the graph becomes empty .",
    "each instance of mdpsp can be represented as a bipartite _ hybridization graph _ @xmath98 , with the left side containing all primers in the given pools and the right side containing the array probes , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "there is an edge between primer @xmath9 and probe @xmath99 iff @xmath100 . as discussed in section [ sec.formulations ] , we need to distinguish between the hybridizations that involve fluorescently labeled nucleotides and those that do not .",
    "thus , for every primer @xmath9 , we let @xmath101 and @xmath102 . similarly , for each probe @xmath99 , we let @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    we considered two versions of the min - greedy algorithm when",
    "run on the bipartite hybridization graph , depending on the side from which the minimum degree vertex is picked . in the first version , referred to as minprimergreedy , we pick first a minimum degree node from the primers side , while in the second version , referred to as minprobegreedy , we pick first a minimum degree node from the probes side .",
    "thus , minprimergreedy greedy picks at each step a minimum degree primer @xmath9 and pairs it with a minimum degree probe @xmath105 .",
    "minprobegreedy greedy , selects at each step a minimum degree probe @xmath106 and pairs it with a minimum degree primer @xmath9 in @xmath107 . in both algorithms , all neighbors of @xmath9 and @xmath106 and",
    "their incident edges are removed from @xmath48 . also , at each step , the algorithms remove all vertices @xmath52 , for which @xmath108 .",
    "these deletions ensure that the primers @xmath9 selected at each step satisfy condition ( [ 4-color - strong ] ) .",
    "both algorithms stop when the graph becomes empty .    as described so far , the minprimergreedy and minprobegreedy algorithms work when each pool contains only one primer and when the redundancy is 1 .",
    "we extended the two variants to handle pools of size greater than 1 by simply removing from the graph all primers @xmath109 when picking primer @xmath9 from pool @xmath110 .",
    "if the redundancy @xmath22 is greater than 1 , then whenever we pick a primer @xmath9 , we also pick it s @xmath22 probe neighbors from @xmath111 with the smallest degrees ( breaking ties arbitrarily ) .",
    "the primer neighbors of all these @xmath22 probes will then be deleted from the graph . moreover",
    ", the algorithm maintains the invariant that @xmath112 for every primer @xmath9 and @xmath113 for every probe @xmath106 by removing primers / probes for which the degree decreases below these bounds .",
    "figures [ fig.min-primer ] and [ fig.min-probe ] give the pseudocode for the minprimergreedy , respectively the minprobegreedy greedy algorithms . for the sake of clarity , they use two subroutines for removing a primer vertex , respectively a probe vertex , which are described in figures [ fig.remove-primer ] and [ fig.remove-probe ] .    algorithms minprimergreedy and minprobegreedy can be implemented efficiently using a fibonacci heap for maintaining the degrees of primers , respectively of probes .",
    "let @xmath114 be the total number of primers in the @xmath115 pools , @xmath116 be the number of probes in @xmath15 , and @xmath0 be the size of the @xmath22-decodable set returned by the algorithm .",
    "since each primer has bounded degree , the sorting of probe degrees requires @xmath117 total time .",
    "the total number of edges in the hybridization graph is @xmath118 . by using a fibonacci heap , finding a minimum degree primer ( probe )",
    "can be done in @xmath119 ( respectively @xmath120 ) and each primer degree update can be done in amortized @xmath121 time .",
    "thus , the total runtime for minprimergreedy algorithm is @xmath122 , and the total runtime for minprobegreedy algorithm is @xmath123 .",
    "we considered two types of data sets :    * randomly generated datasets containing between 1,000 to 200,000 pools with 1 or 2 primers of length between 10 and 30 . * two - primer pools representing over 9 million reference snps in human chromosomes 1 - 22 ,",
    "x , and y extracted from the ncbi dbsnp database build 125 .",
    "we disregarded reference snps for which available flanking sequence was insufficient for determining two non - degenerate primers of desired length ( due , e.g. , to the presence of degenerate bases near the snp locus ) .",
    "we used two types of array probe sets .",
    "first , we used probe sets containing all @xmath0-mers , for @xmath0 between 8 and 10 .",
    "all @xmath0-mer arrays are well studied in the context of sequencing by hybridization . however , a major drawback of all @xmath0-mer arrays is that the @xmath0-mers have a wide range of melting temperatures , making it difficult to ensure reliable hybridization results . for short oligonucleotides , a good approximation of the melting temperature",
    "is obtained using the simple 2 - 4 rule of wallace @xcite , according to which the melting temperature of a probe is approximately twice the number of a and t bases , plus four times the number of c and g bases . as in @xcite , we define the _ weight _ of a dna string to be the number of a and t bases plus twice the number of c and g bases . for a given integer @xmath124 , a dna string is called a @xmath124-token if it has a weight @xmath124 or more and all its proper suffixes have weight strictly less than @xmath124 . since the weight of a @xmath124-token is either @xmath124 or @xmath125 , it follows that the 2 - 4 rule computed melting temperature of all @xmath124-tokens varies in a range of about @xmath126c . in our experiments we used probe sets consisting of all @xmath124-tokens , with @xmath124 varying between 11 and 13 .",
    "the considered values of @xmath0 and @xmath124 were picked such that the resulting number of probes is representative of current array manufacturing technologies : there are roughly 65,000 8-mers , 262,000 9-mers , 1 million 10-mers , 86,000 11-tokens , 236,000 12-tokens , and 645,000 13-tokens  the smaller probe sets can be spotted using current oligonucleotide printing robots , while the larger probe sets can be synthesized in situ using photolithographic techniques .      in a first set of experiments on the randomly generated datasets we compared the three mdpsp algorithms on instances with primer length set to 20 , which is the typical length used , e.g. , in genotyping using tag arrays . in these experiments",
    "the set of possible extensions was considered to be @xmath127a , c , t , g@xmath7 for all primers .",
    "such a conservative choice gives an estimate of multiplexing rates achievable by sbe / sbh assays in more demanding genomic analyses such as microorganism identification by dna barcoding @xcite , in which a primer ( typically referred to as a _ distinguisher _ in this context ) may be extended by any of the dna bases in different microorganisms .",
    "the results of these experiments for all @xmath0-mer and all @xmath124-token probe sets are presented in tables [ table.set1.k ] and [ table.set1.c ] , respectively .",
    "the results show that using the flexibility of picking primers from either strand of the genomic sequence yields an improvement of up to 10% in the number of @xmath22-decodable pools .",
    "the minprobegreedy algorithm typically produces better results compared to the minprimergreedy variant . on the other hand , neither sequential greedy nor minprobegreedy dominates the other algorithms for all range of instance parameters  sequential greedy generally gives the better results for @xmath0-mer experiments with high redundancy values , while minprobegreedy generally gives better results for @xmath0-mer experiments with large number of pools and low redundancy and for @xmath124-token experiments .    in the second set of experiments we ran the three mdpsp algorithms on datasets with the same primer length of 20 , pool size of 2 , and with the number of possible extensions of each primer set to 4 as in dna - barcoding applications , and to 2 as in snp genotyping .",
    "the results for all @xmath0-mer and all @xmath124-token probe sets are given in tables [ table.set2.k ] and [ table.set2.c ] .",
    "the relative performance of the algorithms is similar to that observed in the first set of experiments .",
    "as expected , taking into account the reduced number of possible extensions increases the size of computed decodable pool subsets , often by more than 5% .    in the third set of experiments we explored the degree of freedom given by the primer length .",
    "for any fixed array probe set and redundancy requirement , we need a minimum primer length to be able to satisfy constraints ( [ 4-color - strong ] ) .",
    "increasing the primer length beyond this minimum primer length is often beneficial , as it increases the number of array probes that hybridize with the primer .",
    "however , if primer length increases too much , an increasing number of these probes become non - specific , and the multiplexing rate starts to decline .",

    "<S> despite much progress over the past decade , current single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) genotyping technologies still offer an insufficient degree of multiplexing when required to handle user - selected sets of snps . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new genotyping assay architecture combining multiplexed solution - phase single - base extension ( sbe ) reactions with sequencing by hybridization ( sbh ) using universal dna arrays such as all @xmath0-mer arrays . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to pcr amplification of genomic dna , snp genotyping using sbe / sbh assays involves the following steps : ( 1 ) synthesizing primers complementing the genomic sequence immediately preceding snps of interest ; ( 2 ) hybridizing these primers with the genomic dna ; ( 3 ) extending each primer by a single base using polymerase enzyme and dideoxynucleotides labeled with 4 different fluorescent dyes ; and finally ( 4 ) hybridizing extended primers to a universal dna array and determining the identity of the bases that extend each primer by hybridization pattern analysis . under the assumption of perfect hybridization , unambiguous genotyping of a set of snps requires selecting primers upstream of the snps such that each primer hybridizes to at least one array probe that hybridizes to no other primer that can be extended by a common base . </S>",
    "<S> our contributions include a study of multiplexing algorithms for sbe / sbh genotyping assays and preliminary experimental results showing the achievable tradeoffs between the number of array probes and primer length on one hand and the number of snps that can be assayed simultaneously on the other . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the problem of selecting a maximum size subset of snps that can be unambiguously genotyped in a single sbe / sbh assay is np - hard , and propose efficient heuristics with good practical performance . </S>",
    "<S> our heuristics take into account the freedom of selecting primers from both strands of the genomic dna as well as the presence of disjoint allele sets among genotyped snps . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our heuristics can enforce user - specified redundancy constraints facilitating reliable genotyping in the presence of hybridization errors . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results on datasets both randomly generated and extracted from the ncbi dbsnp database suggest that the sbe / sbh architecture provides a flexible and cost - effective alternative to genotyping assays currently used in the industry , enabling genotyping of up to hundreds of thousands of user - specified snps per assay . </S>"
