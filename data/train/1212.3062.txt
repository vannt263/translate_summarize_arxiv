    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite , which relates a string theory in ads spacetime to a conformal field theory living on its boundary , has motivated the development of dual gravity models to describe strongly correlated systems in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the gravitational duals to the high temperature superconducting systems consist of a black hole in an ads spacetime with a complex scalar field coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field @xcite .",
    "when the temperature of the black hole is below a critical temperature @xmath0 , the bulk configuration becomes unstable and experiences a second order phase transition , which exhibit the behavior of the superconductor in the boundary dual cft @xcite .",
    "considering the potential applications to the condensed matter physics , many authors have constructed various s- , p- and d - wave holographic superconductor models in the ads black hole background , for reviews , see ref . @xcite and references therein .    besides the bulk ads black hole spacetime ,",
    "the ads soliton is a gravitational configuration which has lower energy than the ads space in the poincar coordinates , but has the same boundary topology as the ricci flat black hole and the ads space in the poincar coordinates @xcite . using a five - dimensional ads soliton background coupled to a maxwell field and a scalar field , nishioka _ et al . _",
    "first constructed a model describing an insulator / superconductor phase transition at zero temperature in the probe limit where the backreaction of matter fields on the spacetime metric is neglected @xcite .",
    "it is found that when the chemical potential is sufficiently large beyond a critical value @xmath1 , the ads soliton becomes unstable to form scalar hair and a second order phase transition can happen , which can be used to describe the transition between the insulator and superconductor .",
    "along this line , there have been accumulated interest to study various insulator and superconductor phase transitions in different theories of gravity @xcite .    in the previous papers @xcite",
    ", we extended the gravitational construction to include a ricci flat ads soliton in gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite and observed that the higher curvature corrections make it harder for the insulator / superconductor phase transition to occur .",
    "as a matter of fact , in order to understand the influences of the @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the t hooft coupling ) corrections on the holographic dual models , it is interesting to consider the higher derivative correction related to the gauge field besides the curvature correction to the gravity .",
    "recently , wu _ et al .",
    "_ constructed an s - wave holographic dual model with weyl corrections in order to explore the effects beyond the large @xmath5 limit on the holographic superconductor @xcite .",
    "they found that the higher weyl corrections make it easier for the condensation to form , which is in strong contrast to the higher curvature corrections @xcite . in the st@xmath6ckelberg mechanism , rich physics in the phase transition of the holographic superconductor with weyl corrections",
    "has been observed @xcite .",
    "more recently , the authors of @xcite studied the p - wave holographic superconductor model with weyl corrections and their results showed that the effect of weyl corrections on the condensation is similar to that of the s - wave model . considering that the increasing interest in investigation of weyl corrections @xcite , in this work we will consider the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition model with weyl corrections to the usual maxwell field @xcite in the probe limit , which has not been constructed as far as we know .",
    "note that the variational method for the sturm - liouville ( s - l ) eigenvalue problem @xcite , which was first developed by siopsis and therrien to analytically calculate the critical exponent near the critical temperature @xcite , is very effective to obtain the results on the condensation and the critical phenomena both in ads black hole backgrounds @xcite and ads soliton backgrounds @xcite .",
    "thus , we will generalize the s - l method to study holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition with weyl corrections in the ads soliton background .",
    "it is not trivial to analytically study the condensation and the phase transition by taking into account of the influence of the weyl couplings .",
    "besides to be used to check numerical computation , the analytic investigation can clearly present the critical exponent of the system at the critical point and the influence of the weyl correction terms on the phase transition .",
    "the plan of the work is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we explore the p - wave insulator / superconductor phase transition with weyl corrections . in particular , we calculated the critical chemical potential of the system as well as the relations of condensed values of operators and the charge density with respect to @xmath7 . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the s - wave case .",
    "we conclude in the last section with our main results .",
    "in this section , we will study the model of the p - wave insulator / superconductor phase transition with weyl corrections in the five - dimensional ads soliton spacetime by considering an @xmath8 yang - mills action with weyl corrections in the bulk theory @xcite @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the five - dimensional gravitational constant , @xmath11 is the ads radius , @xmath12 is the yang - mills coupling constant , and @xmath13 is the so - called weyl coupling parameter which satisfies @xmath14 @xcite .",

    ", we will construct the model of holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition in the probe limit where the backreaction of matter fields on the metric can be neglected . due to the scaling symmetries of the system for the case of the p - wave @xcite",
    ", we can see from the action ( [ p - system ] ) that the probe limit can be obtained safely if the coupling constant @xmath12 is large enough , i.e. , @xmath22 . without loss of generality",

    ", the background metric is a five - dimensional ads soliton @xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the tip of the soliton which is a conical singularity in this solution .",
    "it should be noted that we can remove the singularity by imposing a period @xmath27 for the coordinate @xmath28 .",

    "the condensation of @xmath37 will spontaneously break the @xmath35 gauge symmetry and induce a phase transition , which can be interpreted as a p - wave insulator and superconductor phase transition in the boundary field theory .    from the yang - mills action with weyl corrections ( [ p - system ] )",
