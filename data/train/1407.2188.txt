    "in the fifty years since the first report of the surgeon general s advisory committee on smoking and health @xcite the smoking epidemic has been responsible for more than 20 million deaths in the united states alone @xcite , and continues to be responsible for over 6 million deaths worldwide each year @xcite .",
    "the strong social component of the dynamics of smoking prevalence has been modelled mathematically @xcite , and examined statistically through analysis of social network data @xcite and survey data @xcite .",
    "however , whereas previous works tend to focus on the micro - level , in this paper we investigate how social aspects of smoking affect its prevalence at the societal level .",
    "significant inter - country differences exist in smoking prevalence @xcite .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "1(a)shows smoking prevalence estimates over most of the past century for sweden and the usa , obtained from surveys and cigarette consumption data ( see section 3 and appendix [ a : data ] ) . in both countries ,",
    "smoking prevalence increased rapidly starting from the early decades of the 20^th^ century and reached a peak in the 1960s1980s era when the adverse health effects of smoking became widely known @xcite , after which smoking prevalence declined rapidly .",
    "however , there are conspicuous differences between the curves : the rate of smoking adoption and cessation before and after the peak is much greater in the us than in sweden , and the peak in prevalence in the us occurs much earlier than in sweden .     versus idv ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) for seven oecd countries .",
    "( c ) average slope @xmath2 versus idv ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) for seven oecd countries .",
    "( d ) peak year @xmath5 in cigarette consumption versus idv in a set of 25 countries ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "the seven oecd countries considered for the mathematical model ( and displayed in panels ( b - c ) ) are indicated by dots ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , and the remaining 18 countries are indicated by asterisks . for panels",
    "( b - d ) the line of best fit is given by a solid line .",
    "for panel ( d ) the line of best fit is calculated using data from all 25 countries . ]    in this paper we present a new mathematical model of the social spreading of smoking that incorporates the concepts of individual utility ( including awareness of health effects ) , peer influence and social inertia .",
    "we propose an interpretation for our model in the context of societal individualism / collectivism and test the model s predictions and interpretation in three separate phases , see fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] .",
    "first , we compile smoking prevalence data spanning the past century for seven oecd countries and find good agreement between this data and the fitted model .",
    "second , the parameter in our model that we interpret as the degree of societal collectivism ( see section [ sec : spec ] ) , and that we fit to smoking prevalence data , is found to be significantly negatively correlated to an established measure of societal individualism ( hofstede s idv @xcite ) .",
    "thirdly , the central role played by societal individualism / collectivism in our model motivates us to investigate directly the role that individualism ( as measured by hofstede s idv ) plays in observed historical tobacco use data .",
    "specifically , we find that idv is significantly positively correlated to the average rate of increase in smoking prevalence ( @xmath2 ) in seven oecd countries for which smoking prevalence data is available , and that it is significantly negatively correlated to the peak year of tobacco consumption ( @xmath5 ) for 25 countries in which tobacco consumption data are available .",
    "these findings are interpreted according to our modelling framework , which offers an explanation for the compelling effects of individualism / collectivism on smoking prevalence .",
    "we begin formulating our model by observing that individuals derive utility from smoking via two mechanisms .",
    "first , they derive utility directly from the act of smoking ( _ individual utility _ ) .",
    "second , they derive utility from social interaction with other smokers ( _ social utility _ ) .",
    "we note that social utility commonly manifests itself in the form of peer influence or peer pressure @xcite .",
    "we then proceed using a modelling framework that explicitly accounts for the effect of competition between individual and social utilities , and that was first applied to explore the temporal dynamics of language death and religious affiliation as binary choice problems @xcite .",
    "specifically , we propose the model @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 $ ] is the fraction of smokers in the population ( i.e. , the prevalence ) , @xmath12 $ ] is the individual utility from smoking , and the constant @xmath13 determines the timescale of the equation .",
    "the interpretation of the positive term in eq .",
    "is , therefore , that non - smokers @xmath14 take up smoking at a rate proportional to the _ total utility _ derived from smoking , @xmath15 , which is the weighted product of the individual utility from smoking @xmath16 and the social utility from interactions with other smokers @xmath17 , with weighting determined by the constant parameter @xmath18 . since societies with large @xmath18 weigh social utility more heavily than individual utility when calculating total utility , we call @xmath18 the _ relative conformity parameter_. we therefore interpret societies with large @xmath18 to be more collectivistic ( or less individualistic ) than societies with small @xmath18",
    ". the interpretation of the negative term in eq .",
    ", which models smoking cessation , follows analogously : smokers @xmath17 cease smoking at a rate proportional to the total utility derived from non - smoking , @xmath19 , which is the weighted product of the individual utility from non - smoking @xmath20 and the social utility from interactions with other non - smokers @xmath14 , where we have normalized individual utilities from smoking @xmath16 and from non - smoking @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .",
    "we note that this modelling framework is conceptually consistent with the findings presented in @xcite : that personal attitudes about smoking have a stronger influence on smoking behaviour in individualistic countries than in collectivistic countries .",
    "next , we observe that a combination of factors , including advances in our understanding of the health effects of smoking and public policy initiatives designed to curb smoking , have likely reduced individual utility from smoking ( @xmath16 ) over the past century .",
    "thus , in a significant departure from previous work that treats individual utility as a constant @xcite , we account for this decline in individual utility by using the cumulative number of scholarly articles on the health effects of smoking ( @xmath23 ) as a proxy for the reduction in individual utility over the past century .",
    "specifically , following the principle of temporal discounting @xcite , we assume that each additional article published is discounted by the factor @xmath24 $ ] so that for year @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the limiting individual utilities from smoking when there is no knowledge and perfect knowledge of the adverse effects of smoking , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are parameters to be fitted to observational data .",
    "[ fig : s1 ] shows the cumulative number of scholarly articles on the health effects of smoking @xmath23 ( see appendix [ a : proxy ] and esm data file _ lang_supporting_data1.txt _ ) , and the resulting individual utility from smoking @xmath30 , as defined in eq .  , for various values of @xmath29 .",
    "we remark that this approach leads to better fits between model output and observational data than alternatives that do not directly take into account the effect of increased scientific understanding of health effects ( see appendices [ a : fit ] and [ a : alt ] ) .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "subject to eq .   requires the fitting of four parameters per country ( @xmath31 , @xmath18 , @xmath27 , and @xmath32 ) and two parameters @xmath33 and @xmath29 that we take equal for all countries in the data set ( see appendix [ a : fit ] ) .",
    "we determine these parameters by fitting them to historical smoking prevalence data .",
    "such historical data ( mostly obtained by surveys ) is available for a set of 24 oecd countries , but unfortunately is limited to , on average , only 21.5 observations over a period of 31.4 years spanning 19602012 @xcite . as such",
    ", it misses much of the crucial period in the earlier parts of the 20th century during which smoking steadily gained popularity in many countries .",
    "however , historical national cigarette consumption data is available for the same 24 oecd countries plus romania for an average of 78.4 observations over a period of 82.2 years spanning 1900 - 2012 @xcite . in order to exploit the more abundant consumption data in our prevalence model",
    ", we assume a linear relationship between national cigarette consumption and smoking prevalence for all times where both measurements are available .",
    "we then apply this relationship to the full cigarette consumption data set to produce an estimate of historical smoking prevalence ( @xmath34 ) over nearly the entire past century .",
    "sufficient data for this procedure is available in seven oecd countries ( for additional details , see appendix [ a : data ] ) : australia , canada , france , new zealand , sweden , the united kingdom , and the united states .",
    "figure 1(a)shows the fit of our model to data sets from the united states and sweden ( additional fits and parameter values are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : s3 ] and table [ tab : s4 ] ) .",
    "the good agreement that we found with all data sets provides support for the model .",
    "if the model and its interpretation are correct , then we expect that the fitted `` relative conformity parameter '' @xmath18 will capture something meaningful about the individualism / collectivism of a society . to test this , we compare with hofstede s idv , an established metric for societal individualism @xcite that has been evaluated in most countries .",
    "panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the comparison .",
    "as expected , the relative conformity parameter @xmath18 shows significant negative correlation with hofstede s idv ( negative because @xmath18 increases with collectivism while idv decreases with it ) .",
    "this concordance with independently assessed individualism values supports our model .      besides the correlation of @xmath18 with collectivism",
    ", we note that another prediction is implicit in model . as the relative conformity parameter increases",
    ", the model requires that changes in smoking prevalence occur more slowly ( this is true for the range of @xmath18 and @xmath35 values corresponding to the observational data ) .",
    "put another way , societies with higher levels of individualism should experience faster changes in smoking prevalence .",
    "intuitively , when smoking prevalence is low the lack of existing smokers inhibits smoking initiation more strongly in a collectivistic society than in an individualistic society .",
    "thus , we expect the average rate of increase in a collectivistic society to be smaller than in an individualistic society .",
    "in contrast , when smoking prevalence is high , and once the deleterious health effects of smoking become widely known and negatively impact individual utility from smoking , the presence of existing smokers inhibits smoking cessation more strongly in a collectivistic society than in an individualistic society . in both cases collectivism acts as a break on change in the status quo ( higher cultural inertia @xcite ) .",
    "panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] demonstrates that this is indeed the case : the average slope @xmath2 of the smoking prevalence curves leading up to the peak ( see eq",
    ".   of appendix [ a : sx ] ) increases with hofstede s idv ( shown ) and decreases with @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : s4](a ) ) . correlations are significant ( see table [ tab : s1 ] ) .",
    "this reasoning further suggests that the peak year for smoking prevalence @xmath5 should be later in collectivistic societies and earlier in individualistic countries . as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , the raw observational data are consistent with this prediction : @xmath5 is significantly negatively correlated with idv ( shown ) and significantly positively correlated with @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : s4](b ) ) .",
    "note that our assumption of a linear relationship between national cigarette consumption and smoking prevalence is not needed to establish @xmath5 , so fig .",
    "1(d)is independent of any model assumptions .",
    "we have proposed a quantitative mathematical model of the social spreading of smoking that is derived from basic principles well - documented in the sociology and social psychology literature .",
    "the model appears to match real - world smoking prevalence data from a variety of countries well ( to our knowledge , the largest historical data set of this type ever compiled ) , and all predictions of the model appear to be supported by the data . in particular , the model predicts that the level of individualism or collectivism of a society may significantly affect the temporal dynamics of smoking prevalence : the strong influence of the personal utility of smoking ( and its decrease due to increased awareness of adverse health effects ) is predicted to lead to faster adoption and cessation of smoking in individualistic societies than in more collectivistic societies .",
    "it has previously been argued that social support mechanisms in collectivistic societies make it more likely that a person will stop smoking @xcite based on findings that social support ( supportive counselors ) can help people to adhere to decisions to quit smoking @xcite .",
    "we find that , to the contrary , cessation of smoking occurs more slowly in collectivistic societies .",
    "our model suggests that this is so because social inertia will inhibit decisions to stop smoking more strongly in collectivistic societies than in individualistic societies .",
    "these results have significant implications for combating the ongoing smoking epidemic .",
    "for example , they imply that interventions designed to discourage smoking should be tailored differently in societies or social groups whose cultures differ in how they value individualism versus collectivism @xcite .",
    "more broadly , these results demonstrate that differences in culture can measurably affect the dynamics of a social spreading process , and that a mathematical model can help to illuminate this phenomenon .    despite the good match between model predictions and data ,",
    "a number of limitations remain .",
    "we have made an implicit `` mean - field '' approximation in taking social utility to be a function of the overall smoking prevalence @xmath17 , rather than the local smoking prevalence among contacts in an individual s social network .",
    "similarly , we have taken individual utility to be uniform across the population ( though not in time ) , whereas a more detailed model might allow for individual variation . as a mild justification for these assumptions ,",
    "we point out that analysis of a similar model in another context @xcite suggests that inclusion of more detail will not change qualitative predictions .",
    "we claim that the correlation of individualism with faster societal change results from a causative influence as predicted by our model .",
    "other factors such as income levels also correlate with individualism , and it s possible that what we observe is ultimately also related to gdp or other variables .",
    "we certainly can not exclude that there may be other causative factors .",
    "for example , our model in its current form is incapable of explaining differences in smoking prevalence between genders and why these inter - gender differences vary between countries @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we remark that many previously proposed causative factors for differences in observed inter - country smoking dynamics can be accounted for within our modelling framework .",
    "in particular , beliefs about the harmful effects of smoking , the price of cigarettes , socioeconomic status and inequality , and government regulation have all been cited as potential factors affecting the differences observed in inter - country smoking dynamics @xcite .",
    "each of these factors can be interpreted within our modelling framework .",
    "for example , beliefs about the harmful effects of smoking , as well as the price of cigarettes , both likely contribute directly to individual utility derived from smoking ( @xmath16 ) and from non - smoking ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "moreover , socioeconomic status may affect individual utility from smoking indirectly by affecting an individual s tolerance for risk and/or how they discount future rewards and costs ( i.e. how they discount their future health status ) @xcite .",
    "addressing the model s inability to account for gender differences in smoking prevalence and quantifying the relationship between other causative factors and model parameters are potential areas for future work .",
    "we also welcome future work comparing a variety of social contagion phenomena across societies .",
    "our model suggests that the increased cultural inertia in collectivistic societies would lead to slower change across a wide spectrum of spreading processes ( those where important changes occur in personal utility ) , a hypothesis that could be supported or rejected by further study .",
