    "thirdly , the temperature dependences of the ins peaks at 0.5 and 0.6  mev suggest that the coupling between spin and phonon in cu@xmath0 is very weak , resulting in the rigid spin state , or the long life time of the spin state .",
    "we , thus , conclude that they are the key features to explain the half - step magnetization change with the milli - second order hysteresis .",

    "we would like to thank n. aso , m. yokoyama , t. asami , y. kawamura , and j. r. d. copley for their help in our ins experiments .",
    "the site dependence of the exchange interaction ( @xmath35.@xmath39 .",
    ", @xmath105 ) also divides the @xmath13 quartet .",
    "but its contribution is small because cu@xmath0 is the approximately equatorial triangle , and indeed , our obtained parameters show small site dependence as written in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parameters ] ) .",
    "thus , the gap , or the excitation @xmath12 , mostly originates from the dm interaction .              from the ins spectrum of deuterated powder cu@xmath0 at @xmath87  k measured at dcs with @xmath106  mev (",
    "not shown ) , the parameters of the deuterated powder sample are determined by the excitations @xmath14 and @xmath15 as follows ; @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the values are almost the same as the values of the non - deuterated powder sample ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : parameters ] ) ) .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the deuterated cu@xmath0 spin cluster has almost same energy scheme as the non - deuterated cu@xmath0 spin cluster .",
    "the number of excitations from @xmath13 to @xmath22 states are four , not two .",
    "then , we also fitted the ins spectra using four fixed excitations as follows ; @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116  mev in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitting_inela ] ) .",
    "but almost same temperature dependences of the integrated intensity and peak width as fig .",
    "[ fig : decoupling ] are obtained .",
    "thus , we show the results using two excitations , @xmath14 and @xmath15 as defined in fig .  [",

    "<S> , we have determined the optimum parameters of the spin hamiltonian consisted of the antiferromagnetic exchange and the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions , which can also reproduce the magnetic susceptibility measurement . in addition , we have directly observed that the ground state quartet is split into two doublets with the energy separation of 0.103  mev using high - resolution neutron spectroscopy , which exactly corresponds to that expected from the optimum parameters obtained from the medium resolution experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependences of the integrated intensities of the 0.5 and 0.6  mev peaks are well reproduced by the boltzmann distribution of the energy levels of the model hamiltonian below 10  k. furthermore , the inelastic peaks were visible even at very high temperatures as 50  k. this indicates extraordinary weak coupling between phonons ( or any other perturbations ) and spin states in the cu@xmath0 cluster , compared to the other known molecular nanomagnets . </S>"
