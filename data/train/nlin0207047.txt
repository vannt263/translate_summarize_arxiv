    "cellular automata ( ca ) are dynamical systems characterized by discreteness in space and time . in general",
    ", they can be viewed as cells in a regular lattice updated synchronously according to a local interaction rule , where the state of each cell is restricted to a finite set of allowed values . among many applications of ca ,",
    "models of road traffic flow , first proposed by nagel and schreckenberg in 1992 @xcite , attracted substantial attention in recent years .",
    "many theoretical aspect of the nagel - schreckenberg model are still not fully understood , and therefore several simplified models have been proposed , including models based on deterministic cellular automata @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting features of these models is the fact that they can be described using two equivalent paradigms : either as one - dimensional cellular automata or as systems of interacting particles on one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the simplest example is rule 184 , one of the elementary ca rules investigated by wolfram @xcite , and later extensively studied in the context of surface growth models @xcite , as well as in the context of density classification problem @xcite .",
    "it is one of the only two ( symmetric ) non - trivial elementary rules conserving the number of active sites @xcite , and , therefore , can be interpreted as a rule governing dynamics of particles ( cars ) .",
    "particles ( cars ) move to the right if their right neighbor site is empty , and do not move if the right neighbor site is occupied , all of them moving simultaneously at each discrete time step . using terminology of lattice stochastic processes ,",
    "rule 184 can be viewed as a discrete - time version of totally asymmetric simple exclusion process .",
    "a general question which can be asked is when a given ca rule can be treated as a rule governing motion of particles , and how to determine all rules possessing this property .",
    "since the number of particles has to be conserved , it is clear that all such rules must conserve the number of nonzero sites . in @xcite , ca rules of this type and their phenomenology were investigated .    in this work",
    ", we will formalize concepts introduced in @xcite .",
    "we will prove that each conservative ca can be associated with a local mapping of particle coordinates , and we will demonstrate how such a mapping can be constructed .",
    "the set of definitions given below closely follows terminology used in @xcite , with minor modifications .",
    "let @xmath3 be a countable set with cardinality @xmath4 , which will be called a _",
    "symbol set_. if @xmath4 is finite , we will assume that @xmath5 , otherwise we will often assume @xmath6 .",
    "a _ bisequence _ over @xmath3 is a function on @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the set of bisequences over @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then @xmath11 will be often denoted by @xmath12 .",

    "@xmath14-block _ over @xmath3 is an ordered set @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "the set of all @xmath14-blocks over @xmath3 will be denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a mapping of @xmath17 into @xmath3 .",
    "the set of all such mappings , for a given @xmath13 will be denoted by @xmath18 .",

    "finally , let us define a _ global mapping _",
    "@xmath29 corresponding to a local mapping @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath9 , and let @xmath30 be defined as @xmath31 for all @xmath32",
    ". then we define @xmath33 .    for @xmath34 we can define a mapping @xmath35 , similar to @xmath36 . if @xmath9 , and if @xmath30 such that @xmath37 then , by definition , @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 .",
    "as an example , consider a set of mappings @xmath40 , which were studied in @xcite and called elementary cellular automata rules .",
    "there is @xmath41 such mappings , and it is customary , following @xcite , to assign them _ code numbers _ @xmath42 defined as @xmath43    for instance , the local mapping with code number @xmath44 , often referred to as simply _ rule 184 _ , is defined by @xmath45 it is straightforward to show that the above definition can be written in a more compact form as @xmath46 having the local mapping , we can compute @xmath22-block mappings @xmath47 .",
    "for example , @xmath48 because @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "it is a common practice to view ca as dynamical systems and to investigate trajectories of points in the bisequence space @xmath7 , where by a trajectory of a point @xmath52 we mean the sequence @xmath53 , superscript @xmath54 denoting multiple composition @xmath55    since ca are often used as model of real physical systems of a finite size , periodic boundary conditions are frequently employed . using the formalism introduced in this section ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions can be easily incorporated by assuming that the bisequence under consideration is periodic with some period @xmath56 , i.e. , there exist some @xmath57 such that @xmath58",
    ". obviously , all bisequences belonging to the trajectory of a periodic bisequence are periodic .",
    "as in any other dynamical system , symmetry and conservation laws play an important role in cellular automata .",
    "additive invariants in one - dimensional ca have been studied by hattori and takesue @xcite .",
    "they obtained conditions which guarantee the existence of additive conserved quantities , and produced a table of additive invariants for wolfram s elementary ca rules . in this work",
    ", we will consider simplest possible additive invariants , namely the number of active sites ( `` active '' meaning non - zero ) .",
    "let us start from a simple example , rule 184 introduced in the previous section .",
    "let us consider an @xmath56-periodic bisequence @xmath59 and its image under the local mapping with code number 184 , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ r184comp ] ) , @xmath60 .",
    "the number of active sites in a single period of @xmath61 ( to be referred to as simply the _ number of active sites in @xmath61 _ ) is equal to @xmath62 . the number of active sites in @xmath63 is , using eq .",
    "( [ r184comp ] ) , @xmath64 since for a periodic lattice the last two sums cancel , we obtain @xmath65 meaning that the number of active sites is conserved .    in general ,",
    "a local mapping @xmath66 will be called _ @xmath56-conservative _",
    "if for any @xmath56-periodic bisequence @xmath67 the following condition is satisfied : @xmath68 using the fact that @xmath61 is periodic , this condition can be rewritten as @xmath69 if for every @xmath70 a mapping @xmath66 is @xmath56-conservative , than it is said to be _",
    "conservative_. the following theorem @xcite is helpful in determining if a given rule is conservative .",
    "if a mapping @xmath66 is @xmath56-conservative for @xmath71 , then it is conservative .    to prove the above result",
    ", we shall show that , if @xmath72 , any equation of ( [ l - cond ] ) type , i.e. , equation expressing conservation condition for @xmath56-periodic configuration , is a linear combination of three equations which express , respectively , conservation conditions for @xmath73- , @xmath74- , and @xmath75-periodic sequences .",
    "more precisely , for all @xmath56-periodic bisequences with period @xmath56 , @xmath76 , equation  ( [ l - cond ] ) can be written @xmath77    the above rearrangement of terms - cycle in a de bruijn graph as the sum of an @xmath78-cycle , a @xmath79-cycle , and a @xmath80-cycle . ]",
    "is valid if @xmath81 , and for almost every periodic bisequence , we can choose a `` coordinate system '' ( labeling of sites ) in which it is true .",
    "the only exception is , for even @xmath56 , the bisequence with period @xmath82 .",
    "verifying ( [ eqn - decomp ] ) is in this case possible , but needs to be done with a different method ( see below ) . by induction ,",
    "relation ( [ eqn - decomp ] ) shows that the conservation condition for @xmath56-periodic bisequence is a linear combination of conservation conditions for @xmath74- and @xmath75-periodic bisequences . using similar rearrangement of terms as in ( [ eqn - decomp ] )",
    ", it can be shown that conservation conditions for @xmath75-periodic bisequences imply conservation conditions for @xmath75-periodic bisequences , concluding the proof .",
    "consider now the exception mentioned in the preceding paragraph , the bisequence @xmath82 .",
    "conservation condition for arbitrary @xmath56 reads @xmath83 if @xmath14 is even , and @xmath84 if @xmath14 is odd .",
    "that is , @xmath85 if @xmath14 is even , and @xmath86 if @xmath14 is odd . in the above two equations @xmath56",
    "does not occur at all , so obviously , if eq .",
    "( [ per1 ] ) or ( [ per2 ] ) is true for @xmath71 , it is true for any @xmath56 .    using this theorem ,",
    "if one wants to find all mappings @xmath66 for some @xmath14 which are conservative , it is enough to check which of them are @xmath79-conservative .",
    "in fact , for many mappings it is possible to show that they are _ not _ conservative ( and thus eliminate them from a list of mappings `` suspected '' for being conservative ) by employing some of their elementary properties .",
    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "if a mapping @xmath66 is conservative , then    * @xmath89 , * @xmath90 , * @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath0 is @xmath92-balanced .",
    "part ( a ) becomes obvious if we consider periodic bisequence consisting of all zeros , i.e. , containing no active sites .",
    "image of this configuration must also contain no active sites , and it is only possible if @xmath89 .",
    "proof of ( b ) is identical .",
    "part ( c ) says that among all possible configurations of arguments @xmath93 of @xmath0 ( there are @xmath94 such configurations ) , exactly half results in @xmath95 , as can be seen , for example , in definition of rule 184 ( eq .",
    "[ r184 - 01 ] ) .    to prove part ( c ) , consider periodic bisequence @xmath96 of period @xmath97 . now , let us construct a set of @xmath22 blocks @xmath98 such that @xmath99 ( superscript @xmath100 denotes here just a consecutive number of the block @xmath101 in the set @xmath102 ) .",
    "assume that we can find @xmath103 such that all blocks in @xmath102 are different .",
    "this means that each possible block of length @xmath14 occurs in @xmath102 once and only once , and therefore @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the number of 1 s in a single period of @xmath103 .    on the other hand , @xmath106 ,",
    "which is obtained from @xmath103 by replacing all zeros by ones and _ vice versa _ , must also have the same property as @xmath103 , i.e. , in a set @xmath107 such that @xmath108 , all elements are different , hence @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the number of 0 s in a single period of @xmath103 . comparing ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) we obtain @xmath111 , exactly as required .    the only problem left is to show that , indeed , for any @xmath88 , we can construct @xmath94-periodic configuration @xmath103 such that all blocks occurring in a single period of @xmath103 are different ( and therefore , constitute a set of all possible blocks of length @xmath14 ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath112 , consider @xmath103 with a period @xmath113 .",
    "one can easily check that all possible blocks of length @xmath114 occur in a single period of @xmath103 : @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 . for @xmath119 , @xmath103 with a period @xmath120",
    "has the same property .",
    "again , one can see that blocks occurring in the period of @xmath103 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , are all possible blocks of length @xmath129 .    for a general @xmath14 ,",
    "the required @xmath103 is equivalent to a hamiltonian cycle in the de bruijn graph @xcite of dimension @xmath14 ( or an eulerian cycle in the de bruijn graph of dimension @xmath130 ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that such a cycle always exists ( more precisely , for a given @xmath14 , there exist exactly @xmath131 of such cycles  see , for example , review article @xcite ) .",
    "since conservative rules conserve the number of active sites , one can identify active sites with `` particles '' which change position after each application of the rule @xmath36 , but their number does not change .",
    "therefore , instead of describing this system of particles in terms of lattice sites being occupied or empty , we can describe it by specifying list of coordinates of all particles .",
    "an _ increasing bisequence _ over @xmath2 is an increasing function on @xmath2 to @xmath2 .",
    "set of all increasing sequences over @xmath2 will be denoted by @xmath132 . if @xmath133 and @xmath134 , then @xmath135 will be often denoted by @xmath136 .",
    "now , let us define a mapping @xmath137 as follows : let @xmath138 be an increasing bisequence and let @xmath139 be defined by @xmath140 for every @xmath10 .",
    "then , by definition , @xmath141 .    using the notion of particles , @xmath142 in the above definition",
    "can be understood as a list of coordinates of particles on one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we require this list to be increasing , so no two particles occupy the same position . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath143 is just a list of occupancy numbers : for all sites , @xmath12 is either @xmath92 ( meaning site @xmath144 is occupied ) or @xmath145 ( empty site ) .",
    "transformation @xmath146 takes a list of particle coordinates @xmath142 and returns the corresponding list of occupancy numbers .",
    "for example , if in some @xmath147 we have @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , then in the corresponding @xmath151 , sites @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 are occupied , meaning that @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "note that since @xmath142 is an increasing bisequence , we can immediately conclude that the site between @xmath152 and @xmath153 as well as both sites between @xmath153 and @xmath154 must be empty , i.e. , @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "since conservative mappings conserve the number of particles , we would now like to find a local mapping which transforms coordinate lists @xmath160 with the same effect as conservative local mappings @xmath161 transform occupancy lists @xmath59 .",
