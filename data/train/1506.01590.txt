    "discrete random surfaces encoded by maps have been subject of intensive research for a long time , in the mathematical literature mainly because of their rich combinatorial and geometric structure , and in the physics literature because of their relevance to two - dimensional quantum gravity , string theory , and feynman diagrams .",
    "many exact enumerative properties of random ( planar ) maps , starting with the seminal work of tutte in the sixties @xcite , were known before methods were discovered to study their intrinsic geometric properties .",
    "perhaps the first significant progress in this direction was made in the early nineties , when watabiki introduced a _ peeling procedure _ of a random triangulated surface @xcite .",
    "this procedure shortly after lead to the first determination of a two - point function of large random triangulations @xcite , which captures the probability distribution of the geodesic distance between two random vertices .",
    "this two - point function was shown to possess a scaling limit if the distances were rescaled by the fourth root of the volume , leading to the ( now well - established ) conjecture that large random surfaces have a hausdorff dimension of four .    in the late nineties",
    "schaeffer @xcite , inspired by earlier work by cori and vauquelin @xcite , discovered a bijection between quadrangulations and labeled trees that was tailored to the study of graph distances .",
    "soon this bijection and its many generalizations , particularly the bouttier - di  francesco - guitter bijection @xcite , became the tool of choice for studying geometry of random surfaces , culminating in the proof of the convergence in the gromov - hausdorff sense of many classes of large random planar maps to a universal random continuum geometry on the sphere , known as the _",
    "brownian map_. nevertheless , the peeling procedure in various forms received renewed interest in the mathematical literature , starting with its formalization in the setting of the uniform infinite planar triangulation ( uipt , @xcite ) by angel in @xcite .",
    "it was recognized that peeling could not only be used to study geometry , but that due to its important markov properties it could be tailored towards studying many other aspects of random maps , including various forms of percolation @xcite , random walks @xcite , and some aspects of their conformal structure @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite curien and le gall revisited the geometric study of the peeling process on the uipt ( and also on the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation ( uipq ) ) , which was initiated by angel in @xcite .",
    "they found that the perimeter process , which keeps track of the length of the ( simple ) boundary of the explored region during a peeling process of the uipt , takes the form of a random walk conditioned to stay positive .",
    "the unconditioned random walk is easily seen to scale to a index-3/2 stable process with only negative jumps . the perimeter process can be obtained from this random walk by a simple doob transform ( or @xmath0-transform ) , and it follows from an invariance principle @xcite that it scales to the aforementioned stable process conditioned to stay positive .",
    "the convergence is then extended to include the volume process , which keeps track of the volume of the explored region .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend these results to the more general setting of @xmath1-boltzmann planar maps associated to arbitrary weight sequences @xmath2 .",
    "a ( finite ) @xmath1-boltzmann planar map is a random planar map with arbitrary face degrees , where the probability of picking a particular map is proportional to the product of over all faces @xmath3 of the weight @xmath4 depending on the degree @xmath5 of @xmath3 .",
    "whenever this procedure leads to a well - defined probability distribution on ( finite ) planar maps , the sequence @xmath1 is said to be _",
    "we will explicitly derive the law of the perimeter process for ( pointed ) @xmath1-boltzmann planar maps associated to such admissible weight sequences .",
    "like in the case of the uipt , the perimeter process is realized as a doob transform of a random walk which depends on @xmath1 .",
    "explicit conditions for a weight sequences to be admissible were worked out by miermont in @xcite , using the bouttier - di  francesco - guitter bijection @xcite . as we will see these quite non - trivial conditions can be recast into very simple conditions on the law of the random walk associated to the perimeter process . in fact ,",
    "in some sense the @xmath1-boltzmann planar map is more naturally characterized by this law than by the weight sequence itself . in particular , the critical weight sequences @xmath1 , which are basically sequences that are on the border of being admissible and which are the appropriate ones to study large map limits , are related to random walks that do not drift .",
    "it has recently been shown in @xcite for general critical weight sequence @xmath1 , and earlier in the more restricted setting of bipartite boltzmann planar maps in @xcite , that @xmath1-boltzmann planar maps possess a well - defined local limit , known as the infinite @xmath1-boltzmann planar map ( @xmath1-ibpm ) , as the conditioned number of vertices is taken to infinity .",
    "we will show that our peeling process naturally extends to the setting of the @xmath1-ibpm , and that the associated perimeter process , like in the case of the uipt , is obtained by conditioning the aforementioned random walk to stay positive .",
    "based on the supposed universality of the brownian map , and its local limit as the brownian plane , one expects the scaling limit of the perimeter process to agree with that of the uipt .",
    "indeed , this will turn out to be the case for a large class of critical weight sequences @xmath1 , namely the _ regular critical _ ones , and we will obtain explicit expressions for the scaling constants involved .",
    "interestingly , our description of the peeling process also covers @xmath1-ibpms associated to _ non - regular critical _ weight sequences @xmath1 which are heavy - tailed .",
    "the related finite @xmath1-boltzmann planar maps were studied by le gall and miermont in @xcite , and the metric spaces associated to the graph distances were shown to converge in the gromov - hausdorff sense to random continuum geometries distinct from the brownian map .",
    "these continuum geometries are characterized by holes corresponding to macroscopic faces in the planar maps and lead to a hausdorff dimension strictly smaller than four .",
    "we will not study the scaling limits of the non - regular @xmath1-ibpms in any detail , but we do notice that the associated perimeter processes seem to converge to stable processes ( conditioned to stay positive ) with an index smaller than @xmath6 . a natural next step , which we leave to future work , is to consider the peeling process in the setting of random planar maps coupled to @xmath7 models which are known to be closely related to heavy - tailed @xmath1-boltzmann planar maps @xcite",
    ".    the simple characterization of the perimeter ( and volume ) process of the @xmath1-ibpm opens up the possibility to study various aspects of its geometry , and percolation imposed on it .",
    "indeed , the results presented in this paper are independent of the chosen peel algorithm , meaning roughly that it does not matter in what direction or what order one chooses to explore the @xmath1-ibpm using the peeling procedure . by choosing appropriate peeling algorithms one can for instance",
    "discover the @xmath1-ibpm by balls of increasing geodesic radius with respect to different metrics associated to the planar map , including graph distance , first - passage time and dual graph distance .",
    "the known perimeter and volume processes then give information about the perimeter and volume of these geodesic balls .",
    "indeed , this was done for the uipt in @xcite in the case of the graph distance and first - passage time ( see also @xcite for the latter ) , and convergence was found to similar processes defined directly in terms of the brownian plane @xcite .",
    "we postpone similar applications of the peeling process in the setting of the @xmath1-ibpm to a future paper , in which in particular we will use the technology in this paper to derive simple formulas for the relative scaling constants associated to the various metrics .",
    "we should mention that the results in this paper should not be viewed as direct generalizations of the results by curien and le gall .",
    "first of all , the boltzmann planar maps considered here will always be of _ type 1 _ meaning that they are allowed to contain multiple edges and loops .",
    "more importantly , the _ lazy _ peeling process considered here is slightly different from the ( _ simple _ ) peeling process considered in @xcite .",
    "the difference is that we do not require the _ frontier _ , i.e. boundary of the explored region in the planar map , to be a simple closed curve , as it is in the simple peeling process .",
    "we call this peeling process _",
    "lazy _ because the determination of the adjacency of a face incident to the frontier is postponed until it is needed in order to perform further exploration .",
    "this means that it is possible , contrary to the simple peeling process , that an attempted peeling step does not lead to a newly explored face .",
    "it turns out that this lazy peeling process is much simpler than the simple peeling process for general weight sequences , and corresponds in fact to a generalization of the original peeling process of watabiki @xcite . as we will see the simplicity manifests itself in the existence of a martingale for the aforementioned random walk associated to the ( lazy ) perimeter process that is nearly universal , meaning that it depends on the weight sequence only through a single parameter @xmath8 $ ] ( which moreover is always @xmath9 in the bipartite case ) .",
    "it is exactly this martingale that can be used to bias the random walk to stay positive .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mapsandpeeling ] we introduce the lazy peeling process on finite pointed planar maps and on infinite maps , and in section [ sec : boltzmannmaps ] we determine its law when applied to pointed @xmath1-boltzmann planar maps .",
    "some of the proofs depend explicitly on miermont s conditions in @xcite for the admissibility of weight sequences .",
    "since they involve different notation and appeal to the bouttier - di  francesco - guitter bijection @xcite , which is not of central importance to the peeling process , we have decided to gather those proofs in appendix [ sec : app ] . in section [ sec : volume ]",
    "we take a brief look at the volume process , while in section [ sec : ibpm ] we derive and prove the law of the perimeter process of the @xmath1-ibpm . in sections",
    "[ sec : scaleperim ] and [ sec : scalevol ] we derive the scaling limits of the perimeter and volume processes on the @xmath1-ibpm for regular critical @xmath1 , thereby reproducing the results of @xcite , section 3 , in the setting of the @xmath1-ibpm .",
    "we finish with some examples in section [ sec : examples ] , showing that the formulation in terms of random walks leads to an efficient way to calculate explicit scaling constants .",
    "a planar map @xmath10 is a connected graph that is properly embedded in the sphere , i.e. without edge crossings , and two such maps are considered identical when they are related by a homeomorphism of the sphere .",
    "the sets of vertices , ( unoriented ) edges , and faces of @xmath10 are denoted by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively .",

    "one should keep in mind that it is possible , with particular peeling algorithms , that a peeling process of an infinite planar map does not explore the full map . for",
    "the random maps discussed below we do expect that the full map is almost surely explored independently of the peeling algorithm .",
    "however , proving this in general goes beyond the scope of this paper ( see @xcite , corollary 7 , for a proof in the case of the `` simple '' peeling process on the uipt ) .",
    "we would like to apply the peeling process introduced in the previous section to a random pointed planar map @xmath71 with fixed root face degree @xmath72 . a quite general probability distribution on @xmath73 ( and on @xmath74 )",
    "is obtained by assigning a weight @xmath75 to @xmath10 given by @xmath76 where the product is over all non - root faces and @xmath77 is a _ weight sequence _ of non - negative real numbers . to avoid degenerate situations we will require that at least one of the @xmath78 s with @xmath79 is positive .",

    "notice that in general @xmath86 .    in order for the weights @xmath87 to give rise to a probability distributions on @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    "we need @xmath88 , which puts a non - trivial restriction on the weight sequence @xmath1 . if @xmath89 for all odd @xmath59 the pointed disk function @xmath81 has support on bipartite planar maps and we call @xmath1 _ bipartite _ , and _ non - bipartite _ otherwise .",
    "it is not hard to see that the only way @xmath81 can vanish is when @xmath1 is bipartite and @xmath72 is odd . as we will see below , apart from this degenerate situation where @xmath90 , the condition that @xmath91 only depends on @xmath1 and not on @xmath72",
    "therefore , it suffices to consider the case @xmath92 , and following @xcite we will call @xmath1 _ admissible _ if @xmath93 . to see why the case @xmath92 is special , notice that there is a natural bijection between pointed planar maps with root face degree @xmath94 ( and more than one face ) and pointed rooted planar map with arbitrary root face degree , corresponding to the operation of gluing the edges of the root face .",
    "hence we may identify @xmath95 which is the _ partition function _ studied in @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will keep the dependence on @xmath1 implicit whenever the considered weight sequence is clear from the context and simply write @xmath96 .",
    "we will also denote by @xmath97 and @xmath98 the generating functions @xmath99 which , as we will see below , converge for @xmath100 large enough .",
