    ", they touch on questions central to the heavy - ion physics program : deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration .    given the potential physics benefits that can be derived from these measurements , rhic physicists have endeavored to extend their abilities to identify hadron types up to higher @xmath0 regions  @xcite .",
    "through these efforts , measurements of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 spectra and @xmath1 which extend beyond @xmath12  gev / c have been presented at this conference . here",

    "the hydrodynamic calculations capture the general features of the data in this region . at much higher @xmath0 it is expected that @xmath1 will be developed via energy loss by fast partons as they traverse the medium created in the collisions .",

    "it is also expected that all hadrons will have similar @xmath1 values where energy loss mechanisms dominate @xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude and particle - type dependence of @xmath1 seen for @xmath15  gev / c suggest that other mechanisms contribute to the developement of @xmath1 up to 67 gev / c .",

    "measurements show that when the @xmath0 spectra of @xmath17-mesons and @xmath18-baryons are characterized with a two component hydrodynamic inspired fit , the temperature and flow velocity parameters extracted are systematically different than those extracted for non - strange hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the differences are consistent with less hadronic rescattering amongst multi - strange hadrons .",
    "for this reason , it is believed that the @xmath1 of multi - strange hadrons reflect collectivity that developed before hadrons formed .    in fig .",

    "theoretical predictions for this value are also shown .",
    "the model that compares best to data is a coalescence model that includes the effect of quark momentum distributions inside the hadron ( _ coalescence + wavefunction _ )  @xcite .",
    "the effect of accounting for the substructure of constituent quarks ( _ higher fock states _ )  @xcite leads to a negative @xmath25 ratio but with a smaller magnitude than observed in the data .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the systematic uncertainties on the measurements have not yet been estimated .",

    "hard processes are expected to scale with @xmath29 , so @xmath30 at high @xmath0 indicates a suppression due to nuclear affects .",
    "models incorporating energy loss of hard scattered partons in medium successfully describe the suppression of hadrons at high @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "indeed , photons which only interact electro - magnetically are found to follow @xmath29 scaling . here , however , we concentrate on the features of the particle - type dependence of hadrons at intermediate @xmath0 .    for @xmath31",
    "gev / c , @xmath26 values are grouped by particle type ( mesons vs. baryons ) .",
    "the larger baryon @xmath26 values indicate that baryon production increases more quickly with centrality than meson production .",
    "this observation is confirmed with good precision for protons and hyperons .",
    "the @xmath17 is a particularly interesting test particle since it is a meson but is more massive than the proton . with good precision , the @xmath17",
    "is now confirmed to follow the systematics of the other mesons .",
    "additionally @xmath27 has been measured for the @xmath9-meson and its values are similar to those of the pions .",
    "particular progress has been made in the measurement of charged pion and proton @xmath26 .",
    "these measurements now extend into the region where fragmentation in vacuum is thought to be the dominate hadronization mechanism . in this region , if the relative fraction of quark and gluon jets ( fragmenting to a hadron with a given @xmath0 ) changes from peripheral to central @xmath4 collisions , the @xmath26 of different particle types may take on different values .",
    "this is a result of the difference in the shapes of the fragmentation functions of quark and gluon jets . within errors",
    "however , the @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 @xmath26 values at @xmath32  gev / c appear to be consistent with each other .",
    "the systematic errors on the proton @xmath26 still , however , allow for significant deviations between proton and pion @xmath26 .",
    "measurement of @xmath8 and @xmath11 @xmath26 at @xmath33  gev indicate that baryon production is also enhanced at lower center - of - mass energies  @xcite : with @xmath11 @xmath26 values well above @xmath29 scaling .",
    "it has been proposed that the large baryon @xmath26 values at rhic may be a result of the suppression of meson production coupled with novel baryon production mechanisms scaling with @xmath29 or @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the lower energy measurements call this interpretation into question since baryon production is still enhanced even while the suppression of mesons is much weaker .",
    "since the grouping of @xmath26 with quark number appears to extend across many hadron species , the centrality dependence of intermediate @xmath0 particle yields may provide information about the quark content of non-@xmath35 candidates . the @xmath36(600 ) , @xmath36(980 ) , @xmath37(980 ) , and @xmath38(800 )",
    "are all candidates for four - quark or @xmath39-molecular states  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath40 decays , which is sensitive to the structure of the @xmath36 , favors the @xmath36 as a four - quark state  @xcite . in fig .",

    "@xmath36(980 ) @xmath26 can be measured from the @xmath41 invariant mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "if at @xmath3  gev / c its value is similar to other mesons , the @xmath36 is either a two quark - state or the baryon enhancement is not a function of the number of quarks : strongly favoring baryon junctions as the source of the baryon enhancement .",
    "the result that @xmath36 @xmath26 is greater than the baryon @xmath26 , will strongly favor @xmath36 as a four - quark or @xmath39-molecular state and coalescence as the dominant hadronization process for intermediate @xmath0 hadrons",
    ". measurements of the @xmath41 invariant mass spectrum should be sensitive to the large difference between these scenarios .",
    "the quark - number scaling of @xmath1 favors the number of constituent - quarks as the relevant quantity in the baryon enhancement . before this scaling was observed , however , the baryon enhancement was seen in the proton - to - pion ratio  @xcite .",
    "[ ratios ] ( left panel ) shows the @xmath42 ratio measured in @xmath43  @xcite , @xmath28  @xcite , and @xmath4  @xcite collisions .",
    "the right panel shows the @xmath44 ratio for @xmath28 , mid - peripheral @xmath4 , and central @xmath4 collisions scaled by 0.5 to fit on the same axis .",
    "the baryon enhancement at intermediate @xmath0 is pronounced in central @xmath4 collisions with @xmath42 reaching a maximum value of nearly 1 at @xmath45  gev / c .",
    "the baryon junction calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite predict that the @xmath0 value where the @xmath46 ratio is at its maximum will increase with collision centrality .",
    "this prediction can be compared to the @xmath47 data .",
    "measurements are still not precise enough , however , to confirm nor disprove this prediction .    fig .",
    "[ ratios ] also demonstrates that the baryon enhancement in @xmath4 collisions may be part of a systematic trend .",
    "baryon production is also enhanced in @xmath48  gev @xmath43 collisions when @xmath49 events are compared to continuum @xmath50 events  @xcite . from those measurements the question arises : _ is the enhancement related to multi - parton topological effects or a difference between quark and gluon fragmentation ? _",
    "since @xmath51 is a purely gluonic process , the observation that the @xmath42 ratio is even larger in @xmath4 collisions indicates that multi - parton topological effects drive the enhancement ( baryon junctions or coalescence ) .",
    "also included in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ratios ] are measurements of the @xmath52 ratio in jets observed in @xmath4 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the analysis triggers on  high @xmath0 \" hadrons ( @xmath53  gev / c ) and measures the proton and pion yields in the peak around the trigger hadron ( near - side ) and the peak opposite the trigger hadron ( away - side ) . because of energy - loss , triggering on high @xmath0 hadrons will select events where a hard scattering occurred near the surface of the @xmath4 collision overlap region . in this case",
    ", one of the fast partons can escape relatively unperturbed while the other fast parton must traverse the bulk matter created in the @xmath4 collision .",
    "the near - side baryon - to - meson ratio then should reflect hadron production outside the matter , while the away - side ratio should reflect hadron production within the matter .",
    "the result @xmath54 is then consistent with the baryon enhancement arising from multi - gluon or multi - quark processes in hadron production .",
    "baryon production may be further favored as a result the recoil that the matter undergoes in response to an impinging hard parton .",
    "[ autocorr ] shows measurements of @xmath0 autocorrelations in 20%30% central , 200 gev , @xmath4 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows the autocorrelations after subtracting sinusoidal modulations associated with @xmath1 .",
    "the remaining features are a positive near - side peak ( associated with an escaping hard parton ) , a negative near - side valley , and a broad , positive , away - side peak .",
    "the right panel shows the same data plotted on a cylinder after the positive near - side peak is subtracted .",
    "the data show that the @xmath0 distribution of hadrons  close in @xmath9 and @xmath17 to an escaping hard parton  is red - shifted .",
    "this apparent recoil can lead to collective motion amongst the matters constituents in the direction of the impinging partons momentum .",
    "this jet - induced flow will lead to an increase in the number of co - moving constituents on the away - side of an escaping hard parton .",
    "the data , in figs .",
    "[ v2 ] , [ rcp ] , and  [ ratios ] show that wherever the density of co - moving constituents is larger , baryon production is enhanced .",
    "now , the near - side and away - side data in  [ ratios ] shows that baryon production is also enhanced in the recoil region of quenched jets .",
    "further information about baryon production can be gleaned from anti - baryon to baryon ratios ( @xmath55 ) . fig .",
    "[ bbarb ] shows @xmath55 for protons ( left panel ) and lambda hyperons ( right panel ) .",
    "the curves show model expectations from ref .",
    "disagreement between the pqcd calculation and the data are evident and indicate the importance of non - perturbative effects in baryon production at @xmath15  gev / c .",
    "the _ soft+quench _ calculation uses a phenomenological treatment of baryon junctions to successfully describe the observed trends . for this calculation",
    ", the apparent baryon enhancement is revealed through the suppression of high-@xmath0 meson production .",
    "it is not clear , however , that this model can successfully describe the @xmath56 , and system - size dependence of the @xmath42 ratio : particularly given that baryon production appears to be enhanced in @xmath57 collisions  @xcite collisions and @xmath58 collisions at @xmath33  gev  @xcite , where little or no high-@xmath0 suppression is seen .",
    "pion , kaon , proton , and hyperon momentum - space distributions have been measured up to @xmath59  gev / c .",
    "several observations indicate that at @xmath60 gev / c , hard processes may dominate particle production . below this",
    ", measurements of the @xmath46 ratios , the @xmath55 ratios , @xmath26 , and @xmath1 indicate that processes beyond the reach of perturbative qcd are prevalent .",
    "measurements favor pictures involving either a large contribution from coalescence processes during hadronization or the presence baryon junctions .",
    "the systematics of the baryon enhancement  including the @xmath56 dependence , the collision system dependence ( particularly @xmath57 ) , and the @xmath46 ratios on the near- and away - side of trigger hadrons  may be a challenge to the baryon junction picture . if the coalescence models are correct , identified particle @xmath1 measurements imply that a highly interacting quark and gluon phase exists in heavy ion collisions prior to hadron formation .",
    "the existance of such a phase is also favored by the large @xmath1 values observed for multiply strange hadrons .",
