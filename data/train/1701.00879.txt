    "multi - objective optimization problems ( mops ) widely exist in computer science such as data mining @xcite , pattern recognition @xcite , image processing @xcite and neural network @xcite , as well as many other application fields  @xcite .",
    "an mop consists of two or more conflicting objectives to be optimized , and there often exist a set of optimal solutions trading off between different objectives .",
    "since the vector evaluated genetic algorithm ( vega ) was proposed by schaffer in 1985 @xcite , a number of multi - objective evolutionary algorithms ( moeas ) have been proposed and shown their superiority in tackling mops during the last three decades .",
    "for example , several moeas based on pareto ranking selection and fitness sharing mechanism including multi - objective genetic algorithm ( moga ) @xcite , non - dominated sorting genetic algorithm ( nsga ) @xcite , and niched pareto genetic algorithm ( npga ) @xcite were proposed in the 1990s . from 1999 to 2002 ,",
    "some moeas characterized by the elitism strategy were developed , such as non - dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii ( nsga - ii ) @xcite , strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 ( spea2 ) @xcite , pareto envelope - based selection algorithm ii ( pesa - ii ) @xcite and cellular multiobjective genetic algorithm ( cellular moga ) @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition ( moea / d ) was proposed in 2007 @xcite , and some other moeas following the basic idea of moea / d had also been developed since then @xcite .    in spite of the large number of moeas in the literature @xcite , there often exist some difficulties in applying and using these algorithms since the source code of most algorithms had not been provided by the authors .",
    "besides , it is also difficult to make benchmark comparisons between moeas due to the lack of a general experimental environment . to address such issues ,",
    "several moea libraries have been proposed @xcite to provide uniform experimental environments for users , which have greatly advanced the multi - objective optimization research and the implementation of new ideas .",
    "for example , the c - based multi - objective optimization library pisa  @xcite separates the implementation into two components , i.e. , the problem - specific part containing mops and operators , and the problem - independent part containing moeas .",
    "these two components are connected by a text file - based interface in pisa .",
    "jmetal @xcite is an object - oriented java - based multi - objective optimization library consisting of various moeas and mops .",
    "moea framework is another free and open source java framework for multi - objective optimization , which provides a comprehensive collection of moeas and tools necessary to rapidly design , develop , execute and test moeas .",
    "otl @xcite , a c++ template library for multi - objective optimization , is characterized by object - oriented architecture , template technique , ready - to - use modules , automatically performed batch experiments and parallel computing . besides , a python - based experimental platform has also been proposed as the supplement of otl , for improving the development efficiency and performing batch experiments more conveniently .     & publication & +   + spea2 @xcite&2001&strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 + psea - ii @xcite&2001&pareto envelope - based selection algorithm ii + nsga - ii @xcite&2002&non - dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii + @xmath0-moea @xcite&2003&multi - objective evolutionary algorithm based on @xmath0-dominance + ibea @xcite&2004&indicator - based evolutionary algorithm + moea / d @xcite&2007&multi - objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition + sms - emoa @xcite&2007&s metric selection evolutionary multi - objective optimization algorithm + msops - ii @xcite&2007&multiple single objective pareto sampling algorithm ii + mts @xcite&2009&multiple trajectory search + age - ii @xcite&2013&approximation - guided evolutionary algorithm ii + nsls @xcite&2015&non - dominated sorting and local search + bce - ibea @xcite&2015&bi - criterion evolution for ibea + & & multi - objective evolutionary algorithm based on an + & & enhanced inverted generational distance metric +   + hype @xcite&2011&hypervolume - based estimation algorithm + picea - g @xcite&2013&preference - inspired coevolutionary algorithm with goals + grea @xcite&2013&grid - based evolutionary algorithm + nsga - iii @xcite&2014&non - dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii + a - nsga - iii @xcite&2014&adaptive nsga - iii + spea2+sde @xcite&2014&spea2 with shift - based density estimation + bige @xcite&2015&bi - goal evolution + efr - rr @xcite&2015&ensemble fitness ranking with ranking restriction + i - dbea @xcite&2015&improved decomposition based evolutionary algorithm + knea @xcite&2015&knee point driven evolutionary algorithm + & & many - objective evolutionary algorithm based on directional + & & diversity and favorable convergence + moea / dd @xcite&2015&multi - objective evolutionary algorithm based on dominance and decomposition + mombi - ii @xcite&2015&many - objective metaheuristic based on the r2 indicator ii + two_arch2 @xcite&2015&two - archive algorithm 2 + & & many - objective evolutionary algorithm based on objective + & & space reduction and diversity improvement + rpea @xcite&2016&reference points - based evolutionary algorithm + rvea @xcite&2016&reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm + rvea * @xcite&2016&rvea embedded with the reference vector regeneration strategy + spea / r @xcite&2016&strength pareto evolutionary algorithm based on reference direction + @xmath1-dea @xcite&2016&@xmath1-dominance based evolutionary algorithm +   + moea / dva @xcite&2016&multi - objective evolutionary algorithm based on decision variable analyses + lmea @xcite&2016&large - scale many - objective evolutionary algorithm +   + g - nsga - ii @xcite&2009&g - dominance based nsga - ii + r - nsga - ii @xcite&2010&r - dominance based nsga - ii + wv - moea - p @xcite&2016&weight vector based multi - objective optimization algorithm with preference +   + gde3 @xcite&2005&generalized differential evolution 3 + moea / d - de @xcite&2009&moea / d based on differential evolution +   + mopso @xcite&2002&multi - objective particle swarm optimization + smpso @xcite&2009&speed - constrained multi - objective particle swarm optimization + dmopso @xcite&2011&decomposition - based particle swarm optimization +     + m - paes @xcite&2000&memetic algorithm based on pareto archived evolution strategy +   + mo - cma @xcite&2007&multi - objective covariance matrix adaptation + rm - meda @xcite&2008&regularity model - based multi - objective estimation of distribution algorithm + im - moea @xcite&2015&inverse modeling multi - objective evolutionary algorithm +   + parego @xcite&2005&efficient global optimization for pareto optimization + sms - ego @xcite&2008&s - metric - selection - based efficient global optimization + k - rvea @xcite&2016&kriging assisted rvea +    [ tab : moea ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : example ]    it can be concluded from the above introduction that the functions provided by platemo are modularized , where two modules ( i.e. , the test module and the experimental module ) are included in the current version of platemo . in the future , we also plan to develop more modules to provide more functions for users .",
    "platemo is an open platform for scientific research and applications of emo , hence it allows users to add their own moeas , mops , operators and performance indicators to it , where users should save the new moea , mop , operator or performance indicator to be added as a matlab function ( i.e. , a _ .m _ file ) with the specified interface and form , and put it in the corresponding folder . in the following , the methods of extending platemo with a new moea , mop , operator and performance indicator are illustrated by several cases , respectively .",

    "global.initialization_ ( ) , and the non - dominated front number and the crowding distance of each individual are calculated ( line 24 ) . in each generation , the function _ global.nottermination_ ( ) is invoked to check whether the termination criterion is fulfilled , and the variable _ population _ is passed to this function to be the final output ( line 5 ) .",
    "afterwards , the mating pool selection , generating offsprings , and environmental selection are performed in sequence ( line 69 ) .",
    "the common code required by any moea is underlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : code1 ] .",
    "in addition to the interface of the function , one moea needs to perform at least the following three operations : obtaining an initial population via _ global.initialization_ ( ) , checking the optimization state and outputting the final population via _",

    "<S> over the last three decades , a large number of evolutionary algorithms have been developed for solving multi - objective optimization problems . </S>",
    "<S> however , there lacks an up - to - date and comprehensive software platform for researchers to properly benchmark existing algorithms and for practitioners to apply selected algorithms to solve their real - world problems . </S>",
    "<S> the demand of such a common tool becomes even more urgent , when the source code of many proposed algorithms has not been made publicly available . to address these issues , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a matlab platform for evolutionary multi - objective optimization in this paper , called platemo , which includes more than 50 multi - objective evolutionary algorithms and more than 100 multi - objective test problems , along with several widely used performance indicators . with a user - friendly graphical user interface </S>",
    "<S> , platemo enables users to easily compare several evolutionary algorithms at one time and collect statistical results in excel or latex files . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , platemo is completely open source , such that users are able to develop new algorithms on the basis of it . </S>",
    "<S> this paper introduces the main features of platemo and illustrates how to use it for performing comparative experiments , embedding new algorithms , creating new test problems , and developing performance indicators . </S>",
