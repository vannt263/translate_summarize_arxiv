    "a previous attempt to derive light - wimp limits by the xenon100 collaboration @xcite was received with criticism @xcite pointing out the unphysical behavior of the quenching factor in the production of direct scintillation by nuclear recoils ( @xmath2 ) employed . an additional critique",
    "@xcite emphasized traceable mistakes made in the data analysis of previous @xmath2 measurements performed by the xenon10 and xenon100 collaborations .",
    "a new recent @xmath2 measurement by the xenon100 collaboration ( plante _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) addresses the concerns in @xcite , specifically the systematic effect introduced by erroneously normalizing simulated recoil rates to their corresponding measured values , and the sub - optimal design of several earlier calibration detectors , prone to multiple scattering involving inert materials .",
    "the new detector used in @xcite features a compact design that bypasses this concern and maximizes light collection from the active liquid xenon ( lxe ) volume .",
    "not surprisingly , the monotonically decreasing behavior of @xmath2 towards zero energy predicted in @xcite is now observed by plante _",
    "et al . _",
    "while great strides towards a better understanding of @xmath2 have been made in @xcite , significant room for improvement remains :    @xmath3=0.em    an unnecessary degree of freedom in the fits comparing lxe scintillation measurements and simulations has been introduced by plante _",
    "et al . _ , namely the energy resolution as a function of recoil energy , which is a predictable quantity , and not independent of @xmath2 , as implicitly postulated in @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to an earlier measurement by manzur _",
    "@xcite , also correctly pointing at a decreasing @xmath2 , where the resolution was determined by measurements at energies well - above any threshold effects , and for all lower energies unambiguously defined according to its expected dependence on photoelectron yield ( a function of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the introduction of this gratuitous degree of freedom can reinstate the deleterious effects described in @xcite , by substantially biasing @xmath2 towards artificially large values and reducing uncertainty .",
    "this concern is particularly important below @xmath46.5 kev@xmath5 , where threshold effects become dominant in @xcite .",
    "the approach taken in @xcite does not necessarily have to constitute an issue , as long as the obtained best - fit resolution follows the expected behavior@xmath6 .",
    "no mention of this comparison is made in @xcite .",
    "as described in sec .",
    "ii below , the extrapolated behavior of @xmath2 to zero energy critically determines lxe sensitivity to light - wimps , making attention to such details very important . a discussion of this comparison between expected and best - fit energy resolution would considerably improve the credibility of the lowest - energy @xmath2 values obtained by plante _",
    "et al._.    measurements in @xcite were performed in single - phase mode , i.e. , in the absence of the electric drift field present during the operation of the xenon100 detector .",
    "this field is expected to suppress electron - ion recombination , reducing the scintillation yield . while this effect was found to be small by manzur _",
    "@xcite , the @xmath2 values by plante _",
    "_ should be considered an upper limit to the actual nuclear recoil scintillation yield in the xenon100 detector .",
    "this consideration as an upper limit is revisited in sec .",
    "ii within a different ( instrumental ) context .",
    "it must be kept in mind that the definition of @xmath2 used by the lxe detector community differs from the traditional one for a quenching factor , by relativizing the scintillation yield from low - energy nuclear recoils to that from electron recoils at a relatively high ionization energy ( 122 kev ) .",
    "the more conventional definition uses the ratio of scintillation yield from nuclear and electron recoils of identical energy .",
    "this may seem like a moot point , until the large non - proportionality typically observed in heavy scintillators @xcite , including lxe @xcite , is examined : a large increase in scintillation yield for electron recoils ( the denominator in the traditional definition of quenching factor ) is typically observed below few hundred of kev down to few kev .",
    "compton scattering measurements complementary to those in @xcite are clearly advisable .",
    "the analysis of a 100 day exposure from the xenon100 detector @xcite has resulted in a claim of sizeable improvement in light - wimp sensitivity with respect to a previous shorter ( 11 day ) run @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the strong assumptions implicitly made to arrive to this conclusion and of the uncertainties neglected in @xcite is provided below .     by plante _",

    "@xcite , and dash - dotted ( red ) to a most recent monte carlo - independent @xmath2 determination by zeplin - iii @xcite .",

    "1 is similar to the exclusion curve in @xcite .",
    "it is obtained by assuming the logarithmic extrapolation of the @xmath2 from plante _ et al .",
    "_ , as proposed in @xcite , and that only the lowest in energy of the three accepted nuclear - recoil events in @xcite could be due to a light - wimp .",
    "contour `` b '' in the same curve represents the exclusion obtained when the 2@xmath7 c.l .",
    "uncertainty band in this @xmath2 is adopted instead .",
    "the resulting change in sensitivity is much larger than what is indicated by the very narrow uncertainty bands in fig .  5 of @xcite .",
    "this issue can be confirmed by performing a self - consistency test between the xenon100 exclusion curves in @xcite and @xcite : the two values of @xmath2 contemplated in @xcite ( fig",
    ".  1 there ) generated exclusion curves diverging by a very large factor for light wimp masses ( fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "those two values of @xmath2 are coincidentally not very different from the central and 2@xmath7 c.l . boundaries of the @xmath2 from plante _ et al . _",
    "( fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite , the new xenon100 analysis assigns an insignificant impact on the exclusions to this large spread in @xmath2 . the origin for this lack of self - consistency must be addressed@xmath1 .",
    "in a departure from the blind analysis initially intended by the xenon100 collaboration , three events next to threshold were rejected immediately following unblinding @xcite .",
    "these events have been ascribed to photomultiplier ( pmt ) noise affecting the s1 ( direct scintillation ) channel .",
    "post - unblinding corrective actions are often required and no judgment on this decision should be passed until more details become available . however , it is worth remembering that this type of pmt noise was already present in xenon10 data @xcite ( and not rejected a posteriori ) and is also ubiquitous in a xenon100 example event catalogued as `` good '' @xcite , indicating that data cuts originally deemed as adequate must have been in place against it@xmath8 .",
    "details about the post - unblinding criteria developed to reject these events while in the presence of robust s2 ( ionization ) signals will be of special interest .",
    "contours labelled `` c '' , `` d '' and `` h '' in fig .",
    "1 display the non - negligible effect of including these three rejected events into the calculation of xenon100 exclusions .    dashed lines in fig .",
    "1 represent xenon100 exclusions using a logarithmic extrapolation of the alternative @xmath2 obtained by manzur _",
    ". _ @xcite using another optimally - designed lxe chamber .",
    "differences in data treatment and mode of operation between @xcite and @xcite are described above .",
    "criticisms concerning the data treatment in @xcite are given in @xcite .",
    "contours labelled `` g '' and `` h '' use the logarithmic extrapolation of the lower 1@xmath7 c.l .",
    "boundary rather than the central @xmath2 value ( contours `` e '' and `` f '' ) .",
    "a lingering critical question is to what extent a determination of @xmath2 performed using highly - optimized compact calibration detectors like those in @xcite can be applied with confidence to a much larger device like the xenon100 detector , featuring a small s1 light - detection efficiency ( just @xmath46% @xcite ) , different hardware trigger configuration , data processing , etc .",
    "for instance , simulations like those used within xenon100 to obtain a cumulative cut acceptance near threshold can only be regarded as best - effort estimates .",
    "their limited meaning and tendency to significantly overestimate near - threshold efficiency has been recently encountered by plante _",
    "@xcite , even for the near - ideal conditions of their small calibration chamber ( @xmath418 c.c . of lxe , with 4@xmath9 pmt coverage ) .",
    "another example of instrumental constraints is the negligibly small low - energy _ effective _ @xmath2 derived by the 12 kg zeplin lxe dark matter detector @xcite when its measurement is attempted _ in situ _",
    "( if adopted , this @xmath2 generates essentially no lxe sensitivity to wimp masses below 10 gev / c@xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "going back some time , a dramatic deficit in observed neutron - induced recoil rates compared to few - kev@xmath5 expectations was observed with the xenon10 detector @xcite .",
    "such comparisons should be revisited within the context of the existing xenon100 neutron calibrations : if the expected response to few - kev@xmath5 recoils is still absent due to instrumental limitations , light - wimp limits should not be distilled from sheer wishful thinking . as discussed next ,",
    "light - wimp limits are obtained by xenon100 under the strong assumption of positive poissonian fluctuations in scintillation light from wimp - induced recoils well - below the detector energy threshold .",
    "the agreement between expected and observed neutron - induced recoil rates should therefore be demonstrated into that energy range .",
    "the xenon100 collaboration is invited to produce this much needed validation of their claims@xmath10 .",
    "the mentioned assumption of poissonian statistics governing the microscopic processes@xmath11 of light and charge generation by few kev@xmath5 nuclear recoils in lxe is not only presently unwarranted @xcite , but seemingly counter to the scarce available experimental information : the very small value of the fano factor in lxe is for instance indicative of sub - poissonian statistics ruling those processes @xcite .",
    "similarly , the electron emission statistics by few - kev , heavy - mass ions during surface collisions is known to be better described by binomial rather than poissonian statistics @xcite .",
    "contours `` d '' , `` f '' and `` h '' in fig .  1 display the effect of a small deviation from the poisson assumption ( a binomial distribution of same mean , taking a probability of s1 photon detection of 6% @xcite ) .",
    "these contours should be considered as illustrative ansatzes for information - carrier statistics that could generate even less light production . in this respect ,",
    "it is worth emphasizing that a 7 gev / c@xmath1 light - wimp is expected to impart a mean recoil energy in lxe of just @xmath40.6 kev@xmath5 , with an absolute maximum ( occurring with infinitesimal probability ) of @xmath44.1 kev@xmath5 . at this very endpoint ,",
    "the probability of surpassing the xenon100 four - photoelectron ( @xmath48.5 kev@xmath5 ) threshold is never larger than @xmath410% , even when the logarithmic extrapolation of the @xmath2 by plante _",
    "et al . _ and",
    "poisson fluctuations are adopted .",
    "not all light - wimp detecting media fare as poorly from this point of view of generation of information carriers : the same 7 gev / c@xmath1 wimp at its spectral endpoint ( @xmath41.4 kev ionization ) in cogent germanium diodes would generate a readily detectable @xmath4470 electron - hole pairs .",
    "1 includes the present uncertainty in the quenching factor for sodium recoils in dama / libra @xcite , a subject of discussion avoided by the xenon100 collaboration in @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty extends the dama / libra region to considerably lower wimp masses than what is represented in @xcite .",
    "a recent reanalysis of xenon10 data uses strictly the ionization channel in that detector to impose limits on light - mass wimps @xcite .",
    "this s2 light emitted via electroluminescence from charge drifted into the gas phase of the device is , when examined alone , sufficient to extend the sensitivity of lxe detectors to recoils of o(1 ) kev@xmath5 .",
    "not including the information from s1 ( direct scintillation ) allows a reduction in threshold at the expense of losing the ability to distinguish nuclear from electron recoils .",
    "while this approach is promising , the few kev@xmath5 nuclear recoil energy scale corresponding to this s2 channel is presently hopelessly ill - defined .",
    "this is a result of the inadequate `` best - fit monte carlo '' method @xcite employed to arrive at it .",
    "an extensive critique of this method , ignored thus far by xenon10 authors , can be found in @xcite . in a troubling case of double - standards ,",
    "the gist of this critique ( that with this method all uncertainties are absorbed into the energy scale ) has been recently echoed by the xenon100 collaboration ( sec .",
    "i in @xcite ) , when rebuking indirect measurements of @xmath2 using the same methodology .    in lieu of a reiteration of the criticisms in @xcite ,",
    "the reader is invited to inspect fig .  2 :",
    "each of the colored energy scales shown there , generated by the `` best - fit monte carlo '' method , has been claimed to be the correct one by the xenon10 collaboration over the brief span of the last two years .",
    "the scale is observed to change as rapidly as from workshop presentation to its published proceedings .",
    "its monotonic evolution has been towards the black curves , held in @xcite to correspond to the most plausible energy scale ( one derived from an earlier method laid out by xenon10 authors : see pertinent discussion in @xcite ) . a critically - minded reader would ( rightly ) argue that none of these can be presently assigned any credibility at few kev@xmath5 .",
    "however , reasons have been provided in @xcite to support the solid black curve , representing the lindhard theory modified below a @xmath440 kev@xmath5 kinematic threshold @xcite by an example of adiabatic correction , as in @xcite :    @xmath3=0.em    this energy scale generates a similar quenching for the ionization yield and the @xmath2 observed by plante _",
    "et al . _ or manzur _ et al . _ ,",
    "i.e. , a monotonic decrease in the generation of information carriers ( free charge , direct scintillation photons ) below kinematic threshold @xcite , having an effective cutoff at @xmath41 kev@xmath5 . that both processes should decrease hand - in - hand",
    "can be argued based on the dominant role of ionization as the main precursor to direct scintillation for low energy recoils in lxe @xcite .",
    "the energy scales postulated thus far by xenon10 ( color curves in fig .",
    "2 ) overestimate , by several orders of magnitude , the very small average charge yields observed in impact ionization experiments involving few kev and sub - kev xenon ions .",
    "the relevance of these measurements and examples from the literature are discussed in @xcite , where it is also emphasized that xenon10 workers are not without a reference on what to expect at these low energies .",
    "the introduction of the adiabatic correction proposed in @xcite resolves this disagreement .",
    "contour in @xcite , as per @xcite ; dashed blue @xcite .",
    "dark lines correspond to the predicted energy scales in @xcite ( see text ) .",
    "inset : alternative analysis of the few - electron s2 background in xenon10 @xcite ( see text ) . ,",
    "width=283 ]    of special interest is a population of xenon10 low energy ionization signals described in @xcite as single electrons@xmath12 .",
    "this definition is both surprising and misleading . as mentioned in @xcite , the large amplification gain provided by the electroluminescence provides a good resolution in the multiplicity of drifted charge in lxe .",
    "these events clearly include a multi - electron component and their population has been described as such by the contact author of @xcite , as recently as in @xcite .",
    "their origin is unknown , and hard to ascribe to minimum ionizing particles in an efficient self - shielding medium such as lxe @xcite . while none of this is discussed in @xcite , their accumulation towards low values of s2 pulse - width is to be expected from the effect of charge multiplicity on this variable , and does not have to correspond to a radioactive contamination close to the @xmath13 detector coordinate ( this is unlikely , given that roughly the same number of pmts , major sources of internal activity in the xenon10 detector , are placed at both extrema of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the inset in fig .  2 represents the differential rate of few - electron s2 events in xenon10 , obtained by applying the same five background cuts as in @xcite , extending the analysis down to the s2 = 1e@xmath15 boundary , and adopting the energy scale described by the black solid line in the same figure .",
    "this differential rate seems to be also compatible with fig .  2 in @xcite , once the adopted energy scale is included .",
    "it offers a good match to the expected signal from a light wimp in the region of interest of other searches ( dama / libra , cogent , cresst ) .",
    "the outcome of this exercise , performed here strictly for the sake of argument , should be strongly de - emphasized at this time , given the present lack of knowledge about this energy scale evidenced in fig .  2",
    ". the reader should remember instead that a further evolution by a mere @xmath41 kev@xmath5 in the ever - changing s2 energy scales postulated by xenon10 can transform the  severe constraints \" of @xcite into a signal in principle compatible with a light - wimp .    in conclusion ,",
    "the claims in @xcite are clearly presently untenable .",
    "awaiting clarification of the several pending issues pointed out in sec .",
    "i and ii , light - wimp limits obtained through a more conventional analysis of xenon100 data @xcite can only be assigned the very limited meaning illustrated by fig .  1 .",
    "the xenon100 collaboration is congratulated for the recent advancement in their understanding of @xmath2 , encouraged to develop improved methods of characterization of the s2 energy scale leading to a reliable exploration of light - wimp candidates , and urged to employ transparency in the discussion of uncertainties and assumptions underlaying their results , in view of the very limited performance of lxe as a light - wimp detection medium . finally , while several interesting phenomenological routes to alleviate tension between lxe constraints and other light - wimp searches have been put forward recently @xcite",
    ", these deviations from arguably more conventional assumptions do not seem to be mandatory at this time .",
    "a new measurement of @xmath2 by the zeplin - iii collaboration appeared coincident with the release of this preprint @xcite .",
    "fig .  1 now reflects xenon100 exclusions obtained with it .",
    "zeplin - iii derives a @xmath2 decreasing below 40 kev@xmath5 and vanishing at few kev@xmath5 , in tight agreement with the lxe kinematic threshold described in @xcite .",
