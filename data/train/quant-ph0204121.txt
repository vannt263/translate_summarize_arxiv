    "von neumann s quantum theory of measurement emphasizes that , after a measurement , the emergence of classicality of a quantum system @xmath0 from quantum dynamics is due to a perfect correlation between this system and its measuring apparatus @xmath1 described by quantum mechanics [ 1 ] .",
    "but w.h . zurek argued that this theory does not thoroughly solve the core problem in quantum measurement [ 2 ] .",
    "his argument is , the interaction between the quantum system and the apparatus can only produce a quantum entanglement like the epr state with quantum uncertainty [ 3 ] , rather than a classical correlation described by a statistical operator with classical probability distribution @xmath2- the density matrix @xmath3 @xmath4 and@xmath5 are orthonormal basis vectors of the system to be measured and the pointer state of the apparatus respectively . to go beyond von neumann s theory , zurek proposed an elegant triple model  for quantum measurement twenty years ago . in his theory , besides the quantum system and the apparatus , an environment @xmath6 must be introduced as a necessary element to generate the triple entanglement    @xmath7    through the coupling of the apparatus to the environment .",
    "it is obvious that the classical mixture state @xmath8 of correlation can be obtained by ignoring ( mathematically  tracing over  ) the environment states .",
    "zurek s triple model in principle overcomes the key difficulty in quantum measurement theory , but it still needs microscopic refinement in terms of quantum dynamics and there remain details to be filled in . actually ,",
    "just as zurek points out , to implement such triple entanglement as dynamic schmidt decomposition , the interactions among the triple parts should be time dependent . to be more precise",
    ", two steps are required to finish the measurement : turning on the interaction @xmath9 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the instant @xmath10 and turning on the interaction @xmath11 between @xmath1 and @xmath6 at another instant @xmath12 .",
    "the process can be represented as follows : @xmath13    however , the time dependence of hamiltonian means that there exists another extra system governing the  universe  formed by the triple system .",
    "so the quantum dynamic theory describing the measurement is not in a close form .",
    "moreover , to realize a real measurement process , one should switch the couplings at certain exact instants . in practice , it is difficult to exactly control the interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath6 so that it occurs only after the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 has just been established .",
    "another point we wish to mention is that according to zurek s model , to produce an ideal triple entanglement such that @xmath14and @xmath15form three orthonormal sets , it is even required that there is no interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath6 as described in eq.(1 ) ; otherwise the schmidt decomposition structure of eq.(1 ) would be destroyed .",
    "most recently , we study the phenomenon of quantum decoherence of a macroscopic object along a different direction : we investigate the adiabatic quantum entanglement [ 4 ] between its collective states ( such as that of the center - of - mass ( c.m ) ) and its inner states .",
    "it is shown that the adiabatic wave function of a macroscopic object can be written as an entangled state with correlation between adiabatic inner states and quasi - classical motion configurations of the c.m .",
    "since the adiabatic inner states are factorized with respect to the composing parts of the macroscopic object [ 5 ] , this adiabatic separation can induce quantum decoherence .",
    "this observation thus provides us with a possible solution to the schroedinger cat paradox .",
    "this approach to quantum decoherence only concerns a double system rather than a triple one , so it does not solve the quantum measurement problem completely . rather , it provides a novel example for von neumann s quantum measurement theory , which does not produce a classical correlation .    in this paper , integrating the above mentioned results with zurek s triple model , we present a consistent quantum -mechanical approach for measurement process in a close form with time - independent total hamiltonian . in this alternative , the measuring apparatus is taken as a macroscopic object with effective inner variables and a pointer variable .",
    "the novel point in our treatment lies in the complete separation of the pointer variable from the effective inner variables of the macroscopic apparatus @xmath1 . with this separation",
    "there is no coupling between the pointer variable and the inner variables of @xmath16but the effective interaction of the pointer with @xmath0 is induced by that of the original variables of @xmath1 in an adequate way .",
    "just for this reason , the triple entanglement [ 2 ] can be dynamically generated without the time - dependent control .",
    "to sketch our basic idea , we start with an exactly solvable model in the intracavity dynamics . using this example",
    "we also show that the back action of the inner environment on the system plus pointer implied by heisenberg s position - momentum uncertainty relation will disturb the phases of states between the system and pointer and then decohers the quantum entanglement system plus pointer , which is formed dynamically just before measurement .",
    "the quantum theory of measurement based on von neumann s theory usually treats the measuring process as a quantum mechanical evolution by considering the measuring apparatus @xmath1 as a proper quantum system .",
    "this is just in contrast to the copenhagen interpretation with the hypothesis of classicality on the part of the apparatus .",
    "according to the theory of copenhagen school the apparatus should behave classically so that the experimental outcome of measurement can be recorded in the classical way .",
    "zurek s theory does not stress the classicality of apparatus directly since the meaning of classicality of apparatus is not clear without association with the measured system @xmath0 .",
    "the important discovery by zurek is the decoherence of the quantum entanglement between the measuring apparatus and the measured system induced by an external or inner environment @xmath6 .",
    "led by zurek s observation one may imagine that , it is the direct interaction of environment with the pointer of apparatus that leads to the classicality of apparatus .",
    "however , it is not true !    in the following , we can show that , to decoher the quantum entanglement between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , there only need two proper couplings of the measured system to the pointer and to the environment , and the interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath6 is not necessary .",
    "the requirement of  no interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath6  will result in a time -independent re - formulation of zurek s triple theory . in our quantum approach of measurement by generalizing zurek s triple theory , we consider @xmath6 as the collection of the internal relative degrees of freedom .",
    "then , the pointer ( also denoted by @xmath17 of the apparatus can be defined as the collective ( or macroscopic ) degree of freedom of the apparatus , e.g. , the coordinate of the center of mass ( c.m ) .    in general",
    "we write a time - independent total hamiltonian as @xmath18 here , @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the free hamiltonian for @xmath23 and @xmath6 . ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 roughly stand for the system variable , the pointer variable and the environment variable correspondingly ; @xmath26 @xmath27 describes the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 while @xmath28 describes that between @xmath0 and @xmath6 .    to gain a close form for quantum measurement based on zurek s triple theory , it is important that no interaction exists between the pointer @xmath1 and the  inner  environmental  @xmath6 ( in fig.1 ) . only by assuming that the system satisfies the following double non - demolition condition : @xmath29=0,[h_s , v_{se}]=0\\ ] ] the evolution operator for the total system can be written as    @xmath30    here , \\{@xmath31 } is an eigenvector of @xmath32 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath33 , @xmath34\\left| n\\right\\rangle _ s\\ ] ] and @xmath35\\left| n\\right\\rangle _ s\\ ] ] are the effective evolution operators .",
    "they describe the feedbacks of the measured system on the pointer of apparatus and the environment respectively when @xmath0 is just in its eigen - state @xmath36    , the pointer @xmath1 and the inner environment @xmath6,width=377,height=264 ]    it is worthy to point out that , in the present approach for entanglement , the energy of the measured system is conserved while the quantum coherence is destroyed .",
    "this kind of unitary evolution operator @xmath37 can establish a non - separable correlation among the system , the pointer and the environment .",
    "namely , if the initial state @xmath38 of the total system is of a factorized form with the system state @xmath39 @xmath40 , the pointer state @xmath41 and the environment state @xmath42 , then the final state of the total system will be    @xmath43    here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the final states of the pointer and the environment entangling with the system states @xmath46 thus , a triple correlation among the measured system , the pointer and the environment is established .",
    "obviously , the reduced density matrix for the composite subsystem formed by the system plus the pointer is @xmath47 the off - diagonal terms on the r.h.s of this equation is responsible for the interference pattern .",
    "it is easy to see that the interference fringe completely vanishes when the states of the inner part @xmath6 are orthogonal to one another . in this situation , an ideal zurek@xmath48s classical correlation @xmath49 results from the ideal entanglement with the correlated components latexmath:[$%     the above zurek@xmath48s classical correlation [ 2 ] just describes the fact like weather forecast impersonally predicting whether it rains or not tomorrow .",
    "the equation ( 7 ) deterministically tells us the classical correlation that the system is in @xmath51 when the pointer is just in @xmath52 with probability @xmath53 this is unlike the quantum entanglement @xmath54 that not only indicates the correlation between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , but also simultaneously tells us the correlation with probability @xmath57 between any superposition state @xmath58 of @xmath0 and the corresponding one @xmath59 of @xmath1 .",
    "this is because @xmath60 can also be re - expressed as @xmath61 in fact , the classical correlation does not say anything about the correlation of different pairs @xmath62 and @xmath63 but for the original pair @xmath64 and @xmath52 , and its prediction is independent of what to be measured . on the contrary ,",
    "what the quantum entanglement tells us depends on what we measure according to epr argument [ 3 ] . with this understanding",
    ", it can be said that quantum measurement is implemented completely when quantum decoherence happens to result in the so called classical correlation .",
    "the above argument shows that the vanishing overlap of the final states of the inner environment is necessary to obtain the classical correlation after measurement.we define this overlap @xmath65 as decoherence factor .",
    "now an immediately - following question is in what case the decoherence factor becomes zero .",
    "our previous works on quantum measurement theory [ 5 ] showed that an ideal entanglement appears in the macroscopic limit that the number @xmath66 of particles making up the detector approaches infinity . in the present case , we assume there are @xmath66 degrees of freedom in the apparatus .",
    "we can peel off one ( or more ) collective variable as the pointer of the apparatus , and the inner environment is formed by @xmath66 relative internal variables @xmath67 .",
    "we can imagine that there are @xmath68 blocks constituting the inner environment , so we may write @xmath69 and @xmath70 in sum forms .",
    "if all @xmath71 commute with one another , we can factorize the effective evolution operator @xmath72 : @xmath73}\\ ] ] when the measured system is initially prepared in @xmath64 and the environment in a factorized state @xmath74}\\rangle , $ ] the environment will obey a factorized evolution @xmath75}\\rangle \\equiv \\prod_{j=1}^n|e_n^{[j]}\\rangle = \\prod_{j=1}^nu_{en}^{[j]}|e^{[j]}\\rangle q\\ ] ] entangling with the system state @xmath76 it results in the  factorization structure [ 5 ] of decoherence factor    @xmath77}|e_n^{[j]}\\rangle .\\ ] ]    since each factor @xmath78}|e_n^{[j]}\\rangle $ ] in @xmath79 has a norm less than unity , the product of infinite such factors may approach zero .",
    "this investigation was developed based on the hepp - coleman model and its generalizations [ 12,13 ] and was applied to analyzing the universality of the influence of environment on quantum computing process [ 14 ] .",
    "in this section and the subsequent sections , we will use an exactly - solvable model based on the over - simplified intracavity system to demonstrate our central ideas .    consider a cavity with two end mirrors ( as in fig.2 ) ,",
    "one of which is fixed while the other is treated as a macroscopic object consisting of @xmath66 particles of mass @xmath80 with position coordinate @xmath81 and momentum coordinate @xmath82(@xmath83 ) .",
    "the radiation pressure of the cavity field on the moving mirror is proportional to the intracavity photon density .",
    "let @xmath84 and @xmath85 be the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity with a single mode of frequency @xmath86 .",
    "the cavity - mirror coupling is described by an interaction hamiltonian @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath85 where @xmath89 is coupling constant depending on the electric dipole .",
    "free particles _ ,",
    "width=377,height=264 ]    in this situation we describe the cavity field dynamics with the free hamiltonian @xmath90 @xmath85 .",
    "this cavity field -mirror coupling system can also be used to detect the photon number in the cavity by the motion of the mirror .",
    "obviously , the total hamiltonian governing the motion of the mirror is @xmath91 by taking the moving mirror as a whole , this intracavity model is associated with the interferometric detection of the gravitational wave [ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "this system has already been studied quite extensively by many authors [ 8 ] , under the assumption that the moving mirror is a macrocosm without internal structure .",
    "like the discussions in these previous references [ 6 - 8 ] , we also assume the oscillation of the movable mirror is so small that the the frequency of single cavity mode does not undergo a considerable change due to the displacement of the mirror .",
    "the above described physical system can be viewed as a quantum measurement system , in which the cavity field monitored by the macroscopic moving mirror is to be measured . since @xmath92=0 $ ] and @xmath93=0 $ ] , the moving mirror has no influence on the cavity field . on the other hand , different eigen - states @xmath51 of @xmath32 can imprint on the moving mirror differently .",
    "indeed , the interaction term @xmath94 implies that different forces will act on the moving mirror when the cavity is prepared in different number states @xmath95 we notice that this is a typical characteristic of non - demolition measurement [ 9 ] .",
    "we take the cm position @xmath96 to be the pointer of the apparatus - the moving mirror and the relative coordinates @xmath97 @xmath98 to be the internal variables . here , @xmath99 is the total mass of the moving mirror .",
    "we denote the conjugate momenta of @xmath100 and @xmath101 by @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "then , we obtain an interesting realization of zurek s triple model with the time - independent hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the free hamiltonians for the pointer part and the internal environment respectively , @xmath106 is the effective interaction describing the coupling of the system to the pointer and @xmath107 describes an interaction between the system and the internal environment . here , @xmath108 are the effective coupling constants , and the mass matrix @xmath109 is defined by the matrix elements @xmath110 this expression of @xmath109 is obtained by substituting the individual laboratory coordinate @xmath111\\ ] ] into the interaction term @xmath112 of the total system hamiltonian .    in this model the couplings of the system to the pointer and to the environment can be turned - on or turned -off simultaneously for @xmath113 and @xmath114 are proportional to the same coupling constant .",
    "physically this is reasonable as the pointer variable is a reflection of the collective average effect of the internal degrees of freedom of the macroscopic apparatus .",
    "another remarkable character of the above model is the absence of coupling between the pointer variable and the inner variables of @xmath115 physically this is just what is required of an ideal measuring apparatus , whose effective inner motion should not directly affect the reading of the pointer .",
    "in fact this property guarantees that a triple entanglement will form dynamically from a factorized initial state .",
    "this just realizes our central ideas in section 2 : the de - coupling of pointer variable with the inner ones in the apparatus and the factorization of the inner environment with respect to each inner variable .",
    "now let us consider the exact solution to the dynamic evolution problem of the intracavity model introduced in section ii .",
    "to this end we invoke a canonical transformation @xmath116 from the inner variables @xmath101 to a new set of canonical variables @xmath117 here , @xmath118 is an ( @xmath119 by ( @xmath119 matrix diagonalizing the mass matrix @xmath109 , i.e. @xmath120 is diagonal .",
    "denote the conjugate momenta of @xmath100 and @xmath121 by @xmath102and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "the inner environment is described by the new internal variable @xmath122 .",
    "then , the total hamiltonian can be re - expressed as @xmath123 where the eigenvalues @xmath124 of matrix @xmath109 are the effective mass with respect to the new coordinates @xmath125 @xmath126 represent the strengths of forces on each inner coordinate @xmath121 by one photon of cavity field .",
    "obviously , the inner motion of the moving mirror is factorizable since the effective hamiltonian @xmath127 is only a simple sum of the single component @xmath128 this direct sum structure results in the factorization of the effective evolution matrix defined by @xmath129 \\\\ & = & e^{-i\\frac{tp_i^2}{2m_i^{^{\\prime } } } } e^{i\\frac{nf_it^2p_i}{% 2m_i^{^{\\prime } } } } \\exp [ inf_it\\eta _ i - i\\frac{n^2f_i^2t^3}{6m_i^{^{\\prime } } } % ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the fock state and @xmath130 is the evolution matrix of the total system . here",
    ", we have used the wei - norman algebraic method [ 10 ] to re - write the single particle evolution matrix .    without loss of generality , we assume each inner component of the moving mirror to be described by the same gaussian wave packet @xmath131 of width @xmath132 i.e. @xmath133 this is a physically reasonable preparation of initial state .",
    "this is because the initial state of the inner @xmath134 also defines the factorized gaussian wave packet @xmath135 in @xmath136- representation since @xmath137 is a canonical invariant , i.e. , @xmath138 a gaussian wave packet @xmath139 $ ] implies basically that the particles composing the moving mirror are almost peaked on the position of c.m .",
    "we also assume that the c.m of the moving mirror is just in the position eigenstate @xmath140 and the cavity is initially in a coherent state @xmath141 where @xmath142 . in this case using the effective evolution matrix of the pointer @xmath143)t]\\ ] ] with respect to the cavity fock state @xmath64 , we explicitly obtain the triple entanglement @xmath144 at any instance @xmath145 . here , @xmath146 and @xmath147",

    ".     plotted as a function of time and for various values of the particle number @xmath66 .",
    "we have taken the mass of a particle @xmath158 kg , the wave width of the gaussian wave packet as the length of the cavity @xmath159 m and the force strength on each inner coordinate @xmath160kgms@xmath161 . the real particle number @xmath162 . , width=377,height=264 ]    in the macroscopic limit @xmath163 or for the long time evolution @xmath164 the vanishing decoherence factors @xmath165 leads to an ideal triple entanglement ( 1 ) with invariant probability distribution @xmath166 .",
    "finally we need to show the measuring process we modelled above is ideal since the pointer states entangling with each system state are orthogonal to one another , namely , @xmath167 @xmath168 for @xmath169 .in fact , in the coordinate - representation , the pointer state @xmath170 can be calculated explicitly as @xmath171 ^2}{8mt}+\\left ( ngtx-\\frac{n^2g^2t^3}{6m}% \\right ) \\right\\ } ] \\ ] ] this means that the width of each wave packet @xmath172 is zero and then the overlaps @xmath173 of wave packets vanish for @xmath169 .",
    "this indicates an ideal classical correlation between the measured system and the pointer of apparatus in our intracavity model .",
    "therefore , our triple model for quantum measurement leads to an ideal quantum measurement in a purely quantum dynamical way with neither the introduction of the hypothesis of classicality for the apparatus , nor the artificial control of interactions .",
    "as shown above , an ideal entanglement of the double system ( formed by the measured system plus pointer of apparatus ) with an ( inner ) environment is a necessary element to force the apparatus to behave so classically that a de - entanglement process occurs in the double system .",
    "another necessary element to implement quantum measurement is the ideal entanglement between the measured system and the pointer of apparatus .",
    "the work of this mechanism depends on the choice of the form of initial state of the pointer . for a general initial state of the pointer , it is difficult to obtain an explicit condition under which @xmath174 @xmath175 becomes zero .",
    "the solution to this problem concerns the consideration of the classical limit of the motion of the pointer as a large system . in general , for certain particular states , the classical limit of the expectation value of an observable should recover its classical value form .",
    "such quasi - classical states can give definite classical trajectories of a particle in the classical case .",
    "in this sense the mean - square deviation of the observable is zero ; and accordingly the expectation value of the position operator defines a classical path . in next section",
    "we will discuss a similar problem in greater detail in association with the random phase induced by the heisenberg s momentum - coordinate uncertainty .",
    "in the above discussion the quantum realization of measuring process boils down to the appearance of decoherence in the entanglement between the measured system and measuring apparatus only due to the coupling of the measured system with the inner environment rather than that between the pointer of apparatus and the inner environment .",
    "it is well - known that quantum decoherence can be explained in two ways : the usual explanation for decoherence in a which - way experiment based on heisenberg s position - momentum uncertainty relation[15 ] , and the current explanation based on quantum entanglement , which is not related to this uncertainty relation directly . in the latter explanation the quantum correlations between the environment and the considered system are responsible for the destruction of quantum coherence . in the present paper",
    "the considered system is a composition formed by the measured system plus the pointer .",
    "in fact , in the previous sections we have adopted the second viewpoint to deal with quantum measurement problem . in this section",
    "we will see that the first explanation can also work well in our modelled quantum measurement problem . to this end , we first show that the back action of the inner environment on the system plus pointer implied by heisenberg s position - momentum uncertainty relation will disturb the phases of states of the system plus pointer.this result [ 16 ]    let us return to our model mentioned in the last section .",
    "we assume that the initial state @xmath176 of each component of the inner environment is a real wave packet , which is symmetric with respect to both the canonical coordinate @xmath177 and the corresponding canonical momentum @xmath178 @xmath179 we will not need its concrete form . rather we assume it to be of gaussian type with the variance @xmath180 @xmath181 in @xmath182 here , we adopt the definition of the standard deviation @xmath183 for a given phase @xmath184 physically , once @xmath185 is given , the variance of @xmath186 can not be arbitrary since there is heisenberg s position - momentum uncertainty relation @xmath187 in the last two sections , the conclusion drawn seems to depend on the choice of the concrete form of the initial state , but now we can argue that this is not the case with the above consideration .",

    "therefore , the inner environment washes out the interference of any two components of the system plus the pointer .    in the above reasoning",
    "we make the connivance that there exists a finite minimum of @xmath209}$ ] .",
    "this point is just guaranteed by heisenberg s position - momentum uncertainty relation @xmath210 in fact , because @xmath211 is a linear combination of @xmath212 and @xmath186 and @xmath213 for the real wave function average , there should be a quantum limit for its variance @xmath214@xmath215 if one wishes the highest possible for @xmath216 one should not make @xmath217 arbitrarily small , because this will make @xmath218 arbitrarily large .",
    "so it is optimal to take @xmath219 , and we have the finite minimum @xmath220 so we have a minimum of phase uncertainty @xmath221 this result qualitatively illustrates the many - particle amplification effect of uncertain phase change .    the direct relationship between the two explanations for decoherence can also be revealed explicitly in our present model . as a matter of fact , this problem has been tackled by stern , aharonov and imry , with the observation@xmath222}}\\rangle $ ] [ 17 ] .",

    "just reflect the uncertainty of phase change in the measuring process .",
    "the above arguments shed a new light on the understanding of the relationship between bohr s complementarity principle and heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "it is well known that the principle of complementarity usually refers to the wave - particle duality in quantum mechanics .",
    "it says that the quantum - mechanical entity can behave as particle or wave under different experimental conditions , but these two natures excluded each other in the experiment .",
    "for example , in the famous yang s double - slit experiment , the matter wave of a single particle can apparently pass through both slits simultaneously . in this sense",
    "the experiment emphasizes the nature of wave and so there  forms an interference pattern . on the contrary , if a ` which - waydetector is employed to determine the particle s path , the interference pattern is destroyed .  this is because ' which - way experiment focuses on the nature of particle with classical location,path  .",
    "this can further be explained in terms of heisenberg s uncertainty principle : the uncertainty in particle s momentum will introduce random phase difference between two paths and thus destroys the interference . at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that durt et al[18 ] reported a which - way experiment in an atom interferometer in which the ` back action ' of path detection on the atom s momentum is too small to explain the disappearance of the interference pattern .",
    "we would also like to emphasize that the arguments about the quantum description of the macroscopic object such as the moving mirror is closely related to the schroedinger@xmath231s cat problem [ 19,20 ] , a conventional topic of quantum decoherence concerning the state superposition for macroscopic object .",
    "most recent progress has been made in demonstrating schrodinger@xmath231s cat state in various macroscopic quantum systems such as superconductors , laser - cooled trapped ions , photons in a microwave cavity and @xmath232 molecules[21 ] .",
    "according to the viewpoint in this paper , a system with many microscopic degrees of freedom can behave quantum mechanically only if it is sufficiently decoupled from the environment and the phases of its inner states match very well .    in sum , we have proposed an alternative zurek s triple approach for quantum measurement with time independent hamiltonian .",
    "the calculation for a specific model shows the possibility of implementing our approach .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the above discussed extremely - idealized model the interaction between the particles composing the moving mirror has not been considered .",
    "but we do nt think this is a big problem . starting with the main idea developed in this paper",
    ", we can discuss more general situation with inter - particle interaction in a similar way . although the exactly solvable model in this paper might not exist in reality , the idea of quantum adiabatic separation or the master equation is physically meaningful .",
