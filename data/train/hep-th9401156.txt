    "this model is particularly simple in the @xmath4 limit where the spin problem maps to free fermions .",

    "this divergence is the manifestation of the fact that the continuous symmetry of global spin rotations can not be broken in one space dimension .",

    "this state has an energy gap and an expansion in powers of @xmath20 is rapidly convergent . in the opposite @xmath4 limit ,",
    "where @xmath21 , there is a theorem@xcite due to kennedy , lieb and shastry and to kubo and kishi , which proves that there exists long range order with the spins lined up _ on the xy plane _ for @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) .",
    "the same theorem proves that , in the ising regime , the antiferromagnetic ground state extends _ at least _ down to an anisotropy parameter @xmath24 .",
    "no theorem is known for the isotropic case @xmath25 and spin @xmath26 . for @xmath27 dyson ,",
    "lieb and simon@xcite proved a theorem which shows that there is nel order _ even _ at the isotropic antiferromagnetic point .",
    "finite size diagonalization@xcite , quantum monte carlo@xcite and variational estimates@xcite , are more consistent with a nel antiferromagnetic ground state for the isotropic antiferromagnet . for two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets ,",
    "the semiclassical @xmath12 expansion is free of the infrared divergencies found in one dimension .",
    "this approach predicts that the low energy limit of the isotropic antiferromagnet is a non - linear sigma model _ without _ a topological term@xcite .",
    "this latter results have been confirmed by detailed renormalization group studies@xcite which yield an excellent agreement with experiments on @xmath28 .",
    "these results suggest that the anisotropic quantum antiferromagnet has a phase diagram with just two phases : ( a ) a nel state with ising anisotropy for @xmath29 , and ( b ) an @xmath4 phase for @xmath30 . for @xmath29",
    "the ising anisotropy should make all excitations massive ( _ i.e. _  no goldstone bosons for @xmath29 ) .",
    "for @xmath31 the @xmath32 @xmath4 symmetry is spontaneously broken and there should be _ one _ goldstone boson ( spin wave ) . in this scenario , exactly _ at _ the isotropic point @xmath17 , the @xmath33 global symmetry of the heisenberg model is spontaneously broken and there should be _ two _ goldstone bosons ( spin waves ) , as predicted by the non - linear sigma model@xcite . in some sense",
    "there is a phase transition at @xmath17 in that the nel order parameter should jump _ discontinuously _ to zero as @xmath0 is _ decreased _ through @xmath17 .",
    "precisely _ at _ @xmath17 the @xmath4 and nel orders are equivalent under an @xmath34 rotation and , thus , there is still long range order .",
    "in contrast , the one - dimensional spin-@xmath13 chain has a _ line of fixed points _ for @xmath35 and nel order in the massive phase @xmath29 . in section [ sec-1/s ]",
    "we give an argument , based on the @xmath12 expansion , in support of this general scenario .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the anisotropic quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice using a generalized wigner - jordan transformation constructed earlier by one of us@xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite it was shown that the wigner - jordan transformation in two dimensions is a special form of a statistics changing transformation which , quite generally , is achieved by coupling particles to ( lattice ) chern - simons gauge fields with a properly chosen coupling constant @xmath36 . the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet becomes equivalent to a system of spinless fermions which interact with each other ( just as in the case of the spin chain ) but which are also coupled to the chern - simons gauge field .",
    "thus , even in the @xmath4 limit this system is interacting .",
    "systems of this type have been considered recently in connection with the problem of anyon superfluidity  @xcite and the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe )  @xcite . unlike the case of the spin chain , the equivalent fermion problem is never free and a new type of approximation has to be found .",
    "the analog of mean field theory in this context is known as the average field approximation ( afa ) ( defined below in section  [ sec - cslattice ] ) .",
    "we will also show that the physics of this problem is hidden at the mean - field level and it is only revealed by a careful consideration of the fluctuations .    just as in systems of anyons or in the fqhe ,",
    "the energy spectrum predicted by the afa consists of free fermions with an effective band structure generated by the self consistent flux .",
    "we find that , for the sector with @xmath19 ( which corresponds to half - filling of either the hard - core bosons or the fermions ) the average uniform effective flux is equal to one - half of the flux quantum .",
    "thus , on average , we find a _ flux phase _ analogous to that of the gauge theory approach to quantum antiferromagnets of baskaran and anderson@xcite , affleck and marston@xcite and kotliar@xcite .",
    "the afa also predicts that , for @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 ) , a gap opens up in the energy spectrum . in this regime the fermion density _ and _ the flux acquire a modulation with wave vector @xmath39 .",
    "the wigner - jordan transformation maps the @xmath40-component of the spin @xmath41 at @xmath42 to the fermion occupation number @xmath43 by @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we identify this regime with nel antiferromagnetic order . for @xmath45 the afa spectrum of fermions is massless .",
    "recently , wang@xcite has studied the heisenberg model on a square lattice using the wigner - jordan transformation of reference @xcite combined with an approximation similar to the average field approximation discussed in section  [ sec - meanfield ] .",
    "the results of the average field approximation ( afa ) that we present here disagree with wang s , mainly because his form of the afa is not fully self - consistent .",
    "this mean - field spectrum is incompatible with the scenario proposed above , based on the semiclassical expansion .",
    "there , the spectrum of low lying states contains _ only _ integer spin fluctuations ( _ i.e._spin flips )",
    ". some of these states may be massless ( as for @xmath46 ) or all massive ( such as for @xmath47 ) but they are all _ bosonic_. in particular , and in contrast with one - dimensional systems , the @xmath12 expansion predicts the existence of long range order .",
    "this problem is solved by a careful consideration of the role of the fluctuations .",
    "as expected , symmetry plays a crucial role here .",
    "the main problem is that , for small values of @xmath0 , the afa fermion spectrum is gapless . for arbitrary values of the chern - simons coupling @xmath36 ,",
    "two types of gaps , even or odd under time reversal ( @xmath48 ) or parity ( @xmath49 ) can be generated by fluctuations .",
    "the lagrangian at the level of the afa is even under both @xmath49 and @xmath48 .",
    "thus , we should expect that fluctuations will generate all terms with low scaling dimension ( _ i.e. _   operators which are either relevant or marginal ) which are compatible with the symmetries of the full system .",
    "notice that here we encounter the _ opposite _ of the situation usually found with spontaneously broken symmetries where the mean - field theory has _",
    "less _ symmetry than the full system .",
    "the symmetry analysis becomes more transparent in terms of an effective theory for the low energy degrees of freedom .",
    "this effective continuum theory for the two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet on a square lattice turns out to be a theory of two species of relativistic dirac fermions ( moving at the fermi velocity defined in section  [ sec - critical ] ) coupled to a chern - simons gauge field and to the fluctuations of an effective nel order parameter field .",
    "this effective field theory is derived in section  [ sec - critical ] .",
    "this theory is a generalization to 2d of the well known equivalence between the antiferromagnetic spin _",
    "chain _ and a field theory of interacting relativistic fermions in @xmath50 dimensions , known as the luttinger - thirring model .    in this language ,",
    "the fermion spectrum can be understood in terms of the possible energy gaps , or _",
    "masses _ , of the fermions and of the symmetry properties of the operators connected with these masses .",
    "our analysis shows that the nel order parameter acts like a mass operator which does not break @xmath49 or @xmath48 and which we will denote as @xmath51 . in the nel phase",
    "the two species of fermions acquire a mass , but with relative _ opposite _ sign .",
    "however , for general values of the coupling constant @xmath36 , the chern - simons term breaks both @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , quantum fluctuations of the chern - simons field will necessarily generate all terms which break the same symmetries .",
    "a fermion mass term with the _ same sign _ for both species also breaks both @xmath49 and @xmath48 and we find that it does get generated by quantum fluctuations",
    ". we will refer to this as the _ induced _ fermion mass , @xmath52 .",
    "the actual phase diagram follows from the competition of these two mechanisms .    the generation of a parity breaking mass term changes radically the long distance behavior of the system .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that fermions with masses which break time reversal and parity induce chern - simons terms in the action of the gauge fields at length scales long compared with the correlation length of the fermions , _",
    "i.e. _  the inverse of the parity breaking fermion mass . also , the sign of the _ induced _ chern - simons term is equal to the sign of the mass of the fermion .",
    "hence , at length scales long compared with @xmath53 , we expect to see a finite renormalization of the chern - simons coupling constant from its bare value @xmath36 to some effective value .",
    "this effective value depends on the pattern of symmetry breaking , _",
    "i.e. _  on the relative signs of the induced masses which , in turn , are determined by the bare coupling @xmath36 itself and by the nature of the ground state .",
    "we find that the sign of @xmath52 is such that the induced chern - simons coupling tends to _ reduce _ the bare chern - simons coupling .",
    "this renormalization can be viewed as a tendency to screen the bare statistics .",
    "this is a manifestation of a more general property which we may think of as a  lenz law of statistics \"  @xcite .",
    "thus , we arrive to the following scenario . at small @xmath0",
    ", the fermions acquire a parity breaking mass @xmath52 through the fluctuations of the gauge field . in turn , at distances long compared with @xmath53 , a chern - simons term is induced with a coupling constant which tends to cancel the bare statistics .",
    "we will find in section  [ sec - phase ] that for @xmath54 the cancellation is complete and the gauge fields are actually gapless at long distances !",
    "this scenario is reminiscent of anyon superfluidity .",
    "we will identify the gapless transverse gauge fluctuation ( _ i.e. _  laughlin s mode  @xcite ) with the gapless _ transverse _ spin wave of the @xmath4 regime .",
    "clearly two fermion masses with different symmetry necessarily compete with each other .",
    "we expect that when they become of comparable magnitude @xmath55 a phase transition should occur . for this range of @xmath0 ,",
    "one of the two species of fermions has a mass that is very small and , at least nominally , is going to vanish at some critical value of the anisotropy @xmath56 .",
    "we will identify this phase transition with the @xmath34-symmetric heisenberg point@xcite .",
    "this phase transition occurs at a value of the anisotropy @xmath57 .",
    "this phase transition preempts the na \" i ve second order transition predicted by the afa from taking place .",
    "this mechanism seems to bear a close analogy with a fluctuation - induced first order transition  @xcite .    to summarize , the chern - simons ( or wigner - jordan ) approach to the spin @xmath26 anisotropic quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet yields a phase diagram which is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the semiclassical @xmath12 expansion .",
    "the physically correct ( _ p.c .",
    "_ ) phase diagram is not found at the level of the average field approximation and , except in the regime of strong ising anisotropy , it is due almost entirely to fluctuation effects . in this paper",
    "we show how this physical picture is realized in the context of the chern - simons theory .",
    "this is a ( necessary ) first step before these methods could be applied to more subtle problem such as frustrated systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec-1/s ]",
    "we develop the semiclassical @xmath12 theory of the anisotropic antiferromagnet . in section  [ sec - cslattice ]",

    "in contrast , in conventional mean field theories of interacting fermions at finite density on a lattice ( but with zero gauge flux ) there is no critical coupling and the spectrum is always gapped in the presence of nesting . in such cases ,",
    "the gap dependence for small @xmath227 would be of the form @xmath237 .",

    "in critical phenomena , it is usually the case that the exponents found at the level of  classical \" approximations such as mean field theory or in the large-@xmath195 limit , get modified due to the effects of fluctuations .",

    "we will see in section [ sec - critical ] that the system that we are studying here is indeed related to a theory of self interacting relativistic fermions but _ not _ in the large @xmath195 limit .",
    "thus , in principle , fluctuations are expected to correct this exponent .",
    "however , we will also show that this second order phase transition is never reached and that it is preempted by a fluctuation induced first order transition at a value of lambda @xmath56 strictly larger than @xmath240 .",
    "we will also show that , at this fluctuation induced first order transition , the system has the expected physical properties of the isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet in a nel state .",
    "when applied to the isotropic case ( @xmath17 ) , the results of the afa imply a nel state with a value for the order parameter @xmath241 and the energy @xmath242 per bond .",
    "these results should be compared with the best numerical estimate of the energy , @xmath243 per bond@xcite . nevertheless , it is interesting that this approximation yields a nel state instead of a flux phase , as one might have guessed beforehand .",
    "but , is this the correct spectrum ? according to the afa ,",
    "the spectrum consists of free fermions with an energy gap for @xmath1 but gapless otherwise .",
    "clearly this spectrum has nothing to do with what we found semiclassically in section [ sec-1/s ] .",
    "earlier work in anyons and in the fqhe suggests that fluctuations should play a crucial role .",
    "however , notice that since for @xmath2 the afa spectrum is gapless , the fluctuations may yield much more important effects than what we have described with the afa .",
    "in particular , this gapless case was found in reference@xcite in the case of semions at half filling and was found that the state was not determined by the afa alone .    hence , the next logical step is to look at the effects of fluctuations around the solutions of the afa .",
    "while it is possible to carry out this calculation and to keep the full lattice effects at the same time , the expressions are very cumbersome and not amenable to an analytic treatment . instead , we will resort to a different approach in which only the low energy degrees of freedom are kept .",
    "this is equivalent to replace the system by an effective continuum field theory .",
    "these methods are accurate provided that the gaps do not become too large , in which case the lattice effects may become dominant . this limitation will force us to work at values of @xmath0 close to @xmath240 .",
    "nevertheless , our results will be qualitatively correct even away from this regime .",
    "this approach is pursued in section[sec - critical ] .",
    "in this section we will consider the behavior of the system near the critical anisotropy @xmath240 . the mean field theory of section [ sec - meanfield ] yielded an energy gap for the _ fermions _ which vanishes linearly as @xmath235 from above .",
    "the problem that we want to address here is the nature of this phase transition .",
    "we will find that the transition at @xmath244 does not take place as a result of radiative corrections , namely of fluctuations of the gauge field .",
    "instead , a different transition with a _ larger _ critical value @xmath56 will actually occur and supersede the afa - predicted transition at @xmath244 . by counting goldstone modes",
    "we will be able to identify the transition at @xmath56 with the isotropic heisenberg point .",
    "we will now develop an effective theory for the low energy degrees of freedom and construct an effective field theory for the fluctuations about the afa .",
    "to do so we will adopt a point of view which follows quite closely the treatment of the one - dimensional anisotropic spin-@xmath9 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain@xcite .",
    "however , the physics that we find is very different .",
    "the jordan - wigner approach that we have used in this paper closely resembles the jordan - wigner transformation of one - dimensional systems .",
    "the main difference is that , in one space dimension , the only flux that can be defined is the one that is trapped by the _ entire _ chain and , hence , it is equivalent to a boundary condition . in two dimensions , in addition to global or topological flux , it is possible to generate local flux .",
    "local fluxes can not be reduced just to boundary conditions and a local , fluctuating , gauge degree of freedom appears necessarily in the effective theory .",
    "we begin by first summarizing the standard procedure used in one - dimensional systems , first introduced by luther@xcite .",
    "we will next follow that construction for the two dimensional case and use it to discuss the critical behavior near @xmath240 .",
    "the fermionization of the one - dimensional spin chains is usually done in the following manner@xcite .",
    "first , the algebra of spin one - half operators is realized in terms of canonical fermion operators _ via _ the use of the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "the resulting system consists of a set of _ spinless _ fermions hopping between the nearest neighboring sites of a one dimensional chain of atoms .",
    "two fermions can not share the same site ( pauli principle ) and only interact when on nearest neighboring sites with a coupling constant equal to twice the strength of the @xmath131 coupling constant .",
    "the total fermion number is equal to the number of down spins ( depending on the definitions ) .",
    "there are some subtleties concerning boundary conditions which are important but are not related to the issues that are being discussed here .",
    "thus , the sector of the spin system with total @xmath19 maps onto the half - filled portion of the hilbert space of the fermi system .",
    "notice that in one dimension the fermion degrees of freedom exhaust the hilbert space and no other degrees of freedom are needed to represent the states of the spin chain .",
    "the second step@xcite consists of finding a quantum field theory in one space dimension which yields the exact long distance critical behavior of this system of interacting spinless fermions@xcite .",
    "this is done by separating the slow from the fast components of the fermi fields . in one dimension",
    ", the fermions can either move to the left ( left movers ) or to the right ( right movers ) .",
    "the non - interacting fermi system ( equivalent to the spin one half chain ) has two fermi points with momenta @xmath245 .",
    "the left and right moving components of the fermi field can be thought of as the _ chiral _ components of a two - component dirac spinor in one space and one time moving at a  speed of light \" equal to the fermi velocity @xmath246 .",
    "the equivalent quantum field theory has the left and right movers interacting through a backscattering process ( up to umklapp processes which are crucial to reproduce the correct behavior of the isotropic heisenberg model@xcite ) .",
    "the resulting field theory is the well known luttinger - tomonaga - thirring model@xcite which , by using bosonization , can be shown to be equivalent to the sine - gordon field theory@xcite ( if the umklapp terms are kept ) .",
    "the result is that for weak ising coupling ( _ i.e. _  strong @xmath4 anisotropy ) the spectrum of the system is that of fermions with anomalous dimensions ( as a result of the backscattering interactions ) up to a value of the backscattering coupling constant at which the umklapp processes become marginal operators ( and beyond which , in the ising phase , they are relevant ) . in the ising phase",
    "there is an energy gap for all excitations .    in the case of the two - dimensional spin system ,",
    "the afa of section [ sec - meanfield ] yielded a spectrum of free fermions with a  flux phase \" band structure . at half filling , _",
    "i.e. _  total @xmath19 , the flux phase band structure has a  fermi surface \" which reduces to four fermi points located at @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "just as in the case of the one - dimensional spin chain , whose fermion description has two fermi points , the two - dimensional problem can also be mapped onto a dirac - like problem of affleck and marston @xcite . the main differences between the problem that we discuss here and the flux phase of affleck and marston is that ( a ) the fermions here are spinless and ( b ) instead of a hubbard - stratonovich field which fluctuates both in amplitude and phase we have just a fluctuating phase on the bonds .",
    "the chern - simons term is not present in the system discussed by affleck and marston .    we now follow the methods and notations of reference @xcite to obtain an effective continuum theory .",
    "since the detailed derivation is rather tedious we will only highlight the procedure .",
    "our general strategy will be to look for the terms in the action which involve only low energy degrees of freedom .",
    "we will only keep terms with the smallest numbers of derivatives in each of the fluctuations since higher derivative terms are irrelevant in the renormalization group sense .",
    "we should keep in mind that this procedure will only give an approximate value for the coupling constants of the effective low energy theory since instead of integrating out the high energy degrees of freedom we are simply neglecting them .",
    "hence , even though the form of the effective action will still be correct the values of the parameters ( _ e.g. _  the anisotropy @xmath0 ) at which transitions may occur will not coincide with the predictions of the lattice system .",
    "in particular the critical anisotropy will not be precisely @xmath251 , but only approximately .",
    "we will have to use the symmetry properties of the spectrum of excitations at a certain value of the coupling constant of the effective theory to identify the isotropic point .",

    "this is so because the gauge fields can , and do , couple the different fermionic components .",

    "conversely , in the fermion limit @xmath344 or @xmath345 , the dimensionless coupling constant is weak , @xmath346 .",

    "it is possible to show that the operator @xmath361 does not acquire an expectation value to all orders in perturbation theory in the coupling constant @xmath360 . also ,",
    "because this symmetry is present , renormalization effects do not induce fermion mass terms in the lagrangian , which are proportional to @xmath361 and thus brake the symmetry explicitly .",
    "the @xmath50-dimensional system has very special scaling properties . in space - time dimensions",
    "@xmath363 , the coupling constant @xmath360 is dimensionless .",
    "then , the standard field - theoretic analysis tells us that the theory defined by the lagrangian @xmath364 , the gross - neveu model  @xcite , is renormalizable .",

    "the effect of this operator , which represents umklapp processes in the lattice theory , is to end the line of fixed points at a multicritical point which is in the kosterlitz - thouless universality class .",

    "however , a mass term proportional to the operator @xmath361 is _ even _ under the exchange of fermionic species ( or sublattices , which is the same ) but it is _ odd _ under parity ( @xmath49 ) and time reversal ( @xmath48 ) transformations . in contrast , @xmath370 does not break these symmetries .",
    "the reason is that , for _ each _ species , the operator @xmath361 changes sign under @xmath49 and @xmath48 and , hence , @xmath370 changes sign too .",
    "however , this effect is equivalent to a redefinition of the sublattices and , thus , it breaks neither parity nor time reversal .",
    "for this reason , the operator @xmath370 is usually called a parity invariant mass term . thus , renormalization effects can not induce a parity invariant mass term in perturbation theory since it is a symmetry breaking field .",

    "they argue that the fluctuations of the gauge fields induce anomalous dimensions in the fermion operators and , as a result , the four - fermi operators become less irrelevant as @xmath36 grows larger .",
    "however , their analysis is based in dimensional regularization .",
    "it is well known that this regularization scheme sets to zero all singular feynman diagrams except for logarithmically divergent terms .",
    "since it is an analytic regularization method , it also sets to zero all contributions which can not be continued in dimension .",
    "thus , fermion mass terms are not induced in dimensional regularization .    at the infrared stable fixed point @xmath380",
    ", the lagrangian @xmath381 is manifestly scale invariant .",
    "the only parameter left is the chern - simons coupling constant @xmath36 which is dimensionless .",
    "hence , at least in the absence of fluctuations , it is at a fixed point and it has no scale .",
    "however , it is easy to convince oneself that fluctuations lead to divergent corrections of the classical ( that is , mean field ) values of the observables .",
    "the presence of divergent contributions in the perturbation series requires the use of a cutoff or , more generally , of a regulator .",
    "any cutoff introduces a microscopic scale in the problem and therefore it breaks the apparent scale invariance .",
    "thus , in the presence of a cutoff , dimensionful terms can be induced by renormalization effects . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "an induced mass term will have to be proportional to the cutoff since there is no other scale left .",
    "the theory that we are studying has a natural cutoff , the lattice spacing , which acts as a natural scale .",
    "hence , in this case , it is physically incorrect to use dimensional regularization",
    ". furthermore , the chern - simons term breaks both @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , it is expected that renormalization effects should generate all possible terms which break the same symmetries .",
    "the parity - odd fermion mass term @xmath382 breaks precisely the same symmetries .",
    "hence , unlike the @xmath50-dimensional case there is no symmetry that prohibits these terms to be induced by renormalization .",
    "unlike the @xmath50-dimensional theory , non - perturbative tools such as bosonization are not available for the study of relativistic systems in @xmath238 dimensions . in order to proceed further we will use a semiclassical approximation , like the one of section [ sec - meanfield ] , but going beyond the leading order . in @xmath50-dimensions",
    "this approach would not be sufficient since this approximation misses the marginality of the interaction .",
    "however , in @xmath238 dimensions the four fermion interaction is irrelevant ( in weak coupling ) and this approximation reproduces this result correctly . in order to determine the induced fermion mass @xmath52 , we will compute the leading self - energy correction to the fermion propagator due to fluctuations of the gauge field .",
    "since the gauge field couples in the same way to both species of fermions , the only possible induced mass term is @xmath361 which is even under the exchange of species . since this term is odd under @xmath48 and @xmath49 it can only arise from fluctuations of the chern - simons gauge field .",

    "thus , while the spectrum of the semiclassical theory consists of two massless fermions for all @xmath439 and two massive fermions ( but whose masses have opposite signs ) for @xmath440 , the quantum fluctuations of the gauge fields make the fermion spectrum generically massive for _ all _ values of @xmath336 ( and , hence for all @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq : m ] ) shows that , for @xmath36 positive and @xmath439 , @xmath441 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath442 , @xmath443 is always negative . however",
    ", @xmath444 goes through zero and changes sign at some critical value of the coupling constant @xmath445 @xmath446 for the value of @xmath447 , of interest for the heisenberg antiferromagnet , we get @xmath448 .    thus , we conclude that the quantum fluctuations yield the following spectrum for the fermions . for @xmath449",
    "the two species of fermions have masses which , for general values of @xmath336 have different absolute values but have the _ same _ sign .",
    "this sign is _ opposite _ to the sign of @xmath36 . in contrast , for @xmath450 the two fermionic species have masses with different absolute values _ and _ opposite signs .",
    "precisely _ at _ @xmath451 , the mass of one of the species of fermions passes through zero .",
    "we should regard this phenomenon as a _ phase transition _ and @xmath451 as a critical point . from the arguments presented above",
    "we should expect that the critical value @xmath451 should correspond to a critical value of @xmath0 , which we will denote by @xmath56 , and that there should be a phase transition at @xmath56 in the anisotropic quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "given that the fluctuations make such important effects already at the level of the leading corrections to the afa , it is natural to inquire what are the effects of even higher order corrections .",
    "it is clear that nothing special happens at @xmath397 and that it does not correspond to a phase transition which has been shifted to @xmath451 .",
    "the apparent discontinuity in the derivative of the masses at @xmath397 is an artifact of the leading order calculation .",
    "higher order terms will smooth out this spurious effect .",
    "the actual value of the critical coupling will also be renormalized by higher order terms .",
    "we now will argue that the phase transition at @xmath452 should be identified with the _ isotropic _ heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "the argument in support of this identification relies on the counting of massless excitations of the system . in turn",
    ", we will identify these massless excitations with the goldstone modes of the antiferromagnet .    at this level of approximation , the spectrum of fermions is massive for generic values of the anisotropy with one of the species becoming massless just at the critical coupling .",
    "let us now investigate the spectrum of the bosonic excitations , @xmath301 and @xmath348 , as a function of @xmath453 . since the fermions are massive , it is possible to integrate them out off the partition function and to find an effective action for the bose fields which is local at length scales long compared with the inverse of the mass . from the work of deser , jackiw and templeton  @xcite",
    "we know that the long distance effective lagrangian for the gauge field , @xmath454 , induced by the fluctuations of a fermion of mass @xmath70 , is of the form @xmath455 where we recognize the last term as a chern - simons term and the sign of its coupling constant is _ equal _ to the sign of the fermion mass @xmath70 .",
    "the parameter @xmath456 is proportional to @xmath457 .",
    "a similar analysis implies that the fluctuations of @xmath348 are always massive .",
    "however , since the fermions are actually massive at @xmath458 , the fluctuations of the ne ` el order parameter field @xmath459 _ never _ become critical .",
    "the total effective action for the fluctuating gauge field is the sum of three contributions : ( a ) the ( bare ) chern - simons term with coupling constant @xmath36 , and ( b ) two additional chern - simons terms each with the value of eq .  ( [ eq : lind ] ) .",
    "thus , the _ total _ chern - simons coupling constant , @xmath460 is @xmath461 we find , @xmath462 thus , in the phase in which the effective fermion masses have the _ same _ sign , the fluctuations of the fermions act so as to reduce ( or _ screen _ ) the bare value of the chern - simons coupling constant @xmath36 .",
    "this is the ",
    "lenz law of statistics \" referred to in the introduction .    for the particular case of interest for the antiferromagnet , @xmath447 ,",
    "the screening is _ complete _ and @xmath463 for the case of bosons!. thus , the chern - simons term is cancelled out from the effective action of the gauge field which now represents massless excitations .",
    "this cancelation of the chern - simons term from the effective action of the gauge field is the anyon superfluid scenario of references  @xcite . in the anyon superfluid",
    ", the transverse massless gauge field is interpreted as the goldstone boson of the superfluid state .",
    "we identify this regime with the @xmath4 phase of the antiferromagnet .",
    "conversely , for @xmath464 , we get @xmath465 and all collective modes are massive . in this phase",
    "the ne ` el order parameter is non zero and _ all _ excitations have a gap .",
    "this is the _ ising _ phase of the antiferromagnet .",
    "the phase diagram is now _ almost _ complete .",
    "two issues still need to be resolved : ( 1 ) the nature of the transition point at @xmath451 and ( 2 ) are the fermion states really part of the spectrum for any value of the coupling constant ?",
    "these two problems actually are not independent from each other .",
    "let us first consider the fate of the fermions . for @xmath464 ,",
    "the fermions have non - zero masses with opposite sign . in this phase ,",
    "the effective chern - simons coupling constant is equal to @xmath466 .",
    "hence , in this phase , by the standard argument of statistical transmutation , chern - simons gauge field turns the massive _ fermions _ into massive _",
    "bosons_. however , for @xmath467 , the long distance effective action for the gauge field does not include a chern - simons , which cancels out but , instead , the leading term has a maxwell form .",
    "thus , the actual physical mass ( or gap ) of the fermion will be significantly renormalized by the fluctuations of the transverse massless collective mode ( the gauge field ) .",
    "the result , exactly as in the case of the semion superfluid  @xcite , is that due to the quantum fluctuations of the collective mode , the fermion acquires a logarithmically divergent mass and , therefore , it disappears from the physical spectrum .",
    "the presence of infrared divergent corrections to the fermion self - energy in the range @xmath467 has important consequences for the ne ` el order .",
    "( [ eq : contspe ] ) relates the expectation value of the ne ` el order parameter @xmath370 to the expectation value of the field @xmath348 ( this equation is valid beyond the saddle point approximation provided that the field @xmath348 is replaced by its exact expectation value ) . at the level of the saddle - point , the expectation value of @xmath348 is equal to @xmath468 .",
    "higher order corrections involve fermion self - energy insertions in the low order diagrams . for @xmath469 ,",
    "these corrections are finite in the infrared . however , for @xmath470 , these corrections are infrared divergent ( due to the fermion self - energy insertions ) and negative ( since they have to give a value smaller than the classical result ) .",
    "the precise computation of these effects to all orders is difficult and beyond the domain of perturbation theory .",
    "the presence of these infrared divergent contributions , already in the leading corrections , suggests that the ne ` el order is unstable for @xmath471 and that the exact expectation value of this operator has to vanish in that regime .",
    "an alternative picture of this effect can be seen by noticing that , as the coupling constant @xmath472 is decreased from large values ( that is from the classical ne ` el regime ) and one of the masses becomes small , tunneling processes between the two ne ` el states become increasingly favorable . in particular , the magnitude of the energy per unit length of a ne ` el _",
    "domain wall _ is set by the mass of the fermionic excitations .",
    "thus , in the regime in which the fermionic excitations have a finite mass , the energy per unit length of the domain wall is finite .",
    "below @xmath451 , the infrared divergencies in the fermion self - energy will force the energy per unit length of the wall to vanish .",
    "consequently , the domain walls will condense in this regime and will destroy the ne ` el long range order . precisely at @xmath451 ,",
    "the energy per unit length of the domain wall is still finite since there is still ne ` el order .",
    "thus , the domain wall energy should drop to zero with a jump at @xmath451 .",
    "the domain wall condensation as a mechanism for the destruction of long range order is well known in @xmath50-dimensional systems , where the solitons play the role of the domain wall .",
    "hence , we conclude that the ne ` el order parameter should drop to zero discontinuously at @xmath451 and to vanish for all @xmath473 .    in contrast , the operator which creates ( or removing ) one fermion _ and _ one flux quantum simultaneously , is gauge invariant and it has a _",
    "finite _ mass . in anyon",
    "superfluidity this state is usually called the vortex and it has the statistics of an anyon . in our problem , again by statistical transmutation , it is a massive _ boson_. the mass of this state should scale with @xmath444 .",
    "hence , it should vanish _ exactly _ at @xmath451 . in the lattice",
    "chern - simons theory this state is created by an operator which changes both charge and flux . for the case of the antiferromagnet ,",
    "the operator which creates this state is @xmath474 .",
    "thus , we argue that the massless fermion of our spectrum is actually the extra goldstone boson of the antiferromagnet .",
    "since this state becomes massless only at @xmath451 , we identify this phase transition with the _ isotropic _ quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "this point is then viewed as a limiting point and it has the attributes of both phases . in particular , it has a non - vanishing value for the ne ` el order parameter and two goldstone bosons  @xcite .",
    "we also note , in passing , that in one - dimension a strikingly similar picture of the nature of the isotropic point ( from the point of view of the symmetry analysis ) was developed by luther and peschel  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of our problem , unlike the case of the one - dimensional spin chain , there are no non - perturbative methods available , such as bosonization , that will allow for an exact treatment of the long distance behavior .",
    "the topological invariance of the chern - simons theory strongly suggests that no further renormalizations occur and that we have successfully characterized the infrared stable fixed points . a detailed analysis of the phase transition at @xmath451 , particularly the determination of its universality class , critical exponents , _ etc .",
    "_ , requires a more sophisticated analysis of the effective theory than the one performed here .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath397 is in the universality class of theories of self - interacting relativistic fermions ( of the gross - neveu type ) .",
    "our analysis shows that this fixed point is unstable and does not represent the long distance behavior of the system .",
    "it is interesting to note that the removal of the phase transition at @xmath397 and its replacement by the transition at @xmath451 where the ne ` el order parameter drops to zero _ discontinuously _ , is strongly reminiscent of the physics of fluctuation induced first order transitions .",
    "we can also give a renormalization group picture for the arguments presented above .",
    "the afa or , equivalently , the semiclassical theory of this section , does not represent faithfully all the relevant fluctuations of the system .",
    "in particular , the _ infrared stable _ fixed point associated with the @xmath4 phase is simply not present in the semiclassical theory .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the gauge field contain the appropriate relevant operator , the parity breaking induced mass term .",
    "once this operator is generated , the flow of the coupling constants is drastically changed as we explore the low energy regime . in particular",
    ", the effective action of the gauge fields acquires a finite renormalization of its chern - simons coupling constant which tends to screen the statistics .",
    "the fermions are also affected by this flow since the physical low energy mass ( or energy gap ) of the spectrum is altered by the fluctuations of the bosons . in the @xmath4 phase ,",
    "the excitations of the gauge fields are massless and their quantum fluctuations suppress the fermions from the spectrum . in the ising phase , their fluctuations turn the fermions into bosons . clearly at both stable fixed points ,",
    "parity _ and _ time reversal are not broken ( for @xmath447 ) .",
    "we conclude this section with a few remarks .",
    "firstly , our arguments show that , for all values of the anisotropy , there are no states in the spectrum with the quantum numbers of a fermion",
    ". all the states are bosonic .",
    "this is not an accident since the system is not in a spin liquid state for all values of the anisotropy .",
    "nevertheless , given the analogies between the afa and the flux phases of the theories of frustrated antiferromagnets , our results should be viewed as an indication that , once fluctuations are fully taken into account , the flux phases could become more like the standard phases of antiferromagnets .",
    "we have presented qualitative arguments which show that the phase transition at @xmath451 can be viewed , in some sense , as a first order transition since the order parameter must have a jump at that point .",
    "a more rigurous proof of this statement still needs to be constructed",
    ". nevertheless , the arguments presented above show clearly the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon . a direct computation of the spin correlation function @xmath475 should demonstrate quite explicitly the presence of an additional massless state at the critical point . work on",
    "this problem is currently in progress .",
    "in this paper we have presented a field theory for the anisotropic quantum antiferromagnet on a square lattice , based on the chern - simons or wigner - jordan approach .",
    "we discussed in detail the phase diagram , as a function of anisotropy , at the level of the average field approximation .",
    "we found a continuous , second order phase transition at a critical anisotropy from a flux - like phase to an ising phase .",
    "we showed that this phase transition is spurious and that the massless flux phase can not possibly describe the the @xmath4 regime of the quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "we used a semiclassical theory , based in the method of spin coherent states , to derive an anisotropic non - linear sigma model for this system and derived a phase diagram for the system , valid in the limit of large spin .",
    "we considered the role of fluctuations around the afa and showed that they induce relevant operators , not included in the afa , which drive the low energy behavior of the system .",
    "we derived an effective field theory of self interacting fermions coupled to chern - simons gauge fields and showed that its fluctuations contain all the necessary relevant operators to yield a correct phase diagram .",
    "in particular they induce @xmath49 and @xmath48 symmetry breaking fermion mass terms which should necessarily be present for arbitrary values of the chern - simons coupling constant .",
    "we gave a set of arguments which indicate that the fluctuations of the gauge field drive the theory away from the universality class of theories of self - interacting relativistic fermions ( of the gross - neveu type ) .",
    "we identified the infrared stable fixed points and showed that the spectrum of the system at theses fixed points coincides with the expected spectrum of the phases of the antiferromagnet discussed in section [ sec-1/s ] .",
    "we conclude with a comment on the accuracy of the afa .",
    "the afa has become a standard tool and it is widely used in a variety of fields of condensed matter , most prominently in theories of the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "the difficulties that we found in applying the afa to the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet show that this approximation can be unreliable if the resulting fermion spectrum is massless .",
    "in such situation fluctuations may ( and generally will ) induce relevant operators which will necessarily generate gaps in the fermionic spectrum .",
    "this is not a problem for theories of the incompressible states of the fqhe but could well be the case for the compressible even denominator states .",
