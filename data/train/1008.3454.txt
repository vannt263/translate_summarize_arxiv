    "the hall viscosity may represent an additional invariant by which we can characterize quantum hall states . in the work of read @xcite it follows directly from conformal field theory ( cft ) description of quantum hall states and it is related to the conformal spin of the cft field that is associated with the electron description . in this way some non - unitary cfts and corresponding , presumably gapless , quantum hall states may have a well - defined hall viscosity .",
    "the question is whether the  quantization \" of the hall viscosity will persist as we modify model hamiltonians for which the states are exact zero energy states i.e. whether these phases despite being gapless have an invariant - the hall viscosity .",
    "we still do not have a definite answer for gapfull cases , but this question seems related and relevant .",
    "the second question is : if a quantum hall state can not be expressed by a cft correlator like the fermi - liquid - like state at 1/2 , whether it may still have the invariant - hall viscosity equal to the value of laughlin states which simple considerations of orbital spin of electron may motivate @xcite . on the other hand in that case we may think that the hall viscosity is the limiting value of the series of hall viscosities of the states of jain series that leads to the fermi - liquid - like state . if the hall viscosity is proportional @xcite to the shift of the state multiplied by its filling factor the limiting value will diverge and certainly we will not have a finite (  quantized \" ) value associated with other states constructed as cft correlators .    in this paper we will discuss the hall viscosity of the fermi - liquid - like state @xcite and phase @xcite at @xmath0 .",
    "we will consider the unprojected to the lowest landau level ( lll ) wave function for the ground state introduced in ref .",
    ", but at @xmath1 i.e. the fermi - liquid - like state of bosons @xcite . the bosonic and fermionic state share the same underlying fermi - liquid - like physics .",
    "the bosonic version will facilitate the calculations of the berry curvature and its coefficient , the hall viscosity , in the case of these gapless systems . in the introductory section ii we will review the basic ansatz for calculating the hall viscosity in the case of quantum hall states that was used in ref . .",
    "in section iii the hall viscosity of free fermi gas is discussed as a step towards the calculation for the fermi - liquid - like state . in section",
    "iv the hall viscosity as a response to a small deformation of the fermi - liquid - like state is discussed ( a ) when the system is quasi - one - dimensional , ( b ) in the case when the fermi surface is rectangular , and finally ( c ) in the case of interest i.e. when the fermi surface is isotropic and circular .",
    "the next section , section v , discusses the hall viscosity of a system under a general deformation , and section vi the importance of the inversion symmetry for the neutral part as an effective symmetry for composite fermions ( cfs ) that is present in the systems with rectangular shape , which are deformed .",
    "section vii contains a discussion of results and conclusions .",
    "the approach @xcite to the hall viscosity that we find in the literature relies on calculating the berry curvature of shear deformations of the ground state that is adiabatically transformed .",
    "this means an assumption is made that the state is non - degenerate along the process .",
    "this can be assured if the system has a gap which is the characteristic of usual quantum hall states .",
    "the shear deformations are examined by following how the quantum liquid is spread out in the deformed geometry of a torus ( we will discuss the boundary conditions ( bcs ) shortly)- see figure 1 .        the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 describe the deformation from the reference point @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "there are two equivalent approaches in the literature .",
    "the first one is ( a ) to stay in the coordinate space that we begin , with  old \" coordinates @xmath6 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] , but study the solutions of a deformed hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian is the usual local hamiltonian in  new \" coordinates @xmath7 but now expressed in terms of the old coordinates using the coordinate transformation @xmath8 , associated with the deformation .",
    "the usual ( periodic ) boundary conditions are applied .",
    "the second approach is ( b ) to apply the deformed boundary conditions i.e. a new condition@xcite in the direction of @xmath9 and stay with the same local ( undeformed ) hamiltonian .",
    "both approaches lead to the same deformed ground state @xmath10 which should be used in the formula for hall viscosity with the berry curvature : @xmath11 calculated at the reference point @xmath4 and @xmath5 . to recover the physical units we should multiply with @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are in a general case the lengths associated with a rectangular system . in the following we will study such a general geometry in which the deformations from a rectangle with lengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 are made - see figure 2 .        if we consider a gapped system of non - interacting electrons that fill the lll to get the hall viscosity we have to sum the contributions from each single particle state in the lll .",
    "the wave functions that describe the way how a single particle wave function is changed as the geometry of the finite - volume system is varied ( figure 2 ) are @xmath15 we did not include the normalization of each wave function that is labeled by an integer @xmath16 , where @xmath17 i.e. the number of flux quanta through the system ; in our case this number is equal to the number of electrons . the coordinates",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are old coordinates and the wave functions satisfy the ordinary periodic bc ( pbc ) in @xmath18-direction : @xmath20 and the magnetic bc in @xmath19- direction : @xmath21 we will relax@xcite the demand for the magnetic bc ( or we may take large @xmath22 limit @xcite in eq.([twf ] ) ) . the wave function becomes simpler in this cylinder geometry : @xmath23 where we included the normalization .",
    "we have a set of orthonormal wave functions which can be used for the calculation of the berry curvature as a sum of contributions of each single particle state .",
    "as we prove @xcite in the appendix a , if the wave function is non - analytic i.e. non - holomorphic in @xmath9 variable only in its normalization i.e. can be expressed as @xmath24 , its contribution to the hall viscosity is @xmath25 specifying to our set , eq.([cyf ] ) , the sum of all contributions is @xmath26 therefore we recovered the well - known result ( for @xmath1 qhe ) using the cylinder geometry and it will be the same even if we were applying the so - called  thin - torus limit \" i.e. cylinder limit for which @xmath27 .",
    "classically and in the adiabatic response theory it is expected @xcite that the system with time - reversal symmetry does not have the asymmetric ( hall ) viscosity .",
    "we study the asymmetric viscosity of the free fermi gas in the following .",
    "we will use the berry curvature formula to calculate the hall viscosity even for this system assuming that in the adiabatic response , when we probe a finite fraction i.e. small finite system , the ground state stays non - degenerate as @xmath9 is varied at least for a small interval before a reconfiguration of the fermi surface . in the case of free fermi gas the tiny gap @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the length of the system , @xmath30 keeps the filling of the fermi see intact at least for values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the neighborhood of @xmath33 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore because the hall viscosity is the berry curvature at a specific point in the parameter space and not an integral of it in the same space the demand for the ground state being non - degenerate can be relaxed to the same requirement in the neighborhood of the unperturbed point .",
    "in fact the linear response theory leads to the berry curvature formula @xcite .    in our case of the free fermi gas",
    "we need a small enough system .",
    "we will adopt the approach in ref . and study the deformed hamiltonian : @xmath34 , \\label{defham}\\ ] ] on space @xmath35 \\times [ 0 , l_y]$ ] , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we seek the solutions in the form : @xmath36 as we demand that locally we have the same equation irrespective whether we work with  old \" or  new \" coordinates .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath37 .",
    "but the demand for pbcs and orthogonality leads to @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are integers .",
    "therefore the quantized energy levels are : @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{disp}\\ ] ] though the deformation @xmath9 modifies the eigenvalues , eigenstates are independent of it , and this leads to zero value for berry curvature and the hall viscosity as expected in a time - reversal invariant system . as we recovered the result that is valid for a system of any size , we will use the obtained description and formulas even in the large @xmath42 limit in the following .",
    "we will consider the bosonic fermi - liquid - like state at the filling factor @xmath1 because we expect that the conclusions will not depend on the kind of the laughlin - jastrow factor in the wave function .",
    "therefore we study wave function : @xmath43 which is not normalized , and @xmath44 is the vandermonde determinant and @xmath45 the slater determinant of free waves",
    ". therefore we study the unprojected to lll wave function",
    ". we will assume the following evolution of the wave function under deformation @xmath9 : each factor will evolve according the deformed single - particle hamiltonians : ( a ) the one with magnetic field as in avron et al . with magnetic boundary conditions in the case of the evolution of the part that  sees \" the magnetic field i.e. vandermonde determinant and ( b ) the hamiltonian given in eq.([defham ] ) with pbcs that governs the evolution of the part with plane waves .",
    "therefore we assume separate evolutions that we know very well .",
    "as we study the small deformations of a rectangular system and plane waves do not depend on it , the most important question is what is the shape of the fermi sea of the unperturbed finite fermi system in a rectangular geometry .",
    "this is a difficult question though we believe that in the thermodynamic limit the fermi sea will assume its circular , isotropic shape .",
    "but if we stay with the shape of a rectangle even in the thermodynamic limit , as we should do just as in the laughlin case when we apply the berry curvature formula @xcite the question is still there @xcite .",
    "it has to be resolved only by studying the full interacting system in the lll . here",
    "we will be studying ( a ) a limiting case of thin torus ( cylinder ) , ( b ) a system with rectangular shape of its fermi surface and then reach conclusions in the case ( c ) which is an isotropic , circular fermi surface .    before that we will analyze the berry curvature formula for the wave function in eq.([flls ] ) with the assumed evolution in general terms . because the part with slater determinant of free waves does not depend on @xmath9 , the expression for the hall viscosity",
    "is again @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the norm of the wave function in eq.([flls ] ) and the derivatives are calculated at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the system can be viewed as in fig .",
    "3        then because of the pbc in @xmath18-direction we have the quantization of the momentum as before @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "now we take @xmath27 limit along @xmath51 to keep @xmath52 constant . for the fermi - liquid - like state that means that the neutral fermions in the @xmath53-space will form a line along @xmath19 direction with two fermi - points instead of a circle ( line ) for a fermi surface . in real space that is described by the following wave function , @xmath54 where we assumed an odd number of electrons .",
    "notice that there is no @xmath18-dependence .",
    "therefore when we ask for the norm of the complete wave function ( with the laughlin - jastrow factor at @xmath1 -vandermonde determinant ) we get @xmath55 under translations of @xmath19-variables : @xmath56 due to the gaussian factors in @xmath19-integration for @xmath57 we can assume that relevant values of @xmath19 s in the product are @xmath58 $ ] . because @xmath59 , when @xmath60 we can neglect the presence of @xmath19 s in the sine functions and due to the scalings , @xmath61 , we recover the result for the hall viscosity identical to the integer quantum hall effect at @xmath1",
    ".      the fermi gas with a rectangular shape of its fermi surface may be rather artificial but as we already discussed ( a ) this shape may appear in small systems with rectangular boundaries and ( b ) the conclusions reached and constructions applied to this system will serve as a stage for discussing the problem with rectangular boundaries in the thermodynamic limit and circular shape of the fermi surface .",
    "let us assume that we have a fermi surface of a rectangular shape where , for simplicity , we take that the length and width are the same and proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "( to retain pbcs ( instead of antiperiodic bcs ) we may demand that @xmath63 is an odd number . )",
    "the ground state function of the ideal gas has to be an eigenvector under inversion symmetry : @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) and that constrains its form to two possibilities : ( 1 ) @xmath68\\bigg\\},\\label{constr}\\ ] ] where slices are lines in @xmath53 - space , along @xmath69 and @xmath70 direction , of length @xmath63 each and to each one is assigned @xmath63 number of particles , see figure 4 .        for a fixed @xmath63 number of particles we have two slices or lines symmetrically positioned in @xmath53 space around @xmath71 line ( figure 4 ) .",
    "so as a first step we divide particles in @xmath63 slices ( lines , groups ) , and at the end we antisymmetrize @xmath72 that construction in the curly brackets , which represents a particular division into @xmath63 groups .",
    "see an example with 4 particles in appendix b. ( we introduced slicing in @xmath53 space although at this point it seems redundant - only division in @xmath63 groups and later antisymmetrization is all that is in eq.([constr ] ) ; slicing in @xmath53 - space is helpful to introduce and analyze more general fermi surfaces as we will see later on . )    the second possibility ( 2 ) is with @xmath18 s and @xmath19 s interchanged .",
    "if the width and length are not the same , for example @xmath73 then for a single slice of @xmath74 integers ( integers denote particles of the particular slice or group ) , @xmath75 , we have to symmetrize , in addition , smaller slice of @xmath76 integers , with @xmath77 of them , i.e. @xmath78 so that @xmath18 - part is also symmetric under permutations inside @xmath75 .",
    "then our norm , i.e. @xmath47 , for the compressible quantum hall state at @xmath1 becomes a sum of terms , each representing two fixed permutations @xmath79 of @xmath42 integers as in the following , @xmath80 where we suppressed ( did not write ) the part that corresponds to @xmath18- integration .",
    "( note now @xmath81 in general due to tha @xmath18- dependence of the wave function describing fermi sea . )",
    "now we can shift each @xmath82 , by @xmath83 and estimate how the scaling with @xmath32 can be affected with the fermi sea part .",
    "the factors that come out , @xmath84 , ( besides the gaussians in @xmath19 s ) will suppress the contributions of terms , eq.([term ] ) , for which @xmath85 and @xmath86 differ too much and in the following we will assume @xmath87 . with this in mind",
    "we concentrate on a single slice : @xmath88 now we ask again the question when @xmath89 .",
    "because in this case @xmath90 is not small we can have @xmath91 for @xmath92 and an estimate can be that this can happen for all pairs @xmath93 and @xmath94 in eq.([slice ] ) for which @xmath95 and we might think that there are @xmath96 of them . but",
    "this is an overestimate for the construction in eq.([constr ] ) because by making division in slices we do not have the factor @xmath97 for each pair of particles .",
    "as we do not have as many pairs as @xmath98 , but because of slicing only around @xmath99 , the @xmath100 should be reduced @xcite by @xmath90 and therefore is not of the order of @xmath42 , which would pose a problem in the scaling argument for the hall viscosity and influence its final value .",
    "therefore we argued that we can model the contribution of each term as in eq.([term ] ) with @xmath101 as @xmath102 where @xmath103 . even if the specific value of @xmath104 depends on the choice of grouping of particles for slicing in eq.([constr ] ) , by extracting a leading contribution in @xmath42 we can recover the same result for the hall viscosity as before .",
    "we in fact are taking the large @xmath42 limit before the limit @xmath105 , which is allowed @xcite but implies the same value of the hall viscosity only in this limit .",
    "more precisely , if we do not assume the effective reduction of each @xmath106 to either @xmath107 or @xmath108 , in the end the term in eq.([term ] ) can be expressed as a series with each member of the form as in eq.([form ] ) , where again @xmath109 , and the argument follows .",
    "this is possible because for any @xmath110 and , as we have due to the shifts and gaussians @xmath111 , we can approximate @xmath112 and an expansion in the differences in @xmath19 s i.e. @xmath113 ) follows .",
    "our expectation is that the composite fermions will make an isotropic , circular fermi surface even in the thermodynamic limit of the system with rectangular boundaries .",
    "nevertheless in this case we have to demand that the ground state of the system retains the inversion symmetry of the system in its neutral sector , i.e. that the fermi part of the ground state wave function is an eigenvector under @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 , transformation .",
    "the rectangular shape is a feature of the system on which the shear transformation is applied .",
    "such a ground state wave function can be constructed by a generalization of the construction in the previous case ( b ) given in eq.([constr ] ) .",
    "now the two slices along @xmath69 and @xmath70 direction are as in figure 5 .        a group of particles , its number equal to the length of the two slices is assigned to them .",
    "as we sweep the whole circle with these two slices we make a certain division of all particles into groups that correspond to slices and therefore , to make the wave function antisymmetric under particle exchange , we need an overall antisymmetrization as in eq.([constr ] ) .",
    "the same arguments as in the case with rectangular fermi surface can be applied here and lead to the conclusion that the hall viscosity of the fermi - liquid - like quantum hall state is unaffected by the presence of the fermi see in the ground state function .",
    "namely all estimates that we did in the rectangular case will be modified by geometrical factors that will not affect the conclusion on the leading behavior in the thermodynamic limit . to illustrate what we mean by geometrical factors",
    "let us consider a fermi surface that is a square with @xmath63 length of each side . in that case",
    "the number of pairs is @xmath117 , but in the case of a circle , which delineates the same volume equal to @xmath42 , we will have for the same quantity @xmath118 i.e. the same leading behavior @xmath119 up to a numerical - geometrical factor .",
    "the most important question when considering the question of the hall viscosity for the fermi - liquid - like state is whether it is dependent on @xmath9 or maybe it is independent of the geometry @xmath121 , which is a remarkable property of the integer quantum hall state@xcite at @xmath1 and other quantum hall states @xcite that exhibit hall conductance plateaus .    when considering arbitrary @xmath9 we have to start with the deformed fermi surface as it follows from the deformed dispersion relation in eq.([disp ] ) .",
    "to simplify the notation we will take @xmath122 or , in general , that @xmath39 and @xmath40 carry factors connected with the lengths and may not be integers .",
    "therefore we write the dispersion relation @xmath123 as @xmath124,\\ ] ] or if we absorb the scaling factor @xmath125 and define @xmath126 as @xmath127 we may focus on the dispersion relation expressed as @xmath128 the equation @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the fermi energy defines the ( deformed and scaled ) fermi surface i.e. @xmath131 which is illustrated in figure 6 .",
    "we find that the maximum values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( that belong to points on the fermi surface ) are @xmath132 and @xmath133 and for @xmath134 we have @xmath135 .",
    "this implies that if we keep @xmath136 we would have the same length for corresponding two slices along @xmath69 and @xmath70 directions that we introduced before . to simplify the discussion in the following",
    "we will assume that this is the case i.e. that due to @xmath136 we have the symmetry under inversion around the axis defined by @xmath137 .",
    "as our deformed hamiltonian in eq.([defham ] ) has the symmetry under simultaneous transformations @xmath138 and @xmath139 or @xmath140 and @xmath141 our dispersion relation , eq.([disp ] ) , has the same symmetry and the corresponding fermi surface as well . this symmetry has to exist in the ground state , which has to accommodate to the deformed rectangular shape for @xmath120 .",
    "for @xmath142 the symmetry can be identified as the inversion symmetry around @xmath18 or @xmath19 axis that has to be generalized to the case with @xmath120 for which we need to include also @xmath138 transformation . with this in mind",
    "we can come up with a ground state wave function that will have this symmetry in the fermi part under simultaneous transformations in coordinate and momentum space .",
    "using the slice decomposition that is illustrated in figure 6 for the deformed fermi surface and with the simplifying assumption @xmath143 the fermi part will look like @xmath144\\bigg\\},\\label{dconstr}\\ ] ] where slices in @xmath69 and @xmath70 direction correspond in the manner of figure 6 ; to each slice in @xmath70 corresponds the slice of the same length in @xmath69 corresponding to the same group of particles .",
    "the exponentials with @xmath145 and @xmath146 carry the momentum @xmath147 , which is due to the deformation of the fermi surface and the absence of the inversion symmetries around @xmath69 and @xmath70 axis .",
    "the momentum @xmath148 lies along the new symmetry line i.e. @xmath149 and represents the momentum of the center of the mass of the particles that belong to the particular slice .",
    "@xmath150 in eq.([dconstr ] ) is again the overall antisymmetrization that will bring all possible assignments of particles into slices in the final form of the wave function .",
    "the construction when @xmath18 s and @xmath19 s ( @xmath145 s and @xmath146 s ) are interchanged is also possible and we will discuss that case later .",
    "the complete deformed wave function for the fermi - liquid - like state has the gaussian factors of the form : @xmath151 that enter the integral for @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath32 is small the @xmath82 can fluctuate being less localized with the gaussian .",
    "so the relevant interval of @xmath82 values in the integral becomes larger and the sequence of approximations for two particles , beginning with the corresponding term in the product in the integral ( eq.([slice ] ) ) , as @xmath152 are more likely to be allowed .",
    "each term like this will contribute @xmath153 when the scaling @xmath154 is applied .",
    "if , for small enough @xmath32 , we assume that for each pair we can do this approximation , in addition to the overall exponent , which we get by the change of variables in the @xmath19-integration , of order @xmath42 , we will get another contribution of order @xmath155 that would lead to the divergence of the berry curvature and therefore for finite @xmath32 of the hall viscosity .",
    "this is certainly an overestimate but the possibility of divergence seems lurking .",
    "applying arguments similar to the one in section iv b we come to an estimate that the number of relevant pairs is around @xmath156 .",
    "therefore only for strong deformations for which @xmath157 , we may expect the departure of the value for the hall viscosity from the one of laughlin states .",
    "these arguments can not be precisely quantified but suggest that the hall viscosity of the fermi - liquid - like state may depend on the value of @xmath9 for very large deformations . but as we do apply the large @xmath42 limit to recover the laughlin state value for the hall viscosity as @xmath158 and because here relevant @xmath32 is of the order of @xmath159 , we can expect the same hall viscosity value in the same limit for any finite @xmath32 .",
    "therefore the feature of the laughlin states that their hall viscosity is independent of @xmath9 may stand as a reflection of their true topological nature due to the comparison with the fermi - liquid - like state that can recover the same value only in large @xmath42 limit .    the precise estimate how the hall viscosity depends on @xmath9 ( in the case of the fermi - liquid - like state ) is hard to get also because of the exponentials with @xmath148 that carry dependence on @xmath82 .",
    "( we have to keep in mind that the scaling @xmath160 is a purely mathematical transformation of variables under the @xmath47 integral and does not affect @xmath53-variables . ) in the argument above we assumed @xmath161 for each slice @xmath162 , which might not be the case .",
    "for @xmath5 we view the inversion symmetry as the symmetry under transformations @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath163 around @xmath18-axis or @xmath164 and @xmath165 , @xmath163 around @xmath19-axis . for @xmath120 ,",
    "as we already noted , it can be generalized by adding @xmath166 transformation .",
    "the symmetry has to be incorporated in the ground state wave function , more precisely in its neutral part , when we discuss the system with rectangular shape ( or deformed rectangular shape , @xmath120 ) and our aim is the calculation of the hall viscosity .    in the case of the fermi - liquid - like state two constructions",

    "the constructions are valid for both circular and rectangular fermi surface . in appendix",
    "b we display the functions @xmath169 and @xmath170 in the case of 4 particles . in that case",
    "it can be easily shown that the state - construction that is @xmath171 , is identical to zero . as the square of the inversion symmetry is equal to identity in general",
    "we expect that wave functions @xmath169 and @xmath170 represent two degenerate ground states and two independent sectors of the fermi liquid .    throughout the paper we discussed the case @xmath169 for the fermi - liquid - like state and concluded that , in the thermodynamic limit , around @xmath5 the hall viscosity is equal to the one of laughlin states and that our expectation is that for general @xmath172 this will still be true in the same limit .",
    "if we try similar arguments in the case @xmath170 we can come to the expectation that , due to the cosine functions in the dependence on @xmath19 s , no change in the overall scaling with @xmath32 will occur and for this construction the hall viscosity is independent of @xmath9 and equal to the one of the laughlin states .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian that describes the evolution of the part of the fermi - liquid - like state that sees magnetic field is not invariant under the inversion symmetry and the  true \" energetics of the problem at @xmath1 ( fermionic at @xmath173 ) will certainly differentiate between the two possibilities for the ground state : with fermi parts @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "we expect that the construction with fermi part @xmath169 , irrespective whether the ground state is non - degenerate or degenerate will make a ground state as it can smoothly evolve from the thin torus limit and its fermi part , eq.([onedfl ] ) , when the gauge is fixed so that the gaussians are along @xmath19-axis .",
    "the construction with @xmath170 fermi part may appear as an additional sector .",
    "in this paper we discussed the berry curvature calculations of the hall viscosity for the unprojected to the lll wave function of the fermi - liquid - like state .",
    "we concluded that in the linear response , with small deformation of the system and in the thermodynamic limit , the hall viscosity takes the value characteristic for the laughlin states ( eq.([value ] ) ) .",
    "we presented arguments that the value is the same even for general deformations in the same limit .",
    "the preprint in ref . appeared very recently when we were in the process of finishing of the present paper .",
    "there the claim is made , on the basis of the berry curvature formula applied to the wave functions in the lll ( or projected to a definite ll ) , that at @xmath173 , irrespective whether the state is incompressible or not , if the hamiltonian is particle - hole symmetric , the hall viscosity acquires the laughlin value .",
    "the value is the same irrespective of the deformation ( @xmath9 ) . though our analysis is on the unprojected ( to the lll ) wave function of fermi - liquid - like state , we agree on the value of the hall viscosity for the state at @xmath173 in the thermodynamic limit . for a general @xmath9",
    "it is surprising that the same value of the hall viscosity is maintained in the lll @xcite , and somehow has to be reconciled with the expected quantization in the incompressible states .",
    "a way out is to claim that the fermi - liquid - like state has the dissipative ( symmetric ) viscosity nonzero @xcite , but still the quantization of the hall viscosity for the compressible state in the lll undermines our expectation that in the hall viscosity we have yet another characteristic of the incompressible quantum hall states that is quantized i.e. has a constant value under small changes ( perturbations ) of the hamiltonian .",
    "( in other words even gapless phases may have an invariant such as the hall viscosity . )    on the other hand the fermi - liquid - like state and the firmly established phase @xcite at @xmath173 may be viewed as some kind of a critical state where effective particle and hole physics and two jain s sequences of particle states ( from @xmath174 ) and hole states ( from @xmath175 ) meet .",
    "the situation is somewhat similar or reminiscent of the graphene and the critical behavior of the neutrality point of the dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it looks conclusive @xcite no critical behavior in the case of the state at @xmath173 and the hall viscosity is expected .",
    "our study shows that the hall viscosity of the unprojected fermi - liquid - like state at general @xmath9 may deviate from the laughlin state value for finite number of particles .",
    "maybe the behavior for finite number of particles can not be explained by non - interacting or weakly - interacting cf physics if we stay in the lll as it involves higher ll physics i.e. all energy scales , which may reflect its critical nature .    in the adiabatic transport theory that we apply our basic assumption is that flux changing excitations are not relevant or higher in energy for the calculation of the hall viscosity .",
    "the result of ref . seems to give credence to this approach . within assumptions made , we established that the fermi - liquid - like state in the thermodynamic limit in the linear response has the value of hall viscosity equal to the value of laughlin states .",
    "we hope that our analysis will help further elucidation of the problem and the search for the final answer .",
    "the author thanks n. read for his comments .",
    "this work was supported by the serbian ministry of science under grant no .",
    ".      we will prove the formula eq.([form2 ] ) for the ground state function that is holomorphic in @xmath9 variable except for the normalization , which is the case also with the laughlin wave function .",
    "the normalized wave function is @xmath176 where @xmath177 depends on particle coordinates and @xmath9 only .",
    "we want to calculate : @xmath178 @xmath179 therefore @xmath180 @xmath181 is holomorphic in @xmath9 , therefore : @xmath182 then + ( 1 ) @xmath183 it follows that @xmath184 ( 2 ) @xmath185 ( 3 ) @xmath186 from ( [ two ] ) and ( [ three ] ) it follows @xmath187 because @xmath188 and because of ( [ one ] ) @xmath189 we have @xmath190      the wave functions @xmath193 and @xmath194 can be represented by their configurations in @xmath53-space .",
