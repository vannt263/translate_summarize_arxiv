    "has gone well @xcite .",
    "one of these method is the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) , where we can calculate the annihilation diagrams as well as the factorizable and nonfactorizable diagrams .",
    "the rare decays @xmath5 are pure annihilation type decays . in the usual f.a .",
    ", this decay picture is described as @xmath2 meson annihilating into vacuum and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons produced from vacuum then afterwards . to calculate this decay in the f.a .",
    ", one needs the @xmath8 form factor at very large time like momentum transfer @xmath9 .",
    "however the form factor at such a large momentum transfer is not known in f.a .",
    "this makes the f.a .",
    "calculation of these decays unreliable .",
    "the annihilation amplitude is a phenomenological parameter in qcd factorization approach ( qcdf)@xcite , and the qcdf calculation of these decays is also unreliable . in this paper",
    ", we will try to use the pqcd approach , where the annihilation amplitude is calculable , to evaluate the @xmath5 decays . by comparing the predictions with the experimental data",
    ", we can test the pqcd evaluation of the annihilation amplitude .",
    "a @xmath10 boson exchange causes @xmath11 or @xmath12 , and the @xmath13 quarks included in @xmath14 are produced from a gluon .",
    "this gluon attaches to any one of the quarks participating in the @xmath10 boson exchange .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : need1gluon ] . in the rest frame of @xmath2 meson ,",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath16 quarks included in @xmath14 have @xmath17 momenta , and the gluon producing them also has @xmath18 .",
    "this is a hard gluon .",
    "one can perturbatively treat the process where the four quark operator exchanges a hard gluon with @xmath19 quark pair .",
    "it is just the picture of pqcd approach .    in the next section ,",
    "we explain the framework of pqcd briefly . in section [ sc :",

    "it is found that the prediction are is in good agreement with the data , and pqcd approach correctly gives the annihilation amplitude in consequence .",
    "finally , we conclude this study in section [ sc : concl ] .",
    "pqcd approach has been developed and applied in the non - leptonic @xmath2 meson decays @xcite for some time . in this approach , the decay amplitude is separated into soft(@xmath21 ) , hard(@xmath22 ) , and harder(@xmath23 ) dynamics characterized by different scales .",

    ", @xmath27 includes the harder dynamics at larger scale than @xmath28 scale and describes the evolution of local @xmath29-fermi operators from @xmath30 , @xmath10 boson mass , down to @xmath31 scale , where @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath22 describes the four quark operator and the spectator quark connected by a hard gluon whose @xmath33 is on the order of @xmath34 , and includes the @xmath35 hard dynamics .",
    "therefore , this hard part @xmath22 can be perturbatively calculated .",
    "@xmath36 is the wave function which describes hadronization of the quark and anti - quark to the meson @xmath37 .",
    "while the @xmath22 depends on the processes considered , @xmath36 is independent of the specific processes .",
    "determining @xmath36 in some other decays , we can make quantitative predictions here .",
    "we consider the @xmath2 meson at rest for simplicity .",
    "it is convenient to use light - cone coordinate @xmath38 to describe the meson s momenta , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 . using these coordinates we can take the @xmath2 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 mesons momenta as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively , where @xmath44 and we neglect the @xmath7 meson s mass @xmath45 . putting the light ( anti-)quark momenta in @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively , we can choose @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",

    "the last term , @xmath63 , contains two kinds of logarithms .",
    "one of the large logarithms is due to the renormalization of ultra - violet divergence @xmath64 , the other is double logarithm @xmath65 from the overlap of collinear and soft gluon corrections .",
    "this sudakov form factor suppresses the soft dynamics effectively @xcite .",
    "thus it makes perturbative calculation of the hard part @xmath22 applicable at intermediate scale , i.e. , @xmath28 scale .",
    "we calculate the @xmath22 for @xmath20 decays in the first order in @xmath66 expansion and give the convoluted amplitudes in next section .",
