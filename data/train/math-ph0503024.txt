    "growth phenomena are ubiquitous around us .",
    "they have both very practical applications and theoretical relevance .",
    "but they are rarely easy to study analytically and very few rigorous or exact results are known . in two dimensions , the description of a growing domain is often obtained indirectly through the description of a family of univalent holomorphic representations , leading quite generally to equations known under the name of loewner chains",
    ". these techniques , based on the riemann mapping theorem , are conceptually important but usually far from making the problem tractable .    in the last few years , loewner chains",
    "have been discovered which have a large hidden symmetry",
    " conformal invariance  that makes them more amenable to an exact treatment @xcite .",
    "these are known under the name of stochastic or ( schramm ) loewner evolutions sle .",
    "their mathematical elegance and simplicity is not their sole virtue .",
    "they are also natural candidates to describe the continuum limit of an interface in two - dimensional statistical mechanics models at criticality . at the critical temperature and in the continuum limit ,",
    "the system is believed to be conformally invariant and physicists have developed many powerful techniques , known under the name conformal field theory or cft , to deal with local questions in a conformally invariant 2d system . however , nonlocal objects like interfaces posed new nontrivial problems that finally sle could attack in a systematic way @xcite .",
    "the connection between cft and sle is now well understood @xcite and the interplay between the two approaches has proved fruitful .",
    "the way sle describes an interface deserves some comments . as a guiding example , consider the ising model in a simply connected domain , say on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "suppose that the boundary is split in two arcs with endpoints say @xmath4 and @xmath5 and impose that on one arc the spins are up and on the other one the spins are down .",
    "in this situation each sample exhibits an interface .",
    "it joins the two points where the boundary conditions change and splits the domain in two pieces , one with all spins up on its boundary and one with all spins down .",
    "this interface fluctuates from sample to sample .",
    "what sle teaches us is the following .",
    "instead of describing the interface between @xmath4 and @xmath5 at once , sle views it as a curve starting from say @xmath4 and growing toward @xmath5 .",
    "and sle describes the distribution for the addition of an infinitesimal piece of interface when the beginning of the interface is already known .",
    "so the description is in terms of a growth process even if there was no growth process to start with .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the probabilistic aspects of sle as well as its connections with conformal field theory are now fairly well understood .",
    "however , some fundamental questions remain , again directly related to natural questions in the statistical mechanics framework .",
    "the one we shall concentrate on in this note is what happens when , due to boundary conditions , the system contains several interfaces . proposals for multiple sles have already been made in the literature @xcite , but our results point to a different picture .",
    "the simplest situation is in fact when there is only one interface but we want to deal with its two ends symmetrically so that two growth processes will interact with each other .",
    "remember that standard sle deals with the two ends of the interface asymmetrically .",
    "this has a price : time reversed sle is an intricate object .    as a guiding example for more than one interface ,",
    "consider again the ising model in a simply connected domain on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "if one changes boundary conditions from up to down to up and so on @xmath6 times along the boundary , each sample will exhibit @xmath7 interfaces , starting and ending on the boundary at points where the boundary conditions change , forming a so - called arch system .",
    "however , the interfaces will fluctuate from sample to sample and so does even the topology of the arch system .",
    "this topology , for instance , is an observable that is trivial for a single sle",
    ".    our description will again be in terms of growth processes and loewner chains . for standard sle ,",
    "the driving parameter is a continuous martingale and the tip of the curve separates two different states of the system ( up and down spins for ising ) , leading to a well defined boundary changing operator in statistical mechanics .",
    "the relation between the stochastic loewner equation and the boundary changing operator comes via a diffusion equation that they share in common .    for multiple sles",
    ", we expect that for short time scales each curve grows under the influence of an independent martingale . at its tip",
    "stands the same boundary changing operator .",
    "but we also expect drift terms , describing interactions between the curves .",
    "the possibility of different arch topologies makes it even more natural to have a description with one curve growing at each boundary changing point so that each of them is on the same footing .",
    "so @xmath7 interfaces are described by @xmath6 growth processes of `` half - interfaces '' that finally pair in a consistent way to build arches .    in statistical mechanics ,",
    "each arch system has a well defined probability to show up .",
    "the law governing this finite probability space is again described by a boltzmann weight which is nothing but a partial partition function .",
    "our starting point is the reconsideration of the role of boltzmann weights and partition functions in statistical mechanics and their simple but crucial relationship with probabilistic martingales .",
    "this allows us to ask the question `` by what kind of stochastic differential equations can one describe multiple sles ? '' by imposing a martingale property and conformal invariance .",
    "this puts strong constraints on the drift terms and our main result is a description of the family of drift terms that are compatible with the basic rules of statistical mechanics . each drift is expressed in terms of the partition function of the system .",
    "this partition function is given by a sum of boltzmann weights for configurations that satisfy certain boundary conditions : at the starting points of the curves the boundary conditions change .",
    "the partition function depends on the position of these changes , so up to normalization , the partition function is in fact a correlation function .",
    "it satisfies a number of partial differential equations ( one equation for each point ) that are related to the diffusion equations for the multi sle process .",
    "the solutions form a finite dimensional vector space .",
    "the positivity constraint satisfied by physical partition functions singles out a cone which is expected , again guided by statistical mechanics , to have the same dimension of the underlying vector space and to be the convex hull of a family of half lines , so that a generic hyperplane section of the cone is a simplex .",
    "so geometrically , the drift terms are parametrized by a cone .",
    "extremal drifts , i.e. drifts corresponding to extremal lines in this cone , lead to processes for which the final pattern formed by the growing curves is a given arch system .",
    "drifts inside the simplex give rise to stochastic processes where the asymptotic arch system fluctuates from sample to sample . a crucial role to construct martingales describing interesting events",
    "is played by the short distance expansion in conformal field theory because this is what tells which terms in the partition function become dominant when an arch closes , i.e. when two driving processes of the multi sle hit each other .",
    "the vector space of solution of the differential equations for the partition functions has a famous basis indexed by dyck paths , which are in one to one correspondence with arch systems .",
    "but the basis elements do not in general correspond to extremal partition functions",
    ". we shall give a rationale for computing the matrix elements for the change of basis and compute a number of them , but we have no closed general formula .",
    "we shall illustrate our proposal with concrete computations for @xmath8 to @xmath9 interfaces with applications to percolation and the ising model .",
    "we shall also discuss the classical ( deterministic ) limit @xmath10 , where only extremal drifts survive .",
    "the notes also cover the case when a number of boundary changes are very close to each other but the system is conditioned so that they do not pair with each other .",
    "the details are in the main text .",
    "our description is rather flexible in the sense that the speed of growth of each piece of interface can be tuned .",
    "certain limiting cases lead to previously known processes which are examples of sle@xmath11 processes .",
    "it is appropriate here to stress that many of the probabilistic properties of the solutions of the stochastic differential equations that we introduce are conjectural at this point .",
    "we have made some consistency checks and the whole pattern is elegant , but our confidence comes more from our familiarity with conformal field theory and statistical mechanics .",
    "let us briefly recall what is meant by the chordal sle  detailed studies can be found in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the chordal sle process in the upper half plane @xmath12 is defined by the ordinary differential equation @xmath13 where the initial condition is @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a brownian motion with variance parameter @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the explosion time of ( [ eq : chordal sle ] ) with initial condition @xmath18 and define the hull at time @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath21 is a family of growing hulls , @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "the complement @xmath24 is simply connected and @xmath25 is the unique conformal mapping @xmath26 with @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "one defines the sle trace by @xmath29 .",
    "the trace is a continuous path in @xmath30 and it generates the hulls in the sense that @xmath24 is the unbounded component of @xmath31}$ ] . for @xmath32",
    "the trace is a non - self - intersecting path and it does nt hit @xmath33 for @xmath34 so @xmath35}$ ] . for @xmath36 a typical point @xmath37 is swallowed , i.e. @xmath38 for large @xmath19 but @xmath39 . in the parameter range @xmath40 the trace is space filling , @xmath41 .",
    "let us point out that no statistical mechanics models seem to correspond to @xmath42 .    in the definition of chordal sle we took the usual parametrization of time . from equation ( [ eq : chordal sle ] )",
    "we see that @xmath43 , which means ( this could be taken as a definition ) that the capacity of @xmath44 from infinity is @xmath45 .",
    "since the capacity goes to infinity as @xmath46 , the hulls @xmath44 are not contained in any bounded subset of @xmath30 .    if the parametrization of time is left arbitrary , schramm s argument yields : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a continuous martingale with quadratic variation @xmath49 ( an increasing function going to infinity with @xmath50 )",
    "in this formula , both @xmath51 and @xmath48 are random objects .",
    "the capacity of @xmath52 is @xmath53 .",
    "but this is not really more general than eq.([eq : chordal sle ] ) which is recovered by a random time change .",
    "the motivations for our proposal require a good amount of background , but the proposal and its main features themselves can be easily stated . we gather them in this section .",
    "some of the results are conjectures .",
    "the rest of the paper will then be split into sections whose purpose will be either to motivate our proposal in general , or to prove its correctness in certain special but nontrivial cases by explicit computations .",
    "we propose to describe the local growth of @xmath54 interfaces in cft , labeled by an integer @xmath55 and joining fixed points on the boundary by a loewner chain .",
    "we assume that @xmath56 in the following .",
    "we list the set of necessary conditions and equations .    * conformal invariance * : the measure on @xmath54sle is conformally invariant .",
    "hence it is enough to give its definition when the domain @xmath57 is the upper half plane @xmath58 in the hydrodynamical normalization .",

    "@xmath19 is @xmath70 .",
    "* auxiliary function * : the system depends on a function @xmath71 which has to fulfill the following requirements :    @xmath72 @xmath71 is defined and positive for @xmath73 ,    @xmath74 @xmath71 is translation invariant and homogeneous .",
    "its weight is @xmath75 for some nonnegative integer @xmath76 , where is @xmath77 in the physics literature . ]",
    "@xmath78    @xmath79 @xmath71 is annihilated by the @xmath54 differential operators @xmath80.\\ ] ]    we call this system of equations the @xmath54sle system for @xmath54 curves joining together the points @xmath81 and possibly the point at infinity .",
    "systems for radial and dipolar versions of @xmath54sle could be defined analogously .",
    "it is known from cft that ( relaxing the positivity constraint ) , the solutions to @xmath82 form a vector space of dimension @xmath83 .",
    "the positive solutions form a cone and from the statistical mechanics interpretation , we conjecture that this cone has the same dimension and is generated by ( i.e. is the convex hull of ) @xmath84 half lines ( extremal lines , pure states in the sense of statistical mechanics ) so that a transverse section of the cone is a simplex .",
    "so each solution @xmath85 can be written in a unique way as a sum of extremal states .",
    "the numbers @xmath84 have many many combinatorial interpretations , but the one relevant for us is the following .",
    "draw @xmath86 points @xmath87 ordered cyclically on the ( extended ) real line bounding the upper half plane @xmath58 .",
    "consider @xmath88 disjoint curves in @xmath58 such that each @xmath89 is an end point of exactly @xmath8 curve and @xmath90 is an end point of exactly @xmath91 curves .",
    "there are @xmath84 topologically inequivalent configurations , called arch configurations when @xmath92 .",
    "we keep the same name for @xmath93 , writing arch@xmath94 configurations when precision is needed .",
    "motivated by this , we claim the following :    \\a ) to each arch configuration @xmath95 corresponds an extremal state @xmath96 in the following sense : the solution of the @xmath54sle system with @xmath97 can be defined up to a ( possibly infinite ) time , at which the growing curves have either paired together or joined the point at infinity and at that time the topology is that of the arch @xmath95 with probability one .",
    "\\b ) one can decompose a general solution @xmath85 of @xmath82 as a sum of @xmath98    \\c ) the probability that a solution of the @xmath54sle system with auxiliary function @xmath85 ends in arch configuration @xmath95 is the ratio @xmath99 evaluated at the initial condition @xmath100 .",
    "the first step toward a heuristic derivation of the above results will be to explain how to construct martingales  in particular martingales associated to interfaces  from statistical mechanics observables in a systematic way .",
    "but we start with a few comments .",
    "to have a specific example in mind , think again of the ising model at the critical temperature .",
    "let @xmath4 be the lattice spacing .",
    "first , put @xmath6 changes of boundary conditions from spins up to spins down and so on along the boundary at points @xmath101 . in the continuum limit",
    "when @xmath102 but @xmath103 have a finite limit , the partition function behaves like a homogeneous function @xmath104 of weight @xmath105 ( when both @xmath4 and the @xmath106 s are rescaled ) and cft teaches us that @xmath71 satisfies @xmath82 for @xmath6 .",
    "then , if @xmath95 is an arch system , @xmath96 should be ( proportional to the continuum limit of ) the partial partition function when the sum of boltzmann weights is performed only over the interface configurations with topology @xmath95 .    to make generalized arch configurations , choose @xmath54 and @xmath7 with @xmath107 .",
    "put @xmath108 changes of boundary conditions from spins up to spins down and so on along the boundary , @xmath54 at points @xmath101 and @xmath91 at @xmath109 .",
    "sum only over configurations where the interfaces do not joint two @xmath110-type points to each other .",
    "take the continuum limit for the @xmath111 s as before , but impose that all @xmath110 s go to infinity and remain at a finite number of lattice spacings from each other .",
    "this is expected to lead again to a partition function @xmath104 of weight @xmath105 ( when both @xmath4 and the @xmath106 s are rescaled ) and @xmath71 satisfies @xmath82 for the given @xmath54 and @xmath7 . if @xmath95 is an arch@xmath94 configuration , @xmath96 should be ( proportional to the continuum limit of ) the partial partition function when the sum of boltzmann weights is performed only over the interface configurations with topology @xmath95 .",
    "note that the prefactor between the continuum limit finite part and the real partition function is a power of the lattice spacing .",
    "the power depends on @xmath7 , so it is likely to be unphysical to use a non homogeneous @xmath85 in the @xmath54sle system , mixing different values of @xmath7 for a fixed @xmath54 . however , we shall later treat the example @xmath112 mixing @xmath113 and @xmath114 because it is illustrative despite the fact that it breaks scale invariance .",
    "for @xmath112 the solution of @xmath82 with @xmath114 is elementary .",
    "writing @xmath116 and @xmath117 , one finds @xmath118 .",
    "taking the first martingale to be a brownian and the second one to be @xmath105 , one retrieves the equations for sle growing from point @xmath4 to point @xmath5 in the hydrodynamical normalization .",
    "let us recall briefly why .",
    "we start from sle from @xmath105 to @xmath90 .",
    "the basic principle of conformal invariance makes the passage from this special case to the case when sle goes from point @xmath4 to point @xmath5 on @xmath12 a routine task .",
    "if @xmath119 is any linear fractional transformation ( i.e. any conformal transformation ) from @xmath12 to itself mapping @xmath105 to @xmath4 and @xmath90 to @xmath5 , the image of the sle trace or hull from @xmath105 to @xmath90 by @xmath119 is by definition an sle trace from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and this is measure preserving .",
    "the new uniformizing map is @xmath120 and it is readily checked that @xmath121 is a rational function of @xmath122 whose precise form can be easily computed but does not concern us .",
    "let us just mention that this rational function is regular everywhere ( infinity included ) except for a simple pole at @xmath123 and has a third order zero at @xmath124 .",
    "so the map @xmath122 is normalized in such a way that @xmath125 , which is not the hydrodynamic normalization .",
    "but if @xmath126 is any linear fractional transformation , @xmath127 describes the same trace as @xmath128 .",
    "as long as the trace does not separate @xmath5 from @xmath90 , i.e. as long as the trace has not hit the real axis in the segment @xmath129b,\\infty[$ ] , i.e. as long as @xmath90 is not in the hull , @xmath126 can be adjusted in such a way that @xmath130 is normalized hydrodynamically .",
    "then @xmath131 is a function of @xmath132 which is regular everywhere but for a single pole and vanishes at infinity , i.e. one can write @xmath133 .",
    "the following computation is typical of the manipulations made with sle ( see e.g. @xcite ) . write @xmath134 an compute from the definition @xmath135 comparison gives @xmath136 but @xmath126 is regular at @xmath137 from which one infers that @xmath138 ( the poles in the two terms are at the same point ) and @xmath139 ( the two residues add to @xmath105 ) .",
    "going one step further in the expansion close to @xmath140 yields @xmath141 ito s formula gives @xmath142 so the time change @xmath143 together with the definition @xmath144 yields @xmath145 but @xmath146 because @xmath126 is a linear fractional transformation .",
    "finally , setting @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 we can summarize @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a brownian motion with quadratic variation @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155",
    ". thus chordal sle from @xmath4 to @xmath5 in the hydrodynamical normalization is indeed a special case of @xmath115sle .",
    "the above equations are also a special case of sle@xmath156 @xmath157 , but it should be clear that our general proposal goes in a different direction .    as already mentioned , the description of chordal sle from @xmath4 to @xmath5 in the hydrodynamical normalization in fact coincides with chordal sle from @xmath4 to @xmath5 only up to the first time @xmath5 is separated from @xmath90 by the trace .",
    "this time is infinite for @xmath32 , but it is finite with probability @xmath8 for @xmath36 . the most obvious case is @xmath158 .",
    "the equation is nothing but the usual chordal sle@xmath159 ending at infinity , a consequence of locality ( in the sle sense , not in the quantum field theory sense used later ) . at that time",
    ", the real chordal sle from @xmath4 to @xmath5 swallows @xmath90 , whereas the hydrodynamically normalized version swallows @xmath5 .",
    "the solution to this problem is to use conformal invariance and restart the process again in the correct domain at the time when @xmath5 and @xmath90 get separated by the trace . but",
    "this is not coded in the equations .",
    "the previous example should serve as a warning .",
    "some serious mathematical work may have to be done even to make sense of our conjectures , let alone prove their correctness .",
    "the problems might be of different natures for @xmath32 and @xmath160 .",
    "we content with the following naive remarks .",
    "one of the problems is that the arches do not have to close at the same time .",
    "it may even happen that one of the growing curves touches the real line or another curve in such a way that the upper half plane is split in two domains and the one which is swallowed contains some of the growing curves .",
    "our putative description of @xmath54sle processes can be valid in this form only up the realization of such an event .",
    "the first thing to check should be that the event is realized with a probability obtained by summing @xmath161 over all @xmath95 s corresponding to compatible configurations ( see figure [ fig : compatible configurations ] ) .",
    "in particular , the connected component of @xmath90 should contain at least @xmath162 curves for consistency , but that s not an obvious property of our proposal .     over all @xmath95 s corresponding to compatible configurations .",
    "two compatible configurations are portrayed in the figure.__,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    consider the fate of the connected component of @xmath90 .",
    "if @xmath163 is even , conformal invariance suggests to continue the loewner evolution simply by suppressing the points that have been swallowed , i.e. for the @xmath164 remaining points",
    ". if @xmath163 is odd , the same should be done , but the image of the point at which one interface has made a bridge should be included as a starting point for the continuation of the evolution .",
    "preferably , the function @xmath85 for this new @xmath165sle system should not be adjusted by hand to make our conjectures correct , but should appear as a natural limit .",
    "we shall make comments on this and give concrete illustrations later .    for the component that is swallowed , one can use conformal invariance again to change the normalization of the loewner map in such a way that this component is the one that survives and then restart a new @xmath165sle for the appropriate number of points .",
    "this procedure may have to be iterated .",
    "note also that our conjectures for arch probabilities do not involve any details on the martingales @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , we expect that there is some robustness .",
    "but the precise criteria are beyond our understanding",
    ".      our heuristic derivation of the @xmath54sle system will in particular show that if @xmath166 also solves @xmath82 ( even relaxing positivity ) , the quotient @xmath167 is a local martingale .",
    "this can be proved directly using ito s formula .",
    "in particular , @xmath168 is a local martingale bounded by @xmath8 , hence a martingale . on the other hand",
    ", a standard argument shows that if @xmath169 is the probability that the system ends in a definite arch configuration @xmath95 ( once one has been able to make sense of it ) @xmath170 is a martingale .",
    "this is an encouraging sign . to get a full proof",
    ", one would need to analyze the behavior of @xmath171 when one arch closes , or when one growing curve cuts the system in two , to get recursively a formula that looks heuristically like @xmath172 if the system forms asymptotically the arch system @xmath173 at large @xmath50 .",
    "such a formula rests on properties of @xmath174 when some points come close together in a way reminiscent to the formation of arch @xmath173 : @xmath175 should dominate all @xmath96 s , @xmath176 in such circumstances . in section [ sec : sevinterf ] we shall use this to expand explicitly the @xmath96 s in a basis of solutions to @xmath82 which is familiar from cft , very explicitly at least for small @xmath54 .",
    "our proposal for @xmath54sle has a non trivial classical limit at @xmath10 .",
    "the martingales @xmath177 vanish in this limit , but the @xmath178 remain arbitrary increasing functions .",
    "the function @xmath85 does not have a limit , but the @xmath179 do .",
    "they are kind of ricatti variables for which the equations read @xmath180 which have a limit when @xmath181 , comparable to the classical limit of a schroedinger equation . to summarize , the classical limit is    @xmath182 @xmath183 where the auxiliary functions @xmath184 are homogeneous functions of degree @xmath185 which satisfy @xmath186 and @xmath187    it is not too surprising that the differential equations for @xmath85 have become algebraic equations for the @xmath188 s , so that the space of solutions which was a connected manifold for @xmath189 concentrates on a finite number of points in the classical limit .",
    "the classical system , maybe with an educated guess for the @xmath178 s , could be interesting for its own sake .",
    "several processes involving several growing curves have appeared in the literature .",
    "the first proposal was made by cardy @xcite .",
    "it can be formally obtained from ours by forgetting the conditions @xmath82 and choosing a constant @xmath85 .",
    "the corresponding processes are interesting , but the relationship with interfaces in statistical mechanics and cft is unclear for us .",
    "dubdat @xcite has derived a general criterion he calls commutativity to constrain the class of processes that could possibly be related to interfaces .",
    "our proposal satisfies commutativity so they can be viewed as a special case satisfying other relevant physical constraints .",
    "dubdat also came with a special solution of commutativity .",
    "it corresponds to the case @xmath113 in our language .",
    "then the space of solutions has dimension @xmath190 and the corresponding partition function is elementary : @xmath191    a single arch topology is possible , all interfaces converge to @xmath90 , see figure [ fig : factorizable ] .",
    "maybe this is a good reason to call this case chordal @xmath54sle .",
    "there was never any doubt that sles are related to conformal field theories .",
    "the original approach @xcite used the operator formalism because if yields naturally martingale generating functions . here",
    ", we use the correlator approach for a change .",
    "we restrict the presentation to a bare minimum , referring the newcomer to the many articles , reviews and books on the subject ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reader who knows too little or too much about cft can profitably skip this section .",
    "observables in cft can be classified according to their behavior under conformal maps .",
    "local observables in quantum field theory are called fields . for instance , in the ising model , on an arbitrary ( discrete ) domain , the average value of a product of spins on different ( well separated ) sites can be considered . taking the continuum limit at the critical point , we expect that on arbitrary domains @xmath57 there is a local observable , the spin .",
    "the product of two spins at nearest neighbor points corresponds to the energy operator . in the continuum limit",
    ", this will also lead to a local operator . in this limit , the lattice spacing has disappeared and one can expect a definite ( but nontrivial ) relationship between the energy operator and the product of two spin fields close to each other . as on the lattice the product of two spins at the same point is @xmath8 , we can expect that the identity observable also appears in such a product at short distances .",
    "local fields come in two types , bulk fields whose argument runs over @xmath57 and boundary fields whose argument runs over @xmath192 . in this paper",

    "the case @xmath432 is more interesting since the space of such partition functions is of dimension two and coincides with the space of conformal block with 4 insertions of boundary operators @xmath285 , with one localized at @xmath433 : @xmath434 we assume the points to be ordered @xmath435 .",
    "the associated process should describe a family of two curves joining any pair of adjacent points without crossing .",
