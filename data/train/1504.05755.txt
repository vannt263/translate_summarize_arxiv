    "the existence of massive neutrinos provides concrete evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "similarly , the explanation of observed galactic rotation curves in terms of gravitating dark matter ( dm ) further suggests the sm is incomplete .",
    "efforts to explain these two key evidences for new physics are varied , though an interesting approach is to seek a common or unified framework that simultaneously solves both puzzles .",
    "for example , if small neutrino masses are realized via radiative effects  @xcite , it is conceivable that dm plays a role in generating the masses , allowing a type of unified description for massive neutrinos and dm .",
    "this is the motivation for the models of krauss , nasri and trodden ( knt )  @xcite and ma  @xcite .",
    "both models extend the sm so that neutrino masses are generated radiatively with dm propagating in the loop diagram . in order to ensure dm stability ( and preclude tree - level neutrino mass ) a @xmath0 symmetry",
    "is also imposed .",
    "there are a number of generalizations of this basic idea which similarly extend the sm to allow radiative neutrino mass via couplings to dm  @xcite . in common with the knt and ma models",
    ", the generalized models also require the imposition of a new symmetry to render the dm stable . however , it is interesting to consider models where dm stability instead results from an accidental symmetry , in accordance with our experience from the sm , where proton stability manifests the accidental baryon number symmetry .    in this work",
    "we present a model of radiative neutrino mass that _ automatically _ contains an accidental @xmath0 symmetry and thus admits a stable dm candidate .",
    "the model realizes a simple unified framework for the origin of neutrino mass and dm while imposing only a minimal symmetry structure , namely that of the sm .",
    "neutrino mass appears at the three - loop level via a diagram with the same topology as the knt model , while the dm is a neutral fermion with a non - trivial charge under the accidental @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the model requires heavy dm ( @xmath2  tev ) and may be probed via dm direct - detection experiments and future @xmath1 searches .",
    "it also predicts a charged scalar that can appear at the tev scale .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "the model is introduced in section  [ sec : model7 ] .",
    "we calculate neutrino masses and discuss important constraints in section  [ sec : nuetrino_mass7 ] .",
    "relevant information regarding the dm is discussed in section  [ sec : dark_matter5 ] while our main numerical analysis and results appear in section  [ sec : results7 ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conc7 ] .",
    "we extend the sm to include a charged singlet scalar , @xmath3 , a scalar septuplet , @xmath4 , and three real septuplet fermions , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 labels generations .",
    "we adopt the symmetric - matrix notation for the septuplets , writing the scalar as @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the components are given by @xmath9where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are distinct fields , @xmath12 , and similarly @xmath13 .",
    "for the septuplet fermions , denoted as @xmath14 , we have @xmath15the superscript @xmath16 \" denotes charge conjugation and the numerical factors ensure the kinetic terms are canonically normalized . with these fields ,",
    "the lagrangian contains the terms @xmath17where",
    "lepton flavors are labeled by lower - case greek letters , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is a sm lepton doublet ( singlet ) . the scalar potential is denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "note that the exotics @xmath22 and @xmath23 do not couple directly to the sm neutrinos , though they shall play a key role in generating neutrino mass .",
    "the explicit expansion for the fermion mass term is : @xmath24where we defined : @xmath25clearly @xmath26 is a majorana fermion , while the other six components of @xmath23 partner - up to give three massive charged fermions ( per generation ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose a diagonal basis for the fermions , such that @xmath27 , with the masses ordered as @xmath28 .",
    "we shall see below that @xmath23 does not mix with the sm leptons , to all orders of perturbation theory , so eq",
    ".   describes the mass eigenstates , which should be used in the yukawa terms in eq .  .",
    "the lightest neutral fermion will play the role of dm , and we denote its mass as @xmath29 .",
    "the model contains an exact accidental @xmath30 symmetry with action : @xmath31to see this , note that the potential can be written as @xmath32the first four terms trivially preserve the discrete symmetry , while the explicit forms for the last two mixing potentials are term , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote @xmath35 generators for the distinct representations . ]",
    "@xmath36and @xmath37these potentials also preserve the symmetry defined by eq .  .",
    "note that there appears to be a third distinct way to contract the @xmath35 indices in the mixing potential @xmath38 , namely @xmath39 this would explicitly break the @xmath30 symmetry .",
    "however , this term is odd under the simultaneous interchange of the sets of dummy indices @xmath40 and @xmath41  @xcite , and thus vanishes identically .",
    "the full theory therefore preserves the accidental @xmath30 symmetry defined by eq .   and the model _ automatically _ contains an absolutely stable particle that is a dm candidate .",
    "the @xmath30 symmetry also prevents mixing between @xmath23 and the sm leptons . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first such model of radiative neutrino mass with an accidental symmetry that automatically gives a dm candidate .    at tree - level",
    "the components of @xmath23 are mass - degenerate , while the components of @xmath22 experience a mild splitting due to the @xmath42-term in @xmath43 . for @xmath44",
    "this mass - splitting is not significant and is essentially negligible for @xmath45 .",
    "thus , to good approximation the components of @xmath46 are degenerate at tree - level , with masses @xmath47 , as are the components of @xmath22 ( with masses @xmath48 ) .",
    "radiative corrections remove these mass degeneracies ; loops containing sm gauge bosons give small mass - splittings for the components of @xmath23 , leaving @xmath26 as the lightest exotic fermion .",
    "similar splittings are induced for the components of @xmath22 which are readily calculated with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . for most purposes in this work",
    "these tiny splittings can be ignored .",
    "the model contains two distinct @xmath0-odd dm candidates , namely @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "however , @xmath50 has degenerate real and imaginary components and also couples to the @xmath51 boson .",
    "this leads to tree - level @xmath51 boson exchanges that are incompatible with direct detection constraints .",
    "thus , @xmath50 can be excluded as a dm candidate , leaving @xmath52 as the sole dm candidate in the model and restricting one to the parameter space with @xmath53 .",
    "the sm higgs develops a nonzero vacuum value , @xmath54 , breaking the electroweak symmetry in the usual way .",
    "furthermore , in the parameter space with @xmath55 , which preserves the discrete symmetry , the @xmath56-parameter retains its standard tree - level value .",
    "coupling constant encounters a landau pole in the uv , due to the heavy septuplets . ]",
    "note that the inclusion of non - renormalizable dimension 5 operators ( @xmath57 ) can break the accidental symmetry .",
    "in particular , the @xmath57 operator @xmath58 would allow the dm to decay .",
    "this feature is not specific to the present model ; one expects global symmetries to be broken by gravitational effects  @xcite so non - renormalizable operators will , in general , break global symmetries .",
    "this is true even in related models which impose e.g.  a global @xmath0 or @xmath59 symmetry . in our model ,",
    "the fate of the accidental @xmath0 symmetry is analogous to the fate of the accidental baryon number symmetry in the sm .",
    "the latter is broken by @xmath60 operators , leading to proton decay .",
    "however , proton longevity can be ensured by the details of the uv completion , giving either a long - lived or absolutely stable proton .",
    "unsurprisingly , the situation is similar for our dm candidate . in this work we focus on the calculable renormalizable theory .",
    "we note that a number of earlier works have studied larger multiplets in connection with neutrino mass  @xcite ( for related phenomenology see ref .",

    "the combination of the yukawa lagrangian and the terms @xmath62 in the scalar potential , are sufficient to explicitly break lepton number symmetry . consequently sm neutrinos are majorana particles that acquire radiative masses at the three - loop level , as shown in figure  fig:7pletnumass . in the limit where the mass - splittings among components of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are neglected ,",
    "the calculation of the loop - diagram gives @xmath63where the function @xmath64 encodes the loop integrals  @xcite and @xmath65 is the charged - singlet mass .",
    "neutrino masses calculated via eq .   must satisfy the data from neutrino oscillation experiments and reproduce the following best - fit regions for the mixing angles and mass - squared differences : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "matching to these experimental values reveals the regions of parameter space where the model gives viable neutrino masses .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath71 generate flavor changing processes like @xmath1 . calculating the corresponding diagrams in the limit where the mass - splittings are neglected , and including the diagram containing the singlet @xmath72 , gives @xmath73 where @xmath74/[6(x-1)^{4}]$ ] and",

    "a further constraint of @xmath80  ev follows from null - results in searches for neutrino - less double - beta decay  @xcite , though analysis shows that this constraint is readily satisfied in the model .",
    "this constraint is expected to improve after next generation experiments , with an anticipated precision of @xmath81  ev  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned already , the only viable dm candidate in the model is the lightest neutral fermion @xmath82 .",
    "there are two classes of interactions that can maintain thermal contact between the dm and the sm in the early universe .",
    "interactions mediated by the scalar @xmath22 have the cross section @xmath83where @xmath84 is the dm relative velocity , in the centre - of - mass frame . note that there are no @xmath85-wave annihilations when final - state lepton masses are neglected , as the dm is a majorana fermion .",
    "there are no coannihilations mediated by @xmath22 , though given the small radiative mass - splittings , one should include the annihilations of singly - charged fermions : @xmath86and similarly for the higher - charged fermions @xmath87    there are also processes mediated by @xmath88 gauge bosons , which can be calculated in the limit of an exact @xmath35 symmetry .",

    "one can calculate the mass range that gives a viable dm relic density using the above expressions .",
    "however , the cross section into gauge bosons may be significantly enhanced by the non - perturbative sommerfeld correction  @xcite .",
    "one must solve the schrdinger equation in terms of a non - relativistic bound state of two dm particles in order to estimate the non - perturbative sommerfeld correction .",
    "the calculation is somewhat involved , though the correction has been calculated for several @xmath88 multiplets in ref .",
    "@xcite and the effect is found to be important for larger multiplets .",
    "the enhancement of the cross section influences the dm mass required to give the observed relic density as the dm mass is the unique parameter that can control the cross section when the annihilation cross section is dominated by gauge interactions . in eq .  .",
    "] for example , the dm mass is shifted from @xmath95 to @xmath96 for a fermion quintuplet with @xmath97 , from @xmath98 to @xmath99 for scalar quintuplet with @xmath97 , and from @xmath100 to @xmath101 for scalar septuplet with @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "a similar enhancement is expected for the fermion septuplet dm with @xmath97 in our model , though a detailed calculation is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "guided by the results listed in ref .",
    "@xcite we expect the sommerfeld enhancement will increase the requisite dm mass by a factor of approximately 3 . as we shall see , this suggests the required dm mass should be @xmath102 when the sommerfeld effect is taken into account .",
    "the dm annihilation processes which induce monochromatic gamma - rays are also enhanced by the sommerfeld correction in the present universe .",
    "this can be a significant signature of dm as an indirect detection signal .",
    "since the dm mass is predicted around @xmath10320@xmath10425 tev in our model , after including sommerfeld correction , monochromatic gamma - rays at @xmath105 could be detected by future gamma - ray experiments such as cta  @xcite .",
    "there is no tree - level coupling between dm and quarks .",
    "however , @xmath106 boson exchange gives three one - loop diagrams which can produce signals at direct - detection experiments  @xcite .",
    "there are both spin - dependent and spin - independent contributions to the scattering , however , spin - dependent contributions are suppressed by the heavy dm mass . as we consider relatively heavy values of @xmath107  ,",
    "the spin - dependent contributions can be neglected .",
    "therefore spin - independent scattering dominates and the cross section is determined by sm interactions : @xmath108 ^{2}.\\]]the dm scatters from a target nucleus @xmath109 of mass @xmath110 , and the standard parametrization for the nucleon is adopted : @xmath111here @xmath112 is the nucleon mass and @xmath113 is subject to the standard qcd uncertainties . for @xmath114 ,",
    "the cross section for the one - loop processes is @xmath115 , which is just beyond the sensitivity of lux  @xcite for heavy dm with @xmath116 .",
    "note , however , that recent lattice simulations suggest a somewhat lower value of strange content @xmath117  @xcite , which , when combined with cancellations from two - loop diagrams , gives a smaller cross section of @xmath118  @xcite . in either case , the result is beyond the current sensitivity of lux , though future discovery prospects for the dm candidate can be considered promising .",
    "as already mentioned above , to determine the viable dm mass range one should include the sommerfeld enhancement . however , as a first task we perform a numerical scan of the parameter space without the sommerfeld enhancement , determining the favored dm mass range .",
    "we subsequently include a simple estimate of the effect .    for the numerical scan",
    "we seek regions of parameter space that satisfy the previously mentioned constraints , while simultaneously giving neutrino masses and mixings in agreement with the experimental values and a dm relic density within the range @xmath119 .",
    "we consider the free parameter values @xmath120 the results for the values of @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are shown in figure [ omega ] .",
    "we find that viable neutrino masses can be obtained for a large region of parameter space , though the dm mass should be confined to the tidy range of 7.18 - 7.31  tev for the relic density to match the observed value .",
    "this region is somewhat tighter than the corresponding region for the related models with triplets  @xcite and quintuplets  @xcite , due to the fact that the cross sections for annihilations mediated by the couplings @xmath71 , namely eqs .  - , are smaller compared to the contribution of @xmath91 gauge bosons ( [ sigma_w ] ) . in the triplet and quintuplet cases  @xcite the charged lepton contribution is non - negligible , allowing a greater spread for the dm mass interval .",
    "tev gives the best - fit value for @xmath124 in the limit @xmath125.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the sommerfeld enhancement is expected to increase the required dm mass by a factor of roughly 3 .",
    "therefore , in order to approximately take this effect into account , we redo the numerical scan with the dm mass in the relic density replaced by @xmath126 , searching for parameter space that gives viable neutrino masses and mixings and is consistent with low - energy constraints .",
    "this approach only provides a rough approximation for the value of the dm mass but , importantly , it allows us to discover if the requisite heavier values of @xmath121 and @xmath123 are compatible with the low - energy data .",
    "note that , because the relic density calculation has a reduced sensitivity to the couplings @xmath71 ( as dm annihilations in the early universe are dominated by @xmath91 annihilations ) , the key question is whether there is viable parameter space that achieves neutrino mass and satisfies the constraints , given the heaviness of the dm .",

    "there is considerable parameter space that satisfies the constraints with the dm mass in the range 19.7 - 23.1  , centered around the value of @xmath129  , which is preferred in the limit @xmath130 .",
    "the scalar @xmath131 must now be heavier than 19.9 , while the charged scalar singlet @xmath72 can remain as light @xmath132  gev , similar to the case without sommerfeld enhancement effect .",
    "one observes that the branching ratio @xmath133 is smaller than the experimental bound by 4 - 6 orders of magnitude while the constraint of @xmath134 is more severe .",
    "in particular , it is evident that improved measurements of @xmath135 are capable of excluding the model . though not shown in the figure , the preferred regions of parameter space are not ruled out by the data on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ; the extra contribution from the exotics can contribute to the observed discrepancy , though it can not explain it entirely  @xcite .",
    "we note that with only two generations of fermions @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) , the bound on @xmath135 is violated .",
    "therefore three generations of @xmath136 are required to remain consistent with constraints from lepton flavor violating processes .",
    "also , the neutrino data prefers that one does not introduce large hierarchies between @xmath121 and the other exotic masses , @xmath138 and @xmath123 , with @xmath139 preferred .",
    "the exotics are therefore clustered near @xmath121 .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the preferred values of @xmath121 should only be taken as a guide , though our analysis clearly shows that one can satisfy the low - energy constraints with the required heavier values of @xmath121 and @xmath123 .",
