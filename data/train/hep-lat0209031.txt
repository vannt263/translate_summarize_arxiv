    "in lattice numerical studies gauge invariant quantities are usually computed . on the other hand , gauge covariant quantities also provide important information .",
    "the well known examples are quark and gluon propagators , requiring complete gauge fixing , monopoles and p - vortices , which study needs only partial gauge fixing .",
    "the first lattice calculations of the gluon propagator were performed in landau gauge @xcite . nowadays these results are significantly improved , also various gauges are used ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "maximal abelian gauge ( mag ) , used to demonstrate the dual super conductor confinement mechanism , is especially interesting .",
    "propagators in this gauge were not explored carefully enough so far .",
    "the first such study of propagators in the coordinate space was performed in ref .",
    "there was no study of propagators in the momentum space . in this paper",
    "our aim is to close this gap .",
    "we present our results of the high statistics calculation of propagators of the diagonal and the off - diagonal gluon in @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in mag .",
    "complete gauge fixing is achieved by using abelian landau gauge to fix remaining abelian gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "we use the standard parameterization of @xmath0 link matrices , @xmath2 .",
    "then gauge fields are defined as follows : @xmath3 we call @xmath4 the diagonal gluon field , and @xmath5 the off - diagonal gluon field .",
    "the maximal abelian gauge condition in a differential form is @xmath6 nonperturbative fixing of this gauge amounts to the minimization of the functional @xmath7 = \\int d^4 x ( ( a^1_\\mu(x))^2 + ( a^2_\\mu(x))^2).\\ ] ] in our simulations the simulated annealing algorithm @xcite with 20 randomly generated gauge copies is employed to minimize the effect of gribov copies .",
    "after mag , only @xmath1 degrees of freedom remain unfixed .",
    "we fix them using @xmath1 landau gauge .",
    "the differential lattice gauge condition we are using is @xmath8 this condition implies that the diagonal field @xmath9 is not transversal at a finite lattice spacing .",
    "another gauge condition @xmath10 is not considered here and will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "condition ( [ eq : contland ] ) is equivalent to the maximization of the functional @xmath11 = \\sum_{x,\\mu } \\cos\\theta_\\mu(x),\\ ] ] using only @xmath1 gauge transformations .",
    "a local maximization algorithm with 30 random gauge copies is used to accomplish this task . as the `` stop criterion '' for the algorithm we use @xmath12_{new } - f[\\theta]_{old}}{f[\\theta]_{new } } <   \\varepsilon = 10^{-8}.\\ ] ]",
    "we calculate the diagonal propagator @xmath13 and the off - diagonal propagator @xmath14 where fourier transform @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 @xmath17 the physical lattice momenta @xmath18 are related to @xmath19 as follows : @xmath20 since both diagonal and off - diagonal fields are not transversal the general structure of diagonal and off - diagonal propagators is @xmath21 thus we have four structure functions @xmath22 , which are really not independent .",
    "note that in nonabelian landau gauge , @xmath23 , there would be only one formfactor : @xmath24",
    "to calculate propagators the lattice with @xmath25 ( 138 configurations ) at @xmath26 were simulated .",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath27 at this @xmath28 .",
    "the behavior of transversal parts of propagators in the ultraviolet region is the same as in nonabelian landau gauge as our gauge corresponds to that gauge in the limit of large momenta .",
    "both gluons are well described by the perturbative formula @xmath29 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] .",
    "the longitudinal part @xmath30 tends to zero as @xmath31 tends to infinity . and",
    "@xmath32 is small in comparison with other structure functions ( see inset in fig . [",
    "fig : both ] ) .",
    "it increases linearly with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "similar result was obtained in @xcite for the longitudinal part of the photon propagator in 3d compact qed when gauge condition was chosen allowing nonzero longitudinal part at the finite lattice spacing as in our case .",
    "indications that the longitudinal part tends to zero in the continuum limit were found in @xcite .",
    "the sharp increase of @xmath33 at low momenta seems to be related to imprecise @xmath1 landau gauge fixing .",
    "we repeated computations on our smaller @xmath34 lattices ( 300 gauge field configurations ) with reinforced condition  ( [ eq : stopcrit ] ) : @xmath35 decreased down to @xmath36 .",
    "we found that @xmath37 , @xcite .    in ir region one can see a very strong suppression of @xmath38 in comparison with @xmath39 demonstrating the essence of the abelian dominance @xcite , fig.[fig : both ] . at the same time",
    "@xmath40 approaches @xmath38 at @xmath41 .",
    "the off - diagonal propagator thus becomes : @xmath42 fit to this form at @xmath41 with @xmath43 gives @xmath44 .    in the range",
    "@xmath41 the best fit ( @xmath45 ) to @xmath39 is given by the formula @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 .",
    "this shows that behavior of @xmath39 in the infrared region is qualitatively similar to that of the propagator in nonabelian landau gauge  @xcite .",
    "our results clearly show that off - diagonal gluons are suppressed at low momenta thus providing the explanation of the abelian dominance established in numerical studies of mag .",
    "effects of the finite volume and incomplete gauge fixing should be further investigated .",
