    "non - hermitian hamiltonian models are often encountered in a wide class of quantum and classical systems @xcite .",
    "they are introduced , for example , to model open systems and dissipative phenomena in quantum mechanics ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in optics ,",
    "non - hermitian models naturally arise owing to the presence of optical gain and loss regions in dielectric or metal - dielectric structures @xcite . a special class of non - hermitian hamiltonians is provided by complex potentials having parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry @xcite , that is invariance under simultaneous parity transform ( @xmath1 : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for momentum and position operators , respectively ) and time reversal ( @xmath6 : @xmath2 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "an important property of @xmath0 hamiltonians is to admit of an entirely real - valued energy spectrum below a phase transition symmetry - breaking point , a property that attracted great attention in earlier studies on the subject owing to the possibility to formulate a consistent quantum mechanical theory in a non - hermitian framework @xcite . indeed , @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians are a special case of pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians , which can be mapped into hermitian ones @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians have found interest and applications in several physical fields , including magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite , quantum - field - theories @xcite , and electronics @xcite .",
    "more recently , great efforts have been devoted to the study and the experimental implementation of optical structures possessing @xmath0 symmetry ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the huge interest raised by the introduction of @xmath0 optical media is mainly motivated by their rather unique properties to mold the flow of light in non - conventional ways , with the possibility to observe , for example , double refraction and nonreciprocal diffraction patterns @xcite , unidirectional bragg scattering and invisibility @xcite , non - reciprocity @xcite , giant goos - hnchen shift @xcite , and simultaneous perfect absorption and laser behaviour @xcite .",
    "so far , @xmath0 quantum and classical systems have been mainly investigated in the unbroken @xmath0 phase , where the energies are real - valued , or at the symmetry breaking point , where exceptional points or spectral singularities appear in the underlying hamiltonian ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in the broken @xmath0 phase ,",
    "complex - conjugate energies appear . in the context of spatially - extended dissipative dynamical systems and hydrodynamic flows @xcite , breaking of the @xmath0 phase",
    "indicates a bifurcation from a marginally - stable phase to an unstable phase .",
    "this means that , while an initially localized wave packet can not secularly grow in the unbroken @xmath0 phase , it does in the broken @xmath0 phase owing to the emergence of modes with complex energies . in hydrodynamics ,",
    "an unstable open flow can be classified as either _ absolutely _ or _",
    "convectively _ unstable @xcite .",
    "a one - dimensional flow described by an order parameter @xmath9 is unstable if , for any given localized perturbation @xmath10 at initial time @xmath11 , @xmath12 as @xmath13 along at least one ray @xmath14 .",
    "the instability is said to be absolute if @xmath12 along the ray @xmath15 , whereas it is convective if @xmath16 along the ray @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "physically , in the convectively unstable regime the initial perturbation grows when observed along the trajectory @xmath17 at some drift velocity @xmath18 , whereas it decays when observed at a fixed position .",
    "convectively unstable flows generally arise in the presence of an advective ( drift ) term in the system , in such a way that the growing perturbation drifts in the laboratory reference frame and eventually escapes from the system .",
    "originally introduced in hydrodynamic contexts , the concepts of convective and absolute instabilities have found interest and applications in other physical fields , for example in the study of dissipative optical patterns and noise - sustained structures in nonlinear optics @xcite .    inspired by the properties of hydrodynamic unstable flows @xcite , in this work we introduce the concepts of convective and absolute @xmath0 symmetry breaking for spatially - extended hamiltonian systems .",
    "specifically , we investigate the symmetry - breaking properties of a tight - binding lattice model with spatially - extended alternating gain and loss regions , and show that the presence of an advective term can change the symmetry breaking from absolute to convective . the lattice model that we consider is a non - hermitian extension of the famous rice - mele hamiltonian , originally introduced to model conjugated diatomic polymers @xcite . in the convectively @xmath0 symmetry breaking regime ,",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry can be restored when the gain / loss region becomes spatially confined .",
    "a physical implementation of the non - hermitian rice - mele lattice model is proposed using arrays of coupled optical waveguides in a zig - zag geometry with periodically - bent axis and alternating optical gain and loss .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii the rice - mele tight - binding lattice model with non - hermitian and advective terms is presented , and a physical implementation based on light transport in arrays of coupled optical waveguides is suggested . in sec.iii",
    "the concepts of absolute and convective @xmath0 symmetry breaking are introduced for periodic potentials , and the transition from absolute to convective symmetry breaking for the rice - mele lattice model is studied by application of asymptotic ( saddle point ) methods .",
    "the concepts of convective and absolute symmetry breaking are also discussed for ac - dc driven lattice models , where the quasi - energy bands . in sec.iv the main conclusions and future developments are outlined .",
    "finally , in two appendixes some technical details on floquet analysis of the ac - dc driven lattice model and saddle point calculations for the rice - mele hamiltonian are presented .",
    "we consider transport of classical or quantum waves on a @xmath0-invariant tight - binding dimerized superlattice with nearest and next - nearest neighborhood hopping schematically shown in fig.1(a ) .",

    "the lattice hamiltonian ( 3 ) is invariant under simultaneous parity transformation and time reversal , and can be regarded as a non - hermitian extension of the rice - mele hamiltonian @xcite , originally introduced to model conjugated diatomic polymers @xcite and found in other physical systems as well , for example in cold atoms moving in one - dimensional optical superlattices @xcite .",
    "a possible physical implementation of this hamiltonian will be discussed in the following subsection .",
    "we note that tight - binding lattice models with non - hermitian terms have been introduced and studied in several recent works @xcite .",
    "in particular , the limiting case @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the hamiltonian ( 3 ) was previously considered in refs.@xcite , where for the infinitely - extended system @xmath0 symmetry breaking was shown to occur at @xmath40 . as discussed in the next section ,",
    "this kind of @xmath0 symmetry breaking is always absolute .",
    "+ for the general case @xmath41 and @xmath23 , the onset of @xmath0 symmetry breaking can be readily determined by analytical calculation of the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian ( 3 ) . to this aim ,",
    "let us search for a solution to eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) in the form of bloch - floquet states @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the quasi - momentum , which is assumed to vary in the interval @xmath44 , and @xmath45 the corresponding energy .",
    "substitution of the ansatz ( 4 ) into eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) yields the following homogeneous linear system for the complex amplitudes @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 a + [ \\kappa + \\sigma \\exp(-iq ) ] b & = & 0 \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ \\kappa+\\sigma \\exp(iq ) \\right ] a+ \\left [ e+2 \\rho \\cos ( q+\\varphi ) + ig \\right ]   b & = & 0   \\;\\;\\;\\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is solvable provided that the determinantal equation @xmath49 is satisfied .",
    "this yields the following dispersion relations @xmath50 for the two superlattice minibands @xmath51 and the following expressions for the amplitudes @xmath52 , @xmath53 of bloch - floquet eigenmodes @xmath54 from eq.(7 ) it follows that the energy spectrum is entirely real - valued for @xmath55 with @xmath56 . in this case , corresponding to the unbroken @xmath0 phase , the energy spectrum comprises two minibands which do not cross . in particular , at @xmath57",
    "the two minibands are separated by an energy gap of width @xmath58 . as @xmath59 the gap at @xmath60 shrinks and the two minibands touch at @xmath57 ; as @xmath34 overcomes @xmath61 , complex - conjugate energies appear near @xmath57 , which is the signature of @xmath0 symmetry breaking ; see fig.2 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the group velocity @xmath62 of bloch modes near @xmath60 at the symmetry breaking point , defined by @xmath63 , is given by @xmath64 which does not vanish provided that @xmath23 , i.e. in the presence of next - nearest neighborhood hopping , and @xmath65 .",
    "as it will be shown in sec.iii.b , a non - vanishing and sufficiently large group velocity can cause the @xmath0 symmetry breaking to change from absolute to convective .          before discussing the nature of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking for the extended non - hermitian rice - mele hamiltonian ( 3 ) ,",
    "it is worth suggesting possible physical implementations of this model . to realize the hamiltonian ( 3 ) , in addition to",
    "the non - hermitian ( gain and loss ) terms one needs to implement next - nearest neighborhood hoppings with controlled phase @xmath33 . rather generally , tight - binding lattice models with controlled phase of hopping rates can be realized by combined ac - dc forcing .",
    "here we briefly propose a photonic realization of the extended rice - mele model , based on light transport in a superlattice of evanescently - coupled optical waveguides .",
    "the rice - mele hamiltonian ( 3 ) can be basically obtained as a limiting case of an ac - driven tight - binding lattice at high modulation frequencies .",
    "another possible physical system where the combined ac - dc driven lattice model could be implemented is provided by cold atoms trapped in optical superlattices @xcite , where gain is introduced via atom injection at alternating sites @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of several theoretical proposals , experimental realizations of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians using ultracold atoms is still missing , and hence we limit here to briefly discuss the photonic system . the optical structure that we consider is shown in fig.1(b ) and is basically composed by a sequence of evanescently - coupled optical waveguides in a zig - zag geometry with alternating optical amplification ( gain ) and loss .",
    "the waveguides are displaced in the horizontal ( @xmath29 ) and vertical ( @xmath30 ) directions by the distances @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . in the zig - zag geometry ,",
    "non - negligible evanescent coupling occurs for nearest and next - nearest waveguides @xcite , with coupling constants ( hopping rates ) @xmath68 , @xmath69 for adjacent guides and @xmath70 for next - nearest guides , as indicated in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the values of the coupling constants @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are determined by certain overlapping integrals of the optical modes trapped in the waveguides , and they are usually exponentially - decaying functions of waveguide separation . for dielectric waveguides ,",
    "the coupling constants take real and positive values .",
    "the difference of couplings @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be controlled by changing the horizontal ( @xmath66 ) and vertical ( @xmath67 ) distances of waveguides , with @xmath39 for @xmath71 . for straight waveguides , the array of fig.1(b ) thus realizes the extended rice - mele model of fig.1(a ) with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "arrays of waveguides with arbitrarily curved axis in three - dimensions can be realized , for example , by the technique of femtosecond laser writing in optical glasses ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in the tight - binding and paraxial approximations , light transport in the superlattice with a bent axis",

    "note also that , in the absence of axis bending , i.e. for @xmath85 , eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) reproduce the extended rice - mele model [ eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) ] with @xmath75 .",
    "the equivalence of the driven lattice model [ eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) ] with the static rice - mele lattice model [ eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) ] with @xmath76 can be established as follows .",

    "we present the rather general definition of convective and absolute @xmath0 symmetry breaking for a continuous system in one spatial dimension @xmath29 , described by a @xmath0-invariant hamiltonian @xmath113 with a potential @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the real and imaginary parts of the potential and @xmath117 is a real - valued parameter that measures the strength of the non - hermitian part of the potential .",

    "the physics behind the definition of absolute and convective unstable flows is rather simple and is visualized in fig.3 . in the convectively unstable regime , an initial wave packet ( perturbation ) drifts in the laboratory reference frame with some velocity @xmath18 , and along the ray @xmath17 , i.e. in the reference frame moving with the wave packet , the perturbation secularly grows with time .",

    "an important physical implication of the convective ( rather than absolute ) @xmath0 symmetry breaking is that the unbroken @xmath0 phase can be restored in the convectively regime by making the region of alternating gain and loss sites in the lattice _ spatially limited _ rather than extended .",

    "the numerical results are obtained by solving the coupled - mode equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) using an accurate fourth - order variable - step runge - kutta method assuming as an initial condition a gaussian wave packet with carrier wave number @xmath178 at lattice sites @xmath95 solely , namely @xmath203 $ ] and @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the size of the wave packet .",
    "such an initial condition mainly excites ( unstable ) bloch - floquet modes with imaginary energy at wave numbers @xmath43 close to the most critical one @xmath206 .",

    "in fact , while the wave packet @xmath214 secularly grows along the ray @xmath215 , it decays when observed at a fixed spatial position ( e.g. @xmath171 ) , as shown in the lower panel of fig.4(a ) .",

    "according to the theoretical analysis , in the high modulation regime the quasi - energy spectrum of the driven lattice asymptotically reproduces the spectrum of the static rice - mele model [ compare fig.5(c ) and ( d ) ] . at low or moderate values of the modulation frequency @xmath91 , deviations from the two models can be clearly appreciated [ compare figs.5(a ) and ( b ) with fig.5(d ) ] . in particular",
    ", the driven lattice model at low modulation frequencies shows a wider range of wave numbers with complex energies , and the real part of the quasi energies for the two minibands are not degenerate . nevertheless , the transition from convective to absolute symmetry breaking , which is basically related to the value of the group velocity ( the derivative of the real part of the quasi - energy ) of the unstable mode at the symmetry breaking point , can be observed even at moderate modulation frequencies .",
    "this is shown , as an example , in fig.6 , where we depict the numerically - computed evolution of the same initial gaussian wave packet as in fig.4 but in the ac - dc driven lattice for a modulation frequency @xmath195 and for @xmath221 [ fig.6(a ) ] , corresponding to a convective symmetry breaking , and @xmath225 [ fig.6(b ) ] , corresponding to absolute @xmath0 symmetry breaking .    , and ( b ) @xmath226 , @xmath209 .",
    "the other parameter values are : @xmath207 and @xmath227 . for the sake of clearness the imaginary part of the energies ( square points )",
    "are multiplied by a factor of 2 .",
    "the total number of unit cells of the lattice is @xmath228 , and the eigenvalues are ordered for increasing values of the real part of the energy .",
    "the number of dimers with loss and gain is @xmath229 , and they are located at the center of the lattice.,width=313 ]    as a final comment , it is worth discussing a physically relevant implication of convective versus absolute @xmath0 symmetry breaking . in the convectively unstable regime , the growing wave packet drifts in the laboratory reference frame fast enough that locally ( i.e. at a fixed spatial position ) it is observed to decay in spite of its growth in a moving reference frame ( see figs.3 and 4 ) .",
    "let us now consider a lattice with a spatially confined ( rather than infinitely extended ) region of unit cells with gain and loss . in the convective regime , advection pushes the wave packet far from the `` non - hermitian '' region of the lattice , and hence after a transient the wave packet ceases to grow .",
    "conversely , in the absolute symmetry breaking regime it is expected to grow indefinitely even for a spatially - finite extension of unit cells with gain and loss .",
    "such a simple physical picture suggests that in the convectively unstable regime @xmath0 symmetry ( i.e. an entirely real - valued energy spectrum ) may be restored when the gain / loss region in the lattice is spatially limited .",
    "we checked such a prediction by considering the rice - mele lattice hamiltonian ( 3 ) with a spatially - dependent gain / loss term vanishing at infinity , namely @xmath230 \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\\\ & + & i \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}g_n   \\left ( \\hat{a}_n^{\\dag } \\hat{a}_{n}-\\hat{b}_n^{\\dag } \\hat{b}_{n } \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath231 as @xmath232 .",
    "in particular , we numerically computed the energy spectrum of @xmath118 by considering a square - wave profile of @xmath233 , i.e. @xmath234 for @xmath235 and @xmath236 otherwise .",
    "this case corresponds to a central lattice section comprising @xmath237 dimers with gain and loss ( i.e. locally non - hermitian ) , and and abrupt transition to two outer lattice sections with locally - hermitian dimers ( i.e. @xmath236 ) . in the numerical simulations , the total number of unit cells @xmath238 is finite , corresponding to truncation of the outer lattice sections . as an example , in fig.7 we show the numerically - computed energies of the truncated lattice described by the hamiltonian @xmath239 \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\\\ & + & ig \\sum_{n =- n_g/2}^{n_g/2 } \\left ( \\hat{a}_n^{\\dag } \\hat{a}_{n}-\\hat{b}_n^{\\dag } \\hat{b}_{n } \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath240 , @xmath241 and for parameter values corresponding to absolute [ fig.7(a ) ] and convective [ fig.7(b ) ] @xmath0 symmetry breaking in the extended ( i.e. @xmath242 ) limit .",
    "note that , within numerical accuracy , the energy spectrum is entirely real - valued in the convective regime [ fig.7(b ) ] , whereas pairs of complex - conjugate energies persist in the absolute regime [ fig.7(a ) ] .",
    "it should be noted , however , that restoring of the @xmath0 symmetry in the convective regime is not a strict rule , since the interfaces from the outer lattice regions to the inner ( non - hermitian ) lattice section might sustain localized ( interface ) modes with imaginary energies , which can not be predicted by our simple picture .",
    "moreover , it is expected that restoring of the @xmath0 symmetry depends on the choice of the profile @xmath233 ; for example a smooth ( rather than sharp ) transition from the inner ( locally non - hermitian ) to the outer ( locally hermitian ) regions is expected to avoid the appearance of interface states .",
    "symmetry breaking in case of inhomogeneous gain / loss parameter @xmath233 would require a further study , however this goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in this work we have introduced the concepts of convective and absolute @xmath0 symmetry breaking for wave transport in periodic complex potentials , inspired by the hydrodynamic concepts of convective and absolute instabilities in open flows . in particular ,",
    "we have investigated analytically and numerically the transition from absolute to convective @xmath0 symmetry breaking in two tight - binding lattice models : a non - hermitian extension of the rice - mele dimerized lattice , originally introduced to model conjugated diatomic polymers , and an ac - dc driven lattice , which reproduces the rice - mele model in the large modulation frequency limit . in the context of spatially - extended dissipative dynamical systems , @xmath0 symmetry breaking can be viewed as a phase transition from a marginally stable state ( the unbroken @xmath0 phase ) to an unstable state ( the broken @xmath0 phase ) . the instability arises because of the appearance of pairs of complex - conjugate energies in the broken @xmath0 phase .",
    "the distinction between convective and absolute @xmath0 symmetry breaking arises when considering the evolution of a wave packet in the broken @xmath0 phase : while in the absolute symmetry breaking case the wave packet amplitude observed at a fixed spatial position secularly grows in time , in the convective symmetry breaking case the amplitude grows in a reference frame moving at some drift velocity , however it decays when observed at a fixed spatial position , i.e. for an observer at rest .",
    "a convective regime is generally found when the unstable modes have a group ( drift ) velocity large enough that at a fixed spatial position the wave packet decay due to the drift overcomes the growth due to the instability .",
    "the nature ( either absolute or convective ) of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking is basically determined by the sign of the imaginary part of the energy ( for static lattices ) or quasi - energy ( for periodically - driven lattices ) at the dominant band saddle point in complex plane .",
    "an interesting application of the concepts of convective and absolute symmetry breaking is found when considering a spatially - limited region of gain / loss in the system , i.e when the periodicity of the system is broken and the imaginary part of the potential is confined to a limited region of space .",
    "owing to the fast drift of a wave packet in the convective regime , after a transient the wave packet escapes from the imaginary potential region and thus it ceases to grow .",
    "this means that the instability is only transient , i.e. we expect that @xmath0 symmetry is restored in the convective regime when the imaginary potential is spatially confined .",
    "this is not the case of the absolute symmetry breaking regime , where the broken @xmath0 phase is expected to persist even for a spatially - limited imaginary potential .",
    "other possible applications and developments of the hydrodynamic concepts of convective and absolute instabilities can be foreseen into the rapidly growing field of wave transport in @xmath0-symmetric quantum and classical systems .",
    "for example , like for hydrodynamic and dissipative optical systems @xcite , interesting effects ( like the appearance of noise - sustained structures @xcite ) might be envisaged for convective @xmath0 symmetry breaking in presence of classical or quantum noise @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the onset of parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry breaking in non - hermitian tight - binding lattices with spatially - extended loss / gain regions in presence of an advective term . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the instability properties of hydrodynamic open flows , it is shown that @xmath0 symmetry breaking can be either absolute or convective . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> , an initially - localized wave packet shows a secular growth with time at any given spatial position , whereas in the latter case the growth is observed in a reference frame moving at some drift velocity while decay occurs at any fixed spatial position . in the convective unstable regime , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 symmetry is restored when the spatial region of gain / loss in the lattice is limited ( rather than extended ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider specifically a non - hermitian extension of the rice - mele tight binding lattice model , and show the existence of a transition from absolute to convective symmetry breaking when the advective term is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of the analysis to ac - dc - driven lattices is also presented , and an optical implementation of the non - hermitian rice - mele model is suggested , which is based on light transport in an array of evanescently - coupled optical waveguides with a periodically - bent axis and alternating regions of optical gain and loss . </S>"
