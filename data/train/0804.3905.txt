    "a general question of interest is how a non - integral valence of localized ions in a solid influences the possibility of magnetic order . concerning this subject ,",
    "an earlier paper reported the anomalous valence state of eu in eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 was characterized to show intermediate - valent and probably also covalent properties .",
    "a coexistence of a non - integral eu valence of 2.2 and antiferromagnetic order up to 50 k was reported .",
    "simply given , a non - integral valence means that the mean total occupation number of the ionic electronic levels is non - integral .",
    "this might have several physical reasons .",
    "in particular , _ intermediate valence _ is the hybridization of localized ionic states with the strongly _",
    "delocalized _ conduction band .",
    "it is experimentally evident and theoretically well - understood that there is a strong competition between intermediate valence and magnetic order .",
    "intermediate valence is known to suppress magnetic ordering temperatures typically to at most a _",
    "few _ k. as an experimental example , tmse is intermediate - valent and has a n@xmath2el temperature below 3.5 k. @xcite    a detailed theoretical approach to intermediate valence is the extended s - f model .",
    "@xcite using this model a similarity to the kondo effect is shown : grossly spoken , information about the electron spin is washed out by the delocalization of the conduction band states .",
    "the extended s - f model allows one to take a ferromagnetic exchange between ionic f and conducting s states into account , which is typical for intermediate - valent eu ions .",
    "hence , it is more realistic than an anderson model , which always implies an antiferromagnetic s - f coupling .",
    "@xcite    in agreement with experiment , the extended s - f model also explains why the magnetic ordering temperature of an intermediate - valent system is enhanced drastically by mechanical or chemical high pressure .",
    "in addition , a given intermediate valence is pressure - sensitive itself because the energy levels of the localized states can be pressed towards the conduction band .",
    "these aspects are not too important for the present paper because we will concentrate neither on intermediate valence nor on anomalous pressure .",
    "if a non - integral valence is caused by _ covalence , no strongly delocalized states _ are involved in the underlying hybridization .",
    "hence , a characteristically different approach will be required to understand such systems .",
    "the interpretation of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 is insufficient so far . on the one hand , if eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 was a system in which a eu intermediate valence of 2.2 and magnetic order coexist up to 50 k without any restrictions , this would mean a small sensation .",
    "not only was such a behaviour experimentally unusual but also theoretically not understood , because in this case the ordering temperature was an order of magnitude higher than for typically realistic parameter sets of the extended s - f model .",
    "@xcite even for extreme choices of the model parameters ( in case of a eu intermediate valence of 2.2 ) , an upper boundary of about 15 k for the ordering temperature is estimated .",
    "a new concept of intermediate valence would have to be found to explain the experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "no detailed model is available to investigate the counter - perspective , the influence of the covalence on the magnetism of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 .    in the following",
    ", we will motivate the use of a covalent scenario _",
    "instead _ of intermediate valence as the starting - point for the investigation of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "this is in contrast to former publications @xcite and also refers to unpublished experimental material .",
    "@xcite      we take into account the following experiments on eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 : measurements of the magnetic susceptibility , @xcite of the crystal structure , @xcite l@xmath3 x - ray absorption , @xcite and mbauer spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite    the properties of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 can be unraveled by studying the influences of temperature and doping , especially with as .",
    "depending on these two parameters , in experiments a structural phase transition of first order is observed whereas the lattice type , a body - centered tetragonal thcr@xmath0si@xmath4 structure ( figure [ crstruc ] ) , does not change .",
    "p@xmath1.,width=264 ]    the structural phases @xmath5 and @xmath6 differ by a strongly anisotropic jump of the lattice parameters and by the electronic bonding conditions .",
    "this leads in the @xmath6 phase to a non - integral eu valence of 2.2 .",
    "the lattice cells show a slight elongation in the square plane but a considerable compression along the tetragonal axis @xcite compared to the @xmath5 phase , which contains divalent eu ions . in both phases , the valence is homogeneous , i.e. , all eu ions are equivalent .    in the @xmath6 modification",
    "two nearest neighbouring p atoms form a single molecular bond @xcite  oriented along the tetragonal axis  which does not appear in the @xmath5 phase .",
    "that corresponds to a charge transfer from the phosphorus to the conduction band , which leaves holes in p@xmath1 molecular states .",
    "these are available for occupation by one fluctuating eu electron each . in this way , in the @xmath6 phase",
    "there is a covalent hybridization between the magnetic eu ions and p@xmath1 molecules .",
    "the rh ions do not participate in the magnetic properties of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 .    both phases @xmath5 and @xmath6 exhibit a magnetic phase transition from para- to antiferromagnetism at a n@xmath2el temperature @xmath7 ( phase diagram : figure 2 ) .",
    "with decreasing as doping @xmath7 drops somewhat at the @xmath5-@xmath6 phase boundary but does not change its order of magnitude .",
    "according to the extended s - f model this effect of the valence transition on the ordering temperature is too small to be consistent with intermediate valence .    the valence measurements on eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 , in particular l@xmath3 x - ray absorption and mbauer spectroscopy , can not distinguish between a non - integral valence of covalent and intermediate - valent origin .",
    "the reduced magnetic moment of the @xmath6 phase compared to the divalent eu moment of the @xmath5 phase does not clarify the nature of the non - integral valence either .",
    "furthermore , the valence can not be derived from the magnetic eu moment alone because in the non intermediate - valent case a non - trivial contribution by the p@xmath1 states must be considered .",
    "this quantity is unknown .",
    "the covalent bonding scenario between eu and p@xmath1 states persued in the present paper was derived in reference from bonding lengths and is supported by further aspects .",
    "in particular , the pressure dependence @xcite of the valence , which we express as the deviation @xmath8 from the divalent state , leads to the conclusion that the intermediate - valent part of the total eu valence amounts to at most @xmath9    this is the precision with which the eu valence is determined by mbauer spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite reference states _ no _ intermediate valence within this precision because in mbauer spectroscopy the eu valence does not change over the range between ambient pressure and 5 gpa .",
    "this is the expectation in absence of a conduction band hybridization .    as the results of l@xmath3 x - ray absorption @xcite may be influenced by final - state effects , we assume an error bar for the non - integral eu valence of the @xmath6 phase including intermediate valence as well as covalence and estimate the valence shift as : @xmath10    we will not carry out an error calculation in closed form but will select several discrete values for parameters of the model , which will be constituted neglecting @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , we ignore the weak temperature dependence of the valence which is considerably less significant in the @xmath6 phase than the precision of 0.05 .",
    "@xcite    the mechanism and the geometric structure of _ magnetic ordering _ in eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 are almost completely unknown .",
    "experimentally , antiferromagnetism below @xmath7 has been concluded , as well as the existence of  unspecified  ferromagnetic couplings because of an anomalous paramagnetic curie temperature .",
    "@xcite in addition , the importance of a phosphorus - mediated superexchange between the eu ions has been shown qualitatively via the sensitivity of the mbauer magnetic hyperfine field ( and @xmath7 ) to pressure , @xcite which is not observed in the reference system eurh@xmath0as@xmath4 .    as@xmath12p@xmath13 .",
    "@xcite the mid - grey sector corresponds to a coexistence due to hysteresis.,width=264 ]    we conclude that the covalence of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 has to be significant because the intermediate - valent part is small and the reduced magnetic moment , the existence of the superexchange , and the bonding scenario have been shown to be mutually consistent with the covalence .",
    "a possibility other than covalence or intermediate valence which can cause a measured non - integral valence should be excluded in eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 : in eu@xmath14pd@xmath15au@xmath16si@xmath17 similar l@xmath3 x - ray absorption and mbauer results in spite of a _ divalent _ magnetic eu moment are found at ambient pressure and are explained finally by an anomalous spatial extension of the 4f shell , whereas the system becomes intermediate - valent under high pressure . @xcite",
    "in contrast to eurh@xmath0p@xmath0 , in eu@xmath14pd@xmath15au@xmath16si@xmath17 no covalent bonding partners are available for the eu ions .    under pressure beyond 5 gpa , intermediate valence in eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 acquires , at least qualitatively , the same relevance as the covalence but stays less important than the latter at ambient pressure .",
    "@xcite the corresponding characteristic decrease of @xmath7 under increasing pressure is understood by the extended s - f model .",
    "band structure calculations of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 have only been performed for the integral - valent @xmath5 ( high temperature ) phase .",
    "@xcite    the magnetic ordering of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 is caused both by super- and indirect exchange .",
    "the latter aspect follows because the reference system eurh@xmath0as@xmath4 exhibits almost the same @xmath7 ( 48k ) but neither superexchange @xcite nor an anomaly of the paramagnetic curie temperature .",
    "@xcite    in order to treat the covalence effects of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 perturbatively from divalent ionic ground states we view the crystal as built by inactive two - dimensional metallic rh planes and by quasi - two - dimensional insulating eup@xmath1 planes .",
    "the covalent hybridization in these planes is much more important than the one between different eup@xmath1 planes .",
    "this is concluded from the eu - p distances , which in the @xmath6 phase near the phase boundary are : 3.88  between the planes and 3.10  in the plane .",
    "as the starting - point we view the properties of an arbitrary single eu ion in interaction with the four neighbouring p@xmath1 molecular ions which form a tetragonal cage around it .",
    "this interaction describes the high - temperature paramagnetism of the crystal to leading order .",
    "we begin with three unknown model parameters and reduce their number finally to one after calculating two quantities for which experimental values are available : the valence and the paramagnetic susceptibility ( as an avarage over the three spatial directions ) .",
    "we also calculate the single - ion anisotropies of the eu ions , which are experimentally unknown .    using the same model parameters , since thermal expansion is very small in the temperature range between 0 and about 400 k , @xcite we calculate the superexchange parameters between nearest and next - nearest neighbouring eu ions .",

    "we have introduced a systematic interpretation of the eu valence shift and the magnetism of eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 due to covalent bonding which  in contrast to a hypothetically given intermediate valence  is consistent with experiment .",
    "we have presented a model for the covalence which predicts upper bounds of the anisotropy of the curie constants and which characterizes the strength of the eu single - ion anisotropies and of the superexchange coupling between nearest and next - nearest neighbouring eu ions . though a quantitative calculation of the magnetic ordering temperature has not been possible , we have argued why the experimentally observed ordering temperature is generic , because for instance the single - ion anisotropies might have considerable strength .",
    "measurements of the anisotropy of the curie constants could fix the last free parameter @xmath93 of the single - ion anisotropy and superexchange model and determine the model completely . following that , measurements of the magnetic structure and the magnetic excitations via neutron scattering could make a description possible which also takes into account indirect exchange between the eu ions .",
    "( the reader should be reminded that neutron scattering requires the particularly expensive isotope eu-153 because the standard isotope eu-151 absorbs neutrons too strongly .",
    "@xcite ) in this way , there is the chance to understand the ordering mechanism in eurh@xmath0p@xmath1 comprehensively .",
