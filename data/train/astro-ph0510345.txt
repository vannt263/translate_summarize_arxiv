    "_ planck _ is a european space agency satellite designed to produce high - resolution temperature and polarisation maps of the cmb .",
    "it is equipped with detectors sensitive to a wide range of frequencies from 30 to 857 ghz , split between two instruments , hfi and lfi , the high and low frequency instruments , respectively . the full - sky coverage and frequency range provided by _ planck",
    "_ will also enable the construction of a unique compact source catalogue .",
    "below 100  ghz it will be a significant improvement over that of wmap , ( @xcite ) , in terms of sensitivity and hence in the number of sources detected , while above 100  ghz it will be the only full - sky survey for many years to come .",
    "this paper investigates the possiblity of recovering the geometric - calibration parameters , defined in section  [ geocal_param ] , as part of the initial stages of the construction of this source catalogue .",
    "previous work , ( @xcite ) , on the reconstruction of the geometric - calibration parameters concentrated on the recovery of the boresight and roll angle parameters during the course of the mission ; the recovery of the reference phase was not discussed , nor has it been discussed elsewhere . while the monitoring and evaluation of these parameters is crucial over the lifetime of the mission , it is expected that much higher accuracies are achievable with an a posteriori evaluation of these parameters using the entirety of the mission data .",
    "hence it is expected that the construction of the final compact source catalogue , fcsc , will provide the definitive values of the geometric - calibration parameters .",
    "an overview of the fcsc is presented in section  [ overview_fcsc ] .",
    "the geometric - calibration parameters are defined in section  [ geocal ] , together with a discussion on their use in the pointing reconstruction of the _ planck _ field - of - view and the accuracy requirements of the pointing reconstruction are assessed .",
    "the simulations generated to assess the performance of the geometric - calibration methods , outlined in section  [ methods_section ] , are discussed in section  [ simul_section ] .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in section  [ results_section ] , where we show that it is possible to recover these parameters to the required accuracies using solely the bright extragalactic point sources , provided there is only a slow linear variation in the value of these parameters over the course of the mission .",
    "the final compact source catalogue , fcsc , should not be confused with the early release compact source catalogue , ercsc .",
    "the ercsc will be released approximately 1 year after the start of the routine observations .",
    "its primary purpose being to allow rapid follow - up observations from herschel and ground - based millimetre instruments .",
    "this catalogue will be produced using the frequency - channel maps from the data corresponding to the first full - sky coverage , this is expected to be the first @xmath0 7 months worth of data .",
    "the requirement on the release date , however , curtails the focus of the ercsc to the brightest sources .",
    "further details of the ercsc implementation plan may be found in @xcite .",
    "the fcsc will comprise of the full mission data for _ planck _ and be a significant improvement over the ercsc .",
    "the primary goal in the construction of the fcsc is to ensure the internal consistency and accuracy of the catalogue and final frequency maps .",
    "this goal has motivated the division of the catalogue construction into four major stages .    1 .",
    "stage 1a : the accumulation of the detections from bright point sources in the ring data , where the ring data corresponds to a single spin axis positioning , is used to find positions for these point sources and any deviations from the current bestfit values for the geometric - calibration parameters .",
    "it is this stage which forms the main focus of this paper .",
    "2 .   stage 1b : solar system objects with their highly accurate positional data also allow the recovery of the geometric - calibration parameters .",
    "given the relative motion of these bodies and the _ planck _ satellite the methods employed are some what different from those in stage  1a .",
    "hence the discussion of the methods used in stage  1b is reserved for paper  ii , _ the geometric calibration of the planck satellite using solar system objects _ 3 .",
    "stage 2 & 3 : these stages involve the treatment of the intermediate - source detections on rings and the source detections in maps , respectively .",
    "it is envisaged that for the source detections from maps , it may be necessary to return to the ring data to ensure that maximum accuracy and consistency will be attained .",
    "the discussion of the methods involved in these stages of construction is left to paper  iii , on the final compact source catalogue",
    "_ planck _ will be inserted into a lissajous orbit around the second lagrange point of the earth - sun system , spinning about its axis once per minute .",
    "the line of sight being almost perpendicular to the spin axis , hence the detectors will almost follow a great circle .",
    "the spin axis will nominally be repositioned every hour , and the roughly 60 or so circles corresponding to a single spin axis positioning may be binned together to form a ring .",
    "the nominal spin axis passes through the centre of the solar panels and is directed away from the sun , thus maintaining the rest of the satellite in a cone of shadow produced by the solar panels .",
    "the scanning strategy is determined by the sequence of the nominal positions of the spin axis over the course of the mission .",
    "the geometric calibration is the process whereby all the line - of - sight positions of the detectors are recovered , at any time during the observations .",
    "the relationship between the pointing and time may depend on multiple parameters , discussed in full in @xcite ; the star tracker will provide many of these parameters .",
    "however , as will be discussed in section  [ pointingrecon ] , there is an uncertainty between the line - of - sight of the star tracker and that of the focal plane , this will produce offsets in the values of a few of the geometric - calibration parameters .",
    "these offsets may only be recovered with the science data , and it is those geometric - calibration parameters which require this calibration with the science data that we discuss here .",
    "( 10,8)(0,0 ) ( -1.5,10 )    the position of the line - of - sight of a detector with respect to the spin axis position may be described in terms of two angles , which are shown in figure  [ los_fig ] .",
    "the first , the opening angle , is the angle between the spin axis position and the line - of - sight of the detector .",
    "the opening angle defines the path described by the detector , the scan circle .",
    "the second angle , the phase , defines the position along the scan circle from a given reference point .",
    "this reference point may be given by the intersection point of the scan circle and the great circle connecting the spin axis position with the north ecliptic pole , nep .",
    "this great circle , shown in figure  [ los_fig ] , will be referred to as the reference meridian .",
    "each repositioning of the spin axis defines its own reference meridian .",
    "( 10,8)(0,0 ) ( -1.5,10 )    ( 8,8)(0,0 ) ( 8.85,0 )    if we assume the focal - plane geometry , as defined by the relative locations of the detectors to the position of a fiducial reference point , frp , defined somewhere central in the focal plane , remains fixed , then instead of requiring two angles per detector we may describe the positions of all the detectors in terms of just three angles .",
    "these three angles , shown in figure  [ geo_fig ] , are the opening angle to the frp , otherwise known as the boresight angle , @xmath1 , the phase @xmath2 of the frp , determined from the reference phase , @xmath3 , as measured from the reference point defined by the reference meridian , and the roll angle , @xmath4 , which is given by the rotation of the focal plane around the frp , relative to a nominal scan direction defined within the focal - plane geometry , as illustrated in figure  [ roll_fig ] .",
    "the position of the line - of - sight of a detector may now be described in terms of the nominal values for these angles , the phase of the @xmath5 detector is given by : @xmath6 and similarly the opening angle to the detector by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively , the scan and cross - scan positions of the @xmath5 detector with respect to the frp and may be determined by the focal - plane layout and the roll angle .",
    "the scan and cross - scan positions of a detector for a given roll angle , @xmath4 , may be found using the position given for the detector in the focal plane , @xmath10 , which corresponds to the scan and cross - scan positions of the detector in the case of zero roll angle : @xmath11    the actual values of the geometric - calibration parameters , however , may deviate from their nominal values , as will be discussed in section  [ pointingrecon ] .",
    "it is therefore useful to express the offset in the phase , @xmath12 , and opening angle , @xmath13 , to a detector in terms the differences between the nominal and actual geometric - calibration parameters using equations  [ def_detphase_eqn ] to  [ rotation_eqn ] :    @xmath14    the dependence of the recovered position of the line - of - sight of a detector may now clearly be seen in equation  [ offset_dep_eqn ] ; the position along the scan is affected by the reference phase and the roll angle , whereas the position in the cross - scan direction is affected by boresight and roll angles .",
    "information on the scan - phase correction @xmath12 may be obtained from the measurements of @xmath15 for point - source transits .",
    "the correction to the opening angle @xmath13 may be derived from the distribution of intensities of the point - source transits .",
    "these corrections may be used to evaluate the offsets in the geometric - calibration parameters , this analysis is the subject of section  [ methods_section ] .",
    "( 10,8)(0,0 ) ( -0.25,0 )    the pointing reconstruction of the satellite is achieved by the recovery of the the relationship between the line - of - sight of the star tracker and that of the focal plane .",
    "it is helpful to define two reference frames for _ planck _ , the satellite reference system ( srs ) and the inertial reference system ( irs ) .",
    "the origin of both systems is the centre of gravity , cog , of the satellite .",
    "the srs is aligned with the principle axes of the satellite , and is shown in figure  [ planck_srs_fig ] .",
    "the @xmath16-axis is defined by the nominal spin axis which passes through the centre of the solar panels , and the cog , and is directed away from the sun .",
    "the @xmath17-axis is orthogonal to the @xmath16-axis and lies in the plane defined by the @xmath16-axis and the projected line - of - sight of the frp .",
    "the @xmath18-axis then completes this right - handed triad .",
    "it is necessary to define a second reference system , the inertial reference system , irs , in which the inertia tensor is diagonal .",
    "the @xmath16-axis is now the actual spin axis , which is defined by the largest principle axis as determined by the principle moments of inertia of the satellite .",
    "these two reference systems are connected by a time varing rotation matrix which must be recovered in flight .",
    "as the mission progresses and consumables are depleted this affects the inertia tensor of the satellite and hence the axis of rotation , changing the relationship between the srs and the irs . the star tracker should recover this time varing relationship .",
    "however , the exact relationship between the star tracker reference system and the srs is not known .",
    "this lack of an exact relation between the star tracker and the srs and irs will produce uncertainties in the reconstruction of the actual line - of - sights for the detectors .",
    "these uncertainties have been estimated to be @xmath0  1.3 arc - minutes , @xcite , and may be described in terms of offsets in the geometric - calibration parameters , which must be recovered from the science data in order to meet the accuracy requirements discussed in section  [ acc_reqments ] .    the relationships between the focal plane and the star tracker to the srs ,",
    "although nominally constant may indeed have a slow variation with time due to thermal effects .",
    "the offsets in the geometric - calibration parameters which must be established from the science data , may therefore be time dependent .",
    "additional time variation may arise if the star tracker fails to completely establish the time dependence between the srs and the irs .",
    "the expected magnitude of these effects are unknown , but are thought to be less than 1 arcmin .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the reference systems and the attitude analysis may be found in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ acc_fig ] was created in order to assess the accuracy to which the pointing must be recovered to avoid compromising the reconstruction of the @xmath19 power spectrum , which describes the magnitude of the fluctions in the cmb as a function of angular scale and is the primary science goal of the _ planck _ satellite . it shows the effect of unknown random pointing reconstruction errors on the recovered @xmath20 values .",
    "the solid grey curves correspond to the error on individual multipoles , whereas the dashed grey curves correspond to the error on multipole bins of 50 .",
    "the shape of the grey curve is determined at low multipoles , on the left of the figure , by the sample and cosmic variance . on the right at high multipoles , however , the error is due to noise and the finite size of the beam .",
    "the decrease in the sensitivity of the beam to the higher multipoles may be accounted for at the cost of the exponential increase in the noise at the high @xmath21 values ; as the noise is undiminished by the beam size .",
    "the series of black curves in figure  [ acc_fig ] show the effect of unknown random pointing reconstruction errors .",
    "the pointing uncertainties result in an effective smearing of the beam , resulting in a larger effective beam .",
    "this produces the reduction in the sensitivity to the higher multipoles , as seen in figure  [ acc_fig ] .",
    "a more detailed discussion of how this figure is obtained , may be found in @xcite .",
    "ideally , the errors in the reconstruction of the pointing should be such that the additional errors introduced are less than that of the unsubtractable noise .",
    "this places an upper limit on the total pointing error of 9  arcseconds .",
    "it should be noted that correlated errors in the pointing will not produce effects as large as those for pointing errors of the same magnitude which are random .",
    "the effect of smearing the beam predominately in one direction is to increase the sensitivity to higher @xmath21 multipoles as compared to the uniform smearing shown in figure  [ acc_fig ] .",
    "the pointing accuracy requirement generated by assuming unknown random pointing errors should therefore exceed any requirements found from assuming correlated errors , and will represent the tightest constraints on the pointing accuracy required .",
    "( 7,7)(0,0 ) ( 8.5,0 )",
    "as discussed in section  [ pointingrecon ] there will be an offset between the line - of - sight , los , as determined by the star tracker and the actual los .",
    "it is this offset which produces the systematic offsets between the actual and nominal values of the reference phase , boresight and roll angles , which may only be recovered using the science data .",
    "the methods for evaluating the geometric - calibration parameters therefore , need only assess the offset in the value of the parameters from their nominal values .",
    "these methods should also be able to cope with a slow variation in the values of these offsets over the course of the mission , due to thermal effects , as discussed in section  [ pointingrecon ] .",
    "these offsets must be recovered to accuracies which will allow the total pointing error to remain below 9 arcseconds , as discussed in section  [ acc_reqments ] .    as discussed in section  [ geocal_param ] , offsets in the reference phase and the boresight angle produce errors in the recovered position which are orthogonal , and hence may be solved for independently .",
    "the offset in the roll angle , however , produces errors in position , in both the scan and cross - scan directions . in practice",
    ", however , the roll angle may be solved together with the reference phase independently from the boresight angle , as will be discussed in section  [ methods_refphase ] .",
    "the calibration of the opening angles to the detectors and hence the boresight angle is discussed in section  [ methods_openang ] .",
    "the position of a point source in the scan direction may be constrained by the phase of the detection .",
    "detections on multiple non - parallel scans which correspond to the same point source , may therefore be used to constrain the position of the point source on the sky .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure  [ intersect_fig ] , where the solid arrows represent the scan directions .",
    "the position of the point source may be found from the intersection point of lines orthogonal to the scan direction extending from the phase of each detection .",
    "figure  [ intersect_fig ] shows these lines for the cases of no offsets in phase , dashed lines , and unreconstructed time dependent offsets , dotted lines . as seen in figure  [ intersect_fig ]",
    "any unaccounted for offset in phase will affect the recovered position of the point source .",
    "offsets in the opening angles to the detectors , however , will not affect the recovered position .",
    "offsets in the opening angles only affect the angular separation between the recovered position and the apparent position of the scan .",
    "the offsets in the phase of the detections , therefore , allow an offset in the roll angle to be discovered independently of an offset in the boresight angle .",
    "an offset in the roll angle is equivalent to a different reference phase offset for every detector , hence an offset in the reference phase may be distinguished from an offset in the roll angle .",
    "the minimisation of the residuals between the phase observed for the detection and the phase expected for the point source based on its recovered position , therefore provides a mechanism whereby the offset in the reference phase and roll angle may be assessed .",
    "the methods presented here are similar to those employed in the sphere reconstruction for the _ hipparcos _ satellite , @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "( 8.5,8.5)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    the residual phase , @xmath22 , for the @xmath23 detection corresponding to the @xmath24 point source , may now be defined as the difference between the expected phase for @xmath23 detection given the position of the @xmath24 point source , @xmath25 , and the observed phase of the detection , @xmath26 . @xmath27 the expected phase , @xmath25 ,",

    "the expected phase of the frp for the @xmath23 detection of the @xmath24 point source , @xmath30 , may be calculated using : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the spin axis position corresponding to the @xmath23 detection and @xmath33 is the position of the @xmath24 point source .",
    "an initial position for the @xmath24 point source , @xmath33 , may be found by minimimizing the residual phases for all the detections of the @xmath24 point source , hence solving : @xmath34 where the summation is over all the detections of the @xmath24 point source and @xmath35 is the residual in the phase of the @xmath23 detection which may be found using the relationship between small changes in the phase of a detection and the resultant change in position , @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the current value , at the time of the @xmath23 detection , of the opening angle to the detector in which the @xmath23 detection occurs , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the position of the detection .",
    "once an initial position for the @xmath24 point source has been found , the expected phase of the detection , @xmath25 , and hence the residual phase , @xmath22 , may be evaluated .",
    "the residual phase , however , may also be related to changes in the expected phase due to changes in the position of the @xmath24 point source , and the residuals in the phase of the detection , @xmath42 : @xmath43 using equation  [ offset_dep_eqn ] and under the assumption that the offset in the roll angle is small , @xmath42 may be expressed as : @xmath44 where the offsets in the reference phase and roll angle , may be expressed as a constant offset and a term defining the linear drift in time , @xmath45    equation  [ refphase_eqn ] may now be written in terms of changes to the point source position and the offsets in the reference phase and roll angle , using equations  [ del_phase_del_pos ] and equation  [ residphase_eqn ] .",
    "@xmath46    a similar equation may be written for every detection , giving @xmath47 equations and @xmath48 unknowns .",
    "the corrections to the point source positions and the values for the systematic offset and drift in the reference phase and roll angle may then be extracted by a nonlinear least squares analysis .      as discussed in section  [ geocal_param ] , the opening angle to a detector",
    "is given by the angle between the line - of - sight of the detector and the spin axis position .",
    "the opening angles to the detectors are determined by the focal - plane layout and the boresight and roll angles , hence if the offset in the roll angle has been accounted for , and the focal - plane layout is known , any remaining offset in the opening angles will be due to an offset in the boresight angle .",
    "once the values of the reference phase , roll angle and the point source positions have been evaluated , as above , the positions of the point sources may be used to evaluate the value of the ordinate for each detection , where the ordinate is angular separation , in the cross - scan direction , between the point source and the path of los of the detector .",
    "the detections corresponding to the @xmath49 transit of the focal plane , in the cross - scan direction , of the @xmath24 point source are accumulated for each of the detectors .",
    "it is then possible to find the value of the ordinates which correspond to the peak of the transits , in the cross - scan direction , for each detector in which the @xmath49 transit was observed .",
    "if there is no offset in the opening angle to the @xmath5 detector the value of the ordinate at the peak of the transit will be zero .",
    "hence the offsets in the opening angles may be determined , at the epoch of each transit , by the analysis of the cross - scan transits of the point sources .",
    "the offsets in the opening angle to the detectors for each transit of the focal plane may then be used to find the offset in the boresight angle at the epoch of the transit , @xmath50 . as with the reference phase and roll angle parameters ,",
    "this offset may be expressed as a constant offset and a linear drift in time : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the epoch of the @xmath49 transit . by assessing the value of @xmath53 at every available epoch , epochs at which the focal plane transited a sufficiently bright point source , the time variation of the boresight angle",
    "may be investigated , and hence the systematic offset , @xmath54 , and linear drift , @xmath55 , may be evaluated .",
    "the evaluation of the reference phase , roll angle and point source positions is an iterative process , with offsets found from their inital values used in the further refinement of these parameters until convergence is reached .",
    "the offsets in the boresight angle should only need to be evaluated once , as the point source positions may be found independently of any offset in the boresight angle , as discussed above in section   [ methods_refphase ] .",
    "in practice , however , any significant offsets in the geometric - calibration parameters will affect which detections are classed as belonging to a single point source .",
    "it is therefore necessary to iterate over all the parameters , and reassign the detections as improvements in the values of the geometric - calibration parameters occur .",
    "in order to assess the performance of the methods developed here in the reconstruction of the geometric - calibration parameters , it is necessary to simulate a list of point source detections for the _ planck _ mission .",
    "this requires an input point source catalogue , together with a scanning strategy and information on the beams of the _ planck _ detectors . throughout this paper",
    "we have made the simplifying assumption of gaussian beams .",
    "while it is anticipated that this method will be applicable to any scanning strategy in which the circles corresponding to a single spin axis position may be binned together as a ring , only two potential scanning strategies for _ planck _ were investigated here , a sinusoidal and a precessional scanning strategy . where the sinusoidal scanning strategy may be described by : @xmath56 and the precessional scanning strategy by : @xmath57 where @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the position of the sun at the time the first ring",

    "the values of these parameters used here are @xmath61=2.5 , @xmath65=2 , @xmath66 , and @xmath64=10@xmath67 .",
    "this value of @xmath61 , given a repointing once per hour , keeps the spin axis directed away from the sun .",
    "the approximate numbers of point sources visible with _ planck _ may be predicted by using the iras point source catalogue ( psc , @xcite ) .",
    "this is a catalogue of some 250,000 well - confirmed point sources , providing positions , flux densities at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 , uncertainties and various cautionary flags which are given for each source .",
    "the selection of objects from this catalogue and the extrapolation of their fluxes to planck frequencies , is discussed in @xcite .",
    "also included in the input catalogue is the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe , wmap , point source catalogue , @xcite .",
    "this consists of 208 extragalactic sources as seen in the wmap maps , at _",
    "lfi frequencies .",
    "these sources may be extrapolated to _ planck _",
    "hfi frequencies using the spectral indices provided in the wmap catalogue .",
    "the input point source catalogue constructed this way contains 5796 extragalactic point sources and 2286 galactic sources .",
    "table  [ inputcat30_table ] shows the number of galactic and extragalactic sources detectable above a signal - to - noise ratio of 30 in the rings , for each of the _ planck _ frequencies , under the assumption of the goal noise levels , shown in table  [ noiselevel_table ] .",

    "the methods presented here show that recovering the geometric - calibration parameters as part of the initial stages of the construction of the final source catalogue , successfully extracts any offsets in the values of these parameters , using only the detections due to extragalactic point sources . the accuracy",
    "to which the geometric - calibration parameters may be attained far exceeds the pointing accuracy requirements as discussed in section  [ acc_reqments ] , so much so that it has proved possible to recover the geometric - calibration parameters under the non - ideal conditions of the loss of a frequency channel , and double the goal noise levels . the accuracies to which the geometric - calibration parameters may be recovered , are such that the errors in the pointing reconstruction due to errors in the geometric - calibration parameters are of the same level as the errors in the pointing reconstruction due to the uncertainties in the mean spin axis position recovered by the star tracker which are expected to be of the order of 1 - 2 .",
    "the achievable accuracies for the geometric - calibration parameters as found above did not include errors in the remaining geometric - calibration parameters found solely from the star tracker such as errors in the mean spin axis position or the velocity - phase relation .",
    "the expected level of these errors , however , has a negligible effect on the errors found above .",
    "the focal - plane layout , relative to the frp , was assumed to be fixed and known .",
    "if thermal variations produce offsets in the positions of the detectors relative to the frp , these will also need to be recovered using the science data .",
    "it is anticipated that the any positional offsets in the focal - plane layout will be recovered using the planetary transits of the focal plane .",
    "the methods presented here have assumed gaussian beams . in reality , however , the _ planck _ beams will not be gaussian .",
    "if the beams are not symmetric about the scan direction then the phase , corresponding to the peak amplitude of the transit , will depend on the ordinate of the point source .",
    "any dependence of the phase , of the transit , on the ordinate of the point source must be included in the analysis , and may lead to increases in the errors of the phases for the detections .",
    "we have however demonstrated that doubling the error in the phase of each transit has the effect of roughly doubling the error in the pointing reconstruction due to the geometric calibrations parameters , and these resultant errors still easily meet the required pointing accuracy .",
    "there is therefore plenty of scope for increased uncertainties in the positions of the transits .    due to the number of available bright point sources , the time resolution of the recovery of the geometric - calibration parameters is poor and any fast evolution in a parameter will not be recoverable from the science data . of concern is whether an unsolved variation in a parameter could bias the recovery of the parameter through an uneven distribution of detections . to investigate this possibility ,",
    "the effect of an unsolved drift in the parameters was investigated .",
    "an unrecovered drift was found not to affect the recovered value of the systematic offset until the pointing requirements are exceeded by the unrecovered drift itself .",
    "it is therefore likely that any unsolved for variations will not affect the recovery of the systematic offsets and drifts while they are small enough not to be a problem in and of themselves .",
