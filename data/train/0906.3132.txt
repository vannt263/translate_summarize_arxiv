    "a seminal paper by ando , li and mathias @xcite defined the mathematical problem by stating ten properties that a `` good '' matrix geometric mean should satisfy .",
    "however , these properties do not uniquely define a multivariate matrix geometric mean ; thus several different definitions appeared in literature .",
    "ando , li and mathias @xcite first proposed a mean whose definition for @xmath4 matrices is based on a limit process involving several geometric means of @xmath5 matrices .",
    "later bini , meini and poloni @xcite noted that the slow convergence speed of this method prevents its use in applications ; its main shortcoming is the fact that its complexity grows as @xmath6 with the number of involved matrices . in the same paper , they proposed a similar limit process with increased convergence speed , but still with complexity @xmath6 .",
    "plfia @xcite proposed a mean based on a similar process involving only means of @xmath7 matrices , and thus much simpler and cheaper to compute , but lacking property p3 ( permutation invariance ) from the alm list .",
    "lim @xcite proposed a family of matrix geometric means that are based on an iteration requiring at each step the computation of a mean of @xmath8 matrices .",
    "since the computational complexity for all known means greatly increases with @xmath4 , the resulting family is useful as an example but highly impractical for numerical computations .    at the same time ,",
    "moakher @xcite and bhatia and holbrook @xcite proposed a completely different definition , which we shall call the _ riemannian centroid _ of @xmath9 .",
    "the riemannian centroid @xmath10 is defined as the minimizer of a sum of squared distances , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the geodesic distance induced by a natural riemannian metric on the space of symmetric positive definite matrices .",
    "the same @xmath13 is the unique solution of the equation @xmath14 involving the matrix logarithm function . while most of the alm properties are easy to prove , it is still an open problem whether it satisfies p4 ( monotonicity ) .",
    "the computational experiments performed up to now gave no counterexamples , but the monotonicity of the riemannian centroid is still a conjecture @xcite , up to our knowledge .    moreover , while the other means had constructive definitions , it is not apparent how to compute the solution to either or .",
    "two methods have been proposed , one based on a fixed - point iteration @xcite and one on the newton methods for manifolds @xcite .",
    "although both seem to work well on `` tame '' examples , their computational results show a fast degradation of the convergence behavior as the number of matrices and their dimension increase .",
    "it is unclear whether on more complicated examples there is convergence in the first place ; unlike the other means , the convergence of these iteration processes has not been proved , as far as we know .    [ [ notations ] ] notations",

    "while the former iteration converges linearly , the latter converges cubically , and thus allows one to compute a matrix geometric mean with a lower number of iterations .",
    "in fact , if we call @xmath74 the average number of iterations that the process giving a mean of @xmath75 matrices takes to converge ( which may vary significantly depending on the starting matrices ) , the total computational cost of the alm and bmp means can be expressed as @xmath76 .",
    "the only difference between the two complexity bounds lies in the expected magnitude of the values @xmath74 .",
    "the presence of a factorial and of a linear number of factors @xmath74 is undesirable , since it means that the problem scales very badly with @xmath4 .",

    "we point out that the definition in the original paper @xcite is slightly different , as it considers several possible orderings of the input matrices , but the means defined there can be put in the form up to a permutation of the starting matrices @xmath63 .    as for the previous means",
    ", it can be proved that the iteration converges to a scalar @xmath4-tuple ; we call the common limit of all components @xmath82 .",
    "as we noted above , this function does not satisfy p3 ( permutation invariance ) , and thus it is not a geometric mean in the alm sense .    [",

    "the possibilities for defining new iterations following this pattern are endless .",
    "ando , li , mathias , and bini , meini , poloni chose to use in the first step composite functions using computationally expensive means of @xmath5 matrices ; this led to poor convergence results .",
    "plfia chose instead to use more economical means of two variables as starting points ; this led to better convergence ( no @xmath6 ) , but to a function which is not symmetric with respect to permutations of its entries ( p3 , permutation invariance ) .",
    "as we shall see in the following , the property p3 is crucial : all the other ones are easily proved for a mean defined as composition / limit of existing means .    a natural question to ask",
    "is whether we can build a matrix geometric mean of @xmath4 matrices as the composition of matrix means of less matrices , without the need of a limit process .",
    "two such unsuccessful attempts are reported in the paper by ando , li and mathias @xcite , as examples of the fact that it is not easy to define a matrix satisfying p1p10 .",

    "again , this function is not symmetric in its arguments , and thus fails to satisfy p3 .",
    "a second natural question is whether an iterative scheme such as the ones for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 can yield p3 without having a @xmath6 computational cost .",
    "for example , if we could build a scheme similar to the alm and bmp ones , but using only means of @xmath89 matrices in the recursion , then the @xmath6 growth would disappear .",
    "in this paper , we aim to analyze in more detail the process of `` assembling '' new matrix means from the existing ones , and show which new means can be found , and what can not be done because of group - theoretical obstructions related to the symmetry properties of the composed functions . by means of a group - theoretical analysis",
    ", we will show that for @xmath0 a new matrix mean exists which is simpler to compute than the existing ones ; numerical experiments show that the new definition leads to a significant computational advantage .",

    "then , @xmath305 is a quasi - mean with isotropy group containing @xmath112 .    from theorem [ t : composition ]",
    ", it follows that @xmath306 is a quasi - mean for each @xmath75 . since all the properties defining a quasi - mean pass to the limit",
    ", @xmath307 is a quasi - mean itself .",
    "let us take @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "it is easy to prove by induction on @xmath75 that @xmath310 .",
    "now , choose a matrix norm inducing the euclidean topology on @xmath15 ; let @xmath311 be fixed , and let us take @xmath312 such that for all @xmath313 and for all @xmath299 the following inequalities hold :    * @xmath314 , * @xmath315 .",
    "we know that @xmath316 , therefore @xmath317 since @xmath318 is arbitrary , the two limits must coincide .",
    "this holds for each @xmath308 , therefore @xmath319 .    the map @xmath49 defining @xmath278 is @xmath320 one can see that @xmath321 for each @xmath322 , and thus with the choice @xmath323 we get that @xmath49 preserves @xmath272",
    "thus , by theorem  [ th : iteration ] , @xmath324 is a geometric mean of four matrices .",
    "the same reasoning applies to @xmath87 .",
    "the map @xmath49 defining @xmath325 is @xmath326 @xmath49 preserves the dihedral group @xmath273",
    ". therefore , provided the iteration process converges to a scalar @xmath4-tuple , @xmath327 is a quasi - mean with isotropy group containing @xmath273 .    [ [ efficiency - of - the - limit - process ] ] efficiency of the limit process + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as in the previous section , we are interested in seeing whether this approach , which is the one that has been used to prove invariance properties of the known limit means @xcite , can yield better results for a different map @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath293 preserve a group @xmath112 .",
    "then , the invariance group of each of its components @xmath328 , @xmath329 , is a subgroup of @xmath112 of index at most @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath69 be fixed , and set @xmath330 .",
    "the sets @xmath331 are mutually disjoint and their union is @xmath112 , so the largest one has cardinality at least @xmath332 , let us call it @xmath333 .    from the hypothesis that @xmath49 preserves @xmath112 , we get @xmath334 for each @xmath27 and each @xmath335 .",
    "let @xmath336 be an element of @xmath331 ; then @xmath337 .",
    "thus the isotropy group of @xmath328 contains all the elements of the form @xmath338 , @xmath335 , and those are at least @xmath332 .",
    "the following result holds @xcite .    for @xmath1 ,",
    "the only subgroups of @xmath114 with index at most @xmath4 are :    * the alternating group @xmath124 , * the @xmath4 groups @xmath339 , @xmath340 , all of which are isomorphic to @xmath341 , * for @xmath342 only , another conjugacy class of @xmath343 subgroups of index @xmath343 isomorphic to @xmath344 .",

    "this shows that whenever we try to construct a geometric mean of @xmath4 matrices by taking a limit processes , such as in the ando  li ",
    "mathias approach , the isotropy groups of the starting means must contain @xmath346 . on the other hand , by theorem  [ t : isosharp ]",
    ", we can not generate means whose isotropy group contains @xmath346 by composition of simpler means ; therefore , there is no simpler approach than that of building a mean of @xmath4 matrices as a limit process of means of @xmath5 matrices ( or at least quasi - means with @xmath348 , which makes little difference ) .",
    "this shows that the recursive approach of @xmath86 and @xmath87 can not be simplified while still maintaining p3 ( permutation invariance ) .",

    "on the other hand , it turns out that for @xmath0 , since @xmath124 is not a simple group , there is the possibility of obtaining a mean that is computationally simpler than the ones in use .",
    "such a mean is the one we described in example  [ tournamentmean ] .",
    "let us take any mean of three elements ( we shall use @xmath349 here since it is the one with the best computational results ) ; the new mean is therefore defined as @xmath350 notice that only one limit process is needed to compute the mean ; conversely , when computing @xmath351 or @xmath352 we are performing an iteration whose elements are computed by doing four additional limit processes ; thus we may expect a large saving in the overall computational cost .",
    "we may extend the definition recursively to @xmath1 elements using the construction described in , but with @xmath353 instead of @xmath87 . the total computational cost , computed in the same fashion as for the alm and bmp means , is @xmath354 .",
    "thus the undesirable dependence from @xmath355 does not disappear ; the new mean should only yield a saving measured by a multiplicative constant in the complexity bound .",

    "it consists of five sets of matrices to average , with @xmath4 varying from 4 to 6 , and @xmath356 matrices split into smaller diagonal blocks .    for each of the five data sets ,",
    "we have computed both the bmp and the new matrix mean .",
    "the cpu times are reported in table  [ t : times ] . as a stopping criterion for the iterations",
    ", we used @xmath357    .cpu times for the elasticity data sets [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results are well within the errors permitted by the stopping criterion , and show that both algorithms can reach a satisfying precision .",

    "moreover , we show that using only function compositions and limit processes with the existing proof strategies , it is not possible to achieve any further significant improvement with respect to the existing algorithms .",
    "in particular , the dependency from @xmath355 can not be removed .",
    "new attempts should focus on other aspects , such as :    * proving new `` unexpected '' algebraic relations involving the existing matrix means , which would allow to break out of the framework of theorem  [ t : isosharp]theorem  [ th : iteration ] . * introducing new kinds of matrix geometric means or quasi - means , different from the ones built using function composition and limits . *",
