    "quantum state transfer between two distant parties is an important and a rewarding task in quantum information processing and quantum communications .",
    "several proposals have been put forward employing schemes based on cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "more recently quantum state transfer in quantum optomechanics , where mechanical modes are coupled to the optical modes via radiation pressure , has become a subject of interest @xcite . in particular , entanglement transfer between two spatially separated cavities is appealing in quantum information . entangling two movable mirrors of an optical ring cavity @xcite , two mirrors of two different cavities illuminated by",
    "entangled light beams @xcite , and two mirrors of a double - cavity set up coupled to two independent squeezed vacua @xcite have been considered .",
    "recently , entangling two mirrors of a ring cavity fed by two independent squeezed vacua has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this , however , can not be used to implement long distance entanglement transfer because the two movable mirrors belong to the same cavity .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a simple model to entangle the states of two movable mirrors of spatially separated nanoresonators coupled to a common two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "the two - mode squeezed light , which can be generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion , is injected into the nanoresonators as biased noise fluctuations with nonclassical correlations .",
    "the nanoresonators are also driven by two independent coherent lasers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the modes of the movable mirrors are coupled to their respective optical modes and to their local environments .",
    "our analysis goes beyond the adiabatic regime @xcite by considering the more general case of nonadiabatic regime and asymmetries between the laser drives as well as mechanical frequencies of the movable mirrors . using parameters from a recent optomechanics experiment @xcite",
    ", we show that the states of the two initially independent movable mirrors can be entangled in the steady state as a result of entanglement transfer from the two - mode squeezed light .",
    "more interestingly , the entanglement in the two - mode light can be totally transferred to the relative position and the total momentum of the two movable mirrors when the following conditions are met : 1 ) the nanoresonators are resonant with the mechanical modes , 2 ) the resonator field adiabatically follows the motion of the mirrors , and 3 ) the optomechanical coupling is sufficiently strong .",
    "we also show that the entanglement transfer is possible in the nonadiabatic regime ( low mechanical quality factor ) , which is more closer to experimental reality . unlike previous schemes @xcite , where double - or ring cavity is considered , our scheme can be used , in principle , for practical test of entanglement between two distant movable mirrors , for example , by connecting the squeezed source to the nanoresonators by an optical fiber cable .",
    "given the recent successful experimental realization of strong optomechanical coupling @xcite and availability of strong squeezing up to 10 db @xcite , our proposal of efficient light - to - matter entanglement transfer may be realized experimentally .",
    "we consider two nanoresonators each having a movable mirror and coupled to a common two - mode squeezed vacuum reservoir , for example , from the output of the parametric down converter .",
    "one mode of the output of the squeezed vacuum is sent to the first nanoresonator and the other mode to the second nanoresonator .",

    "the coupled nonlinear quantum langevin equations [ eqs . and ] are in general not solvable analytically . to obtain analytical solution to these equations , we adopt the following linearization scheme @xcite .",
    "we decompose the mode operators as a sum of the steady state average and a fluctuation quantum operator as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are operators .",

    "and in the steady state @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the effective detuning , which include the displacement of the mirrors due to the radiation pressure force .",
    "the contribution from the displacement of the movable mirrors is proportional to the intensity of the nanoresonator field , @xmath39 . in principle",

    "using @xmath41 and @xmath31 , eqs . and",
    "can be written as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the many - photon optomechanical coupling .",
    "since the phase of the coherent drives can be arbitrary , for convenience we have chosen the phase of the input field to be @xmath44 so that @xmath45 . notice that the linearized equations and can be described by an effective hamiltonian ( @xmath7 ) @xmath46\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a new effective many - photon optomechanical coupling @xmath47 , which is stronger than the single photon coupling @xmath48 by a factor of @xmath49 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describes two different processes depending on the choice of the laser detuning @xmath40 @xcite .",

    "the latter condition is the case when the resonators are strongly off - resonant with the laser fields .",
    "when @xmath52 , within the rotating wave approximation , the interaction hamiltonian reduces to @xmath53 , which is relevant for quantum state transfer @xcite and cooling ( transferring of all thermal phonons into cold photon mode ) @xcite . in quantum optics , it is referred to as a beam - splitter interaction .",
    "whereas , when @xmath54 ( in rotating wave approximation ) , the interaction hamiltonian takes a simple form @xmath55 , which describes parametric amplification interaction and can be used for efficient generation of optomechanical squeezing and entanglement . in this work , we are interested in quantum state transfer and hence choose @xmath52 .",
    "thus , for @xmath52 and in a frame rotating with frequency @xmath1 ( neglecting the fast oscillating terms ) , one gets @xmath56 where we have introduced a notation for operators : @xmath57 .    in the following section we use these equations to analyze the entanglement of the states of the movable mirrors via entanglement transfer",
    "in order to investigate the entanglement between the states of the movable mirrors of the two spatially separated nanoresonators , we introduce two epr - type quadrature operators for the mirrors , namely their relative position @xmath58 and the total momentum @xmath59 : @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we apply entanglement criterion @xcite for continuous variables which is sufficient for nongaussian states , and sufficient and necessary for gaussian states . according to this criterion ,",
    "the states of the movable mirrors are entangled if @xmath64 thus for maximally entangled states ( epr or bell states ) the total variance becomes 0 , while for separable states the sum of the variances will be equal or greater than 2 .",
    "an optimal quantum state transfer ( in this case from the two - mode squeezed vacuum to the mechanical motion of the mirrors ) is achieved when the nanoresonator fields adiabatically follow the mirrors , @xmath65 @xcite , which is the case for mirrors with high - q mechanical factor and weak effective optomechanical coupling .",
    "( in fact the condition @xmath66 can also be expressed as @xmath67 . ) inserting the steady state solution of into , we obtain equations describing the dynamics of the movable mirrors @xmath68 where @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the effective damping rate induced by the radiation pressure @xcite .    first , let us consider the variance of the relative position of the two mirrors @xmath71 , which can be expressed as @xmath72 . since the noise operators corresponding to the two - mode squeezed vacuum @xmath22 as well as the movable mirrors baths @xmath21 have zero mean values , it is easy to show that @xmath73 . therefore , @xmath74 . to evaluate these correlations ,",
    "it is more convenient to work in frequency domain . to this end ,",
    "the fourier transform of eqs .",
    "yields @xmath75 the expectation value of the position @xmath76 of the first movable mirror can be expressed as @xmath77 using the correlation properties of the noise operators [ eqs . - ] , we obtain @xmath78 similarly , it is easy to show that @xmath79 therefore , using eqs .",
    "- , the variance of the relative position of the movable mirrors becomes @xmath80 it is easy to show that the variance of the total momentum of the movable mirrors is the same as that of @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the sum of the variances of the relative position and total momentum of the movable mirrors is given by     vs bath temperature @xmath82 of the movable mirrors for drive laser power @xmath83 and frequency @xmath84 , mass of the movable mirrors @xmath85 , frequency of the nanoresonator @xmath86 , length of the cavity @xmath87 , the mechanical motion damping rate @xmath88 , @xmath89 , nanoresonator damping rate @xmath90 , and for different values of the squeezing parameter @xmath29 : 0.5 ( blue solid curve ) , 1.0 ( red dashed curve ) , and 2.0 ( green dotted curve ) .",
    "the blue dashed line represents @xmath91.,width=226 ]    @xmath92      to elucidate the physics of light - to - matter entanglement transfer , we first consider a simplified case of identical nanoresonators coupled to two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "we also assume the external laser drives to have the same strength and the thermal baths of the two movable mirrors to be at the same temperature ( @xmath93 ) . to this end",
    ", setting @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , and using the relation @xmath101 , the variance of the relative position takes a simple form @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the optomechanical cooperativity @xcite . in the absence of the two - mode squeezed vacuum reservoir @xmath104 , eq .",
    "reduces to @xmath105 , which is always greater than 2 , indicating the mechanical motion of the two mirrors can not be entangled without the squeezed vacuum .",
    "this is because the motion of the mirrors are initially uncorrelated and their interaction via vacuum does not create correlations . in the limit @xmath106 ( a weaker condition @xcite for strong coupling regime ) , the sum of the variances can be approximated by @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath108 , which can be achieved for sufficiently large number of photons in the nanoresonator , the sum of the variances can be less than 2 when @xmath109,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] indicating transfer of the quantum fluctuations of the input fields to the motion of the movable mirrors .",
    "this can be interpreted as entanglement transfer from light to mechanical motion .",
    "the interesting aspect is that this quantum state transfer scheme can , in principle , be extended to long distance state transfer if the two nanoresonators are kept far apart but connected by , for example , an optical fiber cable to the output of the two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "obviously , the entanglement between the mirrors would degrade when the distance between the resonators is increased owing to the decrease in degree of squeezing as a result of environmental couplings .",
    "recently , similar transfer scheme from light to matter has been proposed @xcite .    for realistic estimation of the entanglement between the movable mirrors , we use parameters from recent experiment @xcite : laser frequency @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath88 , @xmath115 .",

    "this figure shows that the movable mirrors are entangled when the nanoresonators are fed with squeezed light .",
    "notice that based on the definition of the quadrature operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 , an optomechanical quadrature squeezing @xcite is achieved when @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "this implies that whenever there is optomechanical squeezing , the two movable mirrors are always entangled .",
    "this shows a direct relationship between optomechanical squeezing and entanglement of the mechanical modes of the movable mirrors .",

    "<S> we analyze a scheme to entangle the movable mirrors of two spatially separated nanoresonators via a broadband squeezed light . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to transfer the epr - type continuous - variable entanglement from the squeezed light to the mechanical motion of the movable mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> an optimal entanglement transfer is achieved when the nanoresonators are tuned at resonance with the vibrational frequencies of the movable mirrors and when strong optomechanical coupling is attained . </S>",
    "<S> stationary entanglement of the states of the movable mirrors as strong as that of the input squeezed light can be obtained for sufficiently large optomechanical cooperativity , achievable in currently available optomechanical systems . the scheme can be used to implement long distance quantum state transfer provided that the squeezed light interacts with the nanoresonators . </S>"
