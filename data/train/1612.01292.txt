    "quantum field theory provides a rich source of mathematical thoughts . one important feature of quantum field theory that lies secretly behind many of its surprising mathematical predictions is about its nature of infinite dimensionality .",
    "a famous example is the mysterious mirror symmetry conjecture between symplectic and complex geometries , which can be viewed as a version of infinite dimensional fourier transform .",
    "typically , many quantum problems are formulated in terms of  path integrals \" , which require measures that are mostly not yet known to mathematicians .",
    "nevertheless , asymptotic analysis can always be performed with the help of the celebrated idea of renormalization .    despite the great success of renormalization theory in physics applications ,",
    "its use in mathematics is relatively limited but extremely powerful when it does apply .",
    "one such example is kontsevich s solution @xcite to the deformation quantization problem on arbitrary poisson manifolds .",
    "kontsevich s explicit formula of star product is obtained via graph integrals on a compactification of configuration space on the disk , which can be viewed as a geometric renormalization of the perturbative expansion of poisson sigma model ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another recent example is costello s homotopic theory @xcite of effective renormalizations in the batalin - vilkovisky formalism .",
    "this leads to a systematic construction of factorization algebras via quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "for example , a natural geometric interpretation of the witten genus is obtained in such a way @xcite .    to facilitate geometric applications of effective renormalization methods , it would be key to connect renormalized quantities to geometric objects",
    ". we will be mainly interested in quantum field theory with gauge symmetries .",
    "the most general framework of quantizing gauge theories is the batalin - vilkovisky formalism @xcite , where the quantum consistency of gauge transformations is described by the so - called _ quantum master equation_. there have developed several mathematical approaches to incorporate batalin - vilkovisky formalism with renormalizations since their birth .",
    "the central quantity of all approaches lies in the renormalized quantum master equation . in this paper",
    ", we will mainly discuss the formalism in @xcite , which has developed a convenient framework that is also rooted in the homotopic culture of derived algebraic geometry . a brief introduction to the philosophy of this approach",
    "is discussed in section [ section - bv ] .",
    "the simplest nontrivial example is given by quantum mechanical models , which can be viewed as quantum field theories in one dimension .",
    "the renormalized batalin - vilkovisky quantization in the above fashion is analyzed in @xcite for topological quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , it is shown in @xcite that the renormalized quantum master equation can be identified with the geometric equation of fedosov s abelian connection @xcite on weyl bundles over symplectic manifolds .",
    "the algebraic nature of this correspondence is reviewed in section [ section - example ] .",
    "such a correspondence leads to a simple geometric approach to algebraic index theorem @xcite , where the index formula follows from the homotopic renormalization group flow together with an equivariant localization of bv integration @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study systematically the renormalized quantum master equation in two dimensions .",
    "we will focus on quantum theories obtained by chiral deformations of free cft s ( see section [ section-2d ] for our precise set - up ) .",
    "one important feature of such two dimensional chiral theories is that they are free of ultra - violet divergence ( see theorem [ thm - defn ] ) .",
    "this greatly simplifies the analysis of quantization since singular counter - terms are not required .",
    "however , the renormalized quantum master equation requires quantum corrections by chiral local functionals .",
    "such quantum corrections could in principle be very complicated .",
    "one of our main results in this paper ( theorem [ main - thm ] ) is an exact description of the quantum corrections in terms of vertex algebras .",
    "briefly speaking , theorem [ main - thm ] states that the renormalized quantum master equations ( qme ) is equivalent to quantum corrected chiral vertex operators that satisfies maurer - cartan ( mc ) equations .",
    "in other words , we have an exact description of the quantization of chiral deformation of two dimensional conformal field theories @xmath0 the maurer - cartan equation serves as an integrability condition for chiral vertex operators , which is often related to integrable hierarchies in concrete cases .",
    "we discuss such an example in section [ section - b ] .",
    "furthermore , we prove a general result on the modularity property of the generating functions and their holomorphic anomaly ( theorem [ thm - modularity ] ) . this work is also motivated from understanding dijkgraaf s description @xcite of chiral deformation of conformal field theories .",
    "the above correspondence can be viewed as the two dimensional vertex algebra analogue of the one dimensional result in @xcite .",
    "in fact , one main motivation of the current work is to explore the analogue of index theorem for chiral vertex operators in terms of the method of equivariant localization in bv integration as proceeded in @xcite .",
    "it allows us to solve many quantization problems in terms of powerful techniques in vertex algebras .    as an application in section [ section - b ] ,",
    "we construct an exact solution of quantum b - model on elliptic curves , which leads to the solution of the corresponding higher genus mirror symmetry conjecture .",
    "mirror symmetry is a famous duality between symplectic ( a - model ) and complex ( b - model ) geometries that arises from superconformal field theories .",
    "it has been a long - standing challenge for mathematicians to construct quantum b - model on compact calabi - yau manifolds . in @xcite",
    ", we construct a gauge theory of polyvector fields on calabi - yau manifolds ( called bcov theory ) as a generalization of the kodaira - spencer gauge theory @xcite .",
    "it is proposed in @xcite ( as a generalization of @xcite ) that the batalin - vilkovisky quantization of bcov theory leads to quantum b - model that is mirror to the a - model gromov - witten theory of counting higher genus curves .",
    "our construction in section [ section - b ] gives a concrete realization of this program .",
    "this leads to the first mathematically fully established example of quantum b - model on compact calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "our result in section [ section - b ] also leads to an interesting result in physics .",
    "quantum bcov theory can be viewed as a complete description of topological b - twisted closed string field theory in the sense of zwiebach @xcite .",
    "zwiebach s closed string field theory describes the dynamics of closed strings in term of the so - called string vertices . despite the beauty of this construction , string vertices are very difficult to compute and few concrete examples are known .",
    "our exact solution in section [ section - b ] can be viewed as giving an explicit realization of zwiebach s string vertices for b - twisted topological string on elliptic curves",
