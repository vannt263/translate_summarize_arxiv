    "the x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) can exhibit such significant differences from one epoch to the next that it can become very difficult to extract meaningful constraints from single - epoch spectra .",
    "multi - epoch data are particularly useful to constrain model components that fluctuate on vastly different time scales , thereby removing excessive freedom in some fit parameters ( e.g. gallo 2010 , 2007a , b ; grupe 2008 ; zoghbi 2008 ) and allowing for more insightful discussion .",
    "one attractive proposition is to catch agn in a particularly low x - ray flux state ( gallo 2006 ) . in principle",
    ", the low - flux state can provide the best perspective of the agn environment , for example the nature of the accretion disc and associated relativistic features ( e.g. miller 2007 ) and/or the surrounding ionised plasmas ( e.g. longinotti 2008 ) since the direct continuum ( i.e. the power law component ) is substantially suppressed ( e.g. schartel 2010 , ballo 2008 , grupe 2008 ; vignali 2008 ; miniutti 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , examining the spectral changes from high- to low - flux states can potentially reveal the origin of the variability , whether it be : light - bending ( e.g. miniutti & fabian 2004 ) , absorption ( e.g. turner & miller 2009 ) , or beaming ( e.g. gallo 2010 , 2007b ) .",
    "efforts to identify objects in the low x - ray flux state by monitoring agns with  and triggering a pointed  observation when an object is discovered to be in a low - state are proving advantageous ( e.g. grupe 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "we have recently applied this strategy to catch the type - i quasar , 08  ( @xmath1 ) in an x - ray weak state . as we describe in sect .",
    "3.1 . in 2009 , 08  was in a x - ray weak and low - flux state . ]",
    "08  is a particularly interesting radio - quiet agn . sufficiently bright in the optical to be termed a quasar , it possesses strong  emission and weak  like a narrow - line seyfert  1 ( nls1 ) , though its fwhm(h@xmath2 ) ( @xmath3 , boroson & green 1992 ) is slightly above the oft - quoted upper limit for a nls1 of @xmath4 ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",

    "pounds ( 2003 ) reported absorption features in this same data set that they interpreted as high - mass , relativistic outflows .",
    "a subsequent reanalysis of the data along with a deeper observation by brinkmann ( 2006 ) could not confirm the absorption features reported by pounds and attributed them to calibration uncertainties ( see also vaughan & uttley 2008 ) .    in march 2009 , 08",

    "the variable component can not be fit by a single power law across the entire band , thus indicating there is at least another component contributing to the long - term variability .    in combination with the  analysis by wang ( 2000 )",
    ", the low - energy flux variations may be generally more significant in 08  than at high energies .",
    "the combined epic light curve from each  observations is shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "flux variations on rapid time scales ( e.g. @xmath31 ) are present in the longer and higher signal - to - noise light curves composing the two high state observations . during the low - flux state",
    "the agn is constant on the @xmath32  per cent level .",
    "spectral variability is examined for in the longest observation ( 2001 ) and in the low - flux state ( 2009 ) by calculating the fractional variability ( @xmath33 ) at various energies ( e.g. ponti 2004 ) . in 2001",
    "08  was in a high - flux state corresponding to the brightest smooth spectrum ( green data ) in figure  [ fig : comp ] .",
    "the spectral variability is modest , but there is a trend of increasing amplitude with energy .",
    "the 2009 data are of lower quality as the variability is small and the observation is short .",
    "there is no detectable spectral variability within about @xmath34  per cent .",
    "the @xmath33 spectra are presented and discussed further in section  [ sect : dis ] and figure  [ fig : fvar ] .    hardness ratio variability curves in various energy bands during the 2001 epoch show modest to low fluctuations with time .",
    "there also appears to be no significant correlation between hardness ratio fluctuations and count rate .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by brinkmann ( 2006 ) .      in this section",
    "we attempt to fit the spectra of 08  with phenomological agn models . fitting a power law modified by galactic absorption to the @xmath35 and @xmath36 band , and",
    "then extrapolating over the @xmath37 band generates the residuals seen in figure  [ fig : pofit ] . in the high - flux states the power law describes the data well above @xmath38 and positive residuals are seen above the power law below @xmath38 ( i.e. the soft excess ) .    in 2009",
    "the photon index of the power law fit is much flatter then in the high - flux state and the soft excess appears much stronger .",
    "there are also significant excess residuals between @xmath39 owing to the prominent spectral curvature in the low - flux state .",
    "the soft excess is well fitted with a black body in addition to the underlying power law .",
    "the best - fit temperature is comparable in the high - flux states : @xmath40 in 2000 and @xmath41 in 2001 ; but significantly higher in 2009 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "all the temperatures fall in the typical range exhibited by unabsorbed agn ( e.g. gierliski & done 2004 ; crummy 2006 ) .",
    "the measured temperature is not correlated in an obvious manner with the black body luminosity ( e.g. the highest temperature corresponds to the intermediate luminosity ) and a standard thermal accretion disc origin for the soft excess is unlikely .",
    "a narrow ( @xmath43 ) gaussian profile is added to the fit to search for  emission at @xmath44 arising from distant material ( e.g. the torus ) .",
    "a marginal improvement over the power law model is seen at each epoch including such a feature , and the measured energies and fluxes are consistent at all epochs . fitting a common feature",
    "at all epochs provides the most significant detection ( table  [ tab : gauss ] ) .",
    "when permitting the width of the line to vary , the fit prefers a broad feature likely compensating for spectral curvature and/or emission due to he- and h - like iron . while these high - ionisation lines may very well be present",
    ", they would not account for the excess flux at @xmath45 .",
    "our measurements of energy and flux are consistent with the recent analysis of shu ( 2010 ) who detected a significant @xmath46 emission line in one - third of a  hetg observation of 08 .",
    "the spectral changes from high- to low - flux state in 08  are significant ( e.g. figure  [ fig : comp ] ) . in this section",
    "we will attempt to model the entire data set with more physical models and in a self consistent manner . in shape ,",
    "the low - flux spectrum of 08  is reminiscent of other agns caught in a low - flux state ( e.g. 1h  0707495 and mrk  335 ) . the spectrum of such objects being modelled by blurred reflection or some form of partial covering .",
    "all models include two narrow gaussian profiles with fixed energies and widths ( @xmath43 ) that account for distant  ( @xmath47 ) detected here and with  ( shu 2010 ) , and the undetected but expected  ( @xmath48 ) emission line .",
    "the normalisation of the  feature is fixed to 0.17 that of the .",
    "all models and parameters are shown in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "based on the statistically best - fit model ( i.e. the ionised disc reflection ) the @xmath28 luminosities of 08(corrected for galactic column density ) are @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the low- and high - flux state , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath25 luminosities in the low and high state are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "reflection from an ionised disc blurred for relativistic effects close to the black hole is often adopted to describe the origin of the soft excess ( ross & fabian 2005 ; ballantyne 2001 ) , and has been successfully fitted to the spectra of unabsorbed agn ( e.g. fabian 2004 ; crummy 2006 ) .",
    "in particular , the spectral complexity seen in the x - ray weak state can be attributed to a reflection dominated spectrum .",
    "that is when the direct power law component seen by the observer is significantly diminished due to obscuration ( e.g. fabian 2002 ) or light bending ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "an intrinsic power law continuum plus blurred ( kdblur ) reflection model is fit to the data of 08 .",
    "the use of multi - epoch data permits linking of parameters that are not expected to vary over observable periods , for example : disc inclination ( @xmath53 ) , iron abundance ( @xmath54 ) , outer disc radius ( @xmath55 ) . to further simplify the fitting process the inner ( @xmath56 ) and outer disc radius are fixed at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively ( @xmath59 ) . allowing these parameters",
    "to vary reproduced similar values , but did not significantly improve the fit quality .",
    "the only blurring parameter allowed to vary at each epoch is the emissivity profile of the disc , which is a power law in radius ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the ionisation parameter of the disc ( @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the hydrogen number density and @xmath63 is the distance between the ionising source and the material ) , power law continuum ( @xmath64 and normalisation ) and normalisation of the reflector are permitted to vary at each epoch .",
    "the model provides a good fit to the spectra at all three epochs ( @xmath65 ; figure  [ fig : reffit ] ) , and can be considered self - consistent . while there are several parameters that fluctuate from epoch - to - epoch the primary driver is the diminishing of the power law normalisation from high- to low - flux .",
    "indeed , during the x - ray weak state the x - ray spectrum of 08  is dominated by the reflection component ( figure  [ fig : reffit ] , upper panel ) .",
    "we estimate the reflection fraction ( @xmath66 ) at each epoch by comparing the expected model above @xmath67 ( where ionisation and absorption effects are minimum ) with the pexrav model in xspec ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) . during the high - flux state @xmath68 ,",
    "commensurate with an isotropic emitter . in the x - ray weak state ,",
    "@xmath69 indicating that extreme effects , such as light bending , may be at play .",
    "the models also show a flattening of the power law slope from high- to low - state . while some variability is expected in the shape of the power law with time , the change measured here is rather significant and difficult to reconcile .",
    "similar behaviour was noted in another agn , mrk  79 ( gallo 2010 ) .",
    "we consider a scenario where the intrinsic power law continuum is partially obscured by a neutral absorber along the line - of - sight ( e.g. grupe 2004 , gallo 2004 ) . in this picture , the observed spectrum is the combination of direct emission from the power law emitter and a highly obscured component .",
    "since a significant amount of time passes between observations , we allow for both intrinsic continuum changes ( i.e. changes in the power law shape and luminosity ) and changes in the characteristics of the absorber [ i.e. column density ( @xmath70 ) and covering fraction ( @xmath71 ) ] . the simplest case of a single absorber results in a poor fit ( @xmath72 ) and",
    "supports the addition of a second partial covering absorber ( i.e. neutral double partial covering ) .",
    "the double partial covering model is akin to two distinct absorbing regions or a column density gradient along the line - of - sight ( e.g. tanaka 2004 ) .",
    "the fit is significantly improved ( @xmath73 ) with the addition of the second absorber .",
    "the model parameters and fit quality are shown in table  [ tab : fits ] and figure  [ fig : pcfit ] ( top panel ) , respectively .",
    "the two absorbers have similar characteristics during the high - state observations ( 2000 and 2001 ) and together obscure about @xmath74  per cent of the power law light .",
    "to account for the low - flux state the column density and covering fraction of both absorbers increase , and together diminish the source flux in the @xmath37 band by about @xmath75  per cent .",
    "we also note that the intrinsic power law flux dropped by about @xmath76  per cent in 2009 from its 2001 high .",
    "noteworthy is the particularly steep spectrum that is required for the continuum ( @xmath77 ) at each epoch .",
    "a statistically worse , but not unreasonable fit , can be obtain by maintaining the shape and luminosity of the primary power law constant at all three epochs ( @xmath78 ; figure  [ fig : pclum ] ) . in this case , variations in the nature ( covering fraction and column density ) of the absorber account for the long - term variations in the shape and flux of the spectrum .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of the power law in the @xmath37 band is @xmath79 .",
    "the power law photon index remains steep ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "a modification of the partial covering model discussed above is to consider an absorber that is ionised ( reeves 2008 ) rather than neutral .",
    "the ionised material will preferentially absorb intermediate energy x - rays giving rise to the different spectral slopes on either side of @xmath81 .",
    "a single ionised absorber partially covering the primary continuum is a considerably better fit than the single neutral absorber ( @xmath82 ) , but significantly worse than the neutral double partial covering and ionised reflection models .",
    "the addition of a second ionised absorber was attempted to improve the fit . in initial",
    "fits the ionisation parameter of the second absorber was comparable at all three epochs so it was linked in subsequent fits .",
    "the improvement over the single ionised absorber was substantial ( @xmath83 for 7 additional parameters ) .",
    "the fit residuals are displayed in figure  [ fig : pcfit ] .",
    "notably , the ionisation of the absorber does not follow the predicted flux of the continuum as would be expected if the power law is the sole source of ionisation for the absorber and if the absorber was of high density .",
    "the two absorbers collectively obscure about @xmath84  per cent of the power law continuum in the high - state and about @xmath85  per cent in the low - flux state .",
    "the moderately low ionisation parameters predicted with this model will produce a spectrum rich in absorption features that should be detectable in high - resolution spectra even in the high - state .",
    "an analysis of the 2000  data ( including the rgs ) by pounds ( 2003 ) resulted in claims of highly blue - shifted absorption lines due to a high - velocity outflow , but was later dismissed by brinkmann ( 2006 ) .",
    "similar to the neutral partial covering , the long - term variations could be modelled with a constant power law and varying absorption parameters .",
    "the fit is slightly worse than that presented above ( @xmath73 ) and the intrinsic power law is again steep ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "in the x - ray weak state 08  shows considerable spectral hardening and curvature compared to the relatively smooth spectrum during the bright state .",
    "blurred ionised reflection models fit the multi - epoch spectra very well in a self - consistent manner .",
    "partial covering models , with either neutral or ionised absorbers , also work reasonably well .",
    "the reflection and absorption models appear spectroscopically similar in the @xmath37 band , but each model appears different at higher energies and predict different temporal behaviour .    in the blurred reflection model the principle difference between the high- and low - state is the prominence of the direct power law continuum reaching the observer . there is more than a factor of @xmath87 difference in the @xmath37 power law flux between the high- and low - state .",
    "in fact , during the low - state the reflection component dominates the epic spectrum and the measured reflection fraction is @xmath69 .",
    "the attenuation of the direct power law flux could be attributed to obscuring of the component ( e.g. fabian 2002 ) or by light bending effects ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , the reflection models also indicate variations in the flux and ionisation of the reflection component .",
    "these changes are manifested in a model - independent way in the difference spectrum ( figure  [ fig : diffs ] ) . rather than being a simple power law ( characteristic of normalisation changes alone )",
    ", the difference spectrum has a soft excess .",
    "ionisations changes in the reflection component would modify the soft excess .",
    "the light bending scenario makes specific predictions about the rapid temporal behaviour of the power law and reflection components in various flux states that can in turn be tested . in examining the 2001 @xmath33 spectrum ( figure  [ fig : fvar ] left panel )",
    "we consider a situation where the power law component fluctuates in brightness and dominates the variability ( i.e. the reflection component varies very little in comparison ) .",
    "such conditions are expected from the light bending model when the agn is in the bright state ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "such a model agrees well with the data of 08  ( figure  [ fig : fvar ] left panel ) .",
    "likewise , the expected @xmath33 based on the partial covering models is also shown in figure  [ fig : fvar ] .",
    "the models are adequate given the signal - to - noise , but both models clearly miss the data in some energy bins .",
    "the absorption models likely require variability of an additional parameter to reconcile the @xmath33 .",
    "gierliski & done ( 2006 ) consider changes in the ionisation parameter of the absorber ( in addition to power law flux ) to reconstruct the @xmath33 of some sources that show the recognised peak at intermediate energies .    in a similar fashion",
    "we conducted the same exercise for 08  in the low - flux state ( right panel figure  [ fig : fvar ] ) .",
    "the spectrum is of lower quality than the 2001 observation as the amplitude of the variations is low and the observation is short , and consequently no model can be ruled out with statistical certainty .",
    "however , we note that the models predict significantly different behaviour and with a longer low - flux observation ( and higher signal - to - noise ) the models could potentially be distinguished .",
    "if due to partial covering , the simultaneous uv / x - ray data could potentially place some restrictions on the geometry of the system depending on the nature of the absorber .",
    "the uv observations ( all longward of the lyman limit ) do not appear to exhibit diminishing flux as the x - rays do .",
    "the fact that we do not see uv variability simultaneous with the x - rays implies that any partial covering absorber , if present , has to be dust - free and confined to the x - ray emitting region .",
    "this requires the existence of very dense , cold blobs that are a substantial fraction of the source size , occupying a small region close to the source .",
    "ostensibly this would imply the presence of a strong iron fluorescence line that is not observed in the data . such a strong feature would be detectable unless the covering fraction was small or in a rather contrived geometry ( see reynolds 2009 and miller 2010 for opposing opinions ) .",
    "the uv spectrum of 08  also displays relatively weak civ absorption ( brandt 2000 ) .",
    "the feature is expected to be much stronger if the x - ray weak state of 08  were due to absorption from a bal - related phenomenon ( brandt 2000 ) .",
    "uv spectroscopy of 08  when it is in a x - ray weak state would confirm the absence of a bal absorber .",
    "the inferred intrinsic photon index measured in 08  is steeper than the canonical value of @xmath88 that is normally adopted ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "this seems to be independent of the model used and the flux - state of the agn ( except for the 2009 blurred reflection interpretation , see sect .",
    "[ sect : refl ] ) .",
    "there are potential explanations for this , for example if due to comptonisation 08  could have a cooler corona than the average agn leading to a steeper spectrum .",
    "it is difficult to put this in to context of the nls1/bls1 nature of 08 .",
    "nls1s are known to exhibit steeper spectra than bls1 ( e.g. boller 1996 ; brandt 1997 ) , but this is only based on the observed spectrum that is modified by reflection and warm absorption .",
    "a true comparison of the intrinsic nls1 and bls1 photon index to examine for physical difference between the two classes is still lacking .",
    "however , in the near future , as bat detections become more significant and hard x - ray imaging becomes possible , we will be in position to answer this question .",
    "each model has unique spectral signatures that could be discerned with higher spectral resolution or broader energy bandpass .",
    "the ionised absorber predicts absorption features in the spectra at @xmath89 due to various transitions in iron .",
    "such features may be lost in the epic data due to the moderate spectral resolution .",
    "however , shu ( 2010 ) present the  hetg spectrum of 08when it was in a comparable flux state as the 2000 and 2001  observations .",
    "the hetg spectrum is of modest quality , but shows no indication of absorption features in the iron region ( see figure 1 of shu ) .",
    "a higher signal - to - noise hetg spectrum could potential constrain such features .",
    "finally , all three models make vastly different predictions of the spectral shape and flux above @xmath67 .",
    "the absorption models have steeper intrinsic spectra ( @xmath90 ) and a weaker reflection component , whereas the blurred reflection model predicts a much flatter spectrum .",
    "the reflection model also predicts a @xmath91 flux that is twice as large in the high - state and @xmath92 greater in the low - state than the absorption models . based on our models ,",
    "the brightest flux reached by 08  in the @xmath93 band is @xmath94 and fluctuates to lower fluxes .",
    "this peak value is still a factor of 2 lower than the current detection limit of the  bat survey ( tueller 2010 ) .    through multi - epoch x - ray observations the reflection - dominated low - state spectrum of 08   appears more clearly .",
    "similar observations of several other agn also support the notion that the agn x - ray low - flux state may be due to a diminished power law that in turn reveals the underlying reflection spectrum .",
    "multi - epoch observations are necessary to distinguish between competing models .",
    "placing constraints on the nature of the long - term spectral variability is educative and feasible with current instruments .",
    "a @xmath95  too observation of the seyfert  1 08  was triggered when it was discovered with  in 2009 that the agn was in an x - ray weak state .",
    "here we conducted an analysis of the x - ray spectrum and the long - term variability by combining data of the agn from previous epochs when it was in a bright state .",
    "08  is fitted with various physical models ( blurred reflection and partial covering ) .",
    "while no model is conclusively dismissed the blurred reflection model nicely describes the long- and short - term variability in a consistent manner .",
    "the two classes of models predict distinguishing characteristics that could be revealed with deeper observations ( i.e. high signal - to - noise and broader energy band ) of 08  in the low - flux state with current x - ray observatories . in the future",
    ", such observations will be much simpler .",
    "the high - energy imaging capabilities and calorimeter resolution of _ astro - h _ and _ ixo _ will provide the opportunity to simultaneously measure the broadband spectrum while achieving high spectral resolution below @xmath67 , and _ nustar",
    "_ will be the first to image the high - energy band .",
