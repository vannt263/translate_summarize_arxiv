    "theoretical scenarios beyond the standard model [ sm ] which will be tested at the lhc  @xcite often include a hidden sector .",
    "the standard sector and the hidden sector are coupled by interactions of gauge - invariant operators which open the gate for exploring structures in the hidden sector by observing phenomena in the visible standard sector .",
    "an attractive realization of this idea is provided by the higgs portal which connects the higgs fields in the two sectors by an elementary quartic interaction  @xcite . such a setup moves a precision study of the higgs sector  @xcite into a central position of new physics searches at the lhc .",
    "starting from a wide range of higgs observables at the lhc  @xcite its focus will naturally be on measurements of higgs masses , couplings and , to a lesser extent , higgs self - interactions particularly in cascade decays  @xcite .",
    "the key observables which allow for such an analysis are production rates for different decay channels combined with the weak boson fusion process  @xcite and the recently revived associated production channels with decays to bottom pairs  @xcite . for higgs masses between 120 and 160  gev the lhc , running at a center - of - mass energy of 14  tev and collecting integrated luminosities in the @xmath0 range , can detect uncorrelated modifications to individual higgs couplings of the order of 30% to 50%  @xcite .",

    "valuable additional insight we can obtain from standard higgs properties like masses and visible decay branching ratios .",
    "the fundamental question whether a higgs portal with noticeable interactions between standard and hidden sector exists or not , can be answered this way .    in this extended analysis",
    "we systematically explore the maximum information that can be obtained on the higgs portal and the associated standard and hidden sector states from established higgs search strategies  @xcite , _",
