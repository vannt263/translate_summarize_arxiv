    ". an integrated global estimate of the redshift of reionization assuming a sudden transition ( @xmath3 ) stems from measured large scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb , @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations of the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect on the cmb anisotropies have given a model dependent constrain on the duration of reionization @xmath4 with reionization beginning at @xmath5 at 95% cl ( @xcite ) .",
    "limits on the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) column have been inferred from optical and near - infrared ( nir ) spectra of luminous objects , where a trough blueward of ly@xmath6 appears for @xmath7 ( the `` gunn - peterson trough '' ) .",
    "neutral fraction is difficult to infer over a wide range of @xmath8 owing to the high absorption cross section and ready saturation .",
    "however , inference may be drawn from modeling of the ly@xmath6 damping wing , including the effective radius of the proximate ionized zone .",
    "as of this writing , only two quasars are known for @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , the most distant at @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "troughs have also been observed toward gamma ray bursts , and there are 3 known for @xmath11 , up to @xmath12 ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "broad sky coverage may be limited by nature ",

    "+   +   + ]    the @xmath1321 cm transition of hydrogen at high redshift has not yet been detected , but as it would trace the diffuse igm horizon to horizon without the need for illuminating compact objects , study of this transition has the potential to provide a new avenue by which to infer the evolution of the igm and source populations .",
    "this tracer complements cmb studies and optical / nir spectroscopy and spectral - line origin in principle allows discrimination by redshift , possibly into the dark age .",
    "the physics of the @xmath1321 cm transition has been described in reviews ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) , but we summarize here salient points , referring to figures[dc ] and [ ac ] .    following recombination , the igm cooled ( adiabatically ) faster than the cmb .",
    "when there was effective collisional coupling between @xmath1321 cm transition and gas temperature , the line will be seen in absorption against the cmb ( both in the sense of a sky average and fluctuations ) .",
    "this occurred for @xmath15 , when gas density was high , but before the first stars .",
    "coupling faded with expansion of the universe , reducing contrast between the hi line and cmb .",
    "with early star formation , leakage of lyman photons into the igm recoupled the spin and kinetic temperatures via the wouthysen - field effect , resulting in a second absorption signature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption depth and redshift of the minimum depend on the extent and evolution of heating sources ( e.g. , star formation , x - rays from black holes , shocks ) , which may involve `` exotic '' physics ( e.g. , dark matter annihilation ) . eventually , igm heating drives the hi signature into emission before the hi component is largely destroyed ; in this regime , the sky - averaged and fluctuations signal will be more extended in fractional redshift and weaker in magnitude .",
    "sensitivity to the anticipated unpolarized mk signal will be limited by systematics .",
    "these will arise principally from errors in instrument calibration and foreground models subtracted from the data .",

    "a careful instrumental design coupled with a polynomial fit has been demonstrated to be effective in foreground subtraction ( @xcite ) . however , uncertainty in antenna gain patterns ( e.g. , in response to the environment ) and unmodeled responses of electronics have thus far limited sensitivity to the global 21 cm signal other than for sudden reionization ( @xcite ) .    for dipole arrays , a higher degree of calibration is possible , benefitting efforts to detect @xmath1321 cm fluctuations , or total power via array elements capable of measuring calibrated total power .",
    "bright compact sources are used to calibrate direction and frequency dependent instrument response , and they may be subtracted directly from visibility data ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "foregrounds are mapped in parallel and , given a smooth and slow variation with frequency , galactic diffuse emission and sub - confusion level point sources can in principle be filtered ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) provided that calibration errors do not result in pixel to pixel spectral fluctuations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "equivalently , calibration errors can couple a fraction of the polarized emission from galactic sources into the unpolarized visibilities ( as noted above ) , contaminating the @xmath1321 cm signal ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for idealized models of sky and instruments , it has been possible to filter out the polarization leakage by identifying the effects of different faraday screens along various lines of sight and subsequently filtering the data ( @xcite ) .",
    "active areas of investigation are in correction of ionospheric distortions ( @xcite ) , wide field polarization ( @xcite ) , correction for antenna gain patterns ( @xcite,@xcite ) and direction dependent deconvolution ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "arrays thus far reflect a diversity of architectures , which is a consequence of incomplete knowledge of the low - frequency sky , complex coupling of dipole elements to the sky ( and man - made transmissions ) , and uncertainty regarding optimization of foreground subtraction .",

    "equivalently , the available computing budget where signal processing is implemented with general purpose platforms ( e.g. , bluegene , gpus ) constrains what rf hierarchies are practical .",

    "the narrow @xmath233.3@xmath36 field of view ( fov ; half - power ) of the dishes has enabled the experiment to begin without wide - field polarization calibration and correction for ionospheric distortions .",
    "the target field is centered on a pulsar and in a novel calibration scheme , gated visibilities ( pulsar on  off ) are differenced , thus eliminating the other ( unswitched ) foregrounds and simplifying phase and polarization calibration ( @xcite ) .",
    "foreground subtraction has thus far depended on fitting a frequency linear baseline on 0.5 and 2  mhz scales in visibility space , leveraging the anticipated smooth spectrum of the foregrounds ( @xcite ) .",
    "twenty - three high frequency ( 120 - 240mhz ) lofar stations are arranged in the @xmath233 km core for use by the eor experiment .",

    "the large number of baselines will enable detection of many calibrators per snapshot , a running estimation of the many , variable tile gain patterns , and correction during gridding of visibility data .",
    "source subtraction down to nearly the confusion limit will be accomplished via peeling in visibility space and image - based forward modeling will enable deconvolution ( @xcite,@xcite ) . among eor projects ,",
    "so great reliance on image - based processing is unusual , but if successful , it may be relevant to much larger arrays , for which the volume of of visibilities , @xmath37_o_(n@xmath38 ) , may preclude traditional techniques .",
    "paper comprises 64 broadband dipoles ( 100 - 200mhz ) with plans to build out to 128 or 256 ( @xcite ) .",

    "<S> there are few data available with which to constrain the thermal history of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) following global recombination . thus far , most constraints flow from analyses of the cosmic microwave background and optical spectroscopy along a few lines of sight . </S>",
    "<S> however , direct study of the igm in emission or absorption against the cmb via the 1s hyperfine transition of hydrogen would enable broad characterization thermal history and source populations . </S>",
    "<S> new generations of radio arrays are in development to measure this line signature . </S>",
    "<S> bright foreground emission and the complexity of instrument calibration models are significant hurdles . how to optimize these is uncertain , resulting in a diversity in approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss recent limits on line brightness , array efforts including the new large aperture experiment to detect the dark ages ( leda ) , and the next generation hydrogen reionization array ( hera ) concept .    </S>",
