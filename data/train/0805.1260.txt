    "the spectrum , origin , and composition of crs at the highest energies ( @xmath6 ev @xmath7 eev ; hereafter uhecrs ) has been a puzzle since their discovery almost 50 years ago ( for a review see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the isotropy of the arrival directions of uhecrs above @xmath8 ev suggests an extragalactic origin , though galactic objects such as fast rotating neutron stars with ultrastrong magnetic fields ( `` magnetars '' ) are capable of accelerating particles up to @xmath1@xmath4 ev @xcite .",
    "the uhecr energy losses due to photopion production on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  the so - called gzk effect @xcite  mean that the sources of the highest energy particles should be cosmologically close , within @xmath1@xmath9 mpc .",
    "however , observations of the spectrum at these high energies are extremely challenging due to the low overall event rate ( @xmath11 per km@xmath10 per century at @xmath1@xmath4 ev ) .",
    "fine structure in the cr spectrum above @xmath8 ev has been predicted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the gzk cutoff , a pile - up bump , and a dip due to photoproduction of pairs  and indeed found in experiments , but the interpretation is not straightforward due to the large uncertainty in the source distribution , their injection spectrum , and cr chemical composition .",
    "quite a few extragalactic objects discussed in the literature are potentially capable of accelerating uhecrs . among those are shocks from the epoch of the large scale structure formation , @xmath5-ray bursts , galaxy clusters , agn ( in particular , those agn with powerful jets ) and powerful agn flares @xcite , the lobes of giant radio galaxies @xcite , and newly born magnetars in other galaxies @xcite ; various exotic top - down scenarios have also been discussed but seem unlikely ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "extragalactic jets and their extended radio lobes have been proposed as one of the most likely acceleration sites of uhecrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we , therefore , will follow the `` jet paradigm '' , i.e.  assume that uhecr particle acceleration takes place in jets or is associated with them . however , not all agn have jets , and for those that do the jet properties may differ substantially between different classes / types ( see a discussion in  [ agn_ph ] )",
    ".    there are also quite a few `` known unknowns '' which affect the distribution of the arrival directions of uhecrs and make the association with particular classes of objects a non - trivial task . among these are the source distribution , the structure of extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields , the nature of sources ( transient vs.  steady ) , and the energy spectrum and chemical composition at injection ( we discuss these topics in  [ propagation ] ) .",
    "the auger collaboration has reported significant evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy signal suggests a correlation of the events with agn listed in the @xcite catalog with distances less than @xmath1100 mpc , though other sources with a similar distribution are not ruled out .",
    "the maximum correlation has been found for agn with redshift @xmath11 ( corresponding distance @xmath12 mpc ) , angular separation @xmath13 , and events with energy above @xmath157 eev .",
    "the list of events with energy in excess of 57 eev consists of 27 events , and 20 of these correlate with the agn from the @xcite catalog .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the possible association between uhecrs and agn based on a detailed analysis of a selected sample of nearby active galaxies contained within the @xmath14 search radius of the uhecr events detected by auger , drawn from the @xcite catalog , with additional agn taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "our study of the properties of the selected sample of agn , described here in detail , shows that it consists predominantly of low - luminosity sources such as seyfert galaxies and liners , and a handful of radio galaxies .",
    "in  [ agn_ph ] we give a brief introduction ( not intended as a comprehensive review ) into the agn phenomenology targeting non - expert readers ; those familiar with the agn background material could safely skip it . in  [ agn_sample ] we discuss a sample of local agn selected using exactly the same criteria ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) for each uhecr event that correspond to the maximum significance of the correlation reported by the auger collaboration .",
    "we extend the search out to redshifts @xmath16 which doubles the distance to 150 mpc , and effectively covers the range of horizons for super - gzk particles @xcite .",
    "with such a sample , we investigate the properties of the listed 54 active galaxies .",
    "in particular , we address the two following issues : ( i ) are the selected objects different in any respect from the other numerous local agns ? ( ii ) are they in general able to accelerate cosmic rays to ultra high energies ? based on the selection criteria , we identify four powerful radio galaxies which could be potential sources of , at least , 7 out of 27 reported uhecr events .",
    "we complete with the discussion of the propagation of uhecrs from the sources to the observer (  [ propagation ] ) , and argue that the correlation radius between the arrival direction of uhecrs and the sources could be significantly larger than @xmath14 found by the auger collaboration and depends on the uhecr source distribution and the assumed model of intergalactic and galactic magnetic fields . in  [ conclusion ] we summarize our reasoning that the observed correlation is most probably chance coincidence given the high density of low power agn in the local universe .",
    "a number of weak agn in the local universe can be observed and even resolved due to their proximity which allows a broad range of agn activity to be studied , while only bright ones can be seen at large distances . at the current state of our knowledge , however , not all agn types could be recognized as potential sources of uhecr .",
    "a brief introduction into the types of agn activity is , therefore , warranted as a basis for further discussion .",
    "supermassive black holes ( @xmath17 ) are found in a number of galaxies , and there is growing consensus that all galaxies contain accreting black holes at their centers .",
    "if the emission of the accreting / circumnuclear matter is pronounced , the galaxy is classified as active .",
    "such emission includes a non - stellar blue continuum due to the accretion disk and strong , but narrow , forbidden emission lines resulting from photoionization of the surrounding gas by the disk radiation .",
    "it has been shown that about @xmath18 of all galaxies ( and , in particular , almost all nearby late - type galaxies ) possess detectable emission - line nuclei , which therefore could be classified as agn @xcite . in most cases , however , the nuclear luminosity is very weak relative to the stellar radiative output of the host galaxy .",
    "these nearby low - luminosity agn can be divided into seyfert galaxies ( @xmath19@xmath20 of local agn ) and liners ( @xmath1@xmath21 ) , depending on the ionization level and intensity of the emission lines . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to the recent review by @xcite",
    ".    the rest of the local agn assemblage is populated by radio galaxies ( mostly low - power ones of the fr  i type ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) . in these sources ,",
    "the radiative output of the accreting / circumnuclear gas ( which may , spectroscopically , resemble closely the seyfert or liner types ) is dominated , or at least substantially modified , by a broad - band non - thermal emission produced by relativistic jets emanating from the active centers .",
    "also , radio galaxies and bl lacs are hosted almost exclusively by giant elliptical and s0 galaxies , while the majority of seyferts and liners ( @xmath19@xmath22 ) are associated with spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , seyferts / liners and fr  is / bl lacs are _ morphologically different _ and this may have important consequences / implications for their capability of accelerating particles to the highest observed energies , as discussed in the next section .    some fraction of agn exhibit in addition broad permitted emission lines ( @xmath23kms@xmath24 ) in their spectra ; the presence / absence of such lines divides further the agn population into type  1/type  2 classes . in the framework of the `` agn unification scheme '' ,",
    "these two classes are intrinsically identical , and differ only in the orientation of the accretion disk symmetry axis to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "namely , type  1 agn are thought to be predominantly observed at small inclination angles ( roughly @xmath25@xmath26 ) , while type  2 agn are viewed at larger angles through a high - column - density gas and dust concentrated at pc - scale distances from the active center in a torus - like structure ( co - planar with the inner accretion disks ) . as a result ,",
    "the disk continuum and broad emission lines produced very close to supermassive black holes are heavily obscured in type  2 agn , but not in type  1 sources .",
    "the narrow line emission , originating at larger distances ( @xmath0  pc ) from the active center , is not subjected to strong obscuration .",
    "such a unifying picture is supported by several observational findings , including detections of strong mid - infrared ( mir ) emission due to the dusty obscuring tori in basically all different classes and types of agn .",
    "in addition to the mir / optical / uv non - stellar nuclear radiation , seyferts and liners show characteristic x - ray emission extending from @xmath27 kev up to @xmath9 kev photon energies with photon indices @xmath28 , which is probably produced within the hot coronae of the accretion disks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the low - energy ( @xmath29 kev ) segment of this continuum is typically obscured in type  2 sources , which agrees with the unification scheme .",
    "we also note that in the framework of the unification paradigm , all bl lacs are considered to be simply low - luminosity radio galaxies ( fr  is ) viewed at very small viewing angles ( @xmath30 ) to the jet axis .",
    "acceleration of particles to ultrarelativistic energies in agn is observationally confirmed ( through detection of the intense non - thermal emission ) to be associated with collimated fast jets , which are produced by the active black hole / accretion disk systems - ray emission observed from seyferts is best modeled assuming a thermal population of electrons , albeit characterized by high temperatures of the order of @xmath9 kev . ] , or in shocks created by a propagating jet .",
    "the strong magnetization , extremely low density , non - stationary relativistic and supersonic flow pattern , and finally turbulent character of such jets ( see , e.g. , the review by * ? ? ? * ) , is expected to result in the formation of non - thermal particle energy distributions extending up to the highest accessible energies .",
    "indeed , the very high energy @xmath5-ray emission detected from blazars , demonstrates the ability of the nuclear ( sub - pc scale ) relativistic agn outflows to efficiently accelerate electrons up to @xmath31 tev energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of large ( kpc)-scale jets ,",
    "as observed in powerful radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars , it has been speculated that proton energies in the @xmath32 eev range can be reached as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "not all agn are jetted .",
    "also , it seems that only some fraction of nuclear jets can remain relativistic and well - collimated during the propagation through the dense environments of the central parts of host galaxies .",
    "these issues are particularly relevant for seyferts and liners , which differ substantially from the bona fide jet sources like radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars , lacking in particular well - defined large - scale jet structures",
    ". we also note in this context , that no galaxy classified as seyfert or liner has been detected so far at @xmath5-ray ( @xmath0mev ) energies - ray satellites ( _ fermi_/large area telescope [ _ fermi_/lat ] ) and ground - based cherenkov telescopes ( such as the next phases of hess , _ major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov telescope _",
    "[ magic ] , or _ very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system _ [ veritas ] ) . ] .",
    "the jet production and acceleration efficiency may depend on the _ morphology _ of the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite proposed that the difference in the efficiency of the jet production between spiral - hosted agn ( seyfert galaxies and liners ) and elliptical - hosted ones ( low - power fr  i radio - galaxies , their more powerful analogs classified as fr  ii radio sources , bl lacs , quasars ) may be explained if the spin of the central supermassive black holes , @xmath33 , in spiral galaxies is on average lower than in elliptical ones .",
    "according to the so - called `` spin paradigm '' , the efficiency for the production of relativistic jets in agn depends on the spin of the supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "this has been investigated in detail by @xcite , who , by means of numerical simulation , confirmed that indeed the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes is expected to lead to such a host morphology - related spin dichotomy .",
    "if true , this may have important consequence for the acceleration of crs to the highest observed energies .",
    "namely , the electromotive force of the black hole embedded in an external magnetic field @xmath34 ( supported by the accreting matter ) is @xmath35 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath36 is the maximum value of the black hole spin , and @xmath37 is the gravitational radius of the black hole .",
    "assuming further that the magnetic energy density close to the black hole event horizon is equal to the energy density of the matter accreting at the eddington rate , the maximum energy a test particle with an electric charge @xmath38 can reach in such a potential drop is @xmath39 ev .",
    "if this picture is correct then many ( most ) of the local low - power agn with @xmath40 and accreting at sub - eddington rates , and are additionally characterized by @xmath41 as expected in the case of the spiral - hosted seyferts / liners , may not have enough potential to accelerate crs to ultra high energies @xcite .",
    "jet activity always manifests itself as non - thermal synchrotron radio emission produced by ultrarelativistic jet electrons .",
    "hence , investigation of jet properties are usually addressed by detailed radio studies .",
    "in the case of local agn , like seyferts and liners , such studies are hampered due to the low luminosities and small sizes of the radio structures .",
    "additionally , most of these sources , and in principle all local spiral - hosted agn , show intense star formation activity ( especially pronounced in the far - infrared [ fir ] ) , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "such activity is known for producing the radio - emitting outflows due to starburst - driven superwinds which , although completely different in origin , may in some ( morphological and spectral ) respects closely resemble jet - related activity .",
    "thus , care must be taken when making any statement regarding jet properties in these objects with limited radio data .",
    "the synchrotron / jet origin of the compact cores observed in local low - luminosity agn is supported by the direct detections of nuclear jets in these systems @xcite .",
    "interestingly , observations of the proper motions of such structures indicate sub - relativistic bulk velocities on sub - pc / pc - scales , @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "note that the observed brightness temperatures of the radio cores in seyferts and liners , as well as their moderate year - timescale variability , do not require relativistic beaming @xcite .",
    "also , the observed one - sidedness of nuclear jets in these systems is best explained as resulting from free - free absorption of radio photons on the surrounding gaseous disks , and not due to relativistic ( doppler ) effects @xcite .",
    "this constitutes a clear difference with the established properties of radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "we also emphasize that the distribution of nuclear jets in seyferts and liners is random with respect to the host galaxy stellar disks @xcite .",
    "moreover , misalignments between sub - pc / pc - scale jets and kpc - scale radio structures are common in seyferts , being much larger than those observed in other radio - loud agn @xcite .",
    "the misalignment angle distribution is flat over the whole range @xmath43 to @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that kpc - scale radio structures are not powered by the jets , but rather originate in starforming regions .",
    "such an interpretation is sometimes supported by the fact that the extended radio - emitting halos in some seyferts and liners are aligned with the galaxy disks , and that their radio powers correlate with the fir fluxes as observed in regular spiral and starforming galaxies @xcite .    however",
    ", in most of the cases ( @xmath45 ) the observed kpc - scale radio structures of seyferts and liners do not morphologically match those of galaxy disks or starforming regions , showing also excess radio emission over the radio - fir correlation @xcite .",
    "thus , such structures are believed to be powered directly by jets , which are , however , substantially different from the ones observed in other radio - loud agn . in particular",
    ", there is growing consensus that seyferts and liners are characterized by short - lived low - power jet activity epochs , with jet lifetimes @xmath46 yrs and jet kinetic luminosities @xmath47 erg s@xmath24 , possibly triggered by minor accretion episodes , which repeat every @xmath1@xmath48 yrs in different ( random ) directions over the whole seyfert - type activity epoch @xmath49 gyr @xcite .",
    "radio surveys of local seyferts and liners provide further insight into the nature of their activity and reveal typically complex , multi - component radio structures , consisting of compact unresolved or slightly resolved cores ( detected at centimeter wavelengths in most of these objects ) , linear jet - like features ( observed in @xmath1@xmath50 of the local low - luminosity agn ) , and spherical or elongated diffuse halos / radio bubbles ( present in , again , @xmath1@xmath51 of the seyfert and liner population ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the total radio power of these objects at centimeter wavelengths is in the range @xmath52 erg s@xmath24 ( with median value @xmath53 erg s@xmath24 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is typically slightly higher than the total radio luminosities of `` regular '' spiral galaxies .    for the compact cores of seyfert and liners , previously no dependence in radio power or spectral properties on the agn type ( type  1 vs.  type  2 ) or host galaxy morphology ( ellipticals vs.  spirals ) was found @xcite .",
    "however , more recently it has been suggested that the small fraction of those seyferts which are elliptical - hosted , and possibly also type  1 seyferts , are characterized by relatively stronger nuclear radio activity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is established that flat - spectrum radio cores can be present in all types of local low - luminosity agn , and therefore ( unlike in the case of radio galaxies and quasars ) can not be used as a good proxy for the source inclination .",
    "it has been speculated that the flat - spectrum radio cores of seyferts may not be due to jet activity , but rather some other processes like a nuclear starburst , or the emission of the accretion disks / obscuring tori themselves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the relatively high brightness temperatures of the seyfert radio cores , @xmath54 k , points to a synchrotron ( and therefore jet - related ) origin of the radio emission @xcite .",
    "this is supported by the excess radio emission of the local low - luminosity agn with detected radio cores over the radio  fir correlation established for regular spirals and starforming galaxies @xcite which is expected to hold if the radio emission is exclusively / predominantly due to starforming activity @xcite .",
    "also , recently found scaling relations between the nuclear radio emission of seyferts and liners and their accretion power ( approximated by either the @xmath55 kev luminosity of the disk coronae , non - stellar optical magnitudes of the active nuclei , or h@xmath56 or o  iii line luminosities ) , indicate a strong link between the radio production efficiency and the accretion disk parameters , as expected in the case of a jet origin for the radio emission @xcite .",

    "although the most recent studies have found a correlation between the disk luminosity and the radio power of the unresolved nucleus @xcite , the former has no direct relation with the large - scale radio structures which are supposed to be capable of accelerating crs up to the highest energies . besides , the _ present time _",
    "x - ray luminosity of the disks may have nothing to do with the _ observed _ uhecr events because of the considerable time delay between the arrivals of particles and photons ( see  [ propagation ] ) ; on the other hand , _ past _ uhecr acceleration activity that produced the observed uhecr events , if not episodic , has to manifest itself by extended jets that we should be able to see _ now_. as argued in this paper , the spectral and morphological properties of the _ jetted _ agn which are selected as likely counterparts of the detected uhecr events should be considered in detail and compared with the properties of the parent population .",
    "other possibilities include a few close sources with extended jet / lobe structures , such as cen  a and cen  b , and relatively large deflections due to either stronger magnetic fields or due to the presence of heavy nuclei in the flux , or more distant sources .",
    "observations with @xmath5-ray telescopes , such as _ fermi_/lat , hess , magic , and veritas may point to the _ class of sources _ able to accelerate particles to tev energies , and are therefore potentially capable of accelerating particles up to eev energies .",
    "such sources could also produce tev and uhe neutrinos .",
    "taking into account the delay between the arrival times of @xmath5-rays ( neutrinos ) and uhecrs , such observations have to be interpreted with care : uhecrs may come from sources which are not generating tev @xmath5-rays anymore , or uhecrs that are accelerated in present day @xmath5-ray emitters have not had time to propagate to us , yet .",
    "meanwhile , cen  a and cen  b are two powerful nearby radio galaxies and , if they are indeed uhecr sources , @xmath5-ray observations can provide a `` current '' picture at the time when the crs were emitted since the overall time delay from propagation is very short .",
    "moreover , cen  a is large enough to be resolved by @xmath5-ray instruments ( e.g. , _ fermi_/lat , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , observations with @xmath5-ray telescopes may provide additional clues to the origin of uhecrs .",

    "<S> data collected by the pierre auger observatory ( auger ) provide evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays ( crs ) with energies @xmath057 eev that suggests a correlation with the positions of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) located within @xmath175 mpc and @xmath2 of the arrival directions . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis , however , does not take into account agn morphology . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study of the sample of agn whose positions are located within @xmath2 of the cr events ( and extending our analysis out to @xmath1150 mpc ) shows that most of them are classified as seyfert 2 and low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) galaxies whose properties do not differ substantially from other local agn of the same types . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if the production of the highest energy crs is persistent in nature , i.e. , operates in a single object on long ( @xmath3 myr ) timescales , the claimed correlation between the cr events observed by auger and local active galaxies should be considered as resulting from a chance coincidence . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , most of the selected sources do not show significant jet activity , and hence , in most conservative scenarios , there are no reasons for expecting them to accelerate crs up to the highest energies , @xmath1@xmath4 ev . if the extragalactic magnetic fields and the sources of these crs are coupled with matter , it is possible that the deflection angle is larger than expected in the case of a uniform source distribution due to effectively larger fields . </S>",
    "<S> a future analysis has to take into account agn morphology and may yield a correlation with a larger deflection angle and/or more distant sources . </S>",
    "<S> we further argue that the nearby radio galaxy ngc 5128 ( cen  a ) alone could be associated with at least 4 events due to its large radio extent , and pks  134360 ( cen  b ) , another nearby radio galaxy , can be associated with more than 1 event due to its proximity to the galactic plane and , correspondingly , the stronger galactic magnetic field the ultra high energy crs ( uhecrs ) encounter during propagation to the earth . if the uhecrs associated with these events are indeed accelerated by cen  a and cen  b , their deflection angles may provide information on the structure of the magnetic field in the direction of these putative sources . </S>",
    "<S> future @xmath5-ray observations ( by , e.g. , _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ [ fermi ] formerly _ gamma - ray large area space telescope _ [ glast ] , and _ high energy stereoscopic system _ [ hess ] in the southern hemisphere ) may provide additional clues to the nature of the accelerators of the uhecrs in the local universe . </S>"
