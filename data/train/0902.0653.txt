    "supernova 1987a , the brightest supernova seen in modern times , was a milestone in astronomy and fundamental physics .",
    "the detection of the neutrinos from sn 1987a @xcite , confirmed the basic predictions of the physical mechanisms for type ii supernovae .",
    "the explosion is triggered by the collapse of massive stars .",
    "the core collapse of the massive star ( with mass greater than @xmath6 ) is due to electron capture and photodisintegration , and it is halted when the center density exceeds the nuclear matter density . as the stellar core collapses , the gravitational energy is released through the emission of neutrinos .",
    "a small fraction of these neutrinos is absorbed , and the heating of the neutrinos drives the supernova explosion .",
    "the supernova sn 1987a was observed in every band of the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio to gamma rays , and hence it has a well - measured bolometric light curve . by using both the bolometric light curve and the spectral evolution of its h@xmath7 line ,",
    "the hydrodynamic and time - dependent atmosphere models are consistent with a presupernova radius of 35@xmath8 , an ejecta mass of @xmath9 , an explosion energy of @xmath10 erg , and a radioactive @xmath11ni mass of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the inferred energy ( @xmath13 ergs ) , temperature ( @xmath14 mev ) and decay time ( @xmath15 s ) of the first neutrino burst were not inconsistent with what would be expected from the production of a neutron star through core collapse @xcite . presently , about @xmath16 plausible , or at least possible , associations of pulsars with supernova remnants are known , and these are all relatively young pulsars , mostly with @xmath17 years , where @xmath18 is the first derivative of the pulsar period @xmath19 @xcite . almost immediately after the observation of sn 1987a",
    ", optical attempts were made to identify the compact remnant of the explosion ( see @xcite for a recent review of the optical and x - ray observations on the supernova ) .",
    "the optical searches were done by @xcite , using the high speed photometer system on the hubble space telescope , and by @xcite , using the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope , respectively .",
    "no significant pulsations were observed in the period range of @xmath20 ms to @xmath21 s , with an upper limit for the pulsed emission equivalent to a v magnitude of about @xmath22 .",
    "however , most pulsars are detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "an extensive search was carried out recently at the parkes @xmath23 m radio telescope in 2006 , at frequencies between @xmath24 mhz and @xmath25 mhz , respectively @xcite .",
    "no significant candidate with a signal to noise ratio greater than @xmath26 was observed , and there is no observational evidence for the presence of a central point ( or near point ) source at any wavelength @xcite .",
    "the limit on the luminosity of any point source at the center of sn 1987a is of the order of @xmath27 erg s@xmath4- @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question of why no compact object is observed at the center of the sn 1987a explosion is a rather intriguing one .",
    "several explanations have been advanced to explain the lack of a neutron star/ pulsar .",
    "the most obvious one is that the pulsar may not be beamed towards us @xcite .",
    "the beaming fraction ( fraction of the celestial sphere swept over by the beam as the star rotates ) is not very well determined , but in radio band a beaming fraction of @xmath28 is usually assumed , and for young pulsars it could be even larger @xcite .",
    "however , even if the pulsar were not directed along our line of sight , its radiation would heat the surrounding supernova remnant , and add to its bolometric luminosity . at present , all of the luminosity of sn 1987a can be accounted for by a radioactive decay model consistent with the production of @xmath29 of @xmath11ni @xcite .",
    "it would be also possible that the pulsar magnetic field develops in a few decades , and in this case a rapidly spinning neutron star would be still undetectable @xcite . however , most of the current models assume that the magnetic field is either frozen in the star , or it is generated during the collapse by the dynamo process @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the neutron star further collapsed into a black hole , whose accretion luminosity is below the observational limits @xcite .",
    "although the duration of the neutrino burst of sn 1987a precludes further collapse in the first @xmath30 s , the neutron star could have collapsed eventually into a black hole because of either accretion of a sufficient fall - back mass , or due to some changes in the equation of state of the dense matter @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the collapse of the initially formed neutron star in sn 1987a puts severe constraints on the equation of state of the dense matter",
    ". however , to explain the collapse of a low mass neutron star an exotic equation of state of the nuclear matter is needed , like , for example , an equation of state softened by pion condensation @xcite , which would contradict other observations on supernova remnants . initially , it is likely that neutron stars formed in type ii supernova explosions are obscured by the late - time fallback .",
    "much of this fallback is quickly accreted via neutrino cooling , but some material may remain on the neutron star , forming an atmosphere that slowly accretes through photon emission . if the neutron star has either a low magnetic field , or a low rotational spin frequency , then the neutron star remnant of sn 1987a can not be seen @xcite .",
    "when studying the neutrino data from the sn 1987a explosion a number of unexpected features have been found @xcite .",
    "for example , the angular distribution of the two events , one seen at the kamiokande - ii ( kii ) @xcite and the other at irvine - michigan - brookhaven ( imb ) @xcite are more forward directed than expected .",
    "the average cosines of the polar angles for these two events are @xmath31 , while @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the energy distribution of these two detectors are not in perfect agreement .",
    "the mean energy of the neutrinos detected at kii is around half of the energy of the neutrinos detected at those detected at imb , with a mean energy @xmath33 mev .",
    "the time distribution of the two events is also very different , on average the neutrinos detected by imb came @xmath34 s after those detected by kii ( see @xcite for a summary of neutrino arrival time for various detectors ) . when fitted with thermal spectra",
    ", the two independent detections do not seem to agree with either each other or typical theoretical expectations .",
    "using parameter - free inferential statistical methods , it can be shown that the combined kii and imb data can be best explained by a spectral shape that is enhanced both at the peak and the tail of the spectrum , and depressed in between , as compared to the fermi - dirac spectrum @xcite . since these methods make no _ a priori _ assumptions and do not rely on parameter estimation , they allow for more efficient processing of small data samples . while the supernova neutrino spectra are expected to be quasi - thermal , modifications due to non - standard effects , like neutrino mixing among various flavors , neutrino decay , neutrino - neutrino interactions and/or any novel mechanism due to unknown physics may produce a time - integrated spectrum that deviates significantly from a quasi - thermal shape @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to propose some explanations for the lack of observational evidence for the presence of a point source at the center of sn1987 a , as well as the apparent discrepancy between the two neutrino detections .",
    "since @xcite , following early proposals by @xcite and @xcite , suggested that strange quark matter , consisting of @xmath35- , @xmath36- and @xmath37-quarks is energetically the most favorable state of the matter , the problem of the existence of strange quark stars has been intensively investigated in the physical and astrophysical literature .",
    "the possibility that some compact objects could be strange stars remains an interesting and intriguing , but still open question .",
    "@xcite also proposed two ways of formation of strange matter : the quark - hadron phase transition in the early universe and conversion of neutron stars into strange ones at ultrahigh densities . in the theories of strong interaction",
    "quark bag models suppose that breaking of physical vacuum takes place inside hadrons . as a result vacuum energy densities inside and outside",
    "a hadron become essentially different , and the vacuum pressure on the bag wall equilibrates the pressure of quarks , thus stabilizing the system .",
    "if the hypothesis of the quark matter is true , then some of the neutron stars could actually be strange stars , built entirely of strange matter @xcite . however , there are general arguments against the existence of strange stars , e. g. @xcite . for a general review of strange star properties and the physics of phase transitions see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a possibility for the formation of the quark stars is that some neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries can accrete sufficient mass to undergo a phase transition to become strange stars @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has also been proposed as a source of radiation emission for cosmological @xmath38-ray bursts , soft gamma - ray repeaters or other astrophysical objects @xcite .",
    "some basic properties of strange stars like mass , radius , cooling , collapse and surface radiation have been also studied @xcite .",
    "quark stars are expected to form during the collapse of the core of a massive star after the supernova explosion , as a result of a first or second order phase transition , resulting in deconfined quark matter @xcite .",
    "the proto - neutron star core , or the neutron star core , is a favorable environment for the conversion of ordinary matter to strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss various possible phase transition processes in a neutron star , and to estimate the characteristic time scale for the phase transition .",
    "we suggest that the phase transition from neutron star matter to strange matter in the core of neutron star may be more favorable . in section 3",
    ", we present the numerical simulation results of a phase - induced collapse neutron star .",
    "in particular , we show why high intensity and high energy neutrinos can be emitted after the phase transition . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize the energy dissipation processes of bare strange stars and their cooling . in section 5 ,",
    "we give a brief discussion about how the phase transition may take place in the compact remnant of 1987a and final remarks are presented .",
    "during the formation and evolution of neutron stars new states of matter may form inside the stars as a result of a phase transition , which may be triggered by the accretion of matter , pulsar spindown , collapse of the core of a proto - neutron star in supernova explosions etc . in the following",
    "we shall restrict our discussion only to phase transitions of the first order . as a general physical model we will discuss the nucleation of a phase @xmath39 in the metastable phase @xmath40 .",
    "the nucleation is concerned with fluctuations of parameters , such as the local density or the number of particles in a metastable drop of phase @xmath39 which triggers the phase transition @xcite .",
    "there are two extreme cases of the nucleation theory . in the classical regime , the temperature is assumed to be sufficiently high to trigger the phase transition by thermal fluctuation . in the quantum regime , below a characteristic temperature , thermal fluctuations are negligible as compared to the quantum ones . hence quantum fluctuations can initiate a phase transition via the quantum tunneling effect .",
    "the relevant thermodynamic potential for the description of phase transitions is the gibbs free energy @xcite . in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath41 the excess free energy of a critical droplet .",
    "the probability of a local formation of a droplet of phase @xmath39 via a fluctuation decreases very strongly with the increase of the number of baryons @xmath42 in the droplet . for small @xmath42 ,",
    "however , the positive contribution of the surface energy to @xmath41 prevails over the gain in the bulk binding , @xmath43 , which makes the droplet unstable with respect to the reconversion to phase @xmath40 .",
    "however , at some value @xmath44 , the energy excess due to the droplet formation vanishes , @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the droplets with @xmath46 grow spontaneously , destabilizing the metastable phase @xmath40 and inducing the phase transition @xcite . by using the thermodynamical formalism of nucleation @xcite",
    "one can study the nucleation of exotic phases ( pion condensate , kaon condensate and quark matter ) in the high density neutron matter .",
    "in the following we will briefly review each of these processes .",
    "the nucleation of the pion condensate in the neutron star core and its astrophysical implications were studied by @xcite , respectively , where a theory of metastability of dense neutron matter with respect to the first - order phase transition to a pion - condensed state was also analyzed .",
    "the description of the condensation process is based on the idea of the nucleation of the pion - condensed phase in the metastable normal matter , through the appearance of spontaneously growing droplets of the new phase .",
    "different paths leading from the false to the true ground state of dense neutron matter have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the calculations performed for realistic models of cold neutron matter yield an interval of metastability ( on the time scale of the age of the universe ) , which is as large as half of that between the baryon density @xmath47 , where the metastability starts , and @xmath48 , where the potential barrier ( without surface effects ) between the true and the false ground state vanishes @xcite . in the case of the pion condensation in hot neutron matter ( @xmath49 mev ) the region of metastability ( on the time scale of the gravitational collapse of a massive star ) is much narrower than in cold neutron matter .",
    "consequently , additional energy release and entropy generation from the first - order phase transition in hot supercompressed matter are negligible .",
    "the value of the @xmath50 strongly decreases with the growth of the overcompression @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the lifetime of an overcompressed state decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "for the case of the pion condensation the surface tension can be approximated by the expression derived by @xcite , with the nucleus replaced by a pion condensed droplet , and the neutron gas replaced by the ordinary neutron star matter .",
    "then , one can obtain the condition for the pion condensate in the neutron star core during a time interval equal to the present age of the universe , @xmath53 years . depending on the employed model ,",
    "the required overcompression is @xmath54 or @xmath55 @xcite .    under typical conditions in the neutron star core ( @xmath56",
    "k ) the nucleation proceeds via the quantum tunneling through the energy barrier . at much higher temperatures ,",
    "the thermal effects increase the nucleation rate through thermally excited droplet states . on the other hand ,",
    "the growth of the temperature increases @xmath57 . for a newly born neutron star with @xmath58 k , the nucleation proceeds in the classical ( thermal ) regime @xcite .",
    "due to the softening of the equation of state , pion condensation could lead to a significant decrease of the maximum mass and moment of inertia allowable for neutron star models , constructed using such an equation of state @xcite .",
    "the formation of a droplet of kaon condensate in a neutron star core is connected with the production of strangeness , and nucleation should involve the weak interaction process . the transition from @xmath59-type nuclear matter ( consisting of neutrons , protons , and electrons ) to matter containing strangeness , using a walecka - type model , predicting a first - order kaon - condensate phase transition ,",
    "was studied in @xcite .",
    "the free energy of the droplets of the kaon - condensed matter , as well as the density , temperature , and the neutrino fraction were obtained .",
    "the surface tension of the interface between the normal and condensed kaon phase was calculated by @xcite , using the non - uniform relativistic mean field model . in the approximation in which only linear terms in the curvature of the surface are kept",
    ", the surface contribution to the thermodynamic potential of a spherical droplet is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the surface tension and @xmath62 is the curvature coefficient . for a small admixture of kaon - condensed droplets in a nucleon matter @xmath63 mev @xcite .",
    "the case of the kaon condensation is drastically different from the case of the deconfinement transition , since here there is no intermediate zero - strangeness state , which might allow for the fast nucleation followed by a slow but smooth growth of the strangeness containing fields . instead , the thermal fluctuations responsible for nucleation events must directly involve the weak - interaction processes which produce kaons .",
    "the weak interaction processes producing strangeness via the reaction @xmath64 ( where an additional nucleon @xmath65 is needed for momentum conservation ) and @xmath66 are too slow to create a critical droplet of kaon condensate from a density fluctuation during the fluctuation lifetime @xcite .",
    "strangeness can be produced at a reasonable rate from thermal kaon - antikaon ( @xmath67 ) pairs , but this mechanism can operate only at extremely high temperatures typical for protoneutron stars . generally , a protoneutron star cools so rapidly that kaon condensate has no time to nucleate @xcite .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the minimum energy of a single zero momentum kaon in dense matter , a spontaneous formation of kaons is possible @xcite .",
    "the kinetics of kaon condensation was studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "kaon potentials @xmath70 with values only a little below @xmath71 mev would not be compatible with the mass of the hulse - taylor pulsar , because of a mechanical instability that is initiated by the central densities for which the pressure remains constant , and the necessary condition for stability @xmath72 is not satisfied @xcite .",
    "the kaon condensation process in neutron stars in the framework of the zimanyi - moszkowski model in the relativistic mean field theory was considered in @xcite . even though hyperons which may increase the critical condensation density are not included",
    ", kaon condensation may not occur in stable neutron stars for these classes of mean field theories .",
    "the existence of the antikaon condensation phase in neutron stars in the frameworks of the glendenning - moszkowski and zimanyi - moszkowski models was reanalyzed in @xcite .",
    "the results of this analysis show that in the very massive ( @xmath73 ) , and high redshift neutron stars , there are still some stiff enough equations of state of neutron matter , so that the pure antikaon condensation phase and the mixed phase of normal baryons and antikaon condensation can still exist .",
    "the mass of the neutron star inferred from the neutrino flux of sn 1987a should be of the order of @xmath74 , which suggest that the kaon condensate may not occur in the compact object of the sn1987a .",
    "when quarks seeds are formed in the core of the neutron stars , they will propagate through the entire star , and convert it to the new phase .",
    "a phase transition occurs between the hadronic and quark phase when the pressures and the chemical potentials in the two phases are equal , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 are the pressures and the chemical potentials in the hadron and quark phase , respectively .",
    "if the transition pressure is less than that existing in the supernova core the transition can occur .",
    "the change from the metastable neutron matter phase to the stable quark phase occurs as the result of fluctuations in a homogeneous medium , formed of neutrons , in which small quantities of the quark phase ( called bubbles or nuclei ) are randomly generated .",
    "since the process of creation of an interface is energetically unfavorable , it follows that when a quark nucleus is below a certain size , it is unstable and disappears again .",
    "surface effects disfavor the survival of small bubbles below the radius @xmath80 ( called critical size - the nuclei of this size are called critical nuclei or bubbles ) , which is nothing but the value that extremizes the thermodynamical work @xmath81 necessary to create the bubbles @xcite . only nuclei whose size @xmath82 is above the value @xmath83 are stable , and can survive @xcite .",
    "the nuclei are assumed to be macroscopic objects containing a large number of particles ( quarks ) .",
    "following the phase transition to the two flavor quark matter , the two flavor quark matter will convert into three flavor quark matter through the reactions @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , respectively @xcite .",
    "once the quark phase is formed inside the neutron star , it will propagate throughout the entire star .",
    "the physical mechanisms of the transition from neutron matter to quark matter in an astrophysical background have been studied within several models .",
    "the first is due to @xcite , who used a non - relativistic diffusion model . as such",
    ", this is a slow combustion model , with the burning front propagating at a speed of approximately @xmath21 m/@xmath87 .",
    "this is determined primarily by the rate at which one of the down quarks inside the neutrons is converted , through a weak decay , to a strange quark : @xmath88 .",
    "the second method of describing the conversion process was first suggested by @xcite , and analyzed in detail by @xcite and @xcite , who modeled the conversion as a detonation . in this case",
    "the conversion rate is several orders of magnitude faster than that predicted by the slow combustion model .",
    "this model is based on the relativistic shock waves and combustion theory . but",
    "regardless of the way in which the transformation occurs , an initial seed of quark matter is needed to start the process .",
    "the problem of the combustion of neutron matter is closely related to that of shock waves .",
    "let us assume that we have an unburnt fluid which converts ( by means of a certain reaction ) in a burnt fluid",
    ". the combustion process must be exothermic if it propagates spontaneously to other regions of the fluid .",
    "the condition for spontaneous propagation to other region of the fluid is @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the energy densities of the respective fluids , both evaluated at the same thermodynamic state . in the case of the transition from nuclear to quark matter",
    "this condition can be reformulated as @xmath92 @xcite , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 correspond to nuclear matter .",
    "if this condition is not fulfilled , the combustion is no longer exothermic , and so it is not possible . at low enough densities ,",
    "soft eos verify @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "hence there exists an absolute lower limit for the combustion to be possible , given by @xmath97 \\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ ] @xcite , corresponding to a transition density @xmath98 of the order of @xmath99 \\;\\mathrm{g / cm^{3}}$ ] .",
    "however , it is important to point out that the efficient burning of the nuclear matter can take place only when the nuclear matter density is sufficiently high , and in order to convert the entire neutron star to a quark star a higher density than the minimum one given by @xmath100 is required , and there is always a range of densities at which the transition occurs .",
    "the density for the deconfinement of baryonic matter with a moderately stiff ( or stiff ) equation of state to two - flavor quark matter is near @xmath101 . for a soft equation of state , the deconfinement density may be lower .",
    "generally , the flow behind the detonation is sonic .",
    "therefore the typical time scale for the transition is @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the radius of the neutron star and @xmath104 is the speed of the sound .",
    "a simple phenomenological model for the evolution of the quark phase can be obtained by assuming @xmath105 @xcite , which gives for the transition time scale @xmath106 from a microscopic quark nugget to a quark matter distribution of a macroscopic size the expression @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the neutron star radius in units of @xmath109 cm , @xmath110 ( harko et al .",
    "2004 ) is the initial size of the quark bubble , and @xmath111 is the number of quark seeds inside the core of the neutron star , which could be as large as @xmath112 ( iida & sato 1998 ) .",
    "however , it was found that the conversion process in a hadronic matter at @xmath113 always correspond to a deflagration , and never to a detonation @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical instabilities can develop on the front , and a mixed phase of hadrons and quarks could form . due to the formation of the wrinkles ,",
    "the conversion velocity can significantly be increased , but this increase is not sufficient to transform the deflagration into a detonation . in general , one could assume that the conversion process can take place in two steps , with a first transition from hadrons to ungapped ( or 2sc ) quarks , followed by a second transition in which a cfl phase is produced .",
    "the time scale for the first transition has been estimated by @xcite , and it is of the order of @xmath114 s for the first transition in the case of a laminar front , and is much more rapid if the hydrodynamical instabilities are taken into account .",
    "the second transition lasts only @xmath115 s , due to the formation of a convective layer .",
    "if the two processes take place one after the other , it is even possible that the formation of a diquark condensate could accelerate the conversion process by developing a convective layer inside the hadronic phase .",
    "the neutrino trapping can play an important role in the hadron - quark phase transition @xcite .",
    "the quantum nucleation of a quark matter drop , and therefore the conversion of the hadronic matter to quark matter , is strongly inhibited at @xmath113 by the presence of neutrinos . however , in the high temperature regime , the dominant nucleation mechanism is thermal nucleation , and not quantum tunneling @xcite . in general , it takes a sub - milliseconds time interval to convert the matter at the core of a neutron core into quark matter .",
    "the total energy emitted in the form of neutrinos in a supernova explosion can be easily estimated from qualitative considerations .",
    "the total gravitational energy that can be irradiated is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath103 are the mass and the radius of the star , respectively . by using for the neutron star a mass of the order of @xmath118 , and a radius of @xmath119 km @xmath120 , one obtains @xmath121 erg .",
    "this amount of neutrino energy does not conflict with the observed data .",
    "however , it is difficult to understand why in comparing with kii , imb has detected a neutrino burst with a time delay ( @xmath122 ) and with even higher average energy ( @xmath123mev ) . in discussion section , we will argue that a phase transition may take place after the core temperature of the newly born neutron star is reduced .",
    "the characteristic time scale for the cooling of the core is the neutrino trapping time , which is of the order of several seconds . in this section ,",
    "we use a three dimensional newtonian hydrodynamic code to simulate the neutrino emission from a phase - induced collapse of neutron star .",
    "first we briefly summarize the numerical code used to simulate the collapse of neutron star induced by phase - transition .",
    "the three - dimensional simulations are based on newtonian hydrodynamics and gravity .",
    "the code has been used to study the gravitational wave emission from the phase - induced collapse neutron stars ( lin et al .",
    "we refer the reader to lin et al.(2006 ) for a detailed discussion of the numerical code .",
    "the system of equations describing the non - viscous newtonian fluid flow is given by @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the mass density of the fluid , @xmath128 is the velocity with cartesian components @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) , @xmath19 is the fluid pressure , @xmath131 is the newtonian potential and @xmath132 is the total energy density , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 is the internal energy per unit mass of the fluid . the newtonian potential @xmath131 is obtained by solving the poisson equation , @xmath135 . the system is completed by specifying an equation of state @xmath136 .    the above hydrodynamics equations ( [ eq : rhoeq])-([eq : taueq ] ) can be rewritten in a flux conservative form , which can be solved numerically using quite standard high - resolution shock capturing ( hrsc ) schemes .",
    "an hrsc scheme has the ability to resolve discontinuities ( e.g. shock waves ) in the solution .",
    "it can also achieve high accuracy in regions where the fluid flow is smooth . in our work",
    ", we employ the so - called roe s solver in the simulations ( see lin et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "it is not known what is the equation of state ( eos ) for the neutron star in the remnant of supernova 1987a .",
    "we can try all possible existing realistic equations of state in our study .",
    "however , the main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the phase - induced collapse of a neutron star can emit extremely intense , pulsating and very high energy neutrinos .",
    "therefore instead of using realistic equation of state we will use a polytropic equation of state for the initial neutron star . in section 2 , we have discussed various possible phase transitions for a newly born hot neutron star . although both pion condensate and kaon condensate can not be ruled out completely , there are no compelling observation evidence for the their existence . for simplicity",
    "we will focus our study on the phase transition from neutron star to strange star in this paper .",
    "we use a mixed phase eos to mimic a strange star covered by normal nuclear matter .    in the following",
    "we want to argue that a newly born quark star should be described by a mixed phase eos . in section 2.2",
    ", it has been shown that quark seeds can be spontaneously generated inside the core of neutron star when the density exceed the critical density ( e.g. iida & sato 1998 ) .",
    "these quark seeds formed in the neutron star core can mix with the normal hadronic matter by schwarzschild convection , and the length scale @xmath137 for the convective motion is given by @xcite @xmath138 ^{1/4},\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is the entropy per baryon in units of boltzmann s constant , @xmath140 is the local gravitational acceleration in the core , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the neutrino mean free path , @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the neutrino energy density and @xmath145 the matter density . with @xmath146 cm , @xmath147 , @xmath148 cm / s@xmath149 and @xmath150 cm@xmath4@xcite , one obtains @xmath152 cm .",
    "the timescale of the mixing can be calculated from @xmath153 ms .",
    "therefore the convection will result in the mixing of the neutron and quark phases in the large region of the star during the phase transition process @xcite .    the initial equilibrium neutron star before the phase is given by a polytropic eos @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are constants . on the initial time slice ,",

    ", we have assumed a bare strange star , i.e. a strange star without crust .",
    "this assumption may be justified by the following reasons : on the top of the quark matter , a thin crust can exist as long as the electron density within it is smaller than that in the quark matter @xcite .",
    "such a baryonic crust is , however , much thinner than the neutron star crust .",
    "the mass of the crust on the quark star is at most @xmath388 , because the density of the crust bottom can not exceed neutron drip density , and it may extend to up to @xmath389 m. the normal crust may occur , for instance , due to the accretion of normal matter onto a bare strange star .",
    "the oscillation spectrum of strange stars with crust differs from the spectrum of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "if detected , acoustic oscillations would allow one to discriminate between strange stars with crust and neutron stars , and constrain the mass and radius of the star .",
    "the recent detection of seismic vibrations in the aftermath of giant flares from two magnetars ( highly magnetized compact stars ) is a major breakthrough in observational astronomy .",
    "the oscillations excited seem likely to involve the stellar crust , the properties of which differ dramatically for strange stars .",
    "the resulting mode frequencies for strange stars can not be reconciled with the observations , for reasonable magnetar parameters @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "young and hot strange stars are the source of a powerful pair wind , consisting of electron - positron pairs and photons , created by the coulomb barrier at the quark surface @xcite .",
    "photons dominate in the emerging emission , and the emerging photon spectrum is rather hard and differs substantially from the thermal spectrum expected from a neutron star with the same luminosity .",
    "the total luminosity in the case of a stationary , spherically outflowing , pair winds is in the range of @xmath390 ergs / s .",
    "these results have direct relevance to the emission from hot , bare , strange stars . for @xmath391 erg",
    "/ s , photons dominate the emerging emission . as @xmath392 increases from @xmath393 to @xmath394",
    "ergs / s , the mean photon energy decreases from @xmath395 kev to @xmath396 kev , while the spectrum changes in shape from a wide annihilation line to being nearly blackbody with a high energy ( @xmath397 kev ) tail . such a correlation of the photon spectrum with the luminosity , together with the fact that super - eddington luminosities can be achieved , might be a good observational signature of hot , bare , strange stars @xcite .",
    "at the moment of its formation , a strange star is very hot .",
    "the temperature of the interior may be as high as a few of @xmath398 k. the neutrino luminosity of the young quark star is of the order of @xmath216 erg / s , the rate of mass ejection from such a hot compact object is very high , and the normal matter envelope is blown away by radiation pressure in a few seconds .",
    "high temperatures also lead to a considerable reduction of the coulomb barrier , increasing the tunneling of nuclei through the barrier toward the surface .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that the surface of a young strange star to be nearly ( or completely ) bare @xcite . since the strange quark matter at the surface of the star",
    "is bound via strong interactions rather than gravity , such a star can radiate at the at the luminosity greatly exceeding the eddington limit .",
    "therefore , due to the radiation pressure , a normal matter crust can not be built around a young strange star .",
    "we have also assumed that the phase transition should take place after the neutron star is formed .",
    "we argue that the delay time scale of the phase transition is of order of the neutrino trapping time scale based on the following reasons : the theory of type ii supernovae predicts the gravitational collapse of a degenerate core on timescales of the order of @xmath399 s , followed by the formation of a hot ( @xmath400 mev ) protoneutron star , with a radius of around @xmath401 km , composed of @xmath402 baryons , and with the electron lepton number @xmath403 @xcite .",
    "the initial mass of the collapsing core is @xmath404 , where @xmath405 g is the mass of the @xmath11fe nucleus , divided by 56 .",
    "the gravitational mass of the protoneutron star is only slightly lower than @xmath406 , because the gain in the gravitational energy is compensated by the increase of the internal energy contained mostly in the strongly degenerate neutrinos @xmath407 , trapped in the stellar interior .",
    "the diffusion time - scale of the neutrinos may be estimated by assuming that coherent scattering is the dominant opacity source , so that @xmath408 , where @xmath409 is the mean free path in the sea of heavy nuclei ( @xmath410 ) and @xmath411 is the number of scatterings experienced by the neutrino prior to escape . by taking into account the explicit expressions of the neutrino mean free path and of the number of scatterings , the neutrino diffusion time can be written as @xmath412 s. at sufficiently high densities @xmath413 @xcite .",
    "the two timescales becomes comparable at @xmath414 , a condition which is satisfied at a density @xmath415 g/@xmath416 .",
    "neutrino trapping has enormous implications for the core collapse . for @xmath417 ,",
    "most of the neutrinos from electron capture remain in the matter , and the lepton number per baryon does not change .",
    "the neutrino distributions approaches an equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the neutrino luminosities are greatly reduced by trapping .",
    "once the center of the core exceeds nuclear densities of the order of @xmath418 g/@xmath416 , thermal pressure and nuclear forces cause the equation of state of the matter to stiffen , preventing further collapse .",
    "most of the gravitational binding energy of the core is released in the form of neutrinos , following the collapse to nuclear densities . in the absence of neutrino",
    "trapping , the total binding energy would be completely emitted as neutrinos in a collapse timescale , the time for the core to contract from @xmath419 to @xmath420 , where @xmath421 km for @xmath422 .",
    "accordingly , the neutrino luminosity would then achieve its maximum possible value , @xmath423 erg / s @xcite . in reality , neutrino trapping forces the liberated gravitational potential energy to be emitted on a much longer diffusion timescale , @xmath413 at @xmath424 . as a result ,",
    "the actual neutrino luminosity is of the order @xmath425 erg / s .",
    "thus during the advanced stages of the collapse , the neutrinos are unable to stream freely out of the core . the bulk of the liberated gravitational energy must therefore be converted into other forms of internal energy ( e.g. thermal energy , energy of the excited nuclear states , bounce kinetic energy etc . ) , rather than being released immediately in the form of escaping neutrinos .    in order for the phase transition to take place in the neutron star",
    ", the density inside the core must satisfy the condition @xmath426 , as discussed in section 2 .",
    "since the core temperature during the neutrino trapping period is very high , the thermal pressure will give a significant contribution to the total pressure , thus lowering the central density of the neutron star , so that @xmath427 . in order to satisfy the thermodynamical conditions for the phase transition",
    ", the core must cool down so that the core density increases . to estimate the density increase resulting from the temperature decrease in the core of the neutron star we solve the tov equation by using a temperature dependent eos , i.e. shen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , to obtain core density as function of temperature for a fixed stellar mass . in implementing this eos",
    ", we have added an ideal electron gas contribution .",
    "we have also imposed the condition of beta equilibiurm to determine the electron fraction .",
    "the left panel of fig.9 shows the energy density profiles for a star model with @xmath428 at different temperatures .",
    "note that the temperature profiles are determined by the general relativistic isothermal condition .",
    "the right panel of fig.9 shows the results for a neutron star with @xmath429 . in fig.9",
    ", we can see that indeed when core temperature decreases by a factor of 2 , the core energy density can increase by more than 20% .",
    "we can see that these changes are sufficiently large to trigger the phase transition when the core temperature decreases after the neutrino trapping time scale .",
    "we conclude that the abnormally high energy neutrinos and the time delay detected by the imb detector can be explained by the neutrino trapping in the newly formed very hot neutron star , followed by a phase transition .",
    "after phase transition if the compact object is a neutron star with exotic matter core , its surface luminosity is lower than @xmath3erg / s and it should have black body thermal spectrum with temperature @xmath430k . on the other hand",
    "if it is a bare strange star , its surface luminosity is also lower than @xmath3erg / s but the radiation spectrum is a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with temperature @xmath431k .",
    "however , the nature of the phase transition can not be inferred from the present data , since the observed features can not differentiate or discriminate between the different phase transition models .",
    "we suggest that the future observations on spectral features of the compact remnant of 1987a could provide better clues to elucidate the nature of the phase transition that might take place in sn1987a .",
