    "random polymer models have been used for a long time by physicists to describe a large variety of physical phenomena . among the numerous models that have been introduced by theoretical physicists and rigorously studied by mathematicians ( see e.g.  @xcite for a survey of the most studied polymer models ) , the polymer pinning model , that involves a simple random walk interacting with a defect line , has focused a lot of interest both of the mathematics and physics community .",
    "the phase transition phenomenon between a pinned phase and a depinned one is now well understood , even in presence of disorder ( see @xcite for a seminal paper concerning the homogeneous case , and @xcite for recent reviews ) .    on the other hand , dynamical pinning ( which has some importance in biophysical application see @xcite and references therein ) has attracted attention of mathematicians only more recently and a lot of questions concerning relaxation to equilibrium and its connection properties are still unsolved .",
    "the object of most of the mathematical studies on the dynamical pinning model up to now ( see @xcite ) has been the mixing time and the relaxation time for the dynamics .",
    "it has been shown there that the mixing property of the system depends in a crucial way of the pinning parameter @xmath3 , or more precisely , on whether the polymer at equilibrium is pinned or unpinned .    in the present paper , we choose to study a different aspect , that is , the dynamical scaling limit of the height - profile of the polymer .",
    "we start from an initial condition that is very far from equilibrium and approximates a macroscopic deterministic profile and we want to describe the evolution of the profile under diffusive scaling .",
    "our aim is to show that the nature of the limit of the rescaled process depends only on whether one lies in the pinned or depinned phase , and to describe explicitly the scaling limit in each case .",
    "the scaling limit is easier to guess in the unpinned phase . as in this case",
    ", there is no contact point with the substrate at equilibrium , one can infer that the scaling limit is the same that for a system with no substrate , for which it is known that the height profile converges to the solution of the heat - equation on the segment with zero dirichlet boundary condition .    in the pinned phase",
    ", a more interesting phenomenon takes place . in this case",
    "the dynamical picture should be the following : there are macroscopic region where the polymer is pinned to the substrate and other regions where the polymer stays at a macroscopic distance from it ; the boundary between the pinned and the unpinned region is moving in time and in the unpinned region , the polymer profile evolves according to the heat - equation .",
    "the system reaches equilibrium when the unpinned region has totally vanished .    in the present paper , we prove that this picture holds when the pinning parameter is infinite ( or tending to infinity sufficiently fast with the size of the system ) .",
    "an important step to establish this result is to prove existence and regularity of the free - boundary problem that appears in the scaling limit .",
    "the free - boundary problem of unknown @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the function and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the boundary of the unpinned region ) that appears as the scaling limit of the pinning model in the pinned phase is the following    @xmath8\\setminus ( l(t),r(t)),\\\\ f_x(l(t),t)=- f_x(r(t),t)=1,\\\\ l'(t)=- f_{xx}(l(t),t),\\quad   r'(t)=f_{xx}(r(t),t),\\\\ f(\\cdot,0)=f_0,\\ l(0)=l_0,\\ r_0 . \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    we are exclusively interested in the case of a @xmath9-lipshitz initial condition that vanishes outside of the interval @xmath10 $ ] and is positive inside .",
    "this problem belongs to the class of stefan problem , which have been introduced in mathematics to describe the evolution of a multiphase medium .",
    "the boundary condition for @xmath11 and the fact that the heat equation preserves lipshitzianity imply that @xmath5 can not be convex in the neighborhood of the moving boundaries , and thus the boundary points @xmath12 and @xmath13 are moving towards each other ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "these problems with contracting boundary are referred to as _ freezing _ problems whereas those with expanding boundary are called _ melting _ problems .",
    "most of the work in the literature on stefan problems concerns melting problems .",
    "one of the reason for this is that these problem can be rewritten as a diffusion equation for an enthalpy function with a diffusion coefficient that is monotonous increasing function of the enthalpy .",
    "this monotonicity allows to derive uniqueness of the solution with some generality ( we refer to the introduction of @xcite for more precision ) .",
    "the freezing problems like on the contrary are more challenging even in the one dimensional setup .    even though one dimensional freezing problems have attracted some attention in a recent past @xcite , some amount of work",
    "is required to establish the existence and the unicity of a solution to up to a maximal time .",
    "to introduce our reader to polymer dynamics , we first introduce the simplest version of the model where no substrate is present : this is the so - called corner - flip dynamics .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the set of all lattice paths ( polymers ) starting at @xmath17 and ending at @xmath17 after @xmath18 steps    @xmath19    the stochastic dynamics is defined by the natural spin - flip continuous time markov chain with state space @xmath20 .",
    "namely , sites @xmath21 are equipped with independent poisson clocks which ring with rate one : when a clock rings at @xmath22 the path @xmath23 is replaced by @xmath24 , defined by @xmath25 for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 one denotes by ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , the trajectory of the markov chain . by doing linear interpolation between the integer values of @xmath22",
    ", one can consider @xmath28 as a function of the real variable @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the unique invariant measure for this dynamics is the uniform measure on @xmath31 , and thus , from standard properties of the random walk , when the system is at equilibrium , the rescaled interface @xmath32}$ ] is macroscopically flat ( @xmath33 has fluctuation of order @xmath34 ) . for this model ,",
    "relaxation to equilibrium is well understood both in terms of mixing - time ( see wilson @xcite ) or scaling limits ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) , weaker versions of these result had been known before , using connection with the one dimensional simple symmetric exclusion process ) .",
    "we cite in full the result concerning the scaling limit for two reasons : it gives some point of reference to better understand results in presence of a substrate ; and we use it as a fundamental building brick for the proof of our new results .",
    "given @xmath35 a lipshitz function in @xmath36 $ ] , with @xmath37 , set @xmath38 defined on @xmath36\\times [ 0,\\infty)$ ] to be the solution of the heat equation with dirichlet boundary condition    @xmath39    [ frefer ] [ dynsanw ] let @xmath40 be the dynamic described above , starting from a sequence of initial condition @xmath41 that satisfies , @xmath42 then , under diffusive scaling , @xmath40 converges to @xmath38 in law for the uniform topology : for any @xmath43 , in probability , @xmath44,t\\in [ 0,t ] } \\left|\\frac{1}{l}{\\widetilde}\\eta^l(lx , l^2t)-{\\widetilde}f(x , t)\\right|=0.\\ ] ]    the notation in equation means that there exists a function @xmath45 tending to zero such that for all @xmath22 and @xmath1 @xmath46 we keep this notation for the rest of the paper .",
    "let us now define precisely the model that is the object of study of this paper .",
    "our aim is to understand how the pattern of relaxation to equilibrium given by theorem [ frefer ] is modified ( or not modified ) when the dynamics has additional constraints .",
    "we focus on the case of an interface interacting with a solid substrate .",
    "this brings us to consider a dynamics with the following modifications :    * we consider that a solid wall fills the entire bottom half - plane so that our trajectories have to stay in the positive half - plane ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) . *",
    "the wall interacts with the interface @xmath23 so that the rates of the transitions that modifies the number of contacts with the wall are changed .",
    "more precisely one starts from a trajectory that lies entirely above the wall , i.e.  which belongs to the following subset of @xmath49 : @xmath50    the rates of the transitions from @xmath23 to @xmath24 are not uniformly equal to @xmath9 as in the previous section but they are given by    @xmath51    the generator @xmath52 of the markov process is given by    @xmath53    the value of the parameter @xmath54 $ ] determines the nature of the interaction with the wall . if @xmath55 , the transitions adding a contact are favored , which means that the wall is attractive , whereas if @xmath56 the wall is repulsive .",

    "* when @xmath70 , @xmath23 has a lot of contact with the wall ( order @xmath34 ) but the longest excursion away from the wall has length of order @xmath1 .    for more precise statements and proofs",
    ", we refer to chapter 2 in @xcite .",
    "these three cases are respectively referred to as the depinned or unpinned phase , the pinned phase , and the critical point ( or phase transition point ) .",
    "the case @xmath71 , that will be also considered in this paper is a bit particular . indeed , as seen in , when @xmath72 ( when @xmath23 touches the wall at @xmath22 ) , it sticks to it forever , so that @xmath73 stops moving once it has reached the minimal configuration @xmath74 defined by @xmath75 which is the configuration with the maximal number of contact point with the wall . in that case",
    ", the unique invariance probability measure is the dirac mass on @xmath76 .",
    "a question of interest is then to compute the time at which @xmath73 stops to move : the hitting time of @xmath76 .",
    "our aim is to get a result similar to theorem [ dynsanw ] , describing how , starting from a non - flat profile , the system relaxes to equilibrium .",
    "we are able to deduce results in two cases :    * in the depinned phase , when @xmath77 : in that case the scaling limit is the same one as for the model without wall .",
    "the result can be obtained with rather soft comparison arguments when @xmath78 but requires some additional work when @xmath79 .",
    "* when the wall is sticky , @xmath71 : in that case , the attraction of the wall can be seen ot the macroscopic level , and the scaling limit is given by the solution of a partial differential equation with moving boundary : the free bounary problem .    we can understand what happens when @xmath70 ( the critical point ) and when @xmath80 ( the pinned phase ) at a heuristic level , and formulate this as conjectures ( see section [ secconj ] ) .",
    "there are a lot of technical reasons why bringing these conjectures to rigorous ground can not be done only we the ideas exposed in this paper .",

    "this result is not much of a surprise .",
    "for this range of @xmath3 , the wall is pushing the trajectory @xmath23 away , so that for most of the time @xmath85 lies in the wall - free zone .",
    "this is the reason why the effect of the wall does not appear in the scaling limit .",
    "we believe that this also to be the case for @xmath70 , but the fact that @xmath34 contact with the wall can appear at equilibrium instead of @xmath86 brings an additional technical challenge .",
    "we move now to the case @xmath71 . in that case (",
    "recall ) , the corners on the interface flip with rate @xmath9 if it does not change the number of contact with the wall , with rate @xmath87 if it adds one contact , and the contacts with the wall can not be removed and stay forever . in that case , it is known that with large probability after a time @xmath2 the dynamics ends up with a path completely stuck to the substrate ( with probability tending to @xmath9 ) , ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "what we want to justify here is that the slope of the scaling limit at the left ( resp .",
    "right ) boundary of the pinned region , given by @xmath96 ( resp .",
    "@xmath97 ) has to be equal to @xmath98 ( resp .",
    "@xmath99 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that , as the scaling is diffusive , the mean - speed of the left - boundary of the pinned zone for the non - rescaled dynamics has to be of order @xmath100 .",
    "this can be achieved only if the density of down - steps near the left boundary is vanishing , and hence if @xmath101 .    combining this boundary condition with @xmath102 , and doing some trigonometry it implies ( at least at the heuristic level ) that one must also have @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "the assumption that @xmath5 is strictly positive in @xmath109 is necessary and if @xmath5 cancels in the middle of the interval , the scaling limit depends on the microscopic details of the initial condition and the scaling limit might be a random object even for a deterministic initial condition .",
    "although we are quite far from being able to prove it , we do believe that theorem [ mainres ] extends in some way to the whole localized phase @xmath121 .",

    "what we believe is that the polymer consists of one ( or several ) unpinned region situated a macroscopic distance of the interface , and pinned regions where the polymers looks locally at equilibrium ( recall that when @xmath122 the polymer has a density of contacts for @xmath123 . as before it is natural to say that in the unpinned region , the rescaled polymer must satisfy @xmath124 .",
    "however , the argument giving the slope of @xmath5 at the boundary of the unpinned region in the @xmath71 case is not valid when @xmath3 is finite , because the boundary can now microscopically move in both direction as unpinning is allowed .",
    "to guess the value of the slope at the boundary @xmath125 , @xmath126 , we assume that the system close to the phase separation must be in a state of local - equilibrium .    from the equilibrium results on polymer pinning with elevated boundary condition proved in @xcite , one can infer that the equilibrium slope of a polymer at the boundary of a pinned and an unpinned phase is @xmath127 and that one must have @xmath128    hence , the scaling limit @xmath5 of @xmath129 with @xmath122 must satisfy the following free boundary problem    @xmath130\\setminus ( l(t),r(t)),\\\\ f_x(l(t),t)=- f_x(r(t),t)=d_{{\\lambda}},\\\\ l'(t)=- f_{xx}(l(t),t)/d_{{\\lambda}},\\quad   r'(t)=f_{xx}(r(t),t)/d_{{\\lambda}},\\\\ f(\\cdot,0)=f_0,\\ l(0)=l_0,\\ r_0 . \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    the problem presents additional technical difficulties when compared to , even though the difference between them is just a scaling factor .",
    "the reason for this is comes from the kind of initial condition that one wants to consider .",
    "if one starts from an initial condition that is positive in @xmath109 and lipshitz with lipshitz constant @xmath131 , then theorem [ existence ] ensures that the solution to exists and is well behaved until the time when the pinned region has vanished .",
    "however , if one consider a @xmath9-lipshitz boundary condition , @xmath132 can be positive for some times , and thus the boundary are not necessarily contracting ... which makes the problem more difficult to solve .    when the wall is sticky , there is no loss of generality in considering that there is only one unpinned region , because two regions separated by a contact with the wall stay separated and behave independently . when @xmath133 the situation is different : if one starts with two distinct unpinned regions @xmath134 and @xmath135 with @xmath136 , this is possible that the two region merge at a positive time .",
    "besides these obstacles on the analytical side , there are many reasons why the proof of theorem [ mainres ] can not easily be adapted to the case @xmath80 .",
    "indeed a part of the strategy relies on the control of the area below @xmath23 ( see for instance lemma [ drifta ] ) and this kind of argument seems very difficult to adapt when the polymer is allowed to detach itself from the wall .",
    "free boundary problems similar to appear naturally in thermodynamics to describe the motion of phase boundary in a multiphase medium ( e.g.  water in solid and liquid state ) , and for this reason have been the object of extensive studies ( see the seminal paper of stefan @xcite and @xcite for a survey the subject ) .",
    "there has been then some recent efforts in the area of statistical mechanics in order to prove to show that stefan problem can be obtained as the limiting equation of evolution for particle systems whose microscopic behavior is random . among these work",
    "we can cite @xcite , where chayes and swindle have exhibited a particle system whose hydrodynamic limit is given by a stefan problem , and @xcite where landim and valle proposed a microscopic modeling of stefan freezing / melting problem and proved the weak convergence of the particle density to the solution of a free boundary equation ( for a more complete bibliography we refer to the monograph @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference of the problem we study here when compared to the one considered e.g.  in @xcite and @xcite is that , microscopically , the motion of the phase boundary does not depend only on the state of the system close to the boundary , but on the whole configuration ( a contact to the wall can be added anywhere and not only near the boundary ) .",
    "this makes control of the boundary motion more difficult , and for this reason we did not use an approach based on weak convergence like in most of the literature , but something based on a classical interpretation of the partial differential equations .",

    "of course a consequence of this modification is that the initial condition does not satisfy , and we have to find an equivalent formulation proposition [ lb ] that deals with this problem : this is proposition [ infdelta ] .                    instead of proving proposition [ lb ] , we prove a similar statement where @xmath5 is replaced by @xmath542 . somewhere in the proof",
