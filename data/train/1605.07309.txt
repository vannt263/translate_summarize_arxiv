    "polymer bonded magnets have opened a new world of application opportunities in the sensor and electric drive technology @xcite . by modification of thermosoftening plastic with hard magnetic filler particles it is possible to manufacture polymer bonded permanent magnets . as hard magnetic particles , ferrite ( e.g. sr , ba ) as well as",
    "rare - earth materials ( e.g. ndfeb ) with a volume filler content between 45 - 65% are inserted .",
    "first , the polymer and the magnetic particles are compounded in a twin - screw extruder .",
    "then , the obtained compound can be further processed with injection molding and extrusion , respectively @xcite .",
    "ndfeb powder for polymer bonded magnets can be produces by a melt spinning process .",
    "this produces ribbons or flakes with a size about 200 m @xcite .",
    "inert gas atomization processes produce spherical powder with a particle size of approximately 45 m @xcite , which is usually preferred in injection molding processes to achieve better rheological behavior .",
    "whenever a high maximum energy product @xmath1 of the bonded magnets is not the most significant characteristic value , magnetically isotropic powder is preferred because it comes with lower assembling costs and more flexibility .",
    "conventional magnets are mainly produced by sintering , and hence limited in the complexity of their shapes .",
    "due to procedural advantages of plastic technologies , polymer bonded hard magnets enable the manufacturing of complex shapes and features by design flexibility regarding shape and magnetizing structure .",
    "however , @xmath1 of these magnets is barely half of sintered one , as well as these technologies are only affordable , and economically reasonable for mass production of permanent magnets @xcite",
    ". currently , no single - unit production technologies are available to produce magnets with complex structures .",
    "for that reason , we present in this work a novel cost and time effective manufacturing process for polymer bonded rare - earth magnets with an arbitrary shape .",
    "since 3d printers are nowadays affordable for end - users , a boom of new possibilities has been triggered .",
    "3d print technology is a fast growing field for single - unit production , and it allows to produce structures that have been historically difficult or impossible to build , like holes that change direction , unrealistic overhangs , or square interior cavities .",
    "for injection molding of highly filled plastics , the fluidity of the matrix material is essential .",
    "this is due to rising filler content which increases the viscosity of the compound leading to filling problems in the cavity .",
    "for this reason , the matrix material should be of a high flowable material as well as good mechanical properties .",
    "polyamide has a good combination of these properties , and is therefore suited for the processing of highly filled plastics . especially polyamides such as pa6 , pa11 , and pa12 are commercially relevant @xcite .    in our case a prefabricated compound ( neofer@xmath0 25/60p ) from magnetfabrik bonn gmbh",
    "neofer@xmath0 25/60p is a compound of ndfeb grains with uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy inside a pa11 matrix .",
    "the orientation of the ndfeb grains is random leading to isotropic magnetic properties of the bulk magnet .",
    "the powder is produced by employing an atomization process followed heat treatment .",
    "thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ) measurement yields a filler content of 90wt% .",
    "the magnetic datasheet values of the material are listed in tab.[tab : hyst ] . to determine the shape and size of the ndfeb particles , scanning electron microscope ( sem ) images",

    "the extrusion is performed with a leistritz zse 18 hpe-48d twin - screw extruder , and a sikora laser series 2000 diameter measuring system to control the diameter tolerances of the filament .",
    "an important aim of this work is to manufacture isotropic ndfeb permanent magnets with high dimensional accuracy .",
    "we use a commercially available fused deposition modeling printer .",
    "this system creates the object layer by layer by a meltable thermoplastic .",
    "the wire - shaped plastic is first heated to just above its softening point . with the aid of an extruder , and a movable , heated nozzle the object is built up in layers on the already solidified material on the building platform @xcite .",
    "we choose the builder 3d printer from code p. the maximum building size is 220@xmath3210@xmath3164 mm ( l@xmath3w@xmath3h ) , the layer height resolution is 0.05 - 0.3 mm .",
    "the nozzle diameter is 0.4 mm , and it is fed with filaments with a diameter of 1.75 mm . to control the printer , the open - source software repetier - host and slic3r are used . for the optimal printing results with the ndfeb compound material , which is described above , the best empirically found printing and slicer parameters are listed in tab .
