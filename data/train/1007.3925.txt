    "the emission of coherent synchrotron radiation by @xmath0  @xmath1 shower particles in the earth magnetic field provides a measurable broadband signal from 10  mhz-150  mhz on ground @xcite .",
    "the south  pole site with its dedicated infrastructural environment and a limited number of radio sources is possibly one of the best places in the world for the detection of air  showers by their low frequency radio emission .",
    "another feature of the south pole site in comparison to other radio quiet regions in the world is the possibility to make studies in coincidence with other astrophysical experiments like the neutrino detector icecube and the air shower detector icetop .",
    "icecube is a neutrino detector @xcite embedded in the antarctic ice .",
    "one of the main aims of icecube is to measure neutrinos from cosmic sources .",
    "the strategy of icecube is to measure up - going particles from the northern hemisphere . only neutrinos or other weakly interacting particles are not absorbed by the earth and are able to interact in the south pole ice and produce measurable particles like muons .",
    "icetop is built on the surface above icecube ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "it is designed to detect cosmic air showers from @xmath2  ev up to @xmath3  ev .",
    "+    this special environment leads to two different options with different focus for a radio air shower detector on top of icecube and its ambit @xcite .    * an * infill detector * built up of radio antennas on the same footprint as icetop in similar distances but shifted with respect to the tank array .",
    "this provides an additional powerful observation technique in cosmic ray research of air showers at the south  pole . it would be possible to study air showers by three independent detector systems , icetop , icecube and the radio detector . *",
    "an * areal expansion of icetop * with radio surface antennas is an extension of the air shower detector to higher energy primary particles and to higher inclination angles @xcite .",
    "the idea is to build an antenna array in rings with increasing radius around the icetop array .",
    "for ultra - high energetic neutrinos , @xmath4  tev , the neutrino nucleon cross section is large enough for absorption in the earth to become increasingly important . for cosmogenic neutrinos , produced by the gzk mechanism , for example ,",
    "most of the signal comes from near the horizon .",
    "thus muon bundles induced by air showers can be misinterpreted as a neutrino signal in the icecube detector .",
    "the role of an antenna array field expansion of the icetop detector is to detect these air showers with high inclination angle as a veto for the icecube detector .",
    "initial background measurements with a single antenna in 2006 indicated a continuous electromagnetic background promising a low detector threshold @xcite . together with air shower simulations of the radio emission the background measurements seem to allow the detection of air showers with a threshold lower than 10  pev in primary energy . the study presented here is aimed at long - term studies of the electromagnetic background for several months to investigate the amount of pulsed radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and potential long - term variations in the continuous background .",
    "the data acquisition of the rice experiment , constructed to investigate radio detection methods of high energy neutrinos in ice @xcite , is suited to be extended by four surface antennas .",
    "the rice daq consists of 6 oscilloscopes with 4 channels each .",
    "the sampling rate of each channel is 1ghz .",
    "the dynamic range of the scopes is @xmath52  v with 12  bit digitization .",
    "+ three different kinds of trigger are implemented in rice :    1 .",
    "unbiased events every 10  min which is a forced read out of all channels .",
    "2 .   the rice simple multiplicity trigger .",
    "it is read out if the signal in four or more rice antennas is above a threshold .",
    "the threshold is calculated at the beginning of every run to be 1.5 times above the rms of unbiased events .",
    "these events should have no signal over threshold in the surface antennas .",
    "3 .   the rice surface trigger .",
    "this is a rice simple multiplicity trigger with one or more surface antennas above the threshold as part of the trigger .",
    "this includes rice triggers where only surface antennas have a signal over threshold .",
    "the first and the third kind of trigger are of great interest for the surface radio background studies .",
    "the second trigger strategy is interesting to understand the in - ice rfi not reaching the surface .",
    "it is the most interesting event class for the rice neutrino detection .",
    "+ in total four surface antennas were deployed in the south pole season 2008/2009 on the icecube footprint ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .            two fat wire dipole antennas ( fig .  [ fig05 ] )",
    "are connected to rice with rg59 signal cables ( 1505a coax ) of the decommissioned spase experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "these broad band antennas allow for measurements in the frequency range from 25 - 500  mhz .",
    "figure  [ fig02 ] shows measurements of the voltage standing wave ratio ( vswr ) of a fat wire dipole lying on the antarctic snow in its final position compared to simulations of the antenna using the nec2 software package @xcite .",
    "the frequency response is already well described by simulations without snow ground .",
    "the connection with the spase cables allows measurements over distances of several hundred meters from the mapo building on the icecube footprint , housing electronics , which is a potentially large rfi source , and the antennas on its roof . to compensate for the attenuation of the long signal cable ( ca .",
    "40  db at 75  mhz ) 60db low noise preamplifiers ( miteq au-4a-0150 ) are implemented between antenna and signal cable .",
    "the power is transmitted through the same cable using bias tees . to avoid saturation of the preamplifiers by the input power ,",
    "25  mhz high pass filters and 300  mhz low pass filters were implemented between amplifiers and fat wire dipole antenna .",
    "the antennas near the spase building are lying on the snow surface orthogonal to each other .",
    "thus they measure orthogonal polarization of the signals .",
    "the other two antennas are deployed on the roof of the mapo building .",
    "these four arm dipole antennas with an amplification of about -2  db at @xmath670  mhz are difficult to calibrate in the surrounding of the mapo building and thus will only be used for event reconstruction ( fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] ) .",
    "the signal of the antennas on the roof of the mapo building are amplified with 39  db preamplifiers ( au-1464 - 400 ) .",

    ".antenna position and cable delays to the rice daq . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "from the technical point of view one can divide the analysis of the data into two parts .",
    "the reconstruction of the origin of rfi events seen in more than two antennas will indicate possible noise sources at the south pole e.g. the icecube counting house or the south pole station . a map of these sources will help to improve air shower detection . + a @xmath7 minimization on time residuals",
    "is used to reconstruct the source location of single events . to test the event reconstruction algorithm",
    ", we use signals generated with a ghz horn antenna in front of the mapo building . considering the cable delays and the antenna positions ( table  [ table1 ] )",
    "we are able to make a 3d and time reconstruction of the events .",
    "figure [ fig04 ] shows the reconstruction with horn antenna signal data is working well .",
    "it is accurate within several meters and shows clearly the horn antenna lies in front of the mapo building near the antenna mapo1 .",
    "the horn antenna data reconstructs to the actual position within 50  m with an rms of 2.3  m. figure [ fig08 ] shows a typical noise event triggered with the rice surface trigger .",
    "the event can be nicely reconstructed to have its origin in the building of the 10  m telescope which is the topmost building in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] .",
    "another topic is the rate and variation of the different rfi sources during a whole year of measurement .",
    "it is expected that rfi events have a typical signature in the frequency domain .",
    "this will help to find an ideal frequency region for a radio air shower detector .",
    "the continuous background is monitored over a whole year using the unbiased rice events .",
    "one of the highest peaks on top of the continuous radio background is expected to be the meteor radar at 46.6  mhz to 47.0  mhz and 49.6  mhz to 50.0  mhz @xcite .",
    "it is clearly observable in the dft of the recorded data together with a few other expected sources of filterable continuous narrow band rf signals .",
    "+ the dft of the constant background measured with the fat wire dipoles is the basis to evaluate the limit of detectable signal strength . for this",
    "it is of great importance to correct the measured data for the antenna properties , the high- and low pass filtering , the amplifier response , and the attenuation of the signal cable .",
    "another important topic will be to determine long term variations of the background during one year .",
    "+ rice triggered surface events are studied in the frequency domain whether a discrimination of air shower radio signals from rfi noise is feasible .",
    "most of the narrow band noise events could e.g. be filtered in a future air shower detector system .",
    "the four crosses indicate the position of the antennas on the roof of the mapo building ( 18 m above the snow ) and on the snow surface near the spase building .",
    "the dots are reconstructed positions of triggered signals from a ghz horn antenna , measured with all four antennas .",
    "the reconstructed events are in very good agreement to the transmitter position in front of the mapo1 antenna and demonstrate the potential of the instrument . ]",
    "as a part of rice the four antenna surface detection system for radio signals , is able to study the conditions of the radio background in the frequency range from 25 - 150  mhz and higher at the south pole .",
    "the threshold trigger strategy together with rice allows for the estimation of the amount of rfi noise and its sources on the icecube site .",
    "an analysis of the signals in the frequency domain shall be used to develop strategies to suppress the false trigger rate of a radio air shower detector .",
    "measurements of the continuous background and its variations are the basis to estimate the energy threshold of a radio air shower detector in different frequency bands",
