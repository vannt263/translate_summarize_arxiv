    "owing to its proximity ( @xmath5pc ; @xcite ) , @xmath0 pictoris is one of the best studied examples of a main sequence ( ms ) star with a circumstellar dust disk .",
    "@xmath0 pic was shown to have a substantial mid- and far - infrared excess through observations using the infrared astronomical satelite ( iras ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , believed to be indicative of thermal radiation from @xmath2100 k dust orbiting the star .",
    "follow - up imaging by @xcite revealed an almost edge - on system with circumstellar nebulosity due to light scattered from the dust around the star .",
    "since then , many investigators have mapped the surface brightness and color of the disk in optical wavelenghts @xcite .",
    "the extensive studies of the disk have also revealed several asymmetries in the scattered light contours produced by the dust surrounding @xmath0 pic .",
    "these were summarized by @xcite and include : 1 .",
    "the size asymmetry - the north - east ( ne ) extension of the disk stretches further out from @xmath0 pictoris than the south - west ( sw ) extension , 2 . the surface brightness asymmetry - the brightness profile along the disk s spine ( midplane ) is broader for the ne than the sw extension , 3 . the width asymmetry - the sw extension is thicker than the ne extension , 4 . the wing tilt asymmetry - the two extensions of the disk are not perfectly aligned ( i.e. the difference in the position angles of the midplanes of the opposing extensions is less than @xmath6 ) and 5 .",
    "the butterfly asymmetry - isophote curvature is asymmetric across the midplane of the disk , with the asymmetry itself inverted across the minor - projection axis .",
    "several attempts have been made to explain why these asymmetries arise .",
    "@xcite noted that the size and surface brightness asymmetries might be a direct result of the width asymmetry .",
    "since the sw extension of the disk is more vertically extended , the sw midplane might appear fainter then the ne midplane and thus explain why the latter appears to have a larger radial size .",
    "further insight into the @xmath0 pic system has come from optical and mid - infrared observations of its disk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite imaged the disk with high - resolution hst optical cameras and detected a warp in the inner part of the disk ( @xmath220100 au from @xmath0 pic ) indicating the presence of a secondary disk inclined at @xmath7 to the primary @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite noted that the projected spine of the secondary is aligned with the isophotal inflections ( the butterfly asymmetry ) reported at large distances from the star .",
    "@xcite also placed constraints on the brightness profiles along the spines of the primary , secondary and composite ( combined primary and secondary ) disks .",
    "they found that the primary disk has a steeper midplane profile than the secondary at greater distances from the star and that the composite profile is best described with four power laws , in contrast to previous modelling efforts that employed two power laws ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) . to probe the regions of @xmath0 pic s disk inaccessible with optical instruments",
    ", @xcite imaged the disk in the mid - infrared ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "they reported a set of rings embedded in @xmath0 pic s disk whose radii vary from 14 to 82au and whose configuration suggests the presence of multiple planets .",
    "however , the ring structure is uncertain , since @xcite failed to observe them in scattered light .",
    "strong motivation for the study of dust distribution in disks is spurred by the fact that such a study reveals important clues about the presence of unseen larger bodies ( planetesimals and planets ) .",
    "for example , it was suggested that the hst warp @xcite is caused by the presence of a giant planet on a slightly inclined orbit less than 50au from the primary ( ex .",
    "this prediction was possibly vindicated recently by the announcement of an @xmath9 candidate companion separated by 8au from @xmath0 pic , which , if confirmed , would make it one of the first planets imaged orbiting an a type ms star , and the planet imaged with the smallest projected physical separation to - date @xcite .",
    "the system s many peculiarities have yet to be adequately explained , and thus continued studies of the dust distribution are a necessity that might lead to the discovery of additional companions .",
    "given the possibility of dust migration @xcite and/or dust avalanches @xcite , the dust and the planetesimal / planet distributions may not be the same . however , detailed modeling of micron - sized dust including its dynamical interaction with radiation and dust - dust collisions , is a prerequisite for understanding the distribution of larger bodies .",
    "our work provides the first step for such prospective modeling , the description of the dust distribution .",
    "in this paper we present the best - fit two - disk model to the images obtained by @xcite . in section 2",
    "we discuss the model assumptions as well as the acs images that are used for the fitting procedure .",
    "we dedicate section 3 to the results and section 4 to the discussion and analysis .",
    "we use an axisymmetric multi - parameter model to describe the distribution of the dust surrounding @xmath0 pic . its simplicity and the fact that it has been successfully applied in the past on more than one occasion ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) allow one to quickly proceed from the numerical development stage to testing the model on astronomical data .",
    "the improvements on the previous applications of the multi - parametric model include the introduction of an additional axis of rotation ( which allows us to model disks whose axis can point in any direction ) , implementation of a @xmath1 minimization algorithm ( in this case a markov chain monte carlo method ) and the addition of the secondary disk which we fit simultaneously with the primary .",
    "furthermore , recent @xcite observations have produced the most photometrically accurate maps to date which allow one to probe dust distribution in all directions ( specifically at large scale heights ) , allowing one to introduce additional constraints on the model .    in order to describe the dust distribution , we follow @xcite .",
    "we assume that both disks are axisymmetric . in cylindrical co - ordinates ( @xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12 ) then , the scattering cross section per unit volume is given by :    @xmath13    this form arises as a result of the vertical exponential drop off of the dust density .",
    "the rate of this drop off is determined by the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the width profile :",
    "@xmath16    this profile guarantees that the disk is thicker at greater radii than at smaller radii .",
    "if @xmath17 , the flare index , is more than 1 , the disk will flare .",
    "the scale height @xmath18 ensures that the disk has a specific thickness to radius ratio at @xmath19 , the location of the power law break describing the vertical optical thickness .",
    "the vertical optical thickness is proportional to the function @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath20 has the following dependance on distance from the centre of the star : @xmath21    the inner radial index @xmath22 and the outer radial index @xmath0 suppress the vertical optical thickness below and above the characteristic radius @xmath23 .",
    "only two indices are used since the midplane surface brightness profile of the primary disk is known to have a single break and thus requires two power laws to describe it ( @xcite ) .    to compare the brightness contours produced by our model with images of @xmath0 pic s disk , we convert the cylindrical symmetric dust distribution into the observed brightness isophotes in the following manner . light intensity along the line of sight through the disk is given by :    @xmath24    here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the pixel co - ordinates of an image and l is the depth along the line of sight . in the above equation , flux entering a unit volume having co - ordinates ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) is @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 denotes the luminosity of @xmath0 pic at frequency @xmath29 .",
    "this luminosity , along with the distance to the @xmath0 pic , is hidden inside our normalization parameter @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 represents the phase function and is described in section 2.2 .",
    "the formulae for @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 as functions of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath32 follow from the appropriate co - ordinate transformations .",
    "@xmath33^{1/2}\\ ] ]    @xmath34    @xmath35    the theoretical image obtained via the described transformation will show a disk that is aligned with the major projection axis .",
    "angle @xmath36 is introduced so that this image can be rotated around the line - of - sight until it is aligned with a disk , which may not lie along the major projection axis ( which is certainly the case for the secondary ) .      in order to obtain a theoretical image",
    ", one must also include a phase function [ @xmath31 in equation 4 ] which describes how the light is scattered in different directions compared to the line - of - sight by the orbiting dust .",
    "for our simulations we used two scattering profiles , the empirical zodiacal @xcite and the henyey - greenstein @xcite .",
    "the former profile describes light scattered by the midsized particles ( 10 - 100@xmath37 ) with rough surfaces @xcite and it strongly favors forward scattering .",
    "the empirical zodiacal is proportional to : @xmath38    the henyey - greenstein scattering profile is an analytical phase function commonly used to describe light scattered by small grains : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the profile asymmetry parameter .",
    "positive values of @xmath41 produce forward scattering , negative backward while @xmath42 gives us the isotropic scattering . in fig.[scat ]",
    "we present the zodiacal light and several henyey - greenstein phase functions . in the simulations ( as well as fig.[scat ] ) the phase functions are normalized so that their intergrals over the full solid angle are equal .",
    "this is done so that a meaningful comparison can be made between @xmath30 parameters obtained from different simulations .          in order to constrain the two - disk model of @xmath0 pic s dust distribution",
    ", we use the @xcite acs hubble space telescope ( hst ) images .",
    "the acs excellent optics and hst s well studied psf allow one to produce images whose quality ( photometric accuracy and morphological details ) are unparalleled by any other hardware combination currently in operation .",
    "furthermore , the acs wide field - of - view ( fov ) [ @xmath43 , its ability to access large scale heights [ @xmath44 circular coronographic mask only blocks out the innermost 30au ] and its ability to use three filters [ f435w(b ) , f606w(broad v ) and f814(broad i ) ] to probe chromatic dependence introduce additional constrains on our model that would have been impossible with previous observations .    to discriminate between the features in the image associated with the disk and those intrinsic to the coronographic psf of the disk and @xmath0 pic itself , @xcite observed the disk at two roll angles and obtained images of a star with similar colors ( @xmath22 pic ) prior to every exposure . following the appropriate subtractions ,",
    "the combined images were deconvolved with synthetic psfs produced by the tiny tim software package . throughout the reduction process @xcite",
    "keep track of errors ( both random and systematic ) associated with each pixel .",
    "this allows them to produce meaningful error maps that include both the systematic and statistical uncertainties in their data ; we use these error maps for our @xmath1 minimization .",
    "the number of data points in these images once the coronograph ( inner 30au ) is masked out is 563136 .",
    "we employ markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ; @xcite ) fitting as described for our purposes in @xcite .",
    "mcmc fitting is a computationally efficient method to perform a full bayesian analysis of complicted problems where one is required to fit a great number of often correlated parameters .",
    "mcmc fitting effectively samples the posterior parameter distribution by performing an n - step intelligent random walk around the @xmath45-dimensional paramater space of interest , while recording the @xmath46 at each point in the intelligent random walk .",
    "in addition , mcmc fitting allows one to explore correlations in one s fitting - parameters - the end result is that one is able to return realistic best - fit and error estimates even if the parameters of interest are correlated .",
    "mcmc fitting is thus well - suited to fit the @xcite observations of the @xmath0 pic disk with our model as it features a large number of parameters ( @xmath45=18 - 20 parameters for the two - disk case ) a select number of which display modest correlations .",
    "flat priors in all parameters are used .",
    "we run our mcmc chains until the @xcite statistic is close to unity for all parameters .",
    "to determine our best - fit and 1-@xmath47 uncertainties , we use the marginalized likelihood method as described in @xcite .      given the large number of data - points ( @xmath48500000 ) in the acs images of @xmath0 pic and",
    "the impressive accuracy of this data minute changes in one s model will result in a statistically significant increase in @xmath46 .",
    "these small increases in @xmath46 indicate a statistically significant poorer fit in the case that one s model is an accurate representation of the physical reality of the disk in this case .",
    "however , in our case it should be noted that even in the best - case scenario our model is likely only an approximation of the actual physical makeup of the @xmath0 pic disk ; even our best - case scenario can not account for the numerous asymmetries in the disk ( e.g. figure [ totres9and18 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , although the error estimates provided by @xcite attempt to include both the systematic and statistical uncertanty in the acs data , they could fail to account for correlations in the data that could add an extra systematic component .",
    "for these reasons we feel that a simplistic @xmath1 could underestimate the true uncertainties in our fitted parameters . for these reasons",
    "we have scaled up the uncertainties in our fitted parameters by a factor of 10 , as we believe these give a more accurate indication of the true uncertainty in our data .",
    "in the following sections we discuss optimal parameters for a single and two - disk dust distributions as well as several scattering phase functions . since both the dust distribution and the phase function are responsible for the scattered light profile , both components are investigated here and modelled with our simulations . however , in order to minimize the number of free parameters , we first explore the parameter space using a zodiacal light phase function for scattering . in section 3.3",
    "we expand on our work by exploring other phase distributions .      to test both the fitting procedure and the goodness - of - fit of our two - disk fits , we first constrained the parameters describing the dust distribution via a single disk and a zodiacal light scattering profile .",
    "the zodiacal light profile has been used in the past ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) and was chosen in order to minimize the number of free parameters .",
    "table [ singparcomp ] lists these results as well as those obtained in the past using similar axisymmetric models .",
    "we do not note any significant disagreements and suggest that the minor differences between our and past results might be due to several factors including : 1 . that previous fitting efforts were performed with simpler models ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , 2 . that the previous data used for modelling efforts was of poorer quality , 3 . that various coronographic implementations employed in previous observations did not allow the observer to reliably probe large scale heights , 4 .",
    "the usage of different phase functions and lastly 5 . that past modellers applied trial and error methods to explore the parameter space instead of more sophisticated techniques .",

    "the former is particularly interesting because it can be modified through the scattering asymmetry parameter @xmath41 to produce many profiles , several of which are shown in fig .",

    "the disagreement lies in the slightly higher amount of back scatter produced by the latter , although this is not significant since most of the light comes from forward scattering . in table",
    "[ nineeighteentwenty ] we present the results of our analysis of the two - disk run that allowed for varying scattering asymmetry parameters .",
    "the overall shape of the brightness contours produced by the two - disk model follows that of the light scattered by @xmath0 pic s dust . this is evident from both the isophotal maps ( figure [ tot9and18 ] ) and low @xmath204 fits for the f606w filter images .",
    "similar maps and reduced @xmath1 are recorded in other filters as well .",
    "the brightness contours of the two components ( the primary and the secondary ) is presented in figure [ sepdisks ] and the relative contribution of each component to the total scattered light is shown in figure [ ratioofscatlight ] .",
    "the most striking feature of these fits is that the secondary contributes more light at larger radii and scale heights than the primary .",
    "the immediate implication is that the dust content of the secondary disk is not localized to the inner regions of the system and that it extends at least out to @xmath205 .",
    "we noted earlier that @xcite found a steeper power law fit along the spine of the primary beyond @xmath206 than the secondary .",
    "their result suggests that the secondary will extend further out , at least radially , unless the fit is not appropriate beyond @xmath205 and is in line with our conclusions .",
    "it is also interesting that to describe the brightness profile along the midplane of the composite , @xcite use 4 power laws with power law breaks at 69 , 117 and 193au .",
    "our two - disk model offers an explanation for the locations of the breaks .",
    "the 69 and 117 au breaks correspond closely to the midplane profile breaks of the secondary ( @xmath207 ) and the primary ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "the last power law break according to our model is a result of primary s dust density falling to levels equal to the secondary s density along the line of sight and the contour transitioning to follow the shape of the secondary .    in order to test for possible disagreements with previous ground base observations of the disk which extend out to 800au",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) and do not show two separate components , we extend our model to the same radius . due to the large scale height of the secondary disk in our model , we find that the composite still appears as a single disk at large radial separations ( out to @xmath2800au ) .",
    "furthermore , the primary makes a significant contribution to the total light profile along the spine , having the effect of aligning the composite s spine with its own .",
    "thus , the composite does not show an inclination to the primary at 800au .",
    "the impact of such an extended secondary on dust dynamics in the system is discussed in section 4.3 .",
    "figure [ tot9and18 ] also reveals that the brightness isophotes of the two - disk ( composite ) model are spaced more widely along the northwestern semiminor axis , as can be seen from the greater extension of the isophotes in the northwest direction .",

    "all of our two - disk models agree that the spacing is a result of the secondary s inclination to the line of sight ( @xmath209 vs @xmath210 for the primary which is almost entirely edge on ) .",
    "this is highlighted in figure [ sepdisks ] which maps the isophotes of the scattered light of the primary and the secondary showing that the secondary s isophotes are more widely spaced in the nw than the se , where as the primary fails to shows this asymmetry .",
    "it is also interesting to compare brightness contours of the primary and the secondary at different wavelengths . in figure [ chromratios ]",
    "we present color ratios of the f814w and f435w filters for the primary and the secondary .",

    "the ratios of the primary at different filters ( figure [ chromratios]-middle panel ) do not show this asymmetry , which is expected from an axisymmetric edge - on disk .",
    "our models suggest that it is the secondary which is responsible for the mentioned minor - axis asymmetry ( which is expected considering its much larger inclination to the line - of - sight as well as the primary , which was used to define the major and the minor axis ) .",
    "lastly , we comment on the residuals obtained from the subtraction of the composite from the original image ( figure [ tot9and18 ] ) .",

    "since this structure is detected in the visual and the mid - ir regimes , we do not doubt its existence .",
    "furthermore , if the inner `` ring '' is indeed a structure separate from the two disks , it is not surprising that our simple axisymmetric descriptions fail to account for its presence . unlike the inner `` ring '' , the outer structure has not been previously observed .",
    "this raises a possibility that it is a byproduct of the fitting procedure .",
    "for example , the two - disk fit might be overcompensating for the inner warp by slightly inclining the secondary disk and increasing the overlapping region .",
    "our models fail to identify the 52au ring , confirming the absence reported by @xcite .",
    "high resolution images of dust surrounding @xmath0 pictoris obtained by @xcite , with their excellent morphological detail and photometric accuracy , impose significant constraints on models .",
    "in addition , ratios of acs images before and after deconvolution show that dust around @xmath0-pic is distributed in two separate disks inclined at @xmath215 to each other . a good model should therefore be able to reproduce the morphology with two nearly edge - on disks inclinded by a small angle . as shown already",

    "below we discuss the known asymmetries and the degree to which our model recreates them .",
    "* butterfly asymmetry : the asymmetry first identified by @xcite refers to the asymmetric curvature of the isophotes across the spine of the composite disk and inversion of this asymmetry across the minor axis .",
    "figure [ tot9and18 ] confirms that the two - disk model does a good job of re - creating this feature .",
    "also , since the primary disk is edge - on and nearly identically aligned with the major - projection axis , it is the extended secondary that is responsible for this feature . *    * wing - tilt asymmetry : @xcite noted that the two extensions of the composite disk are inclined to each other by @xmath217 and that the linear fits for their midplanes do not intersect at @xmath0 pic .",
    "this asymmetry was named the wing - tilt asymmetry and is attributed to forward scattering from an inclined disk .",
    "it is also present in the @xcite images , where the inclination of the primary s components is determined to be @xmath218 while that of the secondary s is @xmath219 . also , they note that the primary s linear fits intersect at a point almost coincident with @xmath0 pic , which they note as a point of disagreement .",
    "*    our fits also reproduce this asymmetry ( table [ spinecpstab ] ) .",
    "the inclination of the primary s extensions ( @xmath220 ) , however , is much less than that reported by @xcite , but is consistent with a disk that is edge - on as our model suggests the primary is .",
    "the linear fits of the disk s spine are nearly centered on the star ( figure [ spinecps ] ) in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the secondary s extensions on the other hand are inclined at @xmath221 due to the inclination of this component to the line of sight ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "their fits also intersect close to @xmath0 pictoris . the composite is inclined at @xmath222 , which is less than the inclinatinon of the composite determined by @xcite .",
    "however , the two extensions do not meet at the star , with the ne component intersecting the sw component @xmath223 away from @xmath0 pic along the sw extension .",
    "the fact that the model primary and composite do not agree on the point of intersection is offered as a possible reason for the disagreement between @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our model suggests that it is the combination of the primary and the secondary that together creates the mentioned offset .",
    "* width asymmetry : @xcite find that the fwhm and the full - width-0.1-max ( fw0.1 m ) of the two extensions of the composite diverge beyond @xmath224 and @xmath225 respectively .",
    "this asymmetry , known as the width asymmetry , is present in our fits as well , although to a smaller degree .",
    "figure [ height ] shows the width of the ne and sw components of the composite .",
    "it is evident that the sw component s fwhm is slightly wider than that of the ne component , although not by a significant amount . out",
    "to @xmath226 the two extensions fwhm and fw0.1 m almost overlap , as is the case with the @xcite measurements , but after this point our model disagrees significantly as the @xcite measurements show much more asymmetric behaviour .",
    "the fw0.1 m shows more asymmetric behaviour than the fwhm , as is the case with the @xcite measurements . *        * surface brightness asymmetry : differences in the brightness profile along the spine of the ne and the sw extensions of the composite are presented in figure [ radratio ] . although our model shows asymmetry between the profiles of the two extensions , it does this to a much lesser degree than the scattered light .",
    "*        * radial extent asymmetry : although the radial extent asymmetry could result from the surface brightness asymmetry , @xcite classify it separately to draw attention to the possibility that the sw extension is physically truncated .",
    "this asymmetry , however , becomes evident only beyond @xmath227 and thus we are unable to comment on its true nature . *      in previous sections we presented a case for two axisymmetric disks around @xmath0 pic .",
    "here we explore the dynamical consequences of such a pair .",
    "a quantity of interest is the mean collision time since it reveals the timescales on which the disks are stable , and also on which they have to be replenished . it can be estimated most easily by using our knowledge about the total stellar flux absorbed by dust and re - radiated in infrared , quantified as the ratio of ir excess to star s luminosity @xmath228 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if the absorbing area of grains in a small volume of space is denoted as @xmath229 , then we can normalize our model - derived vertical optical depth functions @xmath230 using @xmath231 we obtain the normalization constants @xmath232 for each disk separately , utilizing the ratio of scattered light in the two disks ( @xmath233 from our models ) and the fact that @xmath234 is due to the sum of the two disks .",

    "we present the conservative number of orbits ( assuming the disks completely overlap ) a particle can make before colliding with another particle as a function of distance , and the corresponding mean collisional time scale .    ) , the collisional times for the inner regions of the secondary disk ( @xmath240au ) are less reliable.,width=336 ]    since the lifetime of dust in the densest parts of the disks is of order @xmath241 to @xmath242 yr , and hence much less than that of the host star ( which is at least 20 myr old ) , our calculations suggest both disks have planetesimals embedded in them capable of replenishing the lost dust . in other words ,",
    "none of the disks represent primordial protoplanetary disks .",
    "rather , they are replenished disk(s ) owing their existence to a substantial mass reservoir , equivalent to a planetary system comparable to our own @xcite .",
    "geometrically , the two disks largely overlap and some regions contain comparable areas of dust .",
    "physically , this implies mutual influence through collisions .",
    "since the optical depths of the disks are much smaller than unity , particles in the two disks can coexist for as many as 20 - 10000 of their orbits .",
    "similarly , the smaller optical depth of the larger parent bodies assures their stability for a large number of orbits in the overlapping disks .",
    "the inferred presence of two disks suggests that @xmath0 pic has two distinct populations of parent bodies ( planetesimals ) in a slightly inclined configuration .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the characterization of the distribution of dust around a star is but a first step toward the derivation of the mass and spatial distribution of larger , unseen bodies ( planetesimals ) , as well as any perturbing planets ; other effects such as dust - dust and any gas - dust interaction in the presence of stellar radiation pressure can spatially displace the fine dust from the place of their origin ( the parent bodies ) . however , some implications of our models are already apparent .",
    "the fact that the secondary disk contains a significant fraction of the dust in the system means that its origin can not be ascribed to a minor event such as a single comet or an asteroid disruption . in order to produce comparable amounts of dust in the two disks",
    ", they must either have a common massive reservoir of parent bodies to draw from or two such reservoirs .",
    "only comprehensive modelling based on high - quality data can clarify the situation since the intermediate - size bodies such as km - sized planetesimals are not amenable to direct detection , possessing neither enough gravitational influence nor large emitting surface area .",
    "the vertical profile we obtained is @xmath243 , with @xmath244 for the first disk and @xmath245 for the second .",
    "thus , neither disk has a vertical scattering profile resembling a disk with a vertical isothermal structure ( @xmath246 , or gaussian vertical profile ) .",
    "the two disks , especially the second one , have super - exponential drop - offs ( @xmath247 ) and therefore extended , slowly diminishing outer wings of the vertical structure , with a sharply pointed inner core .",
    "this could be a sign that the inner core of the profile , referred to as the spine in this paper , is composed of bigger particles than the profile wings ; the mass separation might arise due to energy equipartition leading to a smaller velocity dispersion of the larger particles in the disk .",
    "in addition , a more fanned out secondary debris disk could be a consequence of more energetic collisions of its particles , perhaps indicating their generally smaller sizes and larger radiative modification of orbits .",
    "an expectation based on the the previous dynamical studies of the mobility of dust is that the bulk of a disk or a ring of planetesimals will be located interior to the dust disk .",
    "this follows from the outward action of radiation pressure exerted on dust .",
    "if so , we expect that most planetesimals will be found at a distances less than 50 - 100 au from @xmath0 pic . at such distances",
    ", planetesimals can be perturbed by the proposed 8-jupiter mass planet at a mean distance of 8 au and/or other unknown planetary masses .",
    "perturbing planets , in any case , must be located inside the cross - over radius ( @xmath123 @xmath248 70 au ) of the secondary disk .",
    "we stress here the possibility , indeed necessity , of multiple planets in @xmath0 pic . a planetary system born with only one major planet would tend to stay in alignment with the orbital plane of this planet . in such a case",
    ", we would not expect to see two separate inclined disks . what could be the origin of the inclined orbit of an additional planet ?",
    "although specific inclination pumping mechanisms have yet to be quantified , this may provide a natural explanation to the inclination of planetesimals and dust from the second disk .",
    "this could result in the planet(s ) themselves being on slightly inclined , mutually interacting , orbits thus contributing to the survival of the two inclined disks .",
    "future observations of the inner regions of the disks would be instrumental in establishing the presence of the putative multiple planets via their direct influence on dust . at some point ,",
    "the assumption made in the present work that the disks are intrinsically axisymmetric , if misaligned , must prove inadequate .",
    "with sufficient observational data , our assumption of the same optical properties of dust in two disks may also be relaxed .",
    "furthermore , a future comprehensive model of the system must include not only collisional dust dynamics and radiation , but also the collisional cascades spanning a large size range from planetesimals to micron - sized dust , and possibly more unusual ingredients , such as dust avalanches involving sub - micron dust .",
    "below we summarize the results of this work .    1 .",
    "we modeled the dust distribution around @xmath0 pic with two axisymmetric disks .",
    "a mcmc @xmath1 optimization method was used to reject disk models and phase functions that produce brightness contours different from those obtained with the acs by @xcite .",
    "we find a small quantitative improvement in the reduced @xmath1 ( from 1.8 to 1.2 ) of the two - disk fit compared to the single disk fit ; the two - disk fit , however , displays significant improvements in its ability to trace the isophotes of the composite .",
    "the parameters listed in table [ chromatic ] along with a zodiacal light scattering profile produce the best fits .",
    "dust distribution in the primary disk is largely in agreement with conclusions from previous modeling attempts ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) . the modelled primary disk has a near - zero inclination to the line of sight .",
    "therefore , the up - down asymmetry of the whole disk is not caused by the primary .",
    "the surface density of dust increases as @xmath249-th power of radius inside a cross - over radius @xmath250113 au and decreases at large radii with power - law index @xmath251 ( values from f606w filter fit ) .",
    "this behavior is similar to the one known from previous modelling , although the inner power law is steeper .",
    "the vertical disk profile has a nearly exponentiall fall - off with vertical distance ( @xmath252 ) .",
    "the scattered light contours from the primary disk are shown in figure [ sepdisks ] .",
    "the secondary disk model presents the first quantitative measurement of the dust distribution in this component .",
    "it suggests that the secondary disk , with a scale - height much larger than the primary , is not radially limited to the inner system , but that it extends at least to 250au , and possibly further out .",
    "the secondary disk model has a larger scattering area than the primary at large distances and scale heights , which follows from the less - steep power laws of the radial surface density ( @xmath253 at distances much larger than the cross - over @xmath254 au ) and the vertical density ( @xmath255 ) .",
    "the ratio of the total scattered light ( secondary vs. primary ) is roughly equal to 1.23 . since we do not model the dust size distribution",
    ", we can not compute the dust mass ratio of the two components .",
    "it is however plausible that the secondary disk is as substantial as the primary .",
    "the larger extent and especially the larger scattering area of the secondary disk are surprising and raise many questions about the origin and dynamics of such a pair of disks .",
    "the scattered light contours from the secondary are presented in figure [ sepdisks ] .",
    "4 .   several of the asymmetries reported by @xcite can be reproduced with our model .",
    "the butterfly asymmetry is explained by the presence of an extended secondary disk inclined by @xmath146 to the primary .",
    "we find that it is the secondary that is inclined to the line of sight and therefore responsible for the wing - tilt asymmetry observed in the composite image .",
    "the width asymmetry is present , but not to the degree seen in @xcite data beyond @xmath226 .",
    "the brightness asymmetry is also noticable both across the major and the minor projection axis .",
    "the difference across both the axes is attributed to a secondary disk inclined by @xmath209 to the line of sight and to the primary which is nearly aligned with the major projection axis .",
    "5 .   in order to explore dust dynamics in a pair of disks described by the parameters obtained here ,",
    "we analytically constrain the dust replenishment times to be @xmath3 yr at @xmath2100 au .",
    "such small timescales show that both disks have to be continuously replenished and contain planetesimals that , as eventual mass reservoir , are capable of producing the second - generation dust .",
    "the nature and origin of the inclined disks and planetesimals in @xmath256 pic should be explored via dynamical models of spatially resolved collisional cascades subject to radiation pressure effects .",
    ".   the most plausible conjectural outcome of this modeling is that the non - coplanarity of two dust disks is due to the secondary dust disk being supplied by its own disk of planetesimals , which has been inclined by the gravity of a planet residing inside the cross - over radii ( @xmath257 au ) .",
    "this , in turn , would be most naturally explained if there were more than one massive planets in the system , in orbits inclined by several degrees .",

    "<S> we present 3-d models of dust distribution around @xmath0 pictoris that produce the best fits to the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys ( hst / acs ) images obtained by golimowski and co - workers . </S>",
    "<S> we allow for the presence of either one or two separate axisymmetric dust disks . </S>",
    "<S> the density models are analytical , radial two - power - laws joined smoothly at a cross - over radius with density exponentially decreasing away from the mid - plane of the disks . </S>",
    "<S> two - disk models match the data best , yielding a reduced @xmath1 of @xmath21.2 . </S>",
    "<S> our two - disk model reproduces many of the asymmetries reported in the literature and suggests that it is the secondary ( tilted ) disk which is largely responsible for them . </S>",
    "<S> our model suggests that the secondary disk is not constrained to the inner regions of the system ( extending out to at least 250au ) and that it has a slightly larger total area of dust than the primary , as a result of slower fall - off of density with radius and height . </S>",
    "<S> this surprising result raises many questions about the origin and dynamics of such a pair of disks . </S>",
    "<S> the disks overlap , but can coexist owing to their low optical depths and therefore long mean collision times . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two disks have dust replenishment times on the order of @xmath3 yr at @xmath2100 au , hinting at the presence of planetesimals that are responsible for the production of @xmath4 generation dust . </S>",
    "<S> a plausible conjecture , which needs to be confirmed by physical modeling of the collisional dynamics of bodies in the disks , is that the two observed disks are derived from underlying planetesimal disks ; such disks would be anchored by the gravitational influence of planets located at less than 70 au from @xmath0 pic that are themselves in slightly inclined orbits . </S>"
