    "in addition , @xmath758@xmath759 . to be able to apply minkowski s theorem we need to show that all outer normals to the corresponding parallel facets of @xmath740 and @xmath741 coincide or all are opposite ( in the last case we will consider the facets of @xmath756 and @xmath760 ) .    by lemma [ dual ]",
