    "a static impurity potential has a drastic effect and is renormalized to infinity or zero , depending on whether the interaction is repulsive or attractive.@xcite this anomalous response to a static impurity of tl liquids has attracted a lot of attention and led to further studies on effects of a dynamic impurity ( typically a magnetic impurity ) in a tl liquid . a generalized hubbard model with an impurity spin ( @xmath5 ) and its variants",

    "it was found that the kondo temperature , which is a typical energy scale for host electrons to screen an impurity spin , has a power - law dependence on the kondo exchange coupling.@xcite properties of low - energy fixed points have been discussed using perturbative renormalization group analysis@xcite and the boundary conformal field theory approach.@xcite a recent monte carlo study@xcite on the susceptibility of an impurity spin is consistent with anomalous power - law temperature dependence conjectured earlier.@xcite in addition to the models with a simple kondo coupling , there are some exactly solvable models in which an impurity spin is coupled to the spin density of electrons via special forms of the kondo exchange coupling.@xcite the results obtained for these models using the bethe - ansatz technique , however , do not completely agree with the previous studies,@xcite and this remains as a question to be resolved .    in this paper",
    "we consider a simplified model which we believe shares common features with the above - mentioned kondo effect in 1d interacting electronic models like the hubbard model .",
    "we here focus on the spin sector and discard the charge degree of freedom .",
    "this may correspond to the half - filled case in the original electronic models .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system we discuss in this paper has the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 describes the host @xmath5 xxz spin chain , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the kondo coupling , @xmath10 the size of the impurity spin is also assumed to be 1/2 . an important point of our model is absence of su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry .",
    "we assume @xmath11 to ensure that the host xxz spin chain has gapless excitations . for simplicity",
    "we have used the same parameter @xmath12 in @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "we note that @xmath12 in @xmath7 is an important parameter controlling power - law behavior of various correlations while @xmath12 in @xmath9 does not play any significant role in the following discussions .",
    "the kondo coupling @xmath13 can be either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic , but we will concentrate on the antiferromagnetic case ( @xmath14 ) in this paper .",
    "eggert and affleck@xcite studied , among various kinds of disorder , the model at the isotropic point ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "they concluded that the impurity spin @xmath16 forms a singlet with @xmath17 , and that the heisenberg chain is decoupled into two semi - infinite chains in the low - energy limit .",
    "a leading irrelevant operator at the fixed point was identified and shown to have scaling dimension 2 .",
    "it corresponds to exchange coupling between boundary spins of the two decoupled chains . in this paper",
    "we extend their analysis to the xxz case ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we first bosonize the hamiltonian and study its renormalization group ( rg ) flows in the weak - coupling limit and in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "we will argue that the system is renormalized to stable low - energy fixed points where the impurity spin ( @xmath5 ) is screened exactly . at the fixed points",
    "the boundary condition for the host xxz spin chain depends on the parameter @xmath12 of the host chain : for @xmath3 the spin chain is cut into two semi - infinite chains with open boundary condition at @xmath18 . on the other hand , for @xmath4 the host spin chain is not affected much by the singlet and stays as a single chain .",
    "leading irrelevant operators at these fixed points have noninteger scaling dimensions , yielding noninteger power - law temperature dependence of impurity contribution to specific heat and susceptibility . as evidences for this picture",
    "we will show finite - size scaling of energy gap and spin - spin correlation functions in the ground state , both of which are obtained by using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method .",
    "the numerical results are consistent with the picture drawn from the perturbative rg analysis .",
    "we note that our results are very different from a recent paper by liu,@xcite who studied the same model as ours using mysterious transformations and calculated various quantities near a strong - coupling fixed point .",
    "for example , he obtained superlinear temperature dependence ( @xmath19 : @xmath20 ) for the impurity contribution to the specific heat and vanishing susceptibility at zero temperature , both of which can not be correct from general grounds .",

    "there is a coupling between @xmath17 and its neighbors ( @xmath154 ) .",

    "first we consider @xmath232 , which is equivalent to @xmath230 . since it vanishes when the xxz chain is completely decoupled , the nonzero contribution is due to the leading irrelevant operator @xmath86 . to first order in @xmath96",
    "the correlator is @xmath233 where the averages @xmath234 and @xmath235 are evaluated for the ground state of each decoupled chain . since the scaling dimension of the boundary operators @xmath236 is @xmath84 and that of @xmath237 is @xmath45 , we expect the correlator to scale as @xmath238 from which we get @xmath239 for @xmath213 . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : s - isi_x_d.5 ] are consistent with this perturbative calculation .",

    "the ground state of the whole system is a direct product of @xmath242 , which is the singlet wave function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the ground states of the left and right decoupled spin chains , which we denote @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "we calculate correlation function @xmath245 to lowest order in the coupling between @xmath17 and its neighboring spin , @xmath246 : @xmath247 where @xmath248 is a triplet state of @xmath16 and @xmath17 having excitation energy of order @xmath13 .",

    "we have calculated finite - size gap and spin correlation functions for @xmath254 , where @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "figure [ fig : gap_d-.5 ] shows the finite - size energy gap as a function of the system size for @xmath178 ( mod 4 ) . as in the last section , the gap is defined as difference between the lowest energy in the sector @xmath179 and that in the sector @xmath180 .",
    "we find that the normalized gap @xmath257 increases for small @xmath13 , while it decreases for large @xmath13 .",

    "iia . for large @xmath13 ,",
    "on the other hand , the host xxz chain is almost cut by a singlet , and the finite - size gap roughly corresponds to the singlet - to - triplet excitation energy in half chains . as @xmath55 increases , or equivalently , as the energy scale decreases , the renormalized coupling between the almost decoupled chains becomes larger ( `` healing  ) , leading to the decrease of the normalized finite - size gap .",
    "it is clear that all the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_d-.5 ] approach the dashed line @xmath258 , which is the value one expects for a single xxz chain of length @xmath55 . unlike in the case of @xmath174",

    "the correlator @xmath230 is positive and decays like @xmath262 , while @xmath263 is negative and decays much faster like @xmath264 .",
    "these features are exactly what we expect from our picture of the low - energy fixed point ( figs .",

    "since there is always a short - distance correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath154 , we expect @xmath270 with a smaller constant of proportion for larger @xmath13 .",
    "noting that @xmath271 corresponds to the staggered component in a pure xxz chain without the spin rotation of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , we conclude that @xmath272 and @xmath273 for large @xmath169 .",

    "the impurity spin is screened by a spin in the host chain , and the characteristic energy scale , the kondo temperature @xmath56 , has a power - law dependence on the kondo coupling . from the perturbative rg analysis for various limits , we have deduced properties of strong - coupling , low - energy fixed points . in the antiferromagnetic side ( @xmath3 ) the host xxz chain is cut by the singlet into two separate chains . on the other hand , in the ferromagnetic side ( @xmath4 )",
    "the singlet does not harm the host spin chain in the low - energy limit .",
    "this may be understood qualitatively by mapping the problem to a spinless fermionic system using the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "the fermions have mutual repulsive ( attractive ) interactions in the antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) region .",
    "the singlet may then be viewed as an impurity potential for the fermions , which can be a relevant or irrelevant perturbation , depending on the sign of the mutual interactions . employing the known result for the spinless fermion",
    "system,@xcite we can argue that the host spin chain is cut into two pieces in the antiferromagnetic case whereas in the other case the singlet does not affect the low - energy properties of the spin chain .",
    "we have used the powerful dmrg method to numerically compute finite - size energy gaps and correlation functions .",
    "the numerical results are consistent with the rg analysis . for @xmath174 ,",
