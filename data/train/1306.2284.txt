    "escalation in sequential games is a classic of game theory and it is admitted that escalation is irrational . the rationality which we consider is that given by equilibria .",
    "it has been proved that in finite sequential games , rationality is obtained by a specific equilibrium called _ backward induction _ ( see appendix ) .",
    "more precisely a consequence of aumann s theorem  @xcite says that an agent takes a rational decision in a finite sequential game if she makes her choice according to backward induction . in this paper",
    "we generalize backward induction into _ subgame perfect equilibria _ and we consider naturally that rationality is reached by subgame perfect equilibria ( in short ) relying on capretta s  @xcite extension of aumann s theorem .",
    "[ [ what - is - escalation ] ] what is escalation ?",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in a sequential game , escalation is the possibility that agents take rational decisions forever without stopping .",
    "this phenomenon has been evidenced by shubik  @xcite in a game called the _ dollar auction_. without being very difficult , its analysis is relatively involved , because it requires infinitely many strategy profiles indexed by @xmath1  @xcite . moreover in each step there are two and only two equilibria . by an observation of the past decisions of her opponent an agent could get a clue of her strategy and might this way avoid escalation . this blindness of the agents is perhaps not completely realistic and was criticized ( see  @xcite section  4.2 ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose an example which is much simpler theoretically and which offers infinitely many equilibria at each step .",
    "due to the form of the equilibria , the agent has no clue on which strategy is taken by her opponent .",
    "[ [ escalation - and - infinite - games . ] ] escalation and infinite games .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    books and articles  @xcite which cover escalation take for granted that escalation is irrational . following shubik ,",
    "all accept that escalation takes place and can only take place in an infinite game , but their argument uses a reasoning on finite games . indeed , if one cuts the infinite game in which escalation is supposed to take place at a finite position , one gets a finite game , in which the only right and rational decision is to never start the game , because the only backward induction equilibrium corresponds to not start playing .",
    "then the result is extrapolated by the authors to infinite games by making the size of the game to grow to infinity .",
    "however , it has been known for a long time at least since weierstra  @xcite , that the `` cut and extrapolate '' method is wrong ( see appendix ) . for weierstra this would lead to the conclusion that the infinite sum of differentiable functions would be differentiable whereas he has exhibited a famous counterexample . in the case of infinite structures like infinite games ,",
    "the right reasoning is coinduction .",
    "with coinduction we were able to show that the dollar auction has a rational escalation  @xcite .",
    "currently , since the tools used generally in economics are pre - coinduction based , they conclude that bubbles and crises are impossible and everybody s experience has witnessed the opposite .",
    "careful analysis done by quantitative economists , like for instance bouchaud  @xcite , have shown that bursts , which share much similarities with escalation , actually take place at any time scale .",
    "escalation is therefore an intrinsic feature of economics .",
    "consequently , coinduction is the tool that economists who call for a refoundation of economics @xcite are waiting for  @xcite .",

    "last , we introduce the concept of equilibrium ( sections  [ sec : subg - pertf - equil ] and  [ sec : nash ] ) and we discuss escalation ( section  [ sec : escalation ] ) . in an appendix , we talk about finite games and finite strategy profiles .",
    "our aim is not to present a general theory . for this the reader",
    "is invited to look at  @xcite .",
    "but we want to give a taste of infinite sequential games through a very simple one .",
    "this game has two agents and two choices . to support our claim about the rationality of escalation",
    ", we do not need more features . in  @xcite",
    ", we have shown the existence of a big conceptual gap between finite games and infinite games .",
    "assume that the set @xmath2 of agents is made of two agents called and .",
    "in this framework , an infinite sequential two choice game has two shapes . in the first shape",
    ", it is an ending position in which case it boils down to the distribution of the payoffs to the agents . in other words the game",
    "is reduced to a function @xmath3 and we write it @xmath4 . in the second shape , it is a generic game with a set @xmath5 made of two potential choices : @xmath6 or @xmath7 ( @xmath6 for _ down _ and @xmath7 for _ right)_. since the game is potentially infinite , it may continue forever .",
    "thus formally in this most general configuration a game can be seen as a triple : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an agent and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are themselves games .",
    "the subgame @xmath10 corresponds to the down choice , i.e. , the choice corresponding to go _ down _ and the subgame @xmath11 corresponds to the _ right _ choice , i.e. , the choices corresponding to go to the right . in other words , we define a functor : @xmath12 of which is the final coalgebra and where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .      from a game",
    ", one can deduce _ strategy profiles _ ( later we will also say simply _ profiles _ ) , which is obtained by adding a label , at each node , which is a choice made by the agent .",
    "a choice belong to the set @xmath15 . in other words",
    ", a strategy profile is obtained from a game by adding , at each node , a new label , namely a choice .",
    "therefore a strategy profile which does not correspond to an ending game is a quadruple : @xmath16 where @xmath9 is an agent ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is choice ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) , and , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two strategy profiles . the strategy profile which corresponds to an ending position has no choice , namely it is reduced to a function @xmath22 . from a strategy profile ,",
    "one can build a game by removing the choices : @xmath23 @xmath24 is the underlying game of the strategy profile @xmath25 .",
    "given a strategy profile @xmath25 , one can associate , by induction , a ( partial ) payoff function @xmath26 , as follows : @xmath27 @xmath26 is not defined if its definition runs in an infinite process . for instance",
    ", if @xmath28 is the strategy profile defined in section  [ sec : escalation ] , @xmath29 is not defined . to ensure that we consider only strategy profiles where the payoff function is defined we restrict to strategy profiles that are called _ convergent _ , written @xmath30 ( or sometimes prefixed @xmath31 ) and defined as the least predicate satisfying @xmath32",
    "if @xmath30 , then @xmath26 is defined .    by induction . if @xmath33 , then since @xmath34 and @xmath35 is defined , @xmath26 is defined .    if @xmath36 , there are two cases : @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "let us look at @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath37 , @xmath39 is defined by induction and since @xmath40 , we conclude that @xmath26 is defined .",
    "the case @xmath38 is similar .",
    "as we will consider the payoff function also for subprofiles , we want the payoff function to be defined on subprofiles as well .",
    "therefore we define a property stronger than convergence which we call _ strong convergence_. we say that a strategy profile @xmath25 is _ strongly convergent _ and we write it @xmath41 if it is the largest predicate fulfilling the following conditions .",
    "* @xmath42 if * * @xmath43 is convergent , * * @xmath20 is strongly convergent , * * @xmath21 is strongly convergent .",
    "* @xmath44 is always strongly convergent    more formally : @xmath45    there is however a difference between the definitions of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "wherever @xmath30 is defined _ _ by induction _ _ , from the ending games to the game , @xmath41 is defined _ _ by coinduction__. both concepts are based on the fixed - point theorem established by tarski  @xcite . the definition of @xmath47 is typical of infinite games and means that @xmath47 is invariant along the infinite game . to make the difference clear between the definitions , we use the symbol @xmath48 for inductive definitions and the symbol @xmath49 for coinductive definitions . by the way",
    ", the definition of the function is also coinductive .",
    "we can define the notion of _ subprofile _ , written @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the bisimilarity among profiles defined as the largest binary predicate @xmath53 such that @xmath54 notice that since we work with infinite objects , we may have @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "escalation in a game with a set @xmath2 of agents occurs when there is a tuple of strategies @xmath75 such that its sum is not convergent , in other words , @xmath145 .",

    "@xmath155 and @xmath156 are both rational since they are built using choices , namely  @xmath7 , dictated by subgame perfect equilibria which start with @xmath7 .",
    "another feature of this example is that no agent has a clue for what strategy the other agent is using . indeed after @xmath157 steps , @xmath17 does not know if @xmath18 has used a strategy derived of equilibria in @xmath105 or in @xmath134 . in other words , @xmath17 does know if @xmath18 will stop eventually or not and vice versa .",

    "<S> we study a decision phenomenon called _ escalation_. finite sequential games ( also known as extensive games ) have been introduced by kuhn  @xcite and subgame perfect equilibria have been introduced by selten  @xcite whereas escalation has been introduced by shubik  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sequential games are games in which each player plays one after the other ( or possibly after herself ) . in some specific infinite games , </S>",
    "<S> it has been showed that escalation can not occur among rational players . here </S>",
    "<S> we show on a simple example , the 0,1 game , that this is not the case if one uses coinduction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the 0,1 game has nice properties which make it an excellent paradigm of escalation and a good domain of application for coalgebras and coinduction . </S>"
