    "the creation of vortices and vortex lattices in bose - einstein condensates of cold atomic gases @xcite has opened up the study of vortex lattices in a regime which can not be studied in liquid helium 4 . due to the diluteness of cold atomic gases , it is possible to realize situations in which the vortex core size is comparable to the vortex spacing @xcite .    in a seminal work ,",
    "ho @xcite pointed out that the hamiltonian for a rotating cloud in a harmonic trap has the same form as that for charged particles in a uniform magnetic field . based on the similarity between these two systems , he argued that when the rotation frequency @xmath2 is close to the transverse frequency @xmath1 of the trap , almost all particles would condense into the lowest landau level ( lll ) of the coriolis force .",

    "even the subtle connection between the vortex lattice distortion and the density profile can be described by the simple lll approximation : a small distortion of the vortex results in a drastic change of the density profile from gaussian to the thomas - fermi parabola .",
    "however , limitations of the lll wave function become apparent when we consider excited states .",
    "the oscillations of the cloud radius ( a so - called breathing mode ) in the direction of the rotation axis have been measured in the mean - field lll regime @xcite , and those in the transverse direction are expected to be measured in the future experiments .",
    "however , the lll wave function does not have the flexibility to describe these simple collective modes . in the present work ,",
    "we consider which degrees of freedom in the lll wave function are relevant to describe the breathing mode and provide a simple improved treatment , which remedies the limitations of the lll wave function .    in the beginning of the next section ,",

    "this can be seen also by the following simple argument . in two dimensions , since the angular momentum scales as @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the extent of the cloud in the @xmath104-plane , the rotational kinetic energy scales as @xmath218 .",
