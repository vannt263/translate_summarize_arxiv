    "a rapoport - zink space , introduced in @xcite , is a moduli space of deformations by quasi - isogenies of a fixed @xmath1-divisible group @xmath2 over @xmath3 with various additional structures .",
    "it is a formal scheme @xmath4 locally formally of finite type over the ring of integers @xmath5 of @xmath6 , which is the maximal unramified extension of a finite extension @xmath7 ( called the local reflex field ) of @xmath8 .",
    "rapoport - zink spaces are local analogues of shimura varieties of pel type ( @xcite ) , and are also related to shimura varieties themselves by the theory of @xmath1-adic uniformization ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) ) .",
    "one of the main reasons we are interested in rapoport - zink spaces is the conjectural relation between the @xmath0-adic cohomology of the rapoport - zink tower and the local langlands correspondence .",
    "let us recall it briefly .",
    "we write @xmath9 for the rigid generic fiber of @xmath4 . by using level structures on the universal @xmath1-divisible group over @xmath9",
    ", we can construct a projective system of tale coverings @xmath10 over @xmath9 called the rapoport - zink tower . here",
    "@xmath11 runs through compact open subgroups of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a certain inner form of the reductive algebraic group @xmath14 over @xmath8 that is naturally attached to the linear - algebraic data appearing in the definition of @xmath4 . as in the case of shimura varieties ,",
    "@xmath15 acts on the tower by hecke correspondences . on the other hand ,",
    "the group @xmath16 of self - quasi - isogenies of @xmath2 preserving additional structures naturally acts on @xmath4 , and this action lifts canonically to @xmath17 for each @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the compactly supported @xmath0-adic tale cohomology of the tower @xmath10 .",
    "then , it is naturally equipped with an action of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the weil group of @xmath7 .",
    "roughly speaking , it is expected that the representation @xmath19 of @xmath20 is described by means of the local langlands correspondence for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "there are many results in the classical setting , namely when @xmath4 is either the lubin - tate space or the drinfeld upper half space ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , very little is known in other cases .    in this paper , we will study the underlying reduced scheme @xmath22 .",
    "there already have been a lot of results on @xmath23 in various particular cases ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for example .",
    "in contrast to them , here we try to keep @xmath4 as general as possible .",
    "the main theorem of this paper is as follows .",
    "[ thm : main - intro ] assume that the isogeny class of the @xmath1-divisible group @xmath2 with additional structures comes from an abelian variety ( for the precise definition , see definition [ defn : comes - from - av ] ) .",
    "then , the action of @xmath16 on the set of irreducible components of @xmath23 has finite orbits .    as a consequence of this theorem ,",
    "we can obtain the following finiteness result on the cohomology @xmath19 .",
    "[ cor : coh - finiteness ] assume the same condition as in theorem [ thm : main - intro ] .",
    "then , for every compact open subgroup @xmath11 of @xmath15 , the @xmath11-invariant part @xmath24 of @xmath19 is a finitely generated @xmath16-representation .",
    "this finiteness result is very important when we apply the representation theory ( such as results in @xcite ) to @xmath19 ; see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the author also expects that theorem [ thm : main - intro ] has many other applications than corollary [ cor : coh - finiteness ] .",
    "for example , it plays an important role in the study of the relation between the zelevinsky involution and the cohomology @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the same results as theorem [ thm : main - intro ] and corollary [ cor : coh - finiteness ] have been obtained by fargues ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thorme 2.4.13 , proposition 4.4.13 ) ) under the condition that the data defining @xmath4 is unramified",
    ". however , there are many interesting ramified settings , and usually the geometry of @xmath4 attached to a ramified data is much more complicated than that in the unramified case .",
    "for example , in the unramified case @xmath4 is formally smooth over @xmath5 , while in the ramified case @xmath4 is sometimes not even flat over @xmath5 .",
    "we would like to say a few words on the condition on @xmath2 in theorem [ thm : main - intro ] .",
    "first , the problem to find an abelian variety with additional structures which has the prescribed @xmath1-divisible group up to isogeny can be seen as a generalization of manin s problem , and is studied by many people ( see remark [ rem : manin ] ) . by the results of them ,",
    "it is natural for the author to expect that this condition is always the case .",
    "second , this condition is obviously satisfied if @xmath4 is related to a shimura variety of pel type by the theory of @xmath1-adic uniformization . at present ,",
    "the most successful way to study @xmath19 is relating it with the cohomology of a suitable shimura variety and applying a global automorphic method .",
    "rapoport - zink spaces to which this technique is applicable automatically satisfy our condition .",
    "the author hopes that these two points guarantee the condition in theorem [ thm : main - intro ] to be harmless in practice .    to explain the strategy of our proof of theorem [ thm : main - intro ] , first",
    "let us assume that the isocrystal with additional structures @xmath25 associated with @xmath2 is basic ( @xcite ) . in this case , by the @xmath1-adic uniformization theorem of rapoport - zink (",
    "* theorem 6.30 ) , @xmath4 uniformizes some moduli space of pel type @xmath26 along an open and closed subscheme @xmath27 of the basic stratum @xmath28 of the special fiber @xmath29 . more precisely , there exist finitely many torsion - free discrete cocompact subgroups @xmath30 of @xmath16 such that the formal completion @xmath31 of @xmath26 along @xmath27 is isomorphic to @xmath32 . since @xmath33 is a scheme of finite type over @xmath3",
    ", @xmath27 has only finitely many irreducible components .",
    "hence the number of irreducible components of @xmath34 is also finite , and thus in particular the number of @xmath16-orbits in the set of irreducible components of @xmath23 is finite .",
    "however , if @xmath25 is not basic , the @xmath1-adic uniformization theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.23 ) becomes more complicated ; it involves the formal completion of @xmath26 along a possibly infinite set of closed subschemes of @xmath33 . by this reason",
    ", we can not extend the method above to the non - basic case . to overcome this problem",
    ", we will invoke results by oort @xcite and mantovan @xcite , @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", they say that the newton polygon stratum @xmath28 is almost equal to the product of @xmath23 with the igusa variety .",
    "we will generalize a part of them to the ramified case . combining this generalization with the fact that @xmath28 is of finite type",
    ", we can conclude theorem [ thm : main - intro ] .",
    "the author thinks that this method itself has some importance , because it is a first step to a generalization of mantovan s formula ( the main theorem of @xcite ) to the ramified case .",
    "recall that mantovan s formula is a natural extension of the method in @xcite , and is one of the most powerful tools to investigate the @xmath0-adic cohomology of shimura varieties .",
    "it is also useful to study the cohomology @xmath19 of rapoport - zink towers ( @xcite ) .",
    "we plan to pursue this problem in our future work .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : rz - space ] , we recall the definition of rapoport - zink spaces and explain the precise statement of the main theorem . section [ sec : proof - main - thm ] is devoted to the proof of it . in section [ sec : applications ] , we will give some applications of the main theorem , including corollary [ cor : coh - finiteness ] .",
