    "almost eighty years ago i. i. rabi published two seminal papers @xcite where he solved the quantum dynamics of a semi - classical system consisting of a spin 1/2 immersed in the following time - dependent magnetic field @xmath6 constant in magnitude and precessing around the @xmath7-axis with angular frequency @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fixed unit vectors in the laboratory frame .",
    "it is remarkable and well known that the exact knowledge of the unitary time evolution in such a case provides the basic building block for exactly solving the quantum dynamics of a spin @xmath11 , of arbitrary maximum projection @xmath12 , in the same magnetic field adopted by rabi @xcite .",
    "it is worthy noticing that the group - theoretical based protocol enabling the construction of the evolution operator of the spin @xmath11 from that relative to the spin 1/2 , holds its validity whatever the time - dependent magnetic field is @xcite .",
    "of course , the usefulness of such a protocol depends on our ability to exactly solve the su(2 ) problem of a spin 1/2 acted upon by the assigned time - dependent magnetic field @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of relevance that , quite recently , a new strategy to single out controllable time dependent magnetic fields for which exact analytical solutions of the relative schroedinger - liouville equations for the su(2 ) evolution operator @xmath13 , has been reported @xcite .",
    "in this paper we call an su(2 ) system consisting of a spin @xmath11 in a time - dependent magnetic field , other than that adopted by rabi given in eq . , a generalized rabi system ( grs )",
    ". the scope of this paper is to investigate the mutual dynamical influence between two distinguishable grss coupled by an isotropic heisenberg exchange term .",
    "our motivation is the existence of several physical scenarios of experimental interest wherein a single grs can not be considered as a quantum closed system . in the simplest situation ( that is , ignoring noise )",
    "this grs might be coupled to a second grs so that any appropriate approach to the quantum dynamics of this system calls for a hamiltonian model which takes into account the dynamical variables of both spins .",
    "an isolated dimeric unit of ions , each one exhibiting an effective spin @xmath11 , may be regarded , for example , as a system of two interacting spins .",
    "for some compounds of dimeric units it has been experimentally proven that neglecting the couplings between spins in neighbouring units is legitimate , implying that the quantum dynamics of the same compound may be derived from that of a single dimer @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations on biradical compounds provide a further example of a physical system describable in terms of two interacting spins .",
    "a radical pair , containing two close molecular fragments , each one possessing a spin degree of freedom , may be indeed described by a two coupled spin hamiltonian .",
    "when the two fragments are identical the radical pair is called biradical . in a liquid solution a compound of biradicals , neglecting hyperfine interaction with magnetic nuclei present in the molecular fragments , can be described by a symmetric spin hamiltonian model @xcite .    in the area of quantum computing , finally ,",
    "spin hamiltonian models describing the quantum dynamics of two electron spins in a double quantum dot @xcite or in a double quantum well @xcite , furnish the indispensable theoretical basis to investigate the possibility of manipulating two - electron based qubits .    to achieve realistic descriptions of these spin systems , exploitable for both applicative and fundamental purposes",
    ", one can not however ignore environmental disturbs @xcite .",
    "such uncontrollable contributions to the quantum dynamics of the system may be taken into account as classical fluctuating magnetic fields or , better , as sources of noise , characterized by quantum degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "to control the origin of decoherence in a given spin system is an indispensable issue to be pursued for a full understanding of its dynamical behaviour and for tailoring on demand applicative performances of the same system @xcite .",
    "consider for example a couple of interacting spins hosted in a real or artificial lattice .",
    "the magnetic field acting upon such a spin system results from a controllable , generally time - dependent , contribution and a random one originated by unavoidable hyperfine interactions with the environmental nuclear spin bath around the system under scrutiny .",
    "this fluctuating magnetic field is known as the overhauser field and in this paper will be assumed treatable as a classical random field characterized by statistical properties mimicking the quantum fluctuations of the previously mentioned bath @xcite . postulating that the overhauser field acting upon the spins stems from mechanisms independent of the applied controllable field ,",
    "we show that the results achieved in this paper allow to propose an experimental scheme for checking the classical versus quantum description of the overhauser random field . to this end",
    "we exploit our approach in the case of a landau - zener scenario involving the two coupled spins .",
    "our main results are : a ) the symmetry - based reducibility of the quantum dynamics of our two - spin system to that of a single spin ; b ) the independence of such a reducibility of both the external time - dependent controllable and the fluctuating magnetic field ; c ) the possibility to test the legitimacy of representing the overhauser field as a source of classical noise in a given physical scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the two spin time - dependent hamiltonian model and general features of the generated evolution operator are reported in sec . , while applications leading to some peculiar quantum dynamical results are discussed in sec . .",
    "three exemplary cases are developed in sec . to illustrate our approach while the time behaviour of magnetization and of other physical quantities of experimental interest are presented in the subsequent sec . .",
    "more realistic physical scenarios for our two - spin system are taken into consideration in sec .",
    ", by introducing into the hamiltonian a classical fast gaussian noisy term .",
    "the joint landau - zener transition probabilities are explicitly given .",
    "some conclusive remarks are finally pointed out in the last section .",
    "our physical system consists of two independent , localized and distinguishable spins of different value and physical nature , in general , represented by their relative spin operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . by definition @xmath18=0 $ ] ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 .",

    "we observe that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are parallel ( anti - parallel ) if @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "let us suppose that the two spins are in addition coupled via a ferromagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic isotropic heisenberg interaction of strength @xmath34 , so that the corresponding hamiltonian model may be written down as follows ( from now on we set @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 with @xmath37 acting upon the @xmath38-dimensional hilbert space @xmath39 of the two spins .",
    "it is useful to rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of the total spin angular momentum operator : @xmath40 , getting @xmath41 where @xmath42 is proportional to the identity operator . equation clearly shows that our time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath43 commutes with @xmath44 and this implies that @xmath45 at any time instant .",
    "here @xmath46 , @xmath47 being the unitary time evolution operator fulfilling the cauchy problem @xmath48 and @xmath49 the initial density matrix of the two spins .",
    "the conservation of @xmath50 leads to the existence of @xmath5 ( having assumed @xmath2 ) orthogonal , dynamically invariant subspaces @xmath51 such that @xmath52 @xmath51 denoting the invariant @xmath53-dimensional subspaces of @xmath50 pertaining to its eigenvalue @xmath54 .",
    "the hamiltonian operator may be written as @xmath55 and accordingly generates the time evolution operator , solution of the cauchy problem defined in eq . in the form",

    "since the term @xmath61 is proportional to @xmath60 in @xmath51 , whatever @xmath62 is , the effective hamiltonian @xmath57 governing the dynamics in @xmath51 may be written as @xmath63 which , formally , is the hamiltonian of a fictitious spin @xmath64 , with spin angular momentum @xmath62 and magnetic moment @xmath65 , subjected to the time - dependent magnetic field @xmath66 .",
    "of course , due to eq . and eq . , in this scenario @xmath65 and @xmath66 may be replaced by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "this means that each effective hamiltonian @xmath57 possesses an su(2)-symmetry structure and the related time evolution operator @xmath58 may be expressed @xcite in terms of the two time - dependent complex - valued functions , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , entries of the evolution operator @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "we emphasize that the possibility of expressing @xmath47 in terms of only two time - dependent complex - valued functions may be traced back to the existence of su(2 ) structures nested in the hamiltonian model given by eq . .",
    "such a property is a direct consequence of the symmetries possessed by the hamiltonian model and paves the way to the exact determination of the evolution operator @xmath47 generated by @xmath87 .",

    "it is of relevance , by the way , that recently other su(2 ) time - dependent scenarios have been proposed and exactly solved @xcite .",
    "this circumstance opens the possibility of applying the approach reported in this paper to several possible other scenarios of experimental interest , different from the one originally considered by rabi .",

    "the main scope of this paper is to investigate possible effects of the exchange interaction @xmath91 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the quantum dynamics each spin would experience if @xmath34 were absent .",
    "since the problem of a spin @xmath11 in a time - dependent magnetic field may be considered as a direct generalization of the problem of that treated by rabi in his papers published in 1937 @xcite and 1954 @xcite , we are going to study the reciprocal influence of two generalized semiclassical rabi systems stemming from their exchange coupling .",

    "we emphasize that this effect is related to the increased dimension , from 2 to @xmath105 , of the hilbert subspace where the time evolution takes place and in addition that such a behaviour does not depend on the specific time - dependence of @xmath88 .",

    "in addition we recognize that the class of initial states given by eq .",
    "collects states being interaction free evolving ( ife ) states , recently reported in literature @xcite . by definition",
    "they are pure or mixed states of a binary system evolving in time as if the interaction between the two subsystems were absent .",
    "we point out that , of course , any generic initial condition of the compound system presenting coherence terms between the different dynamically invariant subspaces of @xmath87 and @xmath4 does not manifest such a peculiar dynamical feature since the reduced dynamics of the two spins is influenced by the existing isotropic heisenberg coupling between the two spins .",
    "it is finally worthwhile to observe that the initial entanglement between the two spins @xmath0 and @xmath1 in an arbitrary state of the class singled out by eq . ,",
    "does not change in time , whatever the entanglement measure adopted is . the physical reason may be traced back to the dynamical quenching of the interaction term stemming , in turn , from constraints on the evolution imposed by the symmetry properties possessed by our hamiltonian model .",
    "in this section we apply our general procedure explained in the first section to three exemplary cases : @xmath136 ; @xmath139 ; @xmath138 . in the first case",
    "we retrace the general procedure explained in the first section , while for two last cases we give only the final interesting result .",

    "noteworthy differences in the quantum dynamics of the two - spin system however emerge as a direct consequence of the noisy source .    to appreciate this point ,",
    "consider , for instance , the time evolution of the initial factorized state @xmath102 . in the previous sections we have demonstrated that , when the fluctuating field is absent , this state has an ife nature , so that the probability @xmath98 of finding the two spins in @xmath103 at a generic time instant is nicely expressible as product of the relevant probabilities , @xmath230 and @xmath231 governing the transition paths of the two spins .",
    "such a property , still true for any specific realization of the fluctuating field , is lost when we average over all the possible realizations of this field . in other words , in presence of a random magnetic field @xmath232 , since now all these three involved probabilities result from the resolution of the relevant dynamical equations and from the average processes .",

    "these three probabilities are notationally of the form : @xmath251 expressing the probability that the compound system evolves from the initial state @xmath252 to the final state @xmath253 of the two - spin system . for example @xmath254 denotes the transition probability from the state @xmath255 to the state @xmath256 defined in eq . .",

    "2 as a function of @xmath262 treating @xmath217 as a parameter and _ vice versa _ in fig .",
    "both plots show that at very big noise the joint lz transition probability becomes more and more insensitive to the external applied transverse magnetic field sharing its value 1/3 with the other two populations @xmath254 and @xmath263 .",
    "moreover , from the previous plots we understand that the effect of the noise is different depending on the value of the controllable applied magnetic field .",
    "indeed , it is possible to verify that for @xmath264 @xmath261 is always favoured by the random magnetic field , while for @xmath265 @xmath261 is always countered by the noisy field . in the @xmath262-interval @xmath266 we instead have two ranges of values of @xmath217 in which the random field acts first favouring and then hindering the transition as it can be seen by fig .",
    "it is interesting to underline that in this physical scenario , the average magnetization of the two - spin 1/2 system at @xmath247 , @xmath267 , with @xmath193 , results @xmath268.\\ ] ] we see that , as expected , the magnetization of the two - spin 1/2 system vanishes in the standard white noise case ( @xmath269 ) , in accordance with the fact that , in this limit condition , in view of eqs . and , the populations of the two states @xmath270 and @xmath271 at @xmath247 coincide .",
    "the structure of @xmath272 factorized into a function of @xmath217 only and a function of @xmath262 only means that the contributions of the noise and of the transverse controllable magnetic field act independently as a consequence of the assumed fast noise scenario @xcite . in fig .",
    "5 we plot @xmath272 as function of @xmath262 for different values of @xmath217 .    for the sake of completeness we report also the transition probabilities when the two - spin 1/2 system is prepared in @xmath271 and @xmath256 , having respectively @xmath273 and @xmath274 , \\\\ & & p_{\\psi^+}^{\\psi^+}=2p_{\\psi^+}^{\\pm\\mp}= \\\\ \\nonumber & & = { 1 \\over 3}\\bigl[1 - 2e^{-3\\theta/2}(6e^{-2\\pi\\gamma}-6e^{-4\\pi\\gamma}-1)\\bigr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our analysis may be repeated for the other scenarios concerning both the noise and the transverse field , exploiting refs .",
    "we do not proceed further , our goal being to show how the common symmetries of the hamiltonian models and are enough to reduce the quantum dynamics of a system of two interacting spins to the quantum dynamics of a single spin both in absence and in presence of noise .",
    "in this paper we have brought to light that the quantum dynamics of a binary system constituted by two , generalized or not , rabi systems under a @xmath4-conserving bilinear coupling is reducible to that of non - interacting fictitious spins .",
    "such property , being based on the structural symmetry imposed to the hamiltonian model , is immune from effects stemming from degradation of unitary evolution due to the presence of classical random fields and moreover holds whatever the time - dependence of the controllable magnetic field is .",
    "we thus claim that this reducibility property , applicable to two quantum spins @xmath0 and @xmath1 of arbitrary maximum projections @xmath106 and @xmath107 , represents a new rather general result exploitable in several different physical contexts from condensed matter to quantum information , briefly discussed in the introduction .",
    "our paper indeed provides ready - for use su(2)-based expressions of the unitary time evolution operator in terms of the two time - dependent complex - valued functions entering in the evaluation of the joint probability transition of the two spins from an initial state to a final state , in absence of noise .",
    "it is remarkable that under appropriate initial conditions the reduced dynamics of each spin , when noise is ignored , keeps unitarity , meaning that the initial state of the compound system behaves indeed as an ife state .",
    "the usefulness of our general approach and our results , in absence of noise , have been illustrated for three exemplary cases : two interacting qubits , two interacting qutrits and a qubit interacting with a qutrit .",
    "the time behaviour of the total magnetization as well as of each individual spin ( supposed distinguishable ) has been exactly forecasted .",
    "it deserves to be emphasized that , in principle and still with no noise , measurements of such time - dependences allow to achieve a feedback both on the coupling mechanism and , if confirmed as heisenberg exchange interaction , on the coupling constant strength .",
    "it is worth noting that , once again under ideal conditions , the level of entanglement established between two spin 1/2 s described by our model is independent of any detail of the time - dependent magnetic field applied .",
    "the dynamical richness of the adopted hamiltonian model thus suggests to investigate on effects stemming from noise .",
    "we have undertaken this task in the last part of our paper . to this end",
    "we have added to the ideal hamiltonian model a fast gaussian overhauser field selected as a classical field , random both in its direction and intensity .",
    "taking advantage of the results reached in this paper concerning the unitary dynamics , we explicitly determine in the special case of two spin 1/2 s , for simplicity , the joint probability of the lz transition @xmath261 , after pointing out that it can not be factorized as in the ideal case .",
    "our results clearly show that the effects of the fluctuating field on @xmath261 might increase or decrease the same quantity we should have in ideal conditions in accordance with the value of the transverse controllable field applied on the spin in addition to the lz longitudinal linear ramp .",
    "a remarkable consequence of this exact theory of the quantum dynamics of our lz system under scrutiny is that , in case of departure between our theoretical predictions and experimental results related to a given set - up , one possible implication could be the inadequacy of the way the overhauser field is represented in the hamiltonian model . in this last case one",
    "might be induced to a drastic change of the nature of the noise ( for example from classical to quantum one ) or of the constraint used to specify the random field itself .    as last remarks , we point out first that it is straightforward to make use of the approach reported in this paper to treat successfully the quantum dynamics of the hamiltonian model given in eq . when the coupling constant @xmath34 is considered time - dependent too .",
    "physical scenarios and experimental set - ups leading to time - dependent coupling constants between two subsystems have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "secondly , we notice that our approach does not loose its interest even when the experimental set - up in conjunction with the physical system under scrutiny prevent us from invoking distinguishability of two equal and interacting spins . in this case",
    "our approach still holds its validity provided we confine ourselves to any permutationally ( symmetric or antisymmetric ) invariant subspace @xmath51 of the hilbert space spanned by the eigenstates of the total angular momentum .",
