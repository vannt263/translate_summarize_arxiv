    "<S> the analysis in this section could be replaced by that of @xcite , which avoids separating variables ; the advantage of our approach is that it gives an estimate in a logarithmically large neighborhood of the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> although we do not exploit this here , as mentioned above this improvement can probably be used to show that a larger resonance free region exists , at least when @xmath3 is a surface of revolution .    in  [ </S>",
    "<S> s : applications ] we apply to local smoothing and resonant wave expansions . for the latter we need the additional assumption , satisfied in the example above and in many of the examples in  [ s : examples ] , that @xmath15 is meromorphic in @xmath18 . in  [ s : low ] we prove using bessel function asymptotics .    </S>",
