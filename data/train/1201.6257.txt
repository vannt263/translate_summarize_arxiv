    "game theory has proved useful in a number of settings in biology , economy , and social science in general . evolutionary game theory in particular",
    "is well suited to the study of strategic interactions in animal and human populations and has been a very useful mathematical tool for dealing with these kind of situations .",
    "evolutionary games have been traditionally studied in the context of well - mixed and very large populations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . however , starting with the work of nowak and may  @xcite , and especially in the last few years , population structures with local interactions have been brought to the focus of research .",
    "indeed , it is a fact of life that social interactions can be more precisely represented as networks of contacts in which nodes represent agents and links stand for their relationships  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding literature has already grown to a point that makes it difficult to be exhaustive ; however , good recent reviews can be found in  @xcite .",
    "most of the new results , owing to the difficulty of analytically solving non mean - field models , come from numerical simulations , but there are also some theoretical results , mainly on degree - homogeneous graphs . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the work so far has dealt with unweighted graphs .",
    "this is understandable as a logical first step , since attributing reliable weights to relationships in social networks is not a simple matter because the relationship is often multi - faceted and implies psychological and sociological features that are difficult to define and measure , such as friendship , empathy , and common beliefs . in spite of these difficulties ,",
    "including the strength of agents ties would be a step toward more realistic models .",
    "in fact , sometimes at least a proxy for the intensity of a relationship can be defined and accurately measured .",
    "this is the case for e - mail networks , phone calls networks , and coauthorship networks among others .",
    "for example , in an extensive study of mobile phone calls network  @xcite , the authors used the number of calls between two given agents and the calls duration to capture at least part of the underlying more complex social interaction .",
    "the same can be done in coauthorship networks in which the strength of a tie can be related to the number of common papers written by the two authors  @xcite .",
    ", @xmath0 in barabsi  albert networks .",
    "the weight - degree correlation is @xmath1 and the strategy update rule is replicator dynamics .",
    "each point is the average of @xmath2 independent runs ; continuous curves are just a guide for the eye .",
    "small lines on the right and left borders indicate the cooperation level for @xmath3.,width=264 ]    little work has been done on evolutionary games on weighted networks to date .",
    "two recent contributions are  @xcite .",
    "we have recently offered a rather systematic analysis of standard evolutionary games on several network types using some common weight distributions with no correlations with the underlying network topology features such as node degree and local clustering  @xcite .",
    "the results in all cases studied in  @xcite are that the evolutionary game dynamics are little affected by the presence of weights , that is , the graph topology , together with the game class and the strategy update rules seem to be the main factors dictating strategy evolution in the population . this is a reassuring result to the extent to which it allows us to almost ignore the weights and focus on the structural aspect only .",
    "however , the previous results , as said above , were obtained with standard weight distribution functions and ignoring possible correlations with other topological features .",
    "thus , it is still possible that some particular weight assignment that takes these factors into account could make the dynamics to behave in a more radically different way . indeed , in  @xcite , du et al .",
    "have investigated the prisoner s dilemma on barabsi  albert scale - free graphs with a particular form of two - body correlation between the link weights and the degrees of the link endpoints , finding an increase of cooperation under some conditions with respect to the unweighted case .",
    "we shall discuss and extend their results in sect .",
    "[ deg - weight - corr ] . in the present paper",
    "we have studied another form of degree - weight correlation that is more likely to occur in social networks and gives unprecedented amounts of cooperation promotion on scale - free networks . in the following we first give a brief description of the games used and of the population dynamics ; then we present and discuss our results .",
    "we investigate four classical two - person , two - strategy , symmetric games , namely the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) , the hawk - dove game ( hd ) , the stag hunt ( st ) , and the harmony game ( h ) .",
    "we briefly summarize the main features of these games here for completeness ; more detailed accounts can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",

    "players have a strong incentive to play @xmath7 , which is harmful for both parties if the outcome produced happens to be @xmath18 . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are ne of the game in pure strategies .",

    "the first model is a rather raw but revealing way of extracting an unweighted structure from the weighted graph by filtering out edges with low enough weights .",
    "the resulting topology should be of help in understanding the origins of the large promotion of cooperation we found on our particular class of weighted correlated networks . starting with a ba graph , we set the weights according to the form @xmath94 , discard the edges with a weight inferior to a threshold @xmath104 , and finally set all weights of the remaining links to one .",

    "[ beta1 ] is fully maintained apart from some small differences due to the details of the dynamics and slightly different network sizes .",

    "@xcite find that when a network becomes assortative by degree , the large - degree vertices tend to interconnect to each other closely , which destroys the sustainability among cooperators and promotes the invasion of defectors , whereas in disassortative networks , the isolation among hubs protects the cooperative hubs in holding onto their initial strategies to avoid extinction .",
    "this study , although it is different from ours since it does not start from weighted networks , also shows the role of degree disassortativity in influencing cooperation .",

    "in their view , the hubs drive the population , fully or partially , to cooperation in hd games .",
    "the reason is the following : the hubs get more payoff , thus a defector hub triggers the change of his neighbors to defection , while a cooperator hub triggers it to cooperation , favoring cooperation since cooperative hubs surrounded by cooperators get a higher payoff . in our weighted case",
    "the topology of the network leads to cooperation not only in the hd game , but also in the pd game . in this case",
    "the idea of hubs driving the population to cooperation is very relevant , because the new topology amplifies this effect .    according to eq .",

    "these data have been obtained by numerically simulating the games evolution on the graph of fig .",
    "[ bipartit1 ] with replicator dynamics and varying the number of common neighbors from @xmath88 to @xmath121 .",
    "the upper row of fig .  [ bipartit2 ] shows the games phase space with or without an edge between the two hubs for the graph of fig .",
    "[ bipartit1 ] starting from a random initial distribution , while the lower row of fig .",
    "[ bipartit2 ] shows the same plots with the following initial distribution : a is cooperator , b is defector , random strategies are assigned to the other vertices .",
    "the plots show that the model in which the hubs are connected induces more cooperation in all games . when hubs are not connected ( the left images )",
    "results are very similar in the upper and lower images because propagation via the hubs is no longer possible .",
    "now , we shall try to explain the mechanism at work referring to the graph in fig .",
    "[ bipartit1 ] .",
    "if node a is a cooperator and node b is a defector , by roca s et al .",
    "arguments  @xcite , a will have an advantage and could spread cooperation to b. however , if a and b are not directly connected , strategy migration will have to go through a low degree node and this will make further progress more difficult because b is a hub and is likely to collect a higher payoff . on the other hand , when there is a link between a and b , b could imitate cooperator a at some point . to spread cooperation",
    "further now cooperator b needs cooperator neighbors in order to get a sufficiently high payoff .",
    "b could obtain this from common neighbors with a , which are more likely to be cooperators than the neighbors that are only connected to it and not to a. therefore , having a direct connection between a and b is crucial for the dynamics to lead to high degrees of cooperation .",
    "this can be seen in the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ bipartit2 ] for the case in which a has a link to b ( right part ) and to the opposite case ( left part ) .",
    "a certain number of shared neighbors between a and b seems to play an important role . without them",
    ", there would be segregation of strategies , reflected in the average cooperation level in fig .",
    "[ bipartit1 ] ( left ) for @xmath88 or a low number of common neighbors for the hd and the pd . as this number increases ,",
    "however , cooperation may propagate from hub to hub .",
    "when the number of common neighbors becomes too high , around @xmath122 , a cooperator hub is no longer favored as now his cooperator and defector neighbors will be about the same number .",
    "it is worth noting that perc et al .",
    "@xcite with an apparently unrelated grid population model in which a fraction of players is more influential in the sense that they can transmit their strategy to others more easily , also obtain a high amount of cooperation in the weak pd game .",
    "for this to happen , it is also needed that , with a small probability a player can randomly link temporarily to distant sites in the lattice .",
    "when both features are present cooperation is boosted .",
    "although weighted networks are closer to reality , evolutionary games on complex networks have been essentially studied on unweighted networks until now , both for simplicity as well as because weights in social networks are notoriously difficult to assess . in this article we introduced a new degree - weight correlation form in a model derived from three standard unweighted networks classes : ba graphs , the configuration model , and erds - rnyi random graphs .",
    "we studied the evolutionary game dynamics of standard two - person , two - strategies games on these classes of networks for which accurate results exist in the unweighted cases .",
    "a weight - degree correlation of the form @xmath123 had already been studied  @xcite , giving a small gain in cooperation for a restricted range of @xmath74 on ba networks .",
    "however , it has empirically been found that real social weights are not correlated to @xmath124  @xcite .",
    "thus in this work we used the perpendicular coordinate @xmath83 in the weight - degree correlation @xmath94 to study the proportion of cooperators at steady state on static weighted networks , and varying the weights from a more assortative case to a more disassortative case passing through the unweighted case .",
    "as @xmath74 increases toward disassortative weights , cooperation dramatically increases until a maximum of @xmath125 averaged in the whole pd game phase space . and",
    "results are equally good for the hd and st games , both for the replicator dynamics as well as for the fermi rule .",
    "a small value of @xmath85 such as @xmath79 or one is sufficient to induce unprecedented amounts of cooperation , and this remains true also for the linear correlation form @xmath126 .",
    "the outcome at steady state depends on the initial conditions : starting from lower cooperation fractions induce less cooperation at steady state , which is also the case in the unweighted networks  @xcite .",
    "the best results were obtained for ba networks or random scale - free graphs , but even with erdos - rnyi random graphs , which are known to induce little or no cooperation in the unweighted case  @xcite , results are better , especially for the pd in which the amount of cooperation is comparable with the corresponding result for an unweighted ba graph . on the other hand , the assortative weights ( @xmath95 ) are in general slightly detrimental to cooperation , except for the pd game where the increase is small anyway . summing up , we can say that the main result in this part is that payoff - proportional imitation induces cooperation in a large part of the prisoner s dilemma with the given weights and @xmath127 on heterogeneous networks .",
    "the other games are positively affected as well .    in the second part of the present work we provided qualitative arguments for the emergence of large increases of cooperation in unweighted networks derived from the weighted ones . to this end",
    ", we proposed to filter out edges with low weight in the original network and to set all the remaining weights to 1 . the cooperation level in those unweighted graphs ,",
    "after removing isolated vertices , is similar or even higher than in the weighted networks .",
    "the features observed are : a bipolar distribution of degree ( low degree and high degree vertices ) , degree disassortativity , low degree vertices are connected only to hubs while some connections between hubs may still exist for moderate @xmath74 , thus a nearly bipartite graph .",
    "then , keeping only the necessary features , we constructed a small network which helps to intuitively understand the origins of the large increase in cooperation .",
    "we found that while low degree vertices surrounding hubs advantage cooperators , common neighbors between hubs and direct links between hubs are important for the propagation of cooperation in the network .    a general consideration on the results we obtained is the following .",
    "we do not know whether the weighted networks , or the unweighted ones derived from them do really exist , at least in an approximate form .",
    "ours is only an abstract model and weighted network data to perform empirical analyses are difficult to find . nevertheless ,",
    "in the future it would be interesting to study empirical degree - weight correlations in real - life network .",
    "if correlations of the type assumed in this work with @xmath127 could be found , then the corresponding networks would likely be favorable for cooperation in evolutionary games .",
    "also , considering dynamical network evolution linked to a game  @xcite , cooperative network similar to ours could emerge at steady state , because they maximize the number of satisfied players .",
    "nevertheless , naturally occurring social networks do have a large amount of clustering , which is not the case in our filtered unweighted networks , but could be obtained on the weighted ones .",
    "finally , the highly hierarchical cooperative unweighted structures found in this work could be created on purpose , if cooperation is the objective .",
    "this could be especially useful when the network nodes are not only persons but also organizations or institutions that happen to interact according to game rules similar to those used in the simulations .",
    "we thank our colleague alberto antonioni for carefully reading the manuscript and for his insightful suggestions .",
    "we also thank the anonymous reviewers for their useful and constructive comments ."
