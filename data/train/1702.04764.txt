    "when dealing with real world problems with high degrees of complexity , scientists often observe that unknown target functions are imprecise and elusive , and that data acquired on them do not always reflect their true nature .",
    "this can be caused by a host of known and unknown reasons .",
    "to name just a few , one may encounter reading and interpreting errors , lost in translation , instrument failures or malfunctions . in the literature , this is often referred to as the  noisy data \" phenomenon ( @xcite ) . under these circumstances , models established by computationally - expensive algorithms often do not survive the test of cross validation and sometimes fail outright to reflect reality in ways they are designed for .",
    "long and hard work devoted to the establishment of the models is quickly rendered worthless . to make meaningful decisions",
    ", one needs to use the best available data to build multiple models and test them against newly acquired data .",
    "the process is often repeated numerous times , as the so called  best available data \" and model selection criteria may also subject to uncertainty of various degrees .",
    "the challenging computing environment has ruled out the employability of most of the interpolation methods and many of the quasi - interpolation methods .",
    "an interpolation procedure entails solving a large linear system , which is often expensive and slow .",
    "in addition , interpolating ",
    "noisy data \" is like playing a meaningless hide - and - seek game during which one seldom knows the boundary between  over - fitting \" and  under - fitting \" .",
    "many quasi - interpolation schemes rely on elaborated mathematical procedures to find the values of the parameters , which is unpractical in reality .",
    "shepard @xcite proposed in @xmath0 the following approximation scheme .",
    "suppose function values @xmath1 are available at the scattered sites @xmath2 in a domain @xmath3 .",
    "then a function of the form : @xmath4^{-1 } \\sum^n_{j=1}f(x_j)\\ \\phi(|x - x_j|),\\ ] ] is constructed to approximate the target function @xmath5 in @xmath3 .",
    "here @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , in which @xmath8 denotes the euclidean norm of @xmath9 .",
    "this procedure has since become known as  shepard approximation \" , and variations of it",
    "have been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein .    in a nutshell ,",
    "a shepard approximation scheme employs rational formations of shifts of an appropriately - selected base function to approximate a target function , and its efficiency epitomizes in the reproduction of constants . because of the singularity of the base function at zero , the original shepard approximant interpolates values of the target function at @xmath10 .",
    "that is , @xmath11 .",
    "however , for most other choices of base functions , the interpolation feature is lost , and the resulted approximants are called  quasi - interpolants \" in the literature ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "except for the cases in which the base function is compactly supported ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , deriving optimal order error estimates for a shepard approximation scheme has been uncommon . in this paper , we study a new variation of shepard approximation by introducing a dilation factor into the base function , which synchronizes with the hausdorff distance between the data set and the domain .",
    "the novelty enables us to establish an optimal order jackson @xcite type error estimate ( with an explicit constant ) for bounded continuous functions .",
    "the proof requires decomposing the domain as the union of concentric thin annuli with no common interior .",
    "this is a standard technique in many branches of analysis .",
    "notably , the technique has recently been applied by authors of @xcite and @xcite in bounding the @xmath12-norms of interpolation operators and the least square operators associated with radial basis functions .",
    "the following question arises naturally : how many well - separated points can be put inside a specified annulus ?",
    "for the special case in which the annuli have thickness @xmath13 and inner radius @xmath14 , where @xmath13 is the separation radius of the data set , narcowich and ward @xcite gave the upper bound estimate : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the dimension of the ambient space .",
    "in our situation , however , the annuli have thickness precisely the hausdorff distance between the data set and the domain , which is usually larger than the separation radius of the data set . adapting their method in this setting",
    "has resulted in an unexpected large constant that has a fast - growing exponential rate with respect to the dimension . in order to refine this",
    ", we employ the gauss hypergeometric functions , and engage in a more labor - intensive procedure to obtain a tighter estimate ( proposition [ lemma ] ) .",
    "we also derive a new upper bound estimate for the above special case ( corollary [ nw ] ) .",
    "besides their utility in this paper to obtain optimal order jackson type error estimate , these upper bound estimates provide information on the minimal densities of packing spheres or spherical wedges in annuli of @xmath17dimensional space . therefore",
    ", their asymptotic behaviors with respect to both @xmath18 and @xmath16 need to be closely watched .",
    "the results of proposition [ lemma ] and corollary [ nw ] show that in packing spheres or spherical wedges in annuli , both the size of the spheres ( or spherical wedges ) and that of the annuli are sensitive matters .",
    "this is in contrast to density results from conventional sphere packings in euclidean spaces ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "details of the above discussion will be given in section 2 .",
    "the main result of the paper ( jackson type error estimate ) and its proof will be given in section 3 .",
    "a focus of the current paper is to provide an readily - implementable and yet efficient approximation method . as such",
    ", we write the paper in a style catering to the needs of practitioners in the field . among other efforts devoted to obtain the results ,",
    "we derive all the constants explicitly in closed forms .",
    "to be savvy with using notations , we adopt the notations : ( i ) @xmath19 for the absolute value of a real number @xmath20 ; ( ii ) @xmath21 for the cardinality of a finite set @xmath22 ; ( iii ) @xmath23 the euclidean distance between @xmath24 ; and ( iv ) @xmath25 for the lebesgue measure of a bounded lebesgue - measurable set @xmath26 .",

    "we will use @xmath33 to denote half of the above infimum .",
    "let @xmath34 be the hausdorff distance ( @xcite ) between the two sets @xmath32 and @xmath3 .",
    "that is @xmath35 if @xmath32 is well - separated , and if in addition there is a constant , @xmath36 , independent of @xmath30 , such that @xmath37 then we say that @xmath32 is quasi - uniformly distributed in @xmath3 . in the literature",

    ", we will reserve the two constants @xmath41 exclusively for the purposes as dictated in and .",

    "if @xmath3 is bounded , then a quasi - uniformly distributed set @xmath46 is necessarily finite . in this case",
    ", the quasi - uniformity can be equivalently defined as follows .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath47 , depending only on @xmath16 , such that @xmath48 the above inequality is equivalent to that there are two constants @xmath49 , depending only on @xmath16 , such that @xmath50    we are interested in finding an upper bound for the number @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is an annulus of outer radius @xmath53 and thickness @xmath54 . our basic approach in answering the above question is to use the pigeonhole principle .",

    "notice that , as points from @xmath32 are @xmath60-separated , the intersection @xmath61 has empty interior .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to get an upper bound on the number of points in the annulus , @xmath62 , by packing spheres @xcite of radius @xmath63 in @xmath62 .",
    "we would proceed by using the pigeonhole principle to get : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a ball in @xmath66 of radius @xmath63",
    ". however , independent of @xmath29 , it is possible for points of @xmath32 to lie on or close to the boundary of @xmath62 .",
    "these points do not enjoy a full measurement of volumes of their associated balls contributing to the calculation above based on the pigeonhole principle .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ ideal ] .    to correct the estimate in",
