    "investigations of the evolution of the quasar population have played a major role in the development of our ideas about the nature of these sources and their connection to other extragalactic objects .",
    "ever since the first complete survey of 3c radio quasars by schmidt ( 1968 ) and the subsequent survey of 4c quasars by lynds and wills ( 1972 ) it has been evident that the population of quasars as a whole has undergone rapid evolution . using the so - called @xmath11 method these authors interpreted the evolution with redshift @xmath12 as caused by an increase in the co - moving density of quasars with redshift .",
    "however , both the source counts ( giaconni et al .",
    "1979 , tananbaum et al . 1979 ) and the redshift distribution of optically selected samples of quasars ( see e.g. marshall 1985 ) clearly showed that such pure density evolution ( pde ) models , for which the luminosity function is separable as [ eq : pde ] ( l , z ) = ( l ) ( z ) , can not be correct . as more data was accumulated the pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model , with ( l , z ) = ( l / g(z ) ) / g(z ) , gained more popularity .",
    "the function @xmath13 describes the luminosity evolution of the population and @xmath14 is the luminosity adjusted to its present epoch ( @xmath15 ) value .",
    "this model , while providing a better fit to the data than that of pure density evolution , also appears to be inadequate in many cases ( see e.g. petrosian 1973 , schmidt and green 1978 , koo and kron 1988 , caditz and petrosian 1990 ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "we can write the luminosity function as [ eq : gle ] ( l , z ) = ( z ) ( l / g(z),_i ) / g(z ) . with @xmath16 normalized such that @xmath17 , @xmath18 gives the density and its evolution and @xmath19 describes the local luminosity function ( with @xmath20 ) .",
    "here we explicitly include the @xmath21 , parameters such as spectral index and break luminosity that describe the shape of the luminosity function . in general , these parameters may vary with redshift .",
    "a surprising , and a priori unexpected , result has been the absence of evidence for strong shape variation .",
    "such results imply that the density and luminosity functions @xmath18 and @xmath13 describe the _ physical evolution _ of sources ; e.g. the rate of birth and death of sources and the changes in source luminosity with time .",
    "cavaliere and colleagues ( see cavaliere and padovani 1988 and references cited therein ) were the first to emphasize this fact .",
    "a more complete description of the relation between the physical evolution and the functions describing the generalized luminosity function ( or statistical evolution ) can be found in caditz and petrosian ( 1990 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this relation is not unique , thus any test of quasar models via their expected evolution with cosmic epoch must usually involve additional assumptions .",
    "for example , quasars could be long lived ( compared to the hubble time ) sources created during a relatively short period at high redshift undergoing continuous luminosity evolution .",
    "this is the model used in caditz , petrosian and wandel ( 1991 ) .",
    "alternatively , quasars could be short lived phenomena with birth rate , death rate and luminosity that vary systematically with redshift ( see siemiginowska and elvis 1997 ) .",
    "most of the work along these lines assumes what is now the standard model for the source of energy of quasars and other active galactic nuclei ( or agns ) ; namely , accretion onto a massive black hole .",
    "another interesting aspect of quasar evolution is the relation between the evolution of the luminosity density of quasars , @xmath22 , and similar functions describing the evolution of galaxies , such as the star formation rate ( sfr ) . as shown by the high redshift surveys of schmidt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and others ( e.g. warren et al .",
    "1994 ) , the rapid rise with redshift of the luminosity of quasars stops around redshift @xmath23 or @xmath24 and is expected to drop , perhaps mimicking the sfr ( see shaver et al .",
    "1998 , cavaliere and vitorini 1998 , and hawkins and vron 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "we determine the luminosity function and its evolution for combined samples of quasars from various surveys , described in @xmath25 . for",
    "a complete review of the various ways of accomplishing this task , see petrosian ( 1992 ) .",
    "we use here non - parametric methods based on lynden - bell s ( 1971 ) idea which was generalized by efron and petrosian ( 1992 ) to allow not only a determination of the functional forms but also a test of correlation between redshifts and luminosities .",
    "this is essential for any determination of the functional form of the luminosity evolution @xmath13 .",
    "the above papers deal with magnitude limited samples with only an upper magnitude ( lower flux ) limit .",
    "however , because of observational constraints , some of the samples are truncated in redshift space and some have an upper magnitude ( lower flux ) limit .",
    "the methods described in the above papers can not be used for such multiply truncated data .",
    "new methods for treating this type of data were developed by efron and petrosian ( 1998 ) .",
    "in @xmath26 we describe these new techniques and their relation to the older methods .",
    "the choice of cosmological model also plays a crucial role in such determinations .",
    "it is well known that one can not determine both the evolution of the luminosity function and the parameters of the cosmological model from magnitude limited samples alone .",
    "only by assuming values for the cosmological parameters such as matter density , curvature and cosmological constant can one calculate the form of @xmath8 .",
    "alternatively , with some assumptions about @xmath8 one can test various cosmological models .",
    "in @xmath27 we describe the cosmological model parameters and in @xmath28 we present the results of applications of the new statistical methods to the data described in @xmath25 .",
    "finally , in @xmath29 we summarize these results and present our conclusions .",
    "there have been many surveys of quasars , ranging from the original radio selected samples of the 3c ( schmidt 1963 ) and 4c ( lynds and wills 1972 ) surveys to a variety of other optically and x - ray selected samples . in this paper",
    ", we will focus only on optically selected data .",
    "we use data from four samples with relatively similar selection criteria that provide a somewhat homogeneous data set spanning a large area of the @xmath30 plane . in order to combine the samples ,",
    "all magnitudes were transformed to the @xmath31 band .",
    "some of the samples were artificially truncated in order to insure completeness within the truncation limits . the combined sample consisted of 1552 objects in the range @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with well defined upper and lower magnitude limits for each object .",
    "figure @xmath34 shows the distribution of the complete surveys in the @xmath35 plane , which at first sight shows little evidence for a hubble relation of @xmath36 .",
    "however , as we shall discuss below , there is evidence for cosmological dimming with redshift of the sources .",
    "the large bright qso survey ( lbqs ) contains 1055 qsos in the magnitude range @xmath37 and redshift range @xmath38 ( hewett et al .",
    "the faint magnitude limits for the 18 fields range from @xmath39 to @xmath40 and the bright magnitude limit is @xmath41 for the entire sample . in order to transform from @xmath42 to @xmath31 magnitudes the color equation of blair and gilmore ( 1982 ) [ bj ] b = b_j + 0.28 ( b - v ) was used assuming an average @xmath43 of @xmath44 for the entire sample .",
    "when we combine this sample with the aat sample and others we introduce artificial cutoffs at @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are the completeness limits for the aat data .",
    "in addition , we removed all objects brighter than @xmath47 in order to insure completeness near the bright magnitude limit , leaving a total of 871 objects .",
    "data from the six deepest fields of the homogeneous bright qso survey ( hbqs ) were published by cristiani et al .",
    "( 1995 ) the six deepest fields of the hbqs contain either @xmath42 or @xmath48 magnitudes for 285 qsos in the range @xmath49 , with faint magnitude limits ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath40 .",
    "the bright magnitude limits are generally lower than those of the lbqs , varying from @xmath51 to @xmath41 . for observations in the @xmath42 band equation ( [ bj ] )",
    "was used and for observations in the @xmath48 band the equation b = b + 0.11 ( b - v ) of blair and gilmore ( 1982 ) was used assuming @xmath52 . again , when combining this sample only objects in the redshift range @xmath33 were used , leaving a total of @xmath53 objects .",
    "the durham / aat survey contains @xmath54 qsos in the magnitude range @xmath55 ( boyle et al .",
    "1990 ) and redshift range @xmath33 , giving information about the qso luminosity function in a different regime than the previous two samples .",
    "the faint magnitude limit ranges from @xmath56 to @xmath57 and the bright magnitude limit ranges from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the data are given in the `` @xmath60 '' magnitude system , which according to boyle et al .",
    "( 1990 ) may be converted into the @xmath31 system by the relation b = b + 0.23 ( b - v - 0.9 ) .",
    "as above , the average value @xmath61 was used to determine @xmath31 .",
    "a subsample of the edinburgh qso survey ( eqs ) consisting of @xmath62 qsos brighter than @xmath47 was published by goldschmidt et al . in 1992 . of these",
    ", the @xmath63 that fall in the redshift range @xmath33 were added to the combined samples to give information about the luminosity function at the bright end .",
    "there have been several previous analyses of the above quasar surveys .",
    "boyle et al . ( 1990 ) used binning techniques to fit the the durham / aat data to the ple model .",
    "more recently , la franca and cristiani ( 1996 ) fit the lbqs and hbqs data to a more complex luminosity function ( involving 3 or more parameters ) with no density evolution .",
    "hatziminaoglou et al .",
    "( 1998 ) examined the ple and pde cases separately using both the durham / aat and lbqs data .",
    "as described below , we combine all of these data and determine both the luminosity evolution @xmath13 and the density evolution @xmath64 .",
    "the statistical problem at hand is the determination of the true distribution of luminosities and redshifts of the sources from a biased or truncated data set , such as a flux limited sample .",
    "several different techniques exist that give such a determination .",
    "the most common method is to bin the data and fit to some parametric forms of @xmath65 or @xmath64 .",
    "however , it is preferable to avoid binning and to use non - parametric methods whenever possible . for a review of the various methods",
    "see petrosian ( 1992 ) . assuming the general form of equation ( [ eq : gle ] ) for the luminosity function we must determine the functional forms of the local luminosity function @xmath66 , density evolution @xmath64 and the luminosity evolution @xmath13 as well as the changes in the parameters @xmath21 with redshift , if any .",
    "this last aspect is a higher order effect and will not be within the scope of this paper .",
    "we will discuss the certainty with which this can be ignored in the final analysis .",
    "all non - parametric techniques for determining the distribution in a bivariate setting require that the data be expressed in terms of two uncorrelated variables , i.e. that we use variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 for which the density function is separable : @xmath69 .",
    "thus before applying non - parametric methods one must first determine the degree of correlation of the data in the @xmath70 plane .",
    "this determination and the process of removing the correlation is equivalent to a determination of the functional form of the luminosity evolution @xmath13 and the subsequent transformation @xmath71 .",
    "this can not be accomplished easily by non - parametric methods .",
    "therefore , we chose two parametric forms for the luminosity evolution , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and find the values of the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 for which @xmath76 and @xmath12 are uncorrelated .",
    "once this is done , the non - parametric methods described in petrosian ( 1992 ) may be used to determine @xmath64 and @xmath77 .",
    "the methods normally used to test correlation and determine the distributions are suited for simple truncations , such as @xmath78 ( which by defining @xmath79 can be reduced to the generic case of @xmath80 ) .",
    "this is sufficient for simple flux limited data .",
    "however , the majority of astronomical data , and quasar data in particular , suffer from more than one truncation .",
    "the data may have an upper as well as a lower truncation , @xmath81 , or there may be similar truncations in the value of the other variable .",
    "in addition , the functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 may not be continuous or even single valued . in general ,",
    "multiply truncated redshift - magnitude data may be written as @xmath84 , [ m^-_i , m^+_i]\\}_{i=1}^n$ ] where @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] are the observational limits on @xmath12 and @xmath87 for the @xmath88 object , respectively .",
    "given a cosmological model @xmath89 this gives data of the form @xmath90 , [ l^-_i , l^+_i]\\}_{i=1}^n$ ] .",
    "if one assumes that each object has the same redshift limits @xmath85 $ ] , which is the case in the majority of our analyses , then the problem is to test the correlation and distribution of @xmath67 and @xmath68 from a data set @xmath91 given truncation limits @xmath92 $ ] for each point .",
    "the previous methods developed for this test ( see petrosian 1992 and efron and petrosian 1992 ) are suited for one sided truncations . in a more recent work ( efron and petrosian 1998 )",
    "we have developed methods , which are a generalization of the earlier methods , for dealing with doubly truncated data .",
    "we will briefly review these new methods of testing correlation and non - parametrically determining the density evolution and luminosity function .",
    "if @xmath67 and @xmath68 are independent then the rank @xmath93 of @xmath94 in an untruncated sample ( i.e. a sample truncated parallel to the @xmath67 and @xmath68 axes , so that @xmath95 are independent of @xmath94 ) will be distributed uniformly between @xmath34 and @xmath96 with an expected mean @xmath97 and variance @xmath98 . one may then normalize @xmath93 to have a mean of @xmath99 and a variance of @xmath34 by defining the statistic @xmath100 .",
    "one then rejects or accepts the hypothesis of independence based on the distribution of the @xmath101 .",
    "one simple way of doing so is by defining a single statistic @xmath102 based on the @xmath101 with a mean of @xmath99 and a variance of @xmath34 .",
    "one then rejects the hypothesis of independence if @xmath103 is too large ( e.g. @xmath104 for rejection of independence at the @xmath105 level ) .",
    "the quantity [ taudef_1a ] = _ i ( r_i - e ) is one choice of such a test statistic .",
    "this @xmath106 is equivalent to kendell s @xmath106 statistic , which is defined in the following manner .",

    ".      a straightforward application of this method to truncated data will clearly give a false correlation signal .",
    "efron and petrosian ( 1992 ) , and independently tsai ( 1990 ) , describe how this method can be applied to data with one - sided truncation , i.e. either @xmath111 or @xmath112 . for example , if @xmath113 but @xmath114 varies with @xmath94 then the above procedure is modified as follows . for each object",

    "the rest of the procedure follows as for untruncated data .",
    "the normalized statistic @xmath101 is defined here as @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "the method is equivalent to the previous method , with the eligible set defined as j_i = \\ { j : y_j > y_i ,  y_i ( y_j^- , y_j^+ ) } and the set of allowed pairings = \\ { ( i , j ) : y_i ( y^-_j , y^+_j),y_j ( y^-_i , y^+_i ) } defined such that each object lies within the truncation region of the other .    in this case , however , the distribution of the rankings ( or of @xmath106 ) is unknown .",
    "if the data are uncorrelated then @xmath106 must still have a mean of zero and a bootstrap method may be used to determine the variance @xmath124 as follows . by assuming the data @xmath125 are uncorrelated one can use the methods of the next section to determine @xmath126 , the underlying ( i.e. non - truncated ) probability distribution of @xmath68 . once @xmath126",

    "however , if @xmath134 then @xmath135 and @xmath12 can not be considered independent and one may assume that the most likely explanation is the presence of luminosity evolution ( @xmath136 constant ) .",
    "another possibility is the variation of the shape parameters @xmath21 with @xmath12 .",
    "we will return to this possibility below .",
    "one can determine the function @xmath13 parametrically as follows .",
    "given a parametric form for luminosity evolution @xmath72 one can transform the luminosities into @xmath137 and proceed with the determination of the correlation @xmath138 between @xmath76 and @xmath12 as a function of the parameter @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath106 is normalized to have a standard deviation of @xmath34 , then the values of @xmath74 allowed by the data at the @xmath139 confidence level are @xmath140 , and the most likely values of @xmath74 are those with @xmath141 .",
    "although in principle it is possible for the function @xmath142 to have several zeroes , this did not occur for the specific cases described in @xmath28 .      once a function @xmath143 is found that removes the correlation between @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( or @xmath12 and @xmath135 ) , the task is to find the underlying distributions @xmath144 ( the density evolution ) and @xmath145 ( the local luminosity function ) given uncorrelated data @xmath146 and truncation limits @xmath147 $ ] .",
    "if the truncation is one - sided ( e.g. @xmath148 for all @xmath149 ) then a variety of non - parametric methods can be used to determine the univariate distribution functions .",
    "as shown by petrosian ( 1992 ) all non - parametric methods reduce to lynden - bell s ( 1971 ) method . as with the tests of correlation described above",
    ", the gist of this method is to find for each point the comparable set defined in equation ( [ eq : jdef ] ) and the number @xmath118 of points in this set .",
    "for example , the cumulative distribution in @xmath150 , @xmath151 , is given by ( y_i ) = _ j < i ( 1 + 1 n_j ) .",
    "for doubly truncated data the comparable set is not completely observed , thus a simple analytic method such as the one described above is not possible .",
    "however , it turns out that a simple iterative procedure can lead to a maximum likelihood estimate of the distributions . here",
    "we give a brief description of this method ; for details the reader is referred to efron and petrosian ( 1998 ) .",
    "assume that the underlying density function @xmath126 is discretely distributed over the @xmath96 observed values of @xmath68 .",
    "if we let @xmath152 be the probability density at @xmath153 then @xmath154 , where the summation includes all data points for which @xmath155 $ ] , is the total probability density for the truncation region @xmath92 $ ] .",

    "thus we have reduced the problem of finding the density function for data with arbitrary truncation to the `` moral equivalent '' of an eigenvalue problem for the matrix @xmath156 .    in practice , this condition may be used as a recursive formula to determine @xmath162 .",
    "one starts with an initial guess for the density vector @xmath169 .",
    "equation ( [ likely ] ) then gives the recursion relation [ recursive ] 1 ^(j+1 ) = * j^ * 1 ^(j ) + c^(j ) where the constant @xmath170 is determined by the normalization condition @xmath171 .",
    "one may use as an initial guess the untruncated solution @xmath172 . in most problems , however , one of the two truncations will have a more pronounced effect than the other .",
    "in this case , one may ignore the weaker truncation and use the result based on the one - sided method as an an initial guess .",
    "we found that with this initial guess and data confined to one region of the @xmath173 plane the sequence of @xmath174 defined by equation ( [ recursive ] ) usually converged quickly .",
    "however , for combined samples spanning different regions of the @xmath173 plane it was helpful to use an algorithm to accelerate the convergence of the series of @xmath174 . for this purpose we used aitken s @xmath175 method , which gives an improved estimate for the terms of series by assuming approximately geometric convergence ( see , e.g. press et al .",

    "in order to determine the intrinsic parameters of an object from the observed data one must assume a certain cosmological model . many cosmological models may be described in terms of a few fundamental parameters , which ( see e.g. peebles 1993 ) for a matter dominated ( non - relativistic ) universe are the matter density @xmath176 , the cosmological constant @xmath177 and the curvature of space @xmath74 ( which is @xmath178 , @xmath99 or @xmath179 for closed , flat or open universes , respectively ) . using hubble s constant @xmath180",

    "for example , the curvature term may be written _",
    "k = 1 - ( _ m + _ ) .",
    "we will consider the two classes of cosmological models given by @xmath183 ( no cosmological constant ) and @xmath184 ( flat universe with cosmological constant ) .",
    "for calculations of the luminosity function we will pay particular attention to the two cases @xmath185 and @xmath186 , @xmath187 .",
    "the first of these is the standard einstein - de sitter model , and the second is an inflationary model with parameters in accordance with current observations . for definiteness , hubble s constant",
    "was assumed to be @xmath188 , although most results are independent of this assumption .",
    "once the values of the cosmological parameters are fixed , calculations of intrinsic parameters are relatively straightforward ( peebles 1993 ) .",
    "the absolute luminosity , for example , takes the form [ eq : ldef ] l = f 4 d_l^2 k ( z ) where @xmath189 is the observed flux , the luminosity distance @xmath190 is d_l = c h_o ( 1 + z ) and @xmath191 is the k - correction term .",
    "the co - moving coordinate distance is u(z ) = _ 0^z dz and the co - moving volume contained within a sphere of radius corresponding to redshift @xmath12 is [ eq : vdef ] v(z ) = 4 ( c h_o ) _ 0^z du dz d_l^2 ( 1+z)^2 dz . in general , these integrals must be evaluated numerically .    in order to determine the k - correction term @xmath191 one must make an assumption about the quasar spectrum in the optical region .",
    "the general practice here is to assume a power law spectrum @xmath192 with spectral index @xmath193 , which gives @xmath194 .",
    "two models for luminosity evolution were used : @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",

    "the second model assumes a power law dependence on the scale factor of the universe ( or the expansion parameter @xmath200 ) , which is independent of the cosmological parameters .",
    "analyses of earlier data ( see e.g. caditz and petrosian 1990 ) have traditionally given estimates of quasar evolution for these two parametric forms of @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "in what follows we apply the procedures of @xmath26 to determine the correlation between the luminosities and redshifts and test parametric forms for the evolution of the luminosity , the function @xmath13 .",
    "then we transform all luminosities to their present epoch values @xmath14 and determine the co - moving density evolution @xmath64 and the present epoch luminosity function @xmath77 for the cosmological models described in @xmath27 .",
    "we apply these tests to the surveys described in @xmath25 individually and in various combinations . before presenting these results",
    "we discuss briefly the redshift - magnitude data , i.e. the hubble diagram shown in figure @xmath34 .",
    "as is evident from figure @xmath34 , at first glance there seems to be very little correlation between the redshifts and magnitudes ( or fluxes ) of quasars ; i.e. there is no obvious evidence for a hubble type relation .",
    "this result is well known .",
    "for example , a preliminary test of correlation between @xmath87 and @xmath12 in a small subsample by efron and petrosian ( 1992 , figure 6 ) showed no correlation .",
    "earlier , the absence of a clear hubble relation was used as an argument against the cosmological origin of quasar redshift ( see , e.g. burbidge and odell 1973 ) .",
    "this is not the only possible interpretation , however .",
    "one would not expect a simple hubble diagram for sources with a broad luminosity function ( non - standard candle sources , see e.g. petrosian 1974 ) .",
    "the absence of an obvious hubble relation can also arise from approximate cancelation between cosmological dimming and luminosity evolution .",
    "exact cancelation of these two effects is highly implausible and could bring into question the basic assumptions about the distribution of sources .",
    "to clarify this situation we have applied the correlation tests described in @xmath26 to the surveys of @xmath25 . first ignoring the high flux ( low magnitude ) limit , i.e. with @xmath203",
    ", we use the one - sided tests and find the results labeled @xmath204 shown in table 1 . when using the double - sided tests we find the results @xmath205 , which indicate slightly less correlation , as expected because the one - sided methods ignore the slight truncation induced by the high flux limits .",
    "these tests , when applied to the combined data sets , give a correlation of @xmath206 .",
    "this result rejects the hypothesis of independence between @xmath31 and @xmath12 at the @xmath207 confidence level and is independent of any cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , we may test the parametric fit @xmath208 constant for the data using the methods for multiple truncations to determine the best value of @xmath209 , i.e. the value for which @xmath210 and @xmath12 are uncorrelated ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "a value of @xmath212 is what one would expect for standard candle sources with a very narrow luminosity function , while a value of @xmath213 would mean the complete absence of a hubble relation and the exact cancelation described above .",
    "the results shown in table @xmath34 indicate that @xmath209 , while clearly less than @xmath214 , differs significantly from @xmath99 for the cosmological models discussed in @xmath27 .",
    "the best parametric fit for the einstein - de sitter cosmological model ( @xmath215 ) is shown in figure 1 along with the expected relation for standard candle sources ( @xmath212 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      figures 3a and 3b display the best values and the @xmath139 ranges for the evolution parameter @xmath74 assuming both @xmath217 and @xmath184 cosmological models for the different samples .",
    "the durham / aat data exhibit much stronger evolution than the other data , indicating that this form of evolution does not adequately describe the data in the entire @xmath173 plane .",
    "the values of @xmath74 found for most of the data sets are considerably less than the previously determined value @xmath218 by caditz and petrosian ( 1990 ) , which was dominated by the durham / aat data .",
    "figures 4a and 4b give results for the evolution parameter @xmath75 for the same cosmological models as above .",
    "the allowed ranges obtained from the different samples are much closer , thus this form of evolution is shown to be a closer approximation to the actual evolution than the exponential form . for the einstein - de sitter model , the best value of evolution parameter is @xmath220 with a one @xmath4 range of @xmath221 $ ] . as with the previous case ,",
    "the values of @xmath75 are somewhat less than the previously found value of @xmath222 of caditz and petrosian ( 1990 ) .",
    "it is clear that a better fit can be achieved with a different functional form for @xmath13 with two or more parameters .",
    "however , in what follows we assume the simpler form of evolution @xmath223 with @xmath224 the optimal value of @xmath75 for a given cosmological model @xmath89 .",
    "we therefore transform the data to @xmath225\\}_{i=1}^n$ ] with @xmath226 and apply the method of @xmath26 to find non - parametric estimates for the density functions @xmath64 and @xmath77 .",
    "this method now gives directly the cumulative functions @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the cumulative density function @xmath229 is the total number of objects within the angular area of the survey up to redshift @xmath12 .",
    "if there is no density evolution , i.e. @xmath230 is a constant , then @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the co - moving volume up to redshift @xmath12 .",
    "we determine @xmath233 and @xmath64 using the new method for doubly truncated data . in order to determine if density evolution exists we fit @xmath4 to @xmath234 by a simple power law @xmath235 , where @xmath236 indicates the presence of density evolution .",
    "if the density increases with redshift we expect @xmath237 and if the density decreases with redshift we expect @xmath238",
    ". even if @xmath239 , however , density evolution may be present : the density may increase and decrease in such a way as to cancel and give a fit of @xmath239 .",
    "figures 5a and 5b show the variation of @xmath4 and @xmath240 with @xmath234 for the combined sample for three different cosmological models .",
    "the dotted lines show the best fits to the form @xmath241^\\lambda$ ] . for the einstein - de sitter model ( top curves in figure 5 ) we have @xmath242 , indicating that the co - moving density increases with redshift roughly as @xmath243 .",
    "this would indicate a simple power law density evolution @xmath244 .",
    "the density evolution shown in figure 5b exhibits this average behavior , but in detail is more complex : the density increases more rapidly at low @xmath12 , reaches a plateau at @xmath245 and possibly decreases at higher @xmath12 . this behavior will be discussed below in more detail and for higher redshift data .    as mentioned in  1 , one can not determine the evolution of sources ( the function @xmath18 ) and the evolution of the universe ( the parameters @xmath246 ) simultaneously .",
    "given one of these ( e.g. the cosmological model ) , the other ( the density evolution ) may be determined from the data .",
    "the variation of @xmath247 with @xmath248 for the two different classes of cosmological models is shown in figures 6a and 6b .",
    "it is evident that there is a monotonic variation of @xmath249 with @xmath248 . in particular , @xmath239 for the two cosmological models : @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 , @xmath253 .",
    "this second set of parameters is quite close to those currently favored by many observations .",
    "as above , this does not imply the complete absence of density evolution .",
    "the lower two curves in figure 5b show the variation of @xmath240 for these two models . clearly , there is less variation than for the einstein - de sitter model , but the general behavior is similar .    to further analyze the variation of @xmath64 , in figure 7",
    "we show our non - parametric determination of @xmath64 for the einstein - de sitter cosmological model .",
    "two sets of results are given .",
    "the first of these ( depicted by squares ) shows @xmath64 in the region @xmath33 from the combined data .",
    "the second ( triangles ) shows @xmath64 in the region @xmath254 from the lbqs data ( which do not have a high redshift cutoff at @xmath46 ) alone . as evident in figure 7",
    ", the density increases relatively slowly at low redshift ( @xmath255 ) before reaching a peak at @xmath9 and decreasing rapidly ( @xmath256 ) at higher redshift . as discussed further in  5.5 ,",
    "the decrease in density present in this data at redshift of about 2 is in agreement with high redshift survey results ( schmidt et al .",
    "1995 , warren et al .",
    "1994 ) .      in a similar fashion we may obtain the cumulative luminosity function @xmath6 from the uncorrelated data set @xmath257 .",
    "figures 8a and 8b show @xmath6 for the combined data set with @xmath258 , along with the best fits to a double power law form [ eq : doublepow ] ( l_o ) = _ o ( l_o / l_)^k_1 + ( l_o / l_)^k_2 .",
    "we used the cosmological models @xmath259 , @xmath260 ( einstein - de sitter model ) and @xmath261 , @xmath186 ( pure luminosity evolution with cosmological constant ) . in both cases , the results for the combined samples exhibit roughly double power law dependence on @xmath76 with similar values of the fitting parameters",
    "the primary differences between the two models are that the einstein - de sitter model gives a slightly gentler slope above the break luminosity , @xmath262 as opposed to @xmath263 , and a lower break luminosity , @xmath264 erg / ( sec hz ) as opposed to @xmath265 erg / ( sec hz ) .",
    "we check for possible variation in the shape of @xmath77 by dividing the data into three redshift bins : @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 .",
    "we then find the differential luminosity function @xmath77 for these three redshift bins , first assuming no luminosity evolution ( @xmath269 constant ) and then assuming luminosity evolution @xmath223 .",
    "these luminosity functions ( with arbitrary vertical normalization ) are shown in figures 9a and 9b , respectively .",
    "the presence of a strong shift to higher luminosities is clearly evident for @xmath269 constant .",
    "however , when the evolution @xmath223 is taken out the luminosity function seems to exhibit little variation ; the slopes appear roughly the same at low @xmath76 and high @xmath76 and the break luminosity does not vary as much with redshift .",
    "although imprecise , these results indicate that our choice of @xmath13 removes most of the variation of the parameters @xmath21 with redshift , i.e. the shape of the luminosity function is almost invariant .      finally , we determine the luminosity density function @xmath10 .",
    "this quantity is defined as the total rate of energy production by quasars in the optical range as a function of redshift ; @xmath270 .",
    "if the shape of the luminosity function is invariant then @xmath271 .",
    "this rate depends in a complicated way on the distribution of masses of the central black holes and the variation of the accretion rate , both of which are related to the formation of galaxies and their evolution through mergers or collisions . using the above results we can evaluate @xmath272 up to a redshift of @xmath273 .",
    "we extend this further to a redshift of @xmath274 using the lbqs data , which is claimed to be complete up to this redshift .",
    "these results , with arbitrary vertical normalization , are shown in figure 10 .",
    "we first note the good agreement in the @xmath275 region , indicating that perhaps the lbqs result at higher redshift is a representative behavior .",
    "we may also use high redshift surveys of quasars ( schmidt et al .",
    "1995 , warren et al .",
    "1994 ) to study @xmath272 in this range .",
    "unfortunately , the selection of high @xmath12 quasars in these samples is more complicated and the subsequent analyses involve more assumptions .",
    "for example , schmidt et al .",
    "use the @xmath276 method to determine @xmath64 , tacitly assuming that @xmath269 constant ( as well as @xmath277 constant ) so that @xmath278 .",
    "we show these results ( again with arbitrary vertical normalization ) in figure 10 .",
    "these results agree with the general trend of decline in @xmath10 at high redshifts .",
    "it has been claimed ( cavaliere and vittorini 1998 , shaver et al .",
    "1998 ) that this rise and fall of @xmath10 with redshift is similar to the behavior of the star formation rate ( sfr ) , which has recently been extended to high redshift ( see , e.g. madau 1997 ) .",
    "we have shown this rate in figure 10 as well .",
    "although the general trend of rise and fall of the sfr and @xmath10 is the same , there is considerable difference in the detailed variation .",
    "the similarity may indicate some relation between the sfr and the feeding of the central engine of the quasars ( e.g. both are affected by mergers ) .",
    "however , considering the many differences between star formation and the generation of energy by quasars , the observed difference between the sfr and @xmath10 in figure 10 is not surprising .",
    "although there have been several analyses of quasar evolution in the past , our results differ from these previous results in two important respects :            @xmath279 the methods are not limited to simply truncated data such as that found in flux limited surveys and can account for selection biases in generally truncated data where each data point has different truncation limits . in particular , these methods can treat samples with both upper and lower flux limits and redshift limits .",
    "@xmath279 the first of our techniques , a generalized non - parametric test of independence , allows one to determine the degree of correlation between luminosity and redshift , giving an indication of the luminosity evolution in the luminosity function .",
    "the evolution may then be determined parametrically .",
    "@xmath279 the second of our techniques provides a non - parametric estimate for the univariate distributions in redshift and luminosity , i.e. the co - moving density evolution and the local luminosity function , respectively .",
    "we have applied these methods to the combined data from several large surveys and determined the luminosity evolution @xmath13 , the density evolution @xmath64 and the luminosity function @xmath280 of the generalized luminosity function of equation ( [ eq : gle ] ) for flat ( @xmath184 and @xmath281 ) and zero cosmological constant ( @xmath217 and @xmath282 ) cosmological models .",
    "we assume a shape invariant luminosity function , @xmath277 constant .",
    "more complex luminosity functions , @xmath283 constant , or those with luminosity dependent density evolution , etc .",
    ", can be tested if the simpler prescription used here is not consistent with all of the data .",
    "we found that the scenario of equation ( [ eq : gle ] ) provides an adequate description of the existing data .",
    "@xmath279 the parametric model of luminosity evolution @xmath284 provides a better description of the data than the model @xmath285 , although neither parameterization perfectly removes the correlation in all areas of the @xmath173 plane . in order to better model this evolution future analyses of quasar evolution",
    "could consider other parametric forms , including those with more than one free parameter .",
    "@xmath279 the cumulative co - moving density of quasars may be approximately modeled as @xmath286 , where the value of @xmath249 depends on the cosmological model .",
    "for example , @xmath287 for the einstein - de sitter model and @xmath239 for the cosmological models with @xmath250 , @xmath288 and @xmath252 , @xmath253 .",
    "this simple parameterization @xmath289 does not describe precisely the variation of @xmath240 with redshift .",
    "when examined in greater detail , the co - moving density shows a relatively slow increase ( @xmath255 ) for low redshifts and a rapid decline ( @xmath256 ) for @xmath290 ( for the einstein - de sitter model ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the observed density evolution of high @xmath12 quasars ( schmidt et al .",
    "1995 , warren et al .",
    "qualitatively similar behavior is found even for models that show no overall density evolution ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "a more rigorous comparison can not be made at this stage because the analysis of the high @xmath12 data ignores possible @xmath173 correlation and assumes pure density evolution .",
    "@xmath279 the cumulative local luminosity function @xmath291 has a double power law form . in the einstein - de sitter model",
    "the break luminosity is @xmath292 erg / ( sec hz ) and the low and high luminosity power law indices are @xmath293 and @xmath262 .",
    "there appears to be little variation with redshift of the shape of the cumulative and differential luminosity functions , thus the @xmath21 = constant prescription seems adequate . with more data one could determine precisely the variation with redshift of the shape of @xmath294 .",
    "@xmath279 the above description of the luminosity function allows us to determine the rate of energy generation per unit co - moving volume of quasars as a function of redshift .",
    "we show that this function @xmath295 increases rapidly with @xmath12 at low redshift , peaks around @xmath9 and then decreases .",
    "this is also in rough agreement with the high @xmath12 survey results mentioned above .",
    "this variation of @xmath272 is similar to but significantly different from recent determinations of the star formation rate .",
