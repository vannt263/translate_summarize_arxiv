    "the angular distribution of final state electrons from the process @xmath10 can be written as    @xmath11    where @xmath4 is the angle between an electron and the @xmath12 direction in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system .",
    "the value of the angular distribution parameter , @xmath5 , is determined by the @xmath7 helicity formation amplitudes in @xmath8    @xmath13    with the normalization condition @xmath14 + 2@xmath15 = 1 .    in the limit of infinitely heavy charm mass ,",
    "the hadron helicity conservation rule implies @xmath16  @xcite for both @xmath9 and @xmath7 decays to octet baryon anti - baryon pairs .",
    "small but not negligible deviations from this prediction are expected based on constituent quark@xcite or hadron mass effect@xcite from @xmath17 and higher twist corrections to the qcd effective lagrangian , while electromagnetic corrections are expected to be negligible@xcite .",
    "there are several measurements of @xmath5 in j/@xmath18 decays to baryon anti - baryon pairs @xcite .",
    "only an indirect measurement ( with large error ) based on @xmath19 , has been reported for @xmath5 at the @xmath7@xcite , and the uncertainty in @xmath7 helicity formation amplitudes is the major source of systematic error on the @xmath7 branching ratios measured in e760 and e835@xcite .    the measurement of @xmath5 at the @xmath7 presented here is based on a sample of 6844 fully reconstructed @xmath20 events with negligible ( @xmath21 ) background .",
    "the detector and the experimental technique are described in detail in  @xcite . here",
    "we recall only the features relevant to the present work .",
    "the experiment was located in the antiproton accumulator ( aa ) ring at fermilab .",
    "the stochastically cooled antiproton beam ( @xmath22 ) circulating in the aa passed through an internal hydrogen gas - jet target .",
    "the energy of the beam could be tuned to the charmonium resonance of interest , in this case the @xmath7 .",
    "the e835 detector was a nonmagnetic spectrometer with cylindrical symmetry about the beam axis .",
    "the inner part of the detector contained a system for precise tracking of charged particles and four scintillator hodoscopes used variously for triggering and @xmath23 measurement .",
    "outside the inner detectors was a 16 cell threshold erenkov counter to identify electrons at the trigger level and offline ; the erenkov covered the polar angle range from 15@xmath24 to 65@xmath24 .",
    "two electromagnetic calorimeters used to measure the angles and energies of photons and electrons completed the detector .",
    "the central calorimeter ( ccal ) , composed of 1280 lead - glass erenkov counters arranged in a pointing geometry , covered the polar angle region from 11@xmath24 to 70@xmath24 .",
    "the energy resolution of the ccal was @xmath25 .",
    "given the size of the target region ( @xmath26  @xmath27  @xmath27  cm ) , the angular resolution for photons and electrons was 6  mrad in polar angle ( @xmath28 ) and 11  mrad in azimuth ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the forward calorimeter which covered the region from 3@xmath24 to 11@xmath24 is not used in this analysis .",
    "the luminosity was measured by a set of solid state detectors which counted recoil protons from elastic scatters at 90@xmath24 .",
    "the calorimeter channels were equipped with both adc s to record pulse height and tdc s to record the time with respect to the trigger .",
    "the latter allowed signals from accidentals within the adc gate to be ignored thus maintaining analysis efficiency at high luminosity .",
    "signals were labelled ` in - time ' if they were within @xmath610   ns of the trigger , ` out - of - time ' if they were outside this range .",
    "channels with no timing information ( the tdc threshold for small energy deposits was @xmath30  mev ) were labelled ` undetermined ' .",
    "two sets of @xmath7 data from different data taking periods ( 1996 - 1997 and 2000 ) were used for this analysis .",
    "the total luminosity for these data sets is 22.57  pb@xmath31 : 10.09 pb@xmath31 for the 1996 - 1997 run and 12.48 pb@xmath31 for the 2000 run .",
    "the typical instantaneous luminosity during data taking was @xmath32@xmath33s@xmath31 .",
    "the hardware trigger was designed to accept events with a large - mass @xmath34  pair within the acceptance of the central calorimeter .",
    "it required two  electron tracks \" , defined by the appropriate coincidence of the inner and outer scintillator hodoscopes and the corresponding cell of the erenkov counter , and independently two large energy deposits ( clusters ) in ccal separated by @xmath35 in azimuth , with an invariant mass @xmath36 gev .",
    "offline reconstruction of electron showers in the ccal was performed clustering all hits in a 5@xmath375 grid around a central block ( _ seed _ ) with at least 50  mev energy deposit .",
    "if the `` cluster mass '' defined as    @xmath38    exceeded @xmath39  mev , the cluster is considered as originating from two overlapping e.m .",
    "showers and it is split into two distinct clusters .",
    "the values for the seed energy ( 50  mev ) and the cluster splitting mass ( 120  mev ) are specific to the @xmath40 channel and were chosen to ensure reasonably uniform efficiency over the angular acceptance .",
    "a preliminary selection , aimed at generic @xmath41 channels , required the two highest energy clusters in the calorimeter to have @xmath422.6  gev and to be associated to hits in the erenkov and in at least two of the three scintillators . to reject background , largely due to dalitz decay or photon conversions of @xmath43s misidentified as single electrons , we calculate the likelihood ratio ( ew ) of the electron and background hypothesis ( described in detail in @xcite ) and require that @xmath44 .",
    "a four constraint kinematic fit to the hypothesis @xmath45 is performed on all events with two high energy clusters ( candidate electron - positron pair ) .",
    "events with no extra clusters were retained if the nominal @xmath46 probability @xmath47 .",
    "events with up to two extra clusters ( either on - time or undetermined ) were also retained if the @xmath48 .",
    "this was done to retain events where the high energy electron shower was not contained within the 5x5 grid or the electron had radiated a bremsstrahlung photon in the material in front of the calorimeter .    to avoid possible contamination from @xmath19 events ,",
    "we finally require that @xmath49  gev ( see fig .  [ mee ] ) .",
    "the amount of material in front of the calorimeter and the size of the calorimeter counters both varied with angle .",
    "this means that the probability of bremsstrahlung and the number of low energy satellite clusters distinct from the high energy cluster could vary with angle .",
    "a full monte carlo ( mc ) detector simulation based on geant  @xcite was performed to evaluate the efficiency correction as a function of @xmath50 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ eff ] ) .    with the cuts chosen , the efficiency is essentially independent of angle .    to ensure uniform efficiency we limit our acceptance to @xmath51 , where the efficiency ranges between 0.83 and 0.93 .",
    "the bin by bin differences depend mainly on the ccal counters geometry ( including two dead channels ) that are accurately modelled in the mc .",
    "the statistical error on the efficiency due to the size of the mc sample ( 330,000 events ) is negligible given the size of our data sample .",
    "the shaded area represents events in the @xmath52 sample . ]     for the 1996 - 1997 ( open circles ) and 2000 ( filled circles ) data sets . ]",
    "the final sample has 2391 and 4457 events from the 1996 - 1997 and 2000 runs , respectively .",
    "there are two possible sources of background events , the first from genuine electrons and positrons from @xmath19 events mis - classified as exclusive @xmath40 decays , the second from events where the electron and positron candidates are from non resonant hadronic events with @xmath43 dalitz decays or photon conversions in the beam pipe .    the backgrounds from mis - classified events",
    "is estimated performing the same analysis on monte carlo samples of 100,000 @xmath7 decays to j/@xmath18 @xmath53 , j/@xmath18 @xmath54@xmath54 and j/@xmath18 @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "we expect less than 1  % contamination and no subtraction is performed .",
    "the background from mis - identified electron - positron pairs is measured using samples of data taken off - resonance , at center of mass energies 3576 mev @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath57 3660 mev in 1996 - 1997 and @xmath58=3666 , 3705 and 3526 mev in 2000 .",
    "the mis - identified background contamination is less than 0.4  % in both runs , and also in this case no background subtraction is performed .",
    "binned likelihood fits were performed on the 1996 - 1997 and the 2000 data sets separately .",
    "data were binned in bins of 2.1@xmath59 , corresponding to the average ccal block polar coverage ( 1.52@xmath59 @xmath60 4.80@xmath59 ) .",
    "the angular dependence of the efficiency correction was taken into account on a bin by bin basis .",
    "results are summarized in table  [ results ] and shown in fig .  [ each ] for each data set .",
    "the systematic errors were estimated by varying the cluster seed threshold and the cluster mass value used in electron shower reconstruction , the kinematic fit @xmath46 probability , the ew cut , and the invariant mass cut used in event selection .",
    "the systematic error , expected to be common to both data sets , has been estimated separately on the two samples for each of the above sources to verify this assumption .",
    "no significant correlation was found between the systematics from different sources , and the total systematic error ( 0.04 ) has been evaluated adding in quadrature the contribution from all sources .",
    "the bin by bin differences in efficiency are smaller than the statistical uncertainty of data in each bin , and the contribution to the systematic error due to the uncertainty in the efficiency correction is negligible compared to other sources .",
    "further details on the analysis and on the systematic error evaluation can be found in @xcite .",
