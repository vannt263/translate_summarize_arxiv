    "very recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* udry et al . ( 2007 ) ) announced the detection of two super - earth planets in the gliese 581 system ; namely , gl  581c with a mass of 5.06  @xmath0 and a semi - major axis of 0.073 au , and gl  581d with 8.3  @xmath0 and 0.25 au .",
    "both mass estimates are minimum masses uncorrected for @xmath1 .",
    "the luminosity of gl  581 can be estimated as @xmath2 with a stellar temperature of @xmath3  k and a stellar age of at least 2 gyr .",
    "the main question is whether any of the two super - earths around gl  581 can harbor life , i.e. , that any of the planets lie within the habitable zone ( hz ) .",
    "typically , stellar hzs are defined as regions around the central star , where the physical conditions are favorable for liquid water to exist at the planet s surface for a period of time long enough for biological evolution to occur ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kasting et al . 1993 ) ) .    in the following ,",
    "we adopt a definition of the hz previously used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* franck et al . ( 2000 ) ) . here",
    "habitability does not just depend on the parameters of the central star , but also on the properties of the planet .",
    "in particular , habitability is linked to the photosynthetic activity of the planet , which in turn depends on the planetary atmospheric co@xmath4 concentration , and is thus strongly influenced by the planetary dynamics .",
    "we call this definition the photosynthesis - sustaining habitable zone ( phz ) . in principle",
    ", this leads to additional spatial and temporal limitations of habitability .",
    "to assess the habitability of a super - earth , i.e. , a rocky planet smaller than 10 earth masses ( ( * ? ?",
    "* valencia et al . 2006 ) ) , an earth - system model is applied to calculate the evolution of the temperature and atmospheric co@xmath4 concentration .",
    "the numerical model couples the stellar luminosity , the silicate - rock weathering rate , and the global energy balance to obtain estimates of the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide @xmath5 , the mean global surface temperature @xmath6 , and the biological productivity @xmath7 as a function of time @xmath8 . the main point is the persistent balance between the co@xmath4 sink in the atmosphere - ocean system and the metamorphic ( plate - tectonic ) sources .",
    "this is expressed through the dimensionless quantities @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the weathering rate , @xmath11 is the continental area , and @xmath12 is the spreading rate normalized by their present values of earth .",
    "the connection between the stellar parameters and the planetary climate can be formulated by using a radiation balance equation .",
    "the evolution of the surface temperature is derived directly from the stellar luminosity , the distance to the central star and the geophysical forcing ratio ( @xmath13 ) . for the investigation of a super - earth under external forcing",
    ", we adopt a model planet with a prescribed continental area .",
    "the fraction of continental area to the total planetary surface is varied between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the thermal history and future of a super - earth is determined by calculating the gfr values .",
    "spreading rates can be derived from the mantle temperature . assuming conservation of energy , the average mantle temperature @xmath16 is obtained as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the density",
    ", @xmath19 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath20 is the heat flow from the mantle , @xmath21 is the energy production rate by decay of radiogenic heat sources in the mantle per unit volume , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the outer and inner radii of the mantle , respectively . the photosynthesis - sustaining hz ( phz )",
    "is defined as the spatial domain encompassing all distances @xmath24 from the central star where the biological productivity is greater than zero , i.e. , @xmath25 in our model , biological productivity is considered to be solely a function of the surface temperature and the co@xmath4 partial pressure in the atmosphere .",
    "our parameterization yields zero productivity for @xmath26c or @xmath27c or @xmath28 bar ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* franck et al . 2000 ) ) . to calculate the spreading rates for a planet with several earth masses ,",
    "the planetary parameters have been adjusted following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* valencia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the planetary radius and @xmath31 is the mass , with subscript @xmath32 denoting earth values",
    ". see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* von bloh et al . ( 2007 ) ) for details and specified parameter values .",
    "the habitable zone around gl  581 for planets with five and eight earth masses has been calculated for @xmath33 .",
    "the results for gl  581c and gl  581d are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , b .",
    "the simulations have been carried out for a maximum co@xmath4 pressure of 5 bar ( light colors ) and 10 bar ( dark colors ) neglecting the cooling effect of co@xmath4 clouds .",
    "the super - earth planet gl  581c is found to be clearly outside the habitable zone . on the other hand",
    ", one might expect that life had a chance to originate on gl  581d because it is near the outer edge of the phz , and for some combination of system parameters even inside the phz ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* von bloh et al . 2007 ) ) .",
    "a planet of eight earth masses has more volatiles than an earth - size planet and can build up a sufficiently dense atmosphere to prevent it from freezing out due to tidal locking .",
    "planets inside the habitable zone around m stars may be tidally locked , which however does not necessarily thwart habitability ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tarter et al . 2007 ) ) .",
    "the modestly eccentric orbit of gl  581d ( @xmath34 ) further supports habitability , even if the maximum co@xmath4 pressure is assumed to be as low as 5 bar .",
    "the appearance of complex life , however , is unlikely due to the rather adverse environmental conditions . to get an ultimate answer to the profound question of life on gl  581d",
    ", we have to await the tpf / darwin missions .",
    "they will allow for the first time the detection of biomarkers in the atmospheres of the two super - earths around gl  581 ."
