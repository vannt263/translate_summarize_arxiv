    "excessive effort is required for modelling and simulation of radiation heat transfer in media with complex optical absorption spectra , like hot gases or plasma @xcite . if the radiation model is part of a larger model for hot , compressible mixtures of various chemically reacting species consisting of complex ions , electrons , neutral molecules etc . , and subject to transonic and turbulent flow , an exact treatment is not nearly possible .",
    "applications range from arc physics in welding or electrical switching @xcite , atomic explosions , up to astrophysics @xcite .",
    "a frequently used approximate radiation model is photo - hydrodynamics , which is based on a two - moment expansion of the radiative transfer equation and a variable eddington factor ( vef ) closure @xcite .",
    "this concept can even be realized in a multiband framework , where the relevant quantities are decomposed according to their spectral properties @xcite .",
    "+ the main problem of photo - hydrodynamic models is the optimal choice of the effective transport parameters , i.e. , the effective absorption coefficients and the eddington factor , which generally depend on the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic variables .",
    "the most prominent examples are the planck mean absorption coefficient for optically thin media , the corresponding rosseland mean for optically thick media @xcite , and the constant eddington factor of @xmath0 for isotropic radiation .",
    "+ besides these special limit cases , the optimal definition of effective transport parameters is not straightforward @xcite .",
    "accurate treatment of the general case is particularly important when radiation in the cross - over range between optically thin and thick limit dominates the physical behavior of a system , or if a medium is simultaneously transparent and opaque for different relevant wavelength bands .",
    "a simple approximate approach to solve that problem can consist in the construction of fitting expressions that interpolate between the limit cases .",
    "this has been done , for instance , by sampson @xcite for the absorption coefficient and by kershaw @xcite for the variable eddington factor .",
    "another suggestion by patch @xcite generalizes heuristically averages , which are exact for special cases .",
    "a very common approach is based on entropy maximization @xcite . however , struchtrup @xcite has pointed out a weakness of this procedure due to the neglect of the of radiation - matter coupling for the determination of the nonequilibrium photon distribution function , which plays indeed a main role for equilibration @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences is that already the rosseland mean aborption coefficient in the near - equilibrium case is not correctly reproduced by a two - moment photo - hydrodynamics with the maximum entropy closure . in this paper",
    ", we propose to use an entropy _ production rate _ principle , and we will show that the limit cases are correctly reproduced and the cross - over between them is provided in a natural way , i.e. , without further model parameters",
    ". + maximization and minimization of the entropy production rate @xmath1 have turned out to be powerful approaches for modelling many complex nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "we mention that whether the optimum of @xmath1 is a maximum or a minimum depends on the type of constraints @xcite and emphasize that entropy production optimization is in general not an exact physical law except near equilibrium , i.e. , in linear deviation from equilibrium .",
    "however , it often provides useful approximate results even far away from equilibrium , provided a predominance of strongly irreversible equilibration processes .",
    "it is also important for the discussion below that the method is not restricted to systems in ( partial ) local equilibrium , i.e. , where the notion of ( probably several ) local temperatures can be introduced ( e.g. , electron and ion temperatures in a plasma , light pencil temperatures for radiation @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "entropy production optimization has been shown to be applicable to local nonequilibrium systems , for instance to knudsen layers in material ablation or evaporation processes @xcite . in such cases ,",

    "essex @xcite has shown that the entropy production rate is minimum in a grey atmosphere in local radiative equilibrium .",
    "also this author has pointed out that a consideration of the interaction between radiation and matter is crucial because it contains the appropriate equilibration , i.e. entropy production , mechanism .",
    "later on , wrfel and ruppel @xcite discussed entropy production rate maximization by introducing an effective chemical potential of the photons , related to their interaction with matter . finally , we mention santillan et al .",

    "the same behavior occurs when @xmath173 becomes large , i.e. , @xmath211 approaches @xmath184 , as can be concluded from the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which indicates that the distribution function of directed photons involves large wave numbers .",
    "in this section we compare our method with the well - known me approach , where the radiation entropy is maximized . especially , effective absorption coefficients and vef are compared for the different explicit cases treated in the previous sections .",
    "the basic drawback of me is the explicit independence of @xmath7 on @xmath12 .",
    "the implicit dependence on @xmath160 via radiation - matter coupling at the _ hydrodynamic _ level ( i.e.,via an @xmath45 and @xmath62-dependence due to the me constraints ) is not able to spectrally resolve the absorption properties in the distribution function .",
    "indeed , one can easily calculate @xmath7 , which is given by @xcite @xmath212 with @xmath45 and @xmath62 dependent lagrange parameters . at this level , information about the absorption spectrum is not contained .",
    "+ on the other hand , according to eq . ( [ maximgen1 ] ) ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath7 obtained from entropy production minimization does explicitely depend on @xmath12 . in subsection [ twoband ]",
    ", it has been shown that there is a significant and easily understandable effect of wave number dependent @xmath12 on the distribution function , and thus also on the effective absorption coefficients and on the vef .",
    "+ first , we note that because of the @xmath160-independece of @xmath213 , the associated vef is a unique function of @xmath45 and @xmath62 , @xmath214 which is the well - known levermore - eddington factor @xcite .",
    "it is also plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] for comparison . for grey matter",
    "the eddington factors obtained by our approach and by me are different , but probably similar enough to justify the use of @xmath215 . for non - grey matter the deviations increase . + the difference in the effective absorption coefficients @xmath69 is more important . in the limit case of weak nonequilibrium , where entropy production minimization reproduces the correct rosseland mean , me gives ( i.e. , up to leading order in @xmath216 ) @xmath217 which is clearly different from the correct rosseland mean ( [ ros ] ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that the two methods yield different results for the transport quantities in equilibrium limit , because the deviation from equilibrium , @xmath218 , is different .",
    "although the zeroth order term @xmath71 is the same and @xmath106 goes to zero , it is @xmath106 which determines the transport coefficients . as an example , we have added the curve for @xmath219 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . while the planck limit ( @xmath200 ) is correctly obtained by me , there is a difference of about @xmath220 to the rosseland limit ( @xmath221 ) for our simple example . as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the me approach is able to reproduce the rosseland mean only if one considers a larger number of moments , which goes beyond a two - moment photo - hydrodynamic description of the photon gas with variables @xmath45 and @xmath222 .",
    "+    a remark on the @xmath160-dependence of our approach is in order .",
    "one might conclude from eq .",
    "( [ sdot ] ) that in the case of vanishing @xmath160 the minimum entropy production rate approach is not defined , while the maximum entropy approach is defined because @xmath160 does not appear .",
    "however , zero @xmath160 means _ absence _ of equilibration . but",
    "maximum entropy requires that equilibration to the associated maximum entropy state already occurred . because for zero @xmath159 there is no process that drives the photon gas towards the associated maximum entropy state , both approaches encounter a similar conceptual problem .",
    "the description of radiative heat transfer with photo - hydrodynamic equations requires a closure procedure to restrict the number of coupled equations .",
    "if radiative energy density @xmath45 and momentum density @xmath46 are to be considered , effective absorption coefficients and a variable eddington factor ( vef ) have to be determined as a function of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . using the minimization of the ( local ) entropy production rate of radiation _ and _ matter",
    ", a closure procedure is introduced that yields the photon distribution function , which depends on the spectral absorption coefficient , and which allows for the calculation of transport coefficients in general .",
    "+ it has been shown that the derived expressions are exact near equilibrium , in the emission limit , and correctly describe directed radiation with a vef @xmath54 . whereas the first fact is not very surprising as minimum entropy production is known to be exact near equilibrium , the other correct limiting behavior demonstrates that entropy production optimization can provide sound and useful results also far from equilibrium .",
    "+ for the general case , effective absorption coefficients and a variable eddington factor are found , which reasonably interpolate between the limiting cases , notably without introduction of any fit parameter .",
    "the variable eddington factor for grey matter is close to the one proposed by kershaw @xcite , and not far from the levermore - eddington factor , which can be derived from a maximum entropy approach .",
    "+ in contrast to our approach , the distribution function obtained from the maximum entropy ( me ) method does not contain the absorption spectrum .",
    "hence , me can not describe frequency resolved absorption effects on the distribution function .",
    "an example of such an effect , which is taken into account by our method , is the enhanced photon equilibration in wave number bands with larger absorption as discussed in sect .",
    "[ twoband ] .",
    "another difference is that in the two - moment photo - hydrodynamic framework , me is unable to reproduce the rosseland mean absorption coefficient in the equilibrium limit . + roughly speaking , the maximum entropy approach is a zero order approximation in the sense that radiation has equilibrated to a conditional maximum entropy state . our approach can be understood as a first order approximation by assuming that the radiation is away from equilibrium and equilibrates according the minimum entropy production method . to summarize",
    ", we conjecture that this method may serve as a useful approach in various radiation heat transfer problems . +",
    "a benchmarking and critical discussion of specific application examples will be necessary in the future .",
    "furthermore , the feasibility of improvements in the framework of multiband extensions @xcite or by taking into account higher order moments should be investigated .",
