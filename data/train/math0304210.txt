    "-5 mm    in recent years a surprising number of significant insights and results in noncommutative algebra have been obtained by using the global techniques of projective algebraic geometry .",
    "this article will survey some of these results .",
    "the classical approach to projective geometry , where one relates a commutative graded domain @xmath0 to the associated variety @xmath1 of homogeneous , nonirrelevant prime ideals , does not generalize well to the noncommutative situation , simply because noncommutative algebras do not have enough ideals .",
    "however , there is a second approach , based on a classic theorem of serre : if @xmath0 is generated in degree one , then the categories @xmath2 of coherent sheaves on @xmath3 and @xmath4 of finitely generated graded @xmath0-modules modulo torsion are equivalent .",
    "surprisingly , noncommutative analogues of this idea work very well and have lead to a number of deep results .",
    "there are two strands to this approach .",
    "first , since @xmath3 can be reconstructed from @xmath2 @xcite we will regard @xmath2 rather than @xmath3 as the variety since this is what generalizes .",
    "thus , given a noncommutative graded @xmath5-algebra @xmath6 generated in degree one we will consider @xmath7 as the corresponding `` noncommutative variety '' ( the formal definitions will be given in a moment ) . in particular , we will regard @xmath8 as a noncommutative curve , respectively surface , if @xmath9 grows linearly , respectively quadratically .",
    "this analogy works well , since there are many situations in which one can pass back and forth between @xmath10 and @xmath8 @xcite and , moreover , substantial geometric techniques can be applied to study @xmath8 .",
    "a survey of this approach may be found in @xcite .",
    "the second strand is more concrete . in order to use algebraic geometry to study noncommutative algebras",
    "we need to be able to create honest varieties from those algebras .",
    "this is frequently possible and such an approach will form the basis of this survey .",
    "once again , the idea is simple : when @xmath10 is commutative , the points of @xmath11 correspond to the graded factor modules @xmath12 for which @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "these modules are still defined when @xmath10 is noncommutative and are called point modules . in many circumstances",
    "the set of all such modules is parametrized by a commutative scheme and that scheme controls the structure of @xmath10 .",
    "this article surveys significant applications of this idea .",
    "notably :    * if @xmath6 is a domain such that @xmath15 grows linearly , then @xmath16 for a curve @xmath3 and @xmath10 can be reconstructed from data on @xmath3 .",
    "thus , noncommutative curves are commutative ( see section  4 ) . *",
    "the noncommutative analogues @xmath8 of the projective plane can be classified . in this case",
    ", the point modules are parametrized by either @xmath17 ( in which case @xmath18 ) or by an cubic curve @xmath19 , in which case data on @xmath20 determines @xmath10 ( see section  2 ) . * for strongly noetherian rings , as defined in section  5 , the point modules are always parametrized by a projective scheme .",
    "however there exist many noetherian algebras @xmath10 for which no such parametrization exists .",
    "this has interesting consequences for the classification of noncommutative surfaces .",
    "we now make precise the definitions that will hold throughout this article .",
    "all rings will be algebras over a fixed , algebraically closed base field @xmath5 ( although most of the results actually hold for arbitrary fields )",
    ". a @xmath5-algebra @xmath10 is called _ connected graded _",
    "( _ cg _ ) if @xmath10 is a finitely generated @xmath21-graded @xmath5-algebra @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "note that this forces @xmath24 for all @xmath14 .",
    "usually , we will assume that @xmath10 is generated in degree one in the sense that @xmath10 is generated by @xmath25 as a @xmath5-algebra .",
    "if @xmath26 is a right noetherian cg ring then define @xmath27 to be the category of finitely generated , @xmath28-graded right @xmath10-modules , with morphisms being graded homomorphisms of degree zero .",
    "define the torsion subcategory , @xmath29 , to be the full subcategory of @xmath27 generated by the finite dimensional modules and write @xmath30 .",
    "we write @xmath31 for the canonical morphism @xmath32 and set @xmath33 .",
    "one can  and often should ",
    "work more generally with all graded @xmath10-modules and all quasi - coherent sheaves of @xmath34-modules , but two categories are enough .    in order to measure the growth of an algebra we use the following dimension function : for a cg ring @xmath22 , the _ gelfand - kirillov dimension _ of @xmath10 is defined to be @xmath35 basic facts about this dimension can be found in @xcite . if @xmath10 is a commutative cg algebra then @xmath36 equals the krull dimension of @xmath10 and hence equals @xmath37 . thus a noncommutative curve , respectively surface ,",
    "will more formally be defined as @xmath8 for a cg algebra @xmath10 with @xmath38 , respectively @xmath39 .",
    "-5 mm    we begin with a historical introduction to the subject .",
    "it really started with the work of artin and schelter @xcite who attempted to classify the noncommutative analogues @xmath10 of a polynomial ring in three variables ( and therefore of @xmath17 ) .",
    "the first problem is one of definition .",
    "a `` noncommutative polynomial ring '' should obviously be a cg ring of finite global dimension , but this is too general , since it includes the free algebra .",
    "one can circumvent this problem by requiring that @xmath9 grows polynomially , but this still does not exclude unpleasant rings like @xmath40 that has global dimension two but is neither noetherian nor a domain .",
    "the solution is to impose a gorenstein condition and this leads to the following definition :    [ asreg ] a cg algebra @xmath10 is called _ as - regular of dimension @xmath41 _ if @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath10 is as - gorenstein ; that is , @xmath44 for @xmath45 but @xmath46 , up to a shift of degree .",
    "one advantage with the gorenstein hypothesis , for as - regular rings of dimension @xmath39 , is that the projective resolution of @xmath5 is forced to be of the form @xmath47 for some @xmath48 and , as artin and schelter show in @xcite , this gives strong information on the hilbert series and hence the defining relations of @xmath10 . in the process they constructed one class of algebras that they were unable to analyse :    [ skl ]",
    "the three - dimensional sklyanin algebra is the algebra @xmath49 where @xmath50 , for a ( known ) set @xmath51 .",
    "the original sklyanin algebra @xmath52 is a @xmath53-dimensional analogue of @xmath54 discovered in @xcite .",
    "independently of @xcite , odesskii and feigin @xcite constructed analogues of @xmath52 in all dimensions and coined the name sklyanin algebra .",
    "see @xcite for applications of sklyanin algebras to another version of noncommutative geometry .",
    "in retrospect the reason @xmath54 is hard to analyse is because it depends upon an elliptic curve and so a more geometric approach is required .",
    "this approach came in @xcite and depended upon the following simple idea .",
    "assume that @xmath10 is a cg algebra that is generated in degree one .",
    "point module _ to be a cyclic graded ( right ) @xmath10-module @xmath55 such that @xmath56 for all @xmath57 .",
    "the notation is justified by the fact that , if @xmath10 were commutative , then such a point module @xmath58 would be isomorphic to @xmath59 $ ] and hence equal to the homogeneous coordinate ring of a point in @xmath11 .",
    "point modules are easy to analyse geometrically and this provides an avenue for using geometry in the study of cg rings .",
    "we will illustrate this approach for @xmath60 .",
    "given a point module @xmath61 write @xmath62 for some @xmath63 and suppose that the module structure is defined by @xmath64 for some @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath66 is one of the relations for @xmath67 , then necessarily @xmath68 , whence @xmath69 .",
    "this defines a subvariety @xmath70 and clearly @xmath71 parametrizes the _ truncated point modules of length three _ : cyclic @xmath10-modules @xmath72 with @xmath73 for @xmath74 . a simple computation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  8) ) shows that @xmath71 is actually the graph of an automorphism @xmath75 of an elliptic curve @xmath76 .",
    "it follows easily that @xmath71 also parametrizes the point modules . as a morphism of point modules ,",
    "@xmath75 is nothing more than the shift functor @xmath77 = m_1\\oplus m_2\\oplus\\cdots.$ ]    the next question is how to use @xmath20 and @xmath75 to understand @xmath54 .",
    "fortunately , one can create a noncommutative algebra from this data that is closely connected to @xmath54 .",
    "this is the _ twisted homogeneous coordinate ring _ of @xmath20 and is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 be a @xmath5-scheme , with a line bundle @xmath78 and automorphism @xmath75 .",
    "set @xmath79 , where @xmath80 denotes the pull - back of @xmath78 along an automorphism @xmath81 .",
    "then the _ twisted homogeneous coordinate ring _ is defined to be the graded vector space @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "the multiplication on @xmath84 is defined by the natural map @xmath85    the ring @xmath86 has two significant properties .",
    "first , the way it has been constructed ensures that the natural isomorphism @xmath87 induces a ring homomorphism @xmath88 . with a little more work using the riemann - roch theorem",
    "one can even show that @xmath89 for some @xmath90 . secondly  and this will be explained in more detail in the next section@xmath91 .",
    "the latter fact allows one to obtain a detailed understanding of the structure of @xmath86 and the former allows one to pull this information back to @xmath67 .",
    "to summarize , the point modules over the sklyanin algebra @xmath54 are determined by an automorphism of an elliptic curve @xmath20 and the geometry of @xmath20 allows one to determine the structure of @xmath54 .",
    "as is shown in @xcite this technique works more generally and this leads to the following theorem .",
    "[ atv - s ] @xcite the as - regular rings @xmath10 of dimension @xmath39 are classified .",
    "they are all noetherian domains with the hilbert series of a weighted polynomial ring @xmath92 $ ] ; thus the @xmath93 can be given degrees @xmath94 other than @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 always maps homomorphically onto a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring @xmath96 , for some scheme @xmath3 .",
    "thus @xmath97 .    in this result ,",
    "artin , tate and van den bergh @xcite classified the algebras generated in degree one , while stephenson @xcite did the general case .",
    "there are strong arguments ( see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  11 ) ) for saying that the noncommutative analogues of the projective plane are precisely the categories @xmath8 , where @xmath10 is an as - regular ring with the hilbert series @xmath98 of the unweighted polynomial ring @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "so consider this class , which clearly includes the sklyanin algebra .",
    "the second paragraph of the theorem can now be refined to say that _ either _ @xmath99 , in which case @xmath100 , _ or _ @xmath101 is a cubic curve in @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the theorem can be interpreted as saying that _ noncommutative projective planes are either equal to @xmath17 or contain a commutative curve @xmath20 . _",
    "-5 mm    the ideas from @xcite outlined in the last section have had many other applications , but before we discuss them we need to analyse twisted homogeneous coordinate rings in more detail .",
    "the following exercise may give the reader a feel for the construction .",
    "[ twisted - p ] perhaps the simplest algebra appearing in the theory of quantum groups is the quantum ( affine ) plane @xmath102 = k\\{x , y\\}/(xy - qyx)$ ] , for @xmath103 .",

    "for the rest of the section , fix a @xmath5-scheme @xmath3 with an invertible sheaf @xmath78 and automorphism @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath106 , the homogeneous coordinate ring @xmath107 is a standard construction and one has serre s fundamental theorem : if @xmath78 is ample then @xmath108 .",
    "as was hinted in the last section , this does generalize to the noncommutative case , provided one changes the definition of ampleness . define @xmath78 to be _ @xmath75-ample _",
    "if , for all @xmath109 , one has @xmath110 for all @xmath111 and all @xmath112 .",
    "the nave generalization of serre s theorem then holds .    [ av ] ( artin - van den bergh @xcite ) let @xmath3 be a projective scheme with an automorphism @xmath75 and let @xmath78 be a @xmath75-ample invertible sheaf . then @xmath96 is a right noetherian cg ring such that @xmath113 .",
    "this begs the question of precisely which line bundles are @xmath75-ample .",
    "a simple application of the riemann - roch theorem shows that @xmath114 and the converse holds for irreducible curves .",
    "this explains why theorem  [ av ] could be applied to the factor of the sklyanin algebra in the last section .    for higher dimensional varieties",
    "the situation is more subtle and is described by the following result , for which we need some notation .",
    "let @xmath3 be a projective scheme and write @xmath115 for the set of cartier divisors of @xmath3 modulo numerical equivalence .",
    "let @xmath75 be an automorphism of @xmath3 and let @xmath116 denote its induced action on @xmath115 . since @xmath115 is a finitely generated free abelian group , @xmath116 may be represented by a matrix and @xmath116 is called _ quasi - unipotent_[quasiunipot - index ] if all the eigenvalues of this matrix are roots of unity .",

    "2 .   in theorem  [ av ]",
    ", @xmath86 is also left noetherian .",
    "there are two comments that should be made about theorem  [ sigma - ample ] .",

    "however , it can happen that @xmath118 .",
    "secondly , one can still construct @xmath119 when @xmath78 is ample but @xmath116 is not quasi - unipotent , but the resulting algebra is rather unpleasant . indeed , possibly after replacing @xmath78 by some @xmath120",
    ", @xmath119 will be a non - noetherian algebra of exponential growth .",
    "see @xcite for the details .",
    "-5 mm    as we have seen , twisted homogeneous coordinate rings are fundamental to the study of noncommutative projective planes . however , a more natural starting place would be cg algebras of gelfand - kirillov dimension two since , as we suggested in the introduction , these should correspond to noncommutative curves .",
    "their structure is particularly simple .",

    "if @xmath10 is not generated in degree one , then the analogue of theorem  [ thm3.3 ] is more subtle , since more complicated algebras appear .",
    "see @xcite for the details .",
    "one should really make a further generalization by allowing @xmath10 to be prime rather than a domain and to allowing @xmath5 to be arbitrary ( since this allows one to consider the projective analogues of classical orders over dedekind domains ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm3.3 ] and corollary  [ cor3.4 ] do generalize appropriately but the results are more technical .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite .",
    "although these results are satisfying they are really only half of the story . as in the commutative case",
    "one would also like to define noncommutative curves abstractly and then show that they can indeed be described by graded rings of the appropriate form .",
    "such a result appears in @xcite but to state it we need a definition .",

    "it is easy to show that the abelian categories appearing in parts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of this theorem are of the form @xmath8 for a graded ring @xmath10 with @xmath143 , and so this result can be regarded as a partial converse to theorem  [ thm3.3 ] .",
    "a discussion of the saturation condition for noncommutative algebras may be found in @xcite .    if one accepts that noncommutative projective curves and planes have been classified , as we have argued , then the natural next step is to attempt to classify all noncommutative surfaces and this has been a major focus of recent research .",
    "this program is discussed in detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections  813 ) and so here we will be very brief .",
    "for the sake of argument we will assume that an ( irreducible ) noncommutative surface is @xmath8 for a noetherian cg domain @xmath10 with @xmath144 , although the precise definition is as yet unclear .",
    "for example , artin @xcite demands that @xmath8 should also possess a dualizing complex in the sense of yekutieli @xcite . nevertheless in attempting to classify surfaces",

    "van den bergh has created a noncommutative theory of blowing up and down @xcite and used this to answer part ( b ) in a number of special cases .",
    "a key fact in his approach is that ( after minor modifications ) each known example of a noncommutative surface @xmath8 contains an embedded commutative curve @xmath131 , just as @xmath146 in section  2 .",
    "this is important since he needs to blow up points on that subcategory . in general , define _ a point in @xmath8 _ to be @xmath147 for a point module @xmath148 .",
    "given such a point @xmath149 , write @xmath150 . mimicking the classical situation",
    "we would like to write @xmath151 and then define the blow - up of @xmath8 to be the category @xmath152 of finitely generated graded @xmath153-modules modulo those that are right bounded . however , there are two problems .",
    "a minor one is that @xmath154 needs to be twisted to take into account the shift functor on @xmath8 .",
    "the major one is that @xmath155 is only a one - sided ideal of @xmath10 , and so there is no natural multiplication on @xmath153 . to circumvent these problems ,",
    "van den bergh @xcite has to define @xmath153 in a more subtle category so that it is indeed an algebra .",

    "if @xmath78 is a coherent module over @xmath213 , we form a bimodule @xmath214 such that as a left module , @xmath215 but the right action is twisted by @xmath75 : if @xmath216 and @xmath217 , then @xmath218 is defined by the formula @xmath219 .",
    "see @xcite for a more formal discussion . now set @xmath220 and let @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the image of @xmath223 in @xmath224 .",
    "this does not define a sheaf of rings in the usual sense since we are `` playing a game of musical chairs with the open sets @xcite . ''",
    "nevertheless @xmath225 does have an natural graded algebra structure and so we can form @xmath152 in the usual way . if @xmath106 then @xmath152 is simply @xmath226 , where @xmath3 is the blow - up of @xmath190 at @xmath178 .",
    "in contrast , keeler , rogalski and the author have recently proved :      thus , @xmath230 is nothing more than the ( noncommutative ) blow - up of @xmath190 at a point ! the differences between this blow - up and van den bergh s are illustrative .",
    "van den bergh had to work hard to ensure that the analogue of the exceptional divisor really looks like a curve .",
    "indeed much of his formalism is required for just this reason . in contrast , in theorem  [ krs ] the analogue of the exceptional divisor ( which in this case equals @xmath231 ) is actually a point .",
    "this neatly explains the structure of the points in @xmath230 ; they are indeed parametrized by @xmath190 although the point corresponding to @xmath178 ( and hence the shifts of this point , which are nothing more than the points corresponding to the @xmath232 ) are distinguished .",
