    "the higgs mechanism  @xcite provides a general framework to explain the observed masses of the w and z gauge bosons through electroweak symmetry breaking . within the standard model ( sm )",
    ", this mechanism posits the existence of a scalar boson , the higgs boson , with an a priori unknown mass ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the direct searches for the sm higgs boson at the lep experiments have excluded @xmath6 gev  @xcite , while the searches at the tevatron exclude @xmath7 gev  @xcite . however , a global fit of the electroweak measurements performed at lep , sld and the tevatron experiments , predicts a sm higgs boson mass of @xmath8 gev .",
    "the sm higgs searches in atlas have been performed over a wide range of higgs boson masses ( 110 - 600 gev ) considering different sm production mechanisms ( gluon fusion , vector boson fusion and vector boson associated production ) and their subsequent decay modes .",
    "the detector resolution for the reconstructed higgs boson mass plays a crucial role in classifying the searches into numerous channels having different selection criteria as detailed below .",
    "the sm higgs boson signal events have been simulated using powheg and pythia generators , while the background contributions have been estimated either using simulation , or directly from data as appropriate .",
    "searches in these channels are focused on high mass higgs boson searches over a typical higgs mass range of 200 - 600 gev . in the zz channels",
    "the events are required to have a lepton pair ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) with reconstructed @xmath14 close to the z boson mass .",
    "the selected events for the @xmath15 @xcite search are further classified into two subcategories considering the pile - up effects ( ` low ' and ` high ' ) on the reconstructed missing transverse energies ( @xmath16 ) , while the @xmath17  @xcite search considers ` tagged ' ( 2 b - tagged jets ) and ` untagged ' ( @xmath18 b - tagged jets ) events separately .",
    "figures  [ fig : searchchannels ] ( a ) and  [ fig : searchchannels ] ( b ) show the transverse mass distribution for @xmath15 candidates in the ` low ' pile - up data , and @xmath19 distribution for @xmath17 in ` tagged ' selection respectively .",
    "the selection criteria for the @xmath20 search  @xcite are optimized over a higgs boson mass range of 300 - 600 gev considering ` h+0jet ' , ` h+1jet ' and ` h+2jets ' ( mostly from the vector boson fusion processes ) .      the search in this channel  @xcite consists of event categories with different lepton flavor combinations , while the sm @xmath22 production processes remain irreducible background at the final level of event selection",
    ". full reconstruction of the higgs boson mass is possible for this channel with excellent mass resolution ( 2% and 1.5% for 4e and 4@xmath23 at @xmath24 gev ) .",
    "the 4-lepton invariant mass ( @xmath25 ) distribution is displayed in figure  [ fig : searchchannels ] ( c ) .",
    "although @xmath27 decays have small branching ratio ( about 0.2% ) , search in this channel  @xcite has the potential to discover the higgs boson in the low mass range ( 110 - 150 gev ) .",
    "the analysis is split into nine independent sub - channels based on the photon pseudorapidity , conversion status , and the momentum component of the diphoton system transverse to the thrust axis ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the background distribution is obtained by fitting the @xmath29 distribution in data with a smoothly falling exponential function , while the atlas @xmath29 mass resolution is approximately 1.4% for @xmath30 gev .",
    "the diphoton invariant mass distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : searchchannels ] ( d ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      the searches in this channel  @xcite cover a wide range of @xmath4 gev consisting of different number of jets ( 0 , 1 and 2 jets ) and lepton flavor combinations ( ee , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) in the final states .",
    "the reconstructed ww transverse mass ( @xmath34 ) has been utilized in this analysis as a discriminating variable as shown in figure  [ fig : searchchannels](e ) for the ` h+0jet ' sub - channel .",
    "the searches in @xmath36 channels  @xcite are optimized for @xmath2 of 110 - 130 gev .",
    "the main advantage with these channels is due to the large @xmath37 at low @xmath2 , along with the possibility to fully reconstruct the higgs boson mass through @xmath38 .",
    "the final states with one or two charged leptons are sub - categorized depending on the transverse momentum of the reconstructed vector boson , and the lepton flavors .",
    "figure  [ fig : searchchannels ] ( f ) shows the @xmath38 distribution for the @xmath39 sub - channel .",
    "@xmath43 searches  @xcite consist of all possible leptonic and hadronic ( @xmath44 ) decay modes of the @xmath45-leptons originating from the higgs boson decay . for the @xmath46 and @xmath47 channels , invariant mass of the @xmath48 system",
    "is reconstructed assuming collinear approximation .",
    "the searches in @xmath49 channel reconstruct the @xmath50 using the missing mass calculator techniques  @xcite where the full event topology is reconstructed using the kinematics of the @xmath45-lepton decay products .",
    "the results from the aforesaid search channels have been utilized to set an upper limit on the sm higgs boson production cross section as a function of the @xmath2 .",
    "the limits are conveniently expressed in terms of the signal strength ( @xmath51 ) , the ratio of a given higgs boson production cross section ( @xmath52 ) to its sm predicted value ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the @xmath54 prescription@xcite with a profile likelihood ratio test statistic , @xmath55  @xcite has been utilized here to derive the exclusion limits .",
    "figure  [ fig : combination ] shows the exclusion limits on @xmath23 at 95% confidence level ( cl ) for individual search channels , along with the combined ones from all search channels over the @xmath2 range of 110 - 150 gev .",
    "a small excess of events near @xmath3 gev is observed in @xmath26 and @xmath21 search channels , both of which fully reconstruct the higgs boson mass with high resolution .",

    "atlas has performed extensive searches for the sm higgs boson utilizing the full 4.7 - 4.9 @xmath0 dataset recorded during the 2011 lhc operations .",
    "the atlas combination  @xcite from numerous search channels excludes the sm higgs boson mass in ranges of 110.0 - 117.5 gev , 118.5 - 122.5 gev , and 129 - 539 gev at the 95% cl , while an exclusion of 120 gev@xmath56555 gev is expected in the absence of higgs signal .",
    "furthermore , the exclusion limits have been recalculated at 99% cl and the sm higgs boson over a mass range of 130 - 486 gev has been excluded .",
    "the excess in the observed data has a local significance of 2.5@xmath57 , where the expected significance in the presence of a sm higgs boson with @xmath58 gev is 2.9@xmath52 .",
    "the global probability for such an excess to occur across the entire sm higgs mass range ( 110 - 600 gev ) is estimated to be 30% .",
    "however , the said probability reduces to nearly 10% if a 110 - 146 gev mass range for the sm higgs boson is considered .",
