    "one of the main goals of quantum theory formalism is a description of time evolution of quantum systems .",
    "usually the evolution is regarded as a two step procedure which includes reversible , unitary evolution and irreversible `` measurement '' handled by the so called projection or reduction postulate .",
    "there are some models which come across attempts to unify both , qualitatively different steps as for example @xcite .",
    "however some of the major questions are not satisfactory solved so far .",
    "the main directions of the investigations are related to a few major modifications and interpretations of quantum theory like consistent histories approaches @xcite , modal interpretations @xcite , quantum jumps and collapse ideas @xcite and different types of models based on stochastic equations @xcite .",
    "the measurement process is treated differently depending on interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "there is no place here to discuss all the possible interpretations .",
    "a good , but because of very dynamic development of the field , not quite up - to - date review can be found in @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "the fundamental part of description of measurement seems to be the projection postulate which , from the orthodox point of view , determines the state of the system just after measurement .",
    "however , this procedure leads to inconsistencies with the schrdinger equation .",
    "in other words , the usual description of a process of quantum time evolution requires a coexistence of two different evolution mechanisms .",
    "this leads to additional problems like the time duration and dynamics of the `` wave function collapse '' @xcite , a general problem of physical reality before and after measurement @xcite and non  local  like behavior in case of spatially separated quantum subsystems @xcite .",
    "this short introduction is , of course , far from being complete , but we can conclude that the problems mentioned above are still opened and their explanation requires probably fundamental changes of the evolution postulates of quantum theory .",
    "the goal of this paper is to propose an alternative model of quantum evolution . in the following , we work in a nearly standard framework of quantum mechanics replacing only the unitary time evolution and projection postulate by a projection evolution ( _ pev _  )",
    "it means that _ we reject the schrdinger equation _ as the fundamental equation of motion .",
    "it can be recovered as a special case of the projection evolution .",
    "the proposed evolution procedure unites both the unitary evolution and the process of measurement . within this idea",
    "the evolution is only a sequence of some projections made randomly by nature , and with a system dependent probability distribution .",
    "the sequence of projections is dependent on structure of the physical system under consideration .",
    "the procedure can be extended to a povm scheme @xcite , as well .",
    "the main difference among our proposal and other major models is that the _ pev _  formalism allows to treat time on equal footing with the spatial variables .",
    "time is not a parameter but a dynamical variable_. this feature makes the model hardly comparable with the ones in which the physical time is the evolution parameter .",
    "nevertheless , some aspects of the _ pev _  idea are similar to well known models . in this sense , this idea lies somewhere between the decoherent histories approach @xcite and some modal interpretations ( see pp . :",
    "108 , 179 , 199 , 253 in ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the decoherent histories approach the paths of evolution are determined partially by a family of decompositions of unity .",
    "on the other hand , the preferred basis can define such decomposition in the modal theories .",
    "these decompositions of unity describe the physical , basic properties of quantum systems and play a role the evolution operator within the _ pev _  approach .",
    "one can also find some formal similarities of the projection evolution to the analysis of the quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the basic mechanism we propose does not lead to a sequence of subsequent measurements only , but to random choices of the next states of the system , where the probability distribution is a function dependent on previous states of the system .",
    "the idea of the _ pev _  can be treated as a special case of more general concept :    1 .",
    "the states of a quantum system are described by either density operators or the appropriate functionals , and the term `` quantum evolution '' is understood as a sequence of state changes ordered by the the nature .",
    "+ this idea requires introducing of an ordering parameter which orders the subsequent changes of the state of a physical system .",
    "this parameter , denoted by @xmath0 will be called the evolution parameter .",
    "+ the above statements requires additional explanations .",
    "usually changes are related to the time parameter . in general , in our approach , there is no direct relation between both , the time and state changes .",
    "we suggest that the natural change of the state of a physical is the primitive notion .",
    "the space and time are the additional structures of our universe .",
    "they are dynamical variables in the theory .",
    "+ the standard non  relativistic quantum mechanics can be considered as approximation in which both the evolution parameter and the physical time are in one  to ",
    "one correspondence . in this case , the time is not a dynamical * variable * , but a parameter which can be identified with the evolution parameter of the _ pev _  .",
    "+ both , the evolution parameter and the physical time can be approximately related one to another for the physical systems described by the states which are strongly localized in the time variable .",
    "this can explain the successes of the traditional approach but it leads also to some well known paradoxes .",
    "we will consider this type of quantum systems in the the section containing a few examples .",
    "+ many problems like time  energy uncertainty principle , time of arrival , life ",
    "time problems , the young type experiments for time  slits @xcite and similar phenomena suggest that the physical time should be the dynamical variable not a parameter .",
    "it is much more natural assumption .",
    "+ in addition , the relativistic quantum mechanics , in fact , requires that both notions the evolution parameter and the time variable should be different .",
    "note , that mixing of the space and time coordinates by the lorentz transformations results in the undetermined status of transformed coordinates .",
    "they are neither parameters nor variables . the same one can say even about galilean transformations .",
    "+ we claim that the physical time should be treated on the same footing as the other spatial coordinates .",
    "it should be also the dynamical variable which spans the additional dimension in the physical space .",
    "the physical states should determine localization of the system in space and time according to quantum rules .",
    "+ we suppose that the evolution parameter @xmath0 is a common parameter for the whole universe . in this sense",
    "it parameterizes a kind of the `` internal clock '' of the universe . because @xmath0 is the parameter it can not be affected by physical interactions ( the physical time can ! ) + for simplicity we assume that @xmath0 is a real number parameter .",
    "2 .   there exists a world lottery mechanism ( chooser ) which chooses randomly the next state of quantum system in a way dependent on physical structure of this quantum system .",
    "+ the realization of the chooser is based on the so called selected collapse projection postulate ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our chooser is not driven by the random noise but it is a kind of the _ quantum state dependent world lottery_. + the evolution parameter @xmath0 is an internal parameter of the `` world lottery '' mechanism . for every @xmath0 the nature draws lots to get next state of the universe .",
    "+ it means , that the projection evolution ( _ pev _  ) can be considered as a stochastic process ( in respect to @xmath0 , instead of time ) determining , at each step of evolution , a physical state of the system represented by a density operator @xmath1 .",
    "the probability distribution for the chooser is determined , in some way , by the previous states of the quantum system .",
    "the evolutions of a larger quantum system and its subsystems have to be consistent .",
    "+ because we assume that the evolution parameter @xmath0 is common for our universe , the universe itself changes states as a whole .",
    "it means that the effective evolution for a given subsystem should be induced by the global evolution .",
    "+ the description of the global evolution ( for the whole universe ) is in practice not available , and in fact , we are able to write down only evolution operators for larger or smaller subsystems .",
    "these effective operators have to satisfy some scaling conditions . in the next section a proposal for scaling condition",
    "is discussed .",
    "however , this is still open problem .    because we expect that such fundamental mechanism as evolution of quantum system should be a rather simple physical law , consistent with known results of quantum mechanics , we propose a rather natural realization of this idea in the next paragraph .",
    "the approach is _ observer  free_. we do not need neither to split the physical world into _ observer and the physical objects _ which have to be observed nor _ to introduce a mind _ , which allows to choose the state after observation , as is required in some approaches ( collapse of states is the most natural process in the _ pev _  ) .",
    "the _ pev _  do not require also _ splitting of the universe into classical and quantum worlds_.    we do not need also any strange assumptions about _ our `` knowledge in which way '' _",
    "e.g. , the particle passes through the slits .",
    "these results are a consequence of a single principle postulated within the _ pev _  approach .",
    "let us consider a quantum system described by states represented by the quantum density operators @xmath1 . in the following by @xmath0",
    "we denote the evolution parameter which orders the evolution of the universe .",
    "in addition , for each @xmath0 we define a family of projectors which gives an orthogonal resolution of unity i.e. ,  roughly speaking , for each @xmath0 they fulfill the following conditions : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the unit operator .",
    "+ the operators @xmath4 should represent the essential constraints of the physical system , responsible for its time evolution .",
    "the hamiltonian plays the same role in traditional approach . in this sense",
    ", they play a role of the evolution operators because they force changes of the physical system which they describe .",
    "the indices @xmath5 represent here the sets of quantum numbers labelling the projection operators ( [ resunit ] ) , uniquely .    instead of",
    "usual unitary evolution we postulate that the new state @xmath6 of the physical system , at the evolution parameter @xmath0 , is created from the previous state @xmath7 by _ randomly chosen , projection _",
    "we will show a few examples how to construct such families of projectors , in next section .",
    "the projectors @xmath4 are chosen randomly according to the following probability distribution : @xmath8 , \\label{(!e!2 ) } \\ ] ] where @xmath5 runs over the sets of quantum numbers describing the system at the evolution parameter @xmath0 and @xmath9 is the set of quantum numbers which describes the previous state .",
    "it means , that the nature applies the projection postulate to get a new state from the previous one : @xmath10}. \\label{quant.3 } \\ ] ] to simplify our notation let us imagine that the projections @xmath4 are constant functions of the evolution parameter on the intervals @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . using this notation the idea of _",
    "pev _  leads to the following recurrence equation for states of the system under consideration : @xmath13}. \\label{(!e!3 ) } \\ ] ] in other words , the equation ( [ quant.3 ] ) describes the following mechanism : having the state of a physical system given by @xmath14 at the evolution parameter @xmath15 , the next state at @xmath16 is chosen randomly , with the probability distribution ( [ ( !",
    "e!2 ) ] ) , from all possible states ( [ ( !",
    "e!3 ) ] ) , where @xmath17 runs over the whole range required by ( [ resunit ] ) .    the applied projection postulate is in the form of the so  called `` selective collapse '' @xcite . an important feature of the formula ( [ ( !",
    "e!2 ) ] ) is a conservation of `` purity '' of states .",
    "if the previous state is pure , the next one is also a pure state .",
    "this allows to omit the problem of `` ensemble of worlds '' as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that in this approach we do not need any `` environment '' ; the same procedure should be applied for microscopic and macroscopic systems with appropriate projection evolution operators , related by the scaling condition mentioned in the introduction and which can be postulated as follows : having a density operator @xmath18 for larger system @xmath19 , it is commonly assumed that the density operator @xmath20 of the subsystem @xmath21 can be obtained by partial trace over the residual subsystem @xmath22 i.e. , @xmath23 . to have consistent description both @xmath19 and @xmath24 one needs to fulfill the following obvious condition ( scaling property ) : @xmath25 } = \\frac{{\\mathsf{e}\\kern-1pt\\llap{$\\vert$}(a,\\tau;\\mu)}\\rho_a(\\tau - d\\tau ) { \\mathsf{e}\\kern-1pt\\llap{$\\vert$}(a,\\tau;\\mu ) } } { { \\textrm{tr}}_a[{\\mathsf{e}\\kern-1pt\\llap{$\\vert$}(a,\\tau;\\mu)}\\rho_a(\\tau - d\\tau){\\mathsf{e}\\kern-1pt\\llap{$\\vert$}(a,\\tau;\\mu ) } ] } , \\label{(!e!3a ) } \\ ] ] where @xmath26 are required effective _ pev _",
    "operators for the subsystem @xmath24 with the appropriate sets of quantum numbers @xmath27 corresponding , in some way , to the quantum numbers @xmath5 of the larger system @xmath19 .",
    "it means that drawing of lots required by the _ pev _",
    "approach should be correlated within the connected parts of the universe .    in principle , having the state @xmath18 and @xmath28 for the universe the condition ( [ ( !",
    "e!3a ) ] ) should allow obtaining the appropriate states and the _ pev _  operators for required subsystems .",
    "till now , we have no proof for uniqueness of solutions of the equations ( [ ( !",
    "e!3a ) ] ) in respect to @xmath26 .    the general equation ( [ ( ! e!3 ) ] ) suggests that the process of evolution can follow various paths @xmath29 considered as the series of projections chosen randomly at the evolution parameters @xmath30",
    ". then one can ask about the conditional probability of choosing of the state @xmath14 under condition , that the previous states chosen by the nature are described by @xmath31 .    at this point",
    ", one needs to observe that the _ pev _  generates a set of `` quantum histories '' consisted of products of projection operators similar to those in @xcite .",
    "however , the histories are ordered in respect to the evolution parameter , not by the physical time . in this case",
    "there is no algebra of histories because the only available `` histories '' are those defined by the _",
    "operator which does not allow for logical operations on the evolution paths .",
    "for example , in notation of @xcite , the negation of the * compound * `` history '' like @xmath32 has no meaning in _ pev _  , because _ pev _  represents a step by step stochastic process and @xmath33 can not be ordered by the evolution parameter . the same one can say about the other logical operations on the paths .    according to the _ pev _",
    "idea , the main physical interest is not in the products of projections only , but also in series of states which they produce .",
    "more precisely , the system is fully described at the evolution parameter @xmath0 if we have the state and the last projection operator responsible for generating this state from the previous one  a kind of history of the system is a sequence of pairs of quantum states and the appropriate projections .",
    "the probability of finding a given path of evolution at the evolution parameter @xmath0 can be calculated using equations ( [ ( !",
    "e!3 ) ] ) and ( [ ( !",
    "e!2 ) ] ) and can be written as : @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{(!e!4 ) } \\ ] ] in this way we have defined the evolution of quantum systems as a kind of a stochastic game played by nature .",
    "this game is not parameterized by the physical time but the evolution parameter .",
    "within this idea we treat this game as a fundamental process  a law of nature .",
    "in this section we show three simple examples of description in terms of the projection evolution .",
    "the most important seems to be a reproducing of the schrdinger  like evolution .",
    "it is the purpose of the next subsection in which we show how to derive the schrdinger evolution using a rather general method of generating operator .",
    "the other examples concern a toy model of mach - zehnder interferometer and the evolution of a particle passing through the device .",
    "let us introduce a set of mutually commuting hermitian operators @xmath35 which describes the essential properties of the system within the space  time and other degrees of freedom .",
    "it is important to notice that , due to the spectral theorem , there exists a common decomposition of unity for all the operators @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "this resolution of unity should give the _ pev _",
    "the operators @xmath38 will be called the evolution generating operators .",
    "let us consider the 3d harmonic oscillator , but in the non ",
    "relativistic space  time . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the single particle state space ( without spin ) @xmath39 in the four dimensional real space @xmath40 .",
    "the scalar product in @xmath41 is defined as : @xmath42 and it contains the integration over the time .",
    "it means that the time is dynamical variable .",
    "now we define the evolution generating operators as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the usual harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , @xmath45 is the square of the angular momentum operator and @xmath46 denotes the third component of the angular momentum operator .",
    "all the operators @xmath47 , @xmath48 are hermitian and they are the subject of the spectral theorem . the first operator @xmath49 has the continuous spectrum , the second one and the third have the discrete spectrum .",
    "it allows to write the common spectral measure as a product of spectral measures of these three operators : @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the spectral measure for @xmath49 , @xmath52 , the decomposition of unity for @xmath45 operator and @xmath53 the corresponding decomposition of unity for @xmath46 .",
    "the suggested evolution operator should be of the following form : @xmath54 and , in fact , it is independent of evolution parameter @xmath0 .",
    "as usually , there are known difficulties for the continuous spectrum case .",
    "these problems can be solved in many ways e.g. , by making use of the smeared out operators method @xcite .",
    "the projection evolution operator ( [ projevho ] ) leads to the evolution ",
    "parameter independent evolution . in this case",
    ", the first random choice decides about the state of the system which do not evolve further with increasing @xmath0 . for every @xmath0 the state chosen by the nature is of the following form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 are numerical coefficients .",
    "the vectors @xmath57 are the common eigenvectors of the three operators : the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 with the eigenvalues @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the `` only '' difference between the standard approach and _ pev _  is that the functions ( [ gener : eq.4 ] ) are functions of time , where time is a dynamical variable .",
    "it means that such states are not localized in time .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the vectors ( [ gener : eq.4 ] ) can be normalized to the dirac  delta distribution .",
    "however , in reality one can expect the states in the form of wave packets : @xmath61 for example , the measurement of position in time ( it is a special kind of interaction within the space  time ) leads , by definition , to the localization in time . for @xmath62",
    "the states ( [ wavepackt ] ) are `` perfectly '' localized in time @xmath63 : @xmath64 the states ( [ lwavepackt ] ) correspond exactly to the traditional schrdinger type solutions for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "however , one needs to realize that within the _ pev _  these solutions represent the states which are localized in the fixed time @xmath63 .",
    "it means , that one needs to have some additional interactions to `` shift '' these states in time .",
    "this is what we are doing in the traditional unitary evolution approach . within the standard quantum mechanics one assumes implicitly , that there exists a `` time machine '' which evolves the state perfectly localized in time to later moments",
    "this mechanics describes the state vectors projected onto the subsequent moments of time loosing possible non  local time correlations .    on the other hand",
    ", the state ( [ wavepackt ] ) describes a full time behavior of the system as a single vector which allows to calculate typical statistical characteristics like averages , variations and other statistical moments .",
    "for example , the average time position of the harmonic oscillator described by the wave packets of the form @xmath65 can be obtained in the usual way by the integration : @xmath66 obviously , this example can be generalized to any arbitrary system which one can describe in the traditional way .      in this paragraph",
    "we consider a very simplified mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the aim of the considerations is to show the temporal behavior of the interferometer in two models .",
    "the first model does not correspond to the schrdinger type motion because the beam splitters localize the particle .",
    "the second model is based on more traditional thinking about the beam splitters as some unitary devices . in both cases",
    "we get the similar results which differs mainly in temporal part of the description .",
    "the main disadvantage of both models is that they do not show , in general possible , spreading in time of states of the system .",
    "because of this , within these toy models , the time of arrival of a particle to the detector is a sharp number , without random distribution",
    ". however , this type of models can be analyzed on the elementary level and they are able to show some interesting features of the formalism .    the mach - zehnder interferometer shown in [ fig1 ] allows to show the quantum interference .",
    "the particles are produced in the source _ z_. the first beam splitter @xmath67 splits an incoming beam into two separate channels .",
    "next , there is a phase shifter",
    "_ ps _  and the second beam splitter @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the detectors which detect the particle in the first or the second output channel .",
    "however , for our purpose we consider a simplified version of the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "it is shown in the figure [ fig2 ]        it is able to simulate , to some extend , the mach  zehnder interferometer shown in the figure [ fig1 ] for example , it happens for the @xmath71spin particles or even polarized photons .    in the following we are using the toy model ( like in sect .",
    "2.5 of @xcite ) in which the space is discrete .",
    "however , in our approach the time is also a dynamical variable and we have to use not one  dimensional space but two  dimensional space ",
    "time for which both the time @xmath72 and the coordinate @xmath73 takes on only a finite numbers of integer values : @xmath74 like in @xcite we assume the `` periodic boundary conditions '' for both the time and the space coordinates , so that last sites for @xmath72 and @xmath73 are adjacent to the first sites . in this way ,",
    "our space ",
    "time * x*=@xmath75 is the cartesian product of two discrete `` circles '' .",
    "first one representing the time t consists of @xmath76 points and the second one x contains @xmath77 space coordinate points , respectively . in addition , we assume an extra two  valued variable @xmath78 which determines two possible channels in which each space  time point can be located ( see ch .",
    "12 of @xcite ) .",
    "the space @xmath79 of quantum states consists of complex functions : @xmath80 the scalar product in the state space @xmath79 is : @xmath81 again , it is very important to keep in mind , that time is not a parameter but a dynamical variable .",
    "it does not enumerate the subsequent events and does nt describe the evolution of the system in this sense .",
    "more , it is even possible that two subsequent , ordered by the evolution parameter @xmath0 , events occur in the inverse order in time . in this way we can have so called backward causation required for quantum world by some authors @xcite .    to construct the projection evolution operator we have to analyze the physical structure ( in required approximation ) of devices shown in the [ fig2 ] .",
    "let us assume that the source _ z _ produces the particles localized in both the time @xmath72 and the position @xmath82 i.e. , in the states @xmath83 which are defined as the `` eigenfunctions '' of time , position and channel operators . other words , the states @xmath84 represent the functions localizing the particle in point @xmath85 of the space  time and in the channel @xmath86 : @xmath87 note that @xmath88 and @xmath89 are here the quantum numbers but @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote the corresponding variables .",
    "starting from the source , the particle is created in one of the possible states @xmath92 i.e. , at a randomly chosen time @xmath72 , at fixed place @xmath82 and in the @xmath93 channel .",
    "there are also possible other , less interesting processes which are represented here by a set of projection operators denoted by @xmath94 ( other processes ) .",
    "together with the creation of particle they complete a resolution of unity . at this moment",
    "we do not need to analyze them more carefully .",
    "the assumptions allow to write the following projection evolution operator for the source : @xmath95 note that the operator is independent of @xmath0 .    as the next step",
    "we have to construct the toy model of free evolution .",
    "this type of evolution is required to describe behavior of the particle outside of devices i.e. , in the free space  time .    in our toy model ( i )",
    "we assume the free evolution of projective type but which resembles the schrdinger s type of evolution .",
    "for this purpose we define the unitary transformation @xmath96 ( see the toy models in @xcite ) : @xmath97 where the ket @xmath98 represents the function @xmath99 , see ( [ locfun ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath100 is the unitary operator within the space spanned by the kets @xmath98 i.e. , spanned by the functions @xmath99 .",
    "the last property allows to define the set of vectors which allow to define the schrdinger s type of evolution .",
    "these vectors will be denoted by : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the local ( it is a function of time ! ) unitary operator in ( [ stransform ] ) .",
    "we assume that the set of functions @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is an integer , give an orthonormal basis in the space of all functions dependent only on time : @xmath105 the functions @xmath103 determine the main part of the amplitude describing the fact that the particle can be localized in time ( see remarks below the eq .",
    "( [ prpsi ] ) ) .",
    "it implies that the functions @xmath106 form an orthonormal basis in the space of states @xmath79 .",
    "because these vectors are independent of the evolution parameter , the projection evolution operator for free evolution can be considered as a single random choice ( like in the first example ) : @xmath107 observation : the action of the operator ( [ pevfree ] ) on a vector state @xmath108 gives a schrdinger ",
    "type function : @xmath109 the nature chooses by chance ( with the distribution determined by the last state ) the actual state labelled by @xmath5 , which characterizes mainly the potential localization of the particle in the physical time . in this model , time and space positions are treated on the same footing .",
    "it means that there are possible situation when particle can not be found in some regions of time .",
    "however , this situation can not be interpreted in the usual way that such particle does not exist .",

    "taking into account that times of emissions @xmath174 of particles , in principle , are also random variables , the probability that a particle being in the initial state @xmath186 , can be localized at a given time in @xmath113 is the product of @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
