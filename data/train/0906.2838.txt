    "density of excited levels @xmath4 and emission probability @xmath5 of any nuclear reaction product following neutron resonance @xmath6 decay are the main sources of experimental information on properties of nuclear matter and practically important nuclear - physics constants .",
    "this stipulates for necessity of their determination with maximum possible accuracy .",
    "however , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 values can not be determined for main mass of nuclei excited in @xmath7 reaction in direct experiments : mean spacing @xmath8 between levels is comparable with or much less than a resolution ( fwhm ) of existing spectrometers .",
    "correspondingly , these parameters can be extracted only from the spectra measured with  bad \" resolution .",
    "only one - step reactions were mainly used for this aim .",
    "obtaining of information on @xmath4 and @xmath5 from gamma - spectra of two - step reaction was started only in the last time @xcite .",
    "comparison of shape of functional dependence of the obtained in this way values of @xmath9 and radiative strength functions @xmath10 with the data of one - step reactions ( spectra of evaporated nucleons , different gamma - spectra ) points to their principle incompatibility .",
    "it appears itself in presence @xcite or lack of abrupt changes in determined parameters .",
    "this operation allows one to determine sources of systematical errors , estimate their values and reveal the region of maximum discrepancy between the data of different experiments .",
    "analysis of the most sufficient sources of systematical errors @xcite and their transfer coefficients onto errors of parameters in practically realized case of two - step reaction ( two simultaneously emitted gamma - quanta ) showed that even maximum possible errors of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 values ( obtained from two - step reaction ) can not explain discrepancy for one- and two - step reactions .",
    "nevertheless , necessity of additional testing a method for determination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 from two - step reactions calls no doubts . at present",
    ", such test can be performed only in model - less analysis of the primary gamma - transition intensities from reaction @xmath11 ( capture in  averaged \"  resonances ) .",
    "possibility to obtain new information from these data is caused by the use by authors of experiments of unnecessary for analysis ideas of  statistical \"   mechanism of gamma - decay process and abstract form of distribution law of arbitrary gamma - transition intensity deviation in individual resonance from mean value .",
    "the shape of approximating function and concrete results of analysis of rather limited set of strongly fluctuating data are given in @xcite .",
    "more general variant of analysis is described in @xcite .",
    "in the isotopes under consideration @xmath3gd were measured the primary transition intensities following resonance neutron capture with mean energies of 2 and 24 kev ; there are also data for @xmath12gd for both capture of neutrons in resolved resonances and on beam with cadmium filter .",
    "experimental data cover maximum level excitation energy diapason for even - odd deformed nuclei and allow one to get maximum possible and completely independent information on the desired gamma - decay parameters .    in two last cases s -",
    "neutrons are mainly captured , but capture of p - neutrons must be taken into account at @xmath13=2 and 24 kev . according to @xcite , ratio between available in that time values of strength functions of s- and p - neutrons does not exceed 0.08 for @xmath14=2 , but is grater than 1 for 24 kev .",
    "therefore , the following analysis should account for excitation of resonances with spins 1/2 , 3/2 and different parity only for the data @xmath13=24 kev .",
    "this means that the averaged intensity of the primary dipole gamma - transitions to levels 5/2 depends on ratio between strength functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and that it must be varied at determination @xcite of distribution parameters of the random intensity deviations from mean value . in principle , level density with spin 5/2 in deformed nuclei must be bigger than corresponding sum for spins 1/2 , 3/2 ( as it approximately follows from known functional dependences @xmath17 ) . in case of lower neutron energy ,",
    "there was adopted hypothesis of equal intensity of primary gamma - transitions with near energy and the same multipolarity to levels with spins 1/2 , 3/2 .",
    "this assumption can be mistaken for strongly differing structure of wave functions of excited levels with different spin . according to modern microscopic nuclear models , amplitude of gamma - transition",
    "is determined by a set of quasiparticle and phonon components .",
    "their contribution depends on wave functions of both decaying and excited levels ( simplified expression for matrix element of gamma - transition in even - odd nucleus is given for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "examples of random intensity distributions in integral form for their different @xmath18 values in given level excitation energy interval , ratios @xmath19 of strength functions of e1- and m1-transitions , dispersions of distributions @xmath20 and registration threshold of peak in spectrum are given in @xcite for the case of excitation of resonances with the only spin value .",
    "introduction of additional parameter ( ratio between mean intensities of primary gamma - transitions to levels 5/2 and corresponding data for levels 1/2 , 3/2 ) in the case of resonance with two spin values weekly influences stability of approximation and sensitivity of this process to variation of initial values of fitted parameters .",
    "this result was tested for the case when mean intensities in two different groups differed , practically , by a factor 2 .",
    "experimental cumulative sums of relative intensities @xmath21 are presented in figs .",
    "1,2 together with their best approximations .",
    "as an example , there are used the data for @xmath22 kev . due to negligible contribution of p - neutron capture",
    ", approximation takes into account only two distributions  e1- and m1-transitions following decay of resonances with spins 1/2 .",
    "experimental distributions for @xmath23 kev are superposition of four distributions  two distributions mentioned above and one more pair corresponding to gamma - transitions between resonances with @xmath24=3/2 and final levels with @xmath24=5/2 .",

    "this allows one not to account for possibility of considerable ( for example , more than 10 - 20% ) uncertainty in determined level density caused by chosen conditions of approximation ( excluded inequality of level densities with different parity ) .",

    "the porter - thomas distribution allows very significant random partial widths .",
    "but fluctuations of the measured gamma - transition intensities @xmath45 are always limited in their maximum value by positive correlation between partial and total radiative widths of decaying level .",

    "intensities in the performed analysis were normalized so that their maximum value did not exceed @xmath48 of approximation region for the majority of data sets .",
    "the main error of analysis can be related only to  loss \"  of gamma - transitions whose intensities do not exceed threshold value and/or mistaken identification of quanta ordering in gamma - cascades .",
    "probability of overlap of two peaks corresponding to near - lying levels was estimated in @xcite .",
    "as it follows from the data presented by authors , this effect is small enough and , most probably , can not explain significant ( several times ) discrepancy between level density determined by us and its prediction in the frameworks of the fermi - gas model .",
    "moreover , this overlapping in the chosen presentation of experimental data increases rate of growth of cumulative sums and , most probably , overestimates the @xmath18 value obtained .",
    "there could be essential uncertainty caused by even and considerable loss of some part of observed peaks corresponding to intense primary transitions due to groping of levels in near - lying ( spacing of about 1 - 2 kev ) multiplets .",
    "but this possibility is not predicted by modern nuclear theory .",
    "experimental data of nuclear spectroscopy also do not point to existence of numerous multiplets of neighboring levels with spins 1/2 and 3/2 in even - odd compound nuclei .",
    "it is also possible that the gamma - transitions in the all or greater part of chosen intervals of of primary transition intensities ( with the width of some hundreds kev ) have different mean values .",
    "moreover , probability of relatively low - intensity gamma - transitions quickly ( but smoothly ) increases as decreasing their intensity . in principle , this effect can be caused by mechanism of fragmentation @xcite of different states over neighboring levels of a nucleus .",
    "apparently , only this hypothesis can be alternative explanation of  step - like \"   structure in level density in performed here analysis .",
    "this hypothesis can be applied to the determined according to @xcite level densities under the following conditions : main part of levels ( with the same @xmath49 ) below @xmath50 must not be excited by primary gamma - transitions ; some cooper pairs of nucleons must break simultaneously at small as compared with @xmath51 nuclear excitation energy .",
    "one can not suggest other possibility for precise calculation of the two - step gamma - cascade intensities in the investigated even - odd nuclei .      the most important physics information on structure of excited levels below @xmath52 can be derived from coefficient of collective enhancement of level density @xmath53 :    @xmath54    in accordance with modern notions",
    ", @xmath53 determines @xcite degree of increase in density of pure quasiparticle excitations @xmath55 in deformed nucleus due to its vibrations and rotation .",
    "one can accept in the first approach that , to a precision of small constant , it equals coefficient of vibrational enhancement of level density @xmath56 .    on the whole",
    ", this coefficient is determined by change in entropy @xmath57 of a nucleus and redistribution of nuclear excitation energy @xmath58 between quasiparticles and phonons at nuclear temperature @xmath59 :    @xmath60    now there is a possibility for unambiguous experimental determination @xcite of breaking threshold @xmath61 for the first and following cooper pairs , value and shape of correlation functions @xmath62 of nucleon pair number @xmath63 in heated nuclei .",
    "the main uncertainty of @xmath61 is caused by the lack of experimental data on function @xmath64 , the secondary - by uncertainty of one - quasiparticle level density @xmath65 in model @xcite .",
    "so , three different model dependent approximations of level density in large set of nuclei ( @xcite and @xcite ) predict threshold @xmath66 for five - quasiparticle excitations which differs by a factor of 1.5 - 2.0 .    in practice",
    ", we used the second variant of notions of the cooper pair correlation function in heated nucleus @xcite for estimation of the @xmath56 value from approximation of the data @xcite .",
    "the values @xmath67 mev , @xmath68 mev@xmath69 were used in calculation .",
    "densities of three - quasiparticle levels ( multiplied by the  best \"   @xmath70 value ) calculated for the breaking threshold of the first cooper pair of nucleons @xmath71 mev are given in fig .",
    "its concrete values for minimal @xmath42 are equal to 9.6 and 6.3 for @xmath26gd and @xmath12gd , respectively .",
    "the assumption on energy independence of @xmath56 at low excitation energy is evidently unreal ( see fig .",
    "* fig .  7 .",
    "* points show coefficient of collective enhancement of level density , curve represents the values of parameter @xmath72 used in @xcite for calculation of partial density of three - quasiparticle levels .",

    "is observed considerable correlation of this coefficient with the @xmath72 value from @xcite and from the second variant of analysis @xcite .",
    "decrease in correlation at higher excitation energy can be related to significant contribution of five - quasiparticle excitations in function @xmath55 and/or to smaller than it is adopted in @xcite rate of decrease of function @xmath72 at @xmath74 mev .",
    "analysis of experimental data presented above in common with the data @xcite points to necessity of experimental search for neutron resonance structure in the energy interval @xmath13 of about 1 - 2 mev and more .",
    "figure 6 show both general properties of radiative strength functions in isotopes under consideration and their evident difference in region below @xmath50 .",
    "analogous variations of energy dependence of radiative strength functions in both nuclei of neighboring elements and isotopes are also demonstrated by analysis of the two - step cascade intensities . if these changes are completely or to a great extent determined by difference in ratio between qusiparticle and phonon components of the neutron resonance wave functions then extrapolation of the regularity established in @xcite for expected difference of breaking threshold of two neighboring cooper pairs @xmath75 can be spread and into the region above @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , one can expect cyclic change in structure of excited resonances with period of about 2 mev for heavy nuclei with @xmath76 mev .",
    "moreover , this effect in even - odd isotopes of rear earth elements can appear itself as change in ratio between intensities of the primary transitions with energy @xmath77 mev and @xmath78 mev .",
    "the data presented allow the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "nuclei @xmath3gd , excited in the @xmath11 reaction by the 2 kev and 24 kev neutrons demonstrate the same properties as those revealed earlier for about forty nuclei from the mass region @xmath79 : step - wise structure in level density and local strengthening of radiative strength functions of the primary gamma - transitions to the levels of this structure .",
    "abrupt change in structure of levels in the excitation energy region about 1.0 - 1.5 mev .",
    "it manifests itself in considerable increase of the @xmath19 values and in strong difference between their distribution and normal distribution of random gamma - transition amplitudes .",
    "these experimental ratios @xmath19 can be used for obtaining of simpler values of the e1- and m1-transition strength functions and data on the ratio between density of levels with different parity in the frameworks of methods @xcite .",
    "main part of the primary gamma - transitions observed in the @xmath11 reaction corresponds , probably , to excitation of levels with large and weakly fragmented phonon components of wave functions .",
    "the data on the most probable @xmath18 values obtained for different intervals of neutron energy allow one to consider practically negligible dependence of the determined level density on @xmath13 .",
    "besides , influence of nuclear resonance structures results in considerable change in shape of the deviation distribution of the gamma - transition intensities from its mean value even in the narrow interval of nuclear excitation energy considered here .",
    "analysis of the available data on the primary gamma - transition intensities from @xmath11 reaction in compound nuclei @xmath3gd showed step - like structure in density of their levels and increase in radiative strength function of transitions to levels in region of this structure , at least , for primary dipole gamma - transitions . i d est , it confirmed main conclusions of @xcite and pointed to necessity to reveal and remove systematical experimental errors in alternative methods for determination of only level density @xcite and simultaneous determination of all the parameters of cascade gamma - decay @xcite .",
    "the most important problems at experimental determination of level density and emission probability of reaction product become both correct accounting for influence of level structure on emission probability of nuclear evaporation and cascade gamma - quanta in investigations of nuclear reactions on accelerator beams and considerable decrease in systematical errors of experiment .",
    "the best estimations of dispersion ( parameter @xmath30 ) of the random intensity fluctuations strongly differ from the mean values predicted in @xcite ) .",
    "this allows one to assume that the wave functions of levels excited by primary transitions contain considerable components of weakly fragmented nuclear states which are more complicated than one- or three - quasiparticle states .",
    "approximation of the obtained level density by model @xcite confirms the fact of considerable ( @xmath80 10 times ) increase of level density due to excitations of mainly vibration type @xcite .",
    "comparison of the data presented in figs .",
    "5,6 with those obtained from intensities of two - step cascades permits one to make preliminary conclusion that the abrupt change in structure of decaying neutron resonances , at least , in their energy interval @xmath80 24 kev is not observed .",
    "there is no reason to wait principle change in the determined according to method @xcite level density and energy dependence of the primary transition radiative strength functions from resonance to resonance .",
    "further decrease of errors of these nuclear parameters determined from intensities of the two - step gamma - cascades undoubtedly requires reliable estimation of function @xmath81 practically in all energy diapason of levels excited at thermal neutron capture .",
