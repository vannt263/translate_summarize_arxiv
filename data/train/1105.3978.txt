    "slow dynamics and aging processes are encountered in a huge variety of systems .",
    "the best known examples can of course be found in glassy systems , i.e. structural glasses and spin glasses , but intensive research in the last decade has revealed that this type of processes are ubiquitous and can be found in magnetic systems , in non - equilibrium growth or in diffusion - limited reaction systems .",
    "a recent overview of the field , with a focus on aging phenomena in non - glassy systems , can be found in @xcite .",
    "slow dynamics in non - glassy systems is often much easier to understand than in the more complex glassy systems , and much progress in our understanding of the general properties of aging processes has been achieved through the study of rather simple model systems with slow dynamics .",
    "reaction - diffusion systems have greatly contributed to our current understanding of the physics far from equilibrium .",
    "this is especially true for non - equilibrium phase transitions as encountered in systems with irreversible reactions and absorbing states @xcite . in this context",
    ", the study of relaxation and aging phenomena remains in its early stages .",
    "still , some interesting results have been found recently .",
    "as is well known , power - law relaxation , the hallmark of slow dynamics , is observed in diffusion - limited irreversible reactions at their ( non - equilibrium ) phase transition points .",
    "consequently , the first studies of aging in reaction - diffusion systems were restricted to these non - equilibrium critical points that are characterized by the absence of detailed balance @xcite .",
    "the analysis of two - time correlators @xmath0 and responses @xmath1 at an absorbing phase transition revealed a phenomenology similar to that observed at an equilibrium critical point .",
    "both quantities exhibit standard scaling forms , @xmath2 where the scaling functions display a simple power - law behavior for large arguments , @xmath3 : @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two different times called waiting and observation times , and @xmath7 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "the exponents @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are non - equilibrium exponents that govern the scaling properties of the two - time quantities .",
    "however , these studies also revealed some remarkable differences to the aging properties of systems relaxing towards an equilibrium steady state .",
    "most notably , the exponents @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which for a system relaxing towards equilibrium are identical and related to a static critical exponent @xcite , can be different when detailed balance is broken . in some cases",
    "this difference can be understood through symmetry properties of the model , as for example for the contact process @xcite , in other cases no simple explication seems to exist .    in order to observe slow dynamics at an absorbing phase transition ,",
    "a fine - tuning of the system parameters is obligatory .",
    "this is , however , different for systems with reversible reactions , as these systems generically display power - law relaxation , independent of the values of the reaction and diffusion rates @xcite .",
    "studies of excited - state proton transfer reactions provided experimental verifications of this theoretically predicted behavior @xcite .",
    "this of course makes the diffusion - limited systems with reversible reactions very attractive for a study of aging processes .    in @xcite a first step",
    "was undertaken in that direction where the non - equilibrium dynamical properties of some exactly solvable models were studied .",
    "this study indeed revealed the presence of the standard scaling forms ( [ eq : scal1 ] ) and ( [ eq : scal2 ] ) for correlation and response functions , and this for any values of the system parameters .",
    "surprisingly , however , the scaling of the response function was found to strongly depend on whether or not some specific quantity was kept constant when perturbing the system .",
    "more precisely , the study of the exactly solvable models showed that the breaking of conserved quantities yields an additional contribution to the response function that is waiting time independent .",
    "this is an interesting result , as it highlights the importance of conserved quantities during non - equilibrium relaxation .",
    "the models studied in @xcite are to some extend specialized in order to be exactly solvable .",
    "it is therefore of interest to understand which of the properties found in @xcite are generic to systems with reversible reactions and which depend on special features of the studied models .",
    "thus , in order to be soluble , it was assumed that the possible number of particles at every lattice site was unrestricted .",
    "in addition , as initial condition an uncorrelated poisson distribution on each lattice site and for each particle species was assumed . in this paper",
    "we study a system composed of two types of particles that undergo reversible reactions while diffusing on a lattice .",
    "we thereby only allow single site occupation and prepare the system by randomly distributing on the lattice a given number of particles of every type . during the relaxation process",
    "we study the two - time autocorrelation function as well as different two - time response functions .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section",
    "we discuss in more detail our model and introduce the various quantities that are monitored during the relaxation process .",
    "section 3 is devoted to our numerical results .",
    "focusing on the autocorrelation and autoresponses , we study their scaling properties , and this both in one and two dimensions .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "we consider one- and two - dimensional lattices on which particles of different types , called @xmath12 and @xmath13 , diffuse and interact .",
    "the data discussed in the following have mainly been obtained for systems of linear extend of @xmath14 in @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath17 .",
    "we carefully checked that no finite - size effects show up in our quantities for these sizes .",
    "the diffusion of particles is realized by jumping to unoccupied nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the reaction scheme considered here is given by @xmath18 where two neighboring @xmath12 particles coalesce to form a @xmath13 particle , whereas a @xmath13 particle can decompose into two @xmath12 particles , provided that one of the neighboring sites is empty .",
    "in the simulations , we realize this scheme in the following way .",
    "we first select randomly a site and a direction .",
    "if the selected site is occupied by a @xmath13 particle and if the neighboring site in the selected direction is empty , then the @xmath13 particle is hopping in that direction with probability @xmath19 or it is replaced by two neighboring @xmath12 particles with probability @xmath20 . if , on the other hand , an @xmath12 particle sits on the selected site , the possible action will depend on whether the neighboring site in the selected direction is either empty or occupied by an @xmath12 particle . in the first case we move the particle with probability @xmath21 , in the second case",
    "the two @xmath12 particles are replaced with probability @xmath22 by a @xmath13 particle that we put on the initially selected site . for all other cases",
    ", no action takes place .",
    "we prepare our system at time @xmath23  microcanonically  by distributing @xmath24 @xmath12 particles and @xmath25 @xmath13 particles randomly on our lattice .",
    "preparing the system in this strict way is in fact very important as the quantity @xmath26 is independent of time , making it a conserved quantity @xcite . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the numbers of @xmath12 and @xmath13 particles at time @xmath29 .",
    "it follows from the presence of this conserved quantity that the steady - state particle densities @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 in one dimension and @xmath33 in two dimensions , depend on the initial preparation of the system , besides depending on the values of the model parameters .    in our simulations",
    "we monitor both the particle density as well as the two - time correlation function . defining the time dependent occupation number @xmath34 of site @xmath35 as having the value 1 when that site is occupied at time @xmath29 by a @xmath13 particle and zero otherwise",
    ", the particle density of @xmath13 particles is given by @xmath36 due to the conserved quantity @xmath37 , the particle density of @xmath12 particles is obtained directly through the relation @xmath38 insights into the scaling properties during the relaxation process can be gained by studying the two - time connected autocorrelation function for @xmath13 particles , @xmath39 where the notation @xmath40 indicates averages over both initial conditions and realizations of the noise . in a similar way",
    "we define the two - time connected autocorrelation function for @xmath12 particles , @xmath41 .    for the two - time response function",
    "different cases can be distinguished .",
    "firstly , one can perturb the system in such a way that the quantity @xmath37 does not change its value .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by selecting an empty site and adding with probability @xmath42 a new @xmath13 particle to the system while removing at the same time pairs of @xmath12 particles .",
    "obviously , we do not think that this is a realistic scenario that can be easily achieved in an experiment .",
    "still , this scenario can be studied theoretically and might yield important insights into the role played by conserved quantities during relaxation processes .",
    "secondly , one can also perturb the system such that @xmath37 is no longer conserved . an obvious way of doing that is to inject on randomly selected empty sites additional particles of only one type ( say , @xmath13 particles ) with probability @xmath43 .",
    "this will change the value of @xmath37 , and the system will relax to a steady state whose particle densities differ from those of the unperturbed system .    in our simulations we have implemented the calculation of the responses in the following way .",
    "initially , we prepare the system in a random state with fixed numbers of @xmath12 and @xmath13 particles , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this fixes the value of @xmath37 at time @xmath23 . calling @xmath44 the response of the system to a perturbation that keeps @xmath37 constant , we compute the difference between the average densities with and without perturbation : @xmath45 /r_k~.\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath46 is the density of @xmath13 particles at time @xmath29 when the perturbation is removed at time @xmath47 .",
    "alternatively , we could define the response through the change in density of @xmath12 particles .",
    "we carefully checked that our conclusions do not depend on our choice of the particle density .",
    "for that reason we will restrict ourselves in the next section to a discussion of the change in the density of @xmath13 particles .",
    "the situation is remarkably different when considering the response to the injection of particles of a single type . in that case",
    "@xmath37 is no longer conserved , and the system , after removal of the perturbation , relaxes to a different steady state than the unperturbed system .",
    "in fact , depending on the realization of the noise , i.e. on the sequence of random numbers , different runs end up with different values of @xmath37 , yielding different asymptotic steady states . therefore , in order to be able to monitor the relaxation of every perturbed run to its asymptotic steady state , we need to compute for every run the difference in particle densities between the perturbed and an unperturbed run that both yield the same ( unknown ) steady state . in order to do that we proceed as follows . for every run",
    "we prepare the system as before and then inject additional particles until time @xmath5 . after removing the perturbation we determine the particle densities @xmath48 and @xmath49 as well as the new value of @xmath37 which will remain constant for the remainder of the simulation .",
    "having determined @xmath37 , we then do a second , unperturbed run , where we start with a disordered initial state with particle densities yields the same response in the scaling limit . ] @xmath50 and @xmath51 , i.e. this run takes place with the same value of @xmath37 as realized in the perturbed run once the perturbation has been removed . the response to the injection of @xmath13 particles",
    "is then calculated as the averaged difference between the densities with and without perturbation : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the time - dependent particle density of the unperturbed run at the value of @xmath37 that is obtained from the corresponding perturbed run . in this study",
    "we are only interested in the linear response regime .",
    "we carefully checked that for the values of the probabilities @xmath43 and @xmath42 considered in the next section the linear response regime prevails .",
    "in the following we discuss the relaxation and aging processes that take place in our system . in our systematic study we considered diffusion constants @xmath21 and @xmath19 between 0.05 and 0.5 , whereas the reaction probabilities @xmath22 and @xmath20 were varied between 0.1 and 0.7 .",
    "we also considered a vast range of initial conditions in order to study the dependence of our results on the value of @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , for a fixed value of @xmath37 we typically considered three sets of initial conditions that differ by the number of @xmath12 and @xmath13 particles deposited on the lattice . our main results for the time - dependent particle densities as well as for the two - time autocorrelation and response functions are summarized in the following subsections .",
    "these results are confronted with the analytical calculations obtained for the related model studied in @xcite .      as discussed in many theoretical studies @xcite and as verified in some experiments @xcite , systems with reversible chemical reactions",
    "are characterized by slow dynamics such that the particle densities approach their steady - state values with a power - law in time .",
    "more specifically , for the exactly solvable models without site restriction studied in @xcite one finds that particle densities asymptotically behave like @xmath54 for any dimension @xmath55 .",
    "explicit expressions have been found for the stationary particle densities which reveal a dependence only on the value of the conserved quantity @xmath37 and the ratio @xmath56 of the reaction probabilities @xcite .",
    "in fact , the steady state is a ( chemical ) equilibrium state , and the expressions for the stationary particle densities follow from the solution of the detailed balance condition of the master equation @xcite .",
    "= 4.25 in     in figure [ fig1 ] we show the typical time evolution of the particle densities for our system . after an initial fast change",
    ", the particle densities rapidly evolve towards a regime where the approach to the steady state is algebraic .",
    "figure 1 shows two cases with identical reaction and diffusion probabilities as well as with identical initial densities , the only difference being the dimensionality of the lattice . in both cases ,",
    "the asymptotic particle densities are found to be identical and independent of whether a line or a square lattice is considered , see figure [ fig1]a .",
    "changing the diffusion and reaction probabilities in a systematic way , we find that the stationary particle densities remain unchanged when the values of the diffusion constants are changed .",
    "in fact , and this is in agreement with the expressions obtained for the exactly solvable case in @xcite , the steady - state values of the particle densities are completely fixed by the values of @xmath37 and of the ratio @xmath56 .",
    "this should not come as a surprise as also in our case the steady state is an equilibrium state , due to the reversibility of the reactions .",
    "we also observe , see figure [ fig1]b , that the approach to stationarity is governed by the exponent @xmath57 , as it is the case for the corresponding exactly solvable model @xcite .",
    "the scaling of the two - time autocorrelation function in one and two dimensions is shown in figure [ fig2 ] for the @xmath13 particles ( similar results are obtained when looking at @xmath12 particles ) . in all cases",
    "we obtain the standard aging scaling ( [ eq : scal1 ] ) and ( [ eq : scal2 ] ) with exponents @xmath58 and @xmath59 . comparing the scaling functions for different values of the probabilities and different initial densities but fixed dimensionality",
    ", one observes that small differences , present for small values of @xmath60 , rapidly vanish when @xmath60 increases .",
    "disregarding these finite time corrections , one recovers for a fixed value of @xmath55 a common scaling function for all probabilities and initial states .",
    "= 4.25 in     it is tempting to compare our scaling functions with those obtained when site restriction is not imposed . as shown in @xcite the scaling function",
    "is then given in leading order by @xmath61 where the amplitude @xmath12 depends on reaction probabilities as well as on initial conditions and the steady - state particle densities .",
    "one therefore obtains for both models the same values of the exponents @xmath8 and @xmath62 . the expression ( [ eq_cor_elg ] )",
    "however only slowly approaches the scaling function obtained in the present study , as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "in fact , equation ( [ eq_cor_elg ] ) only gives the asymptotic scaling function , valid in the limit @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "subleading correction terms , which have not been identified systematically for the exactly solvable model @xcite , can not be neglected on the time scale of our simulations .",
    "our main motivation for the present study was the surprising observation in @xcite that the scaling function of the autoresponse strongly depends on how the system is perturbed .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , one obtains for the exactly solvable models studied in @xcite expressions for the responses that depend on whether or not certain quantities are conserved during the perturbation .",
    "our main aim in the following is to verify whether this is a generic behavior or whether this follows from the special properties of these exactly solvable models .",
    "we first remark that we wish in the following to understand the linear response regime . for that we carefully selected the probabilities for injecting additional particles by determining the range of values that leads to a linear dependence of the response on the values of the injection probabilities .",
    "we discuss in the following only cases that are well within that range .",
    "we start by showing in figure [ fig3 ] the time - integrated response ( [ res_k ] ) where the injection of a @xmath13 particle is accompanied by the removal of two @xmath12 particles such that @xmath37 remains constant .",
    "we recover a simple aging behavior , with exponents @xmath66 and @xmath67 , similar to what is obtained for this response when studying the model without site restriction .",
    "this scaling behavior of the integrated response is therefore similar to that observed in many systems relaxing toward their steady state while being characterized by a single time - dependent length scale that increases algebraically with time @xcite .",
    "= 4.25 in     the scaling of @xmath44 has to be contrasted with the scaling of @xmath68 where the perturbation consists in injecting additional @xmath13 particles .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig4 ] @xmath68 is _ independent _ of the waiting time and , after some initial faster decay , rapidly exhibits a power - law behavior , @xmath69 where the value of @xmath70 is compatible with @xmath57 , as indicated by the dashed lines in the figure . for the model studied in @xcite",
    "the time integrated response to the injections of only @xmath13 particles is the sum of two terms , one proportional to @xmath71 and one proportional to @xmath72 , see equation ( 41 ) in @xcite .",
    "the absence of the second term in our simulations can be understood when recalling the definition of our response .",
    "having determined the value of @xmath37 at the end of the perturbation , we start a second , unperturbed , run with that value of @xmath37 and after @xmath5 time steps we start measuring the difference in particle densities between the initial , perturbed , run and the new , unperturbed , run .",
    "therefore , we always compare densities that relax to the same steady - state value with the same power - law but with different amplitudes .",
    "because of this way of measuring the response , an independence on the waiting time can be expected .",
    "= 4.25 in     even so the behavior of our response differs from that in the model without site restriction , the main conclusion drawn in @xcite is still valid : the scaling properties of responses change when otherwise conserved quantities are changed due to the perturbation .",
    "more precisely , the appearance of a waiting time independent part in the response is due to the change of @xmath37 during the perturbation .",
    "this is a mathematical precise statement for the exactly solvable model with reversible reactions studied in @xcite .",
    "similar calculations are not possible for the model studied here , but the emergence of a waiting time independent response suggests that the same mechanism is in place .",
    "our results therefore suggest that this is a more general property of aging processes that take place in systems with conserved quantities .",
    "finally , let us put this result into a broader context by comparing it to results obtained in other systems .",
    "generally , one expects a response function to depend on the way the system has been perturbed ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in all cases known to us the scaling exponents are found to be independent of the perturbation .",
    "this is different for the reversible reaction - diffusion models , where the breaking of the conserved quantity yields a contribution of the response with a different dependence on the waiting time .",
    "we have discussed in this paper the non - equilibrium relaxation in a reaction - diffusion model characterized by reversible reactions .",
    "in contrast to systems with irreversible reactions , systems with reversible reactions generically display slow dynamics and simple aging , independent of the values of the reaction and diffusion probabilities . comparing our results with those obtained previously for a model with site restriction",
    ", we note that the approach to stationarity is govern by the same exponents in both cases , as revealed through the study of the time dependent particle densities or the two - time autocorrelation .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn when looking at the response to a perturbation that conserves the quantity @xmath37 , see equation ( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "it also remains true that the scaling properties of responses are found to depend on whether the perturbation conserves the value of @xmath37 or not .",
    "of course , other responses need to be studied in the future in order to further probe the universality of this statement .",
    "all this points to a high degree of universality , suggesting that systems with reversible reactions form excellent candidates for the experimental study of aging properties in reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "no fine - tuning of the system parameters is needed in order to have slow dynamics , as demonstrated in experimental studies of excited - state proton transfer reactions @xcite . as our theoretical findings point to a high robustness of the reported results , a future experimental verification of our predictions can be envisioned .",
    "our present study can readily be generalized to other reaction - diffusion systems . in this paper we considered one of the simplest reversible reaction scheme where two @xmath12 particles coalesce to form a @xmath13 particle which",
    "then can again decompose into two @xmath12 particles .",
    "other reaction schemes that can be studied are given by @xmath73 or @xmath74 especially the second reaction scheme is of interest , as it is not only realized readily in experiments ( a well known example is ethanoic acid dissolved in water that forms ethanoate and hydronium ions following the reactions @xmath75 ) , but it also has the interesting property that _ three _ different quantities are conserved @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to study the different responses in these systems in order to see how the scaling properties change when some or all conserved quantities are broken by the perturbation .",
    "work along these lines is planed for the future .",
