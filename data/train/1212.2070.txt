    "similar to atoms , superconducting circuits have a ground state and low - lying excitations which form a discrete and anharmonic energy spectrum .",
    "in much of the research geared towards solid - state quantum information processing , the energy levels above the lowest two can be ignored and , in slight but common abuse of language , the circuit is referred to as a superconducting qubit . once coupled to a resonator ,",
    "external microwave generators and detectors , the quantum state of the circuit can be manipulated and read out at will .",
    "strikingly , such superconducting circuits exhibit quantum coherence on a macroscopic scale : the size of superconducting qubits and transmission line resonators ranges from hundreds of micrometers to millimeters . nowadays ,",
    "experiments with such circuits are routinely used in producing entangled states and in producing effective photon - photon interactions , rendering them promising building blocks for larger quantum networks .",
    "this appeal of electric circuits , their modularity and relative ease of fabrication have greatly boosted the interest in the relatively young field of circuit qed @xcite .",
    "the simplest circuit qed system consists of a single superconducting qubit coupled to the electromagnetic field of a single mode inside a microwave resonator ( see fig .  [",

    "it represents an open - system realization of the well - known and exactly solvable jaynes - cummings model @xcite described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 here , @xmath1 creates a photon with energy @xmath2 in a particular resonator mode , @xmath3 are the raising and lowering operators for the superconducting qubit with transition energy @xmath4 , and @xmath5 determines the strength of the qubit - photon coupling . control and readout of the superconducting qubit",
    "can be modeled by incorporating driving and photon leakage into an open - system version of the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) .",
    "such open - system formulations describe the reduced density matrix of the system as obtained from a lindblad master equation or its unravelling in terms of quantum trajectories @xcite .",

    "the relatively slow rise of the number of qubits per chip an increase from 1 to 4 in the last eight years ( for comparison : trapped ion experiments succeeded in demonstrating entanglement among 14 qubits in 2011 @xcite) does not indicate limitations in fabrication . on the contrary , fabrication of hundreds of qubits on a single chip is well within the realm of existing technology .",
    "the slow increase in qubit number rather points to the formidable challenges posed by quantum computation , in particular for long coherence times , very high gate fidelities , and individual addressability of qubits . from this viewpoint ,",
    "building a circuit - based quantum _ simulator _ @xcite rather than a quantum computer , might offer a less ambitious but , arguably , equally exciting goal .",
    "indeed , well - controlled quantum systems with tunable hamiltonian and many degrees of freedom might ultimately provide invaluable clues about the nature of phases and dynamics of strongly correlated many - body systems for which the validity of various approximation schemes not infrequently remains a matter of debate .",
    "spectacular results have already been achieved with quantum simulators based on systems of ultracold atoms @xcite and trapped ions @xcite .",

    "photons are an unconventional choice for a quantum simulator .",
    "as opposed to atoms , their number is not strictly conserved and their interaction is virtually negligible for frequencies easily accessible in the lab .",
    "the jaynes - cummings model ( [ hjc ] ) indicates how to cure the latter ailment . in this model , the interaction between photons and matter leads to mediated photon - photon interaction .",
    "the circuit qed implementation of a photon - based quantum simulator thus consists of the step from a single jaynes - cummings system ( see fig .",

    "legendre transform to the classical hamiltonian , 3 .",
    "quantization via @xmath11 ,    where the @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote generalized variables and corresponding conjugate momenta .",
    "the majority of work is invested into the first step . to formulate a circuit lagrangian , we first select generalized coordinates @xmath14 for the circuit .",

    ", @xmath16 denotes the electric potential at node @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting generalized coordinate is the time integral of the node voltage , starting at a fixed reference time @xmath18 , and has dimensions of magnetic flux . for a circuit with @xmath19 individual nodes ,",

    ", this constraint is accounted for by selecting one element in each loop to act as the  closure branch , \" for which the variables enter as @xmath26 thus including the external flux .",
    "after legendre transformation and canonical quantization , one thus obtains the quantum hamiltonian for the circuit .",
    "a word of caution is in order regarding `` shortcuts '' that claim to directly obtain the hamiltonian : the legendre transform , in general , requires the inversion of the capacitance matrix and is trivial only for the most simplistic circuits describable by a single generalized coordinate .",
    "the circuits used as superconducting qubits @xcite are prime examples for circuit quantization at work .",

    "as long as their capacitances are small compared to the total resonator capacitance , @xmath49 , photons can hop from one resonator to its nearest neighbors only .",
    "focusing on a single mode in each resonator , the photon sublattice is thus described by @xmath50 as usual , the operators @xmath51 , @xmath52 raise and lower the number of photons in resonator @xmath17 with frequency @xmath53 by 1 and obey the canonical commutation rules @xmath54=\\delta_{nm}$ ] for indistinguishable bosons .    for full - wavelength mode and uniform hopping , @xmath55 , the hopping amplitude @xmath56 carries a positive sign @xcite .",

    "the interaction between qubits and resonator photons typically takes the form @xmath58 assuming that each site of the circuit qed lattice consists of a simple rabi or jaynes - cummings system , i.e. , a single resonator coupled to a qubit located inside the resonator .",
    "generalizations of this , such as multiple qubits coupling to the same local resonator , are naturally conceivable and have been demonstrated experimentally .",

    "capacitive coupling of the junction electric charge to the voltage field inside the resonator resembles the dipole coupling of an atom to the electromagnetic field .",

    "circuit qed arrays realizing the jchm have a rather trivial ground state , namely the vacuum state void of photons and with all qubits occupying the ground state . here ,",
    "a key difference from ultracold atoms arises from the fact that the grand - canonical ensemble does not exist for photons : coupling to a heat bath alone , i.e. , working in the canonical ensemble , already introduces additional photons into the system .",
    "( an alternative wording describing the same situation is that the chemical potential for photons always vanishes , see @xcite . )",
    "a significant host of theoretical work has been based on the assumption that a chemical potential might still be engineered if the time scale for reaching a quasi - equilibrium with given photon number is much shorter than the time scale at which photons escape from the system .",

    ", however , remains an open question .",
    "one way or another , the full theoretical description of circuit qed arrays will need to account for the essential openness of this quantum system : the array is driven out of equilibrium with microwave generators to introduce photons , and photons leaking out of the array reveal crucial information about the quantum state inside .    provided coupling to the environment is sufficiently weak and power spectra of associated noises show little variations at the frequencies of interest , lindblad master equations and their unraveling in terms of quantum trajectories constitute a robust framework for studying dynamics as well as steady - state physics of driven arrays @xcite .",

    "one of the most spectacular consequences of the nonlinearity in eq .   is the photon blockade effect @xcite . when a weak coherent drive is resonant with the lowest transition in the spectrum ( @xmath95 ) the cavity will be populated with a single photon , but the entrance of a second photon is effectively blocked .",

    "have been observed in measurements of heterodyne transmission , resonance fluorescence spectra , as well as the photon statistics in linear response .",
    "a necessary requirement for the clear manifestation of photon blockade is that the spectral shift in eq .   is larger than the drive strength and the linewidth of the polaritons ( @xmath96 ) so that multi - photon processes are suppressed .    for a weakly driven jaynes - cummings system ,",
    "the heterodyne transmission @xmath97 exhibits lorentzian peaks when the drive frequency matches with lower or upper polariton frequency .",
    "beyond linear response , the lorentzian splits and develops a central dip , i.e , an antiresonant lineshape termed supersplitting in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . this phenomenon can be simply understood in the truncated hilbert space of only two states in the jaynes - cummings ladder , namely the vacuum state and the upper or lower single - polariton state . within this two - level system ,",
    "the heterodyne transmission signal is equivalent to the polarization of the dressed two - level system and can be calculated exactly  @xcite . for strong",
    "driving , the transmission vanishes exactly at the center of the linear - response transmission peak .",
    "this somewhat surprising result originates from the saturation of the two - level system in an equal mixture of its two states , rendering the average polarization and thus the heterodyne transmission signal effectively zero .    inside a nonlinear cavity ,",
    "the qubit first gets dressed by the quantum cavity field ( leading to the effective two - level system described above ) .",
    "adding an additional classical drive thus corresponds to a dressing of dressed states @xcite .",
    "another manifestation of this dressing is the appearance of a triplet peak structure in resonance fluorescence spectra , known as the mollow triplet @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking consequences of photon blockade can be seen in the statistics of the emitted light . in the blockade regime ,",
    "no more than one photon is present inside the cavity at a time .",
    "only if this photon is emitted , e.g. , leaving through the leaky mirrors , another photon is allowed to enter .",
    "when the time the photon spends inside the cavity is much larger than the decay time , i.e. , under strong coupling conditions , the photon decay leads to an anti - bunched train of photons leaking out of the cavity .",

    "a coherently driven jaynes - cummings array with three sites has also been proposed to act as a josephson interferometer @xcite : when the outer sites are driven photon blockade manifests in a suppression of josephson oscillations in the center cavity , leading to characteristic changes in the statistics of emitted photons .",

    "similar to the bhm , the jchm obeys a global @xmath126 symmetry associated with the conservation of the total number of polaritons @xmath19 . in order to calculate the jchm phase diagram it is thus convenient to work in the grand - canonical formalism and to introduce a chemical potential @xmath38 for polaritons according to @xmath127 .",
    "results for the quantum phase diagram can then be derived from a simple mean - field theory by decoupling the hopping term via @xcite @xmath128 here we assume an infinite system with lattice translational invariance and denote the resulting order parameter by @xmath129 .",

    "this decoupling scheme maps the original lattice model to an effective local on - site hamiltonian .",

    "[ fig3 ] is then obtained by minimizing the ground - state energy of the local mean - field hamiltonian with respect to @xmath131 .    inside the mott lobes , on - site repulsion dominates over photon",
    "hopping and local fluctuations of the photon number are strongly suppressed corresponding to a localized mott state for photons and polaritons ( since the qubits are trivially localized ) . outside the mott lobes",
    ", photons are delocalized over the lattice and form a weakly interacting polariton superfluid .",
    "the quantum phase transition between these two phases takes place at some critical value of the hoping strength @xmath121 ( at fixed detuning @xmath122 ) , where the mott lobes terminate .",
    "formally , this mean - field approximation only becomes exact in the limit of large coordination numbers , @xmath132 @xcite . in practice , the mean - field diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is in qualitative agreement with exact numerics down to @xmath133 , e.g. , for a two - dimensional square lattice . for one - dimensional lattices",

    "the precise location and shape of the phase boundary can be determined numerically by using various methods including dmrg calculations in 1d @xcite , variational cluster approximations @xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "modified models capturing next - nearest - neighbor , diagonal and long - range photon hopping in 1d and 2d also lead to substantial changes in the mott lobe sizes @xcite .",

    ", the nature of the polaritons can be photon - like ( @xmath134 ) or qubit - like ( @xmath135 ) . at the same time , finite detuning @xmath136 weakens the nonlinearity of the spectrum and thus reduces the size of the mott lobes  with one exception : the size of the lowest mott lobe ( @xmath125 ) increases for positive detuning . only in this case",
    "the nature of all polaritons in the lattice become qubit - like and are thus trivially localized .",

    "they can be neglected as long as @xmath139 , but need to be included for ultra - strong couplings with @xmath120 . in the presence of these counter - rotating terms , the jchm maps to the transverse field ising model , which features a discrete @xmath140 parity symmetry - breaking transition @xcite .",
    "the same phase transition could also be realized in a chain of josephson junctions with direct electric dipole coupling . here",
    ", circuit qed can be used for high - resolution spectroscopy by attaching transmission line resonators to the end of the chain @xcite .",
    "the assumption of an effective chemical potential in the previous section requires that the system equilibrates on a time - scale much shorter than the lifetime of polariton quasi - particles . while this appears applicable to some experimental setups with large coherence times such as phonon- polaritons in trapped ion systems @xcite , it is yet unclear whether the same can be achieved within the circuit qed architecture . taking into account the basic non - equilibrium nature of most quantum optics experiments ,",
    "in particular the presence of drives and dissipation , is one of the biggest challenges in the field .",
    "new tools and methods are needed to investigate the interplay between strong correlations and collective behavior under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "for the bose - hubbard model , quench dynamics was studied to assess the effects of dissipation on the sf - mi phase transition @xcite .",
    "initializing the system with a suitable excitation pulse in a mott - like state , the system response turns out to be highly sensitive to the properties of the underlying equilibrium ground - state .",
    "while the absolute value of the order parameter decays as @xmath141 and thus contains no valuable information , the rescaled coherence parameter @xmath142 reveals the equilibrium sf - mi phase transition unambiguously . in particular , in the long - time limit",
    "one obtains @xmath143 for @xmath144 , i.e. , in the mott phase , and @xmath145 for @xmath146 , i.e. , in the superfluid phase ( @xmath147 denotes the critical hopping strength of the quantum phase transition in equilibrium at the tip of the lobe ) .",
    "the distinction between mott and superfluid phases becomes sharp only when @xmath148 , but is smoothened and washed out when @xmath75 is non - zero .",
    "in fact , dissipation tends to favor the localized regime @xcite .",
    "consequently , quench dynamics allow for the observation of clear and sharp signatures of an equilibrium phase transition even in open dissipative systems .",
    "qualitatively new effects can be expected when dissipation is compensated by an external pump , which drives the system into a non - equilibrium steady state , rather than the ground state .",
    "large arrays with up to @xmath149 cavities , each of them driven by a coherent source , have been treated in @xcite using a time evolving block decimation algorithm for the bhm .",
    "a similar algorithm has recently also been applied to the jchm @xcite .",
    "this numerical technique allows to treat relatively large system sizes but is limited to a regime with small inter - site entanglement , i.e. , for weak photon hopping . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that when a weak drive is applied to each cavity with opposite phases on neighboring sites , photons crystallize into a dimerized steady state with positive correlations in neighbouring cavities , but anti - correlations for larger separations .",
    "steady states in a driven , infinite lattice have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite using a generalization of the decoupling mean - field approximation in eq .",
    "to density matrices .",
    "this yields a nonlinear , but closed system of equations for the time evolution of local operator expectation values .",
    "for weak hopping , one finds that an infinite jc lattice remains photon blockaded . for strong",
    "hopping , photon blockade breaks down and key signatures like anti - resonant lineshapes in homodyne detection , mollow triplets in rf spectra , and antibunching of photons are destroyed @xcite .",
    "note that this is in agreement with the perturbative result in eq .",
    ", which predicts that the nonlinearity vanishes in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath150 ) . the crossover from weak to strong hopping is smooth as long as the array is pumped at the bottom of the lower polariton band  @xcite .",
    "thus , no traces of the equilibrium quantum phase transition remain , which is to be expected since the external drive explicitly breaks the @xmath126 symmetry of the hamiltonian",
    ". however , higher pump frequencies may cause tunneling induced bistabilities @xcite . contrary to the usual bistable behavior in quantum optics known for a single cavity @xcite and for the dicke model @xcite , here , the bistability develops at fixed pump strength when increasing the hopping rate @xmath10 between cavities on a large lattice and might thus be interpreted as a first - order non - equilibrium phase transition from a localized to a delocalized state .",
    "so far , the jchm was discussed in the context of a possible superfluid - mott insulator transition of polaritons .",
    "however , the jchm also represents the multi - mode version of the dicke model , which is commonly used to describe weakly interacting polariton bec s in solid - state micro - cavities @xcite . in circuit qed , the single - mode dicke model @xcite can be realized in a chain of qubits coupled near resonantly to a single mode of a transmission line resonator .",
    "it is a current matter of debate whether one can realize a superradiance transition with such a device , if operated in the ultra - strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "jaynes - cummings lattices also show rich and versatile physics in the context of artificial gauge fields for photons @xcite . by now , multiple mechanisms have been proposed to break time - reversal symmetry in circuit qed lattices @xcite .",
    "for instance , time - reversal symmetry may be broken by using additional passive superconducting circuits as inter - cavity couplers instead of employing direct capacitive coupling .",
    "this design gives rise to complex phases in the photon hopping terms , which can be used to study further interesting strongly correlated phenomena including topological phases and chiral edge modes @xcite or the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "first experiments in this direction are currently underway @xcite .",
    "with the remarkable level of control over small circuit qed systems and the first experimental realizations of small circuit qed lattices at hand , the field is rapidly developing and attracting physicists with a variety of backgrounds ranging from quantum optics and mesoscopic physics to condensed matter physics and strongly correlated systems . combining circuit qed with other architectures in so - called hybrid systems",
    "has already begun and will further continue to drive the field @xcite .    from the theoretical perspective it is important to identify model systems simple enough for obtaining reliable , quantitative predictions . such models will serve as a testbed for the characterization and optimization of the first experimental implementations of circuit qed lattices . at the same time , new mathematical tools and approximation schemes need to be developed in order to treat non - equilibrium physics , collective behavior of large ensembles and strong correlations on an equal footing .",
    "of course , the ultimate goal of a quantum simulator is to invert the roles of theory and experiment : experimental results for large systems will provide crucial information and guidance for the development of robust theoretical models of interacting quantum systems with many degrees of freedom in and out of equilibrium .",
