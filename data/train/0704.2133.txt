    "adiabatic pair creation ( apc ) has been called  unfortunately misleading  spontaneous pair creation ( @xcite,@xcite - @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the creation of electron positron pairs in very strong external classical electromagnetic fields arises straight forwardly from the dirac sea interpretation of negative energy states .",
    "after dirac@xcite it has been discussed as an academic problem by klein @xcite , sauter @xcite , heisenberg and euler @xcite , schwinger @xcite and brezin and itzykson @xcite . a more realistic setting was hinted at by beck , steinwedel and smann , @xcite and worked out by gershtein and zeldovich @xcite as apc . in the common physics language",
    "it may be described as follows : an adiabatically increasing electric potential lifts a particle from the sea to the positive energy subspace where it scatters and when the potential is gently switched off one has one free electron and one unoccupied state  a hole  in the sea .",
    "the experimental verification needs very strong classical fields @xcite and is discussed elsewhere @xcite . in this respect",
    "we would like to remark that a coherent analysis of the existence of apc has been lacking until recently @xcite .",
    "earlier quantitative results based on an ad hoc and incoherent analysis ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) are false concerning the rate and the outgoing momenta of the spontaneously created pairs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there have been also results in the mathematical physics literature related to apc , notably @xcite but those results do not come to grasp at all with the heart of the problem of apc , which is the control of the wavefunction evolution within the neighborhood of the spectral edge @xmath0 .    in apc one",
    "considers the so called external field problem , where interactions between the charges are neglected .",
    "vacuum polarization will in general perturb the external field and - using mean field approximation -(see @xcite ) one may think of the external field as an effective field .",
    "the existence of apc in second quantized external field dirac theory ( if the latter exists is equivalent to the existence of certain types of solutions of the dirac equation ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) which we describe below .",
    "the existence of apc in terms of the second quantised s - matrix theory of the dirac equation with external field is `` by definition '' equivalent to the existence of these types of solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "we shall in fact formulate our result in terms of the solutions of the dirac equation and use the dirac sea picture for the interpretation of the particular solution we prove in this paper to exist .",
    "consider the dirac equation with external electric field .",
    "then the potential @xmath1 can be chosen as a real valued multiple of the @xmath2 unit matrix .",
    "( we wish to note that the results can be extended to general four potentials . concerning strong magnetic fields we wish to call attention to the recent work of dolbeault et.al .",
    "@xcite as well as @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath3 gives the potential in the units @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the potential @xmath1 varies slowly with time , expressed by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a dimensionless small parameter ( given by the physics , see @xcite for some examples ) which in this work will eventually be sent to zero to obtain limit results . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dimensionless microscopic time- and space - scales and the dirac equation in the standard representation reads with the notation @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 we introduce in ( [ diracmicalt ] ) the macroscopic time scale @xmath12 . we wish to restrict ourselves to potentials @xmath13 which can be factorized into a space- and a time dependent factor @xmath14 , a restriction of technical nature which eases notations and computations and which furthermore helps to picture a spatial potential well which changes its depth with time .",
    "it is helpful to have this picture in mind , because the potential does act as an elevator , as we shall explain below .",
    "we thus have @xmath15 furthermore we wish to restrict ourselves to potentials @xmath16 which are smooth , bounded , compactly supported in @xmath17 and @xmath18 and positive .",
    "the spectrum of the free dirac operator @xmath19 is absolutely continuous and given by @xmath20\\cap[1,\\infty)$ ] , defining `` negative and positive energy '' subspaces . in the dirac sea interpretation wavefunctions which lie in the positive energy subspace of the free dirac operator",
    "are interpreted as wavefunctions of electrons .",
    "the so called vacuum of second quantized dirac equation corresponds in the dirac sea picture to all `` states of the negative energy subspace being occupied by particles''the dirac sea .",

    "no bound states exist in the lower and upper spectral continua @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "pair creation is achieved ( with probability one ) if a particle from the sea which occupied at small times @xmath18 the bound states @xmath22 corresponding to the gap bridging bound state energy curve scatters after the bound state curve has reached the upper spectral set @xmath25 at time @xmath26 , and when that bound state becomes a scattering state .",
    "the `` returning bound state '' is then unoccupied producing a hole in the sea . ]",
    "the goal of our paper is to assert that there exist solutions of ( [ diracmic ] ) which describe pair creation .",
    "we explain what that means .",
    "the main idea of apc , as illustrated in figure [ bild ] is as follows .",
    "consider first the spectrum of the time dependent dirac operator @xmath27 . at large negative and large positive times when @xmath28 , @xmath29 and we have the spectrum of @xmath19 . at times",
    "at which @xmath30 there may be eigenvalues in the gap @xmath31 $ ] , while the continuous spectrum remains unchanged .",
    "the eigenvalues change with the strength of the potential , i.e. with time @xmath18 ( bound state energy curve @xmath21 in figure [ bild ] ) .",
    "suppose first that no eigenvalue reaches @xmath32 , .i.e .",
    "no bound state energy curve bridges the gap ( undercritical case ) .",
    "the adiabatic theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) ensures that there is no tunnelling across spectral gaps meaning that the bound states stay more or less intact when the potentials changes adiabatically . in terms of solutions of the dirac equation ( [ diracmic ] )",
    "that means the following : there exists no solution when @xmath6 goes to zero which for large negative times lies completely within the negative continuous energy subspace and for large positive times has parts in the positive continuous energy subspace . in the dirac sea interpretation that means :",
    "the probability of creating a pair is zero .",
    "no apc .",
    "however , when the external field becomes overcritical ( at time @xmath26 in figure [ bild ] ) , the highest lying eigenvalue curve reaches the positive continuum and the bound state ceases to exist and becomes a continuum state ( a `` resonance '' ) in the positive continuum subspace .",
    "then there exists a solution of the dirac equation which follows adiabatically the path of this bound state , which for large negative times must develop into a wavefunction which lies entirely in the negative continuum energy subspace and for positive times may have a part in the positive continuum energy subspace . as indicated in the figure [ bild ] when the potential decreases with increasing time there is again a bound state energy curve bridging the gap . in principle",
    "the solution of the dirac equation can have a part which `` follows '' the bound state back into the negative continuous energy subspace and remains there when the potential is switched off . in the dirac sea interpretation",
    "such a solution of the dirac equation would correspond to pair creation with a probability determined by the absolute squares of the parts of the wave functions .",
    "we show however , that no such `` back sliding '' is adiabatically possible , i.e. no such solution of the dirac equation exists .",
    "the former bound state scatters in the positive continuum energy subspace , i.e. it stays there for all later times . in the dirac sea picture",
    "the `` returning '' bound state remains for sure empty and upon becoming a state within the negative continuum energy subspace there is now an unoccupied state in the sea : apc is accomplished with probability one .",
    "one pictorial way to describe apc is to imagine the potential acting as an elevator , lifting a particle from the sea to the `` upper''(positive ) continuum .",
    "the scenario is symmetric under change of sign of the potential : it then transports an unoccupied state ( a hole ) from the positive continuum to the sea and catches a particle from the sea when it is switched off .",
    "the hole ( positron ) then scatters .",
    "we understand now the type of solution of ( [ diracmic ] ) we wish to study , namely one which at some time at which an overcritical bound state exists equals that bound state .",
    "the scenario we described translates mathematically into the task to establish scattering of such solutions of the time - inhomogenous dirac equation ( [ diracmic ] ) .",
    "to show to what extend the scenario of apc holds one must control first that the bound states stay on the adiabatic time scale intact until the eigenvalues reach the positive continuum .",
    "that is content of an adiabatic lemma without a gap and `` relatively easy '' to establish .",
    "the solution of ( [ diracmic ] ) is thus adiabatically essentially represented by the `` time dependent bound states '' until that time .",
    "then we must control the propagation of the wavefunction ( the resonance ) emerging from the bound state during over - criticality .",
    "we wish to show that it scatters .",
    "this task is on the one hand far from being easy , since the dirac operator changes with time .",
    "the time evolution will be controlled by generalized eigenfunctions , i.e. by the stationary phase argument , which is of course not standard because the generalized eigenfunctions themselves are depending now on time .",
    "but more than that on the other hand we must take into account the bad ( resonant ) behavior of the generalized eigenfunctions near criticality .",
    "( we wish to note that also @xcite is concerned with the wavefunction propagation for time dependent hamiltonians but under generic smallness assumptions on the potential , assumptions which are not fulfilled in our problem ) .",
    "they become unbounded for critical @xmath33-values ( which are small ) and hence the situation is very much different from the usual scattering situation governed by `` plane waves '' ( see @xcite for a heuristic argument giving some intuition ) . as we shall find out ,",
    "the decay time of a wave , say from a bounded spatial region ( i.e. the time in which roughly half of the mass left the region ) , is now ( on the microscopic time ) @xmath34 as compared to @xmath35 in the common plane wave scattering situation .",
    "this means that the resonance lingers around the range of the potential for a much longer time than in the usual scattering of wavefunctions .",
    "such a metastable state decay has already been suggested by @xcite .",
    "we shall give in the next section the result : theorem [ onecrit ] and corollary [ psipropneu ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of the theorem .",
    "the proof is technically very involved . instead of describing here what is in the sections to follow",
    "we first give the result and then give in section [ skeleton ] a skeleton of the proof with a description of the contents of the sections .",
    "we begin with    the functions we mainly consider are spinors in the space @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "we shall denote this space if no ambiguity arises simply by @xmath38 .",
    "we shall have two scalar products : ( i ) for @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath42 : @xmath43 , @xmath44 . warning : constants appearing in estimates will generically be denoted by @xmath45",
    ". we shall not distinguish constants appearing in a sequence of estimates , i.e. in @xmath46 the constants may differ .",
    "in the following we will only consider potentials which are bounded , compactly supported , positive and purely electric .",
    "the latter implies that @xmath1 will be a multiple of the unit matrix ( since we stick to one inertial frame throughout the paper ) .",
    "thus @xmath1 can be written as a scalar function . to have the possibility of pair creation the external ( scalar ) field @xmath47 has to become critical for some time @xmath18 and the first such time will be set @xmath48 and we choose @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath1 is critical .",
    "criticality means for us that @xmath50 has only bound states solutions ( i.e. @xmath51-solutions and no resonances with energy @xmath32 ) of @xmath52 this is the generic case ( see e.g. @xcite ) of critical potentials in the dirac equation .",

    "we need good control of `` how a bound state converges '' .",

    "the proof of ( 2 ) is naturally much more involved than that of ( 1 ) .    1 .",
    "we wish to show that any bound state at the spectral edge scatters .",
    "what we need to establish is that the wavefunction leaves the range of the scattering potential sufficiently fast , faster than @xmath100 , the time after which the potential is undercritical again .",
    "such control is rather easy when the potential is not depending on time , but here it depends on time : how does one control the evolution of wavefunctions for time dependent hamiltonians ?",
    "the most direct and physical way is using generalized eigenfunctions .",
    "the point is however that the generalized eigenfunctions are bad near the spectral edge !",
    "the essential question is : how bad ?",
    "we recall here and rely heavily on a result of @xcite on generalized eigenfunctions near criticality . that is done in section [ secgef ] .",
    "the eigenfunctions allow us to control the wavefunction evolution for potentials constant in time .",
    "section [ secpe ] gives with lemma [ propzeta ] preliminary estimates .",

    "corollary [ propestalt2 ] formulates then three estimates for the @xmath101 norms . at first sight",
    "the third estimate ( ( iii ) of corollary [ propestalt2 ] ) seems the only relevant one , but the first two are in fact needed for technical reasons later .",
    "( the technical reason is that we must bring the `` static potential estimates '' in contact with the true time evolution , i.e. with the non - static potential ) .",

    "the stationary phase application leading to good decay is unfortunately lengthy , while not difficult or tricky .",
    "therefore we decided to shift that calculation to the appendix .",
    "3 .   in section [ secpe1 ]",
    "the contact with the true time evolution is made .",
    "first we consider the wavefunction evolution for `` short times '' .",
    "short means macroscopic times of order one .",
    "we introduce the time @xmath102 which may roughly be thought of as being the first time at which @xmath65 reaches a maximum .",
    "here we use the estimate ( iii ) of corollary [ propest ] , which is the translation of corollary [ propestalt2 ] to the macroscopic time scale .",
    "it is shown that most of the wavefunction will have left the range of the potential by a macroscopic time of order @xmath103 , i.e. @xmath104 on the microscopic time scale .",
    "that proof uses cook s argument in combination with physical insights : we need to compare the true evolution until time @xmath105 with a `` static potential '' evolution .",
    "the potential will be `` frozen '' to the value it has at a time @xmath18 .",
    "there is a big error between the true and the auxiliary time evolution .",
    "but in terms of the evolution of the relevant part of the wavefunction the error is not so big , since most of the wavefunction will have left the range of the potential .",
    "so the error is transported to a region in space which we do not care so much about .",
    "that idea is behind this part of the proof . of course",
    ", we must insure that for very long times , this error does not come back ! but that is done in the next step .",

    "we extend our result to all times .",
    "most of the wavefunction has left the range of the potential , we must insure that it stays like that .",

    "in fact we can chose here any value @xmath85 for which the potential is overcritical .",
    "the physical idea is clear : since most of the wavefunction is outside of the range of the potential it moves freely and the critical potential is roughly the zero potential . to avoid problems arising from small @xmath33 values , we use density arguments and cut off small momenta .",
