    "cobe @xcite , wmap @xcite and other experiments on measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy have inspired a lot of the works on the classical inflationary potential reconstruction ( see , for example , ref .",
    "however , it is generally accepted that the quantum effects have to be taken into account at initial stage of the cosmological evolution .",
    "the question arises , at what stage of the universe evolution the classical description is applicable .",
    "a simplest possibility to clear up this is to built the heisenberg picture of a minisuperspace model and to calculate the mean values and the dispersions of observables .",
    "if at some moment of cosmological time @xmath2 , we would reveal that for the operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 describing the universe dynamics ( they can be universe scale factor , value of scalar field etc . )",
    "the relation @xmath5 is satisfied with a sufficient accuracy , then we would change the operators in the operator equations by their mean values and , hence , consider the universe classically . appearance of a classical world in quantum cosmology is widely discussed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , and citation therein ) . as a rule ,",
    "the wigner function served as a diagnostic tool for the problem . in quantum region",
    "the wigner function is highly oscillating and has no classical limit in the general case .",
    "but under evaluation of the mean value its oscillations are averaged .",
    "thus , the method considering the observable mean values and dispersions seems to be more straightforward for analyzing of transition to the classics than a direct analysis of the wigner function .",
    "the first step is choosing of an appropriate quantization scheme .",
    "a variety of the quantization schemes for a minisuperspace model can be roughly divided in two classes : imposing the constraints i ) `` before quantization '' @xcite and ii ) `` after quantization '' @xcite ( see also reviews comparing both approaches @xcite ) .    in the former ,",
    "the constraints are used to exclude `` nonphysical '' degrees of freedom . this allows then constructing hamiltonian acting in the reduced `` physical '' phase space . in such models , universe dynamics",
    "is introduced by the time - depended gauge .",
    "gauge of this type should identify the universe scale factor with the prescribed monotonic function of time @xcite .",
    "this results in a non - vanishing and generically non - stationary hamiltonian of the system and , thus , in the equations of motion .",
    "such a procedure can not be wholly satisfactory , since it requires to introduce a priori arbitrary function and does not allow considering the universe scale factor as quantum observable .",
    "the alternative schemes prefer imposing the constraint  after quantization \" .",
    "this leads to the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation on quantum states of universe @xcite .",
    "we believe that it is most correct description of the quantum universe .",
    "nevertheless , a problem of extraction of the information about the universe evolution in time remains , because there is no an explicit `` time '' in the corresponding wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation .",
    "this inspires discussions about `` time disappearance '' and interpretation of the wave function of universe @xcite .",
    "possible solutions and interpretations of this problem like to introduce time along the quasi - classical trajectories , or subdivide universe into classical and quantum parts have been offered @xcite .",
    "our point of view is that one can solve the `` problem of time '' radically , without appealing to the quasiclassics .",
    "let us note that i ) for some observable @xmath6 the commutators @xmath7 $ ] are nontrivial , i.e. the equation of motion remain in force even in ordinary heisenberg picture , ii ) absence of evolution of the mean values can be proved only in the schrdinger normalization of the universe wave function .",
    "namely , for evolution of mean value of some heisenberg operator @xmath8 we have @xmath9 let @xmath10 contains differential operators like @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that the wave function @xmath13 obeys @xmath14 ( i.e. it is `` on shell '' ) and is normalized in the schrdinger style , one can move @xmath15 to the left side by habitual operation @xmath16 through integration by parts ( and do the same for @xmath12 ) . as a result",
    ", @xmath17 and one finds no an evolution of the mean values with the time .",
    "iii ) however , the universe wave function can not be normalized in the schrdinger style if the most natural laplacian like operator ordering in the wheeler - dewitt equation is chosen ( for closed universe and unnatural operator ordering schrdinger s norm can be archived @xcite ) .",
    "if the wave function is unbounded along one of the variables ( e.g. @xmath18 variable ) its normalization differs from the schrdinger one and absence of evolution of the operator mean values can not be proven .",
    "it gives a hope that some heisenberg - like picture is possible for the klein  gordon normalization .",
    "certainly , the ordinary heisenberg operators are not suitable for this aim because they are not hermite in the normalization above .",
    "also , it should be mentioned , there are the works where the schrdinger normalization for the `` off shell '' states ( i.e. not obeying the constraints ) has been used @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite after evaluation of the mean values of the operators , the proceeding to limit of the `` on shell '' states ( which satisfy the constraints ) leads the time - dependence of the expectation values of some operators . another procedure has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the constraint is considered as an equation connecting expectation values of the operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , origin and description of our quantization scheme ( i.e. quantization rules for the equations of motion and formula for evaluation of the mean values ) are expounded .",
    "quantization rules for the quasi - heisenberg operators are defined consistently with choice of the hyperplane used for normalization of solutions of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation in the klein  gordon style .    in section [ two ]",
    ", the approximate solution is obtained numerically for the quasi - heisenberg operators and the corresponding mean values are evaluated and discussed .",
    "transition to universe having negligible dispersion of the scale factor is discussed in section [ third ] . in section [ measurem ] ,",
    "the measurement and interpretation problems in the quantum universe are discussed .",
    "let us start from the einstein action for a gravity and an one - component real scalar field : @xmath19 , \\label{deistv}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the scalar curvature and @xmath21 is the matter potential which includes a possible cosmological constant effectively .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the homogeneous and isotropic metric : @xmath22 here the lapse function @xmath23 represents the general time coordinate transformation freedom . for the restricted metric the total action becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the signature of the spatial curvature , and @xmath26 is the constant defining volume of the universe .",
    "it is equal to @xmath27 for the closed universe and is infinite for the flat and open ones .",
    "for quantization of the flat and open universes , @xmath26 should be some properly fixed constant .",
    "it is suggested that some fluctuation , from which the universe arises , can be approximately considered as isolated , having no local degrees of freedom and obeying dynamics of the uniform and isotropic universe .",
    "constant @xmath26 , corresponding to the `` volume '' occupied by this fluctuation is to be such that the value of @xmath28 is greater than the visible part of universe , which is known to be isotropic and uniform .",
    "further we set @xmath26 to unity , i.e. approximately @xmath29 part from the volume of the closed universe",
    ".    the action ( [ action ] ) can be obtained from the following expression by varying on @xmath30 and @xmath31 : @xmath32 varying on @xmath23 gives the constraint @xmath33 this constraint turns into the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation @xmath34 after quantization : @xmath35=-i$ ] , @xmath36=i$ ] .",
    "attempts to modernize or remove the constraint equation can be justified within the framework of theories implying existence of some preferred system of reference .",
    "for instance , the logunov s relativistic theory of gravity @xcite , which gives an adequate description of the universe expansion @xcite , allows omitting the constraint @xcite .",
    "however , here we shall keep to the general relativity .",
    "let us first consider the flat universe ( @xmath37 ) with @xmath38 ( corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath39 in the units @xmath40 ) .",
    "procedure , which is invariant under general coordinate transformations consists in postulating the quantum hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 . for our choice of variables @xmath43 , @xmath44 , the metric has the form : @xmath45 so that @xmath46 , @xmath47",
    ". then the hamiltonian is @xmath48    explicit expression for the wave function satisfying @xmath49 is @xmath50    exactly as in the case of the klein ",
    "gordon equation , we should choose only the positive frequency solutions @xcite .",
    "thus , the wave packet @xmath51 will be normalized by @xmath52 where some hyperplane @xmath53 is chosen .",
    "now we have to quantize the classical equations of motion @xmath54 obtained from the classical hamiltonian @xmath55 by taking poisson brackets @xmath56 , where @xmath57    for quantization it is sufficient to specify commutation relation for operators at initial moment of time @xmath1 . according to the dirac quantization procedure @xcite , besides the hamiltonian constraint @xmath58 ( see ( [ constr1 ] ) ) , we have to set some additional gauge fixing constraint , which can be chosen in our case as @xmath59 , because the hyperplane @xmath53 is chosen earlier for the normalization of the wave function in the klein - gordon style . besides the ordinary poisson brackets the dirac brackets have to be introduced : @xmath60      one has to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq ] ) with the given initial commutation relations . in contract to the ordinary heisenberg operators , the quasi - heisenberg operators do not conserve their commutation relations during evolution .",
    "the commutation relations ( [ rec0 ] ) can be satisfied through @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "variable @xmath72 is @xmath73-number now because it commutes with all operators @xcite .",
    "solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq ] ) are @xmath74    we imply that these quasi - heisenberg operators act in the hilbert space with the klein - gordon scalar product .",
    "expression for the mean value of an observable is @xmath75 where operator @xmath76 ( since @xmath77 the @xmath21-term can be omitted in the expression for @xmath78 ) .",
    "( [ nmm ] ) is particular case of that suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an one - particle picture of the klein - gordon equation in the foldy - wouthausen representation has been considered .",
    "the adequacy of this definition can been seen in the momentum representation of the @xmath79 variable , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "( [ nmm ] ) gives @xmath82 which is similar to the ordinary quantum mechanical definition and certainly possesses hermicity .",
    "evaluation of the mean value @xmath83 given by ( [ oper ] ) , ( [ defali ] ) over the wave packet ( [ pack ] ) reads @xmath84    next quantity is the mean value of the scalar field @xmath85 :    @xmath86 with the index @xmath18 in ( [ canc ] ) mean that @xmath18 is not equal to zero yet ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ defali ] ) ) . a remarkable property of eq .",
    "( [ canc ] ) is that the term @xmath87 cancels the term arising from the differentiation : @xmath88 .",
    "thus , after @xmath89 one can obtain @xmath90 cancellation of the terms divergent under @xmath91 in the mean values of the quasi - heisenberg operators is a general feature of the theory . as a result , it is possible to evaluate , for instance , @xmath92    one should not confuse the divergence at @xmath77 arising under evaluation of the mean values with the singularity at @xmath93 .",
    "the mean values of operators , which are singular at @xmath94 in the classical theory remain singular also in the quantum case . according to ( [ oper ] ) , ( [ nmm ] )",
    "the way to avoid a singularity is to guess , that the universe evolution began from some `` seed '' scale factor @xmath95 .",
    "then in the expression for a mean value , one has to assume @xmath96 instead of @xmath77 .",
    "but , the mathematics is simplified greatly namely at @xmath77 , because the use of asymptotical value of the wave function is possible in this case .    one more kind of the infinity can be found in eqs .",
    "( phi_1 ) , ( [ phi2 ] ) : for @xmath97 , which does not tend to zero at small @xmath98 , the mean values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 diverge .",
    "this is a manifestation of the well - known infrared divergency of scalar field minimally coupled with gravity .",
    "thus , not all possible @xmath97 are suitable for construction of the wave packets .",
    "let us consider hamiltonian , containing the cosmological constant @xmath101 : @xmath102 explicit solution for the wave function @xmath103 has the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the gamma function and @xmath106 is the bessel function .",
    "the wave function ( [ ww ] ) tends to @xmath107 asymptotically under @xmath91 .",
    "then for evaluation of the mean values according to ( [ defali ] ) , we can always build the wave packet @xmath108 from solutions of the free wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation and do not encounter with a problem of negative frequency solutions .",
    "the argumentation holds for any potential @xmath109 , because it contributes into the hamiltonian as a term multiplied by @xmath110 .",
    "equations of motion obtained from the classical hamiltonian ( [ ham_v ] ) are @xmath111 the additional term @xmath112 does not change relations ( [ rec0 ] ) required for the quantization procedure .",
    "only expression for @xmath113 changes in ( [ rec1 ] ) : @xmath114 .",
    "finally we arrive to @xmath115    evaluation of the mean values according to eq .",
    "( [ nmm ] ) leads to @xmath116 one can see , that the dispersion @xmath117 does not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the evolution of universe remains quantum during all time in the model with a cosmological constant .",
    "this results from an absence of some scale length in the model with cosmological constant ( besides the natural plank length ) .",
    "such a length can appear due to some mechanism reducing a cosmological constant during the universe evolution . in the next section one of the possible mechanisms , namely an inflation derived by the quadratic potential of the scalar field , is considered .",
    "[ two ]    as it has been discussed , the quantization procedure consists in quantization of the equations of motion , i.e. considering them as the operator equations .",
    "these equations have to be solved with the initial conditions obeying to the constraint at @xmath1 . for the hamiltonian @xmath118",
    "we have the equations : @xmath119 and the constraint : @xmath120    the point means the differentiation over @xmath2 .",
    "after quantization , eqs .",
    "( [ infl1 ] ) lead to the equations for the quasi - heisenberg operators , which have to be solved with the operator initial conditions : @xmath121 according to our ideology , the operator constraint ( [ conop ] ) is satisfied only at @xmath1 .",
    "the ordinary problem of the operator ordering arises , because the quasi - heisenberg operators are noncommutative in the general case .",
    "the problem seems more transparent if we change the variable @xmath122 : @xmath123 where the symmetric ordering is used .",

    "the solution in analytical form can be found in @xcite .",
    "the analytic solution is important because it allows ensuring that the divergent terms at @xmath77 cancel each other under calculations of the mean values based on ( [ defali ] ) .",
    "however , the most interesting is to consider an inflation at its late stages .",
    "this requires a numerical consideration of the operator equations and can be realized within the framework of the weyl - wigner phase - space formalism @xcite .",
    "let us remind that in this formalism every operator acting on @xmath79 variable has the weyl symbol : @xmath129=a(k,\\phi)$ ] .",

    "the second one is a `` squeezed '' packet having small uncertainty of @xmath98 , but large square of the scalar field : for instance , @xmath156 ( the corresponding winger function is shown in fig .",

    "the main conclusion is that the dispersion of logarithm of the universe scale factor does not vanish during inflation .",
    "even for the wave packet having a large mean value of the scalar field @xmath154 and a small dispersion , one can see ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) the increasing dispersion of the scale factor logarithm during inflation without dispersion decay after the inflation end . in our particular case ( small mass of the scalar field ) , corrections to the equations of motion due to noncommutativity of the quasi - heisenberg operators do not change the picture qualitatively .",

    "cm    as we seen in the previous section , the model with one scalar field provides universe with growing dispersion of the scale factor .",

    "a possible answer is that this occurs due to decoherence .",

    "= 5 . cm    [ stoks ]    it is often stated that the quantum mechanics can not be applied to whole universe , because one has the single universe and is able to perform one measurement .",
    "what is the sense of the scale factor dispersion in this case ?",
    "our suggestion is to consider some local system ( intermediate system for measurements , ims ) inside universe and imply that measurements are carried out under it . denoting the ims degrees of freedom as @xmath167 , one can write lagrangian of the flat , uniform , and isotropic universe including ims :    @xmath168    where @xmath169 is the plank mass , and @xmath26 is the `` volume '' over which the integration in the action ( [ deistv ] ) is doing .",
    "ims is local , i.e. it fills some restricted region of the three - dimensional space which is much smaller than @xmath170 at the moment of time considered .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider @xmath26 to be infinite . as a result ,",
    "the equation of motion for universe ( including @xmath171 ) becomes independent on the ims variables @xmath172 , because the influence of the finite system to the infinite one is negligible ( let us remind that we consider universe with the `` frozen '' local degrees of freedom , implying that some change of universe occurs in the hole space simultaneously ) . from the other hand ,",
    "equations for ims contain @xmath173 as the time - dependent parameter .",
    "after quantization this parameter becomes the operator .",
    "for convenience in the ims description , we can turn to the schrdinger picture and at the same time to consider the scale factor in the quasi - heisenberg picture as before .",
    "thus the ims hamiltonian @xmath174 contains the operator @xmath175 as a parameter .",
    "state of the system is described by the density matrix @xmath176)\\psi(\\xi , t , [ \\hat a])|_a>,\\ ] ] where averaging over the universe state is assumed .",

    "if an observable does not contain the scale factor explicitly , one can find its mean value from the density matrix .",
    "if an observable contains the scale factor , one has to use the wave function and to average over the universe state at the last step .",
    "we can consider a number of imss : our consideration remains valid and the limited number of imss does not influence `` large '' universe . in our model imss can be placed arbitrary close to each other and measurements can be proceeded during the infinitesimal time .",
    "this does not change the measurement results .",
    "let us consider the red shift from the distant sources in the fluctuating universe .",
    "at first , let us note that the fluctuating scale factors does not change the spectral characteristics of the source itself . for example , the hydrogen atom hamiltonian is @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the ims spatial coordinate .",
    "here it is implied that @xmath180 and @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the metric tensor of the three - space .",
    "let us evaluate energies of a `` pure '' state , which is the eigenstate of hamiltonian ( [ hh1 ] ) .",
    "the `` pure '' state depends on the operator of the universe scale factor , which is implied to be time - independent ( adiabatic approximation ) . to find energies we have to rescale the mass and the charge so that @xmath183 and @xmath184 , respectively . then using the ordinary formula @xmath185 one can find that the energies do not change after rescaling .    when one observes the spectrum of an atom from a distant point , the red shifted frequencies are visible in agreement with the formula @xmath186 which is valid for not too large distances @xmath187 .",
    "we can consider the ray of light as a number of ims situated along the ray trajectory .",
    "each of these ims shows different values of the scale factor .",
    "it is equivalent to the ray propagation in the randomly nonuniform media .",
    "since the scale factor is a fluctuating quantity , the additional level width @xmath188 appears besides the broadening of a line due to atom collisions .",
    "above we considered uniform universe . in the general case of universe with the local degrees of freedom ,",
    "one can not neglect a backreaction of the measuring system on universe . the measurement process spoils suggested uniformity . under the measurements carried out under ims ,",
    "the projection of the universe state occurs ( fig .",
    "[ stoks ] , _ a _ ) .",
    "the projection is local , i.e. the universe state is `` spoiled '' only at the local region occupied by ims .",
    "one does not need to consider the multiple universes to build quantum mechanics : every measurements spoil universe only in a local region , and far from this point universe remains almost unchanged and ready for a next measurement .",
    "let us discuss one more sort of measurements .",
    "there exists an opinion @xcite , that the matter degrees of freedom in universe serve as an environment leading to the decoherence of metric .",
    "in other words , we can assume that at some stage of the universe evolution , a `` self measurement '' occurs due to a matter filling universe .",
    "as a result , the scale factor is projected to the different values in the different spatial regions of universe and the nonuniform structure of universe appears ( fig .",
    "[ stoks ] , _ b _ ) .",
    "quantum dispersion of the scale factor turns to dispersion of the scale factor in the different spatial regions ( i.e. the classical dispersion results from the set of measurements ) .",
    "again , this results in an additional broadening of spectral lines .",
    "if a typical size of the scale factor nonuniformity is greater than the size of light source , it is not possible to see an additional line broadening . in this case , another effect like an observation of the hubble constant dispersion in the different directions has to appear . in the case , when the size of the nonuniformity is greater than the observed range of universe , we are not able to detect the spatial scale factor dispersion by the direct experiments .",
    "universe quantum evolution originated from the some fluctuation of the scalar field ( wave packet ) has been considered .",
    "no initial conditions for inflation are needed because all information is contained in the quantum state .",
    "quantization procedure for the equation of motion has been introduced resulting in the quasi - heisenberg operators , which are hermite when the universe wave function normalizes in the klein - gordon style .    for the quadratic inflationary potential",
    ", the numerical calculations have demonstrated that dispersion of logarithm of the scale factor grows during inflation and approaches some constant at the inflation end .",
    "interpretation of this fact can be that the universe scale factor is projected to the differen values within the different spatial regions by the `` self - measurement '' process ( associated with the decoherence ) after inflation .",
    "this results in a highly nonuniform universe .",
    "however , because there is no significant dispersion of the hubble constant measured in a different directions , these spatial regions must have super - hubble size .    in the model with massless scalar field but with the cosmological constant , which decreases with the scale factor growth , we obtain the decreasing dispersion of logarithm of the universe scale factor .",
    "this causes the negligible dispersion after the inflation end without any need of the decoherence .",
    "the authors are grateful to vladimir baryshevsky for clarifying discussions on measurement problem and to konstantin batrakov , eduardo guendelman , alexander kaganovich , victor tikhomirov for the interest to this work .",
