    "quantum dots , quantum wires , and molecular structures are among the most studied low - dimensional condensed matter systems due to their importance to nanoelectronics,@xcite and recently to biology.@xcite in the field of molecular electronics , molecules are used to control the current flow when they are assembled in between metal contacts .",
    "@xcite among the several physical properties exhibited by low - dimensional electron systems , interesting ones can be found in the transport properties of these systems , such as conductance quantization and conductance oscillations,@xcite the latter effect depending on the number of atoms in the wire .",
    "some of these effects have been found in the related field of carbon nanotubes , where experiments have shown that the conductance of a single wall carbon nanotube is quantized@xcite and shows fabry - perot interference patterns , a signature of coherent transport in the carbon wire .",
    "the above systems all fall under the study of low - dimensional physics and are best described starting from the tight - binding approximation .",
    "when we address the physical properties of these low - dimensional systems there are two different questions to address .",
    "one is concerned with the electronic spectrum,@xcite and the other with the transport properties.@xcite the first of these properties is of importance for the optical response of the system and the second for its use in nanoscopic devices .",
    "the need of an efficient method of computing both the spectrum and the conductance of these systems is therefore obvious .",
    "both these problems can be traced back to the calculation of the lattice green s function of the system . in the case of the spectrum",
    ", the green s function should be computed for the isolated system , whereas when considering the transport properties , the green s function must be computed taking into account the effect of the coupling between the system and the metallic leads .",
    "the lattice green s function method was used to describe the appearance of surface modes ( tamm states ) in a finite one - dimensional chain and its interaction with a non - linear impurity .",
    "@xcite the generalization to a semi - infinite square lattice was also discussed .",
    "@xcite several different methods of computing transport properties of one - dimensional quantum wires , using lattice green s functions , are available in the literature . a tutorial overview on some of the used methods was recently written by ryndyk _",
    "et al._.@xcite using the keldysh method , the coherent transport through a one - dimensional lattice was studied by zeng _",
    "et al._.@xcite li _",
    "_ studied the transport through a quantum dot ring with four sites.@xcite the inclusion of time dependent potentials on the transport properties of one - dimensional chains was done by arrachea .",
    "@xcite the inclusion of electron - electron interactions in the transport properties of a small system was discussed by oguri@xcite and of a quantum wire was done by karrach _",
    "et al._,@xcite using a functional renormalization group method .",
    "the extension to a quasi - one - dimensional kagom wire , where the feature of a multiband system is present , was considered by ishii and nakayama.@xcite the interesting situation where the metallic wire is connected to a heisenberg chain was studied by reininghaus _",
    "et al._. @xcite the above results are just a very small subset of the existing representative literature on quantum transport , where the concept of lattice green s function plays a central role .",
    "historically , the first approach to electronic transport in a one - dimensional finite system was done in a series of elegant papers published by caroli _",
    "et al._. in these works the authors addressed the question of how defects affect the charge transport of the quantum wire .",
    "indeed , the question of how localized defects change the otherwise perfect transport properties of the system has been addressed by several authors in the framework of tight - binding systems .",
    "@xcite    guinea and vergs @xcite used a green s function method to study the local density of states and the localization length of a one - dimensional chain coupled to small pieces of a polymer .",
    "they showed that at the band center there is a complete suppression of the transmission coefficient due to a local antiresonance .",
    "sautet and joachim @xcite studied the effect of a single impurity on the transport properties of a one - dimensional chain .",
    "the impurity was assumed to change both the on - site energy and the hopping to the next - neighbor atoms .",
    "mizes and conwell @xcite considered the effect of a single impurity in two coupled - chains , showing that a change on the on - site energy has a more pronounced effect in reducing the transmission in the one - dimensional chain than it has in this system .",
    "finally , peres and sols studied analytically the effect of a localized defect in the transport properties of polyacene ( a multi - band system ) , putting in evidence a parity effect , that was also used by akhmerov _ _ et al.__@xcite to formulate a theory of the valley - valve effect in graphene nanoribbons.@xcite also the study of vacancies in transport of quasi - two - dimensional systems is an important area of research.@xcite the study of a linear array of quantum dots , represented by a single site with an @xmath0orbital was carried out by teng _",
    "et al._.@xcite    the book by ferry and goodnick has a very good introductory section to lattice green s functions.@xcite also the recursive green s function method is there presented .",
    "the method we present in this paper has strong similarities to the recursive green s function method.@xcite the important difference to stress here is that the recursive green s function method is implemented as a numerical method , whereas our approach does solve the same type of problems in an analytical way .",
    "the link between green s functions and transport properties of nanostructures and mesoscopic systems is well covered in the book by datta.@xcite    in this work we give a detailed account of a method , based on the solution of the dyson equation , to compute the lattice green s function of an array of quantum dots , where the dot is represented by an arbitrary number of sites with arbitrary values of the site energies and of the hopping parameters .",
    "the method is developed within the approximation that there is only one hopping channel between the dots in the array .",
    "this constrain is used to keep the level of the formalism at its minimum . the formalism is easily generalized to include the effect of defects ( both on - site and adatoms defects ) and to describe the transport properties of both the clean and the perturbed system .",
    "the method exploits the fact that the dyson equation for the lattice green s function can be solved exactly for bilinear problems as long as the hoppings are not of arbitrary long range .",
    "also the developed formalism can be used to describe surface states and non - linear impurities effects@xcite in a finite array of quantum dots , but we will not pursue these two aspects in this paper . although developed within a quasi - one - dimensional perspective , we will show in a forthcoming publication how the method can be generalized to two - dimensional ribbons .",
    "in this section we develop a general method for determining the green s function of an array of quantum dots . from it both the electronic spectrum and the rule for momentum quantization are obtained . as a warming up we first revisit the solution of the finite chain problem .    the traditional approach@xcite to determine the green s function in real space requires the previous solution of the schrdinger equation , with the corresponding determination of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "after this is done , the green s function is computed using @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the eigenproblem @xmath4 , where @xmath5 stands for the hamiltonian of the problem and the summation over @xmath6 means a discrete sum ( for discrete eigenvalues),or an integration ( for continuous eigenvalues ) , or both , over the quantum numbers of the problem .",
    "the evaluation of the sum in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) may be a very hard task , depending on the mathematical complexity of both the wave functions and the eigenvalues .",
    "even for relatively simple cases the evaluation of the summation is far from obvious ( see appendices of ref . ) .",
    "an alternative approach , used for lattice systems , starts from the definition of the resolvent operator @xmath7 and computes the matrix elements of the resolvent by evaluating directly a number of determinants associated with the matrix @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite this method has the obvious drawback of being limited by the possibility of computing analytically the necessary determinants .",
    "we present in what follows a method that overcomes the technical difficulties above mentioned .      in order to understand how the method works , we revisit the problem of determining the green s function of a finite one - dimensional chain of atoms , with a single orbital per atom .",
    "this simple example will help us to fix the notation and state the general arguments about the solution of this type of problems .",
    "let us assume that the system has @xmath9 atoms , with the motion of the electrons described by the tight - binding hamiltonian    @xmath10    with @xmath11 and @xmath12 clearly , eq . ( [ h0 ] ) represents the on - site energy of the electrons in the atoms and eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) represents the hopping of the electrons between neighboring atoms .",
    "this may seem as an important restriction , but it can in fact be relaxed and the approach extended to more general hopping processes .",
    "@xcite alternatively the green s function of a more complex hamiltonian may be generated using the _ extension theory _ for lattice green s functions .",
    "@xcite    let us now introduce two different resolvent operators , the free resolvent @xmath13 and the full resolvent @xmath14 , given by eq .",
    "( [ resolv ] ) with @xmath5 given by eq .",
    "( [ h1d ] ) .",
    "the strategy is to determine @xmath14 by solving exactly dyson s equation,@xcite considering the hopping term @xmath15 as perturbation . in terms of the resolvents and of @xmath15 ,",
    "the dyson equation takes the form @xmath16 forming matrix elements with the basis vectors and using @xmath17 , one obtains @xmath18 with @xmath19 . apart from the term @xmath20 , this is the equation for the wavefunction of a particle of coordinate @xmath21 with the tight binding hamiltonian ( [ h1d ] ) , and eigenvalue @xmath22 .",
    "it is obvious that the difference of two solutions of this equation will be a solution of the equation without the @xmath20 term .",
    "so @xmath23 can be determined by adding a general solution of the homogeneous equation to _ one _ particular solution of the full equation .",
    "the latter can then be determined by the boundary conditions .",

    "it is worth noticing that the rule for momentum quantization ( that is @xmath27 ) is obtained from the poles of the green s function ( [ gsol ] ) , leading to @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",

    "we give two other derivations of the green s function of a finite chain which treats both coordinates equally from the beginning .",
    "we now consider the case where @xmath9 quantum dots , represented by hexagons in fig .",

    "although having just a single hopping channel between the dots may seem rather restrictive , we used it nevertheless to illustrate the method . also , if we choose to position the dot in such a way that is has oriented edges such that a particular site of the dot is closer to the next dot than any other point , as in the case of fig .",
