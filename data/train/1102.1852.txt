    "in the simulation of statistical models , many monte carlo methods experience a significant increase in effort when approaching a continuous phase transition of the theory .",

    "algorithms have been found which completely eliminate this slowing down or even lead to a speed - up when the critical line is approached .",
    "a particular type of critical slowing down is associated with the topological modes of the theories . in qcd , e.g. , the topological charge of the gauge configuration is known to be particularly problematic with both single link updates @xcite and algorithms based on molecular dynamics @xcite .",

    "also the accuracy to which the differential equations have to be integrated is unknown .    in this letter",

    "most importantly , the accuracy achievable in this two dimensional model is much higher than in qcd and the reduced cost also allows for a better mapping of the rather high dimensional parameter space of the problem .    in sect .",

    ", we show the autocorrelation function of the magnetic susceptibility at @xmath159 for the hmc algorithm in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . at the beginning",
    ", it falls quickly to @xmath160 but then develops a very long tail , a situation already described in ref .",
    "the tail is compatible with a single exponential with a time constant equal to the exponential autocorrelation time extracted from @xmath161 .",
    "this is indicated in the figure by the dashed lines .",
    "we can use this information for an improved estimate of the autocorrelation time@xcite .",
    "the usual sum of @xmath162 in only performed up to the point where the single exponential tail starts .",
    "the rest of the sum is substituted by the integral over the single exponential for which the largest observed time constant observed in all observables with the same parity is taken . in our situation",
    "this is @xmath163 .",
    "since the hmc obeys detailed balance , this gives a strict upper bound for @xmath107 , provided that there are no modes which suffer from an even slower evolution .",
    "also for the correlation length and at @xmath164 a similar behavior can be observed . even though the coefficients might seem small",
    ", the slow modes still have a sizable contribution because of the very large time constant . at @xmath159 ,",
    "this tail contributes roughly 30% to @xmath165 and 50% to @xmath166 ; for @xmath164 the contribution of the tail is roughly 10% and 17% , respectively .",
    "the values of the autocorrelation time from estimating the contribution of the tail in this way lie within the @xmath167 error of the values given in table  [ tab : ac ] obtained by a summation to large values of @xmath101 . in case of @xmath168 ,",
    "the improved estimator is significantly higher than the value obtained from the truncated sum .",
    "the single exponential dominates from @xmath169 , contributing roughly 10% ( 50% ) at @xmath164 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "we take the different values as upper and lower bounds and state the discrepancy as systematic error in table  [ tab : ac ] .",
    "if the true value is close to the upper bound , the scaling of @xmath168 deviates from a power law already at @xmath143 .",
    "if we assume that the exponential growth in the time constant is not compensated by the decrease in the coefficient , this contribution will be even more pronounced when @xmath117 is increased further .",
    "we finally come to the comparison between the hmc and thmc algorithm , and we show the reduction in autocorrelation time achieved through the introduction of the field transformation . in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] we plot the ratio of the autocorrelation of our observables for the two algorithms .",
    "the correlation length and the magnetic susceptibility for which we observe a 40% reduction profit most from the field transformation . for the topology",
    "roughly a 25% reduction is found , the energy is almost unaffected , however , it shows a quite short @xmath107 over the whole range of data .",
    "note that for @xmath143 and @xmath170 the reduction of @xmath168 has to be taken with care due to its systematic uncertainty .",
    "all critical exponents of the thmc algorithm extracted from the range @xmath136 agree within uncertainties with the ones of hmc .",
    "also the deviation from the scaling law at @xmath143 and @xmath170 is observed .",
    "the exponential behavior of @xmath158 is compatible with hmc within error bars as well .",
    "we can conclude that the field transformation does not affect the scaling of these variables in the investigated region .    as commented above , the improvement factor which we find",
    "is close to the additional cost of the simulation and therefore the two algorithms perform rather similarly .",
    "these findings do not seem to depend strongly on @xmath6 , since we also did limited simulations in the cp@xmath171 , with essentially equal results .",
    "whether a modification to an algorithm actually improves its performance is often very difficult to predict .",
    "it therefore needs numerical simulations to study its effects .",
    "here we investigated recently proposed field transformations which can lead to a speed - up in hmc simulations .",
    "unfortunately , the result is negative .",
    "although we observe a reduction in autocorrelation times , the scaling towards the continuum limit is not improved .",
    "the reduction in the forces , which can be used to increase the step size of the molecular dynamics integration , is compensated by the computational overhead of the method . however",
    ", this conclusion does not have to be universally true for all theories .",
    "in qcd with dynamical fermions , e.g. , the computational cost of the construction would be a minor part of the whole cost of the simulation .",
    "investigating the pure hmc algorithm serves also as an illustration that exponentially slow modes will at some point affect other observables of the theory .",
    "the deviation at @xmath172 from the scaling behavior , which we observe for the observables up to a correlation length of 12 , is therefore a cautionary tale for qcd simulations .",
    "even though the slow mode observed in the topological charge might not seem to have any influence on other observables in today s simulations@xcite , at some point , the correlation to the topological charge can also affect the scaling behavior towards the continuum limit in these channels .",
    "the calculations have been performed on local clusters at zid at the university of graz .",
    "we thank the institution for providing support .",
    "we are indebted to christof gattringer and martin lscher for very valuable comments on a previous version of the paper and to francesco virotta for providing us with software for the analysis of autocorrelation functions",
