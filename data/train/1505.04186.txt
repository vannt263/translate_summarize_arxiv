    "it is widely known that fading is an effect that significantly degrades communication signals during wireless propagation .",
    "a common approach for accounting for this phenomenon has been viable through exploitation of appropriate statistical distributions . to this effect",
    ", statistical models such as rayleigh , nagakami - m , weibull and nakagami - q ( hoyt ) have been shown to be capable of modelling small - scale fading in non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) communication scenarios whereas nakagami-@xmath1 ( rice ) distribution has been typically utilized in characterizing multipath fading in line - of - sight ( los ) communication scenarios , @xcite and the references therein . capitalizing on the these models , m. d. yacoub proposed three generalised fading models , namely , the @xmath2 , the @xmath0 , the @xmath3 models and subsequently the @xmath4 and the @xmath0 extreme models , @xcite .",
    "these models have been proved particularly useful due to the remarkable flexibility offered by their named parameters which render them capable of providing adequate fittings to results obtained by field measurements .",
    "their usefulness is also evident by the fact that they include as special cases all the above small - scale fading distributions .",
    "+ it is recalled here that a fundamental principle of wireless radio propagation is that multipath and shadowing effects occur simultaneously . as a result , in spite of the undoubted usefulness of the aforementioned fading models , they all ultimately fail to account concurrently for both shadowing and multipath fading . in other words ,",
    "the characterisation offered by the aforementioned fading models is limited to modelling either the one or the other effect .",
    "based on this crucial limitation , the need for composite statistical models that can provide adequate characterization of the fading effect as a whole , became necessary @xcite .",
    "+ motivated by this , the authors in @xcite proposed the rayleigh / gamma fading model , which is also known as @xmath5-distibution , @xmath6 . in the same context ,",
    "shankar in @xcite exploited the flexibility of nakagami-@xmath7 distribution , which includes rayleigh distribution as a special case , and introduced the nakagami-@xmath7/gamma composite distribution - or generalised @xmath5-distribution , @xmath8 .",
    "likewise , the weibull / gamma composite distribution was proposed in @xcite while an introduction to generalised composite fading models was reported by the authors in @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this work is the derivation of novel analytic results for the @xmath0/gamma and the @xmath0 extreme / gamma composite fading distributions . in more details , after formulating these models , novel analytic expressions are derived for their corresponding envelope and power probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "the validity of the offered expressions is justified through comparisons with results obtained from numerical integrations while their behaviour is assessed under different parametric scenarios .",
    "importantly , owing to the relatively simple algebraic representation of the offered expressions , they can be considered useful mathematical tools that can be efficiently utilized in studies related to the performance analysis of digital communications over @xmath0/gamma and @xmath0 extreme / gamma composite fading channels . to this end , they can be exclusively employed in the derivation of analytic expressions for various performance measures such as error probability , channel capacity and higher order statistics , among others .",
    "+ the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : section ii revisits the basic principles of the @xmath0 , the @xmath0 extreme and the gamma distributions .",
    "subsequently , sections iii and iv are devoted to the formulation and derivation of the @xmath0/gamma and @xmath0 extreme / gamma fading models , respectively , along with the necessary analysis on their behaviour .",
    "finally , discussions on the potential applicability of the derived expressions in wireless communications along with closing remarks are given in section v.",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is a fading model that accounts for the small - scale variations of the fading signal in a line - of - sight ( los ) communication scenario and it is written in terms of two physical parameters , namely @xmath10 and @xmath9 . in terms of physical interpretation , the former parameter is related to the multipath clustering whereas the latter denotes the ratio between the total power of the dominant components and the total power of the scattered waves , @xcite . according to @xcite , for a fading signal with envelope @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the @xmath0 envelope pdf is given by ,",
    "@xmath13    where @xmath14 denotes expectation and @xmath15 is the root - mean - square @xmath16 value of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath17 function denotes the modified bessel function of the first kind and order @xmath1 whereas the terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 are obtained by @xcite    @xmath20    which is valid for non - negative values .",
    "as already mentioned , the @xmath21 distribution constitutes a particularly flexible multipath fading model since it includes as special cases the widely known nakagami - n ( rice ) , nakagami - m , rayleigh and one - side gaussian distributions , @xcite .",
    "+      the @xmath0 extreme distribution emerges as a notable special case of the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "specifically , it is firstly recalled that all the aforementioned multipath models refer exclusively to conditions involving large numbers of paths which ultimately meet the principle of central limit theorem ( clt ) .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown recently that the occurrence of large number of paths , is not typically the case in wireless radio propagation over enclosed environments such as aeroplanes , trains and buses @xcite .",
    "the reason underlying this is that such environments are known to be characterised by only a few number of paths . as a consequence , severe fading conditions , even worse than rayleigh ,",
    "are ultimately constituted @xcite .",
    "+ by recalling @xcite , the nakagami parameter @xmath7 is regarded as the inverse of the variance of the normalized power of the fading signal and is related to the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 by the following relationship ,    @xmath22    at this point , the @xmath0 extreme distribution is obtained by keeping @xmath7 constant , assuming @xmath23 and considering a very strong los , i.e. @xmath24 , and very few multipaths , i.e. @xmath25 . as a result , equation reduces to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 16 ) ) , namely ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 while @xmath28 denotes the dirac delta function .",
    "+      it is recalled that log - normal distribution has been regarded the optimum statistical model for characterising the shadowing effect , @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of its usefulness , it has been largely shown that when it is involved in combination with other elementary and/or special function , its algebraic representation becomes intractable .",
    "this is particularly the case in studies related to the analytical derivation of critical performance measures in the field of digital communications over fading channels .",
    "motivated by this , the authors in @xcite proposed the gamma distribution as an accurate substitute to log - normal distribution .",
    "mathematically , the envelope pdf of gamma distribution is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 4 ) ) , namely ,    @xmath29    where the term @xmath30 is its shaping parameter and @xmath31 .",
    "the gamma fading model has been shown to provide adequate fitting to experimental data that correspond to realistic fading conditions .",
    "in addition , it is evident that its algebraic representation is quite tractable and therefore , easy to handle both analytically and numerically . as a result , it has been undoubtedly useful in characterising shadowing and for this reason it has been exploited in the formulation of the @xmath5 and @xmath32 composite multipath / shadowing models , @xcite .",
    "according to the basic principles of statistics , the envelope pdf of a composite statistical distribution is deduced by means of superimpose of two or more statistical distributions . in the present case , this is realized by superimposing one multipath and one shadowing distribution . in mathematical terms , this principle is expressed as ,    @xmath33    where @xmath34 denotes the corresponding multipath distribution with mode @xmath35 . based on this principle , the corresponding @xmath0/gamma composite fading distribution is formulated by firstly setting @xmath36 and @xmath37 in and substituting in along with equation . to this end",
    ", it follows immediately that    @xmath38    importantly , the term @xmath39 in has emerged from the term @xmath40 which denotes that the mean - squared value of the fading amplitude is gamma distributed .",
    "however , it is noted here that it can be also assumed that the root - mean - squared value of the fading amplitude is gamma distributed .",
    "in fact , this is precisely the difference between the rayleigh / lognormal and suzuki fading models since in the former the @xmath41 value of the fading amplitude is modelled as being log - normal whereas in the latter it is the mean - squared value of this amplitude which is assumed to be log - normal @xcite . as a result , by applying this principle in , one obtains    @xmath42      the derivation of an analytic expression for the envelope pdf of the @xmath0 distribution is subject to evaluation of the integral in . to this end , it is recalled the the @xmath43 function can be equivalently represented in terms of the infinite series in ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 8.445 ) ) , and the polynomial approximation in ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 19 ) ) , namely ,    @xmath44    therefore , by making the necessary change of variables , one obtains straightforwardly , the polynomial approximation reduces to the infinite series . ]",
    "@xmath45    subsequently , by recalling that @xmath46 and substituting in into , it follows immediately that    @xmath47 @xmath48 importantly , the above integral can be expressed in closed - form according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 3.471.9 ) ) , namely ,    @xmath49    where @xmath50 denotes the modified bessel function of the second kind , @xcite .",
    "therefore , by performing the necessary variable transformation in and substituting in yields the following explicit expression :    @xmath51    where @xmath28 is the dirac delta function and @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , the notation @xmath53 denotes a normalisation scalar constant that needs to be determined so that holds as a true pdf . to this end , by recalling that @xmath54 , it immediately follows that    @xmath55    notably , the above integral can be expressed in closed - form according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 6.561.16 ) ) .",
    "based on this , the constant @xmath53 can be finally expressed as :    @xmath56    therefore , by substituting into , an explicit expression for the envelope pdf of the @xmath0 fading distribution is deduced , namely ,    @xmath57    which to the best of the authors knowledge is novel .",
    "the corresponding power pdf of the @xmath0 distribution is straightforwardly deduced by making use of the relationship : @xmath58 . to this effect",
    ", it follows that    @xmath59    importantly , the algebraic form of the above expressions is relatively convenient to handle both analytically and numerically .",
    "this is particularly useful in deriving analytic expressions for various performance measures in telecommunications where the pdf of fading distributions is often involved in complex integrals combined with other elementary and/or special functions .",
    "as already mentioned , the @xmath0 extreme fading model constitute a special case of the @xmath0 distribution and it accounts for severe fading conditions that typically occur in enclosed environments .",
    "likewise the @xmath0 distribution , the @xmath0 extreme distribution does not account for the simultaneous occurrence of shadowing .",
    "therefore , by following the same procedure as in the formulation of the @xmath0/gamma distribution , the corresponding @xmath0 extreme / gamma multipath / shadowing composite fading model is formulated . to this end",
    ", equation is equivalently expressed as :    @xmath60    next , by setting @xmath61 and considering that the ( rms ) of the the fading amplitude is gamma distributed , the @xmath15 term in is represented by @xmath35 .",
    "hence , by substituting on along with , it follows that the @xmath0 extreme / gamma distribution is given by :    @xmath62      the second integral in is expressed in closed - form in terms of the gamma function . as a result",
    ", it follows that    @xmath63    the modified bessel function in @xmath64 can be re - written according to ( * ? ? ?",

    "+ notably , the @xmath64 integral has the same algebraic form as the @xmath67 integral in and therefore in , ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 3.471.9 ) ) .",
    "to this effect , by making the necessary change of variables and substituting in yields the following analytic expression :    @xmath68   x^{b + l + \\frac{1}{2 } } k _ { b -l - \\frac{1}{2}}\\left(2x\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\omega } } \\right ) + s\\ ] ]    by recalling that @xmath69 , it follows that    @xmath70   \\int_{0}^{\\infty}x^{b + l + \\frac{1}{2 } } k _ { b -l - \\frac{1}{2}}\\left(2x\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\omega } } \\right)dx\\ ] ]    which with the aid of ( * ? ? ?",

    "figure @xmath83 demonstrates the envelope pdf of the @xmath0 extreme /gamma distribution for @xmath84 , @xmath85 and different values of the nakagami parameter @xmath7 .",
    "one can observe the flexibility of the proposed models which , as already mentioned , render them capable of providing adequate fittings to experimental results .",
    "it is widely known that the algebraic representation of crucial performance measures is critical in studies related to analytical performance evaluation of digital communications .",
