    ". there are five different steps .",
    "* first , all the array images were flatfielded , corrected for cosmic rays and for distortions along the axis of dispersion .",
    "the sky emission was removed using the chopping technique ( offered for isaac ) combined with telescope nodding .",
    "the chopper throw distance was 20 arcsec along the slit .",
    "each chopped frame is composed of a positive trace image and a negative one ( see an example in fig .  [ data_reduc1 ] ) .",
    "telescope nodding results in two consecutive chopped frames a and b shifted 20 arcsec relative to each other .",
    "the shift distance is equal to the chopper throw , such that the positive trace image in the first image a is located at the same location on the array as the negative one in image b ( see example in fig .",
    "[ data_reduc1 ] ) .",
    "thus , subtracting one chopped frame from the second ( a - b ) results in an image with two negative traces and one positive trace with twice the intensity of the negative ones ( see fig .  [ data_reduc1 ] ) .",
    "the goal of this subtraction is to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and to remove the sky emission lines from the spectra .",
    "* in the second step , we extracted spectra of the bright sources from all the frames and wavelength calibrated them using a xenon - argon lamp and the third order grating .",
    "then , we made a relative flux calibration of the spectra and corrected them for telluric lines using a0v - type standard stars and the data reduction commands from iraf software .",
    "the procedure to remove telluric lines is to divide the extracted science spectrum by a modified telluric standard spectrum .",
    "the modified spectrum is the standard star spectrum shifted in wavelength to correct for possible errors in the zeropoint dispersion and scaled in intensity ( following an exponential law that involves a scaling parameter to correct for airmass deviations ) . the optimal `` shift '' and `` scale '' parameters ( x@xmath20 and s@xmath20 in the illustration of fig .",
    "[ data_reduc2 ] , respectively ) obtained during the telluric lines correction are stored for each of the extracted spectra of a single frame .",
    "telluric standard stars were observed as close to the corresponding airmass at which the galactic centre was observed as possible .",
    "hence we minimized the possibility of calibration uncertainties due to the fact that the sky lines can be narrower than our spectral resolution elements .",
    "* in the third step , for each science frame , the mean value of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters is calculated on all extracted spectra ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ data_reduc3 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to build a modified telluric star spectrum shifted and scaled with the optimal parameters allowing us to correct all the spectra of a single science frame at a time .",
    "the resulting shifted and scaled star spectrum is then stacked along the slit axis 1024 times , corresponding to the number of detector pixels ( see example in fig .",
    "[ data_reduc3 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we will call the resulting image a stacked standard star frame . *",
    "the fourth step is to divide each of the science frames flatfielded , corrected for cosmic rays , distorsions and sky lines , by its corresponding stacked standard star frame .",
    "this allows an optimal correction for telluric lines of all spectra in the totality of the science frames without extracting the spectra ( see example in fig .  [ data_reduc4 ] ) .",
    "the reduced science frames corresponding to the same slit position were then added to each other to improve the s / n .",
    "this results in one final reduced frame per slit position . * in the final step , we constructed the data cube using dpuser software by positioning properly the resulting 22 slit frames ( see fig .",
    "[ data_reduc5 ] ) . to this end ,",
    "the different slit frames were shifted adequately along the slit axis ( i.e. along the declination axis ) to recover the observed field with the right relative positions of the bright sources .",
    "the right ascension axis is obtained by positioning the 22 slit frames correctly next to each others .",

    "we could , therefore , assume that this star is not affected by the local absorption and that the @xmath2co absorption observed in its m - band spectrum is mainly due to the line - of - sight extinction .",

    "this map is obtained considering the theoretical ratio of 1.05 between the optical depths of the @xmath2co  p(1 ) and @xmath2co  p(2 ) lines .",

    "+ from the values of the optical depths obtained in this map , we can derive the residual column densities of the co ice absorption using the equation ( sandford et al .",

    "if we measure the fwhm of the band in the template spectrum we get 6 to 7 @xmath60 @xmath64 m and if we assume the same value for the residuals , we can calculate the residual column densities @xmath65 . from fig .",
    "[ tausolid ] , we find optical depth values of the @xmath66 band ranging from 0 to @xmath90.6 - 0.7 , this implies column densities @xmath65 of 0 to 21 - 24 @xmath67 cm@xmath13 .",
    "typically , the @xmath2co to h@xmath69 abundance ratios in dense molecular clouds are of the order of [ @xmath2co]/[h@xmath69 ] = 8 10@xmath71 , hence the associated n(h@xmath69 ) range from 0 to @xmath72 cm@xmath13 .",
    "thus , if we consider only the molecular column density associated with the observed co ice and the a@xmath73/n(h@xmath69 ) ratio of 1 to 2  10@xmath74 ( bohlin et al .",
    "1978 , moneti et al . 2001 ) , we get a visible residual extinction a@xmath73 of 3 to 5 mag across the region .",
    "this means that the residual co ice is larger than the assumed variation of the foreground extinction derived by schdel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) @xmath75 ( corresponding to @xmath76 mag if we assume the extinction law of martin & whittet 1990 and @xmath77 assuming the law by rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",

    "this implies large amounts of dust in the regions also observed in the mid - infrared data by viehmann et al .",
    "this region is also very bright in the @xmath3co  r(0 ) optical depth map of fig .",
    "[ od13corrcont ] .",
    "+ the high values in optical depths of the gas for the irs13-irs2 sources go along with the deep residual ice absorption .",

    "our mapping covers the region in which most of the continuum emission from the minispiral is observed in millimetre maps ( see kunneriath et al .",
    "the constructed field is very successful with an accuracy of the relative source position recovery of the order of 1 arcsec . + we derived a first - order line - of - sight template extinction spectrum .",
    "the extinction is partly due to obscuration by dust and partly to absorption by the @xmath2co ice that forms on dust grains of the ism .",
    "we , then , corrected the data cube for this first approximation foreground extinction .",
    "+ the resulting data cube shows residuals of the 4.675@xmath0 m absorption in the region suggesting that large amounts of co ices are present in the central region .",
    "however , we do not exclude the possibility that the residuals can be due to larger variations of the foreground band extinction than currently admitted .",
    "+ on the other hand , from the resulting data cube , we derived optical depth maps of the @xmath3co  r(0 ) gaseous line and corrected it for the assumed foreground gaseous absorption .",
    "we found residual @xmath3co lines in the final map .",
    "given the shape of the theoretical gaseous co line complex , one may expect residuals of cold co with temperatures as low as 10k .",
    "+ these results provide additional evidence to those shown by moultaka et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) , that very low temperatures might be present near the central black hole .",
    "these low temperatures may conflict with the physical conditions of the local environment .",
    "indeed , the central parsec proved to be a very complex medium where seem to coexist the warm dust of the minispiral ( @xmath9200k ) and hot gas of the supernova remnant sgra east , the strong winds and tidal forces of sgra@xmath1 , as well as high ionizing fluxes and stellar winds from the local early - type stars .",
    "however , within this complexity , one can also observe high density pockets suggested by the dusty filaments observed by mu@xmath8i et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) and the dust embedded sources that form bowshock shapes due to their interaction with the interstellar material ( tanner et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "the presence of such high - density regions preventing the ices to be destroyed as well as the fact that the travel time of molecular cloudlets in the central parsec is of the order of their lifetime of about @xmath78 yr ( van loon & oliveira 2003 , mellema et al . 1998 ) favours the required conditions for cold gas and ices to survive the passage through the central stellar cluster ( i.e. as a transient phenomenon ) .",
    "+ even though we demonstrate that low temperatures can survive in the local environment of the galactic centre , we can not discard the possibility that the residual ices and cold gases that we observe in the present data are the signature of a more varying line - of - sight extinction .",
    "such a variable line - of - sight extinction is not obvious in the data by goto et al .",
    "( 2014 ) since only two sources were observed through the @xmath3co  r(0 ) gaseous line .",
