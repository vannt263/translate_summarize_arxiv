    "as part of the mess ( mass loss of evolved stars ) herschel guaranteed time key program ( pi martin groenewegen ) we are observing a sample of planetary nebulae ( pne ) in photometric and/or spectroscopic mode with the pacs ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the aims of the mess program are threefold .",
    "1 ) study the time dependence of the mass loss process via a search for shells and multiple shells .",
    "2 ) study the dust and gas chemistry as a function of progenitor mass .",
    "3 ) study the properties and asymmetries of a representative sample of evolved objects .",

    "[ tab1 ] we present an overview of the herschel observations that have been taken or are planned for the pne in our sample .",
    "all targets have been imaged in scan map ( sm ) mode , except ngc 7293 which was observed in parallel mode ( pm ) . with pacs",
    "we have obtained images in the 70 and 160 @xmath0 m bands ( beam size : 5.2  and 12 , respectively ) , with spire we have obtained all 3 bands : 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath0 m ( beam size : 18.1 , 25.2 , and 36.6 , respectively ) . for all spectroscopic targets we obtain full spectral scans , covering the wavelength range 5198 + 103192 @xmath0 m for pacs and 196667 @xmath0 m for spire .",
    "below we will discuss preliminary results of selected objects of our sample .    .",
    "this pn ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6720 ] ) is very similar to ngc 7293 ( the helix nebula ) .",
    "it seems they follow the same evolutionary path .",
    "the helix nebula has very strong h@xmath1 emission ( * ? ? ?",

    "a static photoionization model can not explain this emission , but a hydrodynamic model can ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "this model indicates that the erosion of the knots by the radiation field of the central star is substantial : between 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3 m@xmath4yr@xmath5 despite the low luminosity of the central star ( 120  l@xmath4 ) .",
    "considering the fact that the central star luminosity was much higher in the past and the knots must have been closer to the central star , survival of the knots from the agb phase ( as was e.g. proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* matsuura et al . 2009 ) ) to the current time seems problematic",
    ". however , more detailed modeling is warranted .",
    "we have developed a photoionization model of the ring nebula with cloudy , last described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ferland et al . ( 1998 ) ) , which we used to investigate possible formation scenarios for h@xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that the most plausible scenario is that the h@xmath1 resides in high density knots which were formed after the recombination of the gas started when the central star luminosity dropped steeply around 1000 - 2000 years ago .",
    "the models show that h@xmath1 formation in the knots is expected to be substantial since then , and may well still be ongoing at this moment . for",

    "[ fig650 ] we show the pacs 70 and 160 @xmath0 m and spire 250 @xmath0 m images , as well as the temperature map of the dust created from the pacs 70  / 160 @xmath0 m ratio image , after convolution to the same point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the black contours are taken from the pacs 70 @xmath0 m image to indicate the position of the torus .",
    "the shadowing effect of the torus is clearly visible : the regions at the outer edge of the torus and beyond are clearly cooler than the dust in other directions .",
    "the dust grains are primarily heated by uv photons , either emitted by the central star , or diffuse emission from the gas ( e.g. , ly@xmath6 photons ) . hence there must be substantial extinction of uv photons inside the torus , despite the rather low density of these regions ( 140400 @xmath7 , ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is clear that there is a strong correlation between the high - density regions and the colder dust .",

    "oxygen - rich molecules can be formed because the harsh radiation field keeps co partially dissociated throughout the photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) .    using the photoionization code cloudy we have created a preliminary model of the ionized region and the pdr of ngc 7027 . using either a constant density or a constant pressure density law",
    ", we could not produce a satisfactory fit to both the ionized region and the pdr .",
    "if on the other hand we use a piecewise constant density law with different densities in the ionized region and the pdr , we get a much better fit .",
    "this model indicates that the density in the pdr is much higher than in the ionized region ( 7.9@xmath1110@xmath12 and 3.3@xmath1110@xmath13 @xmath7 , respectively ) .",
    "this density contrast is the result of the heating by the photoionization process , causing the gas to expand . from our modeling efforts",
    "it becomes clear that the gas can not be in pressure equilibrium .",
    "for most pne we see a detailed match between the fir dust emission and the h@xmath1 emission , showing that the dust and h@xmath1 are closely associated . in the case of ngc 6720",
    "this close association provides the first observational evidence for h@xmath1 formation on oxygen - rich dust grains in an astrophysical environment . using cloudy models",
    "we conclude that the most likely scenario is that in ngc 6720 h@xmath1 formed ( and may still be forming now ) inside dense knots that started to form after recombination of the nebula started 1000 - 2000 years ago .",
    "we produced temperature maps from the pacs 70  / 160 @xmath0 m ratio images which show a rich structure .",
    "they indicate that internal extinction in the uv is important , despite the highly evolved status of the nebulae .",
    "many molecules were detected in the spectra of ngc 7027 and ngc 6302 .",
    "a preliminary cloudy photoionization / pdr model of ngc 7027 indicates that the pdr has higher density than the ionized region and the nebula is not in pressure equilibrium ."
