    "in the last two decades , it has become clear that most local spheroidal galaxy components ( elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies ) contain a super massive black hole ( smbh ) in their centres .",
    "the proportionality between black hole ( bh ) and spheroid mass suggests a direct link between the growth of the black hole as an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and the stellar mass of the spheroid ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . identifying the main mechanisms for formation and evolution of galaxies , and their interrelation to that of the growth of their central black holes is a major issue in astrophysics and cosmology .    in the last decade ,",
    "deep surveys at submillimetre ( submm ) and millimetre ( mm ) wavelengths have identified a high - redshift population of massive dusty galaxies that are undergoing extreme starbursts . since prodigious star formation ( sf ) is often obscured by dust , these galaxies are luminous in the mm though far - infrared ( fir ) wavebands where the starlight absorbed by dust grains is re - emitted .",
    "likewise , the hotter dust heated in the circumnuclear environment of an agn will emit at mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths .",
    "therefore , submm and mir observations can be combined to study activity in galaxies due to dust - obscured starbursts and agn .",
    "the launch of the _ herschel space observatory _",
    "data @xcite allow obtaining more accurate and deeper measurements in the fir , permitting better determinations of the luminosity due to sf ( @xmath12 ) and hence the sfr . in recent years there have been many studies in which the sfr was compared with the growth of the central bh ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) with conflicting results about the relationship between agn luminosity and @xmath12 .    in this paper , we have studied a sample of x - ray - obscured qsos , described by @xcite and @xcite , and studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( 20 unabsorbed objects ) , at z@xmath131 - 3 when most of the sf and bh growth are occurring in the universe .",
    "@xcite found six detections at @xmath14 significance at 850@xmath15 m ( scuba ) .",
    "these qsos have strong submm emission , much higher than typically found in qsos at similar redshifts and luminosities .",
    "however for one of them ( rx  j110431.75 + 355208.5 ) a synchrotron origin for the detected 850@xmath15 m emission can not be ruled out , so we have not followed up rx  j110431.75 in this work , and our sample consists of the other five sources .",

    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray spectra of our qsos show evidence for strong ionized winds which produce the x - ray obscuration @xcite .",
    "piecing all these clues together , we inferred that the host galaxies of these qsos are undergoing strong sf , while the central smbh are also growing through accretion . in principle",
    "the ionized winds are strong enough to quench the sf @xcite so , given that the qsos have powerful submm emission , these objects are then caught at a special time , perhaps emerging from a strongly obscured accretion state in an evolutionary stage which might last about 10 - 15 per cent of the qso lifetime @xcite , which tallies nicely with x - ray absorbed broad line agn being about 15 per cent of the x - ray broad line population ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the ionized winds are de - coupled from the sf , but then why only x - ray - absorbed agn are submm - luminous remains to be explained .",
    "some geometrical effect might be invoked , but it is difficult to see how to reconcile the dramatically different scales at which both processes are expected to happen .    here , we endeavour to get the physical properties of the central qsos ( luminosities , bh masses , eddington ratios , etc . ) and their host galaxies ( sfr , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc . ) and their mutual relationships ( or lack thereof ) .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present our sample and summarize the data used . in section 3 , we present the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of all our objects , explain how we have made fits to several representative templates and obtained results from them .",
    "moreover , we calculate the black hole properties from uv - optical spectra and we study the time scales of the evolution of the agn and the host galaxy . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss all results and compare them with those found in other samples .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section 5 .    we have assumed throughout this paper a hubble constant @xmath18  km / s / mpc , and density parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "these data include two photometric bands ( 100@xmath15 m and 160@xmath15 m ) from the pacs instrument @xcite and three photometric spire bands ( 250@xmath15 m , 350@xmath15 m and 500@xmath15 m ) ; @xcite , see table [ othersdata ] .",
    "the pacs observations were performed in two scan orientations ( 70and 110 ) for each band and field .",
    "these images were combined using the standard pipeline of herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe v8 and v10 ) .",

    "in this section we will piece together the clues obtained above about the nature of our objects",
    ".    from the sed shapes and template fits , we see some differences in the properties of the objects in our sample : rx  j0057 and rx  j1249 have similar redshifts @xmath28 , small optical obscurations , the highest bolometric agn luminosities and a preference for the first torus model in @xcite .",
    "rx  j0941 and rx  j1218 have again similar redshifts @xmath29 , higher optical obscurations , the lowest bolometric agn luminosities and also allow for the empirical @xcite and the second @xcite torus models . finally , rx  j1633 has the highest redshift @xmath30 , small optical obscuration , intermediate bolometric agn luminosity and a strong preference for the third torus model in @xcite .",
    "this results in a higher torus contribution at longer wavelengths , intuitively corresponding to a higher probability of further reprocessing of the direct emission at larger distances and lower temperatures .",
    "additional evidence for a ( relative ) higher inclination of rx  j1633 comes from its radio morphology in first images , which shows two diffuse blobs roughly symmetrical with respect to the optical position of the qso , in contrast with the rest of our objects , which are either not detected ( rx  j0057 and rx  j1218 ) or pointlike ( rx  j0941 and rx  j1249 ) .",
    "the host galaxies of rx  j0941 and rx  j1218 seem to be growing much faster than their black holes , both in absolute terms and compared to the other objects .",
    "this is because their agn are less luminous but have similar @xmath11 to the rest .",
    "the difference in agn luminosities between the objects could be ascribed to the redshift , since those further away are also more luminous , as expected in a flux - limited sample , but this is belied by the intermediate luminosity of the highest redshift object rx  j1633 , which is also the one with the most discordant torus properties . in any case , with such a small sample it is impossible to assess the significance and implications of the differences observed .      in this section",
    "we want to study the main properties of the agn . taking the sample as a whole",
    ", we can compare their overall properties to those of type 1 qso from the sdss dr7 @xcite : bolometric luminosities @xcite , eddington luminosities and ratios @xcite and covering factors @xcite .",
    "as expected from the design of the sample ( @xcite ) , their x - ray and bolometric luminosities are similar to those of qsos in their redshift ranges ( using a range @xmath31 ) , except for rx  j1249 , which is truly exceptional : there are only 50 objects brighter than rx  j1249 ( @xmath320.05% ) in the whole sample of @xcite , and it is one of the most luminous object even comparing with the high - bolometric - luminosity - selected sample of @xcite .",
    "also , as discussed above , the shape of their seds in the optical - mir region is unexceptional .    from table",
    "[ discu ] , three of our qsos have eddington ratios around 0.1 ( rx  j0057 , rx  j0941 and rx  j1218 ) , one has a value around 0.6 ( rx  j1249 ) and the last one is closer to unity ( rx  j1633 ) , although with large error bars , specially in the last two .",
    "this range of values is compatible with that found by @xcite , who have studied a sample of @xmath13 58000 type 1 qso , also finding that @xmath33 are significantly rarer at @xmath34 compared to @xmath35 , while objects with @xmath36 are found similarly in both redshift ranges .",
    "this is also similar to what we see in our sample , where the four objects with @xmath37 are compatible with @xmath38 ,",
    "while rx  j1633 at @xmath30 shows some preference for higher values of @xmath39 .",
    "they conclude that type 1 quasars radiating near the eddington limited are extremely rare , suggesting that type 1 quasars violating the eddington limit do so only for a very brief period of time .",
    "rx  j1633 could be in this situation .",
    "@xcite have estimated the covering factors @xmath40 of their wise - ukidss - sdss ( wus ) quasar sample ( 5281 quasars ) with @xmath41 .",
    "they have found an average value of @xmath42 , but in addition they also get that two - thirds of type 1 quasars have @xmath40 in the range 0.25 to 0.61 , roughly as in our sample . segregating the sources according to their bolometric luminosities , our four lower luminosity objects are in their @xmath43 bin . a quick montecarlo sampling of the log - normal fit to their @xmath40 distribution ( calculating values from our sample with respect to the mean values of the distribution and five random distribution values with respect to the mean values too ) shows than an unremarkable 40  per cent of the simulated samples have a similar distribution as our objects in this bin . in contrast , rx  j1249 is in their highest luminosity bin ( @xmath44 ) , where only three percent of the objects have a higher @xmath40 than this source : rx  j1249 is not only one of the most luminous objects known",
    ", it also has an exceptionally high reprocessed - to - bolometric agn luminosity ratio for its luminosity .",
    "we have calculated the bolometric corrections to the x - ray luminosities for our sample defined as : @xmath45 finding values @xmath46 ( see table  [ discu ] ) for @xmath47 .",
    "although at face value this looks very different from the results of @xcite , our three objects with @xmath48 ( rx  j0057 , rx  j0941 and rx  j1218 ) are well within the values spanned by the objects in their sample at similar eddington ratios @xmath49 ( see their fig .",
    "the most discrepant objects are rx  j1249 and rx  j1633 .",
    "the former presents an extremely high bolometric correction around 500 , more in line with its bal nature @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "rx  j1633 , our highest redshift object , presents a bolometric correction of about 30 for an eddington ratio of about 1 .",
    "only one object from @xcite has a smaller correction for that ratio , although there are a few more with @xmath50 and @xmath51 in their sample , so it is not exceptional .",
    "we have also compared our bolometric corrections with those of @xcite .",
    "only rx  j0057 is close to their relation and inside the dispersion region , rx  j1249 and rx  j0941 are above the relation and rx  j1218 and rx  j1633 are below the curve . again",
    "the most discrepant sources are rx  j1249 and rx  j1633 .",
    "regarding now the star formation properties of our sample , we have obtained very high sfrs@xmath52/y : these objects are forming stars copiously and they are at the ulirg / hlirg level with strong fir emission .",
    "the distribution of greybody temperatures ( @xmath53  k ) of the sf templates of our sources seems to be closer to those of smgs ( @xmath54  k , @xcite ) , than to those of other high redshift qsos ( @xmath55  k , @xcite ) : the range of temperatures in the latter work is @xmath56  k while only two of our sources have temperatures compatible with the lower bound of the interval ( rx  j0057 and rx  j1249 , the first subset discussed at the beginning of this section ) .",
    "on the other hand , we obtain greybody slopes ( @xmath57 ) below those of typical smg ( @xmath58 @xcite ) and high redshift qsos ( @xmath59 @xcite ) , even taking into account the substantial error bars .",
    "however , our temperatures and slopes could be affected by the limited wavelength range of the greybody fits to the sf templates , since the sf thermal bump in our sources is generally broader than in simple greybody models , and hence the fit tends towards low values of @xmath60 ( to match the steep decline at the longest wavelengths ) and low values of @xmath61 , to accommodate the extra width at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "if we just use a simple greybody model to parametrize the sf , instead of the more elaborate templates of @xcite , we confirm the above tendency : both rx  j0057 and rx  j1249 prefer higher temperatures than in the limited - range - fit to the best - fit sf template , while the rest show similar or slightly lower temperatures .",
    "this would go in line with the fact that in the former two objects the maximum of the sf emission is lower than that of the torus emission , while in rx  j0941 and rx  j1218 the opposite happens .",
    "finally , it might well happen that a single temperature fit without some modification at the high frequency end is not sufficiently accurate to allow a precise determination of @xmath61-t values . in any case",
    ", the exact values of those parameters in particular fits have a very limited impact in our inferred luminosities , since we derive quantities from averages and dispersions over the best group of fits .      in the context of possible evidence for an influence of the central agn on the evolution of its host galaxy , it is interesting to compare the rate of black hole growth ( as gauged from e.g. the x - ray luminosity @xmath62 , the intrinsic bolometric luminosity from agn @xmath63 , or the accretion rate @xmath64 ) to the rate of galaxy growth ( from the sfr , the lir or the monochromatic 60@xmath15 m luminosity ) .",
    "@xcite studied the correlation between @xmath65 ) at 60@xmath15 m and pah emission ( as proxies of the sf luminosity ) and @xmath66 ) at 5100(as a proxy for the agn luminosity ) for a sample of qsos at similar @xmath24 to ours with spitzer spectroscopic data in the rest - frame mid - infrared .",
    "they have found that , at high luminosities and @xmath24 , there was a flattening of the relation between sf and agn luminosity that is observed for lower redshift qsos .",
    "@xcite used 100 and 160 @xmath15 m fluxes from goods - herschel finding no evidence of any correlation between the x - ray and infrared luminosities of moderate luminosity agns at any redshift .",
    "@xcite found a significant ( @xmath6799% ) correlation between @xmath62 and sfr ( see figure  [ fig_rovilos ] ) in a deep goods - xmm - newton - herschel sample , taking into account the upper limits on the latter using the asurv package ( @xcite ) .",
    "they also found a significant correlation between the specific sfr ( ssfr ) and x - ray luminosity , taking into account both upper limits and a possible partial correlation with the redshift .",
    "@xcite used the cosmos - goods- north and south x - ray selected sample .",
    "they study @xmath66 ) at 60@xmath15 m vs. @xmath63 finding a significant correlation between @xmath68 at 60@xmath15 m and @xmath63 for moderate redshifts ( @xmath69 ) and high luminosities .",
    "interestingly , all our objects are in the redshift range ( @xmath70 ) studied by @xcite .",
    "they studied herschel spire observations of the cdf - n field ( within the hermes project ) and found evidence for star formation ( from 250  @xmath15 m detections ) in some x - ray detected agn with @xmath71  erg / s , but lower star formation in the @xmath72  erg / s luminosity bin .",
    "they took this as evidence for suppression of sfr in the most luminous agn at that epoch in the universe .",
    "since all our objects are very significantly detected in 250  @xmath15 m and have @xmath73  erg / s ( see fig . [ fig_rovilos ] ) , in this scenario these highly luminous qsos would not yet have managed to switch off sf .    in this controversial context , we have revisited the @xmath74 vs. @xmath75 correlation using both their sample and a joint sample with our sources ( including data from @xcite ) .",
    "we have tested for a `` hidden '' correlation with redshift ( specifically with the luminosity distance @xmath76 ) using the method in @xcite , who give their significance in terms of a ratio between the generalized kendall s @xmath77 and its dispersion @xmath78 .",
    "we first started with just their sample , finding @xmath79 .",
    "we tested this significance against simulated samples of sources with mutually uncorrelated sfr and x - ray luminosity values , but both correlated with redshift .",
    "briefly , we found the constants @xmath80 that best reproduced the @xmath81 relations , with @xmath82 ( using only detections ) and @xmath83 , estimated the rms around these relations for several ranges of redshift , and then created 10000 samples of sources keeping the redshifts of the observed sources and simulating the x - ray luminosities and the sfr with the above `` calibrations '' . for upper limits in sfr",
    "we kept the observed upper limit but randomized the x - ray luminosity as above .",
    "these simulated samples keep the statistics of the @xcite sample but do not have any real correlation between sfr and x - ray luminosity .",
    "we found that 653 of those had @xmath84 , so we conclude that the real significance of the correlation in their sample is about @xmath85%@xmath86 .",
    "we now wish to add our sample to this relation to check its influence .",
    "we need to use our full parent sample in @xcite , including the non - detections at 850  @xmath15 m .",
    "note that there are three more `` detections '' in that paper compared to this paper : rx  j1107 + 72 ( because it is radio - loud and hence its fir emission originates in the agn ) , rx  j0943 + 16 and rx  j1104 + 35 ( these two are @xmath87 significant ) .",
    "the 0.5 - 2  kev luminosities in that paper @xcite have been converted to 2 - 10  kev luminosities assuming @xmath88 ( we have checked that this method agreed well with the 2 - 10  kev luminosities from @xcite used elsewhere in this work ) . for the five common sources , we have fitted the best multiplicative constant between the 850  @xmath15m - derived fir luminosities in @xcite and our sed - derived fir luminosities , taking into account the uncertainties in both quantities . using this",
    "multiplicative constant we have then derived `` corrected '' fir luminosities and sfr ( eq .  [ sfr_eq ] ) for all sources in @xcite sample ( green points in fig.[fig_rovilos ] ) .",
    "the linked points show the magnitude of the re - scaling for the five common sources ( red -this paper- , green -rescaled- ) .",
    "the rescaled full parent sample has been joined to the @xcite sample to study the x - ray luminosity - sfr correlation .",
    "again , we have created 10000 random samples as explained above ( re - calibrating the sfr and x - ray luminosity correlations with redshift and their rms ) .",
    "the joint sample gave @xmath89 .",
    "only 23 out of 10000 random simulations showed higher values , so the significance is @xmath1399.8%@xmath90 .",
    "this joint correlation is more significant probably because our five detected sources extend the x - ray luminosity range by almost an order of magnitude .    at face value",
    ", it appears that there is a significant correlation between the growth of galaxies via star formation and the growth of their central smbh via accretion in the joint sample .",
    "however , a number of caveats are in order to interpret the observed correlation .",
    "first , given the very different selection functions of the samples involved ( between them and among their constituent surveys at different wavelengths ) and the small numbers of sources involved , it is very difficult to assess the significance of the different results in terms of the full population of black - hole - growing and/or star - forming galaxies at that epoch in the universe .",
    "large samples of objects at the relevant redshifts with well - controlled selection functions are needed to appraise this crucial issue .",
    "furthermore , our sed - derived sfr cover very well the fir rest - frame range even at our highest redshift ( as they include observed frame points between 100 and 850  @xmath15 m ) and the `` corrected '' ones used for the correlation come originally from observed - frame 850  @xmath15 m observations ( similar to @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "the highest observed wavelength in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite is 160  @xmath15 m , which only covers the short - wavelength side of the fir bump at redshifts above 1 , with the ensuing uncertainty in the fir luminosities , despite the careful sed fit .         for our sample .",
    "( from @xcite).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    previous works have found some evidence of a correlation between the sf of the host and the agn obscuration by neutral gas in the x - rays ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "later studies with deeper surveys both in the x - ray and infrared ranges have failed to reproduce these results ( e.g @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we have therefore looked instead for a correlation between the ionised column density n@xmath10 ( from @xcite ) and sfr in our sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig_nh_sfr ] ) , finding a tentative positive correlation between these parameters .",
    "this is interesting , since it would imply a coupling of the ionized gas absorbing the x - rays at the scale of the accretion disk or the blr with the gas forming stars in the host galaxy bulge , about three orders of magnitude farther away . at face value , this would be compatible with a positive feedback scenario , @xcite in which the ionized outflowing gas would trigger star formation in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy , with the highest column density gas corresponding to stronger feedback .    alternatively , the agn may also be ionising gas at kpc scales , co - located with the sf gas , so the above correlation would just be a consequence of the gas of higher density forming stars more intensely . testing this intriguing possibility ( with implications on positive and negative feedback ) would need larger samples with a better determination of the location of the ionised gas .",
    "we now turn to the fate of the objects in our sample . assuming constant accretion rates , we have estimated in section  [ timescales ] their bh mass - doubling times @xmath77 and the time they would take to reach the maximum bh mass observed locally @xmath91 .",
    "we note that rx  j0057 , rx  j0941 and rx  j1249 are already within a factor of 2 - 3 of this maximum local bh mass ( @xmath92 ) , so their bh growth phase is expected to finish within one to three mass - doubling times at most , i.e. 700 , 1200 and 80 million years respectively . given the expected lifetime of an active qso phase of about 200 million years @xcite , rx  j1249 would have time to reach that maximum mass , while the other two objects would stop at a lower , but not much lower , mass .",
    "the bh in the centre of rx  j1633 , the least massive in our sample ( but already with a considerable mass of about @xmath93 , larger than about 60% of the objects in @xcite ) , is growing quite fast , doubling its mass in 40  million years , so it could increase its mass by a factor of a few within the fiducial qso lifetime above .",
    "rx  j1218 has a intermediate bh mass in our sample ( about 10 times lower than the local maximum ) , but its accretion rate is the lowest in the sample , so its mass - doubling time is 3  gy . therefore ,",
    "unless something happens to re - kindle the agn at a later time , it is unlikely to grow much more .    without a determination of the masses of the host galaxies of our objects we can not perform a similar exercise for the expected lifetime of the starburst phase .",
    "unfortunately , the uv - to - mir range is completely dominated by the agn light .",
    "we are trying to secure mm observations to estimate the host galaxy masses directly .",
    "nevertheless , we can argue that the sfrs observed are very high ( albeit with considerable uncertainties ) , among the highest observed at the relevant redshifts , so they are unlikely to be maintained for a long time .",
    "considering further episodes of strong galaxy growth with little agn growth does not help to escape that the galaxies should be already formed , since either the host galaxy has to swallow whole fully - formed large - mass galaxies without forming stars ( and with insignificant bh masses ) , or the ensuing sfr would have to be several times larger than the already extraordinary ones found in our objects ( while at the same time avoiding a significant infall of gas to the galaxy nucleus to make sure to starve the massive bh already in place ) .    in an independent line of argument , in the event that there is a positive feedback at work , as discussed in section [ agn - sf ] , then the bulk of the gas mass in the host galaxies could be about to form stars pressured by the now maximal agn , and so perhaps that could allow the bh - bulge relation to be reached quickly . however , this would be surprising , because the @xmath94 of stars in an elliptical today typically seem to have formed at higher redshifts @xcite .    in the context of co - evolution of agn and their host galaxies ,",
    "e.g. the recent recently proposed by @xcite , our objects , with @xmath95 would be in a stage when the fir - luminous phase is close to end ( figure 15 in @xcite ) , in qualitative agreement with our conclusion that their host galaxies are already mostly formed .",
    "we have studied a sample of x - ray - obscured qsos at @xmath37 with strong submm emission @xcite , much higher than most x - ray - unobscured qsos at similar redshifts and luminosities , which , however , represent 85 - 90 per cent of the x - ray qsos at the epoch .",
    "we have built x - ray - to - fir seds for each object and we have fitted them using different models ( a direct agn accretion disk , a torus - reprocessed component and a star formation component ) .",
    "we confirm that direct agn , reprocessed agn and sf components are needed to correctly characterize the seds of our objects .",
    "we have used these fits , together with our previous determinations of their x - ray luminosities , to estimate the total direct and reprocessed agn luminosities and the luminosity associated to the star formation , as well as other derived physical quantities .",
    "we confirm the presence of strong fir emission in these objects ( well above that expected from plausible agn emission models ) which we attribute to sf at the ulirg / hlirg level with sfr@xmath131000 @xmath96y .",
    "their associated greybody temperature values are close to those of submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "they have dust masses around @xmath97  m@xmath98 .",
    "we have found a just over 3-@xmath78 significant correlation between the sfr and the x - ray luminosity when joining our sample with that from @xcite .",
    "this is usually taken as evidence for joint agn and galaxy growth , but the differences between the techniques used to detect and characterize sf in those two samples detract from this otherwise exciting , interpretation .",
    "our objects fall in the high luminosity end of large samples from deep surveys @xcite , but have similar properties to other samples of high @xmath24 , high fir luminosity objects @xcite .",
    "however , rxj1249 stands out in all cases : it is one of the most luminous objects known ( bolometric luminosity @xmath99 ) and it has an exceptionally high torus - to - bolometric luminosity ratio for its luminosity .    comparing their agn reprocessed and direct emission , we have obtained the ratios between the reprocessed emission from the torus and the total agn bolometric luminosity @xmath100 , higher than qsos of similar luminosities at @xmath41 .",
    "the eddington ratios of our objects ( 0.1 - 0.6 ) are common for their redshift range , except for rx  j1633 ( our highest redshift object ) which has a value of that ratio close to unity .",
    "overall , the bolometric corrections of our objects do not fit well with those of other studies @xcite , showing higher bolometric luminosities compared to their x - ray luminosities .",
    "we have found a tentative positive correlation between nh@xmath101 and sfr , perhaps indicative of positive feedback between the x - ray and uv - detected ionized outflowing gas and the interstellar medium of their host galaxies .",
    "the black holes powering our qsos are very massive at their epoch , @xmath102 ( measured from broad emission lines in their optical - uv spectra ) .",
    "we have calculated their mass - doubling timescale @xmath77 and the time to reach the maximum bh mass observed locally , concluding that they can not grow much more .",
    "a further hint in this direction comes from the high eddington ratio of rx  j1633 which , according to @xcite should persist only for a very brief period of time .",
    "rx  j1249 could become one of the most massive objects known .",
    "we do not know the masses of their host galaxies , but their black hole masses and their high sfr lead us to conclude that they are already very massive or they would not have enough time to reach the local bulge - to - black - hole - mass ratio .",
    "this is also in agreement with recent models of agn - host galaxy co - evolution .",
    "direct determinations of the gas mass and of the mass of the host galaxies our qsos are needed to have a better grasp of the nature and evolutionary status of these exceptional objects , and hence to understand their role in the disputed landscape of co - evolution of galaxies and agn .",
