    "complex network tools have been used in different fields from social , technological and biological networks  @xcite , to analyze the structure and dynamics of the network .",
    "different centrality measures have been used to find the important vertices in a network e.g. , degree centrality , eigenvector centrality , katz centrality , vertex betweenness centrality , edge betweenness centrality , closeness centrality@xcite , etc . among them ,",
    "the simplest measure is the degree centrality .",
    "degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it .",
    "pagerank is another important measure and is used in network tasks like , information retrieval , link prediction and community detection@xcite . in 1998 , brin and page  @xcite developed the pagerank algorithm to rank websites in their search engine .",
    "pagerank score , @xmath0 , of a vertex @xmath1 in an undirected and unweighted network , is defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the damping factor , also known as teleportation factor , @xmath4 is the adjacency matrix corresponding to the network , @xmath5 is the degree of the vertex @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the intrinsic , non - network contribution .",
    "many researchers have studied the significance of @xmath8 in pagerank @xcite . however , till now , no study has been taken place for the same for @xmath7 . in many cases",
    "the value of @xmath7 has been taken as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "localization of eigenvector is a common phenomenon in most of the networks and it is frequently suggested that the main cause of localization is due to the presence of high degree vertices @xcite .",
    "localization means that most of the weight of the centrality accumulates in a few number of vertices .",
    "recently , empirical studies in pagerank suggest that pagerank does not show localization @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we show that depending upon intrinsic and non - network contribution , pagerank value changes . this article has been organized in the following way : in chapter [ aproof ]",
    ", we show that if the intrinsic and non - network contribution of the vertices are the same or proportional to their degrees , then the pageranks remain same or proportional to the degree of the vertices .",
    "we also show that if the intrinsic and non - network contribution of the vertices is zero then pagerank values become proportional to the degrees . in chapter",
    "[ numerical ] , our study on simulated and empirical networks support our findings . on the contrary to the common belief",
    "we show that , for some networks , pagerank centrality can be localized and the value of @xmath7 can effect in the localization of the pagerank centrality . chapter [ conclusion ] concludes with some discussion .",
    "consider a simple undirected connected network @xmath10 of size @xmath11 , with adjacency matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the pagerank centrality @xmath0 of a vertex @xmath1 in the network @xmath10 is defined as :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the damping factor ( google search engine uses @xmath14  @xcite ) , @xmath5 denotes the degree of vertex @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the intrinsic and non - network contribution to the vertex @xmath1 .    in matrix form ,",
    "the equation ( [ equ1 ] ) can be written as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the diagonal matrix with elements @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "equation ( [ equ2 ] ) can be written as : @xmath19 since @xmath20 equation ( [ equ3 ] ) can be written as the sum of an infinite series :    @xmath21    now @xmath22 , is a column stochastic matrix . since @xmath10 is undirected and connected @xmath23 is diagonalizable .",
    "one can write @xmath24 as a linear combination of the eigenvectors @xmath25 of @xmath23 , as    @xmath26    then the equation ( [ equ5 ] ) becomes    @xmath27    let @xmath28 be the eigenvalues of @xmath23 corresponding to the eigenvectors @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "then    @xmath30    after some simple calculation , we get    @xmath31    since , @xmath32 , we get    @xmath33    therefore , the pagerank vector @xmath34 of a network is the linear sum of eigenvectors of @xmath23",
    ".    if the value of @xmath24 is proportional to degrees , then equation ( [ equ6 ] ) becomes : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the leading eigenvector of @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath36 is proportional to the degree of the network .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ equ10 ] ) reduces to @xmath37 hence , pagerank centrality is proportional to the degree of the network .",
    "pagerank can also be quantified successively with an initial estimation of @xmath34 from equation ( [ equ1 ] ) or ( equivalently equation ( [ equ2 ] ) ) .",
    "equation ( [ equ2 ] ) will be , @xmath38    where @xmath39 is any initial value of @xmath34 usually taken @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "if the intrinsic and non - network contribution is zero , then from equation ( [ remark2 ] ) , we get @xmath41 in this case , we take @xmath39 any non - zero vector as @xmath40 will not contribute anything .",
    "after @xmath42 iterative steps we have @xmath43 now , writing @xmath39 as a linear combination of the eigenvectors @xmath44 of @xmath23 , we get @xmath45 for some appropriate choice of @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath47 since @xmath48 for all @xmath49 , we get @xmath50 in the limit @xmath51 . as @xmath52 and @xmath8 are constants and @xmath36 is proportional to degree , it follows that pagerank centrality is proportional to the degree centrality .",
