    "@xmath8li is a very fragile isotope that is destroyed at temperatures above @xmath10 k. in stars that are too hot , convection within the star occurs close to the surface and leads to a mixing of the atmosphere and the hotter , deeper layers of the star , and destruction of @xmath9 , hence very hot stars are also not sampled .",

    "we are mostly concerned with the 66 ( of 77 ) measurements that have error estimates .",
    "section [ analysis ] describes our statistical analyses of the abundance data including finding central estimates using weighted mean and median statistics , analyzing the distribution of errors around the central estimates , and fitting several popular probability distribution functions to the observed error distribution .",

    "this shallow convection is seen in warm metal - poor stars with an effective temperature @xmath24 k. these constraints result in a sample of 77 measurements .",
    "we do not consider two of the 77 measurements because they are upper bounds .",
    "in most of our statistical analyses we consider only 66 values of the remaining 75 ( with an @xmath25 ( mean and 1@xmath2 error ) ) measurements that have error bars . , but this accounts only for that from the signal to noise ratio , and is not the full error , so we do not include these in our analyses here . ]",

    "a large @xmath16 can be caused by correlations between measurements , systematic error , or invalidity of the gaussian assumption .",
    "the second statistical tool we use in analyzing the @xmath9 measurements is median statistics . for a detailed description of median statistics",

    "we assume that the measurements are statistically independent , and have no systematic error as a whole . as the number of measurements increase to infinity",
    ", the median will become a true value .",
    "this method has the advantage that it does not make use of the quoted errors .",
    "consequentially this will result in a larger uncertainty than that of the weighted mean method .",
    "if the measurements are statistically independent then there is a 50% chance of finding any value above or below the median . as described in @xcite , the probability of the @xmath35 measurement being higher or lower than the true median is @xmath36    with the use of weighted mean statistics we find a central estimate of @xmath37 with a weighted error of @xmath38 .",
    "we also find @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; such a large value is cause for concern . using median statistics",
    "we find a lithium abundance central estimate of @xmath41 with a 1@xmath2 range of @xmath42 , and a 2@xmath2 range of @xmath43 . with a 1@xmath2 range of @xmath42 , and a 2@xmath2 range of @xmath44 , reassuringly consistent with the values determined above .",

    "as noted above , this perhaps tells us something about the observers ability to estimate systematic and statistical uncertainties .",
    "this could also be an indication that a definite resolution might need to wait for more and higher - quality data .",
    "however , here we speculate a bit about the statistical significance of the li problem .    to determine the statistical significance of the discrepancy , we first assume gaussianity and find the difference between the mean of the @xmath5 data predicted value @xmath134 @xcite and our median value @xmath135 .",
    "we divide this difference by the quadrature sum of our error ( @xmath136 ) and that from @xcite ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this results in a @xmath138 discrepancy . to account for the non - gaussianity",
    ", we simply multiply our @xmath136 error by 1.4 ( table [ table : nsigma limits ] , second to last line ) in the quadrature sum , resulting in a @xmath139 discrepancy .    to attempt to characterize the a(li ) error distribution",
    ", we fit various popular probability distribution functions to it .",
    "we find that the observed error distribution has larger probability in the tails than a gaussian distribution , but less than a cauchy distribution . while allowing the scale factor to vary over the range @xmath140 , the error distribution is best fit by an @xmath3 student s @xmath4 distribution , although better fits can be found for larger @xmath101 and @xmath81 .",
    "we have not followed up on this in detail since this is unlikely to be of much physical significance .    in conclusion , while it would be good to have more and higher - quality a(li ) data that results in a gaussian error distribution so as to be able to draw a definite conclusion , it seems fair to conclude that the non - gaussianity of the current data can not fully resolve the li problem .",

    "@xcite have argued that the effective temperature error is larger than previously thought .",
    "if this is so then it could dominate the error , resulting in the same error for each a(li ) measurement . to illustrate the effect of such a potential error , we repeat our analysis with a constant , optimistic , @xmath141 . of @xcite and reached similar conclusions . ] for the weighted mean case 68.3% of the signed error distribution falls within @xmath142 while 95.4% lies in the range of @xmath143 and the absolute magnitude of the error distribution have corresponding limits of @xmath144 and @xmath145 respectively . for the median statistics",
