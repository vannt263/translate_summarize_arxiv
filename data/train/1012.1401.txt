    "entanglement , arguably , one of the most important ingredients in quantum information , has been extensively explored and investigated in recent years  @xcite . it can exist in the form of pure entangled states such as bell states , which enable many quantum information processing protocols  @xcite . in the regime of mixed states , entanglement can exhibit more features  @xcite . of these ,",
    "the bound entangled states  @xcite have very fragile entanglement properties ; they require entanglement to create them , but once they are formed , there is no way of locally distilling any useful free entanglement from them . bound entangled states lie on the border of entangled states with un - entangled states . while the characteristics of bound entanglement are interesting theoretically in their own right , they are usually considered to be of little practical use , analogous to heat in thermodynamics",
    "nevertheless , some bound entangled states have found application in information concentration  @xcite , bi - partite activation  @xcite , multi - partite superactiviation  @xcite and secure key distillation  @xcite , as well as providing a resource for certain zero - capacity quantum channels  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that more applications with bound entanglement will be found .",
    "nevertheless , it was not until very recently that the synthesis of certain bound entangled states was attempted in the laboratory , including multi - qubit states  @xcite and continuous - variable states  @xcite .",
    "this paper considers a collection of multi - qubit bound entangled states of various types , including acn - bru - lewenstein - sanpara three - qubit states  @xcite , smolin s four - qubit state  @xcite , dr s @xmath0-qubit states  @xcite , lee - lee - kim @xmath0-qubit bound entangled states  @xcite and an unextendible - product - basis ( upb ) bound entangled state  @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent experiments on creating bound entangled states  @xcite , we propose schemes for creating these states using photon polarization .",
    "this section gives a brief review of the ideas in refs .",
    "@xcite ; see also ref .  @xcite .",
    "the key point is that mixed states are created by a statistical mixture of pure states .",
    "the smolin state  @xcite is a four - qubit mixed state @xmath1 where the @xmath2 s are the four bell states @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the form  ( [ eqn : rhoabcd ] ) suggests that the smolin state can be generated by mixing the four terms of the four - particle states , each being a product of two bell pairs .",
    "note that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 s stand for the identity and the three pauli operators , respectively ) ; namely , the four bell states can be locally converted into one another .",
    "once two pairs of @xmath10 states have been produced using , e.g. , downconversion  @xcite , one only needs to randomly and simultaneously apply either one of @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 with equal probability to one photon of each entangled pair",
    ". the resultant statistical mixture will be the smolin state , as was done in refs .",
    "@xcite    we remark that the entanglement in the smolin state can be unlocked if two of the parties can perform a joint bell - state analysis  @xcite .",
    "this state can be used , e.g. , in information concentration  @xcite and multipartite superactiviation  @xcite . as far as the amount of entanglement",
    "is concerned , for the smolin state the negativity @xmath14  @xcite is zero for any 2:2 partitioning , e.g. , \\{ab : cd } , but nonzero for 1:3 partitioning , e.g.,\\{a : bcd}. specifically , @xmath15 but @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the smolin state has the same amount of entanglement as the greenberger - horne - zeilinger-(ghz ) state , as quantified by the geometric measure of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "note that the state @xmath17 can also be written as @xmath18 where the @xmath19 s are the four orthogonal ghz states : @xmath20 this also provides an alternative way of creating the smolin state using a four - photon ghz state as a resource . in practice ,",
    "the four - photon ghz state is also created from two pairs of bell states  @xcite . for many other states below it",
    "is essential to use a ghz state as a resource state .",
    "we remark that barreiro et al .",
    "synthesized this bound entangled state with trapped ions , first by creating an appropriate diagonal state , followed by a four - qubit unitary entangling gate  @xcite .",
    "acn , bru , lewenstein and sanpera ( abls ) have proposed a class of three - qubit bound entangled states  @xcite , described by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the three - qubit ghz state @xmath23 and the parameter @xmath24 is a normalization factor @xmath25 , and parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 satisfy @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the last condition , derived using the so - called range criterion  @xcite , ensures that the abls state is entangled  @xcite .",
    "this family of states can be rewritten as    @xmath31    where the un - normalized states @xmath32 s are defined via the following un - normalized states , @xmath33    in addition to using the range criteria  @xcite , the existence of entanglement in this family of states can also be detected by entanglement witnesses  @xcite . that the states are positive under partial transpose ( ppt ) ascertains that they are undistillable with respect to any bipartition  @xcite .",
    "being both entangled and undistillable , the above family of states are therefore bound entangled .",
    "kampermann et al .",
    "used a liquid - nmr system to implement these states , and they referred to the resultant states as pseudo bound - entangled states as the true states created are mixture of a small relative amount of these bound entangled states with a large amount of the completely mixed state .",
    "strictly speaking , no true entanglement is present in such a system , unless the temperature is very low .",
    "it is thus interesting to see whether these bound entangled states can be created in other systems , where genuine entanglement can be easily achieved .",
    "although abls states were only implemented in liquid nmr , other states , such as the smolin s state  @xcite , have been created in other systems , such as photons  @xcite and trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this section is to provide a scheme for creating abls bound entangled states with photon polarization .",
    "s indicate collectively either ( 1 ) identity or ( 2 ) unitary gates ( @xmath12 or @xmath34 ) implemented by waveplates , followed by switchable partial polarizers .",
    "the indicated loss is due to partial polarizers .",
    "hwp stands for the half - wave plate and ps stands for the phase shifter that turns @xmath35 ; both elements can be switched on and off .",
    "bd stands for the beam - displacer ( see , e.g. , refs  @xcite ) , which separates , say , @xmath36 and @xmath37 polarizations , and lc stands for the liquid crystal , which acts as a waveplate . the second bd is placed upside down so as to combine the displaced beams . the lcs control",
    "the degree of partial polarization , and their action can be switched on and off.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    kamperman et al . synthesized their bound entangled state by first creating an appropriate diagonal state , followed by a three - qubit unitary gate  @xcite .",
    "this approach is very difficult with photons , as entangling gates are hard to come by .",
    "so how can one create abls bound entangled states using photon polarization states ?",
    "suppose we have a ghz state @xmath38 ( where h stands for a horizontally polarized photon , and v is a vertically polarized photon ) , and , for example , we have a switchable unitary gate ( implementable by pockels cell  @xcite or liquid crystals  @xcite ) at the path of photon 3 to control the possible actions : ( i ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; ( ii ) @xmath39 and @xmath41 ; ( iii ) do nothing , then the resultant state is ( i ) @xmath42 ; ( ii ) @xmath43 ; or ( iii ) @xmath38 , respectively . furthermore ,",
    "if we have a switchable partial polarizer  @xcite ( which is switched on only in the former two cases ) acting on photon 3 , with polarization - dependent transmissions being @xmath44 , then the state @xmath45 is transformed ( probabilistically ) to @xmath46 ( un - normalized ) .",
    "this is the key step to create the @xmath47 state .",
    "note that @xmath48 and @xmath49 will be created with equal probability and that one should choose @xmath50 .",
    "such partial polarizers are an important ingredient in implementing general local filtering operations  @xcite , as was used in various places , such as the procrustean method for entanglement distillation  @xcite and the construction of optimal witnesses  @xcite . similarly",
    ", we can have such sets of devices ( i.e. , switchable waveplates and partial polarizers ) placed in the path of the other two photons with transmission coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( which satisfy @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , respectively , to create @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "by appropriately mixing these states together with the ghz state , i.e. , firing the three pockels cells probabilistically to match the relative weight in the state @xmath57 , we will create the state at the collection output ports , conditioned on the occurrence of a three - fold coincidence .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : abls ] for the schematic setup .",
    "in particular , the probabilities that no pockels cell fires and that either @xmath26- , @xmath27- , or @xmath28-th pockels cell fires are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , or @xmath61 , respectively , and they should satisfy @xmath62",
    "it was shown by dr and cirac  @xcite that an arbitrary @xmath0-qubit state @xmath63 can be locally depolarized into the form @xmath64 while preserving @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , and the @xmath68 s are ghz - like states @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the binary representation of @xmath72 with @xmath73 or @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "normalization gives the condition @xmath76    now define @xmath77 , which we assume to be non - negative without loss of generality .",
    "consider a bipartite partitioning @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) which divides @xmath80 into two groups , with one of them containing indices @xmath81 such that @xmath82 in the binary representation of @xmath83 .",
    "the rest of the indices @xmath84 ( with @xmath85 ) , in addition to @xmath0 , are contained in the other group .",
    "one can compute the negativity with respect to the partitioning @xmath78 , and obtains  @xcite @xmath86 a sufficient condition to infer that the state is entangled is @xmath87 for certain @xmath72 , and this means that @xmath88 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath89 , i.e.,@xmath90 this condition implies that there can not exist distillable entanglement across the bipartition @xmath78  @xcite .    from the form of the states  ( [ eqn : dc ] ) , it is easy to see that all the above dr - cirac states can be created by the method of mixing , once an @xmath0-partite ghz state can be generated . in the following",
    "we shall discuss dr and lee - lee - kim bound entangled states and their generalization .",
    "all these belong to the class of dr - cirac states .",
    "dr  @xcite found that for @xmath91 the following state is bound entangled : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is an @xmath0-partite ghz state ; @xmath94 is a projector onto the state @xmath95 ; and @xmath96 projects on to @xmath97 .",
    "it has been shown that this state violates the mermin - klyshko - bell inequality for @xmath98  @xcite , and that it violates a three - setting bell inequality for @xmath99  @xcite and a functional bell inequality for @xmath100  @xcite . from the experimental point of view , it is better to have a range of parameters that the bound entangled states reside in , as this results in less stringent requirements on the experimental errors  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for @xmath91 the family of states @xmath101 are bound entangled if @xmath102 and is still entangled but not bound entangled for @xmath103 .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the negativities of @xmath104 with respect to the two different partitions @xmath105 and @xmath106 are    @xmath107/{n}\\,\\right\\ } , \\\\   & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\cal n}_{12:3\\cdots   n}\\big(\\rho_{\\rm d}(x)\\big)=x.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in contrast to smolin s state , the four - qubit dr s states have zero negativity with respect to a 1:234 partition but non - zero negativity with respect to a 12:34 partition .    instead of the original form by dr  @xcite ,",
    "we can rewrite @xmath108 as a mixture of ghz - like states as follows , @xmath109 where @xmath110 where @xmath111 ( @xmath74 ) in the exponent of @xmath112 corresponds to @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "therefore , we can also rewrite @xmath104 as @xmath115 which suggests a way to create this state by mixing up various ghz - like states , with the probabilities being the corresponding coefficients .",
