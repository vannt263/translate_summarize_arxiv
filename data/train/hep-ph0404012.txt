    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) quantifies how flat the inflaton potential must be and is known as the `` fine - tuning '' problem in inflation .",
    "three approaches have been taken toward this required flat potential characterized by a small ratio of mass scales .",
    "first , some simply say that there are many as yet unexplained hierarchies in physics , and inflation requires another one .",
    "the hope is that all these hierarchies will someday be explained . in these cases ,",
    "the tiny coupling @xmath12 is simply postulated _ ad hoc _ at tree level , and then must be fine - tuned to remain small in the presence of radiative corrections .",
    "but this merely replaces a cosmological naturalness problem with unnatural particle physics .",
    "second , models have been attempted where the smallness of @xmath12 is protected by a symmetry , _",
    "e.g. , _ supersymmetry . in these cases ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", @xmath12 may arise from a small ratio of mass scales ; however , the required mass hierarchy , while stable , is itself unexplained .",
    "in addition , existing models have limitations . it would be preferable if such a hierarchy , and thus inflation itself , arose dynamically in particle physics models .    hence , in 1990 we proposed a third approach , natural inflation @xcite , in which the inflaton potential is flat due to shift symmetries .",
    "nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) arise whenever a global symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "their potential is exactly flat due to a shift symmetry under @xmath13 .",
    "as long as the shift symmetry is exact , the inflaton can not roll and drive inflation , and hence there must be additional explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "then these particles become pseudo - nambu goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) , with `` nearly '' flat potentials , exactly as required by inflation . the small ratio of mass scales required by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) can easily be accommodated .",
    "for example , in the case of the qcd axion , this ratio is of order @xmath14 .",
    "while inflation clearly requires different mass scales than the axion , the point is that the physics of pngbs can easily accommodate the required small numbers gev , the axion self - coupling is @xmath15 .",
    "( this simply reflects the hierarchy between the qcd and gut scales , which arises from the slow logarithmic running of @xmath16 . ) due to the nonlinearly realized global symmetry , the potential for pngbs is exactly flat at tree level .",
    "the symmetry may be explicitly broken by loop corrections , as in schizon @xcite and axion @xcite models . in the case of axions , for example",
    ", the pngb mass arises from non - perturbative gauge - field configurations ( instantons ) through the chiral anomaly . when the associated gauge group becomes strong at a mass scale @xmath17 ,",
    "instanton effects give rise to a periodic potential of height @xmath18 for the pngb field @xcite .",
    "since the nonlinearly realized symmetry is restored as @xmath19 , the flatness of the pngb potential is natural in the sense of t hooft @xcite . ] .",
    "we first proposed this model and performed a simple analysis in @xcite .",
    "then , in 1993 , we followed with a second paper which provides a much more detailed study @xcite .",
    "the results of section iii of the second paper , which presents a careful analysis of the dynamics of the natural inflaton , are of particular relevance here .",
    "many types of candidates have subsequently been explored for natural inflation .",
    "for example @xcite used shift symmetries in kahler potentials to obtain a flat potential and drive natural chaotic inflation in supergravity .",
    "additionally , @xcite examined natural inflation in the context of extra dimensions and @xcite used pngbs from little higgs models to drive hybrid inflation . also , @xcite and",
    "@xcite use the natural inflation idea of pngbs in the context of braneworld scenarios to drive inflation .",
    "freese @xcite suggested using a pngb as the rolling field in double field inflation @xcite ( in which the inflaton is a tunneling field whose nucleation rate is controlled by its coupling to a rolling field ) .",
    "we will focus in this paper on the original version of natural inflation , in which there is a single rolling field ; we will comment further on other variants of natural inflation in section 6 .    in the current paper",
    "we show that the original proposal of natural inflation is live and well , contrary to recent criticisms ( which we address in section 3 ) . in particular",
    ", the single - field version of the model is successful for @xmath20 ( and does not require @xmath21 , contrary to the claims of @xcite ) .",
    "a second focus of the current paper is to discuss tests of natural inflation from existing and upcoming data from microwave background experiments .",
    "recent results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite are used to constrain our model , and predictions are made for upcoming experiments such as the planck satellite which will begin taking data in 2007 .",
    "we begin in section 2 by reviewing the basic idea of natural inflation . in section 3",
    "we present results of the evolution of the scalar field driving inflation , including explicit numerical calculation of the evolution of the scalar field in its potential . in section 4",
    "we discuss density fluctuations , and find the constraint on the potential due to comparison with wmap data . in section 5",
    "we compute the tensor modes from natural inflation , and discuss their detectability in upcoming microwave background experiments . in section 6 ,",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the pros and cons of having a model in which the width of the potential is of order the planck scale .",
    "here we review the original variant of natural inflation @xcite , in which a single rolling field has a flat potential due to a shift symmetry and drives inflation .",
    "whenever a global symmetry is spontaneously broken , nambu goldstone bosons arise , with a potential that is exactly flat due to a remaining shift symmetry under @xmath22 .",
    "if there is additional explicit symmetry breaking , these particles become pseudo - nambu goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) , with `` nearly '' flat potentials . the resulting pngb potential in single field models ( in four spacetime dimensions ) is generally of the form @xmath23 \\ , .\\ ] ] we will take the positive sign in eq . ( 2 ) ( this choice has no effect on our results ) and take @xmath24 , so the potential , of height @xmath25 , has a unique minimum at @xmath26 ( we assume the periodicity of @xmath9 is @xmath27 ) .",
    "we show below that , for appropriately chosen values of the mass scales , namely @xmath28 and @xmath29 gev , the pngb field @xmath9 can drive inflation .",
    "this choice of parameters indeed produces the small ratio of scale required by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , with @xmath30 .",
    "we shall assume that inflation is initiated from a state that is at least approximately thermal .",
    "in general , this is a dangerous assumption , since there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect homogeneity or thermal equilibrium prior to inflation .",
    "however , this assumption is in keeping with the motivation of a pngb potential arising from a phase transition associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in addition , such a homogeneous , thermal initial condition could naturally arise from an earlier period of inflation associated with the breaking of the global symmetry at the scale @xmath31 . for temperatures",
    "@xmath32 , the global symmetry is spontaneously broken , and the field @xmath9 describes the phase degree of freedom around the bottom of a mexican hat . since @xmath9 thermally decouples at a temperature @xmath33 , we assume it is initially laid down at random between 0 and @xmath34 in different causally connected regions . within each hubble volume ,",
    "the evolution of the field is described by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the decay width of the inflaton . in the temperature range @xmath37 ,",
    "the potential @xmath7 is dynamically irrelevant , because the forcing term @xmath38 is negligible compared to the hubble - damping term .",
    "( in addition , for axion models , @xmath19 as @xmath39 due to the high - temperature suppression of instantons @xcite . ) thus , in this temperature range , aside from the smoothing of spatial gradients in @xmath9 , the field does not evolve .",
    "finally , at @xmath40 , in regions of the universe with @xmath9 initially near the top of the potential , the field starts to roll slowly down the hill toward the minimum . in those regions , the energy density of the universe",
    "is quickly dominated by the vacuum contribution @xmath41 , and the universe expands exponentially .    to successfully solve the cosmological puzzles of the standard cosmology ,",
    "an inflationary model must satisfy a variety of constraints .",
    "we describe these constraints in the following sections .",
    "in this section we present results for the evolution of the scalar field driving natural inflation .",
    "first , we review the standard slow roll ( sr ) analysis , and then turn to the results of an exact calculation obtained by numerically solving the equations of motion . as our result",
    "we find that sufficient inflation takes place as long as @xmath42 in section 4 we will derive stronger bounds on @xmath31 from constraints on the spectral index of density fluctuations . throughout , we take @xmath2 gev . hereafter , we take the onset of inflation to take place at a field value @xmath43 , and the end of inflation to be at a field value @xmath44 .      a sufficient , but not necessary , condition for inflation is that the field be slowly rolling , _",
    "i.e. _ its motion is overdamped , @xmath45 .",
    "the sr condition implies that two conditions are met : @xmath46 and @xmath47 from eqs .. ( [ eq : sr ] ) and ( [ eq : sr2 ] ) , the existence of a broad sr regime requires @xmath48 and ends when @xmath9 reaches a value @xmath49 , at which one of the inequalities ( [ eq : sr ] ) or ( [ eq : sr2 ] ) is violated .",
    "for example , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( near the minimum of the potential ) , while for @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , as @xmath31 grows , @xmath54 approaches @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the conditions ( [ eq : sr ] ) and ( [ eq : sr2 ] ) are approximate relations . a more precise calculation using the slow roll parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "gives similar bounds .",
    "next we present exact numerical solutions of the equations of motion to substantiate our results .      in @xcite",
    ", we obtained exact numerical solutions to the equations of motion for the inflaton in the natural inflation model .",
    "we briefly recapitulate results from a numerical evolution of the scalar field found in section iii of @xcite , which provides more precise results than the simple sr analysis . without loss of generality , we take the initial velocity to be @xmath58 .    we find that the exact solution roughly reproduces the results of the sr analysis presented previously . as long as @xmath59 , the results agree to within 10% .",
    "in particular , the numerical results for the maximum field value at the start of inflation , @xmath60 , are nearly identical to the sr estimates for values of @xmath31 near @xmath61 ; they differ by @xmath62 for @xmath50 and deviate significantly as @xmath31 approaches @xmath63 from above .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the expansion @xmath64 of the universe is determined by the friedmann equation , @xmath65 .\\ ] ] inflationary expansion takes place when the potential @xmath66 dominates in the energy density . to solve the flatness and horizon problems , we demand that the scale factor of the universe inflates by at least 60 e - foldings during the sr regime ,",

    "( [ eq : sr ] ) and ( [ eq : sr2 ] ) to determine @xmath49 as a function of @xmath31 , the constraint ( [ eq : suffice ] ) determines the maximum value ( @xmath60 ) of @xmath68 consistent with sufficient inflation .",
    "the fraction of the universe with @xmath69 $ ] will inflate sufficiently .",
    "the requirement that a reasonable fraction of the universe inflate sufficiently places a bound on @xmath31 .",
    "there are two conceptually different approaches to the question of what fraction of the universe inflates sufficiently , and hence to the bound on the scale @xmath31 .",
    "the first is an `` a priori probability . '' in this ( more restrictive ) approach , one determines the fraction of the volume of the universe _ before _ inflation which will inflate sufficiently , and requires this fraction to be reasonably large . if we assume that @xmath68 is randomly distributed between 0 and @xmath70 from one horizon volume to another , the probability of being in a region of the universe that inflates enough is @xmath71 .",
    "for example , for @xmath72 , @xmath61 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , the probability is 0.7 , 0.2 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the fraction of the universe that inflates sufficiently drops precipitously with decreasing @xmath31 , and hence restricts @xmath31 to be near @xmath61 .",
    "however , this approach is unnecessarily restrictive .",
    "the second approach , namely `` a posteriori probability '' , is more sensible .",
    "here one examines the universe after inflation has taken place , and ascertains what fraction of the _ final _ volume of the universe has inflated sufficiently to look like our own .",
    "after inflation , those initial hubble volumes of the universe that did inflate end up occupying a _ much _ larger volume than those that did not .",
    "this second approach is much less restrictive and allows a lower value of @xmath31 , as shown below .",
    "we note that neither of these approaches addresses the broader ( and unsolved ) issue of how to rigorously define a measure on the space of initial conditions for inflation , since we are implicitly assuming homogeneity and thermal equilibrium",
    ". however , these arguments do serve to establish the plausibility and naturalness of the model .",
    "we now calculate the _ a posteriori _ probability of sufficient inflation .",
    "we consider the universe at the end of inflation , and calculate the fraction @xmath77 of the volume of the universe at that time which had inflated by at least 60 e - foldings : @xmath78 \\over \\int_{h/2\\pi}^{\\pi f } \\ , d\\phi_1 \\exp[3 n(\\phi_1 ) ] } .\\ ] ] here , the lower limit of integration in the denominator is the limit of validity of the semiclassical treatment of the scalar field ; the initial value of @xmath9 must exceed its quantum fluctuations , @xmath79 .",
    "this fraction @xmath77 is then the _ a posteriori _ probability of sufficient inflation .",
    "our basic result @xcite is that the _ a posteriori _ probability for inflation @xmath77 is essentially unity for @xmath31 larger than the critical value @xmath80 . as @xmath31 drops below this value , the probability given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : apost ] ) rapidly approaches 0 .",
    "hence the requirement that a significant fraction of the universe inflate sufficiently places a lower bound on the scale @xmath81    we have explicitly calculated the evolution of the scalar field in natural inflation and found that the claim of @xcite that @xmath82 is unnecessarily restrictive . the correct bound due to sufficient inflation is given by eq .",

    "one does so , however , at the expense of an unobservably small tensor component in the cmb .",
    "natural inflation has been implemented in the context of extra dimensions with varying degrees of success .",
    "recently , arkani - hamed _ et al . _",
    "@xcite examined natural inflation in the context of extra dimensions , and also found models for which the mass terms were suppressed by a symmetry with @xmath160 , similar to the work of @xcite .",
    "focusing on a wilson line in a fifth dimension , arkani - hamed _ et al .",
    "_ alternatively suggested that one might obtain large @xmath161 if the inflaton is the extra component of a gauge field propagating in the bulk .",
    "however , banks",
    "_ et al . _",
    "examined the general question of whether it is ever possible to obtain large values of @xmath162 in string theory @xcite .",
    "while their study was not exhaustive , it strongly suggests that it is not possible .",
    "generically there is a t - dual description in which small radii become large and the value of @xmath31 is small ( @xmath163 ) ; hence the model of arkani - hamed _",
    "_ does not succeed in providing large @xmath31 inflation .",
    "in addition , in a variety of regions in moduli space banks _",
    "_ find that there are low action instantons which give rise to rapidly varying contributions to the potential that effectively rescale the value of @xmath31 to the planck scale .",
    "although they do not provide an exhaustive proof , banks _",
    "_ suggest the very strong statement that natural inflation can not work in the context of string theory for @xmath82 . however , natural inflation with @xmath164 , as discussed throughout this paper , is fine .",
    "natural inflation has been implemented in brane - world scenarios as well .",
    "shift symmetries have been studied in brane inflation by firouzjahi and tye @xcite and in the work of hsu and kallosh @xcite .",
    "the four dimensional effective field theory description of some braneworld scenarios is likely to be described by the physics in this paper .",
    "the shift symmetries of natural inflation have also been used in multiple field models .",
    "freese @xcite suggested using a pngb as the rolling field in double field inflation @xcite ( in which the inflaton is a tunneling field whose nucleation rate is controlled by its coupling to a rolling field ) .",
    "kaplan and weiner have examined natural inflation - like models in the context of `` little '' fields @xcite .",
    "kawasaki _ et al . _ proposed a supergravity inflation model in which the inflaton potential is flat due to a shift symmetry , again utilizing the basic idea of natural inflation .",
    "et al . _ have discussed thermal inflation in the context of radiatively generated axion scale in supersymmetric axion models @xcite .",
    "while arguments based on theoretical prejudice are useful guidelines for model building , the ultimate test is an observational one .",
    "it is a remarkable coincidence that the borderline between consistent and inconsistent effective field theory models for inflation is roughly the same as the borderline between whether or not tensor modes are , in a practical sense , observable @xcite . in order for the tensor / scalar ratio to be large enough to be measured by foreseeable future experiments",
    ", the width of the potential must be of order @xmath164 or larger .",
    "natural inflation is still very much in the running as a candidate model for the early universe .",
    "these models are also especially attractive from a particle physics perspective because they possess a hierarchy of scales which is stable against radiative corrections .",
    "such a hierarchy is necessary for the suppression of density perturbations , but , in other models , is typically left to an unexplained fine tuning of the inflaton self - coupling to order @xmath165 . in natural inflation",
    "this heirarchy of scales arises naturally .",
    "finally , the simplest models of natural inflation predict a large enough gravitational wave component that a detection by advanced cmb measurements will be possible .",
