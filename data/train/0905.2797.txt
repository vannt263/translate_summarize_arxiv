    "when nuclear burning ceases in the core , a massive star has evolved to a red or blue supergiant ( radius @xmath4 or @xmath5 , respectively ) and is comprised of a central , compact chandrasekhar - mass electron - degenerate iron core ( @xmath6 ) that is surrounded by an onion - skin structure of shells of material with successively lower mean atomic weight . supported only by increasingly relativistically - degenerate electrons",

    "the inner core is compressed from densities of @xmath7 to nuclear density ( @xmath8 ) where the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) stiffens and stabilizes the inner core .",

    "this is the fundamental question and primary unsolved problem of core - collapse sn theory .",

    "the _ neutrino - driven mechanism _ ( or simply , _ neutrino mechanism _ ) , is founded on the notion that if only a small fraction of the @xmath20 of gravitational energy liberated in collapse and emitted in neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors was deposited in the stellar mantle , it could be driven to explosion .",
    "the neutrino mechanism , based on the charged - current absorption of @xmath21 and @xmath22 on neutrons and protons , respectively , was first proposed by colgate & white  @xcite and arnett  @xcite and was initially envisioned to be efficient and direct , that is , expected to drive the shock out before it has time to stall .",
    "however , simulations with improved numerics and input microphysics showed that neutrino energy deposition ( `` neutrino heating '' ) is actually rather inefficient and the shock always stalls first and may be revived only on a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds in the _ delayed neutrino mechanism _ proposed by bethe & wilson  @xcite .",
    "the amount of energy to be delivered by the mechanism , @xmath23 , is set by the sum of asymptotic explosion energy of @xmath15 and the gravitational binding energy of the mantle ( also of the order of @xmath16 ) that must first be overcome .",
    "hence , @xmath24 is the fraction of the total energy that must be transferred to the mantle by neutrinos to power an explosion .",
    "this @xmath25 must be provided to the shock within a short , @xmath26 time frame after bounce in order for the onset of explosion to occur before accretion has pushed the pns over its maximum mass and for the sn to leave behind a ns mass consistent with observations .",

    "while the gw emission in these models at intermediate times stems from @xmath112 harmonics of the then dominant @xmath113 mode , an @xmath112 eigenmode at higher frequencies appears dominant at times @xmath114 , explaining the increase of the gw amplitudes around the onset of explosion .",
    "the pns core pulsations of the acoustic mechanism are the strongest gw emission mechanism proposed in the stellar collapse context .",
    "predicted strain amplitudes range up to @xmath115 ( at @xmath59 , @xcite ) and total gw energies are @xmath116 and above , emitted in a narrow frequency band set by the pns pulsation frequencies and their temporal evolutions .",
    "the right panel of , contrasting @xmath62 spectra with detector design sensitivities , demonstrates that a galactic sn exploding via the acoustic mechanism would be difficult to miss even with first - generation detectors .",
    "each of the three sn mechanism that i consider in this article has an unique multi - d dynamical process intimately linked with it . the acoustic mechanism , while involving neutrino - driven convection and sasi , is fundamentally reliant on non - linear pns core pulsations to drive the acoustic sn engine . in the magnetorotational mechanism ,",
    "on the other hand , rapid rotation is the key ingredient , damping convection and sasi , and facilitating b - field amplification and a bipolar jet - driven explosion .",
    "finally , the neutrino mechanism s key multi - d aspect is convection and sasi .",
    "while pns core pulsations could certainly be excited , they would not have time to grow to large amplitudes if the neutrino mechanism was effective and launched an early explosion .    now , as delineated in the previous sections and portrayed by figures [ fig : convgw]@xmath117[fig : gmodegw ] , the three distinct multi - d processes dominant in the three sn mechanisms have very different gw emission characteristics : ( 1 ) convection and sasi of the neutrino mechanism lead to a low - amplitude , broadband `` stochastic '' signal . ( 2 ) the rapid rotation necessary for the magnetorotational mechanism is reflected in gws by a strong axisymmetric burst at core bounce and a possible prolonged narrowband postbounce gw signal from nonaxisymmetric dynamics .",
    "( 3 ) the strong pns core pulsations of the acoustic mechanism  if they obtain  emit copiously in narrow intervals about their characteristic frequencies .    with the above information a simple picture can be drawn ( ) , relating a particular sn mechanism with a particular flavor of multi - d dynamics and an unique gw signature . hence , with an observation of gws from a core - collapse sn , the first strong observational constraints could be put on the sn mechanism .",
    "the magnetorotational and acoustic mechanisms should be clearly visible throughout the milky way with initial and enhanced interferometric detector technology while advanced and probably third - generation observatories ( e.g. , et @xcite ) may be needed to constrain the sn mechanism for core - collapse events at @xmath118 out to which the integrated sn rate is @xmath119  @xcite . due to the low - amplitude , broadband nature of its gw emission ,",
    "the neutrino mechanism is the most difficult to detect in gws , but a non - detection of gws from a galactic event with initial and enhanced detectors would quite clearly rule out the other two candidate mechanisms .",
    "the way in which i have portrayed the candidate sn mechanisms and their gw signatures in this article is idealized : i have focussed only on the primary multi - d dynamics in each mechanism and its associated gw emission , neglecting contributions from secondary and , in particular , low - frequency components , such as gws from anisotropic neutrino emission , magnetic stresses , or explosion asymmetries ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "i have also neglected the possibility of the combined action of multiple mechanisms .",
    "for example , an explosion could be driven by a combination of neutrino heating and mhd processes in a moderately rapidly rotating sn . yet , even in such a case , the dominant dynamical multi - d component would also dominate the gw emission and the simple scheme displayed in is essentially preserved .",
    "further theoretical and physically more complete and accurate computational work is necessary to gain a better understanding of the various possible sn mechanisms and of the details of their gw signatures .",
    "but , as i have attempted to show in this article , even with current knowledge , the gw signal of a galactic sn today may very likely provide strong hints for one mechanism and/or smoking - gun evidence against another .",
