    "in the past several decades , the huge numbers of data from x - ray satellites make it possible to deeply investigate the spectra of x - ray binaries , including black holes x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) and neutron star x - ray binaries ( nsxbs ) .",
    "usually , the hard x - ray tails , i.e. the x - ray spectra higher than dozens of kev , e.g. above @xmath040 kev , have been observed in bhxbs .",
    "it is a nature assumption that the hard tails are resulted from comptonization of seed photons by high - energy electrons . in bhxbs ,",
    "the high - energy electrons exist in two scenarios ( see review of done et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the hard states of bhxbs ,",
    "the energetic electrons are assumed to exist in the optically thin part between the black hole and an optically thick truncated disk far from the black hole , where the high - energy electrons are thermalized and share maxwellian distribution , and the emitting spectrum can be described by thermal comptonization in which the soft photons from the disk are inversely comptonized by these thermal electrons ( shapiro et al .",
    "1976 ; sunyaev & truemper 1979 ; sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "while , in the soft states the high - energy electrons are described by a `` hybrid '' distribution , i.e. a mixture with thermal distribution and non - thermal power - law ( pl ) distribution ( poutanen & coppi 1998 ; coppi 1999 ; gierliski et al . 1999 ; zdziarski et al . 2001 ) ; the thermal electrons might come from the remains of the hot inner flow and the non - thermal electrons might originate from the magnetic flares above the disk ( done et al .",
    "another alternative mechanism for generation of hard x - ray tails in bhxbs is the the bulk - motion comptonization ( bmc ) , in which the seed photons are inversely comptonized by the electrons which freely fall with relativistic speed onto the black holes ( titarchuk et al .",
    "1997 ; laurent & titarchuk 1999 ) .",
    "nsxbs are divided into two types , i.e. atoll sources and z sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray tails have been detected in a few atoll sources .",
    "the presence of a pl hard tail in the broadband spectra of atoll sources can trace back to such detection from the _ bepposax _ observations for 4u 0614 + 091 ( piraino et al .",
    "1999 ) . with _ integral _ observations , paizis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) detected a hard tail in gx 13 + 1 , which makes it the first atoll source with a hard tail .",
    "then , this non - thermal pl hard tail with @xmath1=2.76 was detected in the _ integral _ spectrum of 4u 1636 - 53 during its soft state ( fiocchi et al .",
    "a pl hard tail with photon index of @xmath02.4 was also found in the _ integral _ spectrum of 4u 1820 - 30 during its island state ( is ) ( tarana et al . 2007 ) .",
    "afterward , the similar hard tail having a photon index ( @xmath1 ) @xmath02.9 and contributing @xmath011% of the total flux in the 0.1 - 200 kev energy interval was detected in 4u 1705 - 44 from a _ bepposax _ observation ( piraina et al .",

    "due to the high ratio of the radio flux to the peak x - ray flux found in 4u 1636 - 53 , fiocchi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) considered that the synchrotron emission in the jet could be responsible for the detected hard tail .",

    "however , the detection of hard x - ray tails in z sources is unpredictable and the detected hard tails present complicated behaviors .",
    "generally , among the z sources , the hard tail is detected on the horizontal branch ( hb ) and it gradually fades away as they moves along the `` z '' track on their hardness - intensity diagrams ( hids ) ( di salvo et al . 2000 , 2002 ; lin et al .",
