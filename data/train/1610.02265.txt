    "this paper is concerned with the theoretical analysis and numerical treatment of integral equations of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes a patchwise smooth boundary of some bounded domain @xmath3 .",
    "a typical example is given by the second kind fredholm integral equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the _ harmonic double layer potential operator _ on @xmath6 which naturally arises from the so - called _ indirect method _ for dirichlet problems for laplace s equation in @xmath7 .",
    "for details and further references , see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3.4 ) , as well as @xcite .",
    "indirect methods obviously provide a reduction of the problem dimension .",
    "therefore , in recent years , much effort has been spend to design efficient numerical schemes for the solution to these kind of equations such as , e.g. , the multipole method @xcite , the panel clustering @xcite or the adaptive cross approximation @xcite . in particular , one of the major computational bottlenecks is given by the fact that the discretization of ( [ eq : generaleq ] ) usually leads to densely populated matrices . in this",
    "regard , wavelet - based approaches provide striking advantages , since the wavelet s vanishing moment property can be used to design very powerful compression strategies @xcite . although these algorithms turned out to be quite successful when dealing with classical test problems , for real - world problems involving millions of unknowns , it is necessary to further enhance efficiency by means of adaptive strategies .",
    "in the meantime , fully adaptive wavelet methods which are guaranteed to converge with optimal order have been established @xcite .",
    "although reliable error estimators for boundary integral operators exist and optimal convergence of traditional boundary element discretizations have been proven , see , e.g. , @xcite , we are not aware of any other method which is also _ computationally _ optimal .",
    "although the numerical experiments performed so far have been quite promising , one principle problem remains . besides numerical evidence ,",
    "it is of course very desirable to derive rigorous statements under which conditions the use of adaptive algorithms for ( [ eq : generaleq ] ) really pays off in practice . given a dictionary @xmath8 in the corresponding solution space , the best one could expect is that the adaptive algorithm realizes the convergence rate of the associated best @xmath9-term approximation with respect to @xmath8 which is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath10 denote a ( quasi- ) normed space and let @xmath11 be some countable subset of @xmath10",
    ". then @xmath12 defines the error of the _",
    "best @xmath9term approximation _ to some element @xmath13 with respect to the _ dictionary _ @xmath8 in the ( quasi- ) norm of @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath14 and @xmath15 may depend on @xmath13 in an arbitrary way , this reflects how well we can approximate @xmath13 using a finite linear combination of elements in @xmath8 .",
    "these linear combinations obviously form a highly non - linear manifold in the linear space @xmath10 . of course , to get a reasonable result concerning the achievable rate of best @xmath9term approximations , additional information ( such as further smoothness properties ) of the target function @xmath13 is needed .",
    "this is usually modeled by its membership in some additional ( quasi- ) normed space  @xmath16 .",
    "hence , if @xmath16 denotes such a space which is embedded into @xmath10 , then we may study the asymptotic decay of @xmath17 if the dictionary consists of a wavelet basis , it is indeed possible to construct optimal adaptive algorithms .",
    "that is , these schemes are guaranteed to converge with optimal order ( i.e. , they realize the convergence rate of best @xmath9term wavelet approximation as defined above ) , while their computational costs stay proportional to the used number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can state that , in the wavelet setting , adaptivity really pays if the convergence order of best @xmath9term approximation is strictly higher than the corresponding rate for classical non - adaptive algorithms . in this regard",
    ", it has been shown that the convergence order of ( [ def_sigma ] ) w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath18norm is determined by the maximal regularity @xmath19 of the @xmath20-variate function under consideration in the so  called _ adaptivity scale _ of _ besov spaces _",
    "@xmath21 where for all @xmath22 , @xmath23 see , e.g. , @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the convergence order of classical ( uniform ) algorithms is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the maximal regularity of the exact solution in the @xmath18sobolev scale , i.e. , @xmath26 ; see , e.g. , @xcite for details . in conclusion ,",
    "the use of adaptivity is justified if the smoothness @xmath19 of the exact solution @xmath13 to ( [ eq : generaleq ] ) in the adaptivity scale ( [ adaptivityscale ] ) of besov spaces is higher than its sobolev regularity @xmath25 .    for partial differential equations on bounded domains , a lot of positive results in this direction exist ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "quite recently , in @xcite , also a positive result for integral operators on two  dimensional patchwise smooth manifolds has been derived .",
    "it has turned out that for a large class of operators , including the second kind fredholm integral equation ( [ doublelayerprob ] ) for the double layer potential operator ( [ dlp ] ) , the besov smoothness of the solution in the adaptivity scale can be up to twice as high as the sobolev regularity , so that adaptivity definitely makes sense .",
    "nevertheless , one important issue still has to be discussed .",
    "of course , the estimate in ( [ ratebesov ] ) is of asymptotic nature , so that it is not clear that the advantage of adaptivity can really be observed in numerical practice .",
    "for example , it might happen that some of the involved constants are so large that the asymptotic behavior becomes significant only for values of @xmath9 which are far beyond any practical feasibility .",
    "it is one of the major goals of this paper to convince the reader that this is actually not the case . in order to do so , we performed numerical experiments that go far beyond trivial toy problems .",
    "we considered the double layer potential operator on patchwise smooth manifolds .",
    "our test cases , e.g. , the fichera vertex , are chosen in such a way that non - trivial singularities in the solution may show up at the interfaces .",
    "it turns out that the adaptive wavelet bem indeed completely resolves all the singularities without any a priori information on the refinement strategy .",
    "we designed test cases where the solutions provably possess a relatively small sobolev smoothness , but twice as much besov regularity . and indeed , the adaptive wavelet algorithm converges twice as fast as the corresponding uniform scheme that simply uses all wavelets up to a given refinement level .",
    "finally , we like to emphasize that our numerical realizations are in complete accordance with the theory development in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in , we start with some preparations concerning the parametrization of surfaces . in addition , here we define a scale of weighted sobolev spaces  @xmath27 which is needed to formulate our theoretical results",
    ". we also present a short introduction to the theory of layer potentials as far as it is needed for our purposes ( see ) .",
    "moreover , we discuss the basic properties of the wavelet bases that are required for the use in adaptive algorithms . in ,",
    "we define besov - type spaces @xmath28 as introduced in @xcite and clarify their relations to best @xmath9term wavelet approximation .",
    "our main besov regularity results for solutions to integral equations are briefly summarized in .",
    "is dedicated to the adaptive wavelet method .",
    "we survey on the basic ingredients needed to realize an algorithm that realizes asymptotically optimal complexity . by asymptotically optimal we mean that any target accuracy can be achieved at a computational expense that stays proportional the number of degrees of freedom that is needed to approximate the solution by @xmath9term approximation with the same accuracy .",
    "numerical results are then presented in .",
    "they are in good agreement with the theory . finally , in , we state some concluding remarks .",

    "in this paper , we consider lipschitz surfaces @xmath38 which are boundaries of bounded , simply connected , closed domains @xmath40 with polyhedral structure and finitely many quadrilateral sides . w.l.o.g .",
    "we can assume all these sides to be flat with corresponding straight edges ; cf .",

    "we will pursue essentially two different ( but equivalent ) approaches to describe @xmath38 , where both of them will be used later on .",
    "for the first approach , consider the patchwise decomposition @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the closure of the @xmath43th ( open ) _ patch _ of @xmath38 which is a subset of some affine hyperplane in @xmath0 , bounded by a closed polygonal chain connecting exactly four points ( _ vertices _ @xmath44 of  @xmath7 ) . here",
    ", we only require that the partition ( [ partition ] ) is essentially disjoint in the sense that the intersection of any two patches @xmath45 , @xmath46 , is either empty , a common edge , or a common vertex of @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we will assume the existence of ( sufficiently smooth ) diffeomorphic parametrizations @xmath47 ^ 2 { \\rightarrow}\\overline{f_i } , \\qquad i=1,\\ldots , i,\\ ] ] which map the unit square onto these patches .",
    "finally , we define the class of _ patchwise smooth functions _ on @xmath38 by @xmath48    in the second approach , the surface of @xmath7 is modeled ( locally ) in terms of the boundary of its tangent cones @xmath49 , subordinate to the vertices @xmath50 of @xmath7 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the boundary of the infinite cone @xmath49 consists of @xmath52 essentially disjoint , open plane sectors ( called _ faces _ ) which will be denoted by @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 it will be convenient to use local polar coordinates @xmath55 in each of these faces  @xmath56 .",
