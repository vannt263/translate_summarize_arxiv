    "in euclidean space @xmath1 , the plane and the catenoid are the only minimal rotational surfaces .",
    "these surfaces are foliated by a uniparametric family of coaxial circles .",
    "we consider now a more general context and we ask for those minimal surfaces foliated by a uniparametric family of circles in parallel planes , called cyclic surfaces @xcite .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that , besides the rotational surfaces , the surface must be one of the classical family of minimal surfaces discovered by riemann @xcite .",
    "similarly , the only cyclic surfaces in @xmath1 with zero gaussian curvature are rotational surfaces , or generalized cones @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is to consider cyclic surfaces in sol@xmath0 space and to classify them under the assumptions of minimality and flatness .",
    "this space is a simply connected homogeneous @xmath2-manifold and it belongs to one of the eight models of the geometry of thurston @xcite . as a riemannian manifold",
    ", the space sol@xmath0 can be represented by @xmath3 equipped with the metric @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the canonical coordinates of @xmath3 .",
    "the space sol@xmath0 is a lie group with the group operation @xmath6 and the metric @xmath7 is left - invariant .",
    "recently , there is an activity on the study of submanifolds in sol@xmath0 , see for example @xcite .",
    "recall that in sol@xmath0 there is not a group of rotations as in the euclidean space @xmath1 , that is , a uniparametric continuous group of direct isometries that leave pointwise a geodesic .",
    "however , a rotational surface in @xmath1 is also characterized as a surface foliated by the uniparametric circles @xmath8 all contained in planes @xmath9 whose centers form a straight line orthogonal to each @xmath9 . in sol@xmath0",
    "we have all these concepts , such as geodesic , totally geodesic surface , and distance . under this viewpoint",
    ", we carry the next definition :    a circle in sol@xmath0 is a curve contained in a totally geodesic surface @xmath10 and equidistant from a fixed point of @xmath10 , called the center of the circle .",
    "we point out that the distance in the circle is computed with the induced metric on @xmath10 by sol@xmath0 , which agrees with the one induced on the curve by the metric of the ambient space because @xmath10 is totally geodesic .",
    "we recall that in sol@xmath0 the totally geodesic surfaces are the vertical planes @xmath9 of equation @xmath11 and the planes @xmath12 of equation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 . here",
    "we use the notion of vertical and horizontal in its usual affine concept of the set @xmath3 , where the space sol@xmath0 is modeled .    by analogy with what happens in euclidean space , we give the next definition .",
    "a cyclic surface in sol@xmath0 is a surface foliated by a uniparametric family of circles contained in the planes @xmath9 ( resp .",
    "contained in the planes @xmath12 ) . if the centers of these circles form a geodesic line orthogonal to each plane @xmath9 ( resp .",
    "each plane @xmath12 ) , then we say that the surface is rotational .    motivated by the results of euclidean space @xmath1",
    ", we ask for those cyclic surfaces in sol@xmath0 that are minimal ( zero mean curvature ) or flat ( zero gaussian curvature ) .",
    "for example , we ask about the existence of rotational surfaces or surfaces with the same role as riemann minimal examples .",
    "because the study of cyclic surfaces foliated by circles in the planes @xmath9 is analogous to the ones foliated by circles in the planes @xmath12 , we will assume in this paper that the cyclic surfaces are always foliated by circles in the totally geodesic planes of type @xmath9 .    in this sense ,",
    "we obtain :    [ t1 ] there are no minimal cyclic surfaces in sol@xmath0 .",
    "[ t2 ] there are no flat cyclic surfaces in sol@xmath0 .    both theorems will be proved in section [ se-3 ] . on the other hand , recall that the planes @xmath9 are isometric to the hyperbolic plane @xmath15 and the circles in @xmath9 are curves with constant curvature @xmath16 , @xmath17 . however , in the hyperbolic plane there are other curves with constant curvature @xmath16 , but @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , these curves are geodesics , equidistant lines and horocycles .",
    "therefore , we ask for minimal or flat cyclic surfaces foliated by these curves . in this context , we obtain in section [ se-4 ] all minimal or flat cyclic surfaces foliated by geodesics , equidistant lines , or horocycles .",
    "see theorems [ t3 ] and [ t4 ] .",
    "the isometry group of sol@xmath0 has dimension @xmath2 and the component of the identity is generated by the following families of isometries : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a real parameter .",
    "these isometries are left multiplications by elements of sol@xmath0 and so , they are left - translations with respect to the structure of the lie group . the sol@xmath0 space has the next three foliations : @xmath21 the foliations @xmath22 and @xmath23 are determined by the isometry groups @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , and they describe the ( only ) totally geodesic surfaces of sol@xmath0 , each leaf of the foliation being isometric to a hyperbolic plane .",
    "the foliations @xmath26 are minimal surfaces , all of them being isometric to the euclidean plane .    with respect to the metric @xmath7 , an orthonormal basis of left - invariant vector fields",

    "the center of the circle @xmath44 is the point @xmath45 and the hyperbolic radius is @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the circle @xmath44 is viewed in sol@xmath0 as @xmath47 and its parametrization is then @xmath48 see figure [ fig1 ] . on the other hand",
    ", we consider the foliation @xmath49 of the ambient space .",
    "the geodesics of sol@xmath0 intersecting orthogonally each plane of @xmath50 are the horizontal lines of equation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .     in a plane",

    "we obtain a cyclic surface by considering the constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 as functions of the variable @xmath59 .",
    "the parametrization of the surface is then @xmath60 and @xmath61 is an open interval .",
    "because our results are local , we only need to compute @xmath62 and @xmath63 when the variable @xmath64 is defined in some open interval of @xmath65 , that is , when we have an arc of a circle .",
    "thus we can consider in the parametrizations and that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is an open interval .",
    "then in the statements of the results we change foliated by circles by foliated by arcs of circles.    since in this paper we study surfaces with zero mean curvature or zero gaussian curvature , the equations @xmath68 and @xmath69 are , respectively , equivalent to @xmath70 and @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a normal vector field to the surface but no necessarily unitary . it will be with both equations as we will obtain our results .",
    "the proof of our results consists in substituting parametrization into and , obtaining a polynomial of type @xmath73 for some natural number @xmath74 . for each fixed @xmath75",
    ", we view this expression as a polynomial in @xmath64 ; recall that @xmath64 belongs to an interval of @xmath65 . because the functions @xmath76 are linearly independent , all coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 vanish .",
    "the explicit computations of and are straightforward , but complicated",
    ". we use a symbolic program as mathematica to check these computations .    in the simplest expressions",
    "correspond to the leader coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 . using the equations @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    ", we get information that will be used in determining the next coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 and we repeat the process until we find our results .",
    "( of theorem [ t1 ] ) using parametrization of a cyclic surface in sol@xmath0 we compute @xmath85 and we choose the normal vector @xmath86 after some manipulations , the minimality condition yields an expression of type with @xmath87 where @xmath88 because @xmath89 , we conclude @xmath90 , which is a contradiction .",

    "@xmath91 from @xmath89 , we have @xmath92 .",
    "however this is a contradiction with the fact that a circle @xmath93 in @xmath9 must satisfy the condition @xmath43 , see .",
