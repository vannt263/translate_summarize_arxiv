    "the anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays in the tev band has received renewed attention in recent years .",
    "a variety of experiments @xcite have reported results on the amplitude of the first harmonic in the siderial anisotropy , which is typically found to be slightly less than @xmath0 .",
    "all experiments see only part of the sky , and it is not easy to reconstruct an allsky dipole anisotropy , largely because the energy dependence of the acceptance is different among the various detectors . in any case , the true dipole anisotropy can be slightly higher than the sidereal first harmonic , i.e. @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , significant small - scale anisotropy was observed that has not met an accepted explanation to date , although it is tempting to attribute it to the local structure of the turbulent magnetic field in the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here we investigate whether or not the dipole anisotropy can be reproduced with models of galactic cosmic - ray propagation that are tuned to fit available data on secondary - to - primary ratios and the survival fraction of unstable isotopes . for that purpose",
    "we use a green - function method that solves a time - dependent diffusion equation , similar to @xcite .",
    "diffusion equations of this type are derived by averaging the original fokker - planck transport equation for the isotropic part of the cosmic - ray distribution function . by construction ,",
    "anisotropy in this treatment arises only from the diffusive ( and possibly drift or convective ) flux and is always dipolar in nature .",
    "modeling the small - scale anisotropy , on the other hand , would be described with a transport equation derived from the original fokker - planck equation for the anisotropic part of the cosmic - ray distribution and is not considered here .",
    "our time - dependent treatment permits accounting for a discrete nature of cosmic - ray source .",
    "a similar technique was used to model variations in the spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons and cosmic - ray ions @xcite .",
    "we test various cosmic - ray source distributions in galactocentric radius , using the appropriate transport parameters , and compute the expected temporal evolution of the anisotropy .",
    "this approach permits a realistic assessment of the likelihood to find a certain anisotropy for a specific choice of parameters .",
    "the occasionally discussed mean variance of the anisotropy is a considerably less useful quantity , because the distribution of anisotropy amplitudes is highly skewed .",
    "we are particularly interested in the temporal and spectral correlations between flux and anisotropy fluctuations .",
    "our approach is ideally suited to recover these correlations and investigate their effect , when we compute flux and anisotropy over a finite spectral acceptance and compare with observational results .",
    "the differential density of tev - band cosmic rays obeys a continuity equation that can be written as @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 is the distance from the source , and @xmath5 is the differential production rate at the source .",
    "note that we neglect stochastic reacceleration , advection , and energy losses .",
    "the first and the last of that list should only be important at gev energies and below , at least for cosmic - ray protons .",
    "the case of advection is less clear , but probably also less important than it may be in the gev band on account of the energy dependence of diffusive propagation .    using standard methods",
    "@xcite one derives a general solution to the transport equation , assuming impulsive injection of particle at time @xmath6 , @xmath7 if more than one source contributes to the local cosmic - ray flux at any time , their individual contributions must be calculated using equation  [ n - eq ] and then summed .",
    "we now modify the solution to account for a finite size and lifetime of sources and for escape from the galaxy .",
    "it is known that assuming a point source in space and time can lead to singularities in the cosmic - ray density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "real cosmic - ray sources , whatever their nature , have a finite spatial extent and confine the accelerated particles for some time , for the acceleration is not instantaneous . the most simple method to represent extended sources is to assume that they have the shape of a thin , spherical shell of radius @xmath8 .",
    "the correspondence to the shell of a young supernova remnant is obvious , but the applicability of the ansatz is not limited to snr . in any case , averaging over the shell yields @xmath9\\,\\sum_\\pm\\,(\\pm 1)\\ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(r\\mp r)^2}{4\\,d\\,t}\\right)\\ .",
    "\\label{n - eq1}\\ ] ] note that this solution still has a singularity for @xmath10 at @xmath11 , which will disappear when we average over a finite lifetime , because asymptotically @xmath12 for @xmath10 .",
    "we do need to account for source size in computing the anisotropy , which is given by the diffusive flux , @xmath13 for small argument of the @xmath14 term , the first and last term on the rhs cancel each other .    for the integration over the time of source activity",
    ", we choose the most simple form of a temporal profile , namely a constant source rate over an age interval @xmath15 $ ] with the constraint that both @xmath16 and @xmath17 be positive . the time integral can be easily performed analytically , but leads to very small differences of exponentials and error functions that are more difficult to numerically implement than a simple numerical integration .",
    "a fact that we shall employ below is that either escape is irrelevant or the effects of the finite extent of lifetime of the sources are negligible , provided the source lifetime is much smaller than the escape time .",
    "diffusive escape from the galaxy can be modeled using dirichlet boundary conditions at some distance from the midplane of the galaxy , @xmath18 .",
    "obviously , the boundary conditions break the spherical symmetry of the problem .",
    "whereas for very rare sources analytical approximations may ease the treatment @xcite , in the tev band we expect cosmic - ray sources to appear with a rate @xmath19 , implying a relatively small distance to the nearest source .",
    "consequently , we attempt a full solution by using the method of mirror sources .",
    "since we have two boundaries , an infinite series of mirror sources with alternating sign is needed @xcite .    for the mirror sources only the gaussian factor in equation",
    "[ n - eq1 ] is relevant .",
    "it is accurate to second order in the ratio of source lifetime and escape time to use an average age , @xmath20 .",

    "in fact , the anisotropy in the intensity of cosmic - ray electrons at energies between 60  gev and 480  gev has only recently been measured @xcite . in the case of electrons",
    ", we need to account for their energy losses , but may neglect escape , at least above @xmath2360  gev .",
    "hence , we may describe the propagation of electrons at energies higher than a few gev by a simplified , time - dependent transport equation @xmath24 where we consider continous energy losses by synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering , a diffusion coefficient @xmath25 dependent on energy , and a source term , @xmath26 .",
    "green s function for this problem can be found in the literature @xcite .",

    "we now run 100 simulations for each parameter combination .",
    "unless the number of cosmic - ray sources is very small , and hence intermittency effects dominate , the source distribution is a critical factor in anisotropy studies .",

    "the comprehensive analysis of fermi - lat data by @xcite also suggests a gradient in @xmath55 , albeit a weaker trend as in .",

    "having established that a rather flat source distribution is necessary to explain the low anisotropy amplitude measured at multi - tev energies , we now discuss light curves .",
    "we want to infer the temporal and spectral correlations between flux and anisotropy fluctuations , which must be taken into account when computing the flux and anisotropy over a finite spectral acceptance and comparing with observational results .",
    "a number of insights can be gained by first discussing light curves at specific energies . figure  [ pe : f4 ] shows the temporal variations of proton flux , proton anisotropy , and electron anisotropy for the standard parameters with halo size @xmath68  kpc and a shallow source distribution ( see table  [ t1f ] ) .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows :        * the proton flux displays small - amplitude fluctuations with rare , short - lived spikes , a result already discussed by @xcite . *",
    "spikes in flux are generally accompagnied by spikes in anisotropy at all energies and reflect the appearance with nearby , young cosmic - ray sources .",
    "the events may change the diffusion coefficient on account of streaming instabilities , in which case this calculation would overestimate the anisotropy during spikes . *",
    "deep , short - lived dips can be observed in the anisotropy , which have no counterpart in the flux and do not appear at all energies .",
    "these dips arise from a random balancing of the contributions of the dominant cosmic - ray sources and are therefore a hallmark of discrete sources .",
    "* there is little correlation between the small - amplitude fluctuations in the anisotropy at different energies , which implies that care must be exercized when comparing with airshower data , which carry contributions from cosmic - rays over a wide range of energies . *",
    "the predicted electron anisotropy is lower than the upper limits published by @xcite , but higher by a factor @xmath235 than the galprop predictions shown in their figure 9 .",
    "galprop does not properly account for discrete sources and therefore would underpredict the anisotropy .",
    "the direction of maximum intensity is almost always in the galactic plane , because the distribution of cosmic - ray sources with the vertical coordinate , @xmath69 , is very narrow . in figure",
    "[ pe : f5 ] we show how the anisotropy direction varies with time , using the same simulation as for figure  [ pe : f4 ] for ease of comparison . to be noted from the figure is the correspondence of the deep dip in anisotropy at -3.2  myr with a 360-degree swing of the anisotropy direction . generally , the variations in the anisotropy direction are large and in general not achromatic , although the difference in directions at 1.8  tev and 110  tev rarely exceeds 30 degrees .",
    "ground - based observatories do not see the entire sky and therefore resort to measuring the first harmonic in right ascension , while integrating over the declination band that is accessible to them .",
    "the projection of a first harmonic in galactic longitude depends on the direction of maximum intensity and on the declination band in question .",
    "the icecube collaboration has presented cosmic - ray anisotropy measurements in two broad energy bands @xcite , based on a total of about 30 billion cosmic - ray - induced muon events .",
    "airshowers caused by heavy primaries approximately behave like the superposition of airshowers produced by the individual nucleons . therefore",
    ", the detection with icecube of a muon with a certain energy requires a heavy primary of much higher energy than it would , if the primary were a proton . in terms of propagation , heavy cosmic rays with charge number @xmath70 and energy @xmath71",
    "will behave like protons of energy @xmath72 .",
    "thus , light and heavy cosmic - ray nuclei that have similar propagation properties , and hence similar anisotropy , will also account for muons of similar energy in icecube .",
    "we have seen in figure  [ pe : f3 ] that a factor 2 in energy on average yields a 20-% change in anisotropy .",
    "we have also seen that the spectrum of cosmic rays shows little variation , except possibly during intense spikes in flux .",
    "it is therefore a good approximation to only consider cosmic - ray protons .",
    "the icecube collaboration was kind enough to provide us with the distribution in energy of the primary particle for their 2 muon event selections , derived under the assumption that all primary cosmic rays are protons .",
    "these distributions are also shown in figure  [ pe : f6 ] .",
    "obviously the median primary particle energies are lower than for the mixed composition assumed in @xcite , but these are the distributions we need to combine with our proton - propagation calculation described in the preceding sections .",
    "icecube reports the sidereal first harmonic in the cosmic - ray intensity averaged over the declination range @xmath73 .",
    "obviously , the dependence of acceptance on the primary energy is not constant over this declination range , but we will ignore that and project the cosmic - ray dipole anisotropy onto the sidereal band at the characteristic declination @xmath74 , which is approximately the median declination of events accepted in the icecube analysis . note that we compute the direction of the cosmic - ray dipole anisotropy ( cf .",
    "figure  [ pe : f5 ] ) , which displays considerable variability , and so does its projection onto the sidereal band .",
    "a dipole anisotropy of amplitude @xmath49 pointing at declination @xmath75 provides a sideral first harmonic at declination @xmath76 of amplitude @xmath77 the denominator can essentially always be set to unity .",
    "we simulate the cosmic - ray intensity for @xmath78  myr to obtain a statistically meaningful data set . in figure",
    "[ pe : f7 ] we show the expected anisotropy in the icecube data over @xmath79  myr only for a source rate @xmath80 .",
    "the icecube collaboration reports the following sidereal anisotropies : @xmath81 the expected anisotropy is simultaneously below both values for 8.2% of the simulated time period of @xmath78  myr . even if we account for the uncertainties and set the anisotropies to @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , implying that individually there is only a 16% probability that the true anisotropy is higher , they are met at only 12.9% of the time .",
    "also shown in figure  [ pe : f7 ] is the location of peak intensity in the sidereal band studied by icecube . to be noted from the figure",
    "is that in particular during anisotropy lows the peak intensity is found far from the galactic - center direction at ra@xmath84h and not necessarily coincident for the 2 energy bands .",

    "the probability of meeting the icecube upper limits was with 11% only marginally er than for the shallow source distribution of @xcite .",
    "this is not the first calculation of cosmic - ray anisotropy in the tev band .",
    "the main advantage of this study lies in the proper accounting for the correlations between flux and anisotropy variations , a restriction to cosmic - ray propagation parameters that were deemed viable in dedicated studies , and an accurate folding with the acceptance distribution of a recent observational study .",
    "we have specifically compared with recent measurements with the icecube experiments @xcite , which leads us to the following conclusions :    * consistent with earlier findings , a cosmic - ray source distribution in the galaxy that fits to the deduced populations of pulsars or snr , combined with propagation parameters that reproduce the observed secondary - to - primary ratios , will lead to a dipole anisotropy that is higher than observed , even if source discreteness is taken into account . *",
    "also in agreement with earlier studies , a shallow energy dependence of diffusion is necessary , thus requiring a reacceleration model to fit the gev - band boron - to - carbon ratio .",
    "* for a shallow source distribution , fluctuations arising from source discreteness provide a probability of the order of 10% that the cosmic - ray anisotropy limits in the high - energy and low - energy bands of the recent icecube analysis can be simultaneously met , approximately independent of the exact choice of source rate , but less likely so for a large halo size .",
    "* the location of the intensity maximum far from the galactic center and at different locations for the 2 energy bands are naturally reproduced when source discreteness is taken into account .",
    "it is unclear what type of cosmic - ray source in the galaxy would have a distribution in the galaxy as shallow as required in our study .",
    "the question arises whether or not modifications to the description of diffusive transport can render a steep source distribution viable .",
    "the critical constraint appears to be imposed by very low dipole anisotropy in the high - energy band of icecube data , i.e. at approximately 100  tev energy per nucleon .",
    "is it possible that the extrapolation to this energy of the cosmic - ray propagation parameters does not hold ?",
    "recent data suggest that cosmic - ray spectra @xcite , and the boron - to - carbon ratio @xcite , flatten above a few hundred gev / nuc . at this time we do not have a prevalent interpretation of both the cosmic - ray spectral hardening and the flat b / c ratio above a few hundred gev / nuc",
    ". the spectral hardening of cosmic - ray primaries could simply be a fluctuation arising from source discreteness , but in that case the boron - to - carbon ratio should fall off more steeply , because the flux of cosmic - ray secondaries fluctuates very little @xcite .",
    "spectral hardening can also reflect variations in the production spectra of different sources , in which case the boron - to - carbon ratio would be unaffected .",
    "if the upturn in the boron - to - carbon ratio is , on the other hand , due to the fragmentation of primaries and the re - acceleration of secondaries inside cosmic - ray sources , then the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient can not be argued to be very shallow .",
    "the only possibility that would imply a very low anisotropy is a change of the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient at a few hundred gev / nuc , e.g. from @xmath61 to @xmath90 .",
    "speculative though that may be , the extrapolation using @xmath90 to @xmath91  ev may render viable the notion that a significant fraction of the sub - ankle cosmic - ray flux is galactic in origin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite suggested a common solution to the anisotropy and cosmic - ray gradient problems , that involves a strong toroidal magnetic field in the galaxy .",
    "diffusion perpendicular to the azimuthal magnetic field ( with coefficient @xmath92 , as opposed to @xmath93 ) would be the dominant transport mechanism , assuming field - line wandering and large - scale velocity turbulence can be ignored .",
    "the authors further posit that @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the density of cosmic - ray sources and @xmath97 .",
    "at least up to 1 tev particle energy , the predicted radial anisotropy appears to be commensurate with measured values .",
    "we posit that the scenario would do little , if anything , to resolve the 3-d anisotropy problem for discrete sources ( the authors only discuss anisotropy for continuous sources in a 2-d scenario ) . in the direction of fast diffusion ,",
    "i.e . along the large - scale toroidal magnetic field",
    ", we see particles of the same age from sources at larger distance , thus increasing their contribution to the anisotropy . the volume sampled , and thus the number of sources contributing to the local cosmic - ray flux ,",
    "will also increase , thus reducing the likelihood of a fluctuation toward low anisotropy , but not efficiently enough to overcome anisotropy arising from source discreteness . in the scenario of @xcite",
