    "we observed cena with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the atca is a 6 antenna interferometer with baselines between 30 m and 6 km .",
    "the observations were performed around the rest frequency of the @xmath15 water transition at 22.23508 ghz . to exclude cross - identification of instrumental features with the water line , we slightly shifted the central frequencies between some of the observations ( see table[tab : obs ] ) .",
    "we used the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ; * ? ? ?",

    ", the velocity range of the narrow band observations amounts to @xmath18 km  s@xmath2  for a central frequency of 22.172ghz and @xmath19 km  s@xmath2  for 22.272ghz .",
    "absolute fluxes were calibrated with the atca standard pks1934 - 638 .",
    "bandpasses were typically obtained by observing pks1253 - 055 for @xmath20min , but we used pks0537 - 441 when the former was not available at the start of the observations .",

    "the data were self - calibrated on the strong continuum emission from the core of cena  to correct phase and gain variations as a function of time .",
    "finally , we extracted spectra from the images , after robust weighting and cleaning 1000 iterations per channel .",
    "all data reduction steps were performed in miriad . whereas the narrowband observations show sufficiently flat baselines , fitted well by 0th order polynomials , the wideband observations exhibit variations of order @xmath21 per cent . given the relatively high flux density of the central source ( see table[tab : obs ] ) these variations amount to a @xmath22mjy level , and we fitted and subtracted third order polynomials to a @xmath23 km  s@xmath2  range around the water frequency for satisfactory results .",
    "given the spectral variations of the baselines , we estimate @xmath24per cent uncertainty for the absolute fluxes of the well behaved narrowband observations , and a conservative @xmath20 per cent error for the wideband data .",
    "we extracted line emission at the central position of the smbh at ra(j2000)=13@xmath2525@xmath2627@xmath276 , dec(j2000)=@xmath2843@xmath2901@xmath3009@xmath31 and subtracted the continuum emission .",
    "the wideband spectra are shown in fig.[fig : specbroad ] and the narrowband data in fig.[fig : specnarrow ] .",
    "the systemic velocity of cena is at a kinematic local standard of rest ( lsrk ) value of @xmath32 km  s@xmath2@xcite and we mark this value in the figures , assuming that the line can be identified as the @xmath15 water maser transition at a rest frequency of 22.23508ghz ( see  [ sec : id ] ) .",
    "we clearly detect a spatially unresolved emission feature at @xmath33 km  s@xmath2offset from systemic .",
    "no detections are seen at systemic and blueshifted velocities . as the narrowband observations resulted in higher quality spectra , we used these data to constrain the line properties .",
    "although the lines do not appear to be perfectly gaussian in shape , we nevertheless fitted one - component gaussians to these lines .",
    "the results are listed in table[tab : gauss ] and plotted in fig.[fig : specnarrow ] .",
    "the table contains the dates of the observations in column ( 1 ) , followed by the best fit central lsrk velocities @xmath34 , the full widths at half maximum of the fitted line @xmath35 and the peak fluxes @xmath36 in columns ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) . in column",
    "( 5 ) we list the derived isotropic luminosity values in @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting parameters reveal that the h@xmath13o  maser line is at a velocity of @xmath1 km  s@xmath2  redshifted @xmath38 km  s@xmath2  from systemic , with a width of @xmath39 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the amplitude is @xmath40mjy with the exception of the data taken on 2012 may 22 , where we find a three times higher peak flux density of @xmath41mjy .",
    "the continuum flux at this epoch is only about 30 per cent higher than the lowest measured continuum flux at all epochs , whereas the line is @xmath42 times stronger .",
    "although some continuum variations could be due to the different synthesized beam sizes of the individual observations ( see table[tab : obs ] ) , this suggests that the variation is predominantly intrinsic to cena .",
    "our observations are consistent with unresolved line emission emerging from the center of cena . for each of the 6 km array data , the beams ( see table[tab : obs ] ) correspond to physical resolutions of about @xmath43pc @xmath44pc and @xmath45pc @xmath46pc .",
    "the position angles of the two observations are separated by @xmath47 , and we can assume that the line is emitted from within the overlap region with a conservative upper limit of a maximum of @xmath5pc projected distance away from the smbh .",
    "we observe the line feature at a sky frequency of @xmath48mhz .",
    "if the line would originate in cena at its systemic velocity of 545 km  s@xmath2  lsrk , the line rest frequency would be expected to be close to a value of @xmath49mhz .",
    "adding a potential velocity offset of @xmath50 km  s@xmath2  ( or @xmath51mhz ) , the following astrophysical spectral lines other than the h@xmath13o  @xmath15 maser transition with a rest frequency of @xmath52ghz may be candidates for the emission in cena : ch@xmath53ohcho @xmath54 at a rest frequency of 22.143mhz , c@xmath55cs @xmath56 at @xmath57ghz , and cco @xmath56 at 22.258ghz .",
    "none of these lines are expected to be bright enough to explain the observed intensity . and none of them lie near systemic velocity requiring very unusual kinematics if they are within a star forming cloud that is at a projected distance no further than 3pc from the core of cena (  [ sec : loc ] ) .",
    "in addition , given the strong continuum of cena , all of the thermal lines are more likely to be detectable in absorption and not emission ( cena  has a complex molecular absorption spectrum as , e.g. , shown in * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "apart from the molecules , the h83@xmath58 radio recombination line has a rest frequency of 22.196ghz and could be a potential candidate for the emission . but given that we do not even see any h@xmath59 recombination lines in our spectra , we can exclude an identification with the much weaker h@xmath58 line .",
    "the only likely line candidate is the redshifted h@xmath13o  maser @xmath15 transition , which is by far the brightest astrophysical transition across the observed frequency range . as alluded to in the introduction (  [ sec : intro ] ) , h@xmath13o  has also been observed toward the nuclei of other active galaxies , and the maser line is the most likely one observed in emission in the presence of cena s strong continuum emission .",
    "the maser feature has a fwhm of @xmath39 km  s@xmath2 , which we can not decompose into more narrow individual maser features down to our @xmath60 km  s@xmath2  velocity resolution .",
    "we may thus assume that the line emerges from a single maser spot unless high resolution imaging will break it up into more components .",
    "the isotropic luminosity of the feature is @xmath6@xmath37 ( see table[tab : gauss ] ) .",
    "if the maser line is emitted from a single spot , it falls into the category of kilomasers .",
    "masers of similar strengths are found in nearby , moderately star forming galaxies and mergers such as m51 , ngc253 , m82 , ngc2146 , ngc3556 , ngc3620 or the antennae @xcite .",
    "it is also similar to the galaxy s most luminous water maser in w49n ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    in all but one epoch the peak of the maser feature is about 20mjy .",
    "the 2012 may 22 data , however , reveal a three times stronger line ( see  [ sec : res ] ) . the variability may be related to a merely @xmath61per cent stronger continuum flux at the time , which may indicate that the maser itself is unsaturated . to determine this",
    "conclusively , however , requires more epochs of observations , desirably at higher spatial resolution .",
    "most kilomasers are found in star formation regions of galaxies ( see references above and , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they typically arise from outflows of massive stars and show velocity spreads of up to a few tens of km  s@xmath2 . for cena",
    ", we can pinpoint the maser to within @xmath5pc projected distance from the nucleus (  [ sec : loc ] ) .",
    "we consider the probability of crossing a massive star formation region along the line of sight to be low . even if such a region is located toward that direction , the velocity offset of @xmath62 km  s@xmath2  from systemic and the linewidth of @xmath39 km  s@xmath2 would be inconsistent with a typical h@xmath13o  maser in a star forming region well outside the nuclear region .",
    "strong water masers are also observed toward the accretion disks of some smbhs ( `` disk masers '' ) and close to agn jet - ism interaction regions ( `` jet masers '' ) .",
    "typical examples for disk masers are the archetypical ngc4258 galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a larger sample of such masers have been observed in dedicated search campaigns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "disk masers typically have three main components : one at systemic velocity as well as blueshifted and redshifted line features , both offset by a few hundred km  s@xmath2 .",
    "some disks , however , lack one or two of these main components . at high velocity resolution ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the disk maser components show significant substructures at km  s@xmath2linewidth scales .",
    "they can overlap and blend to form broader components .",
    "although we may see some indications of substructure in the wideband data that was observed in 2011 ( see fig.[fig : specbroad ] ) , the overall h@xmath13o  spectrum in cena  is relatively smooth , even at the km  s@xmath2  scales of our high spectral resolution data ( fig.[fig : specnarrow ] ) .",
    "we thus consider a disk maser origin unlikely .",
    "jet masers , have been detected in ngc1068 @xcite , ngc3079 @xcite , circinus @xcite , mrk348 @xcite and possibly in ngc1052 @xcite . in particular , the jet maser in mrk348 resembles cena s maser in many respects .",
    "the line is @xmath63 km  s@xmath2  redshifted from systemic , 130 km  s@xmath2  wide and relatively smooth .",
    "very long baseline array data shows that the maser is about @xmath60pc away from the core .",
    "monitoring also shows some significant variability on timescales as short as a day and loosely correlated with the continuum strength @xcite .",
    "the isotropic luminosity of the mrk348 maser , however , is about two orders of magnitude higher than the feature in cena .",
    "we also observe similarities with the possible jet maser in ngc1052 .",
    "the h@xmath13o  line in ngc1052 is redshifted @xmath62 km  s@xmath2  from systemic with a linewidth of @xmath64 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "its isotropic luminosity is of the same order as the maser in mrk348 .",
    "given the similarities of the cenah@xmath13o  maser emission with the above cases , we discuss the implications of the jet maser model for cena  in the following section .",
    "a useful model for a jet maser has been established by @xcite .",
    "they propose that the jet plows into a neighboring molecular cloud and creates a shock front that is propagating away from the jet direction .",
    "the tip of the shock front covers a large opening angle , and the morphology resembles that of a mushroom , with cloud material being compressed toward the front and the the sides of the jet .",
    "the projected velocities of the shocked material may thus combine to the large linewidth that we witness .",
    "shocks propagate according to the density contrast between the the two media at the shock boundary via @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the density and velocity of the initial , shocking material and @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the propagating forward shock front in the material that was hit .",
    "@xcite monitored the motions of the parsec - scale jet components in cena and derived velocities of @xmath70c . for a shock that propagates with",
    "the velocity offset of the maser feature in cena , @xmath71 km  s@xmath2 , we can then derive a density contrast of @xmath72 .",
    "interstellar h@xmath13o",
    "masers require volume densities of at least @xmath73@xmath9@xcite to be pumped ( see * ? ? ? * for scenarios when radiative pumping may become important ) .",
    "when we apply the density contrast to this number we can infer an incoming jet density of @xmath74@xmath9 .",
    "geometry constraints will change the numbers but the order of magnitude estimate should remain if the shock front has a large opening angle as suggested by @xcite . the jet velocity , however , may be underestimated .",
    "@xcite shows that the northern jet is much brighter than the southern counterpart , which can be explained by doppler boosting the brightness of the approaching jet .",
    "such an effect would be expected at much higher velocities than the @xmath75 measured for the individual components . for",
    "the limit of a jet velocity at light speed the above calculations will reduce the lower limit of the jet density by two orders of magnitude and we thus estimate a more conservative @xmath76@xmath9 .",
    "but even such a reduced value is much larger than typical electron - positron or thermal gas plasma densities expected for relativistic jets .",
    "the radio galaxy 3c120 , for example , has densities @xmath77@xmath9@xcite , which is four orders of magnitude lower than our limit for the jet of cena .",
    "the difference can potentially be explained by surrounding material that is evaporated by and entrained into the jet during its outward propagation .",
    "@xcite find indications for the appearance of narrow components in the otherwise broad maser spectrum of ngc1052 .",
    "these components show flux variabilities and line narrowing on timescales of days .",
    "our 2011 atca broadband h@xmath13o  spectra of cena  show indications for similar , transient narrow features . in the jet maser model",
    "such variations could be due to the jet shocking small , high density substructures of the molecular cloud .",
    "the maser properties could be the response to the shock dynamics that includes local density enhancements competing with h@xmath13o  shock dissociation .",
    "the cena  maser line is redshifted to velocities larger than systemic .",
    "the receding , fainter jet may thus be a natural location for the origin of the jet maser feature .",
    "we note , however , that very long baseline array data show that the similarly redshifted h@xmath13o  maser in mrk348 originates from the approaching , brighter jet component of this galaxy .",
    "the full location and geometry of the maser spots in cena  are therefore uncertain until higher resolution imaging will be available .",
    "we report the detection of a 22ghz @xmath15 water maser emission line toward the inner 3pc of the most nearby radio galaxy centaurusa .",
    "the weak and slightly variable maser feature can be classified as a kilomaser and could have its origin in a star formation region , a nuclear disk around the central supermassive black hole , or from material that is shocked close to the jet base of cena .",
    "given the relative smoothness and width of the line , as well as its central location , we conclude that the `` jet maser '' scenario is the most likely one . in this case , the radio jet is shocking a central molecular cloud . from the shock properties , a lower limit to the density of the jet of @xmath78@xmath9  can be derived . a full characterization of the nature and properties of the maser will require higher spatial resolution .",
    "the discovery of a nuclear water maser in cena  opens up further opportunities to probe the extreme environments very close to a smbh .",
    "we thank the australia telescope national facility staff for their assistance , and gratefully acknowledge the allocation of some director s time to confirm this feature .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system and the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",

    "<S> we report the detection of a 22ghz water maser line in the nearest ( @xmath0mpc ) radio galaxy centaurusa using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . </S>",
    "<S> the line is centered at a velocity of @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 , which is redshifted by about @xmath3 km  s@xmath2  from the systemic velocity . </S>",
    "<S> such an offset , as well as the width of @xmath4 km  s@xmath2 , could be consistent with either a nuclear maser arising from an accretion disk of the central supermassive black hole , or for a jet maser that is emitted from the material that is shocked near the base of the jet in centaurusa . </S>",
    "<S> the best spatial resolution of our atca data constrains the origin of the maser feature within @xmath5pc from the supermassive black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the maser exhibits a luminosity of @xmath6l@xmath7 , which classifies it as a kilomaser , and appears to be variable on timescales of months . </S>",
    "<S> a kilomaser can also be emitted by shocked gas in star forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> given the small projected distance from the core , the large offset from systemic velocity , as well as the smoothness of the line feature , we conclude that a jet maser line emitted by shocked gas around the base of the agn is the most likely explanation . </S>",
    "<S> for this scenario we can infer a minimum density of the radio jet of @xmath8@xmath9 , which indicates substantial mass entrainment of surrounding gas into the propagating jet material . </S>"
