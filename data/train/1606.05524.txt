    "the rotating - frame transformation is now performed with respect to all electrons , i.e. , @xmath115 with @xmath116 $ ] and @xmath117 the cartesian momenta of the @xmath114-th electron .",
    "note that the operator @xmath15 without superscript corresponds to the total angular momentum of all electrons whereas the angular momenta of the individual electrons are indicated by @xmath118 .",
    "since all operators corresponding to different electrons commute we can also write this as @xmath119 where the ordering in the product is arbitrary .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath110 can be split now into one - particle ( kinetic energy and electron - nuclei interactions ) and two - particle ( electron - electron interactions ) contributions .",
    "the one - particle contributions transform exactly as discussed in the main text since only the factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : many electron unitary product ] ) corresponding to the specific electron at hand plays a role - this argument also extends to the operators @xmath120 and @xmath121 in the bicircular driving .",
    "furthermore the two - particle contributions are invariant since the rotation induced by the unitary transformation leaves all distances and angles between the electrons invariant . as a consequence",

    "this is completely analogous to the single - electron case .",
    "most notably , we can still define the projected potential in the rotating frame as the sum of the contributions by the individual electrons , @xmath126 which follows the same symmetries as the individual contributions ,",
    "@xmath127 from this point we can follow the same steps presented in the main text for a single electron and arrive at the fourier - expanded hamiltonian in the rotating frame for the many - electron case @xmath128 where the @xmath129 obey the same symmetries as in the main text for all @xmath114 and @xmath130 contains the electron - electron interaction which is of even parity since the potential energy of all electrons is invariant under any spatial transformation . in particular , it does not depend on the molecular symmetry at all . at this point",
    "it becomes clear that all symmetry arguments with respect to the high - harmonic spectra as well as the appearance of main and side lines remain completely intact even in a many - electron description .",

    "<S> we present a complete theory of bicircular high - order - harmonic emission from @xmath0-fold rotationally symmetric molecules . using a rotating frame of reference </S>",

    "<S> our findings reveal that a characteristic fingerprint of rotational molecular symmetries can be universally observed in the ultrafast response of molecules to strong bicircular fields .    </S>",
    "<S> high - order - harmonic generation ( hhg ) represents one of the primary gateways towards obtaining novel table - top light sources with unique properties for a wide range of applications  @xcite . at the same time it holds the promise to revolutionize our understanding of fundamental dynamical processes in atoms and molecules , demonstrated for example by the ultrafast tracing of charge migration in iodoacetylene  @xcite , as well as in condensed - matter systems , exemplified by the advent of extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy in solids  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the generation of bright linearly polarized light through hhg is well - established  @xcite , efforts to expand the toolbox of ultrafast light probes towards circular and elliptical polarization have subsequently attracted great interest , motivated by the vast potential for applications in , e.g. , the study of circular dichroism in chiral molecules  @xcite or the direct measurement of quantum phases  @xcite . the most promising approach , namely hhg of circularly polarized light by bicircular driving , has recently garnered much attention due to several groundbreaking experiments demonstrating tunable polarization through helicity - selective phase matching @xcite , the generation of isolated attosecond pulses @xcite , the extension into the x - ray regime @xcite and even detailed three - dimensional tomography of the emitted high - order - harmonic fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though the generation of circularly polarized pulses via hhg was theoretically examined already in the 1990s @xcite these experimental studies reinvigorated interest also from the theoretical side particularly regarding the question of selection rules @xcite and the role of molecular and orbital symmetries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , a recent article provided a detailed analysis on the correlation between symmetries and high - order - harmonic spectra in both atoms and molecules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the primary focus of most studies has been in the analysis of the simplest bicircular hhg scheme which involves a circularly polarized driver with a fundamental frequency @xmath1 and another driver with opposite circular polarization at @xmath2 . for atomic targets </S>",
    "<S> one observes in this setup harmonics of opposite circularly polarization at frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) whereas no signal is observed for frequencies @xmath6 . for molecular targets </S>",
    "<S> this pattern generally becomes more elaborate @xcite .    in a previous work </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we argued that bicircular hhg can be understood by using a rotating frame of reference . in the case of a spherically symmetric target the neighboring high - order - harmonic peaks in the laboratory frame can be understood to originate from a linearly polarized harmonic in the rotating frame . </S>",
    "<S> this explains , e.g. , the similar emission strength of those two harmonics from @xmath7 states in atomic targets , a fact also reported in @xcite . while the orbital symmetry hence influences the relative strength , the molecular symmetry can completely lead to the appearance and disappearance of certain peaks in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> although the connection between dynamical symmetries and hhg selection rules has been known for a long time @xcite , the imprint of the molecular symmetry for bicircular driving has only recently been discussed @xcite . still , up to this point the focus was mostly on specific driving - field configurations under particular rotational symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> notably , only setups where the driving field consist of frequencies with an integer multiple have been considered . here , we present a model using the rotating - frame picture that makes this restriction unnecessary . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we show that the fingerprint of arbitrary @xmath0-fold rotational molecular symmetries can be found in any bicircular driving scheme with driving pulses of equal strength pointing to the possibility of ultrafast readout of molecular symmetries in , e.g. , chemical reactions .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by briefly reviewing the rotating - frame transformation for a field - free hamiltonian @xmath8 under the influence of the electric field of two counter - rotating circularly polarized pulses with envelope @xmath9 and frequencies @xmath10 polarized in the @xmath11-plane , @xmath12\\,.\\label{eq : bicirc_start}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although we employ a single - active - electron picture it is straightforward to show that the following discussion holds even when multiple electrons are considered , see the appendix for details .    </S>",
    "<S> the unitary transformation @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the operator of angular momentum corresponding to rotation around the @xmath16 axis , leads to the hamiltonian in the rotating frame @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : average_frequency_rotated_ham ] ) demonstrates that in a rotating frame the dynamics of two counter - rotating circularly polarized driving fields can be interpreted as a single linearly polarized driver with double the field strength at the mean frequency with an additional angular momentum term , which we call the coriolis term , proportional to half the difference frequency . in the rotating frame the nuclei are rotating with angular frequency @xmath20 in the @xmath11-plane , indicated by the time dependence of @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the right - circularly polarized ( rcp ) , respectively left - circularly polarized ( lcp ) , signal in the laboratory frame @xmath22 is obtained via the corresponding signal in the rotating frame shifted in frequency by @xmath20 to the left , respectively to the right , i.e. , @xcite @xmath23 these formulas are valid even in the absence of axial symmetry . in a non - axially symmetric </S>",
    "<S> setting , however , the linearly polarized driver in the rotating frame will now irradiate a rotating target . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , we can simplify our discussion even further by focusing on the projection of the molecular potential in @xmath27-direction in the rotating frame , i.e. , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated by the fact that the driving field in the rotating frame is linearly polarized in the @xmath27-direction and the ground - state wave function is centered at the rotational center , i.e. , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , ionization events , which are the first step in hhg according to the three - step model @xcite , are centered around @xmath30 . moreover , we showed in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : expanded rot frame hamiltonian ] ) allows to interpret the time - dependence of the molecular potential in the rotating frame as additional driving fields with frequencies @xmath75 that couple spatially via the coefficient @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> we call these fields `` virtual '' driving fields since they appear due to the transformation to the rotating frame and the resulting rotation of the nuclei therein . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the `` actual '' driving field which is a consequence from the bicircular driving in the laboratory frame . </S>",
    "<S> the virtual driving field has perturbative character since its strength is related to the strength of the coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , when the electron gathers its energy in the continuum , particularly for higher harmonics with corresponding long excursions from the ionic core , the effect of the virtual driving is decreased with distance in contrast to the actual driving whose force on the electron is independent on the distance .    harmonic emission is associated with the dipolar response by the driven system . in all cases @xmath76 is even such that the combined parity of driving by the actual driver and the virtual driver needs to be odd to obtain a dipolar radiation signal , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tab : table1 ] . in a photon picture , for even @xmath0 this is only possible if an odd number of photons is absorbed by the actual driver since the virtual driver is always even so it can not create any `` oddness '' . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the case of no participation of the virtual driver leading to the main line ( @xmath71 ) at @xmath77 for odd @xmath78 as well as all side lines at @xmath79 for odd @xmath78 and arbitrary @xmath80 . for odd @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> there are two possibilities : if an odd number of photons is absorbed from the actual driver then the virtual driver needs to make an even contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this includes no contribution at all , creating the main line @xmath77 , and the leading even order at frequencies @xmath81 , which appears as a secondary side line ( @xmath82 ) at @xmath83 for odd @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the primary side line ( @xmath84 ) can be found at @xmath85 for even @xmath86 since it originates from the combination of an even number of photons absorbed from the actual driver and the leading odd virtual driving at frequency @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> due to the comparatively small impact of the coriolis term the emitted harmonics in the rotating frame are well - approximated as linearly polarized  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : transform ] ) , they contribute roughly equally to the right- and left - circularly polarized signals in the laboratory frame . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the main as well as the first two side lines in the general case are shown at the top of table  [ tab : table2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to discuss a particular example following from these general predictions . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we consider a three - fold molecular symmetry under the driving field configurations @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the lower part of table  [ tab : table2 ] summarizes the expected main and side lines in these two settings according to our model , expressed in terms of multiples of the fundamental driving frequency @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization of particular peaks in the hhg spectrum is determined by the superposition of the contribution from the main and side lines . for @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> all main and side lines with a given circular polarization coincide leading to alternating left- and right - circular polarization ( rcp at @xmath3 and lcp at @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for @xmath89 there exist secondary side line contributions with opposite polarization compared to the main lines at @xmath90 and @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is both a left- and a right - circular contribution on the level of a first side line at @xmath61 and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> in the former case we expect the total signal to be predominantly circularly polarized since the secondary side lines are expected to be much weaker than the main line . for the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the superposition between opposite circular polarization occurs for side lines of the same order , hence we expect that the superposition will be close to linearly polarized . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions are in perfect accordance with the theoretical analysis and numerics shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that in some settings superpositions between , e.g. , main and primary side lines may occur and a precise prediction on the resulting polarization of the total signal would require a more in - depth analysis .    to illustrate our model s high degree of predictability for general bicircular driving schemes we performed numerical simulations of the two - dimensional time - dependent schrdinger equation using a single - active electron approximation on a set of model molecules which obey a discrete @xmath0-fold rotational symmetry in the @xmath11-plane . </S>",
    "<S> they are described by a potential @xmath93^{2}+\\left[y - r\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi p}{n}\\right)\\right]^{2}+a}}\\,,\\ ] ] which represents a set of @xmath0 atomic cores at a distance @xmath94 from the origin evenly distributed at polar angles @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a smoothening parameter @xmath96 for all cores and smear out a total charge @xmath97 homogeneously among them . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations used the following parameter values ( atomic units used throughout ) : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , the driving laser field is given by a trapezoidally shaped bicircular driver with @xmath101 and @xmath102 as well as @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : alpha_scan ] shows hhg spectra in the laboratory frame of rcp and lcp emission for the three - fold , respectively four - fold , cases . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the fingerprint of the corresponding molecular symmetries is well - pronounced and can be observed for all values of @xmath20 . the strong difference between odd and even @xmath0 is clearly revealed with the primary side lines originating at @xmath105 for even multiples of @xmath106 for odd @xmath0 , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> the top panels of fig .  [ fig : alpha_scan ] , whereas for even @xmath0 all main and side lines originate at odd multiples of @xmath106 , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> the bottom panels in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : alpha_scan ] . generally speaking the primary side lines serve as the fundamental fingerprint of the @xmath0-fold rotational symmetry : while the position of the main lines is independent of @xmath0 , the slope of the primary side lines is directly related to @xmath0 , cf .  table  [ tab : table2 ] . while the fingerprint of secondary and higher - order side lines is also characteristic for the underlying rotational symmetry their signal strength is suppressed since these lines originate from high - order contribution from the perturbative virtual driving in our model corresponding to larger values for @xmath33 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : expanded rot frame hamiltonian ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we note that the observation of a clear fingerprint requires that the frequencies corresponding to virtual driving are fourier - resolved by the length of the driving field which necessitates the use of longer driving fields for smaller values of @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally emphasize that our analysis encompasses the cases of continuous symmetry ( i.e.  an axially symmetric target ) and no symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> continuous symmetry is formally equivalent to @xmath107 and we therefore predict only the main line to be present in the hhg @xmath20-scans since the slope of the side lines becomes infinite . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with , the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where an axially symmetric atomic target was considered . in the absence of symmetry we expect that @xmath108 , i.e. , the potential only recurs after a full revolution in the rotating frame .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a model for bicircular hhg in the presence of rotational molecular symmetry that explains all principal characteristics of the observed high - order - harmonic emission . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations show that the resulting spectral fingerprint is well - pronounced and can be used as a reliable indicator of the presence or absence of symmetry for arbitrary driving frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> these findings enable the extraction of constructive tomographic information from high - order - harmonic spectra regarding molecular symmetries and can be employed to track symmetry forming and symmetry breaking on ultrafast timescales .    </S>",
