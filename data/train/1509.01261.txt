    "there has been increasing interest in large - scale clustering measurements of active galactic nucleus ( agns ) in recent years .",
    "such measurements ( see review by @xcite ) not only allow one to study the distribution of matter in the universe out to redshifts where it becomes very challenging and observationally expensive to detect galaxies in large numbers , but they also can be used to constrain theoretical models of agn / galaxy coevolution , feedback mechanisms , agn host - galaxy properties , the distribution of agns with dark matter halo ( dmh ) mass , and the fueling process(es ) of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    spatial correlation measurements with several tens of thousands of galaxies yield significant clustering dependences on galaxy properties such as luminosity , morphological type , spectral type , and redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these findings confirm the hierarchical model of structure formation in which more massive , and hence more luminous , galaxies reside in more massive dmhs and are therefore clustered more strongly ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "whether this relation should also apply to agn luminosity is not trivial .",
    "since the agn luminosity depends primarily on the mass of the smbh ( @xmath2 ) , the accretion rate relative to eddington ( @xmath3 ) , and the radiative accretion efficiency , a relation between clustering and agn luminosity should ultimately be due to a connection between dmh mass and one or more of these physical parameters .    based on smoothed - particle hydrodynamic simulations using gadget ( @xcite ) ,",
    "@xcite explore the correlation between smbh mass and the mass of the hosting dmh . in the simulations ,",
    "the black holes grow either by the accretion of ambient gas or mergers .",
    "the black holes also inject a fixed fraction of the rest mass energy of the gas into the surrounding medium .",
    "a self - regulating black hole injects enough energy to displace gas from the host galaxy on longer timescales .",
    "the binding energy of the gas is determined by the dmh potential .",
    "thus , @xcite conclude that the mass of the smbh is regulated primarily by the dmh mass and not the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite use the semianalytical galaxy - formation model galform ( @xcite ; more details on their simulations are given below in sect .  [ simulations ] ) and find a correlation between smbh mass and dmh mass at almost all cosmic times ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xcite use the measured black hole mass , velocity dispersion @xmath4 , and asymptotic circular velocity of 25 local galaxies from @xcite to show that , although with some scatter , the black hole masses correlate well with the parent dmh masses .",
    "agn clustering studies can be used to observationally test such predictions .",
    "several studies have measured the large - scale clustering dependence on agn on properties such as x - ray luminosity , with varying results .",
    "@xcite find no correlation between the agn x - ray luminosity and the clustering strength at @xmath8 . at @xmath9",
    ", @xcite also detect no significant correlation in their sample of _ xmm - newton_-selected agns .",
    "@xcite reports a tentative ( @xmath101@xmath4 ) dependence of the clustering signal , such that the brighter sample is more clustered than the fainter sample . @xcite and",
    "@xcite verify this finding using different agn samples at different redshifts .",
    "@xcite use a large sample of @xmath101500 agns from the chandra deep field ( cdf ) north and south , the extended cdf south , cosmos , and aegis .",
    "the median redshifts of their low and high @xmath11 agn samples are @xmath12 . except for the cdf south survey , they find weak x - ray luminosity dependences at a level of up to @xmath102@xmath4 .    one way to reduce the uncertainties involved in clustering measurements  beyond using larger agn samples  is to compute the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) with a dense galaxy sample instead of computing the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of the agns .",
    "several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) demonstrate the potential of this approach and compute the ccf between agns and a large sample of galaxies to infer the acf of the agns .",
    "the significant increase in the number of pairs at a given separation , used to measure the clustering strength , reduces the uncertainties in the spatial correlation function compared to the direct measurements of the agn acf .",
    "in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we use the same technique as @xcite to measure the ccf between _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) agns identified in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and a large set of sdss luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) at @xmath0 .",
    "the study is based on sdss data release 4 + ( dr4 + ) .",
    "the unprecedented low uncertainties of the inferred broad - line agn acf allow us to split the sample into low and high x - ray luminosity subsamples and to report a @xmath102.5@xmath4 x - ray luminosity dependence of broad - line agn clustering .",
    "we find that higher luminosity agns cluster more strongly than their lower luminosity counterparts .",
    "consequently , higher luminosity x - ray agns reside , on average , in more massive dmhs than do lower luminosity x - ray agn .    in the second paper of this series (",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) , we describe a novel method of applying the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) modeling technique directly to the precise measured ccf between rass / sdss agns and sdss lrgs to constrain the distribution of agns as a function of dmh mass .",
    "this method also allows us to derive the large - scale bias parameter of the agn sample with much lower systematic uncertainties than using a phenomenological power - law fit , as is often done . as shown in paper ii",
    ", the x - ray luminosity dependence is more prominent in the one - halo term ( @xmath13 @xmath14 mpc ) .",
    "the hod - based typical dmh masses derived from the two - halo term for the high- and low - luminosity rass / sdss agn subsamples differ by @xmath101.8@xmath4 .",
    "in addition , we find that models where the agn fraction among satellites decreases with dmh mass beyond @xmath15 @xmath14 @xmath16 are preferred .",
    "this is in contrast to what is found for satellite galaxies without agns ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the third paper (",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) , we extend the cross - correlation measurements to lower and higher redshifts , covering a redshift range of @xmath17 . we show that the weak x - ray luminosity dependence of broad - line agn clustering is also found if radio - detected agns are excluded .",
    "furthermore , we compute the large - scale clustering for optically selected broad - line sdss agns using the final sdss dr7 , but we detect no optical luminosity dependence on the clustering strength , although the optical broad - line sdss agn sample in @xmath0 contains more than twice as many objects as the rass / sdss agn sample .",
    "we conclude that the most likely explanation for this result is the smaller dynamic range probed in optical luminosities compared to x - ray luminosities .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the redshift range @xmath0 , where the ccf of rass / sdss agns and lrgs has the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "we fit the h@xmath1 line profile in the sdss spectra of broad - line agn to infer the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 .",
    "dividing the agn sample into low and high @xmath2 mass , as well as low and high @xmath3 , provides insights into the main physical driver of the weak detected x - ray luminosity dependence of broad - line agn clustering .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we describe the properties of the lrg tracer set and the agn samples .",
    "section  3 provides details on how we fit the h@xmath1 line profile in the optical sdss agn spectra , derive the @xmath2 , estimate @xmath3 , and define our agn subsamples . in section  4 , we briefly summarize the cross - correlation technique , how the agn acf is inferred from this , and how we derive the large - scale bias parameters using hod modeling .",
    "section  5 provides the results of our clustering measurements .",
    "the detailed results of the hod modeling of the ccfs presented in this paper and in paper iii will be included in a future paper ( t. miyaji et al . in preparation ) .",
    "our results are discussed in section  6 , and we present our conclusions in section  7 . throughout the paper , all distances",
    "are measured in comoving coordinates and given in units of @xmath14mpc , where @xmath18kms@xmath19mpc@xmath19 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we use a cosmology of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , which is consistent with the _ wmap _ data release 7 ( table  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the same cosmology is used in papers i  iii .",
    "luminosities and absolute magnitudes are calculated for @xmath23 .",
    "we use ab magnitudes throughout the paper .",
    "all uncertainties represent 1@xmath4 ( 68.3% ) confidence intervals unless otherwise stated .",
    "the data sets used in this study are drawn from the sdss , which consists of an imaging survey in five bands and an extensive spectroscopic follow - up survey with a fiber spectrograph .",
    "the selection of the optically selected agn candidates is described in @xcite .",
    "lrgs are chosen by following @xcite .",
    "the selection of sdss lrgs follows the procedure described in section  2.1 of paper i and section  2.2 of paper iii .",
    "here we briefly summarize the sample selection .",
    "we extract lrgs from the web - based sdss catalog archive server jobs system using the flag `` galaxy_red , '' which is based on the selection criteria defined in @xcite .",
    "we verify that the extracted objects meet all lrg selection criteria and create a volume - limited sample with @xmath0 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is based on the extinction - corrected @xmath26 magnitude , @xmath27-corrected and passively evolved to rest - frame @xmath28 magnitudes at @xmath29 .",
    "we consider only lrgs that fall into the sdss area with a dr7 spectroscopic completeness ratio of greater than 0.8 and that have a redshift confidence level of greater than 0.95 .",
    "the sdss geometry and completeness ratio are expressed in terms of spherical polygons ( @xcite ) .",
    "the file is publicly available@xmath30 through the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ) website ( @xcite ) .",
    "we correct for the sdss fiber collision as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we have to assign to approximately 2% of all lrgs in our sample a redshift due to the fiber collision problem .",
    "the construction of the random lrg sample is identical to the procedure described in section  3.1 of paper i. our lrg random sample contains 200 times as many objects as the real lrg sample .",
    "we generate a set of random r.a . and decl .",
    "values within dr7 areas with spectroscopic completeness ratios of greater than 0.8 , populate areas with higher completeness ratios more than ones with lower completeness ratios , and randomly assign redshifts to the objects in the sample by using the smoothed redshift profile of the observed redshift distribution .",
    "the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass , @xcite ) is currently still the most sensitive all - sky survey in the soft ( 0.12.4 kev ) x - ray regime . @xcite",
    "positionally cross - correlate rass sources with sdss spectroscopic objects and classify rass- and sdss - detected agns based on sdss dr5 .",
    "they find 6224 agn with broad permitted emission lines in excess of 1000 kms@xmath19 fwhm and 515 narrow permitted emission line agns matching rass sources within 1 arcmin .",
    "more details on the sample selection are given in section  2.2 of paper i and @xcite . since _",
    "rosat _ observed the sky in the soft energy band ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) , the rass / sdss agn sample is biased toward agns with little to no x - ray absorption .",
    "the vast majority of the optical counterparts are therefore agns with broad emission lines and uv excess .",
    "there is no overlap between the rass / sdss agns and the lrg sample .",
    "to study the x - ray luminosity dependence of the clustering of these agns , we have to limit the sdss footprint to the publicly available dr4 + geometry .",
    "we split our sample in the redshift range @xmath0 into subsamples according to x - ray luminosity .",
    "we use a 0.12.4 kev observed luminosity cut ( assuming a photon index @xmath31 , corrected for galactic absorption ) of log @xmath32)=44.29 $ ] .",
    "the observed flux in the 0.12.4 kev band has a large soft - excess contribution that is not representative of the underlying intrinsic , hard power - law x - ray spectrum .",
    "thus , we use the template _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of powerful radio - quiet _ rosat _",
    "qsos from @xcite to estimate the corresponding flux in the 0.510 kev and 210 kev energy ranges . using the median redshift of the sample ( @xmath33 )",
    ", the cut at 0.12.4 kev corresponds to a cut at log @xmath34)=43.7 $ ] and log @xmath35)=43.4 $ ] .    as an alternative estimate",
    ", we match our rass agn sample with the 3xmm - dr5 catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "we fit a regression line between the rass 0.12.4 kev fluxes and the _ xmm - newton _ 212 kev fluxes . using _ xspec _ ( @xcite ) , we model the same ratio with a broken power law and determine the luminosity ratios in the ranges 0.12.4 kev , 0.510 kev , and 210 kev .",
    "we find somewhat smaller corrections : log @xmath32)=44.29 $ ] corresponds to log @xmath34)=43.9 $ ] and log @xmath35)=43.7 $ ] .",
    "this approach has the disadvantage that the observations were taken over a decade apart , and temporal variation in the x - ray luminosity / flux of the objects will affect the estimate .",
    "however , one could argue that such variations are effectively averaged over in a large sample of x - ray objects as used here .",
    "fits to the 0.510 kev _ xmm - newton _",
    "spectra verified that the vast majority ( @xmath1095% ) of the cross - matched rass / xmm agns are unabsorbed in the x - rays ( @xmath36 @xmath37 ) , while the remaining sources show absorption at a level of only a few 10@xmath38 @xmath37 .",
    "we calculate the comoving number densities as described in detail in paper i. for a given r.a . and decl .",
    ", we compute the limiting observable rass count rate and infer the absorption - corrected flux limit versus survey area for rass / sdss agns .",
    "we then compute the comoving volume available to each object ( @xmath39 ) to be included in the sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "the comoving number density follows by computing the sum of the available volume over each object , @xmath40 .",
    "the comoving number densities for the total , high @xmath11 , and low @xmath11 subsamples are 6.0 , 0.12 , and 5.8 @xmath41 @xmath42 mpc@xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the so - called virial method is routinely employed to estimate @xmath44 from single - epoch spectra based solely on the width of broad emission lines together with an appropriate continuum luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fwhm of h@xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and the rest - frame continuum luminosity at 5100  ( @xmath47 ) are most commonly used to compute @xmath44 for low - redshift agns , because the corresponding calibrations are the best - studied ones to date . on the other hand , the h@xmath1 line offers a higher s / n than h@xmath45 and tight relations between @xmath46 and @xmath48 , as well as between @xmath47 and @xmath49 , have been established ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , accurate @xmath44 estimates can also be obtained from the broad h@xmath1 line .    the simultaneous use of the broad h@xmath1 line as a proxy for the velocity dispersion in the broad - line region ( blr ) and for the agn luminosity has two major advantages .",
    "first , we avoid any potential contamination of @xmath47 by host galaxy light and the influence of the broad emission in type i agns on the broad h@xmath45 fwhm measurement ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , we obtain reliable bh mass estimates even for those objects where the s / n of @xmath50 would be too low .      we retrieve the individual sdss dr7 optical spectra for our entire rass / sdss agn sample in order to measure the luminosity and fwhm of h@xmath1 for each agn .",
    "although the fwhm and integrated flux of h@xmath1 could in principle be measured directly from the spectra , the narrow h@xmath1 and [ ] lines on top of the broad h@xmath1 line have a significant impact on the estimated @xmath2 and @xmath3 values ( fig .  [ agn_sdss_spec_fit ] , left panels ) , as highlighted by @xcite .",
    "the narrow h@xmath1 originates from star formation in the host galaxy and the narrow - line region ( nlr ) photoionized by the agn outside of the central .",
    "deblending the broad and narrow emission lines is therefore essential to minimize systematic effects by separating the contribution from the blr and the nlr / host in the h@xmath1 line .",
    "one major complication in modeling the agn spectra is the commonly complex , non - gaussian shape of the broad h@xmath1 line .",
    "previous studies have used multiple gaussian components ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or high - order gauss - hermite polynomials ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to describe the asymmetries of the line .",
    "we test both approaches to fit the sdss spectra and conclude that the latter is more robust against the choice of initial parameter estimates .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    we simultaneously model the broad h@xmath45 and h@xmath1 lines together with the narrow h@xmath45 , [ ] @xmath51 , h@xmath1 , and [ ] @xmath52 emission lines .",
    "we briefly describe our algorithm of modeling the broad h@xmath1 line below and follow an approach similar to @xcite .",
    "the model of the h@xmath45 region ( left panels in fig .",
    "[ agn_sdss_spec_fit ] ) is only used to better constrain the parameters of narrow lines .",
    "the well - isolated narrow [ ] line in the h@xmath45 region gives parameter restrictions that are superior to the narrow - line profiles in the h@xmath1 region , where the narrow and broad lines can be strongly blended .",
    "as a first step , the approximate underlying continua are independently subtracted from the h@xmath45 and h@xmath1 lines by linear interpolation between the adjacent rest - frame spectral regions 47204760   and 50705130  , as well as 61506230   and 67506950  , respectively .",
    "the fit requires initial guesses for the broad and narrow line components .",
    "the initial guesses for the fwhm and line flux of the broad lines are determined by a fourth - order gauss - hermite polynomial of the entire h@xmath1 line and assuming standard h@xmath1 and h@xmath45 ratios .",
    "the initial guesses of the narrow line components are based on the total flux of the observed [ ] line and typical narrow - line agn ratios .",
    "an eighth - order gauss - hermite polynomial provides a good fit for the full model of complex broad h@xmath45 and h@xmath1 line shapes in almost all cases .",
    "all narrow emission lines are assumed to have ordinary gaussian profiles that are coupled in redshift , velocity dispersion , and line ratios for doublets .",
    "while [ ] can exhibit a blueshifted wing in cases with an outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the narrow component usually strongly dominates the line flux , and therefore a single - component line fit is generally robust when coupled to lower ionization lines like [ ] . in cases where the outflow component dominates , we decouple [ ] from the fit to other narrow lines , as described below .",
    "we also add the two dominant lines in the h@xmath45 wavelength range as gaussians to our model .",
    "the best - fit model is determined by using a levenberg ",
    "marquardt minimization algorithm , where spectral regions of unconsidered weak narrow emission lines , e.g. , [ ] @xmath53 and [ ] @xmath54 , have been masked out along with pixels assigned as bad by the sdss spectroscopic pipeline .",
    "we deviate slightly from the scheme above in the following three cases : ( 1 ) the broad h@xmath45 line is too weak to be modeled , ( 2 ) the [ ] line exceeds a width of 600 km sec@xmath19 , or ( 3 ) the narrow h@xmath1 line flux is negative in the initial best - fit model . in the first case , we repeat the model without any broad h@xmath45 and components . in the second and third case ,",
    "the [ ] line is likely to be affected by outflows and may not match the line profile of the other narrow lines .",
    "therefore , we allow the [ ] line to have an independent redshift and velocity dispersion with respect to the other narrow lines .",
    "one percent of the rass / sdss spectra do not allow such an analysis because significant parts of the spectral range around h@xmath1 or [ ] are masked out .",
    "we do not expect any significant impact on our study , due to the low number of objects for which this is the case ( see also sect .",
    "[ robustness ] below ) .",
    "examples of the best - fit models for typical s / n agn spectra are shown in figure  [ agn_sdss_spec_fit ] . from those best - fit models we measure the fwhm and integrated flux of the broad - line h@xmath1 component , as these are the parameters required to estimate @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "our model is not designed to provide a perfect fit to h@xmath1 line profiles for the most complex cases . however , the model deviations concerning the h@xmath1 width and flux are much smaller than the systematics of virial @xmath2 estimates ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "to assess the uncertainties of the derived parameters and to identify unreliable models , we generate 100 realizations of the same spectrum by replacing each pixel within its 1@xmath4 variance given by the sdss error spectrum and analyze the artificial spectra in the same manner . the uncertainty for each quantity",
    "is then taken as the dispersion ( 1@xmath4 error corresponding to 68.3% ) in the best - fit value of all 100 measurements .",
    "we compared our measurements with those of @xcite to cross - check our results with a completely independent algorithm ( fig .",
    "[ ha_comparison ] ) and to provide an estimate of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "in contrast to our study , their sample contains lower luminosity agns at a slightly different redshift range .",
    "thus , the samples only overlap partially . for the broad h@xmath1 fwhm and luminosity",
    ", we find relatively tight correlations around the unity relation .",
    "the measurements of the broad h@xmath1 fwhm exhibit a larger scatter and are slightly skewed toward lower values using our method .",
    "we inspected those spectra and identify a common characteristic in these cases : the narrow lines are broader and weaker than for the other agns in the sample .",
    "thus , deblending the narrow [ nii]+h@xmath1 from the broad h@xmath1 line can be challenging .",
    "this is particularly true for broad h@xmath1 lines with a fwhm less than @xmath55 km s@xmath19 . in summary ,",
    "our line - profile fitting method provides robust estimates for the fwhm and line flux within their systematic uncertainties and without the need for human interaction .",
    "the virial black hole mass is estimated by combining the empirically calibrated blr size - luminosity relation , derived from reverberation mapping monitoring of nearby agns , and assuming virialized blr motions , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the fwhm of broad lines in the agn spectrum and @xmath58 is the virial factor representing the blr kinematics .",
    "several different estimators for @xmath2 have independently been reported in the literature using different blr size - luminosity relations and virial factors based on different assumptions . here",
    "we employ two different calibrations to check their potential impact on our results .",
    "the first is from @xcite : @xmath59 which is also used by @xcite to estimate @xmath2 for all unobscured , optically selected sdss agn .",
    "the second calibration is based on the most recent blr size - luminosity relation of @xcite , assuming a virial factor of @xmath60 , which is empirically determined by @xcite : @xmath61    throughout the paper , we use the second calibration ( @xcite ) for the estimates of the black hole masses . in sect .",
    "[ robustness ] below we test the robustness of our clustering results if the first calibration method is used instead .",
    "as we demonstrate below , we find very similar results using either calibration .    in order to use our measurements from the h@xmath1 line to estimate @xmath44",
    ", we have to replace @xmath47 by @xmath62 and @xmath46 by @xmath48 in equations  ( [ eq : bh_shen ] ) and ( [ eq : bh_bentz ] ) , following @xcite ( their equations  1 and 3 ) .",
    "@xcite point out that the inclusion of low s / n spectra adds a systematic offset in @xmath2 estimates because the line width is systematically underestimated .",
    "therefore , we enforce a lower cutoff in the measured s / n level of the broad h@xmath1 line flux .",
    "we determine the cutoff s /",
    "n by selecting the five agn spectra with the highest s / n .",
    "then , we artificially degrade the s / n gradually down to a continuum s / n of 1 . for each s / n level",
    ", we generate 250 spectra and model these individual spectra with our line - profile fitting method .    at an h@xmath1 fwhm uncertainty level of greater than 40%",
    ", the measurement uncertainties exceed the commonly assumed systematic uncertainties for virial @xmath44 estimates of @xmath100.3 dex .",
    "more than 90% of all of our generated spectra have fwhm uncertainties of less than 40% if we restrict the h@xmath1 s / n to values greater than 10 ( figure  [ ha_sn_sim_results ] ) .",
    "consequently , we adapt this s / n threshold as a limit for selecting objects that yield reliable @xmath44 estimates .",
    "this cutoff leads to a removal of 189 out of 1538 objects ( 12% of the sample ) .",
    "we apply this s / n cut and compare our measured fwhm values to the ones from @xcite .",
    "the observed scatter in fwhm between both methods is 0.08 dex , which corresponds to an @xmath2 error of 0.16 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a simple estimate of the minimum systematic uncertainty in the @xmath44 determination , which is reflected in the commonly assumed total @xmath100.3 dex systematic uncertainty of this method .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the clustering of agn samples with low and high @xmath44 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "any uncertainty in the calibration of @xmath44 will affect our entire sample similarly .",
    "thus , our results will not depend on the absolute accuracy of the @xmath44 calibration because we are interested only in relative @xmath44 values such that we can divide the full sample into low and high @xmath44 subsamples .",
    "the eddington ratio @xmath3 is the ratio between the bolometric and the eddington luminosity ( @xmath63 erg s@xmath19 ) .",
    "the quantity is commonly derived by using the inferred @xmath2 and the optical continuum luminosity at 5100 , adopting a certain bolometric correction factor .",
    "different bolometric correction factors used to estimate the bolometric luminosity @xmath64 from @xmath47 are quoted in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while these correction factors are subject to uncertainties , they are required to estimate the bolometric luminosity if only a single - epoch optical spectrum is available .",
    "we use a correction factor of @xmath65 ( @xcite ) , which is consistent with values used by other studies .",
    "again , we use the relation from @xcite to estimate @xmath47 from @xmath62 for the computation of @xmath64 .",

    "since @xmath2 and @xmath3 are correlated in our full sample , and we aim to reveal which of these quantities drives the observed x - ray luminosity dependence of agn clustering , doing a simple cut of the full sample into low and high @xmath2 subsamples , as well as high and low @xmath3 subsamples , will not be useful .",

    "agn properties such as @xmath2 , @xmath64 , @xmath3 , and redshift are available for each of the different snapshots .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 is calculated assuming that the accretion flow forms a geometrically thin disk for relatively high accretion rates ( @xcite ) . at lower accretion rates , a geometrically thick disk or an advection - dominated accretion flow",
    "is modeled ( adaf , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray luminosities are calculated directly from @xmath64 by applying the bolometric correction from @xcite .",
    "we consider an object to be an agn if its intrinsic 210 kev rest - frame luminosity is @xmath399 erg s@xmath19 .",
    "the sample contains x - ray unabsorbed and absorbed agns .",
    "based on the luminosity , we use the empirical formula of @xcite to determine the probability that the object is absorbed .",
    "we then classify statistically if an object is unabsorbed or absorbed .",
    "below , we will refer to this agn sample as the `` all simulated agn '' sample .",
    "more recent estimates of the obscured fraction of agns as a function of luminosity have been presented by @xcite , who show that the probability that an agn at high luminosities is absorbed is higher than that suggested by @xcite .",
    "we test the impact of a higher obscured fraction at high luminosities and find insignificant differences as far as clustering measurements are concerned .",
    "we therefore retain the empirical obscuration relation of @xcite as presented in @xcite .    since rass is essentially a flux - limited survey",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ app_imag ] , right ) , only agns above a certain x - ray flux are contained in the rass agn catalog .",
    "however , due to the characteristics of the rass , different regions of the sky have different exposure times . to mimic the rass flux selection",
    ", we also apply an average flux cut to the simulated agn sample by using the x - ray luminosities and redshifts of objects in the simulation .",
    "we refer to this sample as the `` rass - selected agn sample . ''",
    "its location in the @xmath2 versus @xmath3 plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ sim_mbh_lledd ] ( colored grid points ) .",
    "this sample also includes the effect that rass is sensitive only to unabsorbed x - ray agns .",
    "however , since the luminosities of the rass agns are high , the simulation classifies the vast majority of the objects as x - ray unabsorbed .    in the same plane",
    ", we also show the observed x - ray - selected broad - line rass / sdss agn sample .",
    "in general , the simulation agrees well with the observations , in that sources lie in a similar region of this space .",
    "however , the simulation slightly overestimates the number of agns with @xmath400 and log @xmath401 .",
    "such objects should be detectable given the rass flux limit , but they do not exist in large numbers ( at the observed redshift range ) .",
    "however , these are the objects in the simulation for which the accretion flow is modeled with an adaf .",
    "these agns are observationally associated with radio - bright , mechanical feedback - dominated smbhs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the optical spectra of these objects do not contain any high excitation lines typical of agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one might argue that these objects would not be classified as agns in an sdss spectrum .",
    "we therefore limit the simulated rass - selected agn sample ( and the predictions in the following paragraphs ) to those sources with log @xmath402 .    despite these minor differences ,",
    "we calculate the bias parameter for the simulated agns and the observed rass - selected agn sample .",
    "the bias is calculated in bins of 0.2 in log @xmath403 and log @xmath404 using eq .  4 given in @xcite ( see also eq .",
    "8 in this paper ) .",
    "we follow the same procedure as for the observed agn samples .",
    "thus , the bias values are converted into typical dmh masses ( log @xmath325 ) .",
    "since the simulation uses the conversion given by @xcite without applying the improved fitting formula by @xcite , we recompute for the observed @xmath11 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 agn subsamples in table  [ xagn_acf ] @xmath325 based only on the ellipsoidal collapse model of @xcite .",
    "this allows us to directly compare the predictions with the observations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] .    in the case of the simulated rass - selected agn sample , we also assign to every bh mass a random error from a gaussian distribution with @xmath405 dex .",
    "we recalculate all of the relations ( red lines ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] for 50 realizations and show a subset of these as orange lines .",
    "this exercise does not only allows for a more realistic comparison to the data , but also allows us to explore the impact of the intrinsic scatter of approximately 0.3 dex in the @xmath2 estimate of the observed sample .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] shows that the 0.3 dex uncertainty in the bh mass estimates has no significant impact on the prediction of the correlations shown . only at very low @xmath2 and high @xmath3",

    "the data and the predictions for the rass sample agree remarkably well .    for the @xmath2 clustering dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] , middle ) , the simulation predicts a strong clustering dependence with @xmath2 for the all simulated agn sample ; a steady increase of typical dmh mass with @xmath2 is found ( see also fig .  7 in @xcite ) . above @xmath407",
    "the correlation is even stronger .",
    "the rass flux limit selection of the all - simulated agn sample has a moderate impact on the @xmath2 clustering dependence .",
    "it amplifies the correlation at @xmath408 and weakens it below @xmath407 compared to an unbiased agn sample .",
    "the model shows that , in flux - limited samples below @xmath407 , no clustering correlation with @xmath2 should be detectable , although an unbiased agn sample will still show a very weak @xmath2 clustering dependence in this @xmath2 range .",
    "this is consistent with the result found by @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath2 clustering dependence agrees reasonably well with the model prediction .",
    "the data hint that the observed clustering dependence might not be as strong as predicted by the simulated rass - selected agn sample .",
    "the predicted @xmath3 clustering dependence also matches the observations well ( fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] , right ) .",
    "below @xmath409 the model predicts higher dmh masses than are currently detected for agns , but our data do not probe eddington ratios that low .",
    "the model predicts that , at low @xmath3 values , the rass flux limit selection should cause a very strong negative @xmath3 dependence to the clustering amplitude . the data point with the lowest @xmath3 in the rass / sdss agn sample",
    "does not allow us to verify or reject this prediction .",
    "although our samples contain objects down to @xmath409 ( see fig .",
    "[ rass_agn_mbh_lledd ] ) , agn samples with even lower @xmath3 are needed to critically test the prediction of high @xmath5 at low @xmath3 .    such tests between observations and state - of - the - art simulations offer a unique opportunity to constrain the physical mechanisms included in galaxy and agn formation models .",
    "for example , a mechanism for the hot - halo mode in which black holes with low @xmath3 and high @xmath2 reproduce the real rass - selected sample might agree better with the observed agn clustering dependences .",
    "thus , a channel has to be found to remove the simulated objects with @xmath410 and log @xmath411 . in the current model ,",
    "the hot - halo agns arise from the necessity for agn feedback in massive dmhs .",
    "the accretion rate in this mode is calculated indirectly from the cooling properties of the host halo and corresponds to an accretion flow that is able to reproduce powerful agn outflows that suppress gas cooling and star formation .",
    "the tuning of the free parameters in this calculation is done by fitting the model to the observed galaxy luminosity function at @xmath395 .",
    "obviously , more observational data are needed to contrain the model .",
    "the comparison between the simulated and real rass - selected agn samples in figs .",
    "[ sim_mbh_lledd ] and [ fig : simulation ] could be used as additional constraints for constraining the free parameters in the model .    when cosmological simulations such as the one presented here are adjusted to match the observed agn clustering properties , to be considered successful they still have to match other observational constraints , such as the luminosity function of galaxies and agns at different redshifts .",
    "changes in the physical treatment of agn accretion might also solve other challenges such as the observed deficiency of low - luminosity agn at high redshifts when compared to predictions from simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . including various constraints from galaxy and agn clustering measurements",
    "has thus the power not only to improve the simulations but also to enhance our general understanding of agn physics and agn and galaxy coevolution .",
    "motivated by the detection of a weak x - ray luminosity dependence of the clustering strength of agns in the first paper of this series , here we explore the physical origin of this dependence . using the optical spectra of our",
    "soft x - ray - selected ( rass / sdss ) luminous , broad - line agn sample at @xmath412 , we estimate black hole masses and eddington ratios and calculate the clustering dependence on each .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath3 are correlated , we create subsamples in @xmath2 and @xmath3 that have matched distributions in the other parameter of interest .",
    "we compute the clustering strength for the subsamples and find a weak clustering dependence with @xmath2 and no significant correlation with @xmath3 .",
    "various adjustments in how the subsamples are created do not change the results .",
    "we also study the clustering of the observed parameters ( luminosity and fwhm of the broad h@xmath1 line ) that are used to derive @xmath2 .",
    "we find a weak fwhm@xmath327 clustering correlation in that agns with low fwhm@xmath327 are less clustered than their high fwhm@xmath327 counterparts .",
    "we also study the clustering properties of an optically selected sdss agn sample .",
    "this sample has 29% of its objects in common with the x - ray - selected rass / sdss agn sample .",
    "we detect the same trends as found for the x - ray agn sample with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath62 , and fwhm@xmath413 . the x - ray and",
    "optically selected agn samples show divergent clustering signals for the lowest @xmath79 ( absolute @xmath82-band magnitude ) samples .",
    "we argue that this is caused by various complex selection effects in the optical sample and that the x - ray - selected rass / sdss agn sample is more uniformly selected .    from our correlation function measurements , we conclude that @xmath2 is the origin of the observed weak x - ray luminosity clustering dependence .",
    "the confidence contours of our agn hod modeling parameters further support this finding , as low and high @xmath2 and @xmath11 samples show extremely similar contours , while the low and high @xmath3 sample contours differ significantly from the @xmath11 contours .",
    "the @xmath2 clustering dependence is detected at a significance level of 2.7@xmath4 . in both the x - ray and optical agn samples ,",
    "the highest clustering strength is found for agns with the 30% highest @xmath2 .",
    "thus , at a redshift range of @xmath0 luminous broad - line agns with more massive @xmath2 reside , on average , in more massive dmhs . in this context",
    ", the dmh mass refers to the single largest ( parent ) halo mass .    since the observed clustering strength does not depend on @xmath3 in a statistically significant way",
    ", agns with high accretion rates do not require large - scale dense environments with high galaxy density .",
    "this provides evidence that major or minor mergers play only a limited role in the agn accretion processes in the low - redshift universe .",
    "internal processes such as disk instabilities could be the dominant agn triggering mechanism at late cosmic times .",
    "empirically motivated models that include simple monotonic relationships between @xmath5 , @xmath383 , and @xmath2 and without agn feedback or treatments of agn triggering do not match well the observed relationships between @xmath2 and @xmath5 derived from clustering .",
    "thus , we use a semianalytical model to study the predicted clustering dependences as a function of @xmath11 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "this model included agn feedback and two modes of agn accretion and fits the observed @xmath2 vs. @xmath5 relation better than the simple model . comparing the simulated full agn sample with a simulated rass flux - limited agn sample ,",
    "we show that observational selection effects moderately change the expected clustering dependences .",
    "the simulation predicts that higher @xmath2 are found in more massive halos , and the predicted correlations with @xmath11 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 agree reasonably well with our observations presented here .    clustering measurements with small uncertainties offer a unique opportunity , after considering the effects of selection biases , to identify missing physics in our current understanding of the galaxy and agn evolution by comparing theoretical predictions with observations .",
