    "dislocations appear to reduce energy of crystals . for large dislocation densities ( which are typically in the range @xmath0 dislocations per square meter )",
    "it makes sense to use the continuum dislocation theory ( cdt ) to predict the distribution of dislocations in equilibrium .",
    "although the framework of cdt has been laid down long time ago by @xcite , the applicability of the theory became feasible only in recent years @xcite thanks to the progress in averaging ensembles of randomly distributed dislocations @xcite . among various alternative strain gradient plasticity theories",
    "we mention here only those of @xcite which , in contrast to cdt , incorporate the history dependent plastic ( or total ) strain gradient rather than employ nye - bilby - krner dislocation density tensor .    in view of the variety of dislocation based gradient plasticity theories",
    "the necessity of having exact solutions of test problems , on which different models can be tested and compared , becomes obvious .",
    "one of the first investigated problem was the torsion of a single crystal bar .",
    "@xcite used strain gradient plasticity theory to compute the torque - twist curve and compared it with the experimental data showing clearly the size effect ( see also @xcite ) . based on an alternative strain gradient plasticity theory , @xcite studied the same problem and found the size sensitivity of both yield stress and hardening rate .",
    "later on , @xcite used cdt with the logarithmic energy of dislocation network proposed in @xcite to find not only the torque - twist curve , but also the distribution of dislocations in a twisted bar ( see the application of cdt to other problems of dislocation pile - ups in a series of our papers @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite computed the energy and distribution of screw dislocations in a free unloaded bar within the linear elasticity and provided the molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and dislocation dynamics simulations @xcite for the twisted bar .",
    "his results confirmed the qualitative agreement with our prediction in @xcite for the twisted bar but displayed at the same time some quantitative differences in the torque - twist curve and the distribution of dislocations in equilibrium .",
    "motivated by the above investigations as well as several existing discrepancies between theories and simulations , this paper studies the torsion of a single crystal bar with a constant circular cross - section using the asymptotically exact cdt proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "our aim is to find the dislocation distribution in equilibrium as function of the given torque and compare with the similar results obtained by numerical simulations in @xcite . to simplify the analysis we assume that the crystal is elastically isotropic and all dislocations are screw . besides",
    ", the side boundary of the bar is traction free and may therefore attract dislocations .",
    "we adopt the free energy formulation found by @xcite that is proved to be asymptotically exact in the continuum limit .",
    "if the dissipation can be neglected , the displacement and the plastic distortion should be found by the energy minimization .",
    "first , we show that the dislocation distribution minimizing energy of the bar with zero torque is uniform .",
    "this agrees well with the result obtained by @xcite .",
    "next , for the bar loaded by a nonzero torque we find an energetic threshold for the dislocation nucleation . if the twist exceeds this threshold , excess dislocations appear to minimize the energy .",
    "it turns out that there is a dislocation - free zone at the outer ring of the bar s cross - section .",
    "the non - uniform distribution of dislocations in equilibrium as well as the twist angle are found in terms of the given torque . in case",
    "the dissipation due to the resistance to dislocation motion is taken into account , the energy minimization should be replaced by a variational equation .",
    "the solution is shown to have an elastic core region in the middle of the cross section .",
    "dislocation are concentrated in a ring between two dislocation - free zones .",
    "this leads to the change of the stress distribution increasing the dissipative threshold of the torque .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the setting of the problem",
    "is outlined and the energy minimizing dislocation distribution in a bar with zero torque is found .",
    "section 3 studies the plastic torsion of the bar at zero dissipation through energy minimization . in section 4 , the plastic torsion of the bar at non - zero resistance to dislocation motion is analyzed .",
    "finally , section 5 concludes the present paper .",
    "consider a single crystal bar of length @xmath1 loaded in torsion by given torques @xmath2 acting at its ends .",
    "let @xmath3 be the cross section of the bar by planes @xmath4 . for simplicity , we consider @xmath3 to be a circle of radius @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the side boundary of the bar @xmath6 $ ] is free from tractions .",
    "the length of the bar is assumed to be much larger than the radius ( @xmath7 ) to neglect the end effects . if the torque @xmath8 is sufficiently small , it is natural to assume that the bar deforms elastically so that the twist is proportional to the torque , provided the bar is initially dislocation - free . if @xmath8 exceeds some critical value , then screw dislocations may appear .",
    "we assume that the active slip planes are perpendicular to the vectors @xmath9 in the cylindrical coordinate system , while the slip directions as well as the dislocation lines are parallel to the @xmath10-axis .",
    "mention that this assumption is not likely to be realistic for single crystals .",
    "however , since the burgers vector is parallel to a screw dislocation , any crystallographic plane containing the dislocation is a possible slip plane .",
    "thus , the screw dislocations in single cubic primitive crystals with the burgers vector parallel to @xmath11 $ ] and slip planes of type @xmath12 , @xmath13 being any irreducible pair of integers , may approximately be regarded as representing this situation .",
    "likewise , the screw dislocations in single hcp - crystals with the burgers vector parallel to @xmath14 $ ] and slip planes of type @xmath15 may also be considered as satisfying this assumption to some degree .",
    "our aim is to determine the distribution of dislocations as function of @xmath8 by the continuum dislocation theory . for screw dislocations with the slip planes perpendicular to the vector @xmath9 ,",
    "the tensor of plastic distortion , @xmath16 , has only one non - zero component @xmath17 .",
    "function @xmath18 can be interpreted as the plastic warping , and , by the symmetry reasoning , we assume that @xmath18 depends only on @xmath19-coordinate : @xmath20 .",
    "the only non - zero components of the plastic strain tensor are given by @xmath21 for the bar of circular cross - section loaded in torsion the only non - zero components of the displacement vector is @xmath22 which depends only on @xmath19 and @xmath10 : @xmath23 .",
    "with the previous equation we obtain for the components of the elastic strain tensor @xmath24 where the comma in indices denotes the partial derivative with respect to the corresponding coordinate .",
    "the only non - zero component of the tensor of dislocation density , @xmath25 , is @xmath26 mention that @xmath27 presents the resultant burgers vector of all dislocations , whose dislocation lines cross an infinitesimal area @xmath28 perpendicular to the @xmath10-axis . thus , the number of screw dislocations per unit area becomes @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the magnitude of burgers vector .",
    "we require the dislocation density to remain finite everywhere including @xmath31 , so function @xmath32 must satisfy the regularity condition @xmath33 hence , the center line of the bar can be considered as an obstacle hindering the motion of dislocations which have to pile up against it .",
    "following @xcite we regard the elastic strain @xmath34 and the dislocation density @xmath35 as the state variables of the continuum dislocation theory .",
    "the free energy per unit volume of the crystal with dislocations is allowed to depend only on the position vector @xmath36 as well as on these state variables . in the continuum limit we lay down @xmath37 the first term of corresponds to the energy contribution due to the elastic strain that includes also the energy of interaction of dislocations , while the second term describes the self - energy of dislocations whose explicit dependence on @xmath38 accounts for the influence of the free boundary @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the free energy density of elastically isotropic crystal bar containing screw dislocations which we present in the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the shear modulus , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being the cut - off radius of the dislocation core .",
    "the first two terms of correspond to the energy contribution due to the elastic strain , the third term is the self - energy of dislocations including dislocation - boundary interaction energy . note that function @xmath43 is well defined only for @xmath19 having a distance larger than @xmath44 to the side boundary @xmath45 .",
    "for @xmath46 we set @xmath47 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this energy density is asymptotic exact in the continuum limit , when the number of dislocations becomes large . according to berdichevsky s classification ,",
    "the first two terms are the main terms , while the last term belongs to the small correction term that is comparable with the error in obtaining the first two terms in the continuum limit for the ensemble of randomly distributed dislocations and should therefore be neglected . however , if we do averaging in the spatial way in which the volume of the bar is divided into a large number of boxes such that the number of dislocations in each box is proportional to the dislocation density times the box volume , the errors in obtaining all three terms through averaging have the same order of smallness that tends to zero as sizes of the boxes go to zero .",
    "thus , the last term in the average energy density , although small compared to the first two due to the smallness of @xmath30 , has the right of existence in the continuum theory obtained by the spatial averaging procedure .",
    "we will see that this small correction term enables one to uniquely determine the distribution of dislocations in terms of the torque .",
    "we assume that the distributed tractions @xmath48 leading to the torques @xmath2 act at the ends @xmath49 of the bar . under the assumption of axial symmetry",
    "the energy functional of twisted bar reads @xmath50 r dr dz - 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{r } t(r)[u_\\theta ( r , l)-u(r,0)]rdr . \\label{2.5}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we consider first the case of free bar with zero traction @xmath51 causing no torque . in this case the true displacement and plastic warping minimize the energy functional @xmath52 r dr dz   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] among all admissible @xmath22 and @xmath18 .",
    "since functional is non - negative , the minimizer vanishes identically : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "there is another interesting question in the case of zero torque , first raised by @xcite and studied later in @xcite : provided @xmath55 screw dislocations exist in the free unloaded bar , how to find the energy minimizing dislocation distribution . within the cdt proposed in this paper",
    ", the problem reduces to finding @xmath22 and @xmath18 that minimize under the constraint @xmath56 this problem can be solved by the variational - asymptotic method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the last term in functional is small , we neglect it in the first approximation .",
    "then the minimizer that makes two first terms vanishing reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 can be interpreted as the twist per unit length due to screw dislocations in the free bar .",
    "this leads to the uniform dislocation distribution @xmath59 . assuming that @xmath60 and substituting @xmath61 into , we obtain @xmath62 if we denote the dimensionless twist per unit length as @xmath63 , then @xmath64 .",
    "this agrees well with the result obtained by @xcite for large @xmath55 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .. ] the minimum of energy is found by substituting into the energy functional .",
    "this yields the energy per unit length @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 the comparison with the dimensionless energy @xmath68 obtained by @xcite is shown in the same figure .",
    "in contrast to the twist , there is a difference in the slope of @xmath68 : in our continuum theory this slope is @xmath69 , while weinberger s numerical simulations gives @xmath70 for large @xmath55 .",
    "since functional is asymptotically exact for large @xmath55 @xcite , weinberger s numerical calculations for @xmath68 must contain some error .        assume now that a non - zero torque @xmath8 is applied .",
    "in this case the true displacement and plastic warping should be found from minimizing functional .",
    "this variational problem can again be solved by the variational - asymptotic method . in the first step we keep in only the first term as the main asymptotic term @xcite .",
    "then the true displacement @xmath22 reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 corresponds to the twist of the bar per unit length .",
    "except the two edges of the bar where @xmath22 and @xmath18 may depend on the detailed distribution of @xmath73 , the energy per unit length in the main part of the bar reduces then to @xmath74 r dr .",
