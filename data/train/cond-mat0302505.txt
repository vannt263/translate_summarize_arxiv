    "recent experimental studies of the mechanical properties of biological materials , ranging from individual dna molecules@xcite to single actin filaments and their networks@xcite , led to revival of interest in the worm - like chain model of semiflexible biopolymers .",
    "in particular , the force - extension curves predicted by this model in the long chain limit ( i.e. , when the length of the chain is much larger than the persistence length ) were shown to agree quantitatively with experimental results on dsdna at large elongations@xcite . however , many interesting questions concerning worm - like chains under tension are still open and there are delicate issues concerning even the linear response of the worm - like chain to stretching force@xcite . also ,",
    "while the equilibrium distribution function of the extension was calculated for the worm - like chain@xcite and fluctuating ribbon@xcite models , only approximate ( using the gaussian approximation ) calculations of the distribution function for stretched chains were reported to datewinkler .",
    "such distributions have been measured in experiments on stretched dna molecules@xcite and provide a much more stringent test of the theory than the force - extension curves .",
    "finally , even though all mechanical experiments involve biopolymers attached to surfaces , none of the present theories incorporates wall effects on force - extension curves and on the corresponding distributions . while such effects are negligible for nearly fully stretched chains , they are expected to be important in the weak force regime .    in previous work@xcite ,",
    "we have discussed how to generate via monte - carlo equilibrium ensembles of fluctuating ribbons with spontaneous curvature and/or twist .",
    "this method was based on using the intrinsic geometry of the filament , in which representation the energy is purely quadratic .",
    "this enables a direct generation of independent samples distributed according to the gibbs equilibrium ensemble . when external forces act on the filaments , the energy is no longer a quadratic function of the curvatures , and the problem is now not only nonlinear but also nonlocal . in this paper",
    "we discuss a biasing method which succeeds in efficiently generating monte - carlo samples for the simplest case of an external force , namely that of the stretched filament .",
    "this problem was studied by marko and siggia , ( ms ) , @xcite and others @xcite who calculated the force - extension curve for long worm - like chains .",
    "we will reproduce these results as well as extend the analysis to the case of nearly stiff filaments with length comparable to or shorter than the persistence length , and in addition calculate the distribution of extensions for various forces .",
    "lastly , we will show how we can also easily incorporate steric constraints ; we will demonstrate this in the context of a restriction of the filament to a half - space by the presence of a wall .    in sections 2 and 3 we review the general theory of fluctuating ribbons ( we define a ribbon as a filament with an asymmetric cross  section ) and the frenet algorithm for computer simulations of such ribbons , respectively . in section 4",
    "we describe the biased monte - carlo simulations of filaments under tension and present the resulting force - extension curves and distribution functions .",
    "wall effects are considered in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we discuss our results and outline directions for future research . in appendix",
    "a we expand the euler angles in terms of the principal curvatures and then use this expansion in appendix b in order to calculate the partition function of a stretched filament . in part 1 of this appendix",
    "we derive an analytic expression for the partition function and obtain a force - extension relation for arbitrary force in the limit of large persistence length ( expansion about the rigid rod limit ) . in part 2 of the appendix we derive asymptotic expressions for the above quantities in the limit of large force ( for arbitrary rigidity ) .",
    "finally , in appendix 3 we present the calculation of the renormalization of the elastic moduli of the various fourier modes of the curvature .",
    "the linear elasticity of ribbons is described by the elastic energyhelixpre @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the distance measured along the contour of the ribbon , the coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the moduli associated with bending along the two principal axes of inertia of the cross section ( they differ if the cross section is not circular ) , and @xmath4 is the twist modulus . in this paper",
    "we treat @xmath5 as given material parameters of the ribbon .",
    "the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the generalized curvatures in the deformed and the stress - free states of the ribbon , respectively .",
    "these curvatures completely determine the three dimensional conformation of the ribbon through the generalized frenet equations@xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the unit tangent to the centerline and the unit vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 are oriented along the principal axes of the cross section ( @xmath12 is the antisymmetric unit tensor ) .",
    "note that since these equations describe a pure rotation of the triad @xmath13 as one moves along the contour of the ribbon , the constraint @xmath14 is automatically satisfied in this intrinsic coordinate description .",
    "the physical frame of the ribbon @xmath13 can be related to the original frenet description of space curves in terms of a unit tangent ( which coincides with @xmath9 ) , normal @xmath15 and binormal @xmath16 , provided that in addition to the frenet triad @xmath17 associated with the centerline of the ribbon , one introduces an angle @xmath18 that describes the rotation of two of the principal axes of the cross section @xmath10 , @xmath11 with respect to the binormal @xmath16 and normal @xmath19 ( see fig . 1 in the second of refs . [ ] ) , @xmath20the three dimensional configuration of the centerline is determined by the frenet equations @xmath21where the curvature @xmath22 and torsion @xmath23 are treated as known functions of position along the contour .",
    "the three generalized curvatures @xmath24 can be expressed in terms of these parameters and the angle @xmath25@xmath26",
    "since the energy is a quadratic form in the deviations @xmath27 of the generalized curvatures from their values in the stress free state , eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is valid as long as the characteristic length scale of the deformation is much larger than the diameter of the ribbon@xcite .",
    "when a ribbon undergoes fluctuations in the presence of a thermal bath at temperature @xmath28 this energy determines the statistical weight of the configuration @xmath29 .",
    "the statistical average of any functional of the configuration @xmath30 is defined as the functional integral@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant . from the form of the energy , eq .",
    "[ energy ] , it follows that the distribution of @xmath27 is gaussian , with zero mean ( @xmath33 ) and second moments given by    @xmath34    in order to study the distribution functions of the various fluctuating quantities ( e.g. , the extension @xmath35 ) , we developed what we entitled the frenet algorithm , which is based on the combination of statistical methods and differential geometry and is described in the following .",
    "examination of eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) shows that the decoupling of the `` noises '' @xmath36 in the intrinsic coordinate representation permits an efficient numerical generation of independent samples drawn from the exact canonical distribution .",
    "the gaussian distribution of the @xmath27 means that each @xmath37 can be directly generated as one of a string of independent random numbers drawn from a distribution symmetric about the origin with width @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the discretization step length .",
    "the remaining task is to construct the curve using the frenet equations with @xmath40 .",
    "the frenet equations are best integrated by stepping the basic triad @xmath41 forward in @xmath1 through a suitable small rotation . in this way",
    ", the orthonormality of the triad is guaranteed to be preserved up to machine accuracy . to construct this rotation matrix , we begin with eqs .",
    "( [ frenet ] ) and , defining the three vectors @xmath42 , and so forth , we can write this equation as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an antisymmetric matrix with elements @xmath45 . we now discretize eq .",
    "( [ aeq ] ) as @xmath46 where the orthogonal matrix @xmath47 is @xmath48 the choice of discretization step length ( @xmath49 is the number of points ) depends on the amplitude of the random noise , @xmath50 we found that @xmath51 points gave sufficient accuracy ( i.e. , was limited by the statistical noise determined by the number of independent samples ) for the calculation of the distribution function of the extension , when the smallest of the moduli satisfied @xmath52    this algorithm is optimal for studying the fluctuations of a free ribbon .",
    "however , if the ribbon is acted upon by external forces and/or constraints , the algorithm must be modified .",
    "this is described in the next section .",
    "consider a filament with a circular cross  section ( @xmath53 ) which is characterized by a bending persistence length@xmath54the simplest example of a filament under tension is that of a constant force acting on one end and directed along the @xmath55-axis , with the second end constrained to lie at the origin but otherwise free to rotate about it .",
    "the energy of the filament thus picks up an additional contribution @xmath56 , where @xmath55 is the projection of the end to end vector on the direction of the force .",
    "the problem is that @xmath55 is a complicated nonlinear function of all the @xmath57 , and so the external force destroys the gaussian structure of the energy on which the generation of the @xmath57 depends .",
    "one can simply incorporate the extra contribution to the energy by treating it as a weighting factor , or bias , and suitably normalizing all averages .",
    "thus , for example , one can calculate the mean value of @xmath55 via @xmath58where the sum is over configurations generated via the frenet algorithm described above and @xmath59 is the force in units of inverse length . for small forces , this works well .",
    "however , as the force increases , the probability of generating highly extended configurations which are heavily favored by the bias , is so small that the sampling becomes ineffective .",
    "one therefore needs a way to bias the generation of configurations towards those that are extended , so they can be sampled appropriately .",
    "this task is not simple , since the connection between the @xmath57 s through which the filament is parameterized and the value of @xmath55 is very complicated .",
    "we can gain insight into this by transforming to fourier space and looking at the expectation value of the moments of the @xmath60th fourier component of the curvature , @xmath61 , using the above algorithm , eq . [ dumb - bias ] , for small to intermediate forces where it is still effective .",
    "for an extensional force , we do not expect spontaneous curvature to develop , and indeed the first moments of the fourier components all vanish .",
    "the second moments , however , do exhibit an interesting structure , as seen in fig .",
    "[ kmoments ] , where the expectation value of the squared amplitude of the low @xmath60 fourier modes are presented for the case @xmath62 , @xmath63 . for @xmath64 , the second moments are independent of @xmath60 , as expected .",
    "when the filament is subjected to a tensile force we see that the small @xmath60 modes are suppressed , with the degree of suppression increasing with @xmath65 and decreasing with @xmath60 . in the case of large @xmath66 , where the fluctuations are in any case small , we observe that only the @xmath67 mode is significantly affected by the force ( not shown ) .",
    "the suppression of the various curvature modes can be calculated analytically when fluctuations are small , namely either in the large @xmath68 limit , or for any @xmath65 provided @xmath69 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the calculation confirms the above - mentioned trends .",
    "we learn from this that the high fourier modes ( or equivalently the small - scale fluctuations ) of the filament are essentially unaffected by the force , whereas the long - wavelength fluctuations are significantly damped .     for different forces @xmath70 , for @xmath71 , @xmath62 .",
    "the lines are added to guide the eye.,width=480 ]    this suggests the possibility of biasing the monte - carlo by selectively dampening the small-@xmath60 modes .",
    "the idea is to generate the @xmath72 s in fourier space , with appropriate amplitudes for the various modes , and construct the real - space @xmath73 via a fast fourier transform .",
    "of course , this bias has to be corrected explicitly in the weighting in the ensemble average .",
    "we do this in a self - consistent fashion , choosing the amplitude of each fourier mode to reproduce the measured square magnitude of the mode . in practice , it is sufficient to do this only for the first few modes , which are the ones most severely impacted by the force . also , in order to reduce the noise in the measurement of the mode amplitudes , we only calculate the averages after every block of @xmath74 realizations and update accordingly , where @xmath75 is the total number of realizations we intend to generate for these parameters . the force dependence of the mode amplitudes is obtained by a stepwise increase of @xmath65 , where for each value of the force we use as a starting point the amplitudes measured at the previous value .",
    "there is one other degree of freedom of the problem that also must be treated appropriately , namely the initial orientation of the filament at its constrained end .",
    "this is because the force not only straightens the filament , but also orients it toward its direction .",
    "we have employed two different algorithms to deal with this problem .",
    "the simpler approach is to simply bias the choice of initial orientation , and correct for this in the weighting .",
    "the zero force distribution of the orientation angle , @xmath76 , of the tangent vector with respect to the direction of the force is @xmath77 . in the presence of the force we modified this to @xmath78 where one can choose @xmath79 to reproduce the measured mean of @xmath80 .",
    "a more sophisticated approach is to explicitly perform the integral over @xmath76 .",
    "we generate a given configuration and calculate its end - to - end distance @xmath35 and angle @xmath81 that the tangent to the end of the filament makes with the direction of the end - to - end vector @xmath82 . in order to evaluate the contribution of this realization to the average elongation , eq .",
    "[ dumb - bias ] , one can perform a rigid rotation of this configuration about the end point and calculate the contribution to the statistical sum , from each angle of rotation @xmath76 .",
    "the resulting integrals over @xmath76 can be expressed in terms of @xmath35 and @xmath81 as @xmath83where the curly braces indicate the integrand for the numerator and denominator of the ensemble sum , respectively .",
    "these integrals can easily be evaluated numerically , using standard techniques .",
    "this second method is more efficient , but more involved to implement .",
    "using these techniques , we have measured the force - extension curve @xmath84 vs. @xmath85 .",
    "we present the results for @xmath86 , @xmath63 in the left box of fig .",
    "[ extenfig ] together with the interpolation formula of ms @xmath87we see that for this value of @xmath66 ( @xmath88 the agreement is very good . in the right half of fig .",
    "[ extenfig ] we present the results for @xmath89 , again with @xmath63 . here",
    "the ms formula does not work for small and intermediate values of the force , since we are not in the long - chain limit ( @xmath90 ) for which it was derived . on the other hand , for this case analysis",
    "can also be done , as presented in the appendix , and the analytic formula derived there is in perfect agreement with the simulations ( see the right box of fig .",
    "[ extenfig ] ) .",
    "notice that the ms expression systematically overestimates the extension of the filament and approaches our results only in the infinite force limit .",
    "the physical basis of the deviation is the large orientational entropy which is not accounted for in the ms calculation .",
    "inspection of the right box of fig .",
    "[ extenfig ] suggests that both the simulation and our analytical approximation ( eq . [ frey ] ) yield a finite initial slope of the extension versus force curve in the rigid rod limit ( @xmath91)@xmath92 since the effective spring constant is proportional to the inverse of the initial slope of this curve this suggests that the linear response of the rigid rod to small stretching forces does not depend on the persistence length @xmath66 and is a function of its length @xmath93 only .",

    "in this work we used biased monte - carlo simulations , based on an extension of our frenet algorithm , to calculate the force - extension relations and the distribution functions of the extension for filaments of arbitrary persistence to contour length ratio .",
    "we showed that in the presence of external force , curvature fluctuations are no longer gaussian and that their long wavelength fourier modes are progressively suppressed by the force .",
    "this effect was taken into account in a self - consistent manner in the simulations by gradually increasing the force and adjusting the corresponding fourier amplitudes of curvature fluctuations .",
    "analytic results were obtained both for small fluctuations about the rigid rod limit , and in the limit of large force . in the former case , we calculated the force - induced renormalization of the length - scale - dependent bending moduli that govern the various fourier modes of curvature .",
    "as expected , the largest effect is on the zeroth ( constant curvature ) mode ; the corresponding modulus increases quadratically and linearly with the force in the weak and strong force limits , respectively .",
    "the underlying physical picture is reminiscent of the suppression of excluded volume by tensile force in the self - avoiding random walk model of polymers - while large scale fluctuations are strongly suppressed , small scale fluctuations ( within the so called pincus blobspincus ) are not affected by the force .    for flexible filaments with @xmath95",
    "our simulation reproduces the marko - siggia force - extension curves .",
    "however , our simulations and analytic results show that as the rigid rod limit @xmath91 is approached , the ms expression increasingly overestimates the response of the filament at finite values of the force , and approaches the correct result only asymptotically , in the limit of infinite force .",
    "the discrepancy can be attributed to the neglect of orientational effects ( the constant curvature mode is not taken into account ) in the ms derivation which is strictly valid only in the @xmath112 @xmath113 limit .",
    "these orientational effects are however seen in the short - chain limit of the gaussian model investigated recently by winklerwinkler .",
    "the large force limit of the gaussian model for short chains is however very different from the worm - like chain model studied herein . for long chains , the gaussian model can reproduce either the weak or the strong force limit , by appropriate choice of the persistence length , but not both",
    "this is an outcome of the length - scale dependence of the effective moduli discussed above and in appendix c.    examination of the distribution functions for the extension shows that increasing rigidity leads to a more rapid shift of the peak of the distribution and narrowing of its width , with external force .",
    "the largest deviations from gaussian statistics of the distributions are observed for stiff filaments in the weak to intermediate force range ( @xmath104 ) , where fluctuations of initial orientation are not yet completely suppressed and where wall effects play an important role .",

    "finally , we would like to comment on possible extensions of the present work .",
    "since we only considered here filaments with symmetric cross section and without spontaneous curvature , twist rigidity did not affect the distribution of extension and played no role in our considerations .",
    "however , since twist rigidity affects even the equilibrium distributions of ribbons with strongly asymmetric cross sections@xcite , it is expected that both twist rigidity and spontaneous twist will affect the deformation of such ribbons as well .",
    "perhaps even more interesting is the effect of spontaneous curvature .",
    "indeed , we have shown that a helical filament with sufficiently large twist to bending rigidity and radius to pitch ratios , undergoes a sequence of stretching instabilities under the action of tensile force , even in the absence of any thermal fluctuations@xcite . in the presence of thermal fluctuations or mechanical noise these instabilities are expected to lead to coexistence between different shapes of the deformed object@xcite .",
