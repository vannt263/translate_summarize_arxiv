    "many population biological models simplify ecological complexity by assuming that habitats are homogeneous . within these models ,",
    "populations have a strong tendency to become evenly distributed in space as time proceeds .",
    "however , many biologically plausible habitats are strongly heterogeneous and provide gradients or localized spots of growth rather than homogeneous growth conditions .",
    "for instance , hydrothermal vents are highly localized environments that may have played a key role in the evolution of life itself @xcite .",
    "today chemo - synthetic bacteria using the heat , methane and sulfur of such vents form the basis of deep sea food chains , ranging from bacteria up to higher organisms as fish or octopuses @xcite ( figure [ fig : realexamples : htv ] ) .",
    "an oasis in the desert is another example , where member species shape the environment for one another , thereby feeding back on the stability of the oasis ( figure [ fig : realexamples : oasis ] ) .",
    "when such heterogeneities are included in the population dynamics , the question arises whether populations will also become heterogeneously distributed , or localized , despite the mixing forces of diffusion or convection .",
    "there have been several theoretical accounts to model the population dynamics at localized growth spots  @xcite .",
    "these studies focused in particular on the effect of a convection term , or wind , on the population localized at a growth spot , called the `` oasis '' .",
    "it has been found found that populations are localized as long as the convection forces remains below a certain _ critical _ value . as the convection speed is increased ,",
    "the population becomes more widely spread around the oasis .",
    "the spread of the population is characterized by a correlation length scale that diverges at the critical convection velocity , signaling a continuous phase transition to extended states .",
    "this delocalization transition has also been investigated experimentally taking advantage of the fast growth rate of microbes  @xcite . in these experiments , bacterial colonies",
    "were grown under hazardous uv light .",
    "only a small localized ( and moving ) plate shielded the colonies , thus creating a preferred growth environment similar to the oasis considered in the theoretical models .",
    "closely related localization phenomena have been studied in evolutionary biology . in this context , populations evolve in a heterogeneous fitness landscape , rather than a geological landscape .",
    "deleterious mutations act like a convection force that tends to push populations away from the optimal ( i.e. most fit ) genotype . for small mutation rates ,",
    "natural selection is able to maintain a population cluster localized at the fitness optimum . for large mutation rates , however , populations drift away from the peak .",
    "the associated delocalization transition is called genetic meltdown in the population genetic literature @xcite , respectively error threshold in the viral quasi - species literature @xcite .    the results on both the ecological delocalization transition and the error threshold ,",
    "have been obtained largely by a linear stability analysis of the localized state .",
    "this approach ignores number fluctuations , which are however inevitable in populations of discrete individuals .",
    "the fluctuations are generated by variations in the offspring number , which itself depend on factors such as environment , lifespan or genetic background .",
    "the question thus arises how the standard view of the localization transition has to be modified to account for number fluctuations .",
    "we hypothesize that localized populations can be destabilized not only by convection but also by number fluctuations .",

    "we first simulate a one - dimensional population localized near a single lattice site with enhanced growth rate .",
    "this oasis is surrounded by a homogeneous habitat of lower growth rate . in order to fix the total population size ,",
    "the excess population produced in each generation is removed by a ( space - independent ) death rate , which is adjusted in each time step .",
    "our main goal is to reveal the impact of number fluctuations on the degree of localization , and the population distribution at steady state .",
    "we augment our simulation results by a mathematical analysis based on branching random walks subject to a tuned global constraint .",
    "this solvable model has been shown to be a good approximation to fixed population size models as far as the description of noisy traveling waves is concerned @xcite .",
    "in our simulations , the population of reproducing individuals is distributed along a linear chain of sub - populations , called demes  @xcite .",
    "these demes are considered to have a distance @xmath2 to their neighbors .",
    "the number of individuals in deme @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "each time step of duration @xmath5 ( typically @xmath6 ) generations consists of the several sub - steps illustrated in figure [ fig : oasismodel ] .",
    "first , we add to each occupancy variable @xmath4 the deterministic change @xmath7 given by @xmath8 the first two terms on the right hand side account for biased migration : individuals jump at rate @xmath9 from @xmath3 to @xmath10 and at rate @xmath11 from @xmath3 to @xmath12 .",
    "the last term represents deterministic growth at the oasis ( @xmath13 ) at rate @xmath14 .",
    "next , we account for a stochastic change by adding @xmath15 given by @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is a random number drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath4 .",
    "the particular form of the noise in ( [ eq : stochastic change ] ) ensures that i ) occupancies do not drop below zero and ii ) the generated variance in occupancy is given by @xmath18 .",
    "the variance produced thus equals the expected variance in a time @xmath5 for a ( large ) population of individuals that duplicate and die at the rate @xmath19 ( in our computational unit of time ) .",
    "we note that the natural alternative of directly simulating individuals that duplicate and die is computational much more expensive if @xmath20 is much larger than @xmath19 .",
    "after the previous sub - steps , the population size will typically be larger than the pre - set value @xmath0 . in order to restore the population size constraint",
    ", we add to each variable @xmath4 the change @xmath21 with a ( global ) death rate @xmath22 the rescaling of the occupancies by the factor of @xmath23 effectively represents a homogeneous culling of the population that is independent of the location .",
    "notice that , although our simulations account for the fluctuations induced by the discreteness of the individuals , the occupancies @xmath4 are generally non - integer .",
    "the approximations involved are equivalent to the diffusion approach widely used in population genetics  @xcite : as long as populations are large ( @xmath24 ) and the temporal changes exhibit the same mean and variance as the discrete particle system , the deviations between both approaches should be small in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "this means in particular that the results become insensitive to the precise noise distribution used , as long as the first two moments are correct .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions , as if demes were arranged on a circle like in the experiments of ref .",
    "the number of demes is chosen large enough to ensure that population fits the simulation box .",
    "time averages are taken after the simulations have become independent of their localized initial conditions .",
    "snapshots of the population density are shown in figure [ fig : snapshots ] .",
    "for the chosen parameter values , fluctuations in the population density are clearly visible .",
    "the time traces of the center - of - mass trajectory ( lower half of figure [ fig : snapshots ] ) indicate that the population peak fluctuates wildly around the oasis , until it eventually escapes .",
    "the escape time ( or delocalization time ) is much greater in the case without convection ( a ) than with convection ( b ) , but it eventually occurs .",
    "in fact , no sharp transition between localized and delocalized populations is detectable in our noisy system .",
    "if the population size is large enough , the delocalization is however unobservable within reasonable ( simulation- ) time . for definiteness",
    ", we say the population is on the oasis , when at least one individual is present there , @xmath26 , and off the oasis , when this condition is not met .",
    "we checked several alternative conditions , they yield similar or comparable results ( see appendix [ apdx : condition ] ) .",
    "time averaged quantities ( i.e. occupancies ) are then obtained by averaging only over states with @xmath26 .",
    "we measured in detail the time - averaged death rate @xmath27 , scaled by its value @xmath28 in the deterministic no - convection limit .",
    "if the overall death rate is large , a population can only be sustained in the vicinity of the oasis where net - growth is positive .",
    "consequently , populations will be strongly localized at the oasis for @xmath29 . for smaller and smaller death rates ,",
    "the population will be able to explore larger and larger parts of the habitat .",
    "when the death rate eventually changes sign ( thus becoming a growth rate ) , growth becomes possible throughout the entire habitat .",
    "as a consequence , the population distribution becomes necessarily extended in space .",
    "therefore , the death rate @xmath30 may be considered as an order parameter that measures the degree of localization of the population at the oasis .",
    "consistent with this interpretation , the mean field theory predicts that @xmath30 continually decays from @xmath19 to @xmath31 as the convection speed is increased from @xmath31 to the critical value @xmath32 .",
    "the death rates @xmath30 obtained from simulations are depicted in figure  [ fig : deathrates ] , across a range of population sizes and convection velocities bounded by @xmath32 for which delocalization is observed in the deterministic limit . as expected from the mean field theory , we find that the death rate continually decays to zero with increasing convection @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , we find that death rates decrease when we decrease the population size .",

    "are shifted to lower values roughly by the constant @xmath38 , as predicted by the analytical approach explained in section [ sec : theoreticalapproach ] . as a consequence ,",
    "smaller convection speeds are required for the death rates to cross @xmath31 , which signals the delocalization of the population .",
    "our time average only includes states in which there is at least one individual at the oasis , @xmath26 . for convection speeds larger or equal than the deterministic critical velocity ,",

    "solid lines are obtained by our theoretical approach explained in section [ sec : theoreticalapproach ] , in particular by the relation ( [ eq : sva - r ] ) . , width=377 ]    another more direct measure for the degree of localization is the escape time @xmath39 between a localization and the consecutive delocalization event , as indicated in the the center - of - mass trajectories in figure [ fig : snapshots ] .",
    "histograms of escape times for various population sizes are shown in figure [ fig : waitingtime : histo ] .",
    "notice that the escape time distribution is to a good approximation exponential , @xmath40 indicating a memory - less delocalization process with a characteristic escape time @xmath41 .",
    "deviations from the exponential distribution are discernible only on short times ( inset in figure [ fig : waitingtime : histo ] )",
    ". these deviations result from fluctuations in the density profile that temporarily satisfy the delocalization condition @xmath42 . after a relaxation process , the occupancy at the oasis is restored .",

    "this quantity @xmath41 is depicted in figure  [ fig : waitingtime : chartime ] as a function of population size for various convection velocities .",
    "notice that @xmath41 decreases when either the population size is decreased ( because the relative strength of fluctuations increases ) , or the convection speed is increased ( because convection removes individuals from the oasis , thereby spreading the population ) .",
    "numerically , our observations can be summarized by ( figure [ fig : waitingtime : chartime ] ) @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in summary ,",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that , due to number fluctuations , populations inevitably escape the `` pinning '' at the oasis on sufficiently long time scales .",
    "the typical escape times , however , increase exponentially with population size , and thus delocalization is effectively unobservable for sufficiently large populations in the absence of convection .",
    "our goal for the following is to develop an analytical framework to predict a critical population size in order to observe localization for a given convection velocity .",
    "this will be used to support the phase diagram in figure [ fig : locstates ] .",
    "while our simulations are discrete in both space and time , they should be amenable to a continuous description if the time step @xmath5 and the reaction rate @xmath14 are small enough . under these assumptions , the stochastic dynamics can be approximated by a reaction - diffusion equation of the form @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is a diffusion coefficient , which has to be set equal to @xmath19 deme@xmath48 per generation to match our simulations .",

    "we have studied localization of a finite population in an ecological context . within our model ,",
    "individuals enjoy an effective growth rate benefit in one site of a linear chain of subpopulations .",
    "we asked the question under which conditions this preferred growth spot , which has been called `` oasis '' , might be able to pin the population .",
    "we found that , under a model of globally regulated total population size , escape from the oasis inevitably occurs due to random number fluctuations .",
    "the escape time however sensitively depends on both the population size and the convection speed .",
    "the delocalization dynamics may be summarized in the phase diagram of figure  [ fig : locstates ] . when the convection speed is small enough and the population large enough , escape",
    "is extremely unlikely and the population can be considered as effectively localized . due to the exponential dependence of escape times on @xmath0 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the cross - over from long to short delocalization times is very sharp in the @xmath0@xmath33 plane .",
    "the measured density profiles converge to the exponential decay for large population sizes , as predicted from deterministic mean field theories @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the deterministic theory generally becomes poorer as escape events become more frequent , either through an increase in convection velocity or through a reduction in population size .",
    "deviations are pronounced in particular in the expected death rate that has to be used to control the population . in the absence of convection , this death rate is found to continually decrease as the population size is lowered .",
    "this is in contrast to the population size independent death rate predicted by the mean - field theory .    to analyze these findings",
    ", we have solved a variant of the model with a tuned population size constraint . in this model , a weighted sum over the occupancies of all demes is held strictly constant .",
    "the weighting function is chosen such that the first moment equation is linear .",
    "this model has the advantage of being analytically tractable .",
    "we found that the tuned model exhibited a sharp delocalization transition for all population sizes .",
    "the phase transition line in the @xmath0@xmath33 plane could be determined in a simple analytical approximation , which is indicated by the dashed red line in the phase diagram figure  [ fig : locstates ] .",
    "interestingly , we found that our tuned model exhibits a continuous delocalization transition driven solely by number fluctuations , even in the absence of convection .",
    "close to the transition , the density profile exhibits a power law tail with exponent @xmath161 up to a correlation length that diverges at the transition .",
    "it has to be remarked that the reason for the sharp phase transition in the tuned model is ultimately due to the inhomogeneity of the weighting function .",
    "occupancy of the oasis is weighted more strongly than occupancy of lattice sites away from the oasis .",
    "this is in contrast to the fixed population size constraint , which has a spatially homogeneous weighting function : the occupancy of all demes are summed up , independent on their identity , and compared with the pre - fixed value .",
    "therefore , the stochastic escape from the oasis is a characteristic effect of this degenerate weighting function .",
    "it remains to be seen , how one could explain analytically the exponential dependence of the typical escape time on population size and convection speed .",
    "nevertheless , our simulations show that the narrow cross - over region from small to large escape times is located close to the sharp phase transition line of our tuned model in figure  [ fig : locstates ] .",
    "furthermore , our tuned model predicts reasonably well the behavior of the death rate required to keep the population size finite .",
    "compared with the mean - field approximation , the death rate is lowered by a value of roughly @xmath38 , in fair agreement with fixed @xmath0 simulations , c.f . figure  [ fig : deathrates ] .",
    "our results also have a natural interpreted in an evolutionary context . consider a population evolving in a fitness landscape characterized by an isolated fitness peak .",
    "mutations cause random movements within this fitness landscape , typically biased in certain directions , and reproduction is often approximated by a branching process subject to the constraint of a fixed population size .",
    "the resulting quasi - species model of a finite population is a higher dimensional version of what we have considered in this paper , but otherwise analogous .",
    "we therefore expect our results could be useful for advancing the quasi - species theory , whose stochastic version has so far remained largely unexplored .",
    "we would like to thank jens nullmeier and paulo pinto for many valuable discussions .",
    "we also acknowledge the anonymous referees for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by the max planck society .",
    "in our simulations , detailed in section [ sec : simulation - model ] , the population always delocalizes from the growth spot if they are run long enough .",
    "our analytically tractable model , on the other hand , describes populations that never fully detach from the oasis , provided the model parameter are within the regime in which the equations of motion , ( [ eq : ustar - eqn ] ,  [ eq : cmean - eqn - orig ] ) , have non - trivial solutions . to compare both approaches",
    ", we needed to average observables only over those configurations in the simulation , which can reasonably be called `` localized '' . in figure [ fig : onoff ] , we present the death rate for several alternative choices for the definition of localized states .",
    "we termed states localized if the center - of - mass ( `` com '' ) of the population was within a certain distance to the oasis and/or if the site of the oasis has an occupancy @xmath180 larger than a certain threshold value .",
    "the tested definitions gave very similar results .",
    "for definiteness , we chose @xmath26 for presenting averaged simulation data in the main text .",
    "note that , with this definition , the death rate averaged over localized states can not entirely decay to zero at the delocalization transition .",
    "this together with the model differences are reasons for the discrepancy between fixed @xmath0 simulations and our analysis of the tuned model , as seen in figures [ fig : deathrates ] , [ fig : nvsrho ] and [ fig : onoff ] .    * different criteria for localization yield qualitatively similar results .",
