    "the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) is the light between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 m accumulated by the global stellar population throughout cosmic time .",
    "it contributes about @xmath7 to the sky brightness from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to infrared ( ir ) wavelength range @xcite with two peaks dominating the spectrum : a first peak between @xmath4 and @xmath8 @xmath6 m , which is due to direct stellar emission ; and a second peak between @xmath8 and @xmath5 @xmath6 m caused by the dust contribution @xcite .",
    "the ebl contains a wealth of information related to the evolution and the structure of the universe and its astrophysical components . measuring the ebl directly , however , is difficult for various reasons .",
    "for example , it is challenging to separate the ebl from the zodiacal light of our solar system and from the foreground light of our galaxy @xcite . for",
    "direct source counts the foreground light causes systematic bias against the detection of individual faint or low surface brightness galaxies and intergalactic stars . despite all difficulties , the measurement of the ebl can provide useful integral constraints on star formation models and the baryonic matter content of the universe @xcite .",
    "several observational studies have been carried out to investigate fluctuations in the ebl .",
    "fluctuations in the ebl are expected due to the density fluctuations of the underlying galaxy population .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite study the anisotropy in the optical regime and @xcite investigate the clustering in the near - ir region using cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) and diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) maps . although one can not determine the ebl density by only knowing the fluctuations in the ebl , the fluctuation measurements can be used to derive limits on the ebl density at certain regions of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "indirect measurements of the ebl can be obtained from observations of the attenuation of @xmath0-ray spectra of distant very high energy ( vhe ) sources such as quasars .",
    "as @xmath0-rays travel through the universe they interact with ebl photons producing electron - positron pairs ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this process leaves a finger print on the spectral index of the quasars in the vhe regime @xcite .",
    "electron - positron pair production is the main channel for @xmath0-ray absorption at vhe , and the only absorption process we consider here for @xmath0-ray photons traveling cosmic distances .",
    "it can take place only if the total energy of the two interacting photons is higher than the rest mass of the electron - positron pair .",
    "based on the cross section of the photon - photon interaction and a model of the ebl density the optical depth ( @xmath10 ) can be computed for vhe @xmath0-ray sources at redshift @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known that galaxies , the sources of the ebl , are clustered .",
    "thus , the ebl density is expected to be subject to fluctuations too .",
    "however , since the ebl is accumulated throughout the history of the universe the fluctuations may be small as they are largely overpowered by the homogeneous contribution of ebl sources at larger distances . to what extent these small fluctuations can impact",
    "the attenuation of vhe quasar spectra is currently still under debate .",
    "recently , @xcite found a correlation between vhe - emitting sources and cosmic voids along the line of sight .",
    "however , they estimate that the attenuation decreases less than @xmath12 for a @xmath0-ray source with opacity @xmath13 if the line of sight goes entirely through under - dense regions .",
    "the model presented here provides a quantitative analysis of ebl fluctuations which allows us to predict the alteration of the attenuation of vhe @xmath0-rays from distant quasars .",
    "the structure of this paper is set as follows . in section  [ sec : mod ] we introduce the analytical ebl model which is based on the work of @xcite and @xcite with an extension allowing for the implementation of ebl fluctuations .",
    "the calculations for the absorption of @xmath0-rays due the interaction with ebl photons are reviewed in section  [ sec : abs ] .",
    "based on deabsorbed quasar spectra the impact of the ebl fluctuations is discussed in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion is given in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    ", is computed following @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the ebl model employed here is similar to the approach presented in @xcite , hereafter referred to as rdf09 , which is a forward evolution model .",
    "rdf09 only takes into account the contribution of the stellar component which is inferred from the stellar thermal surface emission of main - sequence stars modelled as blackbody radiation .",
    "contributions from off - main sequence stars are ignored . since the total contribution of quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) to the optical and the infrared regime of the ebl spectrum is @xmath14 at maximum @xcite",
    "the contributions of agns are ignored by rdf09 and in our model as well .",
    "the ir re - emission of stellar light absorbed by dust is modeled following @xcite , hereafter referred to as frd10 . as an extension",
    "we implement a statistical description of fluctuations of the ebl photon densities due to the clustering of galaxies . for that purpose",
    "we utilise the small scale ( @xmath15 100 mpc ) variance of the cosmic star formation rate .",
    "this section gives a brief review of the rdf09 model , for more details we refer the interested reader to the original article by @xcite .",
    "the rdf09 model estimates the ebl at @xmath16 by integrating the contributions from stars of all masses formed throughout the history of the universe .",
    "the emission of stars is modeled as blackbody radiation at a given temperature emitted from the spherical surface of the star .",
    "temperature and radius are expressed as fitting functions with the stellar mass as free variable .",
    "the mass distribution is modeled by a given initial mass function ( imf ) plus a stellar life time criterion which eliminates the contribution of stars that have left the main sequence .",
    "a further element for the integration of the ebl is the global star formation rate ( sfr ) .    with these ingredients the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the stellar component of the ebl measured at present ( @xmath16 )",
    "can expressed by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the normalization factor for the imf @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the sfr at redshift @xmath11 , @xmath25 is the redshifted energy of the ebl photons , @xmath26 is the redshift when the star evolves away from the main - sequence , and @xmath27 is the total number of emitted photons per time per energy intervals from a star with radius @xmath28 and temperature @xmath29 .",
    "the averaged photon escape fraction from a galaxy , @xmath30 , is given by an empirical fitting function adapted from @xcite .",
    "the fraction of photons generated in stars which does not escape is @xmath31 . in the rdf09 model these photons are considered to be lost . in the frd10 model ,",
    "discussed next section , these photons are re - emitted in the ir band .",
    "rdf09 considers different combinations between the sfr and imf .",
    "we use their best fitting ebl model ( model - b with single power law for the mass - luminosity and mass - temperature relations ) to calculate the sed .",
    "model - b is based on the sfr described in @xcite/[1+(z / c)^d]$ ] with fitting parameters from @xcite : \\{@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35}=\\{0.0166 , 0.1848 , 1.9474 , 2.6316 } ] and the modified ",

    "we will make use of the comoving ebl energy density , @xmath41 , at a given redshift @xmath42 which can be derived from the sed ( eq .  [ eq : r ] ) as follows : @xmath43 note , for the determination of the comoving ebl energy density at @xmath42 all occurrences of `` @xmath44 '' in equation  [ eq : r ] have to be replaces by `` @xmath45 '' .",
    "figure  [ fig : r ] shows the evolution of @xmath41 with redshift .",
    "the dashed lines represent the stellar component and the solid lines show the full ebl with dust re - emission which is discussed in the following section .     and the dashed red line is model by @xcite .",

    "we use the deabsorbed spectrum of les@xmath46 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : slop ] ) which is a nearby high @xmath0-ray energy source .",
    "we then shift this spectrum to various redshifts by `` absorbing '' it , i.e. multiplying it by @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "this is the reverse process to deabsorbing it .",
    "figure  [ fig : cta ] shows the absorbed data points .",
    "purple diamonds , red stars and green circles correspond to redshifts , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively . for comparison",
    "we copy the observed and the deabsorbed data as already displayed in figure  [ fig : slop ] .",
    "the grey line represents the sensitivity limit for @xmath51 observations with cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) .",
    "the third column of table [ tab : mod ] gives the slopes of the absorbed ( observable ) data for the three redshifts .",
    "for @xmath0-ray sources at increasing redshifts the high energy tails of the spectra drop below the detection limit at decreasing energies .",
    "the spectrum of the source shifted to @xmath52 , for instance , drops below the cta sensitivity for @xmath0-ray energies above 700 gev .",
    "it is interesting to note that the slope of the spectrum is very similar to the slope of the sensitivity limit .",
    "thus a slight change in the slope of the observed spectrum , possibly due to fluctuations in the ebl , can have an effect on the detectability of the @xmath0-ray source .",
    "the 4th column of table [ tab : mod ] gives the slopes of the deabsorbed @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "upper and lower limits are based on deabsorption for @xmath0-rays propagating through over- or under - dense regions along the entire path from the source to the observer .",
    "concretely , the absorbed ( i.e. observable ) data points are deabsorbed by multiplying with @xmath53 $ ] , @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the deabsorbed data are fit be power laws .",
    "figure  [ fig : mod ] compares the ranges of the respective slopes to the intrinsic errors of the observation .",
    "the figure indicates that the change in the slope even for the most extreme cases is comparable to the intrinsic error of current measurements .",
    "understanding the evolution of the ebl is crucial for the interpretation of @xmath0-ray observations ( and also for setting constraints on galaxy evolution models ) .",
    "we employ a simple model introduced by @xcite and include dust re - emission following @xcite to describe the evolution of the ebl spectrum . the use of oversimplified stellar evolution models results in spectra that are at the lower bound of current ebl measurements and theoretical predictions .",
    "this does not affect our conclusions since we are interested in _ relative differences _ between ebl in high and low luminosity density environments .",
    "as an extension of current ebl models , we include ebl intensity fluctuations which are assumed to be the result of spatial fluctuations in the sfr .",
    "the statistical description of the spatial fluctuations of the sfr is derived from the semi - analytical galaxy catalogue based on mr7 .",
    "the modified ebl model allows us to investigate the impact of ebl fluctuations on the attenuation of vhe @xmath0-ray spectra due to @xmath1 pair production .",
    "as mentioned above , contributions of agns are ignored . however , despite the relatively small contribution of agns to the overall ebl spectrum the strong clustering of agns at high redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may slightly enhance ebl fluctuations at early times .",
    "testing this conjecture requires the implementation of an agn model which is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "the overall outcome of our study is that , in general , the impact of ebl fluctuations on the slope of vhe @xmath0-ray spectra is negligible . a deabsorption procedure which includes this effect deviates by less than @xmath7 from deabsorption based on mean ebl intensities .",
