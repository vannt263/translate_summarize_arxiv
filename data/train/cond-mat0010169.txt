    "the antiferromagnetic spin heisenberg model has been the object of intense investigation through the years .",
    "recently it has attracted enormous interest in the study of strongly correlated electron systems , which include the oxide superconductors @xcite and low dimensional spin systems . in the limit where the on - site coulomb repulsion is very strong , it is equivalent to the one band hubbard model for half filling .",
    "the inclusion of competing interactions in it has led to novel quantum phases , making it appropriate for the study of quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "the solution of the model was calculated by bethe in one dimension for nearest neighbor interactions @xcite , but a solution in analytic form is lacking for two or three dimensions , except for special cases @xcite .",
    "approximation and numerical techniques that have been used include diagonalization of small clusters @xcite , monte carlo techniques @xcite , cluster expansions @xcite , spin wave expansions @xcite and the density matrix renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the methods that consider the full hilbert space of the problem are limited by the size of the system , since the number of states is exponentially dependent on it . in monte",
    "carlo calculations the sign problem leads to loss of statistical accuracy , especially for frustrated systems @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to these techniques is the direct application of perturbation theory in which corrections to the classical treatment are calculated order by order in the strength of residual interactions , the effect of fluctuations left out in the mean field approximation .",
    "although this approach can also be limited in the size of the systems which can be investigated due to the dimensionality of the hilbert space , it is very different in that it provides analytic information on the effects of corrections to classical approximations and so complements the other approaches mentioned above .",
    "we use this approach to calculate the ground state wavefunction of two systems which have qualitatively different classical ground states , as we will explain below .",
    "we demonstrate that the differences survive in the exact spin @xmath3 ground states through the difference in the analytic structures of the pad approximants derived from the perturbation expansions .",
    "we consider the heisenberg model on closed two dimensional spin @xmath3 systems which have three nearest neighbors .",
    "the antiferromagnetic interaction between the spins leads to frustration at the classical level .",
    "one such system is the 60 site cluster whose relative positions are the same as those of carbon atoms in @xmath4 ( from now on we will refer to n site systems with the spatial symmetry of the fullerenes as @xmath5 ) .",
    "the 60 site system consists of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons . assuming a tight binding model for its electronic properties where there is one orbital per site and a strong coulomb repulsion for double occupancy , the heisenberg model on it gives an effective low energy description at half filling .",
    "this is a first approximation to the problem , since @xmath4 is estimated to be in the intermediate and not in the strong coupling @xmath6 regime @xcite .",
    "the hopping matrix elements between sites on the same pentagon can be taken to be different from the ones between sites on adjacent pentagons .",
    "this leads to two positive exchange constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the hamiltonian is : @xmath9 @xmath7 refers to bonds between the same pentagon and @xmath8 to non - pentagon bonds , while @xmath10 stands for nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the classical ground state of the heisenberg hamiltonian has been determined on this and analogous @xmath5 systems @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of these ground states show an unexpected dependence on @xmath11 . in some",
    "the magnetization is discontinuous in an applied field whereas in others it is the susceptibility which is discontinuous .",
    "it is of interest to determine whether this dependence is an artifact of the classical approximation or whether it is present in @xmath12 solutions .",
    "we use the classical @xmath5 ground states to define an ising hamiltonian where the quantization axis at each site is determined by the direction of the spin vector in the classical ground state .",
    "coherent states are defined along these axes and constitute a mean field approximation for the quantum ground state . in this way",
    ", each site has a local axis associated with it , in contrast to the basis where all spins are defined in the same coordinate system in spin space .",
    "from now on we call the former local basis , and the latter global basis. the quantum fluctuations are then built around the classical directions .",
    "they are the terms added to the original mean field approximation , and they are multiplied with a parameter @xmath1 which varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "when @xmath13 , the full isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian is recovered .",
    "thus the solution is generated as a series expansion in the perturbation parameter @xmath1 with application of perturbation theory , and the expansions of the ground state energy and wavefunction in the local axes basis are known . with this approach",
    "we can study the evolution of the system away from the classical ground state and towards the full quantum limit @xmath13 .",
    "however , the hilbert space for the 60 site system is huge , consisting of @xmath14 states , so a perturbation treatment in the whole hilbert space can only give a few orders .",
    "this is because the number of states involved in the calculation rapidly increases as the order and frustration increase @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the spin axes are directed along the classical solution s directions , the total spin in the global basis is not a good quantum number of the hamiltonian ( when @xmath15 ) , so a reduction of the number of states by focusing on a particular @xmath16 value is not possible .",
    "another way of gaining insight into the problem is to consider similar smaller systems , belonging to the same family . in all these systems",
    "there are @xmath17 number of hexagons and 12 pentagons .",
    "the smallest member of the group is the 20 site system .",
    "again , we consider @xmath12 spins sitting at their vertices .",
    "the frustration of the hamiltonians studied leaves its signature in the various series expansions generated by perturbation theory , producing functions with non - analytic structure in the complex @xmath1 plane .",
    "the presence of branch cuts limits absolute convergence within a circle centered at the origin with a radius of convergence smaller than 1 and the series are only asymptotically convergent in the full isotropic limit where @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we employ analytic continuation with the use of pad approximants .",
    "the structure of the functions in the @xmath1 plane depends strongly on the form of the perturbing hamiltonian .",
    "we investigate the signature of the changes in the complex plane structure of the related functions as the perturbing hamiltonian is varied .",
    "the generalization to complex variables has been proven useful in the study of phase transitions in the two dimensional ising model in temperature @xmath18 in a complex magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the systems studied here are closed and do not possess a thermodynamic limit . however ,",
    "knowledge of the structure in the complex coupling constant plane provides information about the functions studied @xcite .",
    "it can also provide information for the evolution of instabilities . here",
    "the only possible transitions are between @xmath2 sectors with increasing magnetic field , where @xmath2 is the expectation value of the z component of the spin in the global basis .",
    "the classical ground state at zero magnetic field is doubly degenerate , since a flipping of all the spins does not change the energy .",
    "consequently degenerate perturbation theory has to be applied @xcite .",
    "this is done via a similarity transformation , and an effective @xmath19 matrix is generated .",
    "this matrix provides information on the ground and first excited state , including the evolution of @xmath2 as a magnetic field is varied .",
    "the structure of this matrix in the complex @xmath1 plane can be correlated with the transitions of the @xmath2 number between different sectors as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section ii the method for the solution of the problem using perturbation theory is described . in section iii",
    "this is applied to a twelve site system , @xmath20 , where the results are compared with exact diagonalization and found to be in complete agreement .",
    "we also discuss how the analytic structure of perturbation theory is reflected in the magnetic properties . in section",
    "iv perturbation theory is applied to @xmath21 and the results are tested by recovering expectation values for @xmath22 and @xmath23 very close to integer values . here",
    "we contrast the magnetic field dependence of the analytic structure with the results found in the classical approximation . for both @xmath20 and @xmath21 ground and",
    "first excited state wavefunctions are calculated in applied magnetic fields and the dependence of their magnetic properties on the strength of quantum fluctuations is determined . in the case of @xmath21 ,",
    "the ground and excited states at zero magnetic field are singlets .",
    "this result is in agreement with similar ones for strongly frustrated magnetic systems such as the kagom lattice and a one dimensional analogue of the pyrochlore lattice @xcite .",
    "the non - magnetic nature of the excitation is attributed to the frustration and the connectivity of the system .",
    "the starting point in the calculation is the classical ground state .",
    "the hilbert space is spanned by spin @xmath3 spinors determined by the classical solution .",
    "local @xmath24 axes are defined along the classical spin directions , and spin states are defined at each site such that the expectation value of the component of the spin along the axis equals its classical value : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are spinor coefficients and @xmath28 .",
    "the coherent states @xcite are products of spin states along these axes : @xmath29 where n is the number of spins in the system . here",
    "we limit ourselves to these @xmath30 states out of the overcomplete basis of the coherent states .",
    "these are eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath31 and constitute an orthonormal basis .",
    "the classical ground states are the ones where all the spins are either up or down so that @xmath31 has the form of an ising hamiltonian with respect to the local quantization axes defined by the classical result .",
    "the fluctuations around the local @xmath24 axes are raising and lowering spin operators , defined along the local @xmath32 and @xmath33 axes .",
    "these are included in the perturbing part @xmath34 which we scale with a parameter @xmath1 .",
    "each @xmath32 axis is defined in the azimuthal plane of the corresponding @xmath24 axis and perpendicular to it , and then the @xmath33 axis is constructed with the right hand rule . due to the absence of a global z axis , the hamiltonian takes a complicated form .",
    "the solution is generated in perturbation theory as a power series in @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian has the form : @xmath35 where @xmath31 is the classical part and @xmath34 the quantum fluctuations .",
    "there are two well known issues which complicate the application of perturbation theory .",
    "the first is the double degeneracy of the coherent states generated from the classical ground state in the absence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "this requires the use of degenerate perturbation theory . to overcome this problem ,",
    "an effective hamiltonian is constructed for the degenerate ground states , via a similarity transformation @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is transformed to a block diagonal form and its elements , as well as the coefficients of the hilbert space states , which contribute to the perturbed wavefunctions , are expanded as power series in @xmath1 . then recurrence relations can be written down for the effective hamiltonian and the wavefunctions : @xmath36 @xmath37 here k is the order of perturbation , @xmath38 a degenerate ground state of @xmath31 , @xmath39 a state in the hilbert space different from @xmath38 , @xmath40 its energy at the classical level and @xmath41 the classical ground state energy .",
    "l is the dimensionality of the degenerate subspace ( here @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 runs from 1 to l. the result of this calculation is an @xmath44 ( here @xmath45 ) matrix whose eigenenergies are the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "this method can be applied for zero or non - zero magnetic field , where all the magnetic field terms in the hamiltonian are included in the perturbation .",
    "if the magnetic field is included in @xmath31 non - degenerate perturbation theory can be applied in this case .",
    "the second issue complicating the problem is that the perturbative part of the hamiltonian generates series expansions whose radius of convergence does not extend to the isotropic limit @xmath13 but rather is limited to a circle with a radius smaller than 1 .",
    "therefore , we analytically continue outside the radius of convergence with the use of pad approximants . these are described in detail in the literature @xcite .",
    "the algorithms used for their calculation here are the determinant algorithm and the viscovatov algorithm @xcite .",
    "we now apply the method to two systems , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a smaller system with a geometry similar to the ones considered above is the truncated tetrahedron @xmath20 @xcite , shown in figure 1 .",
    "this is made up of four triangles and three hexagons , and looks like a closed triangular lattice .",
    "every site is three fold coordinated , and bonds between sites on the same triangle ( tr . ) are called @xmath7 , while different triangle bonds ( n.tr . )",
    "are named @xmath8 .",
    "the exact solution of the heisenberg hamiltonian has been found for this system and is used to check the results from perturbation theory here . at the classical level it was found to have a jump in the susceptibility at a critical value of an external magnetic field and so has similar properties to the systems discussed in reference @xcite . as mentioned above the classical solution",
    "determines local axes of quantization @xmath24 and determines @xmath31 .",
    "spins belonging to the same triangle are coplanar at the classical level and each local @xmath32 axis is defined in this plane . with application of the right hand rule",
    "the corresponding @xmath33 axis is defined . with @xmath46",
    "the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 ) .",
    "the coefficients reflect the dependence of the hamiltonian on the classical spin directions .",
    "the hamiltonian is complicated , since it includes any possible combination of raising , lowering and @xmath51 operators , and has complex coefficients .",
    "there is no choice of the local coordinate systems that would make all the coefficients real , once the local z axes are fixed along the classical solution s directions .",
    "the local @xmath32 and @xmath33 can also be defined without reference to the specific form of the classical solution , as was stated in section ii , but this results in a more complicated expression for the hamiltonian .      the ground state energy and the wavefunction coefficients are functions of @xmath1 and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 case corresponds to four isolated triangles , while the @xmath54 case corresponds to spins forming singlets ( dimers ) via the @xmath8 bond .",
    "there is no further frustration when assembling the tetrahedron from the individual triangles , since this costs nothing in energy for the classical spins .",
    "consequently for this system the classical ground state is independent of @xmath52 and the quantum fluctuations select a unique ground state when @xmath55 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the order - disorder transition induced by quantum fluctuations for frustrated systems @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the two degenerate ground states has the following form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are polynomials in @xmath1 of nth order , the order of perturbation .",
    "@xmath1 can assume complex values , since we are also interested in the structure of the functions in the complex plane .",
    "the coefficients of series @xmath59 and @xmath60 are complex conjugates of the coefficients of @xmath58 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "therefore , in the case of physical interest where @xmath1 is real , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the complex conjugates of @xmath58 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "diagonalization of the matrix in the latter case shows that its eigenvalues are real , as expected .",
    "the two classical ground states , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , evolve in the following manner as functions of @xmath1 : @xmath63 and similarly for @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are polynomials of nth order in @xmath1 with complex coefficients , @xmath66 is a hilbert space vector different from @xmath61 and @xmath62 and d is the dimensionality of the hilbert space .",
    "l is again the dimensionality of the degenerate subspace ( here @xmath42 ) .",
    "the next step is to analytically continue the polynomials @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath65 .",
    "then the @xmath67 matrix is diagonalized and the energies as well as the wavefunctions are known .",
    "this gives the ground and the first excited state at each value of @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath20 the dimensionality of the hilbert space is @xmath68 .",
    "the ground state energy for different @xmath52 s is given by the converged value of @xmath69 , which is the lowest eigenvalue for the @xmath70th order approximant .",
    "the criterion for convergence is that at order n mean square fluctuations should be @xmath71 of the mean value for the 7 approximants placed around the nth order ( i.e.,@xmath72 ) .",
    "this is easily satisfied for small values of n when @xmath73 for @xmath74 , but the mean square fluctuations increase for larger values of @xmath52 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath70 for different values of @xmath52 can be understood by looking at the structure of @xmath57 in the complex coupling constant plane ( figures 2 and 3 ) which is discussed below .",
    "the analytically continued form for the polynomials is given as the ratio of two polynomials defined in the complex @xmath1 plane so that , for example : @xmath75 where @xmath76 stands for analytically continued .",
    "for @xmath1 on the real axis @xmath77 and @xmath78 guaranteeing real eigenvalues for real @xmath1 .",
    "the structure is revealed by looking at zeros and poles of @xmath79 for complex @xmath1 .",
    "these are the roots of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "frustration leads to branch cuts in the @xmath1 plane which are given by lines of mixed zeros and poles of @xmath79 .",
    "this is how the single valued @xmath79 tries to reproduce a multi - valued function associated with a cut in the complex plane .",
    "this structure is shown for @xmath74 in figure 2 and for @xmath82 in figure 3 , for @xmath83 .",
    "the radius of convergence @xmath84 ( circles ) shrinks as @xmath52 increases and for @xmath85 the perturbation expansion is asymptotically convergent .",
    "this indicates that more orders are needed for pad approximants to converge as the ratio @xmath86 increases .",
    "one explanation for this is that , as @xmath52 increases , the classical ground state is not as good starting point as for small @xmath1 , since the spins tend to form singlets via the @xmath8 bond in the quantum limit .",
    "thus it gets harder to reach the quantum state from the ordered classical ground state , the former made up of independent singlets on the non - triangle bonds at the limit @xmath87 .",
    "as we go to higher orders in perturbation theory the number of calculations goes up , increasing the possibility for significant propagation of numerical error @xcite . to extend the calculation to higher orders ,",
    "the package mpfun was used @xcite , which allows arithmetic to very high precision , limited only by machine specifications .",
    "the perturbation and analytic continuation were done by using typically 94 digits precision in mpfun , except in some cases where 194 digits were used .    to reduce memory requirements and execution time ,",
    "perturbation theory was first run in double precision .",
    "after the states with equal coefficients or coefficients differing only in sign ( in real and/or imaginary part ) due to symmetry were identified , the program was run with mpfun , taking advantage of these symmetries .",
    "thus the scale of the calculation was significantly reduced .",
    "the time required to get 250 orders in perturbation theory was approximately thirty five minutes , when eight processors were used in parallel on a sgi machine . these were ip27 processors with a frequency of 250 mhz .",
    "we typically used 250 orders to get convergence for fields smaller than @xmath7 . a second criterion of convergence comes from the total spin component @xmath2 , which is a good quantum number for the hamiltonian in the isotropic case where @xmath13 . if the analytically continued wavefunction coefficients converge , then the calculation of @xmath2 should yield an integer in an applied field .",
    "any deviation from an integer value indicates lack of convergence , which could be due to insufficient orders of perturbation theory used or propagation of numerical error , and indicates that higher numerical accuracy is needed .",
    "this criterion is more stringent since now all the coefficients @xmath65 have to converge but once convergence is achieved any expectation value can be calculated , since the knowledge of the wavefunction fully solves the problem .",
    "since all the states in the hilbert space determined by the local z axes contribute to the ground and first excited state coefficient functions , the calculated wavefunction is essentially exact .      in the absence of an applied field states with",
    "different @xmath2 values are degenerate and the excited state , a triplet in @xmath20 , is a linear combination of @xmath88 states .",
    "however it is found that starting in the @xmath89 sector as we do the perturbed state stays in this sector for all @xmath1 for both ground and excited state at h=0 .",
    "although this degeneracy is lifted by the applied field , there is an additional degeneracy due to the geometrical symmetries of @xmath20 .",
    "the exact diagonalization shows that there are three degenerate triplet states at the first excitation energy so that even in an applied field the excited state with @xmath90 is triply degenerate .",
    "choosing a particular classical ground state to generate the starting states @xmath61 and @xmath62 picks out a linear combination of these degenerate states .",
    "after the calculation of the ground state wavefunction , its correlation functions can be directly evaluated . in @xmath20",
    "there are five kinds of qualitatively different correlation functions , two of which refer to nearest neighbors . in figures 4 and 5 these",
    "are plotted as a function of the strength of the quantum fluctuations @xmath1 for the case @xmath74 for the ground and excited states respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the correlation function @xmath91 is smaller than @xmath92 and is not plotted .",
    "for @xmath13 the solution of the full isotropic case agrees with the one found from exact diagonalization @xcite .",
    "the nearest neighbor correlation functions are @xmath93 and @xmath94 at the classical level where @xmath95 .",
    "spins 1 and 4 are antiparallel , while @xmath96 is one half of @xmath97 .    in the ground state ( figure 4 ) @xmath96 increases in magnitude with @xmath1 and at @xmath13 equals @xmath98 , being roughly @xmath99 bigger than its classical value .",
    "@xmath97 increases in magnitude as the quantum fluctuations become stronger and reaches its maximum just before @xmath100 .",
    "then it does nt change significantly and its magnitude at @xmath13 is more than two times larger than its classical one , being equal to @xmath101 .",
    "this is because as the perturbation is turned on adjacent spins belonging to different triangles want to create singlet bonds due to their @xmath8 interaction .",
    "the value of @xmath97 at @xmath13 is close to the value for a singlet state between two spins , which is @xmath102 .",
    "the other two correlation functions have a non - trivial dependence on @xmath1 , but their values in the isotropic case do not significantly differ from their classical ones .",
    "the excited state correlation functions of figure 5 do not differ significantly from the ones of figure 4 .",
    "however , we observe a smaller value for @xmath103 compared with the ground state value , while @xmath97 has a smaller magnitude at @xmath13 again compared to the ground state value indicating a more triplet character for this bond .    in figures 6 and 7 we plot the correlation functions for @xmath82 .",
    "we observe that for both the ground and the excited state all the correlations decrease in magnitude , except the ones between neighboring spins connected via the @xmath8 bond .",
    "the value of @xmath97 in the ground state is now @xmath104 , approaching the singlet value @xmath102 even closer .",
    "we next introduce a magnetic field in the problem and study the ground and excited states as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "there are two possible approaches to this calculation .",
    "the first is to perturb around the zero magnetic field classical ground state .",
    "the second is to calculate the classical ground state in the presence of a magnetic field , and then apply perturbation theory .",
    "because the field breaks the time reversal symmetry , the classical ground state is non - degenerate , and in the second case non - degenerate perturbation theory is used .",
    "the results of the two methods should agree at the isotropic limit , @xmath13 .",
    "however , their dependence on @xmath1 is different .",
    "the hamiltonian for the first method has the form : @xmath105 where @xmath31 and @xmath34 were defined before and @xmath106 is the part that relates to the magnetic field .",
    "specifically : @xmath107 h is the strength of the magnetic field in units of @xmath7 and @xmath108 the classical solution s angles with the global z axis .",
    "the direction of the magnetic field is taken along the global z axis , so it is perpendicular to the plane of one of the four triangles of the system .",
    "the spins belonging to any triangle are coplanar in the classical case ( in spin space ) , and they can be chosen to lie in the physical plane of the triangle .      for @xmath13 , the ground state lies in the @xmath89 sector when there is no magnetic field .",
    "@xmath2 is defined along the global z axis , and it commutes with the hamiltonian ( 13 ) at @xmath13 . as the field is turned on the energy of the ground state , which is a singlet , wo nt change at the isotropic limit .",
    "however , the triplet excited state has @xmath90 there , and its energy decreases linearly with the magnetic field due to the zeeman term . at a critical value of the field",
    "the triplet state energy becomes equal to the one of the singlet state , so the triplet state becomes the ground state . as the magnetic field increases further the ground state moves towards spin sectors with higher value of @xmath16 , until the magnetization saturates .",
    "the results for the energies found from perturbation theory and analytic continuation are found in figure 8 , and they reproduce the exact values ( @xmath13 ) . by extrapolation of the straight lines which give the ground and the first excited energy back to zero field , we recover the energies of excited states in the zero field case .",
    "the diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian matrix gives the following eigenenergies : @xmath109 where @xmath79 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the analytically continued values of the corresponding polynomials of @xmath113 order . at the critical fields at which the two states exchange roles as the ground and the first excited state , the square root goes to zero at @xmath13 .",
    "this occurs when @xmath114 and the imaginary part of @xmath115 go to zero .",
    "in this way , we start from two degenerate ground states and we end up with two degenerate states .    the strict criterion for successful convergence of the wavefunctions is the calculation of the @xmath2 number .",
    "this should be an integer at @xmath13 .",
    "we calculate its evolution with @xmath1 in the global spin basis , where the quantization axis is the same for all spins .",
    "the expression for its expectation value @xmath2 is : @xmath116 where g is given by @xmath117 the plus sign corresponds to the ground state and the minus sign to the excited one .",
    "the magnitude of this coefficient is @xmath118 for any real @xmath1 , since in this case @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the accurate calculation of the wavefunctions at the critical fields @xmath119 involves taking the limit @xmath120 . in this case",
    "the magnitude of @xmath110 as well as the imaginary part of @xmath79 go to zero , thus both the numerator and denominator vanish .",
    "the success of the analytic continuation is such that the calculation of @xmath79 and @xmath110 is so accurate after analytic continuation that the result @xmath121 is recovered and this is reflected in the calculated @xmath2 .",
    "the calculation was done for various fields for @xmath74 , and the results are shown in figures 9 and 10 .",
    "there it is shown that indeed @xmath2 assumes integer values when @xmath13 , confirming the success of analytic continuation .",
    "for example , when @xmath122 , at @xmath13 @xmath123 for the ground state and @xmath124 for the excited state .",
    "as seen in figure 9 , the quantum fluctuations raise the value of @xmath2 for small values of the magnetic field , but eventually it goes to zero at the isotropic limit .",
    "however , just above the transition to the @xmath90 sector , which occurs at @xmath125 in agreement with the exact answer , @xmath2 has a non - trivial behavior for intermediate @xmath1 s before assuming the value equal to @xmath118 .",
    "thus for @xmath126 there is a rapid change in the magnetization at a value of @xmath1 close to @xmath118 .",
    "there is competition between the @xmath127 and @xmath118 spin sector for the ground state , and finally the quantum fluctuations lead to the latter .",
    "the magnetic field terms of the perturbing hamiltonian favor a magnetized ground state , while the rest favor zero spin .",
    "the sudden change in @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 moves closer to @xmath13 as @xmath128 from below .",
    "if we go further away from this critical field , the jump is pushed towards smaller values of @xmath1 , and eventually it vanishes .",
    "similar effects are observed in figure 10 , which includes the corresponding graphs for the excited state . in this case , the excited state has @xmath90 below and @xmath89 above the transition .",
    "the conclusion is that there is a window around the critical field where the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath2 is very strong .",
    "as the magnetic field gets bigger , more terms are needed to analytically continue the wavefunction so that the spin number assumes the proper integer values .",
    "there is also a need for greater numerical precision , due to the increased number of calculations which tend to propagate the numerical errors @xcite , and so 194 digits of mpfun accuracy were used .",
    "the transition between the @xmath90 and @xmath129 spin sectors for the ground state takes place at @xmath130 . for a magnetic field equal to 1.01",
    ", 501 orders were generated to get convergence .",
    "this requirement for more orders in perturbation theory and more accuracy makes the calculation of the factor @xmath131 of equation ( 16 ) harder as the second critical field is approached .",
    "the behavior of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 is shown in figure 11 , where the @xmath2 value of the ground state remains constant over a range of @xmath1 , and eventually `` jumps '' to the final value @xmath132 . on the other hand , the excited state @xmath2 approaches 2 close to @xmath133 only to settle at 1",
    "when @xmath13 .",
    "non - monotonic behavior of the quantum number @xmath16 near a transition is observed for other values of @xmath8 as well .",
    "these are shown in figures 12 and 13 , for @xmath8 values equal to @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "for the second case the higher value of @xmath8 stabilizes the spin value for @xmath136 close to @xmath118 .",
    "it was observed that convergence was harder to get as @xmath8 and/or @xmath137 were increased , for the reasons already mentioned .",
    "although the calculated eigenstates at @xmath13 are independent of magnetic field they do depend on the field for intermediate values of @xmath1 .",
    "this can be seen clearly in @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 in figures 9 and 10 .",
    "as pointed out previously the choice of the starting classical ground state picks out a particular linear combination of the three degenerate ( @xmath138 , @xmath90 ) states .",
    "different linear combinations lead to different values of the @xmath139 .",
    "however when adding the values of nearest neighbor @xmath139 for different choices of starting classical ground states the values of the energies , calculated directly in equation ( 15 ) , are recovered .",
    "a further check on the two point correlation functions calculated for the wavefunctions is @xmath140 .",
    "calculating @xmath141 in the ground and excited state at @xmath122 we find @xmath142 and @xmath143 consistent with @xmath144 for @xmath138 and @xmath145",
    ". this measurement tests the accuracy of all two point correlation functions .",
    "the ones for nearest neighbors for @xmath122 are plotted in figures 14 and 15 for the ground and excited states . comparing these with the @xmath1 dependence of the states in figures 6 and 7 ,",
    "the only difference is a non - monotonic dependence at @xmath146 especially for the nearest neighbor correlation functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the motion of the zero of the square root appearing in equations ( 15 ) and ( 17 ) in the complex @xmath1 plane can be traced out with the help of the pad approximants , which are ratios of two polynomials .",
    "since the analytic continuation was quite successful in the vicinity of @xmath13 , we can look for the structure of approximants in this area . to this end , we consider the function @xmath147 which is inside the square root in equations ( 15 ) and ( 17 ) , and we plot the zeros of the numerator and the denominator of the approximants as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the approximants were generated with 220 orders of perturbation theory ( the order of the numerator and the denominator of the pad approximant is one half of this number ) . in figure 16 the complex plane structure",
    "is plotted for a magnetic field h=0.688 .",
    "the pad approximant is seen to reproduce the branch cuts of the function in the complex plane .",
    "there are also zeros and poles in the complex plane not falling on any of the branch cuts .",
    "these are present only in approximants of specific order and they are artifacts of the analytic continuation .",
    "it can be seen how the zeros of equation ( 18 ) appear in the complex @xmath1 plane close to @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion of ( 18 ) are real , so the zeros and the poles appear in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "another feature of the picture is that it is asymmetric with respect to the imaginary @xmath1 axis .",
    "this asymmetry gets more and more pronounced with increasing field .",
    "this is because negative @xmath136 correspond to different ferromagnetic couplings between neighboring sites , and these interactions favor aligned spins , a state similar to the one favored by the magnetic field . in this case",
    "it is more difficult to get convergence because of the competition of the classical antiferromagnetic interactions with the quantum ferromagnetic ones and the magnetic field .",
    "consequently the radius of convergence is smaller .    in figure 17",
    "the roots of the approximants are plotted for various magnetic fields close to @xmath125 in the vicinity of @xmath13 .",
    "the zeros of the square root approach @xmath13 in conjugate pairs and they finally hit the axis at the transition .",
    "as the strength of the field is further increased , the roots move away from @xmath13 in the opposite direction .",
    "we see this behavior in a small range of the fields around the transition with roots around @xmath13 , which is reflected in the rapid non - monotonic variation of @xmath2 around the critical field .",
    "since the square root of function ( 18 ) has to eventually be taken , its zeros will turn into branch points in the complex @xmath1 plane .",
    "the alternative approach to the problem is to calculate the classical ground state in the presence of the magnetic field , and then introduce the remaining terms as perturbation . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath148 where : @xmath149 @xmath150 and @xmath31 and @xmath34 have already been defined in equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) . since the magnetic field breaks the degeneracy of the classical ground state rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory can be applied directly for the wavefunctions .",
    "the results after the analytic continuation are shown in figure 18 .",
    "this method can be compared with the one of the previous section only at @xmath13 , where in both cases the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian is recovered .",
    "starting from the field dependent classical ground state is not any better as far as computer memory and execution time is concerned , since symmetries reduce memory requirements at the same level in both cases .",
    "however , the first method also gives the ground and first excited state very accurately , consequently the approach of the transitions between @xmath16 sectors as a function of the applied magnetic field is easily seen . on the other hand ,",
    "the second method works better for higher fields , since now the classical ground state is related to the strength of the magnetic field , thus it has a non - zero value for @xmath2 .",
    "various fields up to @xmath151 where employed in the calculation .",
    "the results for the energy agree with the exact diagonalization answer @xcite .",
    "looking at figure 18 , we see the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 is not monotonic for the various magnetic fields .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the starting point is now the magnetic field dependent classical ground state .",
    "the terms in the hamiltonian related to the magnetic field tend to increase the spin , while the rest favor a zero spin quantum state , thus there is competition between the two at the classical and quantum level .",
    "in the degenerate case the field dependent terms entered only in the perturbing part of the hamiltonian , making the perturbation stronger and dominant in the determination of @xmath16 for higher @xmath1 s .",
    "the structure of the analytic continuation of the energy was also studied in the non - degenerate case , and it was consistent with the structure found from the degenerate perturbation . for a magnetic field @xmath152 the expression in equation ( 17 ) has a zero at @xmath153 , while the analytically continued function for the energy in the non - degenerate case has a branch cut which starts at a value of @xmath1 equal to @xmath154 and extends almost parallel to the x axis . since @xmath155 , the branch cut of the square root in the degenerate case corresponds to the one of the non - degenerate case demonstrating the consistency of the two approaches starting from the classical ground state in the absence of a magnetic field and the magnetic field dependent classical ground state .",
    "next we consider the 20 site system on the vertices of a dodecahedron , shown in figure 19 . in @xmath21",
    "there is only one kind of bond , which we call j , and each atom has three nearest neighbors as in the @xmath20 case . in the classical solution",
    "spins belonging to the same pentagon are not coplanar @xcite , and the energy per bond is @xmath156 .",
    "this is bigger than the energy per bond for the coplanar spins on an isolated pentagon , which is @xmath157 .",
    "thus when the dodecahedron is assembled from the individual pentagons there is a cost in energy , in contrast to the twelve - site system case .",
    "this system has a discontinuity in @xmath2 as a function of the magnetic field at the classical level unlike the twelve - site system .",
    "the discontinuity has a magnitude of @xmath158 and occurs at a magnetic field @xmath159 .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath4 whereas in @xmath20 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 there is a discontinuity in the slope of the magnetization with applied field @xcite .",
    "we start again from the classical ground states and perturb them with the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the difference now is that the exact solution of the problem is not known and the hilbert space is much larger with @xmath162 states .",
    "the question we wish to address is whether the differences between @xmath20 and @xmath21 seen at the classical level in magnetic properties survive for the @xmath12 case . as we will show below these differences",
    "do survive and are seen in the analytic structure of the perturbation theory for the two systems . since spins are not coplanar at the classical level , the hamiltonian , which is defined as described in section ii , assumes the following complicated form :    @xmath163    @xmath164    @xmath165    where @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 are complex coefficients defined analytically .",
    "for example , for the @xmath170 term @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "since here the starting point is the classical ground state , defining a local z axis at each site , the coefficients of @xmath34 are in general different for different bonds .",
    "furthermore they are complex because of the non - planar character of the spins in the classical ground state .",
    "we apply the same methods towards the solution as in the twelve - site system case .",
    "the elements of the @xmath19 effective hamiltonian matrix @xmath175 in equation ( 10 ) are now real for all applied magnetic fields .",
    "the energies and wavefunctions of the two lowest lying states were calculated up to @xmath176 .",
    "the ground state ( @xmath177 ) and the excited state ( @xmath178 ) are shown in figure 20 . by drawing straight lines through the energies and extrapolating to zero field",
    "the lowest energy state in each spin sector is recovered , as well as the second lowest energy in the @xmath145 sector .",
    "we find these energies to be @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 . the magnetic field dependence is given by a zeeman term @xmath183 .",
    "unlike @xmath20 the first excited state at @xmath184 is a singlet rather than a triplet @xcite .      in figure 21",
    "we plot the lambda dependence of the expectation value @xmath2 for @xmath185 .",
    "we see a behavior similar to the one of @xmath20 , as the ground state assumes the value @xmath186 and the excited state the value @xmath187 at @xmath13 .",
    "again this points to the accuracy of the calculated wavefunctions .",
    "the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic character of the correlation between any two sites remains the same in the ground state and the two lowest lying excited states at @xmath188 . in each of these states the nearest neighbor correlation @xmath189 , while all other @xmath190 have magnitudes @xmath191 at @xmath13 .",
    "correlation functions are plotted for the lowest lying singlet and triplet states at @xmath185 , where they are the ground and first excited state in figures 22 and 23 .",
    "we first consider the nearest neighbor correlations .",
    "for the singlet state , figure 22 , the @xmath192 and @xmath193 are equal only at @xmath95 and @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence for @xmath194 depends on both the starting classical ground state and the value of @xmath137 . for",
    "the lowest energy singlet state , @xmath192 and @xmath193 grow in magnitude from their classical value , @xmath195 at @xmath95 , to @xmath196 at @xmath13 for all nearest neighbor correlations .",
    "thus they are comparable to the value of the nearest neighbor correlation in the ground state of an isolated pentagon , @xmath197 .    in the lowest lying @xmath138 @xmath90 state ,",
    "figure 23 , two values of the nearest neighbor correlation functions are present , @xmath198 and @xmath199 at @xmath13 .",
    "this state can be described by considering the bonds on a pentagon , on its diametrically opposite mirror and on a chain formed by the 10 remaining sites . on these bonds @xmath200",
    "while on the bonds connecting the chain to the two pentagons @xmath201 .",
    "since this configuration can be chosen in six different ways the triplet @xmath138 @xmath90 state is six fold degenerate .",
    "there is little difference between the next nearest neighbors and more distant correlations in the singlet and triplet states .",
    "the quantum fluctuations significantly reduce the magnitude of these correlations compared with their classical values at @xmath95 .    as a further check of the accuracy of the wavefunction the calculated values of these correlations give for @xmath140 the value @xmath202 for the ground state and the value @xmath203 for the excited state at @xmath13 .",
    "these are consistent with the calculated @xmath2 values in figure 21 .",
    "the change in the value of @xmath141 between the singlet and triplet states comes from changes in all the @xmath190 .",
    "the change due to the nearest neighbor @xmath190 s is @xmath204 and the rest comes from small changes , @xmath205 , from the other bonds .",
    "this suggests that there is no simple characterization of the excited states .    in the classical ground state",
    "all the spins in the top and bottom pentagons have the same azimuthal angle @xmath52 with the z axis , which is later taken to be the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the rest of the spins form a different angle @xmath206 with the z axis , so there are two different angles in the classical solution .",
    "there are only two distinct functions @xmath207 of the spins for the calculated states in the magnetic field , and they represent these two kinds of sites in the classical ground state .",
    "they were calculated for @xmath208 and @xmath209 and they are plotted in figure 24 for the ground and the excited state .",
    "they are consistent with @xmath210 calculated in the ground and excited state in figure 21 .",
    "for @xmath184 the excited state is a singlet .",
    "this state has the same symmetry as in the triplet state with two types of nearest neighbor bonds equal to @xmath211 and @xmath196 .",
    "as in the triplet case the longer range correlations , both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic are still comparable in magnitude and @xmath212 .",
    "next we study the structure of the analytic continuation of the off - diagonal element @xmath110 . in figure 25",
    "we plot the structure at a magnetic field equal to 0.3 .",
    "again we observe the asymmetry with respect to the y axis . as in the case of @xmath20 the transition of the ground state between different spin sectors as a function of applied field",
    "can be tracked in the complex @xmath1 plane",
    ". however the trajectory of the zeros of @xmath110 , the off diagonal element in the effective hamiltonian in equation ( 10 ) , is different from @xmath20 where the zeros move from the complex plane onto the real axis at @xmath13 and @xmath213 and then move away for @xmath214 as seen in figure 17 .",
    "these values of @xmath1 are branch points of the energy function for the ground and first excited states . in @xmath21 on the other hand close to the critical field , @xmath215 , two zeros of @xmath216 approach the real @xmath1 axis from above and below at @xmath217 .",
    "the critical field is the value of h were the triplet state first becomes the ground state at @xmath13 .",
    "as @xmath137 is increased further the two zeros move along the real axis in opposite directions , as shown in figure 26 . at these values of @xmath1",
    "there are discontinuous jumps in the value of @xmath2 in the ground state as opposed to the rapid variation with @xmath1 as seen in @xmath20 .",
    "these jumps occur as the ground and excited states with different values of @xmath2 switch roles when @xmath110 changes sign .    in figure 27",
    "we plot @xmath2 for the ground state as a function of applied magnetic field for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the curves for @xmath15 are strongly reminiscent of the results for the magnetization of the classical approximations for @xmath21 and @xmath4 @xcite . for @xmath218",
    "there are discontinuities in @xmath2 for different values of @xmath1 . in these calculations starting from the field independent classical ground state",
    "the magnetic field is part of the perturbation and is scaled by @xmath1 .",
    "so the effective field at which discontinuities in @xmath2 take place is @xmath219 . in the classical approximation for @xmath21",
    "there is a jump in the magnetization as a function of @xmath137 at @xmath220 equal to @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the magnitude of the classical spin . in the ground state calculated here",
    "the jump in @xmath2 occurs for @xmath223 and grows in magnitude until , at @xmath13 , the jump discontinuity in @xmath2 is @xmath118 for @xmath215 .",
    "different magnetic properties for the @xmath12 solutions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are thus seen to come from the different analytic behavior of the wavefunctions in the complex @xmath1 plane .",
    "similarity of the quantum solutions with the classical solutions suggests that this difference in analytic structure comes from the different connectivities of the two systems .",
    "we have applied perturbation theory in the strength of quantum fluctuations around the classical ground states and found essentially exact results for the ground and first excited states for two frustrated spin systems , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for @xmath21 large orders in perturbation expansion and a high degree of numerical precision are required to get convergence of the analytic continuation of the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian and the wavefunction coefficients calculated perturbatively .",
    "we found that although sites in both systems are three - fold coordinated the spectra are qualitatively different with the lowest lying excited state being a triplet in @xmath20 while it is a singlet in @xmath21 .",
    "the difference in the behavior of the two systems is attributed to their difference in the connectivity .",
    "the average energies per nearest neighbor bond for @xmath12 spins , @xmath224 ( in @xmath21 ) and @xmath225 ( in @xmath20 ) , taking @xmath226 , are comparable so that the `` average '' degree of frustration is the same for both systems . in @xmath20 the first excited state",
    "arises by taking a linear combination of states each associated with a triplet excitation of a single non - triangle bond . by comparing @xmath97 in figures 14 and 15",
    "the non - triangle bond is seen to take on a more strongly triplet character in the excited state . in @xmath21 on the other hand there is no nearest neighbor bond which can be singled out to describe the character of the singlet and triplet excited states .",
    "the different values of @xmath22 for states in @xmath21 arise from small changes in long range correlations . in order to distinguish between @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "we observe that in @xmath21 all bonds are members of closed loops in which all bonds are equivalent while in @xmath20 the non - triangle bonds form alternating sides with triangle bonds to make hexagons",
    ". however characterization of connectivity by the nature of bonds forming closed loops is not sufficient in itself since the excited state of the heisenberg model on a cube has a triplet excited state .    in the classical approximation it was possible to characterize the ground state for different systems in terms of a topological number , the skyrmion number , and to associate this with the presence or absence of discontinuities in the magnetization .",
    "we have shown that this difference , seen in the classical approximation for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , survives in @xmath16 for the exact states of the isotropic @xmath12 heisenberg model and that it is associated with the analytic behavior in the complex coupling constant plane .",
    "although it seems clear that it is the combination of frustration and connectivity which is responsible for the nature of the spectrum and the response of the system to a magnetic field , how exactly these are determined is not obvious .",
    "the connection between frustration and the character of the excitation spectrum is also of interest for infinite lattices .",
    "the apparent singlet nature of the excitation spectrum in the kagom lattice arises from frustration @xcite and leads to a large non magnetic contribution to the entropy of the system at low temperatures .",
    "this is an important feature in analysis of experimental data on any physical realization of a kagom lattice .",
    "this result for the kagom lattice may not generalize to other frustrated lattices if the sensitivity to connectivity seen in @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a guide to larger systems @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the wavefunctions found at @xmath13 suggest that the pad approximants derived from the perturbation series are very accurate representations of the wavefunctions and energies in the complex plane between the origin and @xmath13 and that the analytic structure of these functions accurately represents the dependence on @xmath1 and applied field .",
    "we have shown how the rapid change of @xmath2 for @xmath227 and @xmath228 and the discontinuity in @xmath2 for @xmath21 can be traced back to the pad approximants . the ability to track this order - disorder transition from coherent states to eigenstates of @xmath16 and @xmath22 as a function of @xmath1 and applied field",
    "may be developed for richer many body systems with the calculational resources available today .",
    "these calculations are being extended to higher values of spin and to finite temperatures and will be used to investigate the temperature evolution of the properties of magnetic molecules , mn@xmath229 , fe@xmath230 etc . , and , in particular , the quantum mechanical description of the large moments presently used in their analysis @xcite .",
