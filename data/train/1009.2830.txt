    "analysis and derivation of limitations on what is achievable are at the core of many branches of engineering , and thus of tremendous importance .",
    "examples can be found in estimation , information , and control theories . in estimation theory ,",
    "the cramr - rao inequality gives a lower bound on the covariance of the estimation error , in information theory shannon showed that the channel capacity gives an upper limit on the communication rate , and in control theory bode s sensitivity integral bounds achievable control performance .",
    "for an overview of limitations in control and estimation , see the book @xcite .",
    "technology from all of these branches of engineering is used in parallel in modern networked control systems @xcite .",
    "much research effort is currently spent on understanding how the limitations from these fields interact .",
    "in particular , much effort has been spent on merging limitations from control and information theory , see for example @xcite .",
    "this has yielded insight about how future control systems should be designed to maximize their performance and robustness .",
    "derivation of limitations is also at the core of physics .",
    "well - known examples are the laws of thermodynamics in classical physics and the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the exact implications of these physical limitations on the performance of control systems have received little attention , even though all components of a control system , such as actuators , sensors , and computers , are built from physical components which are constrained by physical laws .",
    "control engineers discuss limitations in terms of location of unstable plant poles and zeros , saturation limits of actuators , and more recently channel capacity in feedback loops . but",
    "how does the amount of available energy limit the possible bandwidth of a control system ?",
    "how does the ambient temperature affect the estimation error of an observer ?",
    "how well can you implement a desired ideal behavior using physical components ?",
    "the main goal of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework where questions such as these can be answered , and initially to derive limitations on measurements using basic laws from classical physics .",
    "quantum mechanics is not used in this paper .",
    "the derivation of physical limitations broaden our understanding of control engineering , but these limitations are also potentially useful outside of the traditional control - engineering community . in the physics community , the rigorous error analysis we provide could help in the analysis of far - from - equilibrium systems when time , energy , and degrees of freedom are limited . for micro - electro - mechanical systems ( mems ) , the limitation we derive on measurements can be of significant importance since the physical scale of micro machines is so small . in systems",
    "biology , limits on control performance due to molecular implementation have been studied @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that this paper will be a first step in a unified theoretical foundation for such problems .",
    "the derivation of thermodynamics as a theory of large systems which are microscopically governed by lossless and time - reversible fundamental laws of physics ( classical or quantum mechanics ) has a large literature and tremendous progress for over a century within the field of statistical physics .",
    "see for instance @xcite for physicists account of how dissipation can appear from time - reversible dynamics , and the books @xcite on traditional statistical physics . in non - equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , the focus has traditionally been on dynamical systems close to equilibrium .",
    "a result of major importance is the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _ , which plays an important role in this paper .",
    "the origin of this theorem goes back to nyquist s and johnson s work @xcite on thermal noise in electrical circuits . in its full generality ,",
    "the theorem was first stated in @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the theorem shows that thermal fluctuations of systems close to equilibrium determines how the system dissipates energy when perturbed .",
    "the result can be used in two different ways : by observing the fluctuation of a system you can determine its dynamic response to perturbations ; or by making small perturbations to the system you can determine its noise properties .",
    "the result has found wide - spread use in many areas such as fluid mechanics , but also in the circuit community , see for example @xcite . a recent survey article about the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is @xcite .",
    "obtaining general results for dynamical systems far away from equilibrium ( far - from - equilibrium statistical mechanics ) has proved much more difficult . in recent years ,",
    "the so - called _ fluctuation theorem _ @xcite , has received a great deal of interest .",
    "the fluctuation theorem quantifies the probability that a system far away from equilibrium violates the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "not surprisingly , for longer time intervals , this probability is exceedingly small .",
    "a surprising fact is that the fluctuation theorem implies the fluctuation - dissipation theorem when applied to systems close to equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation theorem is not treated in this paper , but is an interesting topic for future work .    from a control theorist s perspective",
    ", it remains to understand what these results imply in a control - theoretical setting .",
    "one contribution of this paper is to highlight the importance of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in control engineering .",
    "furthermore , additional theory is needed that is both mathematically more rigorous and applies to systems not merely far - from - equilibrium , but maintained there using active control .",
    "more quantitative convergence and error analysis is also needed for systems not asymptotically large , such as arise in biology , microelectronics , and micromechanical systems .",
    "substantial work has already been done in the control community in formulating various results of classical thermodynamics in a more mathematical framework . in @xcite , the second law of thermodynamics",
    "is derived and a control - theoretic heat engine is obtained ( in @xcite these results are generalized ) . in @xcite , a rigorous dynamical systems approach is taken to derive the laws of thermodynamics using the framework of dissipative systems @xcite . in @xcite , it is shown how the entropy flows in kalman - bucy filters , and in @xcite linear - quadratic - gaussian control theory is used to construct heat engines . in @xcite , the problem of how lossless systems can appear dissipative ( compare with @xcite above ) is discussed using various perspectives . in @xcite , how the direction of time affects the difficulty of controlling a process is discussed .",
    "the first contribution of the paper is that we characterize systems that can be approximated using linear or nonlinear lossless systems .",
    "we develop a simple , clear control - theoretic model framework in which the only assumptions on the nature of the physical systems are conservation of energy and causality , and all systems are of finite dimension and act on finite time horizons .",
    "we construct high - order lossless systems that approximate dissipative systems in a systematic manner , and prove that a linear model is dissipative if , and only if , it is arbitrarily well approximated by lossless causal linear systems over an arbitrary long time horizon .",
    "we show how the error between the systems depend on the number of states in the approximation and the length of the time horizon ( theorems  [ prop : errbound ] and [ thm : diss2 ] ) .",
    "since human experience and technology is limited in time , space , and resolution , there are limits to directly distinguishing between a low - order macroscopic dissipative system and a high - order lossless approximation .",
    "this result is important since it shows exactly what macroscopic behaviors we can implement with linear lossless systems , and how many states are needed . in order to approximate an _ active _ system , even a linear one , with a lossless system , we show that the approximation _ must be nonlinear_. note that active components are at the heart of biology and all modern technology , in amplification , digital electronics , signal transduction , etc . in the paper , we construct one class of low - order lossless nonlinear approximations and show how the approximation error depends on the initial available energy ( theorems  [ thm : nonlin_bound ] and [ thm : nonlin_bound2 ] ) . thus in this control - theoretic context , nonlinearity is not a source of complexity , but rather an essential and valuable resource for engineering design .",
    "these result are all of theoretical interest , but should also be of practical interest .",
    "in particular , the results give constructive methods for implementing desired dynamical systems using finite number of lossless components when resources such as time and energy are limited .    as a by - product of this contribution",
    ", the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( propositions  [ prop : fluctdiss ] and [ prop : johnsonnoise ] ) and the onsager reciprocal relations ( theorem  [ thm : timerev ] ) easily follows .",
    "the lossless systems studied here are consistent with classical physics since they conserve energy .",
    "if time reversibility ( see @xcite and also definition  [ def : reversible ] ) of the linear lossless approximation is assumed , the onsager relations follow .",
    "uncertainty in the initial state of linear lossless approximations give a simple explanation for noise that can be observed at a macroscopic level , as quantified by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and the onsager relations are well know and",
    "have been shown in many different settings .",
    "our contribution here is to give alternative explanations that use the language and tools familiar to control theorists .",
    "the second contribution of the paper is that we highlight the importance of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for deriving limitations in control theory . as an application of control - theoretic relevance",
    ", we apply it on models of measurement devices . with idealized measurement devices that are not lossless",
    ", we show that measurements can be done without perturbing the measured system .",
    "we say these measurement devices have no _ back action _ , or alternatively , no _ observer effect_. however , if these ideal measurement devices are implemented using lossless approximations , simple limitations on the back action that depends on the surrounding temperature and available energy emerge . we argue that these lossless measurement devices and the resulting limitations are better models of what we can actually implement physically .",
    "we hope this paper is a step towards building a framework for understanding fundamental limitations in control and estimation that arise due to the physical implementation of measurement devices and , eventually , actuation .",
    "we defer many important and difficult issues here such as how to actually model such devices realistically .",
    "it is also clear that this framework would benefit from a behavioral setting @xcite .",
    "however , for the points we make with this paper , a conventional input - output setting with only regular interconnections is sufficient .",
    "aficionados will easily see the generalizations , the details of which might be an obstacle to readability for others .",
    "perhaps the most glaring unresolved issue is how to best motivate the introduction of stochastics . in conventional statistical mechanics ,",
    "a stochastic framework is taken for granted , whereas we ultimately aim to explain if , where , and why stochastics arise naturally .",
    "we hope to address this in future papers .",
    "the paper @xcite is an early version of this paper .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : micro ] , we derive lossless approximations of various classes of systems .",
    "first we look at memoryless dissipative systems , then at dissipative systems with memory , and finally at active systems . in section  [ sec : fluct ] , we look at the influence of the initial state of the lossless approximations , and derive the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in section  [ sec : hardlimit ] , we apply the results to measurement devices , and obtain limits on their performance .",
    "most notation used in the paper is standard .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the @xmath2-th element .",
    "then @xmath3 denotes the transpose of @xmath4 , and @xmath5 the complex conjugate transpose of @xmath4 .",

    "@xmath11 is the @xmath12-dimensional identity matrix .",
    "in this paper , linear systems in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are anti symmetric ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 is controllable are of special interest . the system ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) is a _ linear lossless system_. we define the _ total energy _ @xmath19 of ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) as @xmath20 _ lossless _",
    "@xcite means that the total energy of ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) satisfies @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the _ work rate _ on the system .",
    "if there is no work done on the system , @xmath23 , then the total energy @xmath24 is constant . if there is work done on the system , @xmath25 , the total energy increases .",
    "the work , however , can be extracted again , @xmath26 , since the energy is conserved and the system is controllable . in fact , all finite - dimensional linear minimal lossless systems with supply rate @xmath27 can be written in the form ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5 ) .",
    "nonlinear lossless systems will also be of interest later in the paper .",
    "they will also satisfy ( [ eq : internalenergy])([eq : powbalance ] ) , but their dynamics are nonlinear .",
    "conservation of energy is a common assumption on microscopic models in statistical mechanics and in physics in general @xcite",
    ". the systems ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) are also time reversible if , and only if , they are also reciprocal , see  ( * ? ? ? * theorem  8) and also definitions  [ def : reciprocal][def : reversible ] in section  [ sec : memory ] .",
    "hence , we argue the systems ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) have desirable `` physical '' properties .    in this paper",
    ", we only consider systems that are lossless and dissipative with respect to the supply rate @xmath27 .",
    "this supply rate is of special importance because of its relation to passivity theory .",
    "indeed , there is a theory for systems with more general supply rates , see for example @xcite , and it is an interesting problem to generalize the results here to more general supply rates .",
    "the system ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) is a linear port - hamiltonian system , see for example @xcite , with no dissipation .",
    "note that the hamiltonian of a linear port - hamiltonian system is identical to the total energy @xmath28 .",
    "there are well - known necessary and sufficient conditions for when a transfer function can be exactly realized using linear lossless systems : all the poles of the transfer function must be simple , located on the imaginary axis , and with positive semidefinite residues , see @xcite . in this paper , we show that linear dissipative systems can be arbitrarily well approximated by linear lossless systems ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) over arbitrarily large time intervals",
    ". indeed , if we believe that energy is conserved , then all macroscopic models should be realizable using lossless systems of possibly large dimension .",

    "circuits with resistors can always be _ approximated _ by systems in the form ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) , as is shown in this paper .",
    "many times macroscopic systems , such as resistors , are modeled by simple static ( or memoryless ) input - output relations @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",

    "hence , ( [ eq : diss ] ) is not lossless .",
    "next , we show how we can approximate ( [ eq : diss ] ) arbitrarily well with a lossless linear system ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) over _ finite _ , but arbitrarily long , time horizons @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "first of all , note that @xmath42 can be decomposed into @xmath46 where @xmath47 is symmetric positive semidefinite , and @xmath48 is anti symmetric .",
    "we can use @xmath49 in the lossless approximation ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) and need only to consider the symmetric matrix @xmath47 next .",

    "thus since @xmath36 is smooth , we can also model @xmath50 using only the causal part @xmath70 if it is scaled by a factor of two .",
    "this leads to a linear lossless approximation of @xmath50 that we denote by the linear operator @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 here @xmath73 denotes the space of twice continuously differentiable functions on the interval @xmath45 $ ] .",

    "hence , we have the bound @xmath85 since @xmath86 , we can establish the bound in the theorem .",
    "the theorem shows that by choosing the truncation order @xmath87 sufficiently large , the memoryless model ( [ eq : diss ] ) can be approximated as well as we like with a lossless linear system , if inputs are smooth .",

    "on physical grounds one may prefer the model @xmath90 even though it is more complex , since it assumes the form ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) of a lossless system ( and is time reversible if @xmath42 is reciprocal , see theorem  [ thm : timerev ] ) .",
    "additional support for this idea is given in section  [ sec : fluct ] .",
    "note that the lossless approximation @xmath74 is far from unique : the time interval @xmath45 $ ] is arbitrary , and other fourier expansions than ( [ eq : kdistr ] ) are possible to consider .",
    "the point is , however , that it is always possible to approximate the dissipative behavior using a lossless model .",
    "it is often a reasonable assumption that inputs @xmath36 , for example voltages , are smooth if we look at a sufficiently fine time scale .",
    "this is because we usually can not change inputs arbitrarily fast due to physical limitations .",
    "physically , we can think of the approximation order @xmath62 as the number of degrees of freedom in a physical system , usually of the order of avogadro s number , @xmath91 .",
    "it is then clear that the interval length @xmath92 can be very large without making the approximation error bound in theorem  [ prop : errbound ] large .",
    "this explains how the dissipative system ( [ eq : diss ] ) is consistent with a physics based on energy conserving systems .",
