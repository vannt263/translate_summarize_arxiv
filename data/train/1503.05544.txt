    "the hubbard model has been initially introduced , _ inter alia _ , to describe metallic magnetism @xcite .",
    "this is frequently forgotten in recent research which focuses on other instabilities which are hidden and not so easy to investigate , as the instabilities of the fermi surface or the onset of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state is easily derived from the stoner criterion and occurs at sufficiently large local coulomb interaction @xmath6 .",
    "the stoner instability of a nonmagnetic state is determined using the hartree - fock approximation and is thus predicted for any lattice and filling of a nondegenerate band .",
    "however , it was soon realized that it does not imply ferromagnetism as electron correlations strongly renormalize the stoner parameter which follows from the hartree - fock approach and remove the fm instability in most cases .",
    "the metallic state of strongly correlated electrons in the nondegenerate hubbard model is a correlated fermi liquid which is characterized by the fermi liquid parameters . in the frequently considered model of a rectangular density of states ,",
    "the fm instability is absent .",
    "this conclusion follows also by considering the fermi - liquid antisymmetric parameter @xmath0 , which lower bound was found to be @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "indeed , ferromagnetism in a nondegenerate band is rare and only very few systems exist in nature which could be classified as itinerant ferromagnets with a single band , such as a weak itinerant ferromagnet zrzn@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "after several decades of research on the hubbard model , it became clear that the mechanism of itinerant ferromagnetism is subtle and other effects are needed to stabilize it .",
    "one of them is high degeneracy of the ground state @xcite realized when the band is flat @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism in realistic flat - band systems has been proposed for a triangular lattice of na@xmath11coo@xmath10 @xcite and for the @xmath12 orbitals in honeycomb lattices with ultracold atoms @xcite . in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model on a square lattice fm instability",
    "occurs at the van hove singularity of the density of states @xcite .",
    "it becomes relevant away from half filling when the band is flat due to the next neighbor hopping @xmath13 .",
    "this follows from a more general approach which predicts the fm instability by investigating the divergence of the uniform magnetic susceptibility .",
    "other factors which stabilize itinerant ferromagnetism in real materials go beyond the hubbard model itself  these are : ( i )  direct intersite exchange coupling @xcite , or ( ii )  band degeneracy with active hund s exchange coupling @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism is better known  it is responsible for ferromagnetism in transition metals fe , co and ni which have rather large magnetic moments and fm states occur in a degenerate @xmath14 band where hund s exchange plays a prominent role @xcite . also here",
    "the stoner parameter is strongly renormalized by the electron correlation effects @xcite , but the fm instability survives and is much easier to obtain than for the nondegenerate @xmath15 band @xcite .",
    "fm states have been investigated for realistic transition metals using different methods including more recent studies with the gutzwiller wave function @xcite .",
    "this subject is interdisciplinary and itinerant ferromagnetism plays also a role in a ferromagnet / insulator / superconductor ballistic junction @xcite , while the essential role played in the onset of ferromagnetism by the orbital degeneracy was also demonstrated recently for the multiband hubbard models on square and cubic lattices",
    "@xcite relevant both for @xmath12-orbital bands with ultracold fermions in optical lattices , and for electronic @xmath14-orbital bands in transition - metal oxides @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the extended nondegenerate hubbard model which describes the simplest correlated metals and investigate the influence of intersite coulomb and exchange interactions on the charge and magnetic instabilities .",
    "thereby we follow the route initiated by vollhardt @xcite who investigated landau fermi liquid parameters @xmath0 and @xmath5 for @xmath16he .",
    "further studies gave the fermi liquid interaction and the quasiparticle scattering amplitude on the fermi surface in @xmath16he @xcite .",
    "the perturbative method predicts the change of sign of the parameter @xmath0 in the 2d square lattice for small @xmath17 @xcite , where @xmath18 is the hopping parameter .",
    "the calculation within the slave boson method in the doped 2d hubbard model @xcite does not confirm this result and gives a negative @xmath0 in the entire range of @xmath6 and its saturation with increasing @xmath6 towards a negative value but larger than @xmath19 and nearly independent of the doping .",
    "this behavior confirms the earlier result that the nondegenerate hubbard model does not exhibit a fm instability even when @xmath6 is very large @xcite .",
    "we remark that saturated ferromagnetism near half filling and at @xmath20 which stems from the nagaoka state is nevertheless not excluded , as shown by several studies @xcite including a slave boson approach @xcite .",
    "this subject goes however beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "since mott insulating ground states arise at large @xmath6 and at half filling , we perform our investigations in a framework which is able to capture interaction effects beyond the physics of slater determinants .",
    "it is an extension of the kotliar and ruckenstein slave boson representation that reproduced the gutzwiller approximation on the saddle - point level @xcite .",
    "it entails the interaction driven brinkman - rice metal - to - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "a whole range of valuable results have been obtained with kotliar and ruckenstein @xcite and related @xcite slave boson representations which motivate the present study . in particular",
    "they have been used to describe antiferromagnetic @xcite , ferromagnetic @xcite , spiral @xcite and striped @xcite phases .",
    "furthermore , the competition between the latter two has been addressed as well @xcite . the influence of the lattice geometry on the metal - to - insulator transition was discussed , too @xcite .",
    "for instance , a very good agreement with quantum monte carlo simulations on the location of the metal - to - insulator transition for the honeycomb lattice has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "finally , further motivation comes from the strongly inhomogeneous polaronic states that have been found in correlated heterostructures using the hubbard model extended with intersite coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , comparison of ground state energies to existing numerical solutions have been carried out for the square lattice , too .",
    "for instance , for @xmath21 it could be shown that the slave boson ground state energy is larger than its counterpart by less than 3% @xcite . for larger values of @xmath6",
    ", it has been obtained that the slave boson ground state energy exceeds the exact diagonalization data by less than 4% ( 7% ) for @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and doping larger than 15% .",
    "the discrepancy increases when the doping is lowered @xcite .",
    "it should also be emphasized that quantitative agreement to quantum monte carlo charge structure factors was established @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive and evaluate fermi liquid landau parameters @xmath0 and @xmath5 for the metallic state in the extended hubbard model . despite of the above discussion on the fm instabilities ,",
    "the influence of intersite coulomb and exchange interactions on landau parameters was not analyzed in the hubbard model until now .",
    "we investigate the instabilities towards uniform fm order and charge instabilities using the spin rotation invariant ( sri ) representation @xcite of the kotliar and ruckenstein slave boson approach .",
    "we show analytically that weak fm intersite interactions are sufficient to trigger a divergence in the magnetic susceptibility expressed by the antisymmetric landau parameter @xmath0 which implies that the fm instability occurs due to such interactions for any lattice . for a representative example of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) cubic lattice",
    "we present also numerical analysis , and compare them at half filling with a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice .",

    "yet the hubbard model assumes a perfect screening of the long - range part of the coulomb interaction .",
    "this may be questionable and the relevance of this approximation may be assessed by considering the extended hubbard model that reads : @xmath26 and includes intersite coulomb @xmath27 and exchange @xmath28 interactions .",

    "we consistently use the particle - hole symmetric form for both density - density interaction terms .",
    "although one expects that @xmath35 , in certain cases effective intersite coulomb interactions may be attractive @xcite . therefore , we shall treat @xmath36 as effective parameters and consider both signs of them below .",

    "the dominating interaction is the superexchange and the antiferromagnetic coupling is expected . on the contrary , in a metallic system the direct exchange elements which arise from the coulomb interactions could be ferromagnetic .",

    "this finding confirms that electrons are strongly correlated and the system properties change radically at the metal - to - insulator transition at @xmath76 .",
    "hence we inspect now the case @xmath126 in more detail .",
    "we remark that the effect of finite @xmath3 first resembles somewhat that of finite @xmath2 for weak to moderate coupling : @xmath108 is reduced for attractive @xmath3 while it is enhanced for repulsive @xmath3 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : n=1 ] .",
    "the reduction of @xmath108 occurs only for sufficiently large @xmath207 and is visible in fig .",

    "we therefore suggest that a sufficiently strong intersite coulomb attraction @xmath211 is necessary to induce phase separation .",
    "the instability is absent for repulsive @xmath3 , where the uniform charge distribution is locally stable .",
    "we have presented the consequences of finite intersite interactions : exchange @xmath28 and coulomb @xmath27 , and their impact on the instabilities of correlated electrons on a cubic lattice in the nondegenerate band described by the extended hubbard model . while the hubbard model was originally introduced , _",
    "inter alia _ , to explain the metallic ferromagnetism , this idea fails as the model does not predict an instability of the metallic phase towards spin polarized ( weakly ferromagnetic ) states for the majority of lattices .",
    "such an instability is expected in first place at half filling where electron correlation effects are strongest , so this case is of particular significance .",
    "however , it is well known that the metal - to - insulator transition happens typically for a _ lower _ value of @xmath6 than the ferromagnetic instability , given by the divergence of spin susceptibility when the antisymmetric landau parameter takes the value @xmath152 .",
    "the analytic result derived in this paper shows that intersite exchange interactions change radically the results for the metallic phase below the metal - to - insulator transition near @xmath76 .",
    "if these interactions are globally ferromagnetic , a spin - polarized ground state occurs here before the system undergoes the metal - to - insulator transition , i.  e. , at @xmath166 .",
    "this result could be of importance to decide about the properties of some compounds with strongly correlated electrons , for instance , heavy fermion systems .",
    "somewhat surprisingly we have found that the symmetric ( charge ) landau parameter @xmath108 has a rather rich behavior when intersite coulomb interactions are included .",
    "small interactions do not change the value of @xmath108 significantly .",
    "most unexpected is the absence of a charge instability at half filling for moderate intersite coulomb interactions , independently of the sign of the intersite coulomb interaction , as it takes a sufficiently large attractive coulomb interactions @xmath211 for a charge instability to occur . for smaller @xmath207 , it develops in the intermediate regime of doping , i.  e. , for @xmath190 .",
    "it may be expected that the intersite coulomb elements are repulsive @xcite , except for systems with strong polaronic effects , which gives no charge instability . whether or not such interactions could be sufficiently attractive to cause an instability is an experimental challenge for future studies .    summarizing , we have shown that the landau parameters @xmath100 and @xmath108 are both sensitive to different intersite elements  @xmath100 is modified only by exchange elements , while @xmath108 only by coulomb elements .",
    "the present theory predicts a ferromagnetic instability in a strongly correlated metallic system with globally ferromagnetic exchange .",
    "the derived analytic result for @xmath100 eq . ( [ eq : f0a ] ) is very remarkable as it uncovers that for any lattice the hubbard model at half filling is at the verge of the ferromagnetic instability , which is triggered by an infinitesimal ferromagnetic intersite exchange .",
    "this result provides a new context for the original idea of kanamori @xcite who introduced the hubbard model as the simplest model of itinerant ferromagnetism .    at the same time",
    ", interesting behavior of the symmetric landau parameter @xmath108 was found for attractive nearest neighbor coulomb interactions .",
    "in contrast to @xmath100 , a more interesting result is found here away from half filling , where attractive interactions lead to charge instabilities signaling a tendency towards phase separation .",
    "we also remark that we investigated here only instabilities towards ferromagnetism or phase separation .",
