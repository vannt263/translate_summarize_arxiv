    "bose - einstein condensates with @xmath4-symmetric loss and gain have been proposed  @xcite as a first experimental realisation of @xmath4 symmetry in a real quantum system .",
    "the idea is to confine the condensate in a double well potential , and to create a @xmath4-symmetric situation by coherently injecting atoms into one well and removing them from the other .",
    "a particular difficulty in the theoretical treatment is that , on account of the s - wave scattering of the atoms , the gross - pitaevskii equation , which describes the condensates , contains a term @xmath5 , and thus is nonlinear in the wanted wave function . in a series of papers both for realistic set - ups as well as for delta - function models of the double wells",
    "we have shown @xcite that the nonlinearity introduces new features in the evolution of the eigenvalue spectrum as the non - hermiticity is increased but yet @xmath4 symmetry of the wave function is preserved if both nonlinearity and non - hermiticity are not too strong .",
    "bose - einstein condensates are usually trapped in harmonic potentials produced by counterpropagating laser beams",
    ". therefore condensates with an additional @xmath4-symmetric double well potential can be regarded as a  perturbation  of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "aducci and mityagin @xcite and siegl and mityagin @xcite have recently analysed perturbations of harmonic - like operators from a mathematical point of view .",
    "the second paper in particular also allows for singular perturbations , such as delta - functions .",
    "these authors have proved that the eigenvalues of the perturbed operator become eventually simple and the root system forms a riesz basis .",
    "their results are valid if the following criterion is fulfilled : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the perturbation operator , @xmath8 is a constant that depends on the type of the perturbation , and the @xmath9 are the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions .",
    "a further prediction is that the shrink rate of the disks into which the eigenvalues can be shifted is proportional to @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the exponent appearing in .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to test the estimates numerically for the example of a bose - einstein condensate in a double well potential confined by a harmonic trap . to this end",
    "we consider the model of two @xmath4-symmetric delta - function wells , since in this case simple analytical estimates can be obtained , whereas in the case of the realistic double well discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite complicated estimates in terms of hypergeometric functions result .",
    "it must be mentioned that of course because of their simplicity delta functions have widely been used in the literature in the context of @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "spectral properties of scattering and bound states in @xmath4-symmetric double- and multiple - delta function potentials have been investigated e.g. in refs @xcite . in all these papers no external potential was present , in additon to the delta potentials .",
    "a paper in which @xmath4-symmetric point interactions were studied embedded in an external potential is that by jakubsk and znojil @xcite who positioned the delta functions in an infinitely high square well and analysed the spectrum in dependence on the position of the delta functions within the well .",
    "their work was extended by krejik and siegl @xcite who replaced the delta functions by @xmath4-symmetric robin boundary conditions at the edges of the square well .",
    "we note that the spectrum of a harmonic oscillator perturbed by two identical real - valued point interactions has been analysed by fassari and rinaldi @xcite . but to our knowledge the situation of two @xmath4-symmetric delta functions in an external harmonic potential has not yet been investigated .",
    "while in the square well the delta functions can be placed only within the well , the harmonic oscillator potential has the advantage that the delta functions in principle can be shifted to any position on the real axis .",
    "at low temperatures and densities bose - einstein condensates are well described by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 denotes the condensate wave function , the eigenvalue @xmath14 is the chemical potential , and @xmath15 is the trapping potential to confine the condensate .",
    "the nonlinear term in ( [ eq : gpe ] ) arises from the s - wave scattering interaction of the atoms ; @xmath16 is a measure for the strength of this interaction .",
    "we consider a harmonic trapping potential and model a @xmath0-symmetric double well with equilibrated loss and gain by imaginary delta functions .",
    "thus the hamiltonian we consider is given by @xmath17 in ( [ eq : ham ] ) @xmath18 denotes the position of the imaginary deltas and @xmath19 the strength of the non - hermiticity we will later consider the effects of the nonlinearity on the spectrum , but for the time being assume that the nonlinearity is negligible in order to be in a position to compare with the predictions of mityagin and siegl @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the unperturbed spectrum are given by @xmath20 ( @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the unperturbed spectrum together with the wave functions of the lowest five states .",
    "the dashed vertical lines designate different positions at which the delta functions are placed . from the figure it is already obvious that only such states will be significantly affected by the perturbation which are within the classically allowed region at the positions the delta functions .",
    "by contrast , states for which the delta functions lie in the classically forbidden ( exponentially decaying ) regime will not be affected .",
    "this means that as the delta functions are shifted further and further out an increasing number of low - lying eigenvalues will not be changed by the perturbation .",
    "-symmetric delta - function perturbations .",
    "]    it is easy to show that the mityagin - siegl criterion is fulfilled for the imaginary delta function perturbation in since @xmath22 if @xmath23 and @xmath1 are both even or odd , while for @xmath23 even and @xmath1 odd , and vice versa , we have @xmath24 in the last line we have exploited an inequality given by mityagin and siegl @xcite which is valid for @xmath25 .",
    "the prediction then is that eigenvalues can only move to a distance @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is a constant , uniform for all eigenvalues , and in particular , that there exists an @xmath26 such that for @xmath27 all eigenvalues stay in disjoint disks with shrinking radii , with the shrink rate being bounded from above by @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , one of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite has pointed out @xcite that for the case of two delta potentials the shrink rate can be estimated even more precisely to behave as @xmath3 . note that no such statements can be made from their theorems for the case that the nonlinearity is also included as a perturbation .",
    "the ( real and complex ) eigenvalues @xmath14 of the hamiltonian and its eigenstates @xmath13 are obtained , both in the linear and the nonlinear case , by integrating the wave functions outward from @xmath29 , and varying the initial values of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 to find square - integrable normalised solutions ( the arbitrary global phase is exploited by choosing @xmath33 ) .",

    "one recognises that successive pairs of eigenvalues coalesce at branch points , from whereon they turn into complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the branch points are shifted to larger values of @xmath19 as one goes up in the spectrum .",
    "what is surprising is that both the real and imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues emerging from the branch point of the eighth and ninth excited state experience huge shifts , but eventually saturate , like the other levels . for the latter ,",

    "it is therefore no surprise that for @xmath43 the ground state no longer  feels  the delta functions , and no longer unites with the first excited state at a branch point .",
    "rather its eigenvalue remains real for any strength of the non - hermiticity .",
    "for @xmath39 it is the states with @xmath44 which exhibit this property .",
    "we note that similar behaviour was found by jakubsk and znojil @xcite in their @xmath4-symmetric square well model . in their terminology ,",
    "energy levels which coalesce at a branch point and turn complex are called  fragile  , while energy levels whose eigenvalues remain real for any strength of the perturbation are called  robust  .",
    "the latter also include states where the delta functions happen to be at or close to a node of the wave function , and therefore remain unaffected by the perturbation . examples of this can be seen in figure [ figure3 ] .    in figure [ figure2 ] the ground state coalesces with the first excited state , while in figure [ figure3 ] , at @xmath45 ( top panel ) , it has become a single real level for any value of @xmath19 , and the first excited state coalesces with the second excited one .",
    "the question arises how the transition between the different coalescence behaviour occurs .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ figure4 ] where the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues emerging from the ground state and the first two excited levels are shown as functions of @xmath19 , for three positions of the delta functions around @xmath46 .     at three different positions of the delta functions in the vicinity of @xmath47 .",
    "( top : real parts , bottom : imaginary parts of the eigenvalues . ) , title=\"fig : \" ]   at three different positions of the delta functions in the vicinity of @xmath47 .",
    "( top : real parts , bottom : imaginary parts of the eigenvalues . ) , title=\"fig : \" ]    it is evident that at @xmath48 the ground and first excited state still coalesce , giving rise to a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues which  collides  with the real eigenvalue of the second excited level .",
    "the latter then turns into another pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
    "the behaviour is similar for @xmath49 but here the pair of complex eigenvalues resulting from the merger of the ground and first excited state disappears by splitting into two real eigenvalues the lower of which remains real for any @xmath19 , while the higher after a small interval of @xmath19 coalesces with the real eigenvalue of the second excited state and a new pair of complex eigenvalues is born .",
    "finally , at @xmath50 the transition has occured , the ground state has become a single real level , and the two first excited states come together .",
    "we note again that similar behaviour was found by krejik and siegl @xcite in their studies of eigenvalues in a square well with robin boundary conditions ( cf .",
    "figure  6 in @xcite ) .",
    "we now proceed to results for nonvanishing nonlinearity .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] shows the spectrum for a value of @xmath51 with the delta functions placed at @xmath38 .    , evolving from the unperturbed levels with @xmath35 , for @xmath38 in dependence on the strength of the non - hermiticity .",
    "blue lines denote purely real eigenvalues , whereas real parts of complex eigenvalues ( single lines ) are shown in red . ]",
    "the overall behaviour is similar ( many states coalesce at branch points ) , but there are significant differences . like in our previous studies of @xmath4-symmetric hamiltonians with nonlinearity @xcite , pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues ( imaginary parts not shown )",
    "appear _ before _ the branch points are reached .",
    "again there exist  robust  levels whose eigenvalues remain real for any value of @xmath19 .",
    "for vanishing nonlinearity , the upper part of figure [ figure6 ] shows , for @xmath52 and different positions of the delta functions , the shifts of the eigenvalues as a function of the quantum number @xmath1 in comparison with the predicted shrink rates of @xmath53 of @xcite and the improved estimate of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it can be recognized that the @xmath53 dependence is indeed an upper bound on the shrink rate , and , moreover , that the improved estimate is in excellent agreement with the numerical data , irrespective of the position of the deltas !     and different positions of the delta functions in comparison with the mathematically estimated @xmath53 and @xmath3 dependence .",

    "top : vanishing nonlinearity , @xmath36 , bottom : @xmath54 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the picture changes when the nonlinearity is switched on .",
    "the bottom part of figure [ figure6 ] shows eigenvalue shifts for @xmath55 , and different positions of the imaginary delta potentials . from the comparison of the scales of the vertical axes in figure [ figure6 ]",
    "it can be seen that with nonlinearity the shifts even for the highest states are still bigger than 0.1 , while they have dropped already well below @xmath56 in the linear case .",
    "furthermore , the shrink rate is found to be slower ( approximately proportional to @xmath57 ) than predicted by both rigorous mathematical estimates for the linear case .",
    "we therefore find significant differences in the shrink rates with and without nonlinearity .    for small @xmath19 ,",
    "all eigenvalues are still real .",
    "the question therefore suggests itself how the situation changes when eigenvalues are involved that are shifted into the complex plane , which happens for increasing @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ figure7 ]     for @xmath34 , and @xmath58 . ]    shows for the eigenvalue spectra with @xmath37 , vanishing nonlinearity and different values of @xmath19 the distances @xmath59 of the real or complex eigenvalues from their original values ( cf . also figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the outlier at @xmath60 and @xmath61 is caused by the giant change of the real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalues beyond the branch point of the corresponding states observed already in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "a similar outlier occurs around @xmath62 , and a monotonous decrease of the eigenvalue shifts in our calculations only sets in for @xmath63 .",
    "finally in figure [ figure8 ]     for four different values of the nonlinearity at @xmath64 for @xmath65 ( top ) and @xmath45 ( bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ] +   for four different values of the nonlinearity at @xmath64 for @xmath65 ( top ) and @xmath45 ( bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ]    we investigate the effect of the nonlinearity on the eigenvalue shifts for @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath45 .",
    "we find that the eigenvalue shifts oscillate around straight lines with slopes -0.37 , irrespective of the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations , however , and their numbers depend on the position of the delta functions . again",
    "the slope of the estimate proportional to @xmath53 , also shown in the figure , is steeper than the actual slopes found in the numerical results .",
    "we have carried out a numerical analysis of a @xmath4-symmetric double delta perturbation of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we have also considered the case were in addition a gross - pitaevskii nonlinearity proportional to @xmath66 is present . with the latter ,",
    "the system can be considered as a model of a bose - einstein condensate in a double well with loss and gain of atoms .",
    "we have checked that the mityagin - siegl criterion for the perturbed eigenfunctions to form a riesz basis is fulfilled , and compared rigorous mathematical estimates for the shrink rate of the eigenvalue shifts in dependence on the harmonic oscillator quantum number @xmath1 for various strengths of the non - hermiticity and the nonlinearity .",
    "we have verified that in the linear case the mathematical prediction for the shrink rates proportional to @xmath2 is a valid estimate , and that the improved estimate proportional to @xmath3 is in excellent agreement with the behaviour of the shrink rates found in the numerical results . by contrast , with nonlinearity we find slopes of approximately @xmath67 , less steep than both mathematical estimates .",
    "evidently , to derive estimates also for the nonlinear case remains a mathematical challenge .",
    "a peculiarity found is the occurrence of outliers in the eigenvalue spectra which appear beyond branch points with unusually large real and imaginary parts of their complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
    "they are the reason why for growing strength of the non - hermiticity the asymptotic shrink rate behaviour is attained only for high values of @xmath1 .",
    "certainly the nature of these outliers and their mathematical importance should be clarified in future studies .",
    "we are grateful to petr siegl for helpful explanations and discussions .",
