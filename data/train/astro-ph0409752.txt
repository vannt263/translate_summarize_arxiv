    "a knowledge of the neutron star mass distribution provides a fundamental test of theories of the equation of state of nuclear matter , the applicability of general relativity as the correct theory of gravity and significant information on the evolutionary history of the progenitor stars . to date , only studies of millisecond radio pulsars have provided accurate mass determinations of neutron stars , reflecting their mass at formation ; 1.35@xmath10.04  @xmath6@xcite . although dynamical neutron star masses can also be obtained from accreting x - ray pulsars , there are large uncertainties . in high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs )",
    "there are uncertainties due to non - keplerian perturbations in the radial velocity curves caused by effects such as stellar wind contamination and x - ray heating . in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , the situation is worse because the intense x - ray irradiation usually suppresses the light from the donor @xcite .",
    "it is only in a few exceptional cases where the companion is evolved ( and hence more luminous ) or during x - ray off - states , when dynamical information can be extracted about the nature of the compact object .",
    "the sas-3 x - ray source , 2s  0921 - 630 , was identified with a @xmath716@xmath8 blue star @xcite , v395  car , whose optical spectrum is dominated by heii4686  and balmer emission @xcite , characteristics of lmxbs , with occasional superimposed late - type stellar absorption features visible @xcite .",
    "exosat observations showed a broad ( @xmath91  day ) , shallow x - ray eclipse , during which the spectrum softened @xcite , allowing an estimate of the size of the accretion - disc corona ( adc ) .",
    "this was comparable to the eclipsing companion star , thus accounting for the partial x - ray eclipse , and with an inclination of @xmath10=70@xmath1190@xmath11 .",
    "only a handful of adc sources are known in which the compact object is permanently obscured from our line - of - sight by the accretion disc , and requires the observed x - rays to be scattered in a hot corona @xcite . by implication ,",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity is _ much _ higher .",
    "limited optical photometry and emission line spectroscopy @xcite shows that 2s0921630/v395  car  has a long orbital period of 9.02day and deep ( @xmath71 mag ) dips where the @xmath12 colour reddens by up to 0.4 mags , which has been interpreted as the eclipse of the disc by the late - type secondary @xcite .",
    "high - resolution optical spectroscopy revealed the donor star to be of spectral type k0iii with a rotational velocity of @xmath13=65@xmath19@xmath2 , contributing @xmath725% to the observed flux at 6500  @xcite .",
    "2s0921630/v395  caris one of those rare lmxbs in which the secondary is visible despite the presence of a luminous disc . there has been no detection of type i x - ray bursts , so the nature of the compact object is unclear . in this letter we present the results of an intensive campaign to measure the dynamical mass of the compact object in 2s0921630/v395  car .",
    "we determine the secondary star s radial velocity curve , investigate the possible effects of x - ray irradiation and obtain firm constraints on the compact object mass .",
    "time resolved spectroscopic observations of 2s0921630/v395  car  were obtained on the 1.9-m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) during 2003 march 30 to april 18 .",
    "grating # 5 ( 1200 lines / mm ) was used centered at 4900  and covering a wavelength range of 45295377with a dispersion of 0.49 / pixel@xmath14 . a slit width of 2.0gave a spectral resolution of 1.1    ( = 64  @xmath2  at 5200 ) as measured from the cu - arc arc lines . in general the conditions were good , with the seeing varying between 13 . a total of 83 spectra of 2s0921630/v395  carwere obtained with an exposure time of 1800s .",
    "each spectrum was bracketed by an observation of the internal cu - ar arc lamp at the position of the star .",
    "template field stars of a variety of spectral types were also observed .",
    "the images were flat - fielded using observations of a tungsten calibration lamp , and a constant bias level was subtracted from all the images .",
    "extraction of the 1-d spectra from the images were performed using optimal extraction @xcite and calibration of the wavelength scale was achieved using 4th order polynomial fits to the position measured arc - line positions , which gave an rms scatter of @xmath70.02   .",
    "in addition , 34 spectra were also obtained at the very large telescope ( vlt ; paranal , chile ) , new technology telescope ( ntt ; la silla , chile ) the anglo australian telescope ( aat ; siding springs , australia ) and at the magellan telescope ( las campanas , chile ) as part of a long - term project on x - ray binaries .",
    "we used the fors2 spectrograph attached to the 8.2 m yepun telescope ( vlt ) on the nights of 2003 may 18 and june 22 - 23 .",
    "a total of 9 spectra with exposure times in the range 300 to 900s were obtained .",
    "the r1400v holographic grating was used in combination with a 0.7slit resulting in a wavelength coverage of 45145815  and a resolution of 70@xmath2 .",
    "instrumental flexure was monitored by cross - correlating the sky spectra and was found to be very small , always within 6@xmath2 .",
    "the magellan spectra were obtained on 2003 dec 1216 using the baade telescope at las campanas using the imacs imaging spectrograph in long - camera mode .",
    "a total of 11 spectra with an exposure time of 300s were obtained .",

    "the aat spectra were obtained using the rgo spectrograph on the nights of 2002 june 6 to 11 .",
    "a total of 10 spectra with an exposure time of 1800s were obtained . the r1200b grating centered at 4350  together with a 1.0slit provided spectra covering 3500 - 5250  with a resolution of 70@xmath2 .",
    "the total of 4 ntt spectra were obtained with emmi and grating # 6 on the nights of 2002 june 8 to 10 exposure times of 600 to 900s .",
    "the spectra cover the spectral range 44005150  with a resolution of 75@xmath2 .",
    "the aat and ntt data reduction details are given in @xcite .",
    "to increase the signal - to - noise of the spectra prior to cross - correlation , the individual spectra were variance averaged into nighly means or groups of @xmath73hrs , depending on the quality of the individual spectra .",
    "a total of 31 absorption line radial velocities were measured by cross - correlation @xcite with a template star . prior to cross - correlation",
    ", the spectra were interpolated onto a constant velocity scale ( 32 @xmath2pixel@xmath14 ) and normalized by fitting a spline function to the continuum .",
    "the region 51005300  common to all the spectra , primarily containing the mgi ( 5167.3 , 5172.7  and 5183.6 ) absorption blend was used in the analysis .",
    "the template star s radial velocity , determined using the position of the fei 4957.597  absorption line , was then added to the radial velocities of 2s0921630/v395  car .",
    "the resulting radial velocity data ( see figure[rvcurve ] ) were then fitted with a circular orbit ( sinusoidal function ) using the method of least - squares .",
    "using spectral type template stars in the range g6k4iii we obtain @xmath0 values in the range 9299  @xmath2(see table  [ rvfit ] ) .",
    "the secondary star s spectral type has previously been determined from high - resolution spectroscopy to be k0iii @xcite , and our work confirms this .",
    "fitting the radial velocities with a k0iii template star , we find a minimum reduced @xmath15 of 4.3 with the best fit parameters @xmath3 = 34.9@xmath13.3 @xmath2 @xmath0 = 92.89@xmath13.84 @xmath2 @xmath4=9.0035@xmath10.0029 day and @xmath16=hjd2453099.51@xmath10.08 , where @xmath4 is the orbital period , @xmath16 is time at phase 0.0 defined as inferior conjunction of the secondary star , @xmath3 is the systemic velocity and @xmath0 is the radial velocity semi - amplitude ( 1-@xmath5 errors are quoted with the error bars rescaled so that the reduced @xmath15 of the fit is 1 . )",
    "our ephemeris is consistent with that determined by @xcite .",
    "we also computed a @xmath15 periodogram of the data to investigate the significance of other periods .",
    "no significant peaks ( at @xmath999.99 % level ) were present other than the one at 9.0035day . finally , to check if the 9.0035day period is affected by an alias , we computed the window function ; no significant peaks were present at 9.0035day .",
    "fitting the radial velocity data with an eccentric orbit did not yield a better fit ; the eccentric fit is only significant at the 38% level .    using a distance of @xmath710kpc @xcite 2s0921630/v395",
    "car  lies 1.6kpc below the galactic plane and so belongs to the halo population .",
    "note the systemic velocity is not consistent with the radial velocity due to galactic differential rotation , @xmath760  @xmath2  at a distance of @xmath710kpc @xcite .",
    "however , what is interesting is that the magnitude of the systemic velocity of 2s0921630/v395  car  seems to be about a factor of @xmath74 lower compared to other neutron star halo systems ( @xcite ) .    in figure[spectrum ]",
    "we show the variance - weighted doppler averaged spectrum of v395  car .",
    "the strongest features are the h , he emission lines , which appear single peaked , even at the resolution of these data .",
    "weak absorption features of mg i 5175  and the ca / fe blend at 5269  allow us to determine the fraction of light from the secondary star , by optimally subtracting a scaled k0iii template spectrum from v395  car @xcite .",
    "as the rotational broadening of the donor ( 65@xmath19  @xmath2 ; @xcite ) is similar to our spectral resolution ( 64  @xmath2 ) , we do not broaden the template before subtraction .",
    "we find that the secondary star contributes @xmath17% to the observed flux at 5200  ( see table  [ rvfit ] ) .",
    "the observed x - rays are reflected into our line of sight by scattering .",
    "although the observed x - ray luminosity is low @xmath18ergs@xmath14 @xcite , it is still interesting to explore the possible effects that x - rays may have on the secondary star s atmosphere and hence radial velocity .",
    "we investigate these effects using the x - ray binary model described by @xcite . we first phase - folded the radial velocities using the orbital ephemeris derived in section[radvel ] and binned into 31 orbital phase bins .",
    "we then fit the resulting radial velocity curve with the x - ray binary model .",
    "we considered two extreme cases for the x - ray irradiation : case ( a ) where the x - rays produced near the compact object irradiate the whole inner face of the secondary star and case ( b ) where the x - ray s do not affect the secondary star .",
    "note that invoking a flared accretion disc will have intermediate solutions .",
    "the variable model parameters are the compact object mass @xmath19 , secondary star mass @xmath20 , x - ray luminosity @xmath21 and the inclination @xmath10 . to determine which elements on the star contribute to the absorption line radial velocity we use the factor @xmath22 , which is the fraction of the external radiation flux that exceeds the unperturbed flux . for a given @xmath10 and combination of @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "we fit the data and use the constraints imposed by the measured value for @xmath13 ( 64@xmath19@xmath2 ; @xcite ) to produce plots in the @xmath19@xmath20 plane ( figure[masses ] )    given the evidence for optical and x - ray partial eclipse , @xmath10 must lie in the range 70@xmath1190@xmath11 .",
    "therefore we consider cases ( a ) and ( b ) for @xmath10=70@xmath11 and more importantly @xmath10=90@xmath11 , because it gives a firm lower limit to the compact object s mass . for",
    "case ( a ) we fix @xmath18ergs@xmath14 and find that the best fit ( @xmath15 = 122 ) is obtained when all the elements on the inner face contribute to the radial velocity , i.e. @xmath23 60% , i.e. x - ray heating is not preferred .",
    "note , however , that the radial velocity curve will not be sinusoidal because there will still be some irradiated elements that contribute to the radial velocity .",
    "even if we increase to @xmath24ergs@xmath14 as could be the case for an lmxb , the fits are significantly worse ( @xmath15 = 190 ) and the best fit still occurs when all the inner face contributes to the radial velocity . for case ( b ) we set @xmath25 , implying no x - ray heating and find that it gives a fit with similar quality ( @xmath15 = 119 ) .",
    "we conclude that the best fit to the radial velocity curve is the case where the x - rays do not have an observable effect given the quality of the data . for our range in @xmath10",
    "our fits for case ( a ) and ( b ) give 2.0 @xmath26 4.3  @xmath6  ( 1-@xmath5 ) , which means we can rule out a canonical 1.4@xmath6  neutron star at the 99% level .",
    "our solutions for the compact object mass suggests either a massive neutron star or a low - mass black hole , since the maximum mass allowed for a neutron star is 2.9  @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "since the donor star fills its roche lobe and is synchronized with the binary motion , we use the secondary star s @xmath13 and @xmath0 to determine the binary mass ratio @xmath27=(@xmath28)=0.89@xmath10.18 @xcite . given the measured masses and orbital period , we use kepler s third law to determine the semi - major axis 56.1@xmath2972.4@xmath30 .",
    "eggleton s ( 1983 ) expression for the effective radius of the roche - lobe then determines the radius of the secondary 10.4@xmath3113.4@xmath30 , and the temperature inferred from the spectral type @xcite and stefan - boltzmann s law determines the luminosity 52.5@xmath3287.1@xmath33(1-@xmath5 ranges are quoted ) .",
    "the position of the secondary star of 2s0921630/v395  car  in an hr diagram corresponds to a normal star that has crossed the hertzsprung gap and now lies on the hayashi line .",
    "the evolution of the binary is dominated by the evolution of the evolved secondary star .",
    "since such a star no longer burns hydrogen in its core , the mass transfer is early massive case b. for a binary with a secondary star near the onset of such mass transfer , one requires @xmath341 throughout its history @xcite .",
    "the case for a 1.4  @xmath6  neutron star can be ruled out since it requires @xmath351.4  @xmath6 , which is inconsistent with our results ; the position of a secondary on the hr diagram undergoing early massive case b mass transfer is close to that of a single star of the same mass @xcite . for a 3  @xmath6  compact object , @xmath363.0  @xmath6 , which is consistent with our observations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mass ratio we derive lies on the limit of stable / unstabe mass transfer @xmath27=5/6 @xcite .",
    "it is possible that 2s0921630/v395  car   is undergoing unstable mass transfer similar to the supersoft sources and other x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "the distribution of measured neutron stars masses provides fundamental constraints on the equation of state of nuclear matter and the observational identification of a black hole which is based on the maximum gravitational mass allowed for a neutron star ; 2.9  @xmath6  @xcite",
    ". studies of radio pulsars show that neutron star masses are clustered in a narrow range . however , there is some evidence that neutron stars with a mass in excess of 1.4  @xmath6  do exist .",
    "lmxbs are expected to contain massive ( @xmath72  @xmath6 ) neutron stars , resulting from the accretion of a considerable amount of material over extended ( 10@xmath37  yrs ) periods of time @xcite . however , while a neutron star mass of 1.78@xmath10.23  @xmath6  for the lmxb cygx-2 is reported @xcite , @xcite have recently proposed a mass of 1.44@xmath10.06  @xmath6  based on the spectral and temporal properties of the type i x - ray bursts .",
    "the analysis of optical data for the x - ray pulsar velax-1 suggests that the pulsar has a mass of 1.87@xmath38  @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "probably the strongest case for a massive neutron star or low - mass black hole is in the eclipsing hmxb 4u170037 which contains a 2.44@xmath10.27@xmath6  compact object @xcite .",
    "such masses already test soft nuclear equations of state @xcite .",
    "we obtain a mass of 2.04.3  @xmath6  for the compact object in 2s0921630/v395  car , which lies between the range of masses observed for neutron stars and black holes .",
    "models for nuclear equations of state which include the effects of three nucleon interactions and realistic models of nuclear forces limits the maximum mass of neutron stars to be below 2.5  @xmath6@xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that unconventional forms of matter such as q - stars do allow the existence of extremely massive neutron stars @xcite although our results do not allow us to distinguish between a massive neutron star or a low mass black hole , the existence of a @xmath92.5  @xmath6neutron star would place strong constraints on high density nuclear matter .",
    "theoretical predictions by @xcite suggest that the death of a 60  @xmath6  star in a close binary system can produce anything from a low - mass 1.2  @xmath6  neutron star to a 10  @xmath6  black hole , depending on the wind mass - loss rate during the wolf - rayet phase .",
    "as suggested by @xcite the formation of a low - mass black hole with a high space velocity is possible via a two stage process involving the formation of a neutron star .",
    "however , if there is symmetric mass ejection in the supernova , then a kick at the formation of a black hole is not required to explain the varied range in the observed space velocities of the black hole lmxbs @xcite .    the unusual mass for the compact object in 2s0921630/v395  car  and the fact that the nature of the compact object is not clear , conjours up many formation scenarios .",
    "if it is a neutron star , then its present mass can be explained by either the accumulation of matter ( 12  @xmath6 ) by a canonical 1.4  @xmath6  neutron star , accreted at a high mass accretion rate over a long period of time , or the direct collapse of a massive star forming a massive neutron star .",
    "if the compact object in 2s0921630/v395  car  is a black hole then its low mass can be explained by the accretion induced collapse of a massive 2.9  @xmath6  neutron star or the formation of a low - mass black hole @xcite .",
    "given the fact that we do not observe a peculiar systemic velocity comparable to other neutron - star lmxbs , this suggests that we can rule out canonical neutron star formation scenarios where a kick is produced during a type ii supernova .",
    "the most likely scenario for the formation of the compact object is the direct formation of a massive neutron star or a low - mass black hole .",
