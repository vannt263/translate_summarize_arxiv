    "in contrast , for antiferromagnetic potts ( afp ) model , the order parameter is not only associated with the spins but also with the underlying lattice .",

    "the three - state afp model show good examples of such phase transitions . in three - dimensional simple - cubic lattice , when temperature is high , the model is disordered ;",
    "when temperature is sufficiently low , some long - range order develops , and the following states could be favored : the spins on one of the sublattices are  frozen \" at a random potts value , and the spin on any site of the remaining lattice is  free \" to take the other potts values . in refs . and",
    ", such states are called  ideal \" states . on the simple cubic lattice , there are six types of such ideal states .",
    "thus , the order parameter is of the @xmath4 symmetry .",

    "the model is ferromagnetic when @xmath24 or antiferromagnetic when @xmath25 . in the current paper , we focus on the antiferromagnetic case and set @xmath26 for convenience .    the potts spin @xmath27 can also be written as unit vector in the plane @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the angle of the spin .",
    "the hamiltonian of the three - state potts model becomes then @xmath30 apart from a constant .    for monte carlo simulations of the three - state antiferromagnetic potts model on the single - layer square lattice ,",
    "the wang - swendsen - kotek ( wsk ) algorithm @xcite is efficient even at zero temperature . on the two - layer lattice ,",
    "the algorithm still works but the efficiency drops . at the low temperatures of the four - layer square lattice , the efficiency drops so much that it becomes difficult to give reliable data for systems of moderate sizes . to overcome this problem",
    ", we implement the geometric cluster algorithm@xcite .",
    "it is shown that a combination of the geometrical algorithm , the wsk algorithm and the metropolis algorithm significantly improves the efficiency , which enables us to extensively simulate systems with linear size up to @xmath31 .",
    "the sampled observables in our monte carlo simulations include the staggered magnetization @xmath32 , the staggered susceptibility @xmath33 , the uniform magnetization @xmath34 , the uniform susceptibility @xmath35 , and the specific heat @xmath36 , which are defined as @xmath37 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coordination , @xmath43 is the number of sites of the lattice .",
    "the staggered magnetization @xmath32 can be conveniently used to probe the breaking of the @xmath4 symmetry in the ordered phase .",
    "we also sample the correlation length @xmath44 on one sublattice of a given layer .",
    "specifically , a layered square lattice is divided to two equivalent sublattices according to the parity of @xmath45 , denoted by ",
    "sublattice a \" and  sublattice b \" ; the @xmath46-th layer of sublattice a is denoted by @xmath47 . the in - layer sublattice correlation length @xmath44 is then defined as@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the  smallest wavevector \" of the square lattice along the @xmath50 direction  i.e . , @xmath51 . the in - layer sublattice susceptibility @xmath52 and the  structure factor \" @xmath53 are @xmath54 in a critical phase , quantity @xmath55 assumes a universal value in the thermodynamic limit @xmath56 . in a disordered phase ,",
    "correlation length @xmath44 is finite and @xmath55 drops to zero , while in an ordered phase , @xmath55 diverges quickly since  structure factor \" @xmath53 vanishes rapidly .",

    "this is shown more clearly by the log - log plot of @xmath32 versus @xmath59 for given temperatures , as shown in the right of fig .",
    "we find that the magnetization @xmath32 in the low temperatures can be described by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the spatial dimension , and @xmath62 is renormalization exponent of the staggered magnetic field , which varies continuously with the temperature . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the correction - to scaling terms , with @xmath65 .",

    "the meaning of the scaling behavior of @xmath32 in the low - temperature region is twofold : first , it means that the staggered magnetization in the low - temperature region also converges to zero as the system size increases to infinite ( because @xmath69 ) .",
    "this means that in the thermodynamic limit the @xmath4 symmetry in the system is not broken , namely the system does nt have long - range order on the sublattices .",

    "emergent @xmath9 symmetry is found in the quasi - long - range ordered phase .",
    "the critical properties of the three - state afp model on the square lattice are related to the vortex excitations , which is investigated by kolafa@xcite using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the simulations show that the positive and negative vortices are bound into dipoles only at the zero temperature ; at any temperature @xmath121 , the dipoles unbind . there is no quasi - lro phase in the single - layer afp model .",
    "however , our simulations show that the multilayer structure can lead to a quasi - lro phase .",
    "this is due to the modifications of the ground states by the layered structure . on a bipartite lattice such as the square lattice , the simple cubic lattice , or the layered square lattice , the density of entropy of the ideal states is @xmath122 . on the square lattice ,",
    "the density of total entropy of the model is @xmath123@xcite .",
    "the ratio is @xmath124 . on the simple cubic lattice @xmath125 and @xmath126 . for the layered square lattice , although we have not numerically calculated its entropy density , we believe it is reasonable to postulate that the value of @xmath127 is between 0.803 and 0.945 ; and it will gradually increase as the number of layers increases .",
    "the increase of @xmath127 means the enhancement of the effect of ideal states , which will restrict the vortex excitations with nonzero charge , because the vortex excitations based on ideal states favor zero charge . as pointed out by ref .",
    ", the zero charge does not dominate the leading critical properties of the model .",
    "therefore , comparing to the single - layer model , the multilayer model needs higher temperature to generate vortices with nonzero charge , thus the quasi - lro phase of the two - layer model enters the region with @xmath121 . another obvious result of the increase of @xmath127 is the enhancement of the effect of @xmath4 symmetry , which tends to make the system be ordered .",
    "however when the number of layers is two , the effect is not strong enough .",
    "when the number of layers increases to four , it is strong enough to lead to an ordered phase .",
    "the phase diagram of the four - layer square - lattice afp model is very similar to that of the single - layer square - lattice afp model with ferromagnetic nnn interactions@xcite . for the latter , the ferromagnetic nnn interactions have similar effect as that of the multilayer structure ; it also enhances the @xmath4 symmetry and restricts the vortex excitations with nonzero charge .",
    "however , the two model still have some subtle difference . for the single - layer model ,",
    "if the ratio of the strength of the nnn interactions and the nn interactions takes fixed nonzero value , the system must be ordered at zero temperature .",
    "in such a case , it does not have a single bkt transition like that in the two - layer lattice .",
    "furthermore , the entropy of the ground states of the single - layer model is not extensive ; this is obviously different to that of the multilayer lattice , although it does nt lead to substantial difference in critical behaviors .    for ferromagnetic model on multilayered lattice",
    ", the phase transition behavior belongs to the same universality class as that in the corresponding single - layer lattice@xcite , according to the hypothesis of universality .",
    "however , for antiferromagnetic model , due to the lattice structure dependence nature of the model , the number of layers may lead to substantially different behavior of phase transition from that in the corresponding single - layer lattice .",
