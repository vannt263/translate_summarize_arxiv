    "in the standard model ( sm ) the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath1 is the quark mixing coupling factor in the weak charged current connecting the i - th u - type quark to the j - th d - type quark and the @xmath2  @xcite . with three",
    "generations four real parameters are needed to describe the unitarity ckm matrix @xmath3 , among which there is an irreducible phase which governs all cp violating phenomena .",
    "the unitarity relation built from the @xmath4 and @xmath5 columns of @xmath3 defines a triangle in the complex plane .",
    "it is convenient to normalize the sides and to measure the phases with respect to @xmath6 , obtaining the unitarity triangle called the ut in the following .",
    "its apex represents the complex number : z = + i - whose imaginary part @xmath7 governs cp violation . in other words ,",
    "cp non - conservation means that the triangle is not squashed .",
    "its angles @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) at the apex , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) at the origin and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) differ from 0 or 180@xmath14 .",
    "use of the wolfenstein parameterization  @xcite is customary with the definitions : @xmath15 @xmath16 is the sine of the cabibbo angle and @xmath17 is a real number of order unity .",
    "@xmath18 is the opposite of the phase of @xmath19 .",
    "many measurements contrain the apex of the ut .",
    "dedicated teams produce global fits .",
    "i use the results of the ckmfitter group  @xcite .",
    "they are in fair agreement with those of the utfit group  @xcite , presented in another lecture  @xcite at this conference .    the global fit pictured in figure  [ fig : ckmfitter ] and summarized in table  [ tab : ckmfitter ] shows the agreement of the experiments with the sm .",
    "while the cabibbo angle is precisely measured , the accuracy on the other parameters ranges between 4 and 20% . in",
    "the following i review a subset of recent measurements of the angles and the sides of the ut .",
    ".global fit results from ckmfitter  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties are quoted at the 68% confidence level .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      using all measurements of @xmath22 charmonium + @xmath23 the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag ) determines  @xcite @xmath24 which translates into either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "the former value is slightly preferred experimentally and matches the other contraints in the global ckm fit wich validates the sm .",
    "it has to be noted that the most recent measurements done using dalitz - plot amplitude analyses ( e.g for @xmath27  @xcite ) determine the angle @xmath20 without trigonometric ambiguity .",
    "however they are less precise .",
    "the @xmath21 angle is precisely determined by the @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 decays , analyzed using isospin relations to disentangle tree and penguin decay paths . combining all experimental results the ckmfitter group finds @xmath31 which compares well to the global fit ( leaving the @xmath8 measurements aside ) result , @xmath32 .    in summary the measurements of the angles @xmath20 and @xmath33 alone",
    "constrain the apex of the ut enough to establish that cp is violated in @xmath34 decays .",
    "the determination of the @xmath35 angle is not yet accurate enough to further constrain the km model .",
    "the glw , ads and ggsz methods are effective at lhcb . with them",
    "very clean measurements of the @xmath36 angle in pure tree processes will be obtained which will establish a solid basis for new physics searches in @xmath10-sensitive decays proceeding via loop diagrams .",
    "i refer to the recent review of the determination of @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the semileptonic @xmath34 meson decays at the b - factories  @xcite and the compilation of the review of particle properties  @xcite . with increased statistics ,",
    "well established analysis techniques still progress . tagged samples of @xmath39 events where the _ other _",
    "@xmath34 meson is reconstructed now contribute .",
    "event selection algorithms have been devised that increase the acceptance of @xmath40 decays over wide kinematical ranges .",
    "inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays are both relevant .",
    "the former are modeled theoretically using operator product expansions ( ope ) by expressions in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath42 with useful commonalities with those describing the @xmath43 inclusive radiative decays .",
    "the exclusive semilptonic decays rely on sets of form factors conform to heavy quark symmetry and lattice qcd ( lqcd ) computations .",
    "@xmath37 is also constrained by the purely leptonic @xmath44 decay , simpler to model but with a dependence on the @xmath34 meson decay constant to be computed from lqcd .",
    "the current exclusive @xmath46 measurements combined with a recent unquenched lattice calculation  @xcite lead to @xmath47 , where the experimental uncertainty is quoted first followed by that of the lqcd calculations . a new tagged analysis from  @xcite of @xmath48",
    "has a significantly improved accuracy . with an unquenched lattice form factor calculation  @xcite",
    ", it leads to @xmath49 .",
    "global fits to the inclusive decay rates and @xmath50 moments of the lepton energy and hadronic mass spectra  @xcite as well the @xmath43 photon energy spectrum  @xcite are performed to extract @xmath38 , hadronic coefficients and the quark mass within a given renormalization scheme .",
    "the average  @xcite for inclusive decays is @xmath51 .",
    "the agreement between the @xmath37 determinations from exclusive and inclusive decays is marginal .",
    "the uncertainties have to be scaled up in order to quote the average @xmath52 .      because the rates are suppressed",
    ", the background from @xmath53 processes is high and the inclusive measurements are harder .",
    "strict selections are implemented which reduce the accepted phase space .",
    "therefore the applicability of ope is impaired unless one uses a _",
    "shape function _  @xcite .",
    "weak annihilations contribute .",
    "furthermore , a recent calculation  @xcite shows that qcd effects at the nnlo are sizeable . with high statistics",
    "however , innovative analysis techniques are implemented .",
    "for instance , with multivariate techniques belle  @xcite accesses 90% of the available phase space .",
    "inclusive determinations average  @xcite to : @xmath54 , where the first uncertainty is experimental , the second is from the spread of theoretical results and the third is the nnlo effect .",
    "a preliminary result from  @xcite on @xmath55 comes out of a fit of the differential branching fraction as a function of @xmath56 which uses data points from the experiment as well as from a lattice calculation  @xcite .",
    "the result , @xmath57 where the uncertainty combines the experimental and theoretical contributions , is lower by @xmath58 from previous averages .",
    "there again and more significantly than for @xmath38 , the exclusive and inclusive averages are far apart .",
    "recent findings tend to increase the discrepancy .",
    "this should be kept in mind when considering that the global ckm fits inputs are the averages of the exclusive and inclusive determinations of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "a stronger feature involving @xmath37 comes from the determination of the @xmath44 branching fraction .",
    "a higher value than that from the semileptonic decays is preferred by the data from  and belle and this bring a much discussed tension in the global ckm fits with the constraint from @xmath59 .",
    "i refer to the thorough description of that issue  @xcite at this workshop .",
    "the @xmath61 side of the ut remains to be discussed .",
    "the most accurate relevant contraints come from measurements  @xcite of @xmath62 , currently dominated by @xmath63 mixing  @xcite .",
    "a new  measurement  @xcite of the inclusive decays to @xmath64 brings a contribution with independent systematic uncertainties : @xmath65 , where the last uncertainty after the statistical and the systematic components is from theory .",
    "for lack of time in capri and lack of place here , i do not describe two topics .",
    "recent attempts to check the unitarity of the first row of the ckm matrix using strange and non - strange @xmath0 decays are conclusive with exclusive ( @xmath66 and k@xmath67 ) decays ; but not yet with inclusive ones . to date ,",
    "there no evidence of cp violation in @xmath68 meson mixing .",
    "cp violation in @xmath34 meson decays has been established .",
    "the km model works to explain cp violation phenomena observed with quarks .",
    "the global ckm fits reveal some tensions .",
    "the contrary would be suspicious ... none are overwhelming .",
    "each should be scrutinized .",
    "there is room for new physics which could appear as corrections of order 10% to flavor parameters .",
    "many measurements are statistically limited .",
    "now is the time of the hadron machines ( tevatron , lhcb ) .",
    "hopefully new physics will unveil .",
    "however colliders are invaluable to pursue a comprehensive experimental program .",
    "still the antimatter problem remains unexplained .",
    "i am very grateful to have been invited at the capri workshop .",
    "many thanks to the organisers , the  collaboration and to lpnhe and in2p3/cnrs . special thanks to the ckmfitter group for sharing their most recent results",
