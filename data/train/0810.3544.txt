    "the liquids @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the only quantum liquids which exist naturally . the word  quantum liquid \" comes from the fact that for these systems",
    ", the interatomic distance is at the order of their de broglie wavelenght .",
    "@xmath0 is a liquid of strongly interacting fermionic atoms which behaves quite differently than the normal liquids at low temperature ( wilks , 1970 ; kent , 1993 ) .",
    "the properties of liquid @xmath0 have been studied using different many - body techniques ( clark and westhaus , 1966 ; nafari and doroudi , 1995 ; luijen and meyer , 2000 ; kindermann and wetterich , 2001 ; takano and yamada , 1994 ; viviani et al . , 1988 ; pricaupenko and treiner , 1995 ; fantoni et al . , 1982 ; krotscheck and smith , 1983 ; friman and krotscheck , 1982 ) .",
    "recently , the behavior of liquid @xmath0 near its critical point has been investigated using path - integral molecular dynamics and quantum virial expansion ( mer and luijten , 2002 ) .",
    "one of the most powerful techniques in many - body calculations is the variational method which is based on the cluster expansion of the energy functional ( lowest order constrained variational method ) ( owen et al . , 1977 ;",
    "bordbar and modarres , 1997 , 1998 ; modarres and bordbar , 1998 ; bordbar and riazi , 2001 , 2002 ; bordbar , 2002a , 2002b , 2003 , 2004 ; bordbar and hashemi , 2002 ) .",
    "this is a fully self - consistent method and does not introduce any free parameter to the calculations . the crucial point in this method",
    "is the functional minimization with respect to the two - body correlation function subjected to the normalization constraint which finally leads to a euler - lagrange differential equation .",
    "the convergence of its results has been shown by computing the three - body cluster energy term ( bordbar and modarres , 1997 ) .",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition near the critical point ( second - order phase transition ) is an interesting subject in statistical mechanics .",
    "this behavior , critical phenomena , is caused by the existence of singularity in thermodynamic functions of the system at the transition point .",
    "the nature of these singularities in various measurable quantities at the critical point is described by the critical exponents .    in our previous paper , we have calculated some thermodynamic properties of liquid @xmath0 using the variational method shows a nice agreement between experimental data and calculated results especially for free energy and entropy ( bordbar and hashemi , 2002 ) . in this article , we present the critical behavior of the liquid @xmath0 .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in section [ crit ] , we obtain the critical properties of liquid @xmath0 by calculating the critical isotherm .",
    "we investigate the critical behavior of liquid @xmath0 by computing the critical point exponents in section [ exponent ] .",
    "the equation of state is the key point for investigating the second - order phase transition in a hydrostatic system .",
    "the isothermal equation of state can be calculated from the helmholtz free energy , @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pressure , temperature and number density , respectively . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the total number of particles and volume . to obtain the free energy of liquid @xmath0 , we use the variational method explained in appendix . the result for the equation of state at the critical temperature ( critical isotherm )",

    "the experimental results ( heller , 1967 ; fisher , 1967 ; pittman et al . , 1979 ) are also given for comparison .",
