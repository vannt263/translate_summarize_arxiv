    "the formation of bound states in nuclear collisions has been investigated experimentally and theoretically for many decades . on the experimental side",
    "the fragmentation of the source has been studied extensively at very low energies to extract information about the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition @xcite , while on the theoretical side those observations were studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "already very early it was pointed out that deuteron production can be used to infer thermodynamic properties of the system , e.g. the entropy per baryon @xcite . at higher energies around @xmath0 gev ,",
    "the data become more scarce . here , the ags experiments have provided data on the formation of clusters up to helium @xcite , while the sps experiments have measured data on clusters up to mass three @xcite even for the anti - particle sector @xcite .",
    "currently the rhic and lhc experiments have also shown data on light ( anti-)nuclei production at the highest energies , see e.g. @xcite . theoretically , the mechanism for cluster production at intermediate and high energies is not well understood .",
    "it is clear that clusters do not stem from a break - up of the initial target and projectile nuclei but have to be formed newly towards the end of the fireball evolution .",
    "however , it is not a priori clear , if the clusters are directly formed at the chemical freeze - out , e.g. from a grand canonical thermal ensemble @xcite , or if the formation of the clusters happens at the kinetic surface by coalescence of individual nucleons @xcite . while one may argue that lightly bound clusters ( e.g deuteron has a binding energy of only a few mev ) may either not be formed at the chemical freeze - out due to the large temperature and may be easily destroyed ( if formed earlier ) in the kinetic stage , the predictions of clusters multiplicities within the statistical approach provide a good description of the measured data . on the other hand coalescence of neutrons and protons to deuterons after the kinetic freeze - out is certainly another possible process and allows to describe the experimental data equally well @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose to use the fluctuations of the deuteron number to distinguish between the two production / formation mechanisms .",
    "these studies have become possible due to the increased experimental possibilities available at rhic bes .",
    "to elucidate the idea we compare three scenarios : i ) direct deuteron production from a grand canonical thermal ensemble at the chemical freeze - out . here ,",
    "all fluctuations are poissonian and the scaled moments of the deuteron distribution @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are all unity . in addition , there is no correlation between the proton and the deuteron number .",
    "ii ) only production of nucleons from the grand canonical thermal ensemble at the chemical freeze - out is assumed , while deuterons are formed by coalescence after the kinetic freeze - out . in this case",
    "we consider two variations of the coalescence prescription : ii.a ) the initial number of protons fluctuates according to a poisson distribution , while the number of deuterons depends on the squared proton density .",
    "ii.b ) both proton and neutron fluctuations are poissonian and the number of deuterons is proportional to their product . as a result in both coalescence scenarios the deuteron number will not fluctuate according to a poisson distribution and all higher moments will show strong deviations from their poisson values .",
    "next we closer explain both used coalescence models .      to quantify the fluctuations in scenario ii.a ) we follow the standard coalescence approach , i.e. deuterons are formed after the kinetic freeze - out in each event with a probability proportional to the squared number of all initially produced protons @xcite , i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the coalescence parameter , which may depend on the center - of - mass energy . in this model",
    "we actually make the ( standard ) assumption that neutron yield is directly correlated with the proton yield in that event .",
    "( this assumption will be relaxed in the other model . )",
    "the strength of the event - by - event proton - neutron correlation can be extracted from experimental measurements , see also appendix .",
    "we emphasize that the predicted fluctuation signal should be studied in a fixed volume , e.g. using tight centrality cuts to avoid volume fluctuations .    the number of deuterons @xmath6 in a given reaction with fixed initial proton number @xmath7 is then given by a poisson distribution @xmath8 summing over the initial proton numbers distributed according to @xmath9 then leads to the final deuteron number fluctuations based on the initial proton number fluctuations as @xmath10 recall that @xmath9 is poissonian and the initial proton number can be obtained as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mean _ observed _ proton number .",
    "the coalescence model presented in previous subsection is extreme in its assumption that neutron and proton fluctuations are strongly correlated . in order to make robust predictions for the moments of the deuteron number distribution we will relax the assumption",
    "completely and consider the model with independent proton and neutron fluctuations .",
    "the initial proton ( neutron ) number @xmath7(@xmath13 ) fluctuates again according to poisson distribution and the deuteron formation probability is proportional to the product of nucleon multiplicities , i.e. @xmath14 the coalescence parameter @xmath5 depends again only on the collision energy .",
    "the initial neutron number @xmath13 fluctuates according to a poisson distribution with the same mean number as the initial proton number .",
    "the number of deuterons in events with given number of nucleons is given by the poisson distribution @xmath15 the deuteron number distribution is then obtained by summing up over the initial proton and neutron number distributions @xmath16",
    "it has been shown recently that if deuteron production scales with the squared proton number ( model a ) then higher scaled moments of the observed proton number fluctuations agree qualitatively with the data from rhic beam energy scan program @xcite .",
    "unfortunetely , this feature does not survive in model b. nevertheless , we also use it in our calculation .",
    "the real situation is perhaps somewhere in between the two used models and by showing that our signal is clearly visible in both cases we will prove its robustness .",
    "the essential model parameter is the coalescence parameter @xmath5 which we fix to obtain the correct mean deuteron multiplicity at midrapidity for each energy . while the data on proton multiplicities at midrapidity are abundant , the data on deuterons are not available for all the examined energies .",
    "the available data are however well reproduced by the thermal model .",
    "deuteron to proton ratio @xmath17 can be thus parametrized as : @xmath18^{-1.55 } + 0.0036\\ , .\\ ] ] the observed proton and parametrized deuteron multiplicites are well reproduced in our model .",
    "we summarize the model parameter @xmath5 and results for the mean values of proton and deuteron multiplicities for various collision energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : input ] .",
    "model parameter @xmath5 for model a ( black squares ) and resulting proton ( in blue ) and deuteron ( in red ) multiplicities as function of energy .",
    "the resulting deuteron multiplicity is compared to the thermal fit ( red line ) input to our model.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    plotted are values for model a. the difference to model b is so small that if it was also plotted the data points would practically overlap .",
    "fluctuation of the deuteron number for au+au collisions at 2.6 gev beam energy in comparison to the poisson distribution .",
    "the parameters of the distributions are for model a : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; model b : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for illustration , fig .",
    "[ fig : deut ] shows the distributions of deuteron number for au+au collisions at 2.6 gev beam energy in comparison to the poisson distribution .",
    "here one clearly observes that coalescence leads to skewed distributions with a shift to higher values , as expected from the non - linear formation probability .",
    "the scaled higher moments : the variance @xmath25 , the skewness @xmath2 and the kurtosis @xmath3 all differ significantly from the poisson expectation of unity .",
    "the departure from poissonian distribution is larger if proton and neutron number fluctuate together ( model a ) , but also independent proton and neutron fluctuations ( model b ) lead to clearly non - poissonian shape .",
    "next we explore the energy dependence of the moments of the deuteron distribution and compare to the poisson expectations .",
    "figures  [ fig : mom ] and [ fig : mom2 ]     the energy dependence of the moments @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 of the deuteron distribution obtained from model a compared to the poisson expectation , scaledwidth=50.0% ]     the energy dependence of the moments @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 of the deuteron distribution in the coalescence model assuming indepenedent proton and neutron fluctuations ( model b ) compared to the poisson expectation.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    show the scaled moments @xmath25 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 as functions of collision energy for models a and b , respectively . we observe a clear deviation from the poisson expectation for all the higher moments .",
    "the deviation is very strong at low energies , where both coalescence parameter @xmath5 and the mean proton and neutron numbers are large , which results in sizeable fluctuations of the mean of poissonian deuteron number distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ coal ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ e : lamb ] ) .",
    "this leads to even larger fluctuations of the deuteron number .",
    "the effect could be possibly observed for energies up to about 5 gev in all the moments and even up to higher energies in kurtosis only .    removing the correlation between initial proton and neutron fluctuations",
    "clearly weakens the effect , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom2 ] .",
    "the scaled moments attain approximately one half of the values obtained for neutron number coupled to the proton number .",
    "we can still conclude , however , that we should be able to observe the deviation of the moments of the deuteron multiplicity distribution in case of coalescence regardless of the strength of the correlation of nucleon fluctuations .",
    "additional information about the degree of this correlation can be provided by proton - deuteron multiplicity correlations , as shown in the appendix .",
    "in the light of the ongoing debate about the origin of the deuterons we propose to measure data on fluctuations of deuterons . employing standard approach and using the deuteron formation probability as proportional to the square of the nucleon yield we obtain strongly non - poissionian distribution of the deuteron yield .",
    "exact shape of deuteron distribution depends on whether proton and neutron yield are correlated or not .",
    "we tested both extremes  i.e .",
    ", strongly correlated and completely independent  and the departure from poissonian is always large .",
    "this allows to disentangle the direct grand canonical production of deuterons ( and other clusters ) from the formation of deuterons by coalescence .    for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that the initial proton number follows a poisson distribution .",
    "this is fine for measurements with small acceptance .",
    "if baryon number is exactly conserved within the acceptance window , then the initial proton number should follow binomial distribution .",
    "nevertheless , all our results should not change qualitatively .",
    "note also , that direct comparison with experimental data will also have to include the fluctuations of volume",
    ".    our predictions are testable by the current experiments at the rhic - bes and later by fair .",
    "we thank igor mishustin for enlightening discussions .",
    "the computational resources were provided by the loewe center for scientific computing ( loewe - csc ) of the university of frankfurt , germany .",
    "this work was financially supported by the helmholtz international center for fair ( hic for fair ) within the hessian loewe initiative .",

    "zf thanks the daad for the support during the stay at the frankfurt institute for advanced studies .",
    "another observable which distinguishes thermal grand - canonical production and cluster production via coalescence is the correlation of proton and deuteron multiplicities . in the grand - canonical statistical approach",
    "the proton and deuteron multiplicities both fluctuate independently according to the poisson distribution .",
    "however , in the coalescence scenario the deuteron fluctuations are connected to the initial proton and/or neutron number and thus to the observed nucleon number fluctuations , as well .",
    "this leads to positive correlation between proton and deuteron multiplicities . on the other hand at a fixed initial proton number @xmath7 a larger deuteron multiplicity @xmath6 results in a smaller final proton number @xmath28 , which introduces anticorrelation between @xmath12 and @xmath6 .    to explore to what degree the proton and deuteron multiplicities",
    "are correlated we evaluate the correlation coefficient @xmath29 defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31(@xmath32 ) and @xmath33(@xmath34 ) are the mean value and width of proton ( deuteron ) multiplicity distribution .",
    "the mean value and the width for both protons and deuterons are calculated using the distributions we derived earlier .",
    "now we have to distinguish between the two coalescence models we introduced .",
    "first , we explore model a with strongly correlated initial proton and neutron fluctuations . to calculate the correlation coefficient consistenly within this approach we sum over all possible @xmath35 states : @xmath36     energy dependence of the correlation coefficients between proton number and deuteron number in the case of coalescence with strongly correlated proton and neutron fluctuations ( model a ) and in the case of coalescence with independent proton and neutron fluctuations ( model b).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] the correlation paramater @xmath37 is shown as function of energy .",
    "the proton and deuteron multiplicity are positively correlated .",
    "the correlation is stronger for lower energies , where the coalescence parameter is larger .",
    "an interesting feature of the results is the decrease of the correlation for the lowest energies .",
    "this effect is caused by the wide deuteron distribution which emphasizes the extreme low and high values of deuteron number leading to stronger anticorrelation .",
    "overall correlation is thus reduced .",
    "next we will investigate the correlations in the coalescence model with independent initial nucleon fluctuations ( model b ) . in this case , we calcute the correlation coefficient by summing over all possible @xmath38 states : @xmath39 the correlation parameter @xmath37 calculated assuming independent proton and neutron fluctuations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] as function of energy and compared with the result of model a. there is a marked difference between the two models .",
    "the proton and deuteron multiplicities are now anticorrelated .",
    "the anticorrelation is caused by an interplay of two effects .",
    "firstly , the number of deuterons now depends only linearly on the number of protons , as compared to the squared proton yield in model a. thus , the correlation is weaker . on the other hand ,",
    "the anticorrelation is reinforced by the neutrons fluctuating independently , that cause an increase of higher deuteron production when the proton yield is lower , but neutron yield is high and vice - versa .",
    "the proton - deuteron multiplicity correlation measurement yields very different results for the two coalescence scenarios .",
    "however , in both scenarios we see a clear deviation from a poisson - like uncorrelated thermal proton and deuteron production .",
    "we propose this measurement as complementary to the moments of the deuteron distribution that could possibly help to shed some light on the degree of correlation in the nucleon production .",
