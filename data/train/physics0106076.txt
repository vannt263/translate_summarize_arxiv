    "curved flame propagation is one of the most important and difficult issues in the combustion theory . despite considerable efforts , its closed theoretical description is still lacking .",

    "this estimate for the curvature radius can be obtained from the linear theory of the ld - instability @xcite , where it corresponds to the cutoff wavelength for the front perturbations ; it is also confirmed by 2d numerical experiments on the flame dynamics @xcite .    in essential ,",
    "difficulties encountered in investigation of the nonlinear development of the ld - instability are twofold :    \\1 ) perturbation analysis of the nonlinearity of flame dynamics with arbitrary gas expansion is generally inadequate .",

    "\\2 ) finite vorticity production in the flame implies that the flow dynamics downstream , and therefore the flame front dynamics itself , is essentially nonlocal .",
    "the latter means that the non - locality of equations governing flame propagation is more complex than that encountered in the linear theory and described by the landau - darrieus operator .    only in the case of small gas expansion",
    "can the problem be treated both perturbatively and locally , since then the amplitudes of perturbations remain small compared to their wavelengths at all stages of development of the ld - instability @xcite , and the flow is potential both up- and downstream in the lowest order in @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ratio of the fuel density and the density of the burnt matter . in this approximation ,",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the front perturbations is described by the well - known sivashinsky equation @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics of flames with finite gas expansion has been the subject of a number of papers some of which are briefly considered here as the characteristic examples of dealing with the difficulties mentioned above .",
    "to render the problem tractable , certain simplifying assumptions has been introduced by various authors in attempt to weaken or even get rid of one of the two above features inherent to the nonlinear flame dynamics . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the vorticity production in the flame is completely neglected [ see the point 2 ) above ] .",
    "the mass conservation and the constant normal flame velocity are taken as the conditions governing flame dynamics .",
    "the problem is reduced thereby to the well - known electrodynamic problem of determining the single layer potential with constant charge distribution proportional to the gas expansion . however , neglecting the vorticity downstream breaks the continuity of tangential velocity components as well as the constant jump of pressure across the flame .",
    "this model thus violates the basic conservation laws to be satisfied across the flame front .",
    "note that the number of neglected degrees of freedom ( three in the 3-dimensional case ) just corresponds to the number of broken conservation laws ( two tangential velocity components and the scalar pressure ) .",
    "in contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite , an attempt is made to take into account the vorticity production in stationary flames , under the assumption of weak nonlinearity [ see the point 1 ) above ] . from the mathematical point of view , however , the assumptions of weak nonlinearity and stationarity contradict each other . using them simultaneously turns out to be inconsistent except for the case of small gas expansion .",

( 33 ) , turns out to be velocity - dependent already for zero thickness flames , while according to the well - known exact result @xcite this jump is constant along the flame front , and is equal to @xmath30    it should be stressed that the above - mentioned inconsistency resides in the equations of motion themselves ; it is inherent , therefore , to the flame propagation in tubes as well as to unbounded flames . indeed , even in the case of very narrow tubes , numerical experiments on flames with @xmath31 give values of about @xmath32 for the slope @xcite .    finally , we mention ref .",
    "@xcite , where a non - stationary equation describing the interaction of perturbations at the early stage of development of ld instability is obtained at the second order of nonlinearity , under a certain model assumption concerning the structure of downstream flow .",
    "namely , it is assumed that there exists a _",
    "relation between the pressure field and the potential mode of the velocity downstream ( expressed by the bernoulli equation ) .",
    "however , as we mentioned in 2 ) , the flow dynamics downstream is essentially nonlocal , in particular , the pressure field is expressed through the velocity field by an integral relation , its kernel being an appropriate green function of the laplace operator . from the work @xcite",
    ", one can see once again that the perturbative treatment of nonlinearities is not applicable to the stationary flames with arbitrary @xmath33 since , at the first order , the time derivatives of the front position are linearly related to its space derivatives through eq .",
    "( [ rel4 ] ) , stationary form of the non - stationary zhdanov - trubnikov equation depends on the way this relation is used before the time derivatives are omitted .",
    "transition to the stationary regime in this equation is therefore ambiguous .    in view of what has been said ,",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the stationary flames can only be treated consistently in the framework of the small @xmath26 expansion .",
    "thus , the problem of describing the stationary flames , and more generally , non - stationary flames in the fully developed nonlinear regime , can be formulated as the problem of deriving an expansion of unknown exact equation , governing flame dynamics , in powers of @xmath34    the purpose of the present paper is to show that in the stationary case , such an expansion can indeed be developed beyond the second order , the order of validity of the sivashinsky equation .",

    "since our main concern is the influence of finite gas expansion on the flame structure , we will assume in what follows that the fluid is an ideal gas with constant thermal conduction and constant specific heat .",
    "the ratio of the heat and mass diffusivities ( the lewis number ) is taken to be unity .",
    "for definiteness , we consider flame propagation in a tube of arbitrary width with ideally slip adiabatic walls . under the assumption that development of the ld instability ends up with the formation of a steady flame configuration",
    ", we go over to the reference frame of the stationary flame .",
    "let the cartesian coordinates @xmath35 be chosen so that @xmath11-axis is parallel to the tube walls , @xmath36 being in the fresh fuel .",
    "it will be convenient to introduce the following dimensionless variables @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the velocity of a plane flame front , @xmath40 is the initial pressure in the fuel far ahead of the flame front , and @xmath41 is some characteristic length of the problem ( e.g. , the cut - off wavelength ) .",
    "the fluid density will be normalized on the fuel density @xmath42 as always , we assume that the process of flame propagation is nearly isobaric .",
    "then the velocity and pressure fields obey the following equations in the bulk @xmath43",
    "@xmath44 @xmath45    the above flow equations are complemented by the following conservation laws to be satisfied across the flame front @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where the flame front position is given by @xmath49 the subscripts `` @xmath50 '' and `` @xmath51 '' mean that the corresponding quantity should be evaluated at @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively , and @xmath54    finally , the normal velocity of the fuel at the flame front is unity , which is expressed in the form of the evolution equation @xmath55 equations ( [ conserv1])([evolution ] ) are written for zero thickness flames .",
    "these are of primary interest , since in the majority of cases the thickness of the flame front is small compared with the fluid - dynamical scale of the problem .",
    "formal generalization to the case of small but nonzero thickness is straightforward and will be done in sec .",
    "[ account ] .    in principle , the system of equations ( [ flow1 ] )  ( [ evolution ] ) completely determines stationary flame configuration as well as the flows upstream and downstream . to derive an equation for the flame front function @xmath56 one has to find solution of the bulk equations ( [ flow1 ] )  ( [ flow3 ] ) for the fuel and combustion products with appropriate boundary conditions on the walls , subject to the conservation laws ( [ conserv1 ] )  ( [ conserv3 ] ) which are a kind of boundary conditions on the flame front .",
    "the requirement that the obtained solution satisfies eq .",

    "things become more complicated downstream . there",

    "determination of the @xmath69-dependence alone of the functions involved is therefore sufficient for the purpose of description of the flame front structure .    in what follows , it will be convenient to introduce separate designations for the up- and downstream velocity and pressure fields .",
    "namely , they will be distinguished by the _ super_scripts @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively . then , setting @xmath49 equations  ( [ solup2 ] ) , ( [ solup3 ] ) , ( [ model ] ) , ( [ soldown2 ] ) , and ( [ flowdownnew ] ) , together with the conservation laws ( [ conserv1 ] )  ( [ conserv3 ] ) and the evolution equation ( [ evolution ] ) , can be rewritten identically as follows @xmath98    suppose we have found a solution @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 etc . of the set of equations in the large brackets in ( @xmath102 ) . then , in particular , these equations are satisfied for @xmath103 on the other hand , since no operation involving @xmath71 appears in these equations , the function @xmath57 is one and the same for all solutions .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath57 is @xmath71-independent , it is convenient to work with the particular solution in which all the other functions are also @xmath71-independent , and to omit the large brackets in ( @xmath102 ) . therefore , we replace the above set of equations by the following @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the @xmath71-independent counterparts of the flow variables @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively , and @xmath109 the fact that now the function @xmath57 does not enter the arguments of these variables allows us to avoid expanding them in powers of @xmath95 ( employed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "in fact , such an expansion is irrelevant to the issue whatever regime ( stationary or not ) is considered , since all the equations governing flame propagation are invariant with respect to the space translations , and therefore , all terms containing powers of undifferentiated @xmath95 should appear in invariant combinations in the final equation for @xmath19 on the other hand , in view of the above - mentioned translation invariance , the function @xmath95 itself does not need to be small even if the front is only weakly curved ( e.g. , at the early stage of development of the ld - instability ) .",
