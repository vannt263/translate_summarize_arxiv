    "the first grigorchuk group @xmath0 appeared in  @xcite in the early 1980 s , as an example of a finitely generated , infinite , torsion group .",
    "it was soon shown to be just - infinite , and to have intermediate word growth  @xcite , answering milnor s question  @xcite . to this date",
    "it remains the fundamental example of such a group .",
    "the usual description of @xmath0 is as a `` group generated by automata '' . as such",
    ", it acts on a binary rooted tree , and its elements are described by finite - state transducer automata .",
    "one may close @xmath0 using the topology of the automorphism group of the binary rooted tree ; sunic and grigorchuk asked in 2007 , in cardiff , whether the closure @xmath1 of @xmath0 contained other finite - state transducer automata , and in particular other with only one non - trivial cycle ( so - called `` bounded automata '' ) .    in answering that question , the second author discovered a `` twisted '' version @xmath2 of @xmath0 , and the purpose of the present paper is to study some of its algebraic properties . in summary",
    ", @xmath2 also acts on the infinite binary tree , and shares many properties with @xmath0 :    * @xmath2 is torsion , just - infinite , and has the same closure as @xmath0 in the group of automorphisms of the tree ; * @xmath2 has a finite endomorphic presentation @xmath3 where @xmath4,[{\\delta},{\\gamma}^a{\\beta}],[{\\delta},({\\gamma}^a{\\beta})^{\\gamma}],[{\\gamma}^a{\\beta},{\\gamma}{\\beta}^a]\\}$ ] and @xmath5 is the endomorphism of the free group on @xmath6 induced by @xmath7 see theorem  [ thm : presentation ] .",
    "moreover , its relators are independent in @xmath8 which , qua @xmath9$]-module , is freely generated by @xmath10 , see theorem  [ thm : schur ] ; * @xmath2 has bounded width ; more precisely , if @xmath11 denote its lower central series , then @xmath12 is an elementary abelian @xmath13-group of rank @xmath13 if @xmath14 for some @xmath15 , and of rank @xmath16 otherwise , see corollary  [ cor : lcs ] ; * @xmath2 and @xmath0 are not isomorphic ; @xmath0 does not have the congruence property , and more precisely its congruence kernel is isomorphic to @xmath17 $ ] as a profinite @xmath18-module .",
    "this paper is related to  @xcite which studies more systematically the congruence problem for groups generated by automata .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to assemble , in a systematic manner , the various tools and techniques used to study a new example of group generated by automata .",
    "we believe that the very computational nature of these groups lends itself to computer calculations , and we make liberal use of gap  @xcite to complete several steps .",
    "we use the knuth - bendix procedure implemented in the package kbmag  @xcite to improve a presentation of our group .",
    "many proofs reduce to computations in finite permutation groups ; they are easily performed in gap .",
    "some other proofs are more involved , often relying on an induction process .",
    "the induction basis boils down to verifications in nilpotent quotients of l - presented groups and happily , such quotients are now efficiently implemented in the package nql  @xcite .",
    "we insist however that these computations could very well have been done , and written down , by hand , at the cost of trebling the length of this paper ; and that the statements of this paper are true and not empirical facts .",
    "the methods presented here can all be applied with only slight modifications to the grigorchuk group , or to other groups generated by automata , yet to come under the spotlight .",
