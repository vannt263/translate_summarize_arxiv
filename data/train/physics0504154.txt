    "in a variety of applications in physics it is important to understand how is the normal hydrogen spectrum modified if at small distances the coulomb law is replaced by a central short - ranged potential .",
    "an important aspect of this problem is the existence of two length scales - the bohr radius of the coulomb field @xmath1 and the range of action of short - range forces @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in hadronic atoms formed by charged particles and antiparticles the large distance coulomb attraction gives its way at short distances to nuclear forces whose range @xmath2 is significantly smaller than @xmath1 @xcite .    in condensed matter physics",
    "a similar problem is that of the energy spectrum of the wannier - mott exciton @xcite .",
    "when in a semiconductor an electron is excited into the conduction band , a bound state with a hole left in the valence band can form .",
    "due to the large dielectric constant of the medium the electron and the hole in the exciton are spatially well - separated .",
    "therefore the electron - hole interaction is a coulomb attraction modified at short distances . in this context",
    "@xmath1 can exceed many times @xmath2 which is of the order of the hydrogen bohr radius .",
    "zeldovich was apparently the first to recognize that in the limit @xmath3 the spectrum of the distorted coulomb problem is peculiar @xcite .",
    "since the centrifugal barrier decreases the probability of particle penetration in the region of small distances @xmath4 , the effect of the short - range potential is strongest for the states of zero angular momentum . in this case",
    "the radial motion of a particle of mass @xmath5 and energy @xmath6 in a central potential @xmath7 is described by the one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xcite@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radial wave function .",
    "zeldovich chose @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 otherwise and demonstrated that as long as the short - range potential @xmath13 is not resonant , its effect is weak .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath13 has a low - energy scattering resonance , a drastic reconstruction of the spectrum takes place . using the example of the square well of depth @xmath14 he stated that as the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath15 increases , the spectrum of the problem @xmath16 evolves in a fashion resembling a sharp decreasing staircase .",
    "the steps are located at critical values of @xmath17 at which bound states occur in @xmath13 _ only_. as @xmath17 goes through the first threshold , the coulomb levels @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) quickly fall to @xmath20 while the ground state @xmath21 rapidly drops downward . the relative width of the region where the spectrum reconstruction takes place , @xmath22 , is narrow , and qualitatively the same pattern repeats itself upon passing through every subsequent resonance .",
    "a similar spectral behavior has been found by popov @xcite in his analysis of the dirac equation for an electron in a field of the bare nucleus of charge @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the zeldovich effect has been re - discovered in the spectra of hadronic atoms , and its generality has been demonstrated for any interaction with two widely different spatial scales @xcite .",
    "various aspects of the spectrum reconstruction have been investigated by popov and collaborators @xcite .",
    "their study was motivated by then existing experimental evidence of the large @xmath25-level shift in the proton - antipropton atom which was naturally linked to the zeldovich effect .",
    "later it became clear that the experimental level shifts are small and the interest in the phenomenon declined .",
    "as far as we know , at this time there is no documented experimental evidence of the zeldovich effect .",
    "this is not surprising because the spectrum reconstruction takes place in a narrow range of parameters in the vicinity of low - energy resonances .",
    "however a given experimental system is unlikely to be near resonance . a systematic search for the zeldovich effect would consist in looking for spectral changes in response to tuning of the central part of the potential which is often impossible - the strength of the nuclear force can not be changed in the laboratory .",
    "recently karnakov and popov @xcite pointed out that the zeldovich spectrum reconstruction takes place for a hydrogen atom as a function of the external magnetic field thus providing an example of a system where a systematic search for the effect might be possible .",
    "although the phenomenon is observable in numerical studies , direct experimental evidence is lacking and may only come from astrophysical observations as the pertinent magnetic fields are comparable to those on the surface of a neutron star .",
    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that evolution of the rydberg spectra of ordinary atoms along the periodic table provides direct evidence of the zeldovich effect .",
    "since the condition @xmath3 does not hold in atomic systems , the way the phenomenon manifests itself is less dramatic - we will show that it can be seen as a systematic periodic spectral modulation as a function of the cubic root of atomic number @xmath26 .",
    "it is known that for a highly excited @xmath0 electron of a rydberg atom the effect of polarization of the ionic core is negligible compared to that of the wave function penetration in the central region of the atom @xcite .",
    "therefore the electron dynamics can be adequately described by eq.([se ] ) where the effective central field @xmath7 at large distances is that of a positively charged ion of charge @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "starting from distances of the order of the size of the ionic core @xmath28 the field felt by the electron begins to deviate from the @xmath29 form on - average decreasing , as @xmath30 , to @xmath31 . by increasing @xmath26 along the periodic table nature systematically deepens the inner part of the potential leaving the outer @xmath29 tail intact .",
    "thus by analyzing the rydberg spectra as a function of atomic number @xmath26 it may be possible to correlate them with the binding properties of the ionic core which will constitute evidence of the zeldovich effect .    in atomic physics",
    "the motion of an electron in the field of a residual atomic ion has been studied in the past . approximating the potential of the ionic core by that of the thomas - fermi or thomas - fermi - dirac theories",
    "latter @xcite computed numerically the single - electron term values from @xmath25 to @xmath32 for all atoms .",
    "his @xmath33 spectra as a function of atomic number @xmath26 for largest @xmath34 studied clearly show modulations on a decreasing energy curve .",
    "it is well - known that the large @xmath34 atomic spectra are described by the rydberg formula @xcite@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the quantum defect which in the limit @xmath37 does not depend on @xmath34 .",
    "latter s results imply that the dependence of the quantum defect @xmath36 on @xmath26 has modulations superimposed on an increasing curve .",
    "the @xmath38 dependence has been numerically computed by manson @xcite and by fano , theodosiou and dehmer @xcite who used the hartree - slater model @xcite to approximate the potential of the ionic core of the atom .",
    "although the periodic variations of @xmath38 are strongly obscured by the shell effects ( included in the hartree - slater model ) , fano , theodosiou and dehmer argued that they are there and that there is a correlation between the location of radial nodes of the function @xmath39 from eq.([se ] ) near @xmath2 and the slope of the @xmath38 dependence . in view of the oscillation theorem @xcite the nodal structure of the function @xmath39",
    "is intimately related to the binding properties which suggests that systematic periodic variations of rydberg spectra as function of @xmath26 might be related to the zeldovich effect .    in order to demonstrate that this connection is correct below we compute the upper part of the spectrum of the modified coulomb problem not assuming that @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the staircase reconstruction taking place for @xmath3 and the spectral modulations for @xmath28 are different limiting cases of the same phenomenon - sensitivity to the binding properties of the inner part of the potential which we continue to call the zeldovich effect .",
    "we also compare our results for @xmath38 with available experimental and numerical data to show that the phenomenon is observable .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide a short derivation of the rydberg formula ( [ rydberg ] ) and arrive at the expression for the quantum defect in terms of the dimensionless range of the inner potential and its scattering length .",
    "this general result is further analyzed in the @xmath40 limit and the main features of the zeldovich spectral reconstruction are recovered ( section iia ) . in section iib",
    "we establish a relationship between the zeldovich effect and levinson s theorem of quantum mechanics .",
    "this is followed ( section iic ) by the analysis of the opposite @xmath41 limit where we demonstrate that the zeldovich effect manifests itself in the form of a spectral modulation whose origin still lies in the binding properties of the inner potential @xmath13 .",
    "these general findings are illustrated in section iid where we use the exactly - solvable example of the rectangular well as a model for the inner potential . in section iie",
    "we observe that only a treatment more accurate than semiclassical can capture the zeldovich effect .",
    "section iii focuses on the computation of the systematic quantum defect of the rydberg electron as a function of atomic number @xmath26 .",
    "first ( section iiia ) , for the inner potential having an attractive coulombic singularity at the origin , we derive a semiclassical expression for the quantum defect and show that it is equal to the number of de broglie s half - waves fitting inside the inner potential minus a contribution proportional to @xmath42 . going beyond the semiclassical approximation we also demonstrate that the zeldovich modulation of the quantum defect is a periodic function of the number of de broglie s half - waves fitting inside the ionic core of the atom .",
    "this is followed by an explicit calculation based on latter s model of the ionic core @xcite .",
    "first , the semiclassical quantum defect is calculated as a function of @xmath43 ( section iiib ) .",
    "then ( in section iiic ) a full computation capturing the zeldovich effect is performed .",
    "an important ingredient here is an approximate calculation of the scattering length of the ionic core of the atom .",
    "both the scattering length and the related zeldovich modulation of the quantum defect turned out to be nearly periodic functions of @xmath43 .    in section",
    "iv the results of our systematic calculation are compared with experimental and numerical data .",
    "first , we observe that the bulk of the quantum defect values is well - captured semiclassically",
    ". then ( section iva ) we demonstrate that the gross features of the deviation away from semiclassics are due to the effects of the shell structure .",
    "this is done by establishing and demonstrating a correlation between the variation of the radius of the ionic core of the atom and corresponding variation of the quantum defect .",
    "finally , in section ivb a fourier analysis of the quantum defect variation with @xmath43 is conducted which singles out the zeldovich effect . as a by - product",
    "we also find a @xmath43 periodic contribution coming from the shell effects .",
    "we conclude ( section v ) by outlining our main result and directions of future work .",
    "we will be interested in the low energy bound states with the classical turning point being far away from the boundary of the central region , i. e. @xmath44 . then the quickest way to derive the spectrum is via semiclassical arguments derived from those given by migdal @xcite :    for @xmath45 the semiclassical solution to eq.([se ] )",
    "can be written in two equivalent forms : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the momentum . the first representation in eq.([scfunction ] )",
    "is the standard result with the phase of @xmath48 improving on the deficiency of the semiclassical approximation near the classical turning point , while the yet undetermined phase @xmath49 in the second representation in eq.([scfunction ] ) both corrects for the failure of the semiclassical approximation in a coulomb field at distances @xmath50 and accounts for the short - range potential @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath51 the schrdinger equation ( [ se ] ) simplifies to @xmath52 and can be exactly solved : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the order @xmath56 bessel functions of the first and second kind respectively @xcite . the solution ( [ e=3d0function ] )",
    "is a linear combination of the regular @xmath57 and irregular @xmath58 coulomb functions of zero energy , and for the purely coulomb problem , @xmath59 , one has to recover @xmath60 .    for @xmath61",
    "the semiclassical approximation is accurate , and the second representation of eq.([scfunction ] ) yields @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath63 limit of ( [ e=3d0function ] ) is @xmath64 which determines @xmath49 in ( [ scfunction ] ) to be @xmath65 .",
    "it also implies that @xmath66 in ( [ e=3d0function ] ) is the zero - energy phase shift due to the small - distance deviation of the potential from the coulomb form .",
    "the energy spectrum can be found from the requirement that the semiclassical expressions ( [ scfunction ] ) coincide .",
    "combined with @xmath67 this gives the quantization rule @xmath68 where dimensionless parameter @xmath69 measures the range of the short - range forces .",
    "calculating the integral we arrive at eq.([rydberg ] ) with @xmath70 which is the statement of seaton s theorem @xcite relating the quantum defect to the zero - energy phase shift .",
    "the range of applicability of eq.([rydberg ] ) , @xmath71 , follows from the condition @xmath72 which also implies that in order to calculate the quantum defect entering the spectrum ( [ rydberg ] ) , we only need to match ( [ e=3d0function ] ) with its zero energy counterpart at @xmath73 .",
    "we proceed by computing @xmath74_{r\\rightarrow r_{0}+0}$ ] , the logarithmic derivative of the function ( [ e=3d0function ] ) evaluated at the boundary of the inner region : @xmath75 where we used @xmath70 .",
    "the quantum defect @xmath36 is determined by equating ( [ logderivative ] ) to @xmath76_{r\\rightarrow r_{0}-0}$ ] which can be found by solving the @xmath77 schrdinger equation ( [ se ] ) for @xmath73 with @xmath12 : @xmath78 the parameter @xmath79 can be equivalently expressed in terms of the scattering length corresponding to the inner potential _",
    "indeed for motion in a short - range potential the scattering length @xmath80 is defined from the asymptotic @xmath81 behavior @xmath82 of the solution to ( [ zerose ] ) . for a potential well identically vanishing for @xmath83 ,",
    "this is also the exact behavior outside the well with the implication that @xcite@xmath84 then substituting @xmath85 in eq.([logderivative ] ) and using ( [ logderscatteringlength ] ) we arrive at the formula for the quantum defect @xmath86 if the short - distance potential is selected in the form @xmath59 , i. e. we have the ordinary coulomb problem in the whole space , the quantum defect @xmath36 entering the rydberg formula ( [ rydberg ] ) must vanish identically .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that this is indeed the case : the @xmath77 inner @xmath73 solution to ( [ se ] ) , @xmath87 , leads to the expression for the scattering length nullifying the numerator of ( [ qdgeneral ] ) .",
    "this argument defines the zero of the quantum defect and implies that @xmath36 is necessarily positive if for all @xmath88 the inner potential @xmath13 is more attractive than the coulomb potential @xmath89 ; otherwise the quantum defect is negative .",
    "for example , for @xmath90 the quantum defect @xmath91 is a negative monotonically decreasing function of @xmath92 such as @xmath93 for @xmath94 , and @xmath95 in the opposite @xmath96 limit .",
    "the @xmath91 dependence as well as its @xmath96 limit are shown in fig .  1 .      for @xmath94 eq.([qdgeneral ] ) simplifies to a form accumulating the physics of the zeldovich effect : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is euler s constant .",
    "terms of higher order in @xmath92 which for @xmath90 lead to small negative values of the quantum defect are neglected in ( [ qdzeldovichlimit ] ) .",
    "we verified that eq.([qdzeldovichlimit ] ) matches the upper portion of the @xmath33 spectrum which for @xmath3 is known in closed form for any @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we also note that with some effort eq.([qdzeldovichlimit ] ) can be deduced from the expression for the phase shift of the proton - proton scattering given by landau and smorodinskii @xcite : in their formula we have to ( i ) reverse the sign of the bohr radius , ( ii ) take the limit of zero energy , and ( iii ) employ seaton s theorem @xcite @xmath70 .",
    "2 shows the dependence of @xmath99 on @xmath36 given by eq.([qdzeldovichlimit ] ) ; its inverse @xmath100 is a multivalued function consisting of a series of increasing step - like curves sandwiched between nearest non - negative integers .",
    "the slope of @xmath100 is small everywhere except for the vicinity of half - integer @xmath36 .    since typically the central potential @xmath13 is not resonant , @xmath101 in ( [ qdzeldovichlimit ] ) is not small",
    ". then the magnitude of the scattering length is of the order of the size of the inner well , @xmath102 and @xmath103 is significantly larger than the last term in ( [ qdzeldovichlimit ] ) .",
    "this implies that the quantum defect is very close to an integer , @xmath104 , with @xmath105 .",
    "this conclusion is in quantitative agreement with the results of perturbation theory in @xmath106 when the deviation from the bohr hydrogen formula is small @xcite .",
    "it is applicable to an attractive non - resonant well of arbitrary strength ; for weak @xmath13 which can not support a bound state we have @xmath107 @xcite represented by the leftmost intersection in fig .  2 .",
    "we also note that the spectrum is exactly hydrogenic if the scattering length is zero which can be viewed as an analog of the ramsauer effect @xcite : in the present context it refers to a resonant phenomenon when the distortion of the coulomb potential at small distances is invisible to the low - energy bound ( or incident ) particle .    exactly at half - integer @xmath36",
    "the scattering length is negative with the magnitude @xmath108 significantly exceeding the size of the central region @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that the slope of the @xmath100 dependence is largest when @xmath13 itself is almost resonant so that it supports a low - energy _ virtual _ state . at the point of the steepest slope",
    "we also have @xmath109_{r = r_{0}}\\propto h_{s}\\simeq(x_{0}^{2}/2)\\ln(2/\\gamma x_{0})\\ll1 $ ] .",
    "since this is practically zero , one can equivalently say that the slope of the @xmath100 dependence is largest when the antinode of the function @xmath39 in eq.([se ] ) occurs at the boundary of the inner region @xmath2 .",
    "this criterion resembles that given by fano , theodosiou and dehmer @xcite for the dependence of the quantum defect @xmath36 on atomic number @xmath26 .",
    "we note however , that for a rydberg atom the size of the residual ion does not satisfy the condition @xmath3 ; this issue is further addressed below .",
    "if for all @xmath4 the central well is attractive , its effect can be quantified by a single dimensionless coupling constant @xmath110 where @xmath111 has a meaning of the characteristic depth of the well .",
    "then the inverse scattering length @xmath112 is known to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath17 @xcite - an @xmath80 dependence shown in fig .",
    "3 in gray scale is typical and may help illustrate the argument given below .",
    "the step - like features of the function @xmath100 are amplified in the @xmath113 dependence . indeed , for @xmath114 the scattering length @xmath80 is very small and negative .",
    "then the line of constant @xmath99 in fig .  2 lies at very large negative values , the quantum defect satisfies @xmath115 , and the deviation from the normal hydrogen spectrum is small .",
    "as the well deepens , the coupling constant @xmath17 increases , the scattering length becomes more negative and the horizontal line of constant @xmath99 moves upward .",
    "however as long as the well remains non - resonant , the quantum defect @xmath36 will only grow very little .",
    "the strongest increase of @xmath113 in response to deepening of the well ( and thus the largest deviation from the bohr hydrogen formula ) occurs when the scattering length reaches a very large negative value @xmath116 . for @xmath94",
    "this takes place very close to a threshold value of the coupling constant @xmath17 when the first bound state is about to appear in @xmath13 .",
    "the relative width of the reconstruction region @xmath117 centered around @xmath118 thus can be estimated from the scaling behavior of the scattering length near the threshold @xmath119 and the condition @xmath120 .",
    "this leads to the original result of zeldovich @xcite @xmath121 .    as the coupling constant @xmath17 increases through the first binding threshold , the inverse scattering length changes sign , and the line of constant @xmath99 in fig .",
    "2 enters the region of positive values . after passing through the reconstruction region , the positive scattering length decreases in magnitude , for @xmath122",
    "the quantum defect is close to unity , @xmath123 , and the deviation from the normal hydrogen spectrum is again small . in the region",
    "@xmath124 the scattering length does not vary strongly with the depth of the well , and one can say that the slope of the @xmath113 dependence will be minimal when the node of the function @xmath39 in eq.([se ] ) is near the boundary of the central region @xmath2 which parallels the criterion of fano , theodosiou and dehmer @xcite . upon further increase of the coupling constant @xmath17",
    ", the scattering length gets smaller and the line of constant @xmath99 in fig .",
    "1 enters the region of very large positive values becoming infinite at @xmath125 .    to summarize , as @xmath126 goes through one complete cycle decreasing from zero , passing through the binding resonance , and then approaching zero from above , the quantum defect @xmath113 increases from zero to unity in a staircase fashion : it is mostly zero or unity except for the narrow region @xmath22 , @xmath127 near the first binding threshold of @xmath13 .",
    "combined with the rydberg formula ( [ rydberg ] ) this implies that the coulomb levels @xmath18 quickly fall to @xmath20 which constitutes the essence of the zeldovich effect @xcite .    as the coupling constant @xmath17 continues to increase away from @xmath128 , the next cycle , @xmath129 , begins and qualitatively same pattern repeats itself .",
    "this remains true for every subsequent cycle with @xmath113 sandwiched between nearest integers .",
    "overall the quantum defect is an increasing function of @xmath17 having the form of a staircase with practically integer plateaus and sharp steps located at half - integer @xmath36 .",
    "the steps correspond to the presence of the low - energy scattering resonances in @xmath13 .    to illustrate this behavior we choose the inner potential in the form of a rectangular well of depth @xmath14 whose scattering length is given by @xmath130 with dimensionless parameter @xmath131 quantifying the depth of the well .",
    "the scattering length diverges at odd values of @xmath132 which correspond to consecutive occurrences of bound states in the well ; the respective dependence of @xmath133 on @xmath132 is shown in fig .  3 in gray scale .",
    "we also plot the dependences of the quantum defect @xmath36 on @xmath132 found from the general expression ( [ qdgeneral ] ) for a series of representative @xmath92 .",
    "the analysis based on eq.([qdzeldovichlimit ] ) is illustrated by the @xmath134 and @xmath135 curves ; the latter corresponds to the case of the proton - antiproton atom @xcite .",
    "these dependences have the form of staircases with nearly integer plateaus ; the steepness of the steps where the quantum defect varies by unity and the flatness of the plateaus increase as @xmath92 gets smaller .",
    "an inspection reveals that the points of maximal slope of @xmath136 somewhat precede the scattering resonances in accordance with the analysis given above .",
    "this is seen most clearly for the @xmath137 step of the @xmath135 curve .",
    "2 of zeldovich s work @xcite has this feature as well . from a practical standpoint the steps",
    "can be considered to coincide with the binding resonances of the well .",
    "the relative width of the reconstruction region @xmath138 can be estimated as @xmath139 . since the threshold values @xmath132 grow linearly with the number of bound states , then for fixed @xmath92 the steepness of the steps increases with @xmath132 as can be seen in fig .",
    "this is merely the consequence of the sharpening of the binding resonances .",
    "similarly the flatness of the plateaus improves as @xmath132 increases , and the points of least slope of the @xmath136 dependence asymptotically approach even values of @xmath132 .",
    "this is where the node of the function @xmath39 in eq.([se ] ) coincides with the boundary of the central region , @xmath140 .",
    "finally we note that the quantum defect takes on exactly integer values whenever the scattering length vanishes .",
    "there is a deep parallel between the zeldovich reconstruction of the upper @xmath141 part of the coulomb spectrum in the @xmath3 limit and the low - energy scattering by a short - range potential well . for a particle of energy @xmath142",
    "whose wave vector @xmath143 is small in magnitude , @xmath144 , scattered by the short - range potential @xmath13 vanishing for @xmath83 the scattering length @xmath80 can be defined @xcite through the @xmath145 limit of the relationship @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the phase shift .",
    "employing seaton s theorem @xcite @xmath70 relating the quantum defect to the zero - energy phase shift it is straightforward to realize that eqs.([qdzeldovichlimit ] ) and ( [ phaseshift ] ) are direct analogs .",
    "the coulomb field is characterized by its own length scale , the bohr radius @xmath1 .",
    "its free particle counterpart entering eq.([phaseshift ] ) is the de broglie wavelength @xmath148 .",
    "the range of applicability of eq.([qdzeldovichlimit ] ) @xmath3 parallels the low - energy condition @xmath144 necessary for eq.([phaseshift ] ) to hold .",
    "the analysis which led to the explanation of the zeldovich effect can be repeated for eq.([phaseshift ] ) with the conclusion that the phase shift @xmath147 as a function of the dimensionless depth @xmath17 of the scattering well has the form of a sharp increasing staircase whose plateaus practically coincide with @xmath149 .",
    "the steps where the phase shift changes by @xmath150 are very narrow , @xmath151 , and the points of steepest slope are located at @xmath152 . in the limit @xmath145",
    "the staircase becomes perfect .",
    "this can be recognized as levinson s theorem @xcite relating the number of bound states in a well with the zero - energy scattering phase shift .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath3 the zeldovich effect expressed in terms of the zero - energy phase shift @xmath66 is the coulombic cousin of levinson s theorem @xcite .",
    "a special case of this correspondence , the ramsauer - like recovery of the normal hydrogen spectrum for @xmath125 , was already mentioned earlier . in the limit",
    "@xmath153 zeldovich s staircase becomes perfect and identical to levinson s staircase .",
    "this can be understood as a result of taking the neutral limit , @xmath154 , when the coulomb part of the binding potential @xmath7 in ( [ se ] ) vanishes . from this viewpoint ,",
    "levinson s theorem is a consequence of the zeldovich effect . to emphasize the connection to levinson s theorem , in fig .",
    "3 we additionally show the zero - energy phase shift @xmath70 .",
    "3 also demonstrates that as @xmath92 increases , the staircase @xmath136 dependence with well - defined steps and plateaus evolves into an increasing function with modulations : the `` plateaus '' develop noticeable slope and the `` steps '' acquire a width .",
    "moreover for sufficiently large @xmath155 the staircase - like appearance seems to emerge only for a sufficiently deep well , i. e. large @xmath132 .",
    "another feature is the presence of a negative offset which is a growing function of @xmath92 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for @xmath90 the quantum defect is a monotonically decreasing negative function of @xmath92 as shown in fig .  1 .      in the @xmath96 limit eq.([qdgeneral ] ) simplifies to the form @xmath157 allowing model - independent treatment . the analysis of eq.([qdatomiclimit ] ) is convenient to conduct in terms of the reduced quantum defect @xmath158 whose zero gives the @xmath96 asymptotic of @xmath36 for @xmath90 .",
    "eq.([qdatomiclimit ] ) can be investigated in a manner analogous to that of eq.([qdzeldovichlimit ] ) ; a brief summary is given below .",
    "4 shows the dependence of @xmath133 on @xmath158 given by eq.([qdatomiclimit ] ) ; its inverse @xmath159 is a multivalued function consisting of a series of decreasing step - like segments sandwiched between nearest integers .",
    "the magnitude of the slope of @xmath159 is smallest at integer @xmath160 which occurs at binding resonances , @xmath161 , i. e. when the antinode of the function @xmath39 in eq.([se ] ) coincides with the boundary of the inner region @xmath2 . in the vicinity of integer @xmath160",

    "a qualitatively similar behavior of the scattering length of the thomas - fermi atom as a function of @xmath26 has been reported by robinson @xcite ; quantitative differences may be attributed to the assumption @xcite that the thomas - fermi potential vanishes at a distance of the order @xmath218 which is different from our choice of @xmath2 , eqs.([continuity ] ) and ( [ tfrange ] ) .",

    "10 shows that the experimental and numerical variations of the quantum defect are bounded which is consistent with the view that they are due to repetitive physics .",
    "moreover , the systematic modulation due to the zeldovich effect appears to have an amplitude which is several times smaller than those of experimental and numerical data .",
    "this observation implies that it may be possible to understand gross features of the experimental and numerical modulations of the quantum defect as mostly due to the effects of the shell structure .",
    "this viewpoint can be supported by qualitative analysis which rests on the semiclassical result ( [ coulombscqd ] ) .",
    "first , let us anticipate the outcome of incorporating the shell effects into the calculation",
    ". this amounts to replacing the smooth inner potential @xmath13 by one with modulations due to the spatial variation of the electron density reflecting the shell structure .",
    "this replacement will result in a value of the size of the ionic core @xmath2 , eq.([continuity ] ) , generally different from its systematic counterpart .",
    "let us additionally assume that the inner potential @xmath13 with shell effects included is still sufficiently smooth so that a semiclassical treatment is valid . the corresponding quantum defect ( [ coulombscqd ] ) will deviate away from the systematic result due to different values of the range parameter @xmath92 , eq.([x0 ] ) , and the number of de broglie s half - waves , @xmath248 . because the latter involves the integral of @xmath249 from zero to @xmath2 ( see eqs.([action ] ) and ( [ tfaction ] ) ) the modulations above and below the systematics present in @xmath13",
    "are expected to largely cancel each other and the deviation from our results can be mostly attributed to the different size of the ionic core .",
    "this argument implies that the quantum defect is strongly sensitive to the value of the size of ionic core @xmath2 and weakly sensitive to the details of the inner potential @xmath13 . in reality",
    "the inner potential may not be smooth enough for the semiclassial treatment to be quantitatively correct .",
    "therefore we do not expect more than a qualitative insight into the trends of the variations of the quantum defect induced by the shell effects .    the simple rule that emerges can be most easily deduced from fig .  6 by keeping in mind the relationship between the range parameter @xmath92 , eq.([x0 ] ) and the size of the ionic core @xmath250 : deviation in @xmath2 away from systematics leads to the same sign deviation in the quantum defect .",
    "since the size of the ionic core of the rydberg atom has a physical meaning close to that of an ionic radius , to verify the correlation we need a set of ionic radii for singly - charged positive ions as a function of position @xmath26 along the periodic table .",
    "seventy five years ago j. c. slater @xcite gave a very useful , general , empirical set of rules to approximate analytically atomic wave functions for all the elements in any stage of ionization .",
    "the radial part of the single - electron wave function is selected in the form @xmath251 which can be recognized as the large - distance asympotics of a hydrogen - like wave function with an effective quantum number @xmath252 and an effective nuclear charge @xmath253 .",
    "based on the underlying electronic structure , slater s rules assign values of @xmath252 and @xmath254 to the electrons of each shell of an atom or ion , so that a complete set of single - electron wave functions can be constructed .    for a given shell",
    "the maximum of the electron density @xmath255 is located at @xmath256 which formally coincides with the expression for the radius of the corresponding circular orbit in bohr s old theory .",
    "the radius of the maximum density of the outermost shell is expected to correlate with the size of the atom or ion .",
    "specifically , slater defines an ionic radius @xmath257 as a distance at which the electron density becomes 10%  of its maximal value .    using the existing knowledge of electronic configurations",
    "@xcite we applied slater s rules to calculate the ionic radii of singly - charged positive ions . the result is shown in fig .",
    "11 where the elements marking the beginning or an end of more dramatic changes in the ionic radius are labeled . for comparison we also displayed a series of ionic crystal radii @xcite used for predicting and visualizing crystal structures .",
    "crystal ionic radii are based on experimental crystal structure determinations , empirical relationships , and theoretical calculations . as fig .",
    "11 shows , they are in fair agreement with their slater s counterparts .",
    "we hasten to mention that neither slater s nor the crystal ionic radii are expected to coincide with what we define as the size of the ionic core of the rydberg atom , eq.([continuity ] ) .",
    "it seems highly plausible , however , that slater s ionic radii are correlated with the sizes of ionic core of the rydberg atom .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "11 tells us that the average slater s ionic radius slowly grows with @xmath43 in fairly good agreement with our systematic result .",
    "a closer look reveals that our systematic radius appears to be consistently smaller than its slater s counterpart .",
    "if the same relationship would hold between the systematic and ( unknown ) exact sizes of ionic cores of rydberg atoms , then the fact that experimental and numerical quantum defects in figs .  9 and 10 are generally larger than their systematic counterparts would be explained .",
    "the large variation of the slater s ionic radius away from the average trend is due to the effects of the shell structure .",
    "their role in determining the ionic radius can be most easily visualized based on the expression for the radius of the maximum electron density ( [ rmax ] ) which correlates with the ionic radius .",
    "this result emphasizes the following main principles :    \\(i ) as @xmath26 increases , all the @xmath34 levels move down in energy which amounts to replacing @xmath34 by its effective counterpart @xmath258 .",
    "if the electrons are added to an outer shell , the effective nuclear charge @xmath253 seen by each of them gradually increases .",
    "this is because the outer shell electrons are relatively inefficient in shielding the nuclear charge . as a result",
    "the ion slowly contracts .",
    "\\(ii ) as a new outer shell begins to fill , the effect of going into the higher shell outweighs the effect of lowering of an @xmath34 level as @xmath26 increases to @xmath259 .",
    "this corresponds to an abrupt increase of the effective principal quantum number @xmath252 .",
    "moreover , the effective charge @xmath253 seen by the outermost electron drops because now all remaining @xmath260 electrons belong to inner shells thus efficiently screening the nuclear charge .",

    "in going from @xmath261he ( @xmath262 ) , to @xmath263li ( @xmath264 ) the ion size decreases .",
    "as one moves to @xmath265be ( [ he]@xmath266 ) the added electron enters the higher 2@xmath0 shell , and the ionic radius sharply increases .",
    "similar increases take place as one goes from every alkali to the following alkali earth ion .",

    "the sudden change is due to the fact that the outer shell changes from @xmath309 to @xmath308 which can be viewed as a decrease in the effective quantum number @xmath252 .",
    "the subsequent slower increase of the ionic radius is due to the increase of the effective nuclear charge @xmath253 seen by the larger number of @xmath308 electrons .",
    "the same trend is exhibited in the @xmath321zr ( [ kr]@xmath322)@xmath323nb ( [ kr]@xmath324)@xmath284mo ( [ kr]@xmath285 ) sequence .",

    "this behavior can be explained by noticing that in both steps the effective @xmath254 felt by a @xmath342 electron increases ; the increase during the second step is smaller because inner shell @xmath343 electrons are more efficient in screening the nuclear charge than @xmath0 electrons .    while going from @xmath344sr ( [ kr]@xmath345 ) to @xmath346y ( [ kr]@xmath347 ) and to @xmath321zr ( [ kr]@xmath322 ) a decrease of ionic radius follows by an increase .",
    "this happens because the effective @xmath254 felt by an outer @xmath348 electron first increases and then decreases .",
    "the increase of the size of the ion is somewhat smaller than the decrease because two @xmath349 electrons in zr only partially shield two extra units of the nuclear charge .    for the @xmath350eu ( [ xe]@xmath351)@xmath352gd ( [ xe]@xmath353) @xmath354 tb ( [ xe]@xmath355 ) sequence the ionic radius first decreases and then increases back to its initial value",
    "this happens because the @xmath343 electron in gd is less effective in shielding the nuclear charge than the @xmath356 electron in tb ( considered perfect in slater s scheme ) .",
    "one of the less intuitive increases of ionic radius takes place while going from @xmath357ba ( [ xe]@xmath358 ) to @xmath359la ( [ xe]@xmath360 ) . on one hand ,",
    "the effective principal quantum number @xmath252 decreases which according to ( [ rmax ] ) should lower the ionic radius .",
    "however as compared to the @xmath342 electron of ba , the effective @xmath254 seen by one of la s @xmath318 electrons also decreases .",
    "this happens because the inner shell @xmath361 electrons screen the nuclear charge more effectively if the outer shell electrons are in a @xmath343 state ( la ) as compared to an @xmath0 state ( ba ) . as a result",
    "the decrease in @xmath254 outweighs the decrease in @xmath252 thus leading to an increase of the ion size .",
    "a very similar argument explains the reversed decrease of ionic radius taking place as one goes from @xmath362ce ( [ xe]@xmath363 ) ( whose size is identical to that of la ) to @xmath364pr ( [ xe]@xmath365 ) ( identical in size to ba ) . here",
    "the role of the @xmath366 electrons merely reduces to compensating for the increase of the nuclear charge .",
    "the ionic radius does not change as one moves from @xmath359la ( [ xe]@xmath360 ) to @xmath362ce ( [ xe]@xmath363 ) because the increase of nuclear charge is exactly compensated by adding a @xmath366 electron .",
    "the same argument explains the constancy of the ionic radius along most of the lanthanide sequence , @xmath364pr ( [ xe]@xmath365) @xmath350eu ( [ xe]@xmath351 ) , @xmath354 tb ( [ xe]@xmath355) @xmath316yb ( [ xe]@xmath337 ) . the only exception from this trend , @xmath352gd ( [ xe]@xmath353 , has already been discussed .",
    "now when the variations of the slater s ionic radius are understood , we can compare them with experimental and numerical modulations of the quantum defect .",
    "since the numerical data are more extensive than experimental findings , and the agreement between the two is fairly good , in fig .",
    "11 we only show the variation of the numerically evaluated quantum defect @xmath367 .",
    "the inspection of fig .",
    "11 leaves no doubt that the variations of the quantum defect with @xmath43 are correlated with those of the slater s ionic radius - even the minute changes of the latter find their way in the corresponding changes of the former .",
    "there are however two places where it appears there is a disagreement with expectation :    \\(i ) along most of the lanthanide sequence the slater s ionic radius does not change while the variation of the quantum defect decreases .",
    "this can be understood as an artifact of the slater s rules . in reality",
    "the @xmath356 electrons do not perfectly screen the nuclear charge . therefore the effective charge seen by the outer @xmath342 electron increases with @xmath43 and correspondingly the ionic radius should decrease .",
    "then the quantum defect variation should decrease as well which is in correspondence with numerical results .",
    "we also note that the gd dip of the ionic radius is reproduced in the quantum defect variation .",
    "\\(ii ) for the elements past hg , the slater s ionic radius decreases with @xmath43 while the variation of the quantum defect increases .",
    "the reason why it happens is unclear .",
    "it can not be ruled out that here the effects of the shell structure might be so strong that our correlation rule derived from semiclassical arguments breaks down qualitatively .",
    "overall , the analysis of this section makes it certain that the gross features of the quantum defect variation with @xmath43 are due to the effects of the shell structure .",
    "qualitative analysis is of little use in trying to see the zeldovich effect in experimental and numerical data because the zeldovich modulation has an amplitude which is several times smaller than that due to the effects of the shell structure ( see fig .",
    "10 ) . a way to proceed quantitatively",
    "is suggested by the fashion in which the shell and systematic effects are coupled .    inspecting the limiting expression for the zeldovich modulation , eq.([zeloscillation ] ) , it is straightforward to see that after replacing systematic @xmath13 with the one accounting for the shell structure , the amplitude of the zeldovich modulation will become strongly sensitive to the effects of the shell structure because it is determined by the logarithmic derivative of the inner potential @xmath13 and the range parameter @xmath92 . on the other hand , the period of the oscillation is far less sensitive to the effects of the shell structure since it is determined by the number of de broglie s half - waves fitting inside the ionic core of the atom .",
    "this last observation suggests that it might be possible to see the zeldovich effect in the experimental and numerical fourier spectra of the quantum defect variation @xmath367 ( see fig .",
    "10 ) as a peak whose location can be brought in correspondence with the systematic theory . to proceed in this direction , in a range of @xmath43 of length @xmath368",
    "we expand the quantum defect variation into a fourier series @xmath369 where @xmath370 . in order to numerically evaluate the fourier coefficients @xmath371 , the experimental and numerical @xmath243 dependences ( see fig .",
    "10 ) were fitted with a cubic spline which was then sampled equidistantly in @xmath43 to extract the fourier spectrum .",
    "the result for the magnitude of the fourier coefficients @xmath372 as a function of @xmath373 is displayed in fig .",
    "12 as a series of solid dots    which for convenience are connected by straight line segments .",
    "the uncertainty of the location of each dot along the @xmath373 axis , @xmath374 , is the distance between the nearest values of @xmath373 . since the last available experimental quantum defect corresponds to @xmath375bi ( see table 1 ) , for both experimental and numerical data we restricted ourselves to @xmath376 .",
    "the finite values of @xmath377 correspond to the presence of nonzero background in experimental and numerical @xmath243 dependences and are of no interest to us .    for comparison in fig .",
    "12 we also show the fourier spectrum of our systematic calculation which , as expected , has only one peak corresponding to the zeldovich effect .",
    "the position of the peak along the @xmath373 axis can be understood from the large @xmath26 asymptotics of the thomas - fermi action @xmath378 ( [ tfaction ] ) . comparing this with the limiting expression for the zeldovich modulation ( [ zeloscillation ] ) we would expect a peak at @xmath379 .",
    "the peak in fig .",
    "12 is located at a slightly different value of @xmath380 which is due to the fact that the asymptotic behavior @xmath381 becomes numerically accurate only for @xmath43 exceeding @xmath382 .",
    "both the experimental and numerical spectra in fig .",
    "12 have peaks at the same value of @xmath380 which we argue are the signatures of the zeldovich effect .",
    "it is curious that both experimental and numerical spectra have another peak in common located at @xmath383 .",
    "this peak which is about twice as high as that due to the zeldovich effect is natural to relate to the effects of the shell structure .",
    "the existence of this peak translates into the @xmath384 periodicity of the quantum defect variation due to the effects of the shell structure .",
    "this conclusion resembles the @xmath43 periodic oscillation of the ground - state energy of an atom away from the systematic trend @xcite . with uncertainty of the peak location in mind",
    ", one may speculate that our result is a manifestation of the same effect for highly - excited states .",
    "more work is necessary to bring understanding to this issue .",
    "we also repeated the same fourier analysis by choosing the range of @xmath43 to be @xmath385 which includes all the numerical data . as far as experimental data go in the range of @xmath43 between @xmath386 and @xmath387 we used extrapolation of our cubic spline fit . as a result the peaks just discussed",
    "slightly change their positions and amplitudes but within the @xmath374 uncertainty systematic , experimental and numerical fourier spectra share a peak in common corresponding to the zeldovich effect .",
    "similarly , experimental and numerical spectra continue to share a peak in common due to the effects of the shell structure .",
    "in this paper we analyzed in a model - independent fashion the weakly - bound @xmath0 spectra of the distorted coulomb problem for arbitrary relationship between the range of the inner potential and bohr s radius of the coulomb field .",
    "we demonstrated that the spectra are fairly sensitive to the binding properties of the inner potential which constitutes the essence of the zeldovich effect , and established the corresponding details of spectral changes .",
    "armed with these results , we conducted an analysis of experimental and numerical rydberg spectra of atoms along the periodic table which indeed show an evidence of the zeldovich effect .",
    "our analysis can be extended and adopted in several directions :    first , there is an abundance of experimental and numerical data for atomic rydberg states of finite angular momenta which are likely to contain signatures of the zeldovich effect .",
    "however , in the limit of a very short - ranged inner potential the way the effect manifests itself is somewhat different from its @xmath0 state counterpart @xcite .",
    "this observation makes it pertinent to generalize our analysis to the case of finite angular momentum .",
    "it has been known for some time @xcite that the rydberg formula ( [ rydberg ] ) is superior to the wannier ( bohr ) formula quoted in textbooks @xcite in representing excitonic spectra in condensed matter systems .",
    "experimental examples here include clean and doped rare - gas solids and rare - gas impurities in solid hydrogen .",
    "although this is a context in which the zeldovich effect has been originally discovered @xcite , to the best of our knowledge there were no attempts to relate it to excitonic quantum defects . because of the dielectric screening of the coulomb interaction , the zeldovich effect in these systems",
    "is expected to be more pronounced than in atomic rydberg spectra . only minor changes to our analysis are needed to understand the excitonic rydberg spectra .",
    "other examples of systems where the zeldovich effect should have experimental signatures include rydberg ions and electronic image states @xcite .",
