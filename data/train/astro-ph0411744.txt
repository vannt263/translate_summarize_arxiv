    "one of the most exciting scientific objectives for lisa will be to provide a detailed understanding of the coalescence and gravitational wave emission processes from merging supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei .",
    "the high expected signal - to - noise ratios make these astrophysical events ` visible ' to lisa , up to very high redshifts .",
    "supermassive binary black hole merger events may therefore represent the key to understanding the formation and merger histories of galaxies and their massive central holes .",
    "if supermassive black holes in galactic cores are produced primarily by successive mergers , rather than accretion , then the details of the merger process may also have an impact on the population statistics , particularly the distribution of spins .",
    "the first observational evidence of a galaxy with a pair of active galactic nuclei has recently been provided by x - ray observations of ngc 6240 with the chandra observatory @xcite .",
    "possible evidence of merger events has also been presented in radio observations of x - shaped jet morphologies , which may have been produced by a sudden change in the central black hole s spin axis caused by a supermassive black hole - black hole merger @xcite .    to interpret the observations made by lisa we will require detailed theoretical models , based on einstein s general theory of relativity",
    ". comparisons with accurate numerical simulations will reveal the masses , spins , and orientations of the two black holes , providing not only crucial information about the history and formation of the binary system but also an important precision test of dynamical nonlinear general relativistic gravity .    in this paper we briefly review the results from numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole mergers using the ` lazarus ' approach to model the final moments of a binary black hole merger . in particular",
    ", we focus here on some recent results of the final spin of the black hole remnant formed at the end of a merger process starting from moderately spinning binary black holes .",
    "the final spin of merging massive black holes is crucially related to the birth and growth history of these systems .",
    "we finally present preliminary calculations about recoil velocities for black hole systems of comparable but not equal masses .",
    "while modest recoil velocities are known to be sufficient to eject most coalescing black holes from dwarf galaxies and globular clusters , it is not yet completely understood how these net velocities can influence the growth history of massive black holes at the center of giant elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "the lazarus approach is an effort to explore the modeling of strong field dynamics and radiation generation in the last moments of a binary black hole merger by implementing a hybrid approach , which takes advantage of the complementary strengths and weaknesses of numerical relativity , black hole perturbation theory and eventually post - newtonian approaches . in particular , we follow a full numerical relativity simulation of a binary black hole system merging into a single distorted black hole and , at some transition time @xmath0 , extract data from the simulation which is consequently evolved with black hole perturbation theory in the close limit approximation @xcite .",
    "this approach was successfully developed in refs @xcite and provided the first approximate theoretical estimates for the gravitational radiation waveforms and energy that are generated during the plunge of binary black hole systems .",
    "for non - spinning binary black holes mergers , starting from near the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) at a proper separation of @xmath1 , a burst of radiation is generated during the plunge which lasts for less than half of an orbital period , carrying away about @xmath2 of the system s energy and @xmath3 of its angular momentum . at the end of the coalescence process one",
    "obtains a kerr remnant with a rotation parameter @xmath4 .",
    "a significant qualitative result is the observation that the waveforms have a relatively simple form .",
    "the dominant part of the waveforms show a circular polarization pattern like that for a rotating body , and with a smoothly increasing frequency ( up to the quasinormal ringing frequency ) and smoothly varying amplitude .",
    "these results are consistent with the results recently found in ref .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for proper separations slightly larger than those studied here and similar binary black hole initial data , the black holes are found to be in orbit around each other @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the no hair theorem ( or uniqueness theorem ) is that astrophysical black holes can be completely characterized by their mass @xmath5 and spin parameters @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "spins in massive black holes can be produced by a diversity of mechanisms : the collapse of massive gas accumulations , gas accretion and capture of stellar mass bodies , successive mergers with other massive holes .",
    "therefore the spin of the final black hole remnant is important to understand the supermassive black hole growth history .",
    "recent models using the combined effects of gas accretion and binary coalescences suggest that in effect accretion can be in effect very efficient to spin up the holes to @xmath8 and that black holes may be rapidly rotating in all epochs @xcite . in the merger scenario",
    "spins play an important role .",
    "spins likely drive the outflows of jets in the core of active galaxies @xcite , and appear to be randomly oriented with respect to the plane of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "black hole mergers may realign the spin of the more massive hole , inducing a spin flip of the jet in x - shaped radio morphologies @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we studied the merger of two individual equal mass black holes with spins varying only slowly as the system approaches the isco .",
    "we consider initial spins in the range @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the spin and the apparent horizon mass of each individual hole .",
    "the negative and positive values indicate respectively spins aligned and counter - aligned with the orbital angular momentum so we will only see the non - precessional effects of the strong field spin interactions .",
    "we started our exploratory simulations from sequences of black holes in circular orbits , based on the assumption that the individual black hole spins are not strongly affected by interactions , and thus remain constant through the orbital dynamics .",
    "for both types of data , circular orbits , and an isco can be identified by minimizing the energy of the system at a fixed separation @xcite .",
    "note that recent calculations find a somewhat less tightly bound isco @xcite .",
    "we then applied the lazarus approach to treat several configurations in the described range of initial spins , allowing us to calculate plunge waveforms as well as radiative loss of energy and angular momentum .",
    "we show here that for spinning holes the resulting waveforms have still the same qualitative simple appearance of the non - spinning binaries supporting the idea that a total mass rescaling of the latter waveforms can produce an approximate description for both the aligned and counter - aligned spinning binaries cases .",
    "multipole , as viewed by an observer located along the polar axis .",
    "the waveforms have been rescaled by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath0 indicates the time after which one can treat each system perturbatively as described in the lazarus approach.,width=480 ]     of waveforms described in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescala ] normalized to quasinormal frequencies @xmath13 of the remnant kerr holes .",
    "we see that the quasinormal ringing frequency is approached similarly in each case with a slightly delayed approach for the counter - aligned cases .",
    "this is expected for these plunge waveforms since the anti - aligned spin initial data starts with black holes with larger separations than the aligned spin configurations .",
    ", width=480 ]    in fig.[fig : rescala ] we superpose the waveforms after a rescaling of the time axis by @xmath12 which corresponds to rescaling by mass in the @xmath14 case , where @xmath13 is the least damped quasinormal frequency of the final spinning black hole @xcite .",
    "we observe a good superposition , particularly in the ring - down region of the waveform .",
    "the ring - up shows some deviations from the quasinormal rescaling , not surprisingly , since this part of the waveform is more affected by the orbital history of the binary system .",
    "this similarity is consistent with the observed trend in the instantaneous circular polarization frequency decomposition of the radiation waveforms displayed in fig.[fig : freq ] .",
    "concerning the spin of the final kerr remnant , we find a rotation parameter @xmath15 .",
    "crude extrapolations of these results seem to indicate that nearly maximal rotating black holes with spins parallel to the orbital angular momentum are needed to form a maximally spinning remnant hole .",
    "it is worth to remark here that our results are entirely consistent with the approximate results in ref.@xcite indicating that the remnant spin may be as large as @xmath16 .",
    "the latter estimates are based on assumptions that mass and angular momentum are conserved during the entire coalescence process and using different approximations than our to find the radius of the isco .",
    "complementary studies of binaries in the small mass ratio limit @xcite suggest that it is hard to form a maximally rotating black hole even in the most favorable case of prograde orbits .",
    "the capture of smaller companions with randomly - oriented individual spins tends to spin the hole down .",
    "see ref.@xcite for a review on the subject .    in conclusion",
    ", it is plausible , though not excluded , that binary black hole mergers are not the most efficient mechanism to produce rapidly rotating black holes .",
    "of course rapidly rotating black holes may still be efficiently produced via gas accretion @xcite .",
    "we are currently working with more advanced and accurate numerical relativity simulations to generalize our black hole merger results to nearly equal mass and rapidly spinning holes .",
    "gravitational radiation from the coalescence of unequal mass black hole binaries carries linear momentum , causing the center of mass of the system to recoil .",
    "there is great astrophysical interest in determining the gravitational radiation recoil of binary black holes .",
    "one of the questions one can try to answer is whether binary black holes can be ejected from galaxies . for a galaxy like ours",
    "the escape velocity is of the order of @xmath17 , while for dwarf galaxies and globular clusters the escape velocity is a few tens of @xmath18 . for black holes to escape from large galaxies",
    "the recoil effects have to reach @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "redmount and rees @xcite discuss some astrophysical implications of gravitational radiation rocket effects. merritt @xcite noted that the off centered nuclei observed in some dwarf elliptical galaxies could be explained by such displacement of the black central holes .",
    "other possible effects include changes in the agn activity , smearing of the central density cusp , distribution and growth of supermassive black hole masses .",
    "it may also determine the formation rate of intermediate black holes by ejection of a binary after multiple mergers .",
    "for extreme mass ratios ( @xmath20 ) one can use black hole perturbation theory to describe a test mass inspiraling into a massive kerr hole . a crude extrapolation these results to @xmath21 suggest that the recoil never exceeds @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "fitchett and detweiler @xcite have studied a particle in circular orbits around a schwarzschild black hole and obtain an estimate of @xmath23 and an extrapolation to comparable masses leads up to @xmath24 .",
    "the post - newtonian approximation also leads to small recoil velocities @xcite , but does not treat accurately the plunge phase which is the most relevant in this case .    to study black hole binary systems of comparable masses ( @xmath25 )",
    "one has to make use of full numerical relativity .",
    "since the recoil effects vanishes at both , the equal mass and small mass ratio limits , the maximum linear momentum radiated happens at intermediate mass ratios .",
    "the expected range of @xmath26 for the mass ratios makes numerical relativity to play a crucial role in determining its precise value .",
    "very little is known for these cases . in the headon collision of two comparable mass black holes",
    "the radiated linear momentum was first computed using the close limit approximation @xcite and for several larger initial separations using full 2d nonlinear general relativity in ref.@xcite .      in this paper",
    "we present some preliminary investigations of numerical simulations of unequal but comparable mass non - spinning black holes starting from the isco as computed in ref .",
    "we evolve the strong non - linear merger stage of the collision using a numerical relativity code solving einstein s equations in the adm formalism as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "our simulations are limited to be accurate for less than @xmath27 in time , where m is total adm mass of the system . despite these limitations we are able to maintain a grid spacing of @xmath28 near the black holes .",
    "making use of adapted `` fisheye '' coordinates , our spatial domain extends across about 70 m , so that we can avoid the delicate issue of modeling the boundary by ignoring the regions of spacetime in the causal future of the boundary . at later time , after the black holes have merged into a single distorted rotating black hole we apply the lazarus approach to describe the ring - down of the finally formed black hole .",
    "the linear momentum is computed as in ref .",
    "the results for @xmath29 are summarized in fig.[fig : pxm ] .",
    "we added a point for @xmath30 computed with newly developed improved full numerical techniques using a more stable formulation of einstein s equations @xcite . for completeness",
    "we also show the estimates of the recoil velocity obtained by extrapolating perturbation theory results for the plunge phase using the fittchet s scaling function @xmath31 as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is worth to note here that the addition of the effects of spins of the individual black holes may greatly affect the estimates derived here for non - spinning black holes .",
    "finally , more accurate numerical simulations , perhaps using higher order finite difference codes and/or adaptive mesh refinements techniques , are needed to narrow down the current error bars and explore the @xmath32 region .",
    "the results discussed in this paper have been obtained in collaboration with john baker , carlos lousto and ryoji takahashi .",
    "i thank my collaborators john baker , carlos lousto , and marc favata and david merritt for very useful comments to this manuscript .",
    "i also thank harald pfeiffer for making available to us results from his ph.d thesis .",
