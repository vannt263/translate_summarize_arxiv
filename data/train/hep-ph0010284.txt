    "during the last years , there has been a lot of theoretical and experimental interest in the decay of the @xmath7 into a pair of charged pions and a pair of leptons .",
    "this interest focused on the decay width itself @xcite and on the possibility of constructing cp - violating observables @xcite as well as on other related topics @xcite . from the experimental analysis of the corresponding radiative decay",
    ", it was found that the decay amplitude consists of a bremsstrahlung component and a direct emission part .",
    "the contribution due to bremsstrahlung is given via low s theorem by the amplitude of the decay @xmath8 .",
    "this amplitude is mainly due to the @xmath9 admixture , which allows for this decay ( indirect cp violation ) . as a consequence",
    ", the final state of the radiative decay can be found to be in cp - even as well as cp - odd configurations .",
    "hence , in principle , there is interference between the cp - conserving parts of the direct emission amplitude and the cp - violating bremsstrahlung amplitude .",
    "but as long as the polarization of the on - shell photon is not measured , this interference is not accessible .",
    "this is the reason why one looks directly to the decay with a lepton pair , since the angle between the two planes spanned by the pions and leptons can be used to construct a cp - violating observable @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "i do not focus on the cp - violating aspects of this decay .",
    "i calculate the decay amplitude in chpt up to @xmath3 and use the most recent available data from experiments @xcite ( which were mostly dedicated to the study of possible cp - violating effects ) to derive a value for the unknown combination @xmath10 of low - energy couplings ( lecs ) from the weak @xmath3 chiral lagrangian . until now , theoretical predictions can only be compared to the branching ratio over the entire phase space , which makes it impossible to extract a precise value for this combination .",
    "furthermore , it is not possible to determine this value unambiguously from experiment , therefore one has to turn to lec models and their predictions for low - energy couplings to find the favoured value .",
    "once the value of this particular combination is fixed , i use it as input together with additional assumptions about the weak lec @xmath11 for the second non - leptonic decay discussed in this paper : @xmath1 . if we use new data from the corresponding radiative decay @xmath12 @xcite",
    ", we can give the magnetic amplitude of @xmath13 without any unknown parameter at @xmath3 and it is possible to predict the branching ratio @xmath14 as a function of the unknown combination @xmath15 of weak lecs .",
    "chiral perturbation theory @xcite is the ideally suited framework to discuss these processes .",
    "it is the low - energy realization of the standard model respecting the approximate chiral symmetry of the light quark sector .",
    "in fact , the demand of invariance under chiral rotations ( in our case , these are @xmath16 rotations ) allows one to write down the most general effective lagrangian of strong interactions amongst the light pseudoscalar meson octet .",
    "the approximate chiral symmetry @xmath17 seems to be realized  la nambu - goldstone , which means that it is spontaneously broken to the well - known @xmath18 .",
    "the breakdown of the symmetry gives rise to eight almost massless would - be goldstone bosons because there are eight broken axial generators .",
    "according to goldstone s theorem , the quantum numbers of these particles are fixed by the quantum numbers of the broken generators , thus one identifies the light pseudoscalars with these particles . in the scheme of gasser and leutwyler @xcite",
    ", the most general @xmath19 lagrangian including strong , electromagnetic and semileptonic weak interactions reads as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the covariant derivative with respect to external , non - propagating fields . if we specialize to the case of external photons , @xmath22 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "q&=&\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\mbox{diag}(2,-1,-1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where q is the quark charge matrix for the flavours @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is a @xmath27 unitary matrix which has to be expanded to the relevant order in @xmath6 : @xmath28 where the mesons are collected in the matrix @xmath6 : @xmath29 @xmath30 equals to lowest order the pion decay constant , @xmath31 mev . in general",
    ", @xmath32 contains external scalar and pseudoscalar matrix - valued fields , but here it is proportional to the quark mass matrix . in this way ,",
    "explicit chiral symmetry breaking can be incorporated in the effective lagrangians in a very elegant way : @xmath33 @xmath34 is related to the order parameter of the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry , the quark condensate .",
    "it will not appear explicitly because it can be absorbed in the squared meson masses .",
    "for the calculation of non - leptonic kaon decays , we also need an effective lagrangian describing the weak interactions of the mesons .",
    "this effective weak lagrangian can not be invariant under chiral rotations , hence chiral invariance can not be the guideline . starting from an effective strangeness - changing @xmath35 four - quark hamiltonian ,",
    "one writes down a hadronically realized lagrangian that transforms in the same way under @xmath17 as this hamiltonian . at lowest order ,",
    "the needed weak lagrangian is found to be : @xmath36 + h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 projects out the correct octet quantum numbers and @xmath38 is the hadronic left - chiral current in analogy to the left - chiral quark current at the level of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the two couplings @xmath39 and @xmath40 have to be obtained from experiment and the determination of these couplings involves some subtleties . in principle , the couplings are obtained from @xmath41 decays .",
    "comparison of experiments with the leading order @xmath19 calculations yields the canonical values @xmath42 , where this approximate ratio of the two couplings introduces uncertainties when the @xmath43-plet coupling enters the game .",
    "however , due to the smallness of the @xmath43-plet coupling , one can usually neglect this part of the lagrangian unless the octet contribution vanishes",
    ". then also the @xmath43-plet contribution may become important ( see sect .",
    "3.2 ) . for completeness",
    ", one should remark that in ref .",
    "@xcite the relevant @xmath41 decays were analyzed up to @xmath3 and it was found that these additional corrections contribute to @xmath39 with about 30% , whereas the @xmath40 coupling is only modified by a few percent .",
    "thus , if one takes into account these order @xmath44 corrections , the value of the coupling @xmath45 appearing in ( [ l2 ] ) should better be @xmath46 . throughout this work , however , i am using the canonical standard values .",
    "the chiral lagrangians ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) allow us to calculate tree - level amplitudes of chiral order @xmath47 and one - loop diagrams of chiral order @xmath44 which usually introduce divergences . in order",
    "to get rid of these divergences and to take into account further finite local corrections appearing at @xmath3 , e.g. through new interactions arising from the chiral anomaly , one also has to consider the most general @xmath3 interaction lagrangians .",
    "the most general strong lagrangian of order @xmath44 , invariant under c , p and chiral transformations , was again given by gasser and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "there is only one term in this lagrangian that contributes to the final results in this work : @xmath48 since we are interested in external photons , the @xmath49 tensors are proportional to the ordinary electromagnetic field strength tensor : @xmath50 every new term in the strong lagrangian of order @xmath44 is furnished with an a priori unknown low - energy coupling ( lec ) @xcite . since all divergences appear as local polynomials , one can absorb the divergences of the loop amplitude in the lecs .",
    "the general structure of a lec reads as @xmath51,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "this is also true for weak lecs @xmath53 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath54 arise from the one - loop generating functional .",
    "because of the regularization procedure , the measurable couplings @xmath55 ( and @xmath56 ) become scale dependent . in the end , this scale dependence must be compensated by the scale dependent parts of loop diagrams .",
    "one should also note that the chiral subtraction prescription differs from the usual modified ms prescription .",
    "the new octet weak interactions are organized like this @xcite : @xmath57 for the non - leptonic kaon decays under consideration , only the operators @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 contribute ; they are listed explicitly : @xmath62 the magnetic terms ( proportional to @xmath63 ) are given by @xmath64\\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\ w_{30 } & = & \\langle \\lambda u^{\\dagger}d_{\\mu}u\\rangle\\langle(\\tilde{f}_l^{\\mu\\nu}+u^{\\dagger}\\tilde{f}_r^{\\mu\\nu}u ) d_{\\nu}u^{\\dagger}u\\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\ w_{31 } & = & \\langle \\lambda u^{\\dagger}d_{\\mu}u\\rangle \\langle(\\tilde{f}_l^{\\mu\\nu}-u^{\\dagger}\\tilde{f}_r^{\\mu\\nu}u)d_{\\nu}u^{\\dagger}u\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath65 the dual tensor of ( [ ten ] ) , @xmath66 .",
    "finally , we introduce a lagrangian that embodies contributions from reducible diagrams with a wzw - vertex and an @xmath19 @xmath35 vertex .",
    "it only contributes to the @xmath5 decay and is given by @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the dual of the ordinary electromagnetic field strength tensor ( [ ten ] ) , @xmath69 , and the covariant derivative is the usual qed derivative .",
    "for both decays , the general form of the invariant amplitude due to covariance is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the momentum of the virtual photon , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the momenta of the electron and positron , respectively .",
    "@xmath74 is the generic weak @xmath75 vertex , calculated in chpt .",

    "a separate term proportional to the photon momentum vanishes because of the dirac equation .",
    "the form factors are either constants or scalar functions of various products of the involved momenta .",
    "this decay had already been considered in the framework of chpt in @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used a different basis of counterterms ( this change of basis is only valid as long as one is only interested in photons in ( [ covder ] ) ) and a different approximation of the magnetic part of the amplitude not taking into account any energy dependence .",
    "the present calculation considers this energy dependent part @xcite , too , and additionally serves as a check on the results in ref .",
    "for this decay , i assume strong isospin conservation , i.e. the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 quark have equal masses .",
    "hence , the gell - mann - okubo mass relation holds and we only have to deal with two independent masses : @xmath85 . it will be used to simplify parts of the one - loop amplitude given in the appendix . in this paper ,",
    "i use the following definitions : @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 . @xmath9 and @xmath89",
    "are related to the strangeness eigenstates @xmath90 and @xmath91 through the following expressions : @xmath92 the tree - level amplitude is entirely due to the @xmath9 admixture , since we do not consider direct sources of cp violation . in any case , the tree - level contribution is rather suppressed , especially when compared to the @xmath5 decay ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) .    from figure [ f1 ]",
    "one obtains the following tree - level form factors : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the parameter of indirect cp violation . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we do not take into account @xmath3 corrections proportional to @xmath95 to the electric form factors . as mentioned in sect .",

    "comparison with experiment yields two possible values of the lec combination @xmath286 , thus one has to consult theoretical approaches about weak counterterm couplings to distinguish between the possible solutions .",
    "all models that have been considered ( weak deformation model wdm @xcite , factorization model fm @xcite , modified factorization model fmv @xcite ) prefer the same value of @xmath399 .",
    "of course , the error , which is mainly due to the experimental uncertainties of the two parameters of the magnetic amplitude , is quite large , but nevertheless the obtained result is reasonable compared to @xmath400 and it rests upon a firm theoretical ground . on the other hand ,",
    "the central value of @xmath2 is almost in perfect agreement with the fm and wdm predictions .",
    "one also derives central values for the two parameters of the fmv that are in good agreement with the expectations . since 1997 , much more data have been collected by the ktev group and therefore one can hope that a new analysis of the much bigger set of events can reduce the experimental uncertainties . as already pointed out in sect .",
    "4.2 , it should also be possible to extract the value of @xmath2 to a better precision by comparing the theoretical results with branching ratios for higher cuts in @xmath158 ( e.g. @xmath401 ) , since the contributions from loops and counterterms become much more important for higher cuts than for the entire phase space . to be able to make a useful prediction for the @xmath5 decay",
    ", one has to rely on additional theoretical assumptions .",
    "first , i followed the predictions of the fm and wdm and assumed that the extracted value @xmath402 is produced solely by @xmath298 and that @xmath355 .",
    "it is therefore possible to express the branching ratio for @xmath1 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "contrary to the decay of the @xmath7 , there exists an interference between the tree - level amplitude and the electric @xmath3 amplitude . in general",
    ", it is found that the branching ratio due to the electric part of the decay amplitude clearly dominates over the magnetic contributions .",
    "moreover , it is the tree level that produces by far the most important contributions to the br over the entire phase space as well as for a wide range of cuts in @xmath158 .",
    "an extraction of the combination @xmath403 from the branching ratio over the entire phase space is almost impossible , but according to the discussion in sect . 4.4 , with a scan of the @xmath158 spectrum it is more likely to extract values for @xmath4 , especially for cuts larger than @xmath404",
    ". obviously the experimental error of the magnetic part of the amplitude and the error of the combination @xmath2 will not make it easier to extract a reasonable value , but hopefully new results from ktev ( and from cern ) also help to improve the predictive power of this analysis . whereas the analysis summarized so far was based on conservative assumptions , i also speculated about extracting values for @xmath297 , @xmath315 , @xmath298 and @xmath11 .",
    "referring to the fmv , the two parameters of the model were estimated using the available data and the extracted value of @xmath2 .",
    "the central values of these parameters were further used to estimate the central values of the four low - energy couplings @xmath297 , @xmath315 , @xmath298 and @xmath11 and to make a prediction of the @xmath5 branching ratio without any free parameter .",
    "although the errors are big , the obtained values for the lecs seem to be reasonable .",
    "most of this work was done in vienna and i would like to thank g. ecker for his help through a long time .",
    "i thank g. isidori , g. dambrosio , j. portols and r. escribano for helpful discussions on physics and computing .",
    "i am grateful for important comments on the experimental input by t. barker , b. cox and s. ledovskoy from the ktev collaboration .",
    "finally , g. pancheri should be mentioned since she made it possible for me to come to the lnf in frascati .",
    "all loop integrals in this work can be reduced to a basis of three scalar integrals : @xmath405 where i introduced the abbreviations @xmath406 $ ] , @xmath407[(k - q)^2-m^2]$ ] and @xmath408[(k - q)^2-m^2][(k - p)^2-m^2]$ ] .",
    "indexed loop functions are defined through the following relations : @xmath409 they can be given explicitly in terms of ( [ basis ] ) .",
