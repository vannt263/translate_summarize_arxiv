    "the theme of this workshop , clock synchronization , has occupied a prominent position at the frontier of technology for a long time . from a recent article by peter galison @xcite",
    ", i learned that the international conference on chronometry in 1900 included a session devoted to the problem of clock synchronization .",
    "this was an urgent problem at the time , especially in europe , where a single track would often carry railroad traffic in both directions , so that precise scheduling was necessary to avoid disastrous collisions .    according to galison , the technical community s keen interest in clock coordination 100 years ago",
    "could not have escaped the attention of a certain patent clerk in bern named einstein @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ meanwhile , all around him , literally , was the burgeoning fascination with electrocoordinated time .",
    "every day einstein took the short stroll from his house , left down the kramgasse to the patent office ; every day he must have seen the great clock towers that presided over bern with their coordinated clocks , and the myriad of street clocks branched proudly to the central telegraph office . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    to galison , whose work often highlights the role of technology in the development of scientific ideas , it is irresistible to speculate that the preoccupation with clock coordination circa 1900 helped to steer einstein to the insight that simultaneity is the key concept for understanding the electrodynamics of moving bodies , and so may have inspired the most famous scientific paper of the past century .    to me as a theoretical physicist , a pleasing outcome of a workshop like this one would be that our musings about clock synchronization lead to conceptual insights into the properties of quantum information . some might hope for a flow of ideas in the other direction , but both directions can be beneficial .",
    "most of this talk will concern a scenario in which two parties , alice and bob , both have good local clocks that are stable and accurate , and wish to synchronize these clocks in their common rest frame .",
    "one method that works , and does not require alice and bob to have accurate knowledge of the distance between them , is slow clock transport ( sct ) , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sct ] .",
    "alice has a traveling clock that she synchronizes with her local clock ( event @xmath0 ) and then sends to bob , who receives it and reads it ( event @xmath1 ) . when bob reads the clock it has advanced by @xmath2 , the proper time along the clock s world line that has elapsed during transit . if the clock moved slowly , then @xmath2 is close to the elapsed time as measured by alice s clock during the transit , so that bob can synchronize his clock with alice s .",
    "sct works but it is not very sexy",
    ". it would be more fun to use a method that exploits the resource of quantum entanglement , what the jpl group @xcite called quantum ( atomic ) clock synchronization ( quacs or qcs ) , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcs ] .",
    "so now suppose that alice and bob have a co - conspirator charlie , who prepares maximally entangled pairs ( event @xmath3 ) ; let s suppose that the state of each pair is the singlet state @xmath4 .",
    "charlie sends half of each pair to alice , and half to bob .",
    "alice measures the observable @xmath5 of her qubits ( event @xmath0 ) , and bob measures x of his qubits ( event @xmath1 ) . comparing their results , alice and bob can infer the value of @xmath6 the proper time along the world line of the qubits that moves from @xmath0 backward in time to @xmath3 and then forward in time to @xmath1 . if the qubits were transported slowly , this difference of proper times is close to the time difference @xmath7 in the reference frame in which alice and bob are at rest .",
    "both protocols work , but qcs is more technically demanding than sct , so why would we prefer qcs ? perhaps if we need to synchronize periodically , rather than just once , we ll find it convenient to ship many pairs of qubits ahead of time and save them until they are needed , rather than sending another clock on demand every time we need to synchronize .",
    "but when i first heard about the idea that quantum information could be used for clock synchronization ( from hideo mabuchi @xcite ) , what seemed intriguing to me is that we might be able to correct phase errors that afflict the traveling qubits , by _ purifying _ the shared entanglement . in  iii - vii ,",
    "i ll explain why i havent been able to get this idea to work .",
    "to assess whether entanglement purification might improve the accuracy of clock synchronization , let us begin by looking at the qcs protocol in more detail .",
    "our qubits are two - level atoms , each governed by the hamiltonian @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the pairs prepared by charlie are in the state @xmath10 which is stationary ( i m not bothering to write factors of @xmath11 here . ) when alice measures @xmath12 , obtaining the outcome @xmath13 , she prepares for bob on the same time slice the state @xmath14 , which evolves after time @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "then bob measures @xmath12 , obtaining the outcome @xmath17 with probability @xmath18 alice and bob confer so that bob knows for which qubits the result of her @xmath12 measurement was @xmath17 . then with @xmath19 qubits , the time @xmath15 can be determined to an accuracy @xmath20    it is instructive to consider what would happen if the pairs prepared by charlie were not really @xmath4 s , but were instead in the state @xmath21 this is the state that would be obtained if the time evolution operator , for bob s qubit only , were to act on the initial state @xmath22 for time @xmath23 . with the pairs in this state ,",
    "when alice measures @xmath12 she prepares for bob one of the states @xmath24 , which will evolve in time @xmath15 to @xmath25 therefore , the apparent time offset detected in the qcs protocol will be @xmath26 rather than @xmath15 . if , without telling alice and bob , charlie replaces the @xmath4 s by @xmath27 s , then alice and bob will think that their clocks are synchronized even though bob s really lags behind alice s by @xmath28 .",
    "if alice and bob perform sct or qcs , dephasing of the qubits will weaken the signal .",
    "if bob measures his qubit a time @xmath15 after alice measures @xmath29 of hers , the probability that bob finds @xmath30 is @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the phase damping factor , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the time that the qubits have been exposed to phase noise and @xmath35 is the damping time .",
    "( we have assumed that there are no systematic phase errors  the noise has zero mean . )    the damage to the qubits caused by phase damping might be reversed by an entanglement purification protocol , where an initial supply of noisy entangled pairs is `` distilled '' to a smaller number that approximate @xmath4 with better fidelity @xcite .",
    "such a protocol is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : purify ] .",
    "alice and bob select two pairs , and each performs an operation on her / his half of the two pairs , culminating in a bilateral @xmath12 measurement that destroys one of the two pairs . if alice and bob get the same measurement result when they measure pair number 2 , then they retain pair number 1 ; otherwise , they throw pair number 1 away .",
    "= 3.5 in    how does it work ?",
    "alice and bob want to have pairs with @xmath36 .",
    "their bilateral procedure allows them to measure @xmath37 the value is @xmath38 if one of the pairs has a phase error , and it is @xmath17 if either both pairs are good or both pairs are bad .",
    "hence , as long as the original ensemble approximates @xmath4 with good enough fidelity ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath39 ) , the pairs that are retained have higher fidelity than the original pairs .",
    "we need to notice though , that in order for the purification protocol to achieve its intended purpose , alice s and bob s operations must be perfectly synchronized .",
    "if bob s operations were to systematically lag behind alice s by time @xmath28 , then the protocol would actually distill an eigenstate of @xmath40 namely the state @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , if alice and bob first distill their pairs and then perform qcs , all they will be able to detect is a _ relative _ offset , the difference between the offset used in the purification protocol and the offset used in qcs .",
    "but this is information they could discern by reading their accurate local clocks",
    ". they would not gain anything from consuming their shared entanglement .",
    "we might try this alternative procedure : to combat dephasing , charlie does not prepare raw entangled pairs of qubits , but instead he _ encodes _ the pairs using a quantum error - correcting code that resists phase errors . the encoded qubits can be actively stabilized as they travel to alice and bob , so that they are sure to arrive safely",
    ". then alice and bob can execute qcs .",
    "but if phase errors are the enemy then there is a problem , because the phase rotation due to the natural evolution of the raw qubits is one kind of error that the code is designed to resist .",
    "the stabilization of the encoded state freezes this natural evolution .",
    "alice can decode her qubit and measure @xmath12 , but if bob is still preserving his encoded qubit , alice s action will not `` start the clock '' of bob s qubit on the same time slice ; rather its evolution will remain frozen .",
    "in fact then , all alice and bob can learn about if they first decode and then execute qcs , is a _ relative _ offset : the difference of the offset used in decoding and the offset of the final measurements .",
    "again , this is information that can be inferred by referring to alice s and bob s local clocks .",
    "the difficulty we have encountered here is closely related to the obstacle that has so far prevented us from finding a powerful way to use quantum error - correcting codes to improve frequency standards .",
    "we would like to use quantum error correction to stabilize a _ precessing _ qubit that can serve as an accurate standard ; therefore the natural evolution of the qubits should preserve the code subspace ( _ i.e. _ , should commute with the code stabilizer ) .",
    "this requirement strongly restricts the error - correcting power of the code .",
    "one code with the desired property is the repetition code , which can correct coherent bit flip errors ( that is , stochastic @xmath12 errors ) ; the encoded state evolves as @xmath42 this is just the rapidly precessing cat state whose advantages have been extolled by the nist group @xcite . if the limiting factor in the accuracy of the standard were a `` bit - flip '' channel , then this state could be actively stabilized by quantum error correction .    as a mathematical statement , this is not completely vacuous , since it is possible in principle for the precision in the measurement of the precession rate to be limited by bit - flip errors .",
    "[ fig : master ] shows the decay of the polarization of a qubit , found by integrating the master equation , for a bit - flip channel and a dephasing channel with comparable rates .",
    "qualitatively , they are similar ; the visible difference is that the bit - flips ( @xmath12 errors ) do not damage the @xmath43-component of the polarization .",
    "the bit - flip damage can be controlled by the quantum repetition code ; the phase damping can not be .",
    "while correct as a mathematical statement , this is not a very useful observation , since i do nt know of any realistic physical setting in which a bit - flip channel really limits the accuracy of an interesting measurement .",
    "what is really `` quantum '' about the qcs protocol ?",
    "of course , each `` clock '' is a qubit , so when we read it we acquire at best one bit of information , and we need many qubits to estimate a time offset accurately .",
    "but it is worthwhile to emphasize that the correlations that were exploited might as well have been classical rather than quantum correlations .",
    "that is , although we have said that the qcs protocol exploits entanglement , we have only used the property that the state @xmath22 has two qubits with correlated values of @xmath12 ; it makes no difference to us that the qubits are also correlated in the complementary variable @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , it would work nearly as well for charlie to prepare a product state @xmath45 .",
    "unlike the entangled state @xmath22 , this state is not stationary ; in time @xmath34 it evolves to @xmath46 if alice and bob both measure @xmath12 , how strongly correlated their results are depends on the time offset of their measurements , as is the case if charlie prepares @xmath4 s .",
    "specifically , if there is no dephasing of the qubits , then if bob measures a time @xmath15 after alice , and we average over the time @xmath34 since charlie s preparation ( which is assumed to be completely unknown ) , then the probability that bob finds @xmath47 if alice does is @xmath48 the signal is weaker then if alice and bob perform qcs , so that they need @xmath49 product pairs to find @xmath15 to the same accuracy as with @xmath19 entangled pairs , but that is not a very heavy price to pay in return for the advantages of working with product states rather than entangled states .",
    "( of course , with sct we do nt have to pay even that price ",
    "@xmath19 qubits sent from alice to bob are as effective as @xmath19 entangled pairs measured by alice and bob . )",
    "what about the purification ?",
    "since it involves coherent processing , there may seem to be something quantum about it  i m not sure i would know how to make a collective observation on two pairs of analog classical clocks without actually reading each clock .",
    "but since the correlations are essentially classical , we are not really making any use of the essentially quantum features of entanglement purification .    if we are really interested in , say , using our entanglement for epr quantum key distribution , then purification may be essential for achieving _ quantum privacy amplification _ ",
    "it is how we ensure that no potential eavesdropper has more than a negligible amount of information about the key . since in qcs",
    "we are really exploiting a correlation that is essentially classical , the purification does nt buy us anything , at least if there are no systematic phase errors ( if the phase noise has zero mean ) .",
    "for example , suppose that our supply of pairs is a mixture of @xmath4 s and @xmath50 s with fidelity @xmath51 : @xmath52 then bob s measurement of his precessing qubit is governed by the probability distribution @xmath53 so that with @xmath19 pairs we can determine @xmath15 to accuracy @xmath54 if we perform one round of purification ( perfectly synchronized ) , the number of surviving pairs is reduced ( on average ) to @xmath55 while the fidelity of the remaining pairs improves to @xmath56 therefore , if we perform qcs with the remaining pairs we can determine @xmath15 to the accuracy @xmath57 if the fidelity is close to one , purification hurts , because we waste half the pairs needlessly . even for fidelity @xmath58 with @xmath59 , purification",
    "does nt help : we can boost @xmath60 by a factor of about two , but we re no better off because the number of pairs is reduced by a factor of about 4 .    in principle , purification might reduce _ systematic _ phase errors . for example , suppose that all of the pairs are identical , but with the unknown phase error @xmath61 @xmath62 though the states are maximally entangled , alice and bob ca nt fully exploit the entanglement if they do nt know the value of @xmath61 .",
    "now if they execute the ( perfectly synchronized ) purification protocol , the number of pairs is reduced ( on average ) to @xmath63~,\\ ] ] and the phase of the remaining pairs becomes @xmath64 where @xmath65 after a few rounds , @xmath61 is small  alice and bob have extracted from the initial supply of unknown entangled states a smaller number of known entangled states .",
    "now this sounds like it could be useful .",
    "if alice and bob perform qcs using the pairs with a systematic phase error , that systematic error will show up in their measurement of their time offset .",
    "if they can trade in the original pairs with unknown phase for a reduced supply of pairs with known phase , it s a win .",
    "but as already discussed , the `` purification '' protocol actually replaces the original supply with a reduced supply where the phase of the new pairs is determined by their time offset and therefore _ still _ unknown .",
    "alice and bob are no better off .",
    "the `` recurrence '' protocol @xcite that we have described is relatively simple to execute ( though still not easy ) , but if we are willing to do more sophisticated coherent processing , there are much more efficient protocols that waste far fewer pairs . in particular , there is a `` hashing '' protocol @xcite , requiring only one - way communication from alice to bob , that ( according to standard shannon arguments ) yields , from @xmath19 initial pairs with fidelity @xmath51 , a supply of distilled pairs , where the fidelity of the distilled pairs is as close as desired to @xmath66 ; the number @xmath67 of distilled pairs is asymptotically ( for large @xmath19 ) close to @xmath68~,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the binary entropy function .",
    "( i m assuming that the only errors we have to worry about are phase errors . )",
    "this hashing protocol really seems to be a quantum protocol : it involves collective measurement of many qubits at once , and i do nt think there is an analogous operation that could be performed on a supply of classical analog clocks .",
    "furthermore , since if has a much better yield of highly distilled pairs than the recurrence protocol , it really does seem to be capable , in principle , of significantly improving our sensitivity to the time offset between alice and bob .",
    "but there s a problem , really the same problem as that encountered when we imagined that charlie creates encoded pairs that are actively stabilized through quantum error correction . to approach the optimal yield of distilled pairs given in eq .",
    "( [ shannon_yield ] ) , alice and bob use a phase - error correcting quantum code that they have agreed on in advance .",
    "alice measures the stabilizer generators of the code and sends the measurement outcomes to bob , who also measures the same generators and then corrects errors to prepare a supply of high fidelity encoded pairs .",
    "but the pairs are encoded , and the natural evolution of the qubits does not preserve the code space .",
    "therefore , alice and bob need to decode the pairs before performing qcs , and once again they will only be able to detect the offset in qcs _ relative _ to the offset used in the decoding ( and the measurement of the stabilizer operators ) .    in short , if quantum information really offers an advantage for clock synchronization , we do nt seem to be realizing that advantage in the qcs protocol , as far as i can see .",
    "perhaps it is because the protocol is really `` too classical . ''",
    "while there seems to be an obstacle to using entanglement purification to improve the reliability of clock synchronization , alice and bob can nevertheless use purification to enhance the efficacy of other protocols , such as epr key distribution or teleportation , even if they do not have synchronized clocks .",
    "we have seen that if bob s clock lags behind alice s by the unknown offset @xmath28 , then by executing the usual distillation procedure , alice and bob can prepare high fidelity pairs in the state @xmath70 if , say , alice wants to teleport the unknown state @xmath71 to bob , then with good @xmath4 s , alice s joint measurement on the unknown state and her member of the entangled pair would prepare in bob s laboratory on the same time slice one of the states @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is known from alice s measurement .",
    "if the pairs are in the state @xmath27 instead , then alice s measurement prepares @xmath74 this state evolves in time @xmath28 to @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , if bob s operation lags behind alice s by the same amount in both the purification and the teleportation , the teleportation works normally .",
    "this is good news , because it means that alice and bob do nt need to know the offset @xmath28 in order to use purification to improve such protocols .",
    "but the bad news is that ( consistent with our earlier observations ) , after purifying alice and bob ca nt use the fidelity of teleportation as a criterion for judging how well their operations are synchronized .",
    "let s return now to the theme with which i began : that this workshop invites us to reconsider some aspects of quantum information theory in a relativistic setting .",
    "in fact , there is a question about relativistic quantum theory that has bothered me for a while , and ruminating about clock synchronization has stimulated me to reconsider it .",
    "the question is : _ what is an observable?_. the standard answer in quantum field theory is that an observable is a self - adjoint operator that can be defined on a spacelike slice through spacetime .",
    "but this is not the right answer in general , not if we mean by an observable something that could really be measured in principle . for many self - adjoint operators ,",
    "if they could really be `` measured , '' the measurement would allow spacelike - separated parties to communicate .",
    "when i speak of a `` measurement '' of observable @xmath0 occuring on a time - slice , i do nt mean that the outcome of the measurement is instantly known by anyone .",
    "rather i mean that the density operator @xmath75 decoheres on that time slice as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the set of orthogonal projectors onto the eigenspaces of the observable . later on , if information from various locations on the slice arrives at a central location , the outcome can be inferred and recorded .    now suppose that alice and bob share a quantum state @xmath78 . at time",
    "@xmath79 , alice performs a unitary transformation , @xmath80 , @xmath81 at time @xmath82 the superoperator eq .",
    "( [ meas_so ] ) acts on the state , and at time @xmath83 , bob performs a measurement on his density operator , @xmath84~.\\ ] ] if alice and bob are spacelike separated , then the superoperator can be physically realizable only if it is _ causal _  bob s density operator must not depend on the unitary transformation that alice applies .",
    "how can the causal observables be characterized ?",
    "are all causal observables physically implementable in principle ?    to clarify the concept ,",
    "let s consider an example , noted by sorkin @xcite , of a measurement that is not causal .",
    "it is a two - outcome incomplete bell measurement performed on a pair of qubits .",
    "the orthogonal projectors corresponding to the two outcomes are @xmath85 suppose that the initial pure state shared by alice and bob is @xmath86 .",
    "this state is orthogonal to @xmath4 , so that outcome 2 occurs with probability one , and the state is unmodified by the superoperator .",
    "afterwards bob still has a density operator @xmath87 .",
    "but what if , before the superoperator acts , alice performs a unitary that rotates the state to @xmath88 ?",
    "since this is an equally weighted superposition of @xmath4 and @xmath50 , the two outcomes occur equiprobably , and in either case the final state is maximally entangled , so that bob s density operator afterwards is @xmath89 .",
    "bob can make a measurement that has a good chance of distinguishing the density operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 , so that bob can decipher a message sent by alice .",
    "the measurement superoperator is acausal .",
    "an obvious example of an operation that _ is _ causal is measurement of a tensor product observable @xmath92  alice and bob can induce decoherence in the basis of eigenstates of a tensor product through only local actions .",
    "but there are other examples of causal operations that are a bit less obvious .",
    "one is complete bell measurement , _",
    "i.e. _ decoherence in the bell basis @xmath93 .",
    "no matter what alice does , the shared state after bell measurement is maximally entangled , so that bob always has @xmath89 , and he ca nt extract any information about alice s activities . though bell measurement is a causal operation , it is not something that alice and bob can achieve locally without additional resources .",
    "now one wonders , why should there exist causal operations that can not be implemented locally ?",
    "a possible answer is that there are previously prepared resources that alice and bob might share , that while two weak to allow faster - than - light communication , are strong enough to enable decoherence in the bell basis .",
    "one such resource might be shared entanglement ; in the case of complete bell measurement , an even weaker resource will do  shared randomness .",
    "suppose that alice and bob both have the same string of random bits .",
    "this is a useful resource . in particular",
    ", the whole idea of quantum key distribution is to establish secure shared randomness ",
    "alice uses a random key for encoding , bob for decoding , and if eve does nt know the key she ca nt decode the message .",
    "the shared random string also allows alice and bob to induce decoherence in the bell basis .",
    "they share a pair of qubits , and on the same time slice , they both consult two bits of the string ; depending on whether they read @xmath94 or @xmath95 , they both apply the unitary operator @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "the superoperator @xmath98\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] annihilates all the terms in @xmath75 that are off the diagonal in the bell basis . by a similar method ,",
    "randomness shared by @xmath19 parties enables decoherence in the basis of simultaneous eigenstates of any set of commuting operators , where each operator is a tensor product of pauli operators .    with dave beckman , daniel gottesman , and michael nielsen ,",
    "i have been mulling over the problem of characterizing causal operations for several months . at",
    "first we guessed that any causal superoperator ( one that does not allow alice to signal bob or bob to signal alice ) can be implemented if alice and bob share entanglement and perform local operations , but beckman @xcite discovered counterexamples .",
    "all of the cases studied so far are consistent with a modified conjecture , suggested by david divincenzo :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conjecture _ : a superoperator that does not allow alice to send a signal to bob can be implemented with    * local operations by alice and bob , * one - way quantum communication from bob to alice . _",

    "on the one hand , it _ is _ clear that the two resources listed are too weak to allow alice to signal bob .",
    "but on the other hand , one - way communication from bob to alice is not achievable when alice and bob are spacelike separated , so an operation that can be implemented with these resources can not necessarily be applied on a time slice . in quantum physics , there is a perplexing gap between what is _ causal _ and what is _ local_.",
    "it is a captivating challenge to find ways in which quantum error correction and/or entanglement purification can be invoked to improve the accuracy of clock synchronization or frequency standards .",
    "but my efforts so far have not met with much success .",
    "i d like to comment here on an issue that i did nt mention in my talk at the meeting . a problem related to the issues i discussed in my talk , but",
    "in a sense logically independent , arises if we consider in more detail how an `` @xmath12 measurement '' is actually performed with real atomic clocks : a @xmath99 pulse is applied that rotates @xmath12 eigenstates to @xmath44 eigenstates , and then @xmath44 is measured .",
    "thus , if both alice and bob are to measure @xmath12 , they need to establish a `` phase lock '' to ensure that they are really using the same convention to define @xmath12 .",
    "an approach to this problem was suggested in @xcite , but criticized in @xcite and @xcite .    at the meeting , both dave wineland and paul kwiat proposed an alternative approach .",
    "they suggested applying the concept of a `` decoherence - free subspace '' @xcite to encode alice s phase convention in a robust two - qubit stationary state that can be sent to bob .",
    "this proposal relies on the assumption that two qubits transported together will be subjected to identical phase errors in the preferred basis @xmath100 ; thus an eigenstate of the operator @xmath101 will be invulnerable to phase errors . if we encode the logical qubit @xmath102 as @xmath103 then the encoded state resists dephasing .",
    "alice and bob both have local interrogating oscillators that are used to apply @xmath99 pulses . at the time that she calls 0",
    ", alice can apply a pulse that prepares @xmath104 , she can encode that state as @xmath105 , and she can send that encoded state to bob .",
    "bob can decode it and measure it at the time he calls @xmath34 , and thereby ( if alice sends many such encoded states ) , he can lock his phase convention at time @xmath34 to alice s convention at time @xmath106 .",
    "this shared phase convention might be useful , but in itself it does not solve the problem of synchronizing alice s clock with bob s .",
    "we can also ask how well the assumptions of a preferred dephasing basis , and identical phase errors on qubits traveling together , apply in a realistic physical setting .",
    "these may be reasonable assumptions if @xmath107 and @xmath108 are energy eigenstates of a two - level atom , and the dephasing is dominated by fluctuating electromagnetic fields .",
    "the same idea works if @xmath107 and @xmath108 are linear polarization states of a photon , aligned with the preferred axes of the optical medium @xcite .",
    "the clock synchronization problem might be viewed as an entry into a fascinating subject  relativistic quantum information theory .",
    "i ve reported here on some modest progress toward a better understanding of one issue in this theory : the structure of causal observables .",
