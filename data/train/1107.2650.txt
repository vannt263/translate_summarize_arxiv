    "one of the most interesting brane configuration to have been discovered in the last two decades is probably the supertube . in its original incarnation @xcite ,",
    "the supertube is a moving d2 brane in which d0 branes and f1 strings are dissolved .",
    "what makes this d2 brane special is the fact that the d0 and f1 densities satisfy a relation that allows the d2 brane to have an arbitrary shape that can follow any closed curve in the eight dimensions transverse to the f1 and yet remain supersymmetric @xcite .",
    "the eight killing spinors preserved by the supertube are exactly the same as the common killing spinors of its `` electric '' components : the d0 branes and f1 strings .",
    "the fact that there are _ supersymmetric _ string theory configurations determined by arbitrary continuous functions might appear unexpected , especially if one is used to thinking about the supersymmetries preserved by infinite , flat branes at angles .",
    "nevertheless , one can dualize the supertube into a fundamental string that carries an arbitrary left - moving momentum profile , and supertubes of various shapes are simply dual to various ways of putting bps momentum modes on the fundamental string @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature of supertubes is that , in the duality frame in which the electric charges are those of d1 and d5 branes , the back - reacted supertube solution can be made into a smooth geometry @xcite .",
    "moreover , since this solution can be put in an asymptotically @xmath7 geometry , the back - reacted supertube geometries can be related to various half - bps microstates of the d1-d5 cft , and the entropy of the half - bps d1-d5 system can be reproduced by counting the smooth horizonless supertube configurations @xcite .",
    "this has led to the conjecture by mathur that similar physics will be at work in the three - charge d1-d5-p system , and therefore the entropy of the d1-d5-p black hole will come from string and brane configurations that do not have a horizon and have unitary scattering in the same region of moduli space in which the classical black hole exists ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "when such configurations are smooth , horizonless solutions of supergravity , they are often referred to as _ microstate geometries _ because they represent microstates of the black hole both semi - classically and through the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that many of the microstates of the black hole will be dual to geometries that involve planck - scale details that go beyond the validity of the supergravity approximation . on the other hand",
    ", it is hoped that , within the validity of the supergravity approximation , one can find a suitably dense , representative sample of microstate geometries that will not only give a semi - classical picture of the microstates but also yield some of the thermodynamic details of the full system and perhaps even reproduce the entropy of the black hole .",
    "many such configurations have been constructed , both in supergravity and using non - back - reacted branes , but so far the entropy of the back - reacted configurations is not of the same order as that of black holes with similar charges @xcite .",
    "one of the common features of the geometries and brane configurations constructed so far is that they depend either on a finite number of parameters , or they come from putting arbitrarily - shaped supertubes in various three - charge geometries and thus depend on several functions of one variable .",
    "however , two of the authors have recently proposed @xcite that there may be bps string configurations that depend on functions of _ two _ variables , and these potentially have much more entropy than that of the the systems constructed so far .",
    "it is our purpose in this paper to present evidence that such brane configurations do indeed exist and that they preserve the same supersymmetries as those of the d1-d5-p black hole and are determined by several functions of _ two _ variables .",
    "we will refer to such objects as _ _ _ _ .    in section [ physdesc ]",
    "we describe exactly how and why can be constructed as smooth , @xmath8-bps solutions that depend upon two variables . in section",
    "[ sect : genbubbling ] we summarize how one can obtain and analyze the supersymmetries in a supertube transition .",
    "we have also included a much more systematic development of this process in the appendix . in section [",
    "sect : doublebubbling ] we combine two such supertube transitions to make the `` double bubbled ''  and examine its supersymmetry structure and substantiate the physical description of section [ physdesc ] .",
    "we then make some final remarks in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "to understand our approach to establishing the existence of  it is important to recall some of the defining properties of supertubes and the methods by which one can establish the existence of these arbitrary - shaped , supersymmetric configurations .    in string theory",
    "it is easy to create many species of two - charge , states by a simple superposition of compatible d - branes , momentum states or other solitons .",
    "each charge component is and compatibility means that the supersymmetry projectors for each charge commute with one another so that the two components do not interact .",
    "the resulting object is not really a new fundamental object in string theory , and without string corrections and back - reaction it is really only a marginally bound superposition of the two components .",
    "the transition to a supertube fuses these two components into a new _ fundamental _ bound state and this is achieved by giving the system an additional dipole moment and angular momentum in a transverse direction , so that the entire configuration follows a new and arbitrary profile transverse to the original progenitor configuration .",
    "the resulting object is still a state but very close to the supertube the supersymmetry is locally enhanced to . in other words , if the supertube profile were straight and the configuration were a flat sheet then it would be exactly with the preserved supersymmetries depending on the orientation of the sheet . for an arbitrary supertube profile the @xmath0 local supersymmetries depend upon the direction of the tangent to the profile , but there is always a set of @xmath9 _ common _ supersymmetries that are preserved independent of the profile , and these supersymmetries are precisely those of the original two - charge system before the supertube transition .",
    "thus one of the hallmarks of the supertube transition that distinguishes it from the progenitor two - charge superposition is the emergence of this local structure .",
    "every two - charge system has a supertube transition , and they can all be related by dualities .",
    "however , the physics underlying the supertube transition and the way the local structure emerges is different in different duality frames .",
    "one of the simplest supertubes has d0 and f1 `` electric '' charges dissolved in a rotating d2-brane @xcite .",
    "the , near - tube limit is simply an infinite , flat d2-brane and the easiest way to understand the emergence of the @xmath0 supersymmetries in this limit is to consider the m - theory uplift , in which the entire object a boosted m2-brane and the d0 and f1 charges correspond to momentum and winding around the eleventh dimension . as the orientation of the supertube changes , the set of @xmath0 supersymmetries varies but there is a common subset of @xmath9 supersymmetries that is preserved , independent of the orientation of the d2-brane .",
    "this subset of eight supersymmetries is precisely the common set of supersymmetries of the electric ( f1 and d0 ) charges of the underlying system .",
    "there is another very important feature of the supertube transition : in some duality frames it `` puffs up '' the brane by adding one dimension to the object but in other duality frames it does not .",
    "for example , the original d0-f1 system is intrinsically @xmath10-dimensional but the added dipole charge puffs it up to a @xmath11-dimensional d2 brane .",
    "similarly , the d1-d5 system has codimension @xmath1 , but adding the kkm dipole charge `` smears it out '' into a codimension @xmath12 object . on the other hand , from the perspective of m - theory the puffing up of the d0-f1 system to a d2 brane is simply a matter of tilting and boosting the @xmath11-dimensional m2 brane and there is no gain of dimension : in m - theory it is always a configuration of codimension @xmath9 .",
    "this is because the d0 charge is actually a momentum charge from the eleven - dimensional perspective , and tilting and boosting the brane momentum simply re - orients the surface and the momentum to create the dipole charge and angular momentum .",
    "this seems to be a general pattern : if one of the electric charges is a momentum then the corresponding supertube has the same codimension as the original object but if neither of the electric charges is a momentum then the supertube transition necessarily adds an extra dimension to the object , puffing it up so that the codimension of the brane configuration decreases by one .",
    "there are two basic approaches to establishing the existence of supertubes .",
    "first there are direct methods using either the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action or using supergravity .",
    "for example , for d0-f1 supertubes one can use the dbi action of a rotating d2 brane and induce the d0 and f1 charges using world - volume fields , or one can go to the t - dual of this supertube in which it is a d1 string with a momentum profile .",
    "alternatively , one can show that there exists a bps supergravity solution for any supertube profile .",
    "moreover , in the d1-d5 duality frame , this solution is smooth . both the dbi and the smooth d1-d5 supergravity descriptions yield the supersymmetry structure described above",
    "however , the problem with these direct methods is that they are usually difficult to implement because they involve analyzing the totality of the supertube or constructing a complicated supergravity solution .",
    "there are are also indirect , `` local '' methods that can be used to argue that a certain type of supertube exists . in this approach",
    "one imagines cutting the supertube into very small pieces , or zooming in very near some point of the tube .",
    "each such bit of the supertube will look , locally , like an infinite flat brane and will be a fundamental object .",
    "however , as the tangent to the supertube profile changes , the set of preserved supersymmetries will also change .",
    "the critical question is then whether there is a subset of common supersymmetries within all the sets of locally - preserved supersymmetries .",
    "put differently , the generic situation is that if one takes a brane and tilts it or puffs it up with some dipole charge , then there are no common supersymmetries that are preserved by both the original brane and the tilted or puffed up brane : the supersymmetries at different points on the profile are generically completely incompatible .",
    "the remarkable thing that distinguishes the supertube from the generic brane is that there is indeed a subset of common supersymmetries within the sets of locally - preserved supersymmetries and , by definition , this subset of common supersymmetries is independent of direction of the tangent to the supertube profile .",
    "the important point is that if one can establish that each infinitesimal bit of the supertube preserves some set of supersymmetries , and there is a common subset of these supersymmetries that are preserved by all the bits of supertube , then these separate supertube bits are mutually bps and so do not interact with each other .",
    "this strongly suggests that they can be strung together to form a supersymmetric , continuous profile of arbitrary shape .",
    "this perspective thus provides a local argument as to why the complicated supergravity configurations can , in fact , exist .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to apply the supertube process twice in succession ( hence `` double - bubbling '' ) and then use the supersymmetry analysis in a local argument to show that , in string theory , there exist fundamental bound - state configurations of branes that carry three electric charges , have several dipole moments , preserve @xmath1 supersymmetries , and are determined by a two - dimensional surface arbitrarily - embedded in @xmath13 .    these @xmath8-bps configurations , which we refer to as _ _ , can be thought of as being made of bits of infinite , flat two - dimensional surfaces , each bit preserving @xmath0 supersymmetries , of which @xmath1 supersymmetries are common to all the bits , and are the same as the @xmath1 supersymmetries common to bps objects carrying each of the the three electric charges of the .",
    "as the local argument implies , the fact that all the bits of the  are mutually means that the force between various bits of different orientation will be zero and so one should be able to assemble them into a  whose shape is given by five arbitrary functions of _ two _ variables .    the direct approach to finding these  would be to assemble various types of branes in string or m - theory , find the supersymmetries preserved by these configurations , and vary over all types of branes and all values of the brane densities until one finds a configuration that preserves the same killing spinors irrespective of two orientations . while this may indeed be possible , it is a technically formidable problem .",
    "our approach , using the doubling of the supertube transition , or double - bubbling , has several advantages in that it first enables us to identify what the charges and dipole charges of such a   should be , and then determine the conditions these must satisfy in order for the  to have an arbitrary shape .",
    "having achieved this , one then has a good starting point for tackling the far more strenuous and difficult supergravity analysis and solution .",
    "we will defer the latter to a subsequent paper .",
    "our starting point will be the d1-d5-p system familiar in the three - charge black hole story .",
    "we use this duality frame because it will lead to a smooth configuration .",
    "the first supertube transition will involve adding a dipole moment and angular momentum to take original d1-d5-p system to a three - charge two - dipole charge supertube .",
    "the shape of this generalized supertube is determined by a set of profile functions of one variable .",
    "as one approaches the location of the tube , the supergravity solution has a curvature singularity .",
    "if one now zooms in on this three - charge two - dipole charge supertube , or considers the infinite supertube limit , one finds that this infinite tube preserves _ eight _ supersymmetries , out of which four are the common supersymmetries associated with the component electric charges . since the infinite , flat supertube preserves @xmath9 supersymmetries",
    ", it should be a superposition of two mutually - bps branes and this is most easily seen in the d1-d5-p duality frame .    to make the first supertube transition of the d1 , d5 and p electric charges one first partitions the momentum between the d1 and d5 systems to obtain separate d1-p and d5-p systems .",
    "each of these then undergoes a supertube transition to objects we will refer to as d1-p and d5-p supertubes .",
    "the details of these transitions will be given later , for now it suffices to know that the d1-p and d5-p supertubes still carry the original charges but acquire angular momentum and d1 and d5 dipole moments respectively .",
    "a cartoon of the d1-p supertube is given in fig .",
    "if @xmath14 denotes the original common direction of the d1 and d5 branes , and @xmath15 is the coordinate along the new supertube profile in @xmath16 then the entire configuration now lies along a curve in the @xmath17-plane .",
    "we will denote the manifold consisting of the common direction of the d1 and d5 branes and the four transverse dimensions by @xmath18 and to keep things simple this manifold will be either @xmath13 or @xmath19 depending on whether we compactify the original brane direction or not .",
    "the three - charge supertube thus has codimension @xmath1 and is defined by a curve , @xmath20 , in @xmath18 .",
    "the d1 ( or d5 ) electric and dipole charges are then simply the @xmath14 and @xmath15 components of the total number of d1 ( or d5 ) branes .",
    "this geometric description immediately implies that the dipole and electric charges are related by : @xmath21 and this is precisely the relation required by either solving the dbi action or by requiring the absence of closed time - like curves in supergravity .",
    "it is important to remember that in making this supertube transition we have fused some of the momentum with the d1 branes and some of the momentum with the d5 branes .",
    "the result is parallel d1-p and d5-p supertubes that are each fundamental locally- objects and together preserve eight supersymmetries locally .",
    "indeed , the generalized `` supertube bit '' is simply a boosted and tilted superposition of d1 and d5 branes . at this point",
    "it also becomes clear why the three - charge supertube has a curvature singularity : this is simply the curvature singularity of a solution of superposed d1 and d5 branes in supergravity .",
    "it is also equally evident how to make a second supertube transition that fuses the coincident d1-p and d5-p supertubes described above into a new fundamental object that locally preserves @xmath0 supersymmetries : one applies a second supertube transition that involves adding a kkm dipole charge and angular momentum .",
    "locally , this is the same as the standard supertube transition of the d1-d5 system .",
    "it is important to remember that this transition decreases the codimension of the system , and because the d1-d5 common direction shrinks smoothly to zero at the kkm profile , the resulting configuration is smooth @xcite .",
    "hence , the puff - up into a codimension - three object _ completely resolves the singularity of the d1-d5 system .",
    "_    to be more specific , let @xmath22 denote the common direction of the d1 and d5 branes before puffing up and recall that there is , locally , a patch , @xmath23 , of @xmath16 transverse to the branes ( see fig .",
    "[ zoom ] ) . the smooth solution is obtained by introducing a kkm dipole charge along a closed path , @xmath24 , in @xmath23 and smearing the d1 and d5 charge along this path .",
    "we will parametrize the curve , @xmath24 , by an angle , @xmath25 , so the puffed up brane is a codimension @xmath12 object that sweeps out the @xmath26-plane .",
    "the resulting object is now described by the curve , @xmath24 , in @xmath23 and the three - dimensional transverse geometry in @xmath23 in the neighborhood of a point on @xmath24 , appears , at first sight , to be singular .",
    "however , it is a kaluza - klein monopole and if the @xmath22 direction is compactified with the proper periodicity then the kkm fiber shrinks to zero at a certain profile in @xmath16 in such a way that the resulting geometry is smooth .",
    "the second supertube transition thus has two very important effects : first , it completes the fusion of the d1-d5-p system into a true bound state by fusing the d1-p and d5-p supertubes into a single , locally object .",
    "secondly , it resolves the singularity of the generalized three - charge supertube through a kkm puffing _ at every point _ , @xmath22 , along the original profile , @xmath27 , of the first generalized supertube .",
    "this second supertube transition puffs the configuration up by one dimension along another arbitrary curve , @xmath28 , whose profile can depend upon @xmath22 .",
    "thus the resolution of the singularity allows the first ( arbitrary - shaped ) three - charge supertube profile to be replaced by a freely choosable curve , @xmath28 , at every point of the original profile : in other words , the original three - charge supertube can be puffed up into a two - dimensional sheet , or _",
    "stratum _ that has codimension @xmath12 in @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , since the profile of the second puff up is freely choosable _ at every point _ of the original profile , the resulting sheet , or stratum , is defined by a freely choosable function , @xmath29 , of two variables into the @xmath18 .",
    "this map defines the  and it will be a smooth , @xmath8-bps configuration that emerges from `` double bubbling . ''",
    "the solution is locally but globally has the electric charges of , and the same supersymmetries as , the d1-d5-p system and carries several dipole charges corresponding to transverse d1 and d5 branes and kk - monopoles .",
    "the foregoing argument and lays out precisely the construction that leads to the  and the process is depicted in fig .",
    "[ superstratum ]",
    ". however , to substantiate the claim that  can have a completely arbitrary two - dimensional shape and still preserve four supersymmetries , we need to complete the `` local argument '' and show that each locally - flat two - dimensional surface bit that makes a   preserves @xmath0 supersymmetries , and that collectively the bits preserve a common subset of four supersymmetries .",
    "this will be done in the next two sections .",
    "once this is established , it follows that all the surface bits are mutually bps and hence non - interacting and therefore they can be combined make a complete two - dimensional . of course , to fully establish the existence of a  we either need to find a born - infeld - like description or to construct its complete supergravity solution .",
    "we leave this somewhat daunting task for future work .",
    "we will consider several examples of supertube transitions and their effect upon the structure of the supersymmetries .",
    "if @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the original electric charges corresponding to some branes and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the dipole charge and angular momentum of the supertube configuration , then we will use the following canonical notation to denote the supertube construction : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath25 are some subsets of coordinate directions along which the branes are wrapped or the momentum is directed .",
    "the coordinate , @xmath25 , will generically indicate the new direction associated with the supertube .",
    "our purpose here is to find the supersymmetries preserved by the supertubes by constructing a one - parameter family of projectors whose null spaces intersect over and define the subspace of supersymmetries that are preserved by the particular supertube configuration .",
    "there is a standard procedure for computing the required supersymmetry projectors : one starts with the projectors appropriate to the electric charges , @xmath30 and @xmath31 and uses carefully selected rotation matrices that tilt and boost the brane configuration along the supertube directions .",
    "the end result is a projector that satisfies three conditions : ( i ) it must be a linear combination of projectors for all the underlying branes and momenta , ( ii ) it must define a @xmath36-bps state ( for fixed @xmath35 and @xmath25 ) and so have sixteen null vectors , and ( iii ) it must be a linear combination of the original projectors associated with the electric branes .",
    "the first condition simply stipulates that the supertube has the required brane constituents and the second condition implies that the infinite planar supertube is @xmath36-bps and preserves @xmath0 supersymmetries . if the orientation , @xmath25 , of the supertube varies then the set of sixteen supersymmetries also varies , however the last condition guarantees that no matter how the orientation varies the supertube will always preserve the original eight common supersymmetries associated with the electric charges and so the supertube can have an arbitrary profile and still be a @xmath37-bps state .",
    "it turns out that these constraints are enough to determine the requisite projectors for a supertube configuration and so we will use this approach to derive all the projectors we need . a more formal and precise derivation of the validity of our projectors can be found in the appendix where we also summarize the dictionary that defines the @xmath36-bps projectors associated with each and every type of brane charge .      to illustrate some basic properties of the supertube transition",
    ", we consider the f1p system .",
    "this system is described in considerably more detail in appendix  [ sssapp : f1p ] .",
    "the starting point is a certain number of fundamental strings stretched in the @xmath38-direction .",
    "these fundamental strings preserve half of the supersymmetries , namely those that obey @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the third pauli matrix which acts on the doublet of majorana - weyl supercharges of the type ii superstring theory .    to generate the f1-p system , we consider an arbitrary transverse direction , denoted by @xmath25 , and t - dualize the system along a direction in the @xmath42-plane that makes an angle , @xmath43 , with the @xmath38-axis . under this t - duality ,",
    "the system remains .",
    "it is not very important in this discussion whether the direction along which we t - dualize is compact or not .",
    "if it is not compact , what we are doing is not a symmetry of the theory but it can be viewed as a solution - generating operation .    to find the supercharges that are preserved after the t - duality , we ( trivially )",
    "rewrite the projector in components parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the t - duality axis : @xmath44 t - duality parallel to fundamental strings converts them into momentum , and the supersymmetries preserved by momentum are determined by the same projector as for fundamental strings but without the @xmath41 .",
    "thus the projector we get after the t - duality is simply : @xmath45 and this describes the projector for the bound state of momentum along the t - duality axis with some fundamental strings in the orthogonal direction . by construction , this projector describes a system .",
    "if we start with @xmath46 coincident fundamental strings , the resulting system has ( f , p)-charges given by @xmath47 in the @xmath38-direction , and ( f , p)-charges @xmath48 in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "the remarkable feature of this new system is that it preserves a fixed set of eight supercharges regardless of the choice of the direction @xmath25 and the angle @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath49 we have momentum in the @xmath38-direction , and for @xmath50 we have fundamental strings in the @xmath38 direction , so the eight supercharges are the same as the eight supercharges preserved by parallel fundamental strings and momentum in the @xmath38-direction .",
    "indeed , we can write @xmath51 which clearly demonstrates that the common supersymmetries of a marginal bound state of fundamental strings and momentum in the @xmath38-direction are always preserved .",
    "for all this to work it is crucial that the amount of f1-string charge and momentum is correlated with the angle @xmath43 . without this correlation",
    "the configuration would have no remaining supersymmetry .    by gluing together pieces of fundamental strings and momentum that locally look like the above f1p system",
    ", we can make a @xmath37-bps f1p supertube which is the s - dual of the d1-p supertube shown in fig .",
    "[ zoom ] .      consider the bubbling @xmath52 in this configuration the special direction of the kkm lies along the common direction , @xmath14 , of the d1d5 system and after bubbling the charges and kkm dipole are distributed along the closed curve parametrized by @xmath25 .",
    "this is therefore a true `` puffing up '' in that the configuration has gained an extra dimension defined by @xmath25 .    before bubbling",
    ", the electric projectors are ( see the appendix for details ) : @xmath53 and these two projectors commute .",
    "bubbling combines these and adds a momentum part , @xmath54 , and a kkm part , @xmath55 .",
    "one can then show that the bubbled projector can be written in either of the three following ways @xmath56 the first expression , ( [ bubbproj1a ] ) , shows the underlying rotations and middle expression , ( [ bubbproj1b ] ) , shows that the projector is , indeed , a combination of the projectors for component branes .",
    "the second term in ( [ bubbproj1a ] ) squares to @xmath57 and is traceless , and hence @xmath58 preserves sixteen supersymmetries .",
    "the third expression , ( [ bubbproj1c ] ) , shows that these sixteen supersymmetries include the eight supersymmetries in the common nullspace of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that these expressions are very similar to the expressions obtained for the f1p system described above , as they should be because the two systems are dual to one another .",
    "thus this projector has a sixteen - dimensional null space that depends upon the orientation of the supertube through the appearance of @xmath61 .",
    "the projectors , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , are independent of @xmath61 and so their eight - dimensional common null space is independent of the supertube orientation and shape . as a result ,",
    "if the supertube is an infinite flat sheet then @xmath25 has a constant orientation and it is @xmath36-bps but if the supertube has a varying orientation , or shape , then it is still a @xmath37-bps configuration .      in the d1p and d5p systems ,",
    "one of the electric charges is a momentum and so the bubbling to a supertube does not `` puff up '' the supertube because the final supertube configuration has the same dimension as the original electric configuration .",
    "the supertube is rather a `` superhelix , '' and the tilt and boost of the electric charges along a transverse direction , @xmath15 , convert some of the d - brane charge into dipole charge and some of the momentum into angular momentum .",
    "thus we have : @xmath62 indeed , there is an underlying tilt angle , @xmath43 , that determines how the charges are realigned after tilting : @xmath63 note that ( [ 3chgc ] ) differs from the first two equations essentially because the momentum is perpendicular to the branes just as we had in the f1p system .",
    "notice that @xmath64 here should be thought of as the momentum in the negative @xmath15-direction .",
    "the fundamental projectors associated with this system are : @xmath65 the projectors associated with these two supertube transitions are @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath68 are given in ( [ 3chga ] ) , ( [ 3chgb ] ) and ( [ 3chgc ] ) .    in both of these equations ,",
    "the middle expressions show that the projectors are a combination of the appropriate component parts .",
    "the second term in each of ( [ bubbproj2a ] ) and ( [ bubbproj3a ] ) squares to @xmath57 and is traceless , and hence each projector preserves sixteen supersymmetries .",
    "the expressions ( [ bubbproj2c ] ) and ( [ bubbproj3c ] ) show that each of these new projectors can be expressed in terms of the original projectors of the d1p system or d5p systems respectively .",
    "the projectors @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath69 all commute with one another and are independent of @xmath70 and so their nullspaces are independent of the supertube orientation and shape . as a result ,",
    "if the supertube is an infinite flat sheet then @xmath15 has a constant orientation and the supertube is @xmath36-bps but if the supertube has a varying orientation , or shape , then it is still a @xmath37-bps configuration .",
    "we now consider the d1d5p system and consider it to be a superposition of the d1p and the d5p systems considered above with the momentum partitioned into two parallel parts , @xmath71 associated with the two different sets of branes .",
    "the first supertube is then obtained by tilting and boosting both sets of branes in exactly the same manner : @xmath72 the charges of the system are then given by ( [ 3chga])([3chgc ] ) and the angular momentum is similarly decomposable into two parts , @xmath73 .    locally , the picture of these supertubes is one where d1 and d5 branes are tilted and have some momentum in the transverse direction .",
    "the momentum has to be distributed in such a way that the d1 and d5-branes remain parallel , so locally the split in momenta between the d1 and d5-branes is not arbitrary but determined by the ratio of the tensions of the d1 and wrapped d5-branes .",
    "this produces a three - charge , two - dipole - charge supertube that follows the trajectory defined by @xmath15 .",

    "the `` quick and dirty '' way to achieve this is to essentially replace @xmath59 and @xmath60 in ( [ bubbproj1c ] ) with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "since the fundamental branes associated with three - charge , two - dipole - charge supertube are tilted and lie along the @xmath22-direction , one must also replace the @xmath82 s in ( [ bubbproj1c ] ) with @xmath83 s .",

    "we have thus completed the local argument that strongly suggests that our conjectured  should exist as a regular solution in string theory .",
    "we have shown that there should exist a completely new set of bound states of d - branes , namely , .",
    "these have three electric charges and globally preserve @xmath1 supersymmetries while locally appear to be objects preserving @xmath0 supersymmetries .",

    "the fact that these microstate geometries depend on functions of two variables leads us to expect that they will be able to account for vastly more entropy than ordinary supertubes , whose shapes only depend upon functions of one variable .",
    "the new bound states should describe particular degrees of freedom of the d1-d5-p system , which one may hope to be able to see either by studying the appropriate microscopics or by relating normalizable modes of the supergravity solution , when it is constructed , to the various expectation values of the dual theory ( as was done for simpler systems in @xcite ) . while the second method may indeed yield interesting physical information",

    "while the arguments in this paper strongly suggest that  exist , there are still some serious calculations to be done to prove their existence . of course",
    ", ideally one should construct a fully - back - reacted supergravity solution that depends on five functions of two variables and has the charges and the dipole charges indicated in this paper . in fact , two special limits of this would - be solution have already been constructed in the literature . as we explained in section [ physdesc ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ superstratum ] , the  can be thought as coming from a smooth d1-d5 supertube with a kkm dipole charge to which one adds momentum - carrying modes that break the isometry along the common d1-d5 direction .",
    "a perturbative solution in which _ one _ unit of momentum is added to the smooth d1-d5 supertube was constructed in @xcite , and the rather non - trivial matchings that insured the existence of that solution make us confident that more complicated  solutions exist .",
    "a second highly - non - trivial supergravity solution that can be thought of as a limit of a  was obtained in @xcite by spectrally - flowing a supertube of arbitrary shape .",
    "the resulting solution depends non - trivially both on the common d1-d5 direction and on one of the angles in the base , but this dependence is `` the same '' in that this solution is a  whose function of two variables only depends on their sum but not on their difference .",
    "given the existence of these non - trivial limit solutions , and given that the physical description provided in this paper gives a rather precise description of its charges and dipole moments , we believe the complete construction of the supergravity  solution to be within reach .",
    "there are , however , some potential issues that might arise in this construction . first , our local argument is based upon the fact that bps bits of the stratum will not interact , since they are mutually bps , and so can be assembled at will into the .",
    "this is not exactly true : multi - charge bps configurations _ do _ interact if they are not mutually local and must satisfy bubble equations or integrability conditions that constrain their locations .",
    "however , we do not expect this to be a problem because there is still freedom to adjust some of the electric charge and angular momentum densities so as to accommodate the freedom to adjust the relative locations of the bits of .",
    "put differently , we expect any such conditions not to emerge as restrictions on the shape but to constrain , for a given shape , certain integrals of the charge and angular - momentum densities ( much as one finds for wiggly supertubes in bubbling solutions @xcite ) .",
    "another delicate issue that might constrain the  is the fact that one must compactify the common d1-d5 direction , @xmath22 , and have a properly quantized coefficient of the potential along this @xmath95 fiber in order to smooth out the geometry using the kk monopole .",
    "this works beautifully for the usual d1-d5 configuration where @xmath22 is simply the coordinate along a compactification circle . for ,",
    "the coordinate @xmath22 parametrizes a curve of arbitrary shape and so there may be an issue in making the kkm construction smooth on such a geometry .",
    "once again we suspect that this will not present a problem because the process of adding charges and smearing them out includes some choices of charge density functions and this geometric issue should simply amount to selecting the kkm density distribution so that it is a fixed integer along the curve defined by @xmath22 .",
    "we raise these issues to show that the complete proof of the existence of  as microstate geometries still requires some further work . indeed",
    ", the supergravity solutions corresponding to  will be extremely interesting .",
    "one should recall that , from the six - dimensional perspective , the smooth geometry created by the d1-d5 supertube is simply a non - trivial cycle in the three - dimensional homology of the space - time and that the usual supertube profile represents fluctuations of this @xmath12-cycle that depend upon functions of one variable .",
    "the  will thus represent the much richer and more extensive space of two - dimensional fluctuations of this @xmath12-cycle .",
    "we are thus very optimistic about these new solutions and the role that we expect them to play in black - hole thermodynamics .",
    "the local construction of the  has revealed some particularly satisfying properties .",
    "first , they seem to be the most natural fundamental bound - state constituent of a three - charge black hole .",
    "the two - charge supertube is a simple fusion of two electric charges to form a fundamental bound object and much of the work of mathur and collaborators has shown how these objects naturally carry the entropy of the two - charge system .",
    "once one has a three - charge system we now find that there is a very natural `` double bubbling '' that leads to a fundamental , bound object that carries all three charges and by very good fortune these configurations depend upon functions of two variables . while supertubes and generalized supertubes may account for some of the entropy of the three - charge black hole , they are not really fundamentally three - charge objects whereas the new  is precisely such an object and should carry far more entropy for large @xmath96 ( using two - dimensional cft notation ) , which would still be smaller than the cardy result @xmath97 . it will be interesting to see whether  respect this entropy bound , or can evade it because of their non - perturbative dipole charges . ] .",
    "we find it remarkable that such an object emerges precisely when the three - charge entropy seems to require it and its doubly remarkable that this object can be represented in terms of a microstate geometry .    in this paper",
    ", we studied the possibility of a particular two - fold supertube transition of the d1-d5-p system .",
    "namely , at the first stage of the transition , the d1 and p charges are transformed into a tilted d1-p system and the d5 and p charges into a tilted d5-p system .",
    "then , at the second stage , these tilted d1-p and d5-p systems are puffed up into a . however , since the d1 , d5 and p charges can be dualized into each other , at the first stage we could have also considered the possibility of the d1 and d5 charges forming a supertube with kkm dipole charge , which in turn could have also participated in the second transition .",
    "it is not clear whether such different patterns of two - fold supertube transitions give the same final result , and if not , whether the resulting configuration could still source a smooth geometry .",

    "the supercharges preserved by various fundamental branes and solitons satisfy @xmath117 where the matrices , @xmath118 , are given by @xcite : @xmath119 from these conditions , one can reverse - engineer the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "for example , one can show that the f1 condition in means that we have the following terms on the right hand side of the @xmath120 anticommutator : @xmath121 where @xmath122 corresponds to the charge of fundamental strings .",
    "one can show this as follows .",
    "if we have straight fundamental strings at rest , the supersymmetry algebra becomes @xmath123 the charge vector @xmath124 measures the tension of the fundamental string , including the direction and multiplicity .",

    "equivalently , one has : @xmath127 the superchage @xmath112 satisfies the following relation : @xmath128 which vanishes for a bps configuration of mass @xmath129 .",

    "the essential point is that ( [ susyalg1 ] ) becomes the projector ( [ hpe3aug10 ] ) precisely on the bps states and , conversely the supersymmetry algebra must be compatible with the projectors that define states .      another instructive exercise is to derive the linear combination of supersymmetries that vanishes on states with particular combinations of charges .",

    "[ d1d5p - tube ] .    to derive the projectors for this tilted - and - boosted d1-d5 system",
    ", we follow a similar path to that of section [ apsc : genericsupertube ] to derive the projector for the f1-p system .",
    "namely , we begin by considering a configuration with d1(@xmath14 ) , d5(1234@xmath14 ) , and p(@xmath15 ) charges ; namely , the branes are aligned with the @xmath14 direction and have momentum along the @xmath15 direction .",
    "we first construct the projectors for this configuration aligned with the @xmath14- and @xmath15-axes .",
    "then , we will simply rotate the configuration in the @xmath277 plane and obtain the desired projectors for the tilted - and - boosted d1-d5 system .    as we discussed in the main text",
    ", one can view the whole process as two separate supertube transitions of the d1-p and d5-p systems , so that the end result is two locally - parallel and marginally bound supertubes .",
    "if we simply boost the d1 and d5 projectors of in the @xmath278 direction then we trivially get the two commuting projectors : @xmath279 where @xmath280 . to convert these into the canonical forms of projectors , as in , from which we can read off the component charges , we multiply the first one by @xmath281 and the second one by @xmath282 and rescale by @xmath283 to obtain the projectors : @xmath284 where the angle , @xmath285 , is related to the boost by @xmath286 , @xmath287 . however , the problem with these projectors is that they no longer commute with each other , even though they are equivalent to the original set of projectors .",

    "the resolution of this dilemma is to consider instead the following more general class of projectors : @xmath288&=0,\\qquad   c_i=\\cos\\alpha_i,\\qquad s_i=\\sin\\alpha_i,\\qquad i=1,2 , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the angles , @xmath289 , will be determined below .",
    "note that , as desired , these projectors _ commute _ with each other . on the other hand , they now contain @xmath290 terms , which correspond to kkm(@xmath291 ) charges and may seem unwanted . however , these terms are actually acceptable if the charges represented by @xmath292 and the ones represented by @xmath293 add up to the charges that we want in the system .",
    "namely , the @xmath290 terms cause no problem at all if the _ net _",
    "kkm(@xmath291 ) charge vanishes .",
    "there are several reasons for considering this more general class of projectors .",
    "the most important one is that if one is to decompose the boosted d1-d5 system , which preserves 8 supersymmetries , into two sub - systems with commuting projectors , each of which preserves 16 supersymmetries , then the charges of these sub - systems are _ not _ those of a boosted d1 and a boosted d5 , as one may naively expect .",
    "actually , to get _ commuting _ projectors in the canonical form determined by , one finds that one must include a @xmath290 term which corresponds to a kkm(@xmath266 ) charge .",
    "we can derive this as follows .",
    "if we dualize the d1(@xmath14)-d5(@xmath294)-p(@xmath15 ) system by @xmath295-dualities , we can convert it into d2(23 ) , d2(14 ) , d2(13 ) . then , after an @xmath296 rotation , we can go to a frame only with d2(@xmath297 ) and d2(@xmath298 ) .",
    "these two stacks of d2-branes are mutually bps and their projectors commute , and hence are the one - charge subsystems of our two - charge system .",
    "if we take each sub - system and @xmath299 rotate it back , it now has d2(24 ) in addition to d2(23 ) , d2(14 ) , d2(13 ) .",
    "if we further dualize it back to the d1-d5-p frame , we obtain two mutually bps sub - systems , each having kkm(@xmath300 ) charge in addition to the original d1(@xmath14 ) , d5(@xmath294 ) and p(@xmath15 ) charge .",
    "hence , from this perspective , having an extra kkm(@xmath266 ) charge is a necessity , not an option .",
    "another way to arrive at the projectors above is to ask what are the most general commuting projectors with the charges of the system .",
    "clearly the the projectors can contain @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath301 because they respectively correspond to the d1(@xmath14 ) , d5(@xmath294 ) and p(@xmath15 ) charges .",
    "however , one can also add @xmath290 ( corresponding to kkm(@xmath266 ) ) , which commutes with the other charges , as long as the kkm charge of the total system is zero .",
    "hence , our goal is to decompose the d1(@xmath14)-d5(@xmath294)-p(@xmath15 ) system into two mutually bps sub - systems each of which is , whose projectors commute , and whose kkm charges sum up to zero .",
    "yet another heuristic way of thinking of our choice of projector is that it is the most general projector carrying these charges that does not , at leading order in rotations , involve a direct mix of the d1 and d5 sub - systems .",
    "the most general projector is obtained by taking four arbitrary coefficients , @xmath302 , for the gamma matrices on the right - hand side of one of the projectors . to be a projector one must have @xmath303 and",
    "so there is a three - parameter family .",
    "however , if one excludes the direct rotation of the d1 system into the d5 system at first order , and requires the two projectors to commute , one arrives at the result in    we now fix the angles , @xmath289 , in terms of the physical parameters .",
    "each of the projectors @xmath304 corresponds to a sub - system with four kinds of charges , d1(@xmath14 ) , d5(@xmath294 ) , p(@xmath15 ) and kkm(@xmath264 ) .",

    "much like for ordinary two - charge supertubes , the fact that the angular momentum density is equal to the sum of the dipole charge densities insures that the shifts to the electric killing spinors brought about by the dipole charges and angular momentum cancel ; this can also be seen from supergravity analysis of the near - supertube solution @xcite .    the projectors @xmath351 and @xmath352 defined here are not the same as those defined in . this is because the projectors constructed here actually commute whereas those of",

    "however , before the second bubbling these densities must in fact satisfy _ two _ constraints , which imply that d1 and the d5 densities must be proportional .",

    "one the other hand , from the point of view of the dbi construction @xcite this relation is an intrinsic feature of the three - charge two - dipole charge supertube that undergoes the second bubbling to become a , and hence one can argue that the  will continue satisfying this relation .",
    "the final answer to this question has to await a dynamical description of a either via a supergravity solution or via a born - infeld - type analysis .",
    "the important point is that the one or two density parameters that can vary along the , together with the shape modes that give its embedding in @xmath18 , can be functions of both @xmath15 and @xmath25 .",

    "<S> we argue that there exists a new class of completely smooth , three - charge bound state configurations that depend upon arbitrary functions of _ two variables_. these configurations are locally objects in that if they form an infinite flat sheet then they preserve @xmath0 supersymmetries but even with arbitrary two - dimensional shape modes they still preserve @xmath1 supersymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> they have three electric charges and can be thought of the result of two successive supertube transitions that involve adding two independent dipole moments and giving rise to the arbitrary two - dimensional shape modes . </S>",
    "<S> we further argue that in the d1-d5-p duality frame this construction will give rise to smooth , horizonless solutions , or microstate geometries . </S>",
    "<S> we expect these solutions to be extremely important in the semi - classical and holographic descriptions of black - hole entropy .    </S>",
