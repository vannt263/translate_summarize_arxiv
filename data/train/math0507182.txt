    "in his work on metastable homotopy groups @xcite , mahowald introduced an invariant that associates to every element @xmath5 in the stable stems a new element @xmath6 called the _ root invariant _ of @xmath5 .",
    "the construction has indeterminacy and so @xmath6 is in general only a coset .",
    "the main result of @xcite indicates a deep relationship between elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres which are root invariants and their behavior in the ehp spectral sequence .",
    "mahowald and ravenel conjecture in @xcite that , loosely speaking , the root invariant of a @xmath7-periodic element is @xmath8-periodic .",
    "thus the root invariant is related simultaneously to unstable and chromatic phenomena .",
    "the conjectural relationship between root invariants and the chromatic filtration is based partly on computational evidence .",
    "for instance , at the prime @xmath2 , we have @xcite , @xcite @xmath9 while at odd primes we have @xcite , @xcite @xmath10 demonstrating that the root invariant sends @xmath11-periodic families to @xmath3-periodic families .",
    "for @xmath12 it is also known @xcite , @xcite that @xmath13 and @xmath14 these computations led the authors of @xcite to regard the root invariants as _ defining _ the @xmath15 greek letter elements as the root invariants of the @xmath16 greek letter elements when the relevant smith - toda complexes do not exist .",
    "other evidence of the root invariant raising chromatic filtration is seen in the cohomology of the steenrod algebra .",

    "the root invariant is defined using the tate spectrum of the sphere spectrum , so the results of the papers listed above provide even more evidence that the root invariant of a @xmath7-periodic element should be @xmath7-torsion .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new variant of the root invariant called the _ filtered root invariant_. we apply the filtered root invariant towards the computation of some new root invariants at the prime  @xmath4 in low dimensions .",
