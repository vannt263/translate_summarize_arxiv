    "in the early stages of the formation of a star ( see , e.g. , the review paper of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a cloud of gas and dust collapses and forms a protostar with a disk surrounding it .",
    "later on , while the accretion from the cloud continues , the star / disk system also begins to eject matter into outflows whose strength varies in time . finally , accretion and outflow cease and over the next few million years the star loses its disk and evolves onto the main sequence .",
    "a major refinement of this paradigm has been an exploration of the parameter space for which multiple objects form from a single collapse ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamical evolution of multiple systems , once they are formed , remains insufficiently well understood however .",
    "observations @xcite have shown that in fact more stars in low mass star forming regions ( e.g. the taurus star forming region ) are found in binary or higher order multiple systems than is the case for older systems like the field stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "further , nearly all of these stars show evidence for circumstellar disks .",
    "the existence of such multiple stars in forming systems suggests that the evolution of circumstellar material in orbit around or infalling onto those stars will be significantly altered from the evolution in a single star@xmath0disk system .",
    "several observed binary star@xmath0disk systems do in fact show evidence of mutual interactions of various strengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the l1551",
    "irs  5 system for example , in which the observed angular separation on the sky corresponds to a @xmath550  au physical separation , disks around each component of the binary are truncated at about 10  au , a size which is far smaller than is typically observed in single systems or in binaries with larger orbital separations ( e.g. that observed in the hk  tau system ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to disk truncation , tidal interactions due to the companion star can significantly alter the evolution of the circumstellar disks by generating large scale shocks and other internal heating .",
    "these factors act to accelerate mass transport through the disk , significantly reducing its lifetime unless that mass is replenished from a circumbinary disk on a similar timescale . such heating and transport may negatively influence the formation of planets in binary systems , as described in @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes significantly more complex when the binary system is also surrounded by a circumbinary torus and/or disk .",
    "this additional player may exchange mass and angular momentum with each star and its disk , affecting both the binary orbit and the mass evolution of the circumstellar disks .",
    "for example , their dispersal due to accretion onto the star , enhanced by the binary perturbations , may be slowed by continued replenishment from circumbinary material .",
    "if this reservoir is massive enough , the feeding mechanism may extend the lifetime of the inner disks so that their dissipation timescale is not significantly different from to single stars ( @xcite , see also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "evidence for such replenishment has recently been observed with using high resolution interferometry on alma @xcite .",
    "the total number of observed circumbinary disks is not large . of those ,",
    "most are found in binaries with a small separations , such as gw  ori , dq  tau , ak  sco , v4046  sgr @xcite .",

    "later observations of @xcite , using speckle interferometry , confirmed this observation and set the projected separation between the components to be @xmath10 .",
    "the same observations also resolved both the primary and secondary components into a binaries .",
    "imaging by @xcite , refined the distance measurements , setting projected separations of 0.25  and 1.48   between the components of the a and b binaries respectively , and 10.1  between the hierarchical binary pairs . at an assumed 140  pc distance of taurus , these separations correspond to distances of @xmath11  au and @xmath12  au , for the binaries , and a distance of @xmath13  au , for the hierarchical pairs .",
    "the much more massive ` primary ' component of the system , , has received extensive attention since its discovery , and a progressively more detailed picture of the system has emerged .",
    "measurements have been made of the stellar masses , luminosities and spectral types , their age , accretion rates , their relative motions and orbit characteristics , the mass and mass distribution of the circumbinary ring and disk and its rotation curve , and estimates of the circumstellar disk configurations and substructure ( an incomplete list of references includes * ? ? ?",

    "is composed of two components , consisting of a ring or torus and a disk with a combined mass of @xmath14 , of which some 70% of the total is contained in the torus .",
    "both the torus inner and outer edges are quite sharp , with edges @xmath15  au in width , and are located at distances of 180 and 260  au from the apparent system center , respectively . assuming that the torus is circular , its inclination is determined from the observed projected image to be 37 degrees .",
    "the disk component is fit to a rather steep power law in density with exponent @xmath16 , and a similarly steep power law in temperature with exponent @xmath17 .",
    "the disk s outer edge is not as well resolved , but appears to extend to approximately 800  au , a distance consistent with tidal truncation due to the b components of the combined quadruple system .",
    "kinematic measurements of the circumbinary material constrain the total mass of the a components to be 1.28@xmath180.07 .",
    "unresolved emission originating from the circumstellar environment sets a lower limit on the mass of such material to be @xmath19 .",
    "the wealth of observations of   is not without inconsistencies , based both in the data themselves , and in attempts to fit theoretical models to it .",
    "for example , while the combined mass of the ` a ' components has been determined ( as noted above ) to be @xmath20  , the masses of the two stars have been estimated from their spectral signatures to be @xmath21   and @xmath22for the primary and secondary , respectively , based on spectroscopic measurements and fits to evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "much of the question regarding the system masses may be resolved with the recent discovery of @xcite , that the secondary , gg  tau  ab , is itself a close binary with separation of @xmath23  au and masses estimated to be 0.38 @xmath24 amd 0.250.35 @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the orbital parameters of the stars have been established from fits to their relative motions , and are estimated to define an orbit with semi - major axis @xmath25  au and eccentricity @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "these parameters appear to be inconsistent with the expectations of theoretical models which predict a semi - major axis @xmath27  au @xcite based on the positions of various orbital resonances and the @xmath5180  au inner diameter of the circumbinary disk .",
    "@xcite explored this discrepancy in an analysis of their results , noting that with a slightly increased error bar on the system s observed inclination , an alternate fit to the data yield a semimajor axis of 62  au and an eccentricity of 0.35 .",
    "this orbit is consistent with the dynamical constraints implied by the inner disk edge location and with the observed projected separation of @xmath28  au ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our goals in this work are to understand the dynamical influences that the disks and stars in a forming multiple star system have on each other , what their observational consequences are and to make inferences regarding the physical characteristics and behavior of the system based on the outcomes of numerical simulations .",
    "to those ends , we will present a series of two dimensional numerical simulations configured to model systems like , using the numerical code vine .",
    "the  system is interesting because of the depth and quality of the observations made of it , which permit it to serve as representative of a larger class of objects in which there are significant dynamical interactions between the various components",
    ". our strategy will be largely qualitative in nature and will focus on comparisons between the observations and simulations modeling a range of plausible physical conditions for the system .",
    "comparisons of features seen in the simulations with those in the observations will then permit us to rule out or confirm various physical properties of the system , by virtue of being consistent ( or not ) with those observations , and to assign their origin to specific physical phenomena active in the system .",
    "the presence and characteristics of the binary will have influences on the circumstellar and circumbinary materials at all scales .",
    "as noted above however , the orbital parameters of the  binary are not yet uniquely defined by observations , so the characteristics of the influence are likewise not uniquely determined .",
    "therefore , a logical starting point for our explorations will be to study the spectrum of outcomes that different orbital parameters may produce in the behavior of the gaseous material in the system . with this in mind , our strategy will be to run a suite of simulations in which each member consists of the same circumbinary initial condition and physical model , but stars with different orbit parameters .",
    "each member of the suite will then define a unique numerical experiment to display the consequences that a particular set of binary orbit parameters have for the system behavior , and which characteristics are common to all members of the suite . given the simulation results ,",
    "we can make assessments in terms of comparisons of the appearance of the various gaseous components to the observations .",
    "in particular , we will address three broad categories of questions appropriate for the evolution at different spatial scales .",
    "first , what are the influences of the binary on the large scale structure of the circumbinary material and what structures develop from independently of the binary ?",
    "second , what are the influences of the binary on the circumstellar material and the material ` in transition ' between the circumbinary and circumstellar regions ?",
    "third , what are the likely orbit parameters of the binary ?",
    "we begin in section [ sec : binphys ] with specifications of the initial conditions , the physical models and the numerical methods used to simulate their evolution .",
    "then , in section [ sec : evo - circumbin ] , we introduce the suite of models that form the basis of our study and describe the evolution of each of the systems at large scales . in section [ sec : evo - circumstar ] , we revisit many of these same simulations , but turn our focus towards the smaller scale characteristics of the circumstellar environment .",
    "we will find that many of the results described in these two sections are relevant to more than one of the questions just noted .",
    "we therefore limit our initial discussion to the various characteristics of the simulations themselves , with limited reference to particular observations .",
    "then , in section [ sec : compare ] , we compare our results to the observed  system .",
    "there , we focus first on assessing their consistency with the observations in order to rule out less likely configurations , and then on assessing the results for their physical significance , i.e. , what the models may reveal about the physical state and the evolution of the system . finally , in [ sec :",
    "discussion ] , we summarize our results , comparing them to previous work and discussing a number of questions which may be of interest to address in the future .      as a guide to the reader , we briefly introduce the various numerical experiments and the goals we set for them .",
    "we introduce the main suite of simulations and begin our characterization of the evolution at large spatial scales in sections [ sec : eccentric ] and [ sec : circular ] . a similar introduction to many of the same simulations appears in section [ sec : circstar - conf ] , where we concentrate on the smaller scale , circumstellar evolution .",
    "these sections will focus on exploring the morphology of large and small scale structures developing under the tidal force of the central stellar system .    at large scales ,",
    "the presence of a binary affects the evolution of the torus by continuously stirring the material , generating morphological features in response , and by heating it .",
    "also , in the specific example of the  torus , where the observed temperature and mass imply that it is susceptible to gravitational instabilities , we expect that features due to such instabilities to develop as well .",
    "as noted above ,  is known to harbor assymmetries and other features within its torus . given these features , our first analyses will be qualitative : are any similar features identifiable in our simulations ?",
    "we address this question in section [ sec : torus - features ] .    after finding qualitative correspondence between features in the observed and simulated systems",
    ", we turn to investigations to couple the physical processes that are active in the system with the features they are responsible for producing .",
    "the most striking feature of the  circumbinary material is that it is composed of two very distinct components : a torus and a disk , with a sharp boundary distinguishing them from each other . in section [ sec :",
    "transport ] , we test the possibility that these two components actually have a common origin as a single primordial torus , out of which the disk forms as an ` excretion ' feature generated by the outward mass transport driven by the propagation of spiral arms .",
    "we run simulations initially configured to include only a torus , in order to compare the behavior of such systems to the torus@xmath0disk systems already studied , focusing specifically on the relative efficiency of outward mass transport and the resulting circumbinary mass distribution .",
    "we continue with a study to determine the relative importance of various sources of heating in the torus .",
    "this question is important because of its bearing on the susceptibility of the torus to fragment . depending on its characteristics ,",
    "if indeed any fragmenation occurs , such fragmentation may lead to the formation of additional planetary , brown dwarf or stellar components of the system . in section [ sec : heatoff ] , we describe the behavior of two simulations in which we suppress , respectively , the radiative heating from the stars and the internal heating due to the dissipation of shocks generated both by the tidal action of the binary and self gravitating instabilities .",
    "we will expect changes in the behavior of the evolution if in fact either of these heating sources are important .",
    "the physical significance of our results depends critically on having both an accurate inventory of the important physical processes and an accurate numerical realization of the evolution .",
    "when fragmentation driven by gravitational instabilities plays a role , accurate numerical simulations require that certain minimum resolution conditions be observed over the lifetime of the simulation .",
    "we assess the physical and numerical significance of the fragmentation behavior seen in our simulations in [ sec : fragmentation ] .",
    "other properties of our simulations may also be affected by numerical issues , with one notable case being that they provide only very coarse resolution of the circumstellar disks .",
    "an important consequence may be that numerical dissipation there is unphysically high , leading to unphysically high accretion rates onto the stars .",
    "as a component of our investigation of the accretion in section [ sec : masstrans ] , we describe simulations run with two very different particle counts , thereby resolving the circumstellar accretion disks to different extents , in order to test whether or not this numerical issue affects our results .",
    "our suite of simulations cover a parameter space within which we expect the actual  system to reside , though its exact state is currently uncertain . in order to set more stringent constraints , in section [ sec : quantitative ]",
    "we will make a number of quantitative comparisons between our simulations and the observations .",
    "in particular , we fit ellipses to the torus to determine its size and shape over time and thereby infer other properties of the system , such as the binary orbit parameters and the system s inclination .",
    "other system constraints can be derived by considering the influence that the binary orbit has on the characteristics of both the circumstellar disks and material in the gap between the circumstellar disks and the torus . in section",
    "[ sec : masstrans ] , we calculate the amount of mass transferred from the circumbinary torus onto the circumstellar disks in our simulations , to test how much this mass flux depends on the orbit parameters of the binary .",
    "we also evaluate the rates at which mass accretes from the circumstellar disks onto the stars in different system configurations .",
    "the net rate of accretion into and out of the circumstellar disks determines their lifetimes .",
    "given long enough lifetimes , planet formation may be enhanced .",
    "we discuss this possibility in section [ sec : plan - form ] .",
    "the initial conditions for the simulations performed in this work are based on the observed configuration of the  system , as discussed above , except that we have not incorporated the newly discovered binary nature of b into our models . in order to investigate various aspects of the evolution , we vary the initial conditions over the plausible parameter space outlined by both observational data and theoretical analyses , exploring uncertainties in that data .",
    "the details of the physical models and the methods used to set up the initial configurations are similar to those used in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter  and , respectively ) and we refer the reader to those works for a more complete exposition . in this section , we shall summarize the models described previously , and describe the details of the set up specific to the present study here .",
    "we use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code ` vine ' @xcite , to evolve our simulations forward in time .",
    "sph is a particle based , lagrangian method for solving the hydrodynamic equations , and so is very well suited to the complex geometry present in the multi - component systems we study .",
    "particles naturally follow the flow , concentrating resolution specifically in regions where mass itself concentrates , and removing it and the accompanying computational cost , from uninteresting regions where little material exists .",
    "this property permits the evolution of both the circumbinary torus / disk and the circumstellar disks to be modeling at the same time in the same simulation , despite their very large difference in spatial scales .",
    "it also permits detailed studies of the the mass and momentum exchange among the different components of the system , such as between the circumbinary material and the circumstellar disks .",
    "we consider a simplified model of the  system in which the ` b ' component of the system is not included .",
    "this approximation will be reasonably accurate unless the orbit of  b has a pericenter smaller than @xmath5800  au .",
    "even when such conditions exist , we expect it to affect only the outer portions of the circumbinary disk @xcite , at distances well beyond the regions of interest for our investigations .",
    "we further simplify our simulations by neglecting the recent observation of @xcite that the gg  tau  ab component is also a multiple .",
    "instead , we model the  system as two stars , each harboring a circumstellar disk , and a distribution of circumbinary material , as described by gds99 as a combined torus / disk configuration in orbit around the binary . following this description ,",
    "we configure the initial conditions for each of the three components of the system independently , then combine them together to create a synthesized , complete initial condition for each simulation .",
    "we discuss the set up of each component in turn .",
    "we model the mass distribution of the circumbinary material as a torus@xmath0disk combination .",
    "we set the dimensions of the combination such that its inner and outer edges each define a circle 180  au and 800  au in diameter , respectively .",
    "the outer boundary of the torus is set to 260  au .",
    "the center of mass of the circumbinary material is set to coincide with the system barycenter .",
    "the initial conditions of the circumbinary material are summarized graphically in figure [ fig : circumbin - ic ] .",
    "sph particles are initially laid out on a series of concentric rings centered on the origin and extending from the inner torus / disk edge at a radius of 180  au outwards to a radius of 800  au .",
    "the particle distribution follows a surface density power law : @xmath29^{-{p\\over{2}}},\\ ] ] where the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are adjusted to give the desired mass ratio between the torus and disk masses .",
    "gds99 fit a power law to the volume density in the disk with a proportionality @xmath32 .",
    "assuming a constant ratio of scale height to radius ( @xmath33 ) , this translates to a surface density power law with exponent @xmath34 .",
    "this exponent is broadly consistent with that expected for most circumstellar disk configurations and , for the sake of simplicity , we choose the exponent @xmath35 , used in our previous work for both the circumbinary disk and for the circumstellar disks , discussed below .",
    "the core radius @xmath36 for the power laws is set to @xmath36=1au , a value insignificant for the circumbinary material , but important for the circumstellar disks described below . in the suite of simulations described in this work ,",
    "we explore both torus@xmath0disk configurations and torus - only configurations . for the torus@xmath0disk models",
    ", we define the torus mass such that it contains 70% of the total , consistent with gds99 .",
    "the two factors , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are linearly decreasing functions near the torus or disk boundary , respectively .",
    "they are each defined by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 plays the role of the defined torus or disk edge , for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . with this definition",
    ", the outer torus and disk edges are smoothed in the region within a distance @xmath41 inward and outward of their nominally defined radii .",
    "we smooth both the outer edge of the disk and the torus / disk interface .",
    "this smoothing both improves consistency with the observed width of the interface , where data are available , and side - steps the unphysically large pressure gradients that would otherwise perturb the initial condition if the interface were perfectly sharp .",
    "consistent with the observed width as discussed in gds99 , we have chosen the width of the smoothed torus / disk interface to be @xmath42  au .",
    "no observational constraints are readily available for the disk s outer edge , and we choose a wider smoothing parameter of @xmath43  au for the outer edge of the disk . as a practical matter",
    ", the inner edge of the circumbinary material is unsmoothed in order to permit a more evenly distributed initial particle configuration throughout the torus . in consequence ,",
    "some small shear instabilities develop over the course of the first few hundred years of the simulations .",
    "these features are quickly overwhelmed by the larger scale evolution of the system , and so are not significant on any longer time scale .",
    "we specify the initial thermodynamic state of the disk assuming that the specific internal energy , or equivalently , temperature , in the torus and disk follows a single power law profile , given according to : @xmath44^{-{q\\over{2}}}.\\ ] ] the exponent , is set to @xmath17 , a value chosen to reproduce the fitted value obtained by gds99 and the value @xmath45 is chosen to reproduce , in combination with the equation of state , the observed temperature of @xmath46  k at a distance of 300  au from the origin .",
    "as for the surface density law , the core radius , @xmath36 , is set to @xmath36=1au , which will not significantly alter the profile for the circumbinary material , but will influence the inner edge of the circumstellar disks defined below . at the outer edge of the disk , we modify the temperature profile following the same smoothing procedure as used for the surface density , such that it falls to a minimum of 3  k at the outermost extent .",
    "matter is set up on initially circular orbits around the origin assuming rotational equilibrium .",
    "radial velocities are set to zero . for purposes of generating an initial state only",
    ", we replace the two binary components with a single point mass at the origin .",
    "it s mass , of 1.3 , is the sum of that assumed for the two stars used in the actual simulations .",
    "gravitational and pressure forces are balanced by centrifugal forces by setting @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the gravitational potential of the disk and the other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "the magnitudes of the pressure and gravitational forces are small compared to the stellar term , therefore the disk is nearly keplerian in character .",
    "the circumbinary material , at a mass of one tenth the combined stellar masses , contains sufficient mass to be marginally self - gravitating . the extent to which this is true is quantified by the well known , toomre @xmath49 parameter defined as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the local epicyclic frequency and @xmath52 is the sound speed .",
    "together , the conditions specified above combine to determine the radial profile for @xmath49 shown in figure [ fig : circumbin - ic ] . within the torus values",
    "range from @xmath53 , and we may therefore expect significant signatures of self gravitating flows . further out , in the disk , values increase to @xmath54 , and we expect this region will be largely insensitive to self gravitating disturbances",
    ". note that the @xmath49 profile shown includes small amplitude ` ringing ' oscillations , particularly in the disk , which are artifacts of the numerical derivatives ( of @xmath55 with respect to radius ) that are used to determine the epicyclic frequency .",
    "they are of little significance and may be disregarded .",
    "the two stellar components are each independently defined as point masses , and each is orbited by a circumstellar disk .",
    "the stars have masses of @xmath56 or @xmath57  for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the total system mass determined from the rotation curve of the circumbinary material ( gds99 ) and from orbital motions @xcite .",
    "it lies slightly below the ` best ' values derived from their luminosities and fits to evolutionary tracks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* where values of 0.78  and 0.68  are fit for the primary and secondary , respectively ) , but remain within the error bars imposed by those models . as discussed in section [ sec : energy - gen ] , below , we incorporate a simple model of the radiative heating on the disks , supplied by the stars .",
    "following @xcite , we specify their luminosities to be @xmath58  and @xmath59 , for primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "gravitational forces due to the stars are softened , with a softening radius of @xmath60  au and , as the systems evolve , mass may be accreted onto the star if its trajectory takes it inside this radius . the mass and momenta of accreted particles",
    "are added to that of the star .",
    "we assume that the mass of the disk around each star is @xmath61 , consistent with the observed lower limit on the mass of @xmath62  imposed by millimeter observations of the circumstellar emission ( gds99 ) .",
    "this assumption is also consistent with the masses inferred from the more recent observations of @xcite , of @xmath63 . as for the circumbinary material ,",
    "we assume the mass distribution follows a surface density power law using equation [ eq : bindenslaw ] , with an exponent of @xmath35 . for the circumstellar disks , we omit the contribution in equation [ eq : bindenslaw ] due to the torus .",
    "we set the spatial dimensions of the disks to be approximately consistent with the maximum radius dynamically permitted by the orbital parameters we assume for a given simulation .",
    "specifically , for simulations with @xmath1  au , we assume the initial outer radius of each disk to be 10  au , and for simulations with @xmath2  au , we set the outer radius to be 4  au .",
    "in each case , we smooth the outer edge , over a range @xmath64  au of the nominal edge location , following the same prescription used above for the circumbinary material",
    ".    no observations of sufficient detail exist , which may be used to determine an initial thermal state for the circumstellar disks with any precision .",
    "we are therefore free to choose conditions that provide a simple and convenient starting point , from which the disks may evolve as the various components of the system interact .",
    "therefore , as for the circumbinary disk , we set the initial specific internal energy distribution to be a power law , identical in form to equation [ eq : circumbin - temp ] . here",
    "again , we choose an exponent of @xmath17 for the power law , and a radial scale of @xmath65  au .",
    "we set the initial scale of the power law , @xmath45 , to be such that the disks are assumed to have initial minimum toomre stability = 1.5 .    in practice , and as one of us found in previous work on binary systems @xcite , we will find that the initial thermodynamic properties of the disks matters very little , since they readjust both their mass and temperature distributions within a few orbits around their primary , as the system evolves . similarly ,",
    "the mass distribution also changes in response to the evolution , though on a slower ( @xmath66  yr ) timescale .",
    "once specified as isolated systems , the two star / disk systems defined in the last section are combined to form a binary system , assuming a keplerian orbit around the system barycenter , defined to be at the origin . for systems with an initial eccentricity ,",
    "the initial positions of the stars are such that the system is at apoapse , so that the interactions between the components are at their weakest levels .",
    "we then embed this combined system into the circumbinary environment defined in section [ sec : circumbin ] , replacing the single point mass originally used to as a place - holder to configure the circumbinary system in isolation .",
    "once configured , the combined system , including the orbital elements of the binary , is free to evolve in response to gravitational forces between all of the components .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the system are very similar to those presented in , and interested readers should consult that work for a detailed description . briefly summarized , we assume that the disk matter can be approximated by an ideal gas and that radiative cooling from the disk surfaces is the only thermal energy sink .",
    "thermal energy is generated by internal sources ( shocks and viscous turbulence ) , implemented by means of an artificial viscosity term in the numerical method .",
    "in addition , for this work , we also employ a radiative heating model , with the two stars as the sources of radiant heating , as described below .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are solved assuming a vertically integrated gas pressure and a single component , ideal gas equation of state given by : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath69 is the vertically integrated pressure and @xmath70 is the specific internal energy of the gas .",
    "the value of @xmath68 assumed for these calculations is the same as that in , of @xmath71 , for the hydrodynamical evolution and @xmath72 , for the three dimensional calculation of the disk vertical structure .",
    "as in , thermal energy in the disks is permitted to escape from the system using a simple model of the disk s vertical structure to determine a ` photosphere temperature ' based on local conditions at each time step .",
    "the temperature is then used as an input into a blackbody cooling rate .",
    "the blackbody temperature is derived for each particle and at each time , using the surface density , specific internal energy and a distance as input parameters for a calculation of the temperature and density structure as a function of altitude , @xmath73 , above the midplane .",

    "the present configuration is considerably more complex than that described originally in , where the disk s vertical structure was defined assuming only the gravitational influence of a single star contributed to the vertical structure . in this work , of course ,",
    "two stars contribute , each with a different relative magnitude depending on the distance of a given location from those stars . to simplify the specification of the vertical structure ,",
    "we define three distinct regions , in which one or another limiting case holds and only one point mass can be assumed to contribute the only significant external contribution to the disk s vertical structure . for each of these limiting cases ,",
    "we create separate tabulations of the vertical structure .",
    "the regions are , respectively , locations where we may assume that the gravitational forces of either the primary or secondary alone dominate the vertical structure , and locations where the combined effect of both stars contribute to the vertical structure .",
    "we assume arbitrarily that all material at distances greater than 150  au from the system center of mass falls into the latter case . for purposes of defining the disk s vertical structure in this region ,",
    "the mass used to define the gravitational influence of the two stars is set to the sum of the masses of both stars , and its location is set artificially to the system center of mass . for material inside this 150  au limit , we determine the distance to each star and define the material as ` belonging ' to the closer of the two .",
    "given the blackbody temperature , each sph particle loses thermal energy at a rate defined by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the specific internal energy and surface density of particle @xmath84 and @xmath85 is its photosphere temperature .",
    "the surface density @xmath83 serves the dual purposes of first , relating the blackbody flux ( quantified as an energy flux ` per unit area ' ) to the specific internal energy ( quantified as an energy ` per unit mass ' ) used in our simulations and , second , of disambiguating the ` surface area ' of a single sph particle , which would otherwise suffer from confusion because of the overlap of sph particles with each other .",
    "the factor of two accounts for the two surfaces of the disk . in regions where @xmath86 we multiply the derived flux by the optical depth , @xmath75 , in order to more correctly model the cooling of optically thin regions .      thermal energy in the disk is generated from bulk mechanical energy via both reversible and irreversible processes during the course of the system s evolution .",
    "thermal energy is generated reversibly as spiral arms and similar dynamical structures become compressed and @xmath87 work is done on the gas .",
    "thermal energy is generated irreversibly in viscous processes and shocks .",
    "both of the latter processes are modeled through the use of an artificial viscosity , as is common in many implementations of hydrodynamic codes .",
    "two time and space dependent artificial viscosity terms are included . as discussed in ,",

    "the second is proportional to @xmath89 ( the ` von  neumann - richtmyer ' viscosity ) and corresponds to shock dissipation .",
    "because of the time and space dependence , an exact equivalance between the artificial viscosity and @xcite ` @xmath90 ' models does not exist .",
    "however , a correspondence can be drawn between the bulk viscous term in the code and the local value of the @xcite @xmath90 @xcite , which we can use to calibrate the magnitude of internal disspation in our simulations in comparison to the model . in 2d",
    ", the correspondence can be expressed for particle @xmath91 as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the coefficient to reduce numerical shear viscosity for sph simulations defined by @xcite , @xmath94 is the artificial bulk viscosity coefficient , @xmath95 is the orbit frequency , @xmath96 the sound speed and @xmath97 the smoothing length of particle @xmath91 . averaged over many particles in some suitable radial range , equation [ eq : balsara ] provides a useful estimate of the magnitude of the artificial viscosity .    the calculations of  showed that the artificial viscosity produced a dissipation comparable in magnitude to an @xmath90 equal to a few @xmath98 , but that the dissipation was resolution dependent so that the physical dissipation of the real system was probably lower than this value .",
    "the circumbinary torus / disk configuration used in this work is both different than the circumstellar disks in and is resolved with far more particles , so we do not expect dissipation at comparable levels to that work .",
    "indeed , using the relationship quoted in @xcite , we find energy dissipation rates in typical regions of the torus to be an order of magnitude or more smaller , comparable to models with @xmath99 or less . in the case of the circumstellar disks , which are configured similarly to @xcite",
    ", we estimate the energy generation rates to correspond to those in @xmath90 models where @xmath100 .",
    "it is important to note in these estimates that while the magnitude of the dissipation in our simulations does correspond to that in a @xcite model with a given parameter , the physics as realized in the simulation does not corresponds directly to the physics underlying such models .",
    "specifically , the turbulent eddies out of which the dissipation is assumed to arise are absent in our simulations , because we model only two dimensions .",
    "rather , the presence of such dissipation is effectively an assumption that such turbulent eddies are present and are the only source of internal energy generation in the fluid .",
    "as discussed in , this includes the assumption that the flow is reasonably smooth , and that strong shocks are not present .",
    "we shall find this assumption is violated in the work presented here , as it was in our earlier work on binary systems @xcite .",
    "strong interactions between the binary components produce large amplitude spiral structures in the circumstellar disks , including strong shocks that inevitably accompany such structures .",
    "the circumbinary material also produces large amplitude spiral structures and shocks generated by the stirring motion of the binary itself . in both cases , additional heating of the disk matter occurs . in comparison to the bulk viscosity , these heating events generate internal energy at several times the smooth ` background ' rate in the torus , though only in a much smaller fraction of the total volume , where the spiral structures themselves are present .    in early simulations ,",
    "performed only with internal heating sources , we found that temperatures in the circumbinary torus and disk fell to values well below those observed for the  system and , in the outer regions of the disk , even to the lower limit of 3  k we have implemented in the code itself .",
    "the rate of thermal energy generation due to internal processes is less than is required to balance the radiative cooling in the circumbinary material .",
    "we conclude that a correct model of the system requires that additional , external heating sources be included in the inventory of physical processes describing the system .",
    "although insufficient by themselves to heat the disk and balance radiative cooling losses , we will show below ( e.g. section [ sec : heatoff ] ) that heating from dynamical processes does still provide a significant source of energy input to the system .",
    "therefore a passive radiative heating model , such as described by @xcite , will also not be an appropriate ingredient to an accurate physical model of the system .",
    "we have therefore developed a simple model for the radiative heating of the disks by the stars , using a prescription which is similar in spirit to the radiative cooling model described above .",
    "specifically , we assume that each star radiates isotropically at a constant luminosity , and that all of the stellar radiation impinging on the two disk surfaces ( i.e. both above and below the disk midplane ) is absorbed .",
    "we estimate that energy absorption rate as follows . by definition ,",
    "a star s luminosity is the energy flux that it emits per unit time , with its value per unit area of any spherical volume centered on that star being @xmath101 .",
    "this flux falls on the two surfaces of the disk , each oriented at an angle to the radially outward directed stellar flux .",
    "the flux absorbed per unit area by the disk s surface will be diluted from the stellar flux due to the mismatch between the normal directions of the stellar flux and the disk surface . in order to quantify the energy absorbed correctly , we must determine the size relationship between a surface element oriented radially and one oriented normal to the disk surface .",
    "following gds99 , we assume that stellar flux impinges on the disk horizontally and that the disk surface s normal vector is tilted at an angle @xmath68 , as measured downwards from a vector pointed towards the disk s north or south ` pole ' .",
    "then , simple geometric arguments provide the relationship we require : the flux per unit area of disk surface will be diluted from the flux per unit area of stellar flux by the dot product of the unit vectors defining their respective orientations . that dot product reduces to the cosine of the angle between them and ,",
    "if we assume that the disk is not significantly flared , it s value will be defined at every location by it s radial distance from the star and the altitude of surface at which the disk material becomes optically thick to stellar radiation : @xmath102 then , the rate of energy absorption of the stellar flux at any given location of the disk s surface will be given by the relation @xmath103 the factor of two accounts for the fact that both the upper and lower disk surfaces will be heated by the stellar flux .",
    "the surface density term plays the same role in this equation that it does in equation [ eq : dudt - radcool ] above .",
    "namely , to recast the energy flux per unit area in terms of the specific internal energy ( i.e. as a change to the energy per unit mass ) , which is the conserved quantity employed in vine .",
    "the remaining unknown in equation [ eq : dudt - radheat ] is the value of @xmath104 , through its presence in the cosine term in equation [ eq : cosgamma ] . in general , the value of @xmath104 will be different than the altitude of the disk s photosphere however , because the latter characterizes an optical thickness to its own internal radiation , rather than to stellar photons .",
    "we therefore utilize a measure of the disk s scale height , derived from the same vertical structure calculation used to determine the cooling rates described in in section [ sec : energy - diss ] .    as for the cooling calculations , and to simplify the model , we employ the same three limiting regions as were used in the radiative cooling model . at distances",
    "more than 150  au from the system center of mass , we the calculate vertical structure assuming a single star at the origin whose mass is the sum of the two binary components . at closer distances ,",
    "the scale height is determined assuming that each sph particle belongs to the nearer of the two stars in the binary .",
    "the radiative heating and cooling models used in this work are deliberately simplified from the actual radiative transfer processes present in the real systems . here",
    "we explore the implications that these simplifications make on our simulations , in order to provide insights into the conclusions we may draw from them .    as noted above",
    ", we multiply the derived flux by the optical depth , @xmath75 , in regions where @xmath86 , in order to more correctly model the cooling of optically thin regions . the circumstellar disks and the torus region of the circumbinary material",
    "are optically thick to their own radiation throughout the calculation , so that in practice , this modification has little effect . in the circumbinary disk region however , the optical depth falls to near unity , making the disk only marginally optically thick and endangering the assumptions made in deriving the cooling rates there .",
    "because the focus of our work is mainly on the interactions between the stars , their circumstellar material , and the torus , errors in the cooling rates at large distances , and their consequences for the dynamical behavior , will be comparatively small .    for other regions , such as the gap between the circumstellar and circumbinary material ,",
    "material densities become even more tenuous , with correspondingly smaller optical depths as well . in these regions ,",
    "the coupling of the material to the radiation becomes increasingly tenous as well , and the radiative heating and cooling treatments used in our work fail to provide accurate treatments of the energy flow . since we expect that the radiative energy fluxes into and out of the material will be substantially diminished by the reduced coupling efficiency , we simply disable both the radiative heating and cooling entirely when such conditions are found in our simulations .",
    "specifically , when the surface density of any given sph particle falls to a value less than .05  gm/@xmath105 , we assume that no radiative heating or cooling occurs for that particle .    as for radiative cooling ,",
    "the accuracy of the radiative heating suffers in the outer regions of the circumbinary disk .",
    "because our model assumes that thermal energy is deposited in an entire vertical column of material , rather than only in a surface layer , we overestimate the actual amount of heating there , since in fact most of the column is shielded by material closer to the stars . because we are interested primarily in the dynamical behavior of the torus and circumstellar disks where the effect is smaller , the over estimates at larger radii will be of limited concern for interpreting our results .",
    "the dimensions of the  system are typical of a number of similar systems , as noted in section [ sec : ggtau ] , so that our models serve as prototypes for the behavior of that class . of course",
    ", the exact dimensions of each system vary and , with them , so do the time scales important for their evolution . in order to provide a calibration for our readers , we define here several relevant time and distance scales for the initial conditions used in our simulations .    together with the masses of the binary components , the semi - major axis assumed for the binary orbit",
    "defines its orbital period .",
    "the initial conditions defined for our simulations include setups with semi - major axes of @xmath2  au and @xmath1  au , which correspond to orbital periods of 158  yr and 426  yr , respectively .",
    "the orbital period of material in the torus provides another interesting timescale .",
    "given its initial inner boundary at 180  au and the initial condition specification above , we can estimate its orbit period to be @xmath106  yr .",
    "these orbit radii , together with the inner torus edge , define dimensionless ratios of @xmath107 for the 32  au semi - major axis , and @xmath108 for the 62  au semi - major axis , where @xmath109 is the torus inner radius .",
    "we defined the initial configuration of the circumstellar disks to have outer radii that are each a large fraction of the orbital separation between the components making up the binary , consistent with our expectation that such a configuration will be nearer to the ` asymptotic ' long term configuration .",
    "as the simulations proceed , they will grow or shrink according to the amount of accretion into the circumstellar environment from the torus and the amount of accretion out of the disks onto the star around which they orbit . in this context ,",
    "another relevant dimension for the system is the limiting distance for stable orbits around the star to exist .",
    "@xcite have calculated such criteria for a variety of system configurations and , for the systems studied here , derive outermost stable radii of @xmath110 and @xmath111  au for the a@xmath11262  au systems with eccentricity of @xmath4 or @xmath3 , respectively , and @xmath113  au and @xmath114  au for the a@xmath11232  au systems with @xmath4 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these radii are slightly larger than the initial sizes of the disks in our study",
    ". the difference does not imply any inconsistency in the model because we anticipate ( and as we shall observe below , correctly so ) that the disks will quickly reconfigure themselves according to the dynamical evolution of the system , and because the present calculations include hydrodynamical effects not addressed in @xcite .",

    "we attach little physical significance to these early time features and instead attribute them merely to the growth and relaxation of ` start up transients ' related to our idealized initial condition for the actual complex system .",
    "after the first several orbits of the binary , such small scale instabilities have been largely overwhelmed by the growth of features driven by the strong stirring action of the stars on the circumbinary material .",

    "later , after 6 - 8 binary orbits and as the results of interactions between the torus and binary begin to accumulate , the density inhomogeneities become more and more widespread . at this time , the lumps have largely dissipated , and the ring itself has broken up into several filamentary spiral arms , each of which contain still finer scale substructure .    over time , the original sharp inner edge of the torus becomes progressively more ragged and diffuse as the binary interactions perturb it .",
    "as it evolves , it both moves inwards towards the stars and its shape changes , becoming significantly non - circular and producing spiral streams that extend inwards towards the binary .",
    "as pictured , the inner edge of the torus appears similar to an ellipse whose semi - major axis is approximately perpendicular to the axis joining the two stars .",
    "because each of the images in the mosaic is generated at the same orbital phase , the relative phase of the binary orbit and the elliptical torus edge appears nearly constant .",

    "an important result of the sections above was to show that the stirring action of the binary on the surrounding material is very strong , with large scale spiral structures being continually generated .",
    "such stirring serves as a foundation for the model described in ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the gap region in the close binaries is visibly smaller in size than in the wide , and more in the @xmath3 cases than in the eccentric orbit cases . in every case , and similarly to the torus / disk models above , well defined spiral structures form in the tori and , in several examples , they fragment into clumps . in all cases , the spiral structures are driven by the stirring action of the stars and propagate outwards , carrying material as they do so .",
    "also as in the torus / disk models , the edges of the spiral arms are sharply defined , particularly in the two wide binary examples where the stars interact more strongly with the torus .",

    "guided by the results we will describe in section [ sec : quantitative ] below , we set a value of 350  au for this radius , which we choose as a compromise between capturing the true mass of the disk component over time , and masking out transient changes to it that are due to portions of the torus flexing such that parts of it extend beyond our critical radius .    in every case , the mass increases over time , showing that the process itself is robust across a wide variety of configurations .",
    "the magnitude and overall pattern of the mass transport varies however , both from simulation to simulation and from time to time within the same simulation .",
    "after @xmath125 torus orbits , corresponding to 6500  yr run time of the simulations , the total mass transport corresponds to about 5% of the total initial mass of the circumbinary material in the torus@xmath0disk systems , and is @xmath126 times higher , at @xmath127% , in the torus only systems . in the torus@xmath0disk runs , the outer disk mass increases at a near constant rate , with small oscillations visible , superimposed on the long term trend .",
    "in contrast , in the torus only runs , the mass transport is almost entirely limited to the first @xmath128  yr of the evolution , with the outer disk mass becoming essentially constant thereafter or even decreasing slightly . only in the last @xmath129",
    "yr of the runs , does the outer disk mass begin to increase again .",
    "the duration of our simulations are long in the context of the circumstellar environments and the number of binary orbit periods we simulate .",
    "unfortunately , they are short in comparison to the orbital timescales of circumbinary material , where a time of 6500  yr corresponds to only @xmath126 orbits . therefore , due to the high cost of running the simulations , we have not followed the evolution for the long times required to determine whether or not the outer disk masses return to their high rate of growth , or if the decrease is simply a signature of the overall flexing action of the circumbinary structures as they respond to the binary s stirring action .",
    "we are therefore unable to conclude that the outward material migration will continue at the same rate or decrease , or even if time variations within a given simulation continue indefinitely .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the outer disk mass increases in all of our models , is strong evidence that the excretion process will continue in the initially torus - only systems , such that they evolve to become robust torus@xmath0disk systems .    given the rate of outward material movement , and the fact that the disk in the  system is observed ( gds99 ) to contain a mass of @xmath130 , the entire disk could be generated from such transport activity within a few @xmath131  yr .",
    "we therefore conclude that the disk material surrounding the  torus most likely originates as torus material which was thrown outwards by the stirring action of the binary .",
    "gravitational torques between the stars and circumbinary material play an important role in their mutual evolution . here",
    ", we turn to a study of these torques , in order to understand their importance in forming multiple star systems like .",
    "torques between the stars and the torus will affect both and , if large enough , cause measurable changes even over the comparatively short duration of our simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : sumtorq ] shows the net torque exerted by the stars on the circumbinary material",
    ". in all cases , the torque magnitudes vary both in amplitude and sign on time scales comparable to the orbit periods of the binaries . also ,",
    "while oscillations are correlated with the binary orbit , consecutive peaks and troughs are neither evenly spaced in time nor are their amplitudes the same .",
    "the amplitude of the variations are larger in the torus - only systems than in the torus@xmath0disk systems , consistent with the increased mass concentration in the former case . with few exceptions ,",
    "the magnitude of the peaks in the wide orbit examples exceed the magnitude of adjacent troughs , such that the average over many orbits is positive .",
    "as seen , e.g. , in section [ sec : wide - morph ] above , the torques from the binary drive strong spiral waves into the torus in wide configurations , but are much less effective in the close configurations shown later .",
    "their absence leads to the question of what process remains to drive the excretion flow discussed above ?",
    "we note that , while stellar torques are weak in such systems , torques due to self gravity remain , and we conclude that they are important contributors to the excretion flow .    with a change in sign",
    ", the total torque on the circumbinary material is the same as that on the binary . to",
    "what extent do torques of these magnitudes alter its orbit over time ?",
    "@xcite makes estimates using a diffusion approximation based analysis where the torques are mediated by viscosity . here ,",
    "no such model is required , since we have a direct quantification of the torques from the simulations themselves .",
    "we therefore estimate the time scales using time averaged torques determined directly from the curves shown in figure [ fig : sumtorq ] . while the torques in the wide orbit runs exhibit positive maxima of @xmath132  dyn  cm and negative minima of @xmath133  dyn  cm , their averages over time take on values near @xmath134  dyn  cm .",
    "the circumbinary material thus gains angular momentum at the expense of the binary , consistent with the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the close orbit torques are each more than an order of magnitude smaller and are also more nearly symmetric over their positive and negative extrema , with time averages consistent with zero net torque .    neglecting factors near unity ,",
    "the net angular momentum of the stars around the system barycenter is given by @xcite as @xmath135 , with @xmath136 being the combined mass of the two stars .",
    "the time scale for changes in the semi - major axis is @xmath137 . in terms of the parameters of the wide and close orbit systems",
    ", the angular momentum translates to numerical values of @xmath138 or @xmath139  gm  @xmath105/s , respectively .",
    "thus , combined with the time averaged torques derived from figure [ fig : sumtorq ] , the timescale for significant changes to the semi - major axis becomes @xmath140  myr for the wide systems and @xmath141  myr for the close systems .",
    "the long time scales in the close orbit models , in pringle s interpretation , correspond to a system in an initial phase where the torus has yet to ` find out ' about the presence of the binary .",
    "in contrast , the shorter time scales in the wide orbit simulations correspond to the period in which the torus is gradually expelled by the torques applied by the binary .",
    "they are also comparable to the pre main sequence lifetimes of stellar systems @xcite , indicating that the final  system configuration has yet to be established .",
    "before we may conclude that the action of the orbiting stars on the circumbinary material is significant for the overall evolution of the system , we must compare the results of our simulations to systems with analogous configurations where the binary is not present .",
    "similarly , in order to conclude that the radiative heating from the stars is important , we must compare to simulations in which that heating is omitted . to those ends , we have configured and run a simulation in which the radiative heating term has been neglected , and another in which we have replaced the two components of the binary with a single star of the same mass , located at the origin . in order to provide a similar level of heating to the system , this star radiates with a luminosity equal to the sum of the luminosities of the binary components .",

    "the image shows that in each case , approximately 38 - 39 separate clumps have formed from the initially smooth tori during this comparatively short timescale .",
    "although not shown in the images themselves , these clumps initially appeared after only @xmath13  yr of evolution and continued to develop further as the simulations proceeded .",
    "we monitored the status of the simulations for adherence to the numerical resolution requirements discussed in @xcite and found that these clumps are indeed sufficiently resolved according to the criteria described there .",
    "evidence for self gravitating instabilities is present in the torus region of all of our other simulations , including several which exhibit one or more clearly developed fragments .",
    "however , even the simulations in which fragmentation was observed do not produce fragments so quickly or in such large numbers . in this regard ,",
    "the configurations that develop here are unique in our suite of simulations , and follow a clearly different evolutionary path than any of the simulations that include both the binary components and radiative heating . since such ubiquitous fragmentation requires cold torus material , and the action of the stellar irradiation and the tidal interactions of the binary will be to increase the internal energy of the material , we conclude that both the stellar irradiation and the stirring action of the binary are critical contributors to the overall thermodynamic state of the circumbinary environment of .      in the sections above ,",
    "we have discussed the overall morphology of the circumbinary material as it evolves using qualitative metrics of its behavior .",
    "we now turn to more quantitative metrics to describe the evolution . in particular ,",
    "we have noted above that the torus appears to flex both radially and azimuthally over time , with various components moving both inwards and outwards as spiral waves pass through them .",
    "here , we quantify the changes in the shape of the torus , by fitting its shape to a set of three ellipses , chosen as approximations of its inner and outer edges and its midpoint . in the following sections , we show example fits at two snapshots in time in order to illustrate the fidelity of the fits to the underlying data , and then as functions of time , in order to show their variations as the system evolves .    for each ellipse , we fit for three important quantities : its semi - major axis , its eccentricity and its orientation . we discuss the fits for the two simulations _",
    "wide3ehi _ and _ clos0ehi_. we choose the first because both the binary s wide orbit ( semi - major axis ) and its eccentricity carry it closer to the torus than any other .",
    "we choose the second for exactly the opposite reason : its tighter orbit and zero eccentricity mean that it stays most distant from the torus over the course of its orbit .",
    "we expect that these system configurations will therefore bracket the parameters for which the effect of the binary on the torus is the largest and smallest of all the configurations in our study .",
    "sph particles do not easily lend themselves to standard procedures for generating fits to the ellipses we use to model the system shape . therefore , in order to generate fits , we first map the surface density of the disk material onto an 1800@xmath1431800 cartesian grid , on which the fitting can be accomplished straightforwardly .",
    "the grid has spatial dimensions of 900@xmath143900  au and is centered on the origin , such that each grid cell is 0.5  au in linear extent .",
    "the mapping implements the same interpolation procedure as is used in the sph algorithm to determine the surface densities for each particle in the simulation itself .",
    "unfortunately in the present context however , the resolution afforded by our simulations and the mapping retains very small scale features in the flow , including accretion streams and other spiral structures only peripherally associated with the torus .",
    "this level of detail frequently causes the fitting procedure outlined below to produce poorer fits of the large scale torus morphology in favor of matching these peripheral structures . in order to more accurately capture only the large scale features of the torus , we therefore convolve the density mapping with a gaussian psf with a characteristic length scale ( i.e. , its half - width , half maximum ) of 10  au .    with this modification of the density mapping ,",
    "we compute an azimuth averaged surface density and extract a maximum over all radii .",
    "this maximum is used , in turn , as a critical value to extract the set of all grid points lying on three distinct isodensity contours .",
    "we define one such contour by the condition that the local surface density matches the maximum azimuth averaged value , and two others by the condition that the local density is 20% of that maximum value , and falls either radially inside of , or outside of , a circle centered on the origin and 220  au in radius .",
    "these contours correspond roughly to the torus inner and outer boundaries and to its high density core .",
    "finally , given the points defining the three contours , we use the numerical recipes routine ` mrqmin ' @xcite to extract the semi - major axis , the eccentricity and the axis of pericenter for the best fit ellipses to each isosurface .",
    "in addition to the three fit parameters , we also permit the origin of each ellipse to be offset from the system barycenter in the @xmath144 and @xmath145 coordinates , taking the final ellipse parameters from the offset for which the @xmath146 value for the fit is minimized .    in order to avoid contamination of our fits by circumstellar material , we mask out a circular region of the grid , centered on the origin . its radius is defined to be slightly larger than the largest extent to which the circumstellar material extends at any time during its orbit , which will occur when the binary is at apoapse and also includes the combined radii of the two circumstellar disks . specifically , we define radius of the circumstellar mask region as : @xmath147 with the identification of the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the binary using their usual identifiers , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , the first term defines half the apoapse separation of the binary components . in the second term , the quantities @xmath150 and @xmath151 are each defined using the expression derived in @xcite , to approximate the largest radius for which an orbit around the star is stable over a suitably long duration .",
    "we multiply the combined radii by a scale factor , @xmath152 , to account for the fact that material may be present intermittently at larger distances from each star for shorter durations than are accomodated by the @xcite formalism .",
    "figure [ fig : torus - fits ] shows isodensity contours and fits for simulation _",
    "wide3ehi _ , at each of the three locations defined above , both as raw contours and as convolved with a 10  au psf .",
    "the times at which the fits were obtained correspond to the same apoapse and periapse passages shown in figure [ fig : wide - ecc-1orb ] , below . in each panel ,",
    "the fitted ellipses are shown along with the contours but are frequently obscured by the data , visually demonstrating the fit quality .",
    "although the differences between the raw and the convolved contours are not large , they are nevertheless significant . for example , in the case of the maximum isodensity contours ( center panels ) , the accretion streams are eliminated in the convolution .",
    "little change occurs in the fitted ellipses in these cases , but both the inner and outer contours exhibit much larger differences , particularly so in the case of the orientation .",
    "for example , the difference is @xmath153 degrees in each of the two snapshots of the outer contour , a value comparable to the precession angle over the timespan of the two fit times .",
    "the largest differences are seen in the fits for inner contour at apoapse ( upper left panel ) , where the difference is nearly 90 degrees .",
    "the inner contours are also those for which both the difference between the two times is most significant and the fidelity of the fit to the underlying data is least accurate . while the apoapse snapshot ( top ) requires significant eccentricity for a good fit to both the raw and convolved data , the periapse snapshot ( bottom ) is best fit to a much more circular shape . in this case , although the contour is indeed intrinsically more circular , the fit remains compromised by the incompletely obscured presence of the accretion streams in the contours which contribute non - negligibly to the fit .",
    "we conclude that while our fits to the middle and outer contours are minimally affected by such features , fits to the inner contour will be of lesser quality due to such contributions .",
    "figure [ fig : torus - radii ] shows fits for each of the three semi - major axes defined above , as functions of time , along with the offset of each ellipse from the actual system barycenter . in each case the semi - major axis varies over time , with the inner ellipse featuring the most rapid changes and the outer ellipse the slowest .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations extend some @xmath8  au in either direction from its long term averaged value .",
    "the inner and outer ellipses also exhibit slow secular trends to smaller and larger extents , respectively , as the torus itself becomes distorted by the passage of spiral structures through it .",
    "although the trends are visible over the entire duration of the simulation , it is unlikely that they will continue over much longer time spans . for the inner ellipse ,",
    "the trend will be constrained by the fact that the action of the binary will tidally truncate the torus edge .",
    "the outer edge trend will be limited by the fact that the spiral structures decrease in amplitude as they move outwards , merging with the smooth background disk .    in each case",
    ", the offset of the best fit ellipse s origins from the system barycenter fluctuates most rapidly of all , but with comparatively small amplitudes of @xmath154  au , and often with evident correlations between the set of offsets for the three ellipses at a given time . at late times in the simulation ( @xmath155  yr ) , the offsets each increase to between 10 and 20  au , in response to the larger inhomogeneities in the tori from which they are derived , as seen in section [ sec : evo - circumbin ] .",
    "even these late time offsets remain substantially smaller than the @xmath156  au offsets derived from the  system by gds99 and @xcite however . in part",
    ", we attribute this difference to the fact that the fits to the observations assume a circular torus , while our ellipse fits include additional degrees of freedom , which permit the ellipse origin to relax toward the system s barycenter , while retaining a good fit to the shape .",
    "more importantly however , the discrepancy serves to highlight an important difference between the characteristics of the observations and our simulations .",
    "namely , that the fitted parameters for our simulations do not trace exactly the same physical features as fits of various torus parameters derived from observed systems do . here , they account only for density features in our 2d representation of the flow , while in observed systems such as , the various system characteristics include features that trace both the system s 3d geometry , such as the disk scale height , and its radiated output , both from scattered and internal sources .",
    "such characteristics may be correlated with the density , but do not trace it directly .",

    "the difference is consistent with the fact that the torus is more strongly perturbed in the wide binary configuration .",
    "for all three fits , the eccentricities also rise to values typical of their longer term evolution within only 1 - 2 orbits of the binary , but continue to vary widely over the full duration of the simulation .",
    "this rise time is far shorter than a single orbit of the torus material defining the edge itself , and demonstrates the importance of the stars on the torus morphology .",
    "consistent with its proximity to the perturbing effects of the stars , the torus inner edge suffers the largest variations from its initial circular form . in the case of the wide orbit configuration ,",
    "the eccentricity undergoes repeated excursions to values greater than @xmath159 and less than @xmath160 , corresponding to a nearly circular shape .",
    "also , the variations appear to be nearly periodic , perhaps arising as consequences of the binary s influence on the inner torus . to the extent that they are quantifiable however , the ocscillations do not correspond to the binary orbit period through any simple relationship , arguing against any direct connection .",
    "similar variability is present in the fits derived from central torus region , but the maxima do not extend to values as large as at the inner edge .",
    "also , in both simulations , the eccentricities of the central ellipses remain near zero for long time spans , alternating with periods in which their values are much higher .",
    "in contrast , both the inner and outer ellipses typically retain their large eccentricities during these periods .",
    "direct examination of the simulation morphology reveals that the systems have developed several , more or less equally spaced , spiral structures at these times . in consequence , though the non - axisymmetric character of the torus remains , the best fit ellipse derived from it becomes more circular , as the various features driving the fit to higher eccentricity cancel each other out .",

    ", we might expect the torus to remain aligned along that same axis , since the binary s orbital motion implies a strong forcing function to facilitate such alignment .",
    "this expectation is clearly not met in our simulations . instead , the tori around both the eccentric and circular orbit binary appear to precess over time , as indicated by their continuing increases in angle and their periodic returns to zero as the motion sweeps around the compass .    the tori precess at different rates depending on distance from the system barycenter , with both simulations producing similar rates for the fits at the middle and outer edge of the torus , as measured by the similar slopes of the curves and the time required to return to a given orientation .",
    "in contrast , the precession behaviors for the inner ellipses in the two simulations are not similar to each other .",
    "instead , the precession in the eccentric binary run corresponds approximately to a periodicity of twice the binary orbit period ( i.e. @xmath161  yr ) , over the course of many binary orbits , while for the circular binary run , it is much longer .",
    "we speculate that the precession in the first case is being driven by the forcing action of the binary . in the circular binary case , and for the center and outer tori ,",
    "the influence of the stars on the tori is much weaker . in these regions ,",
    "the precession periods correspond loosely to the orbital periods of the tori at each location , with the exception discussed below for the center torus .",
    "although the correspondence itself is apparent , we do not believe a direct , causal connection between the precession rates and the orbital motion of the torus material can be established however because , in general , the precession is clearly only approximately periodic .",
    "the axis of pericenter angle neither changes at a uniform rate , nor does it increase monotonically with time . instead , occasional reversals occur , as the fit adapts to details of the local flow , and sudden discontinuities in the angle are also common , as the fit adjusts to the growth or decay of some structure in the torus .",
    "such events are visible at @xmath162  yr in fit for the outer torus edge in the _ clos0ehi _ simulation , for example , and much more frequently in the center and inner torus fits .",
    "jumps are particularly common in the central torus , and occur at the same times for which we noted above that the fitted eccentricity hovers near zero . given this correspondence , we attribute the jumps there to the same cause : i.e. that the torus has evolved into a set of spiral structures of near equal spacing and appearance , causing the fitted axis of pericenter to become highly sensitive to small scale features of the torus as a result .    of some interest",
    "is that the phase of the precession in one simulation is frequently similar to that in the other  the pericenter angles are nearly the same at the same times for the outer and middle tori .",
    "we believe that the similarity is not driven by any physical condition common to the two configurations , but is rather a consequence of the identical initial condition specified for the torus , which has not yet been erased by its subsequent evolution .",
    "the inner torus edge follows the same pattern as well , both for the correlation in angle and in periodicity , but the correlation remains close for less than a single orbit period there , before being lost .",
    "observations of  have conclusively demonstrated that a significant quantity of material is present in very close proximity to the stars themselves .",
    "recent observations have even detected material in locations where its dynamical lifetime can not be exceed a few hundred years @xcite before being accreted into the circumstellar disks or otherwise cleared from the system . in this work , we have assumed that all circumstellar material is initially contained in circumstellar disks orbiting each star , and in this section , we discuss the evolution of that material as it evolves .",
    "we will investigate the processes by which material is transfered into the circumstellar environment from the circumbinary environment , and what configurations the cirumstellar disks evolve towards over time as material moves through them into and out of them .",
    "the morphology of a system with a wide , eccentric orbit ( simulation _ wide3ehi _ ) is shown in figure [ fig : wide - ecc-1orb ] for various phases of its evolution through one binary orbit period .",
    "details of the orbital evolution vary between orbits , and we have chosen to show the eighth orbit after the simulation s beginning ( i.e. beginning at @xmath163  yr ) because it exhibits the largest magnitude episode of mass accretion of any single orbit during the simulation ( see section [ sec : acc - onto - disks ] below ) . it therefore provides the most easily visible illustrations of similar events that occur at other times , but which are of smaller magnitude . in addition , rather than",
    "show frames equi - distant from each other in time , we have chosen frames selected to highlight various aspects of the flow as the binary travels through a complete orbit , referencing the time since last apoapse for various time intervals in the orbit in the text .    in the first frame of the mosaic , where the components are at apoapse , the disks show little evidence of internal structure such as spiral density waves .",
    "consistent with its higher mass ( see section [ sec : acc - onto - disks ] below ) , the mass densities in the secondary disk ( to the left in the image ) , are higher than in the primary .",
    "the shape of the cavity between the stellar components and the circumbinary material is significantly non-`round ' and includes fragmentary spiral structures that are remnants of previous interactions between the components .",
    "these fragments are traveling outwards towards the circumbinary torus , which they will soon rejoin .",
    "as the binary components begin another orbit , falling towards each other , large streams of material are pulled away from the torus and follow the stars on similar inward trajectories . due to its orbital motion , the inbound material forms large scale spiral structures",
    "as it travels through the gap region and does not directly impact either circumstellar disk . by the time the stars have reached their 1/4 phase ( frames 2 - 4 , some 80 - 140  yr after apoapse ) ,",
    "the leading edges of the spiral structures have overtaken the stellar components and wrapped around them , with the close tidal interactions causing them to begin to spread out again as they move away from the star .",
    "a portion of this material may impact the other component of the binary , while the remainder forms a temporary ` bar ' extending between the two binary components .",
    "material arriving slightly later ( frames 4 - 7 , 140 - 220  yr after apoapse ) , does directly impact portions of the outer circumstellar disks and the flow pattern becomes quite complex .",
    "the time interval shortly before and during periapse is , unsurprisingly , the interval over which the most complex interactions take place . the various interactions between the infalling streams , the ` bar ' and disks cause substantial disruption in each . as a consequence , the spatial extent of the circumstellar material increases , with mass from all three sources contributing to the extended disks for each star .",
    "the amount and distribution of material in the accretion streams is near its maximum at this time as well .",
    "it is noteworthy however , that only a small fraction of the material in the streams actually accretes into the circumstellar environment , with the remainder returning to the torus .",
    "illustrating this fact , figure [ fig : velocity ] shows the velocity magnitude at the same periapse passage shown in the sixth panel of the mosaic in figure [ fig : wide - ecc-1orb ] , along with velocity vectors on a small set of representative particles as well .",
    "the latter show the motion of the streams extending well around and away from both the stars and the surrounding circumstellar material .",
    "near the circumstellar disks , velocity magnitudes in the streams increase to as much as 5 - 8  km / s , comparable to the keplerian motion of the material within the circumstellar disks themselves , and well in excess of the 2 - 3  km / s orbital velocities of the components themselves .",
    "the high velocities generated as the streams move through the gap are also important for conditions well within the circumstellar environment itself .",
    "figure [ fig : disk - temps ] shows the midplane temperatures of the material , again at periapse . while the accretion streams themselves contain the coldest of all material in the circumstellar environment , at temperatures below @xmath550  k , temperatures in small regions near the impact points of the streams increase to 3 - 500  k as the kinetic energy of the infall is converted to heat .",
    "these temperatures are well in excess of the @xmath164  k temperatures found in immediately adjacent regions of the disks , not affected by the streams impact . these @xmath164  k temperatures at the outer disk edges are the lowest found within the disks . at other locations ,",
    "temperatures increase to as high as 1000  k ( extending to values beyond the color bar range shown in the figure ) within 1  au of each star .",

    "the disk structures generated by the interactions near periapse decay to near axisymmetry over the next 1 - 200  yr , as the stars recede from each other and again approach apoapse ( frames 8 - 12 , 250 - 420  yr after apoapse ) .    during these later phases of the orbit , and at larger distances from the stars , material in the tidal streams which was able to pass by both circumstellar regions without impacting either , continues on trajectories which returns it to the circumbinary torus from which it came .",
    "as they travel through the gap , the spiral structures into which material is organized begin to lose the sharp definition that characterizes their appearance in the earlier phases of the binary orbit .",
    "such loss of coherence is most noticable in the innermost portions of the streams , for which tidal interactions with the binary were largest .",
    "nevertheless , such structures remain coherent well after their return to the main volume of the torus and , as discussed in section [ sec : evo - circumbin ] above , their existence in and influence on the torus are of major importance for the overall density and temperature structure well beyond its inner edge .",
    "a markedly different pattern of behavior occurs in the case of a @xmath2  au orbit for the binary .",
    "figure [ fig : clos - ecc-1orb ] shows the evolution of the _ clos3ehi _ simulation over the course of one binary orbit . in comparison to the wide orbit case , a much larger fraction of torus material has moved inwards into what was originally the outer gap region . despite this , and in contrast to the behavior seen with the wide orbit model , the remaining gap region continues to be clear of material over the entire binary orbit .",
    "accretion streams do develop , but are quite weak and remain distinct for only a fraction of the distance inward to the stars .",
    "no bar develops between the stars at periapse because the weaker accretion streams are unable to feed the circumstellar region with enough material to produce one .",
    "also , due to the closer orbital separation , the circumstellar disks are spatially more compact than in the wide orbit case and assymetries that develop within them are also correspondingly less distinct .    with small variations ,",
    "the same behaviors appear during each binary orbit in both the wide and close cases .",
    "we have not shown the @xmath3 models corresponding to the eccentric orbit models described here , however we note that their behaviors largely mimic those of their eccentric cousins .",
    "an important exception to this trend is the fact that only the wide , eccentric model in figure [ fig : wide - ecc-1orb ] shows the strong accretion streams and episodic accretion .",
    "we have seen that as the system evolves through time , the action of the binary generates large amplitude density structures throughout the circumbinary torus , extending outwards into the low density disk that surrounds it .",
    "likewise , similar structures propagate inwards from the torus and , at various orbital phases , contact the circumstellar disks .",
    "some of the mass in these streams becomes a permanent part of the circumstellar environment , while the remainder propagates outwards to rejoin the torus again .",
    "in addition to mass accretion from the circumbinary environment , mass contained in the circumstellar disks is subject to the action of the same strong gravitational torques that perturb the circumbinary material .",
    "it may therefore migrate radially inward towards the star and , when it gets close enough , be accreted by the star .    in this section",
    ", we quantify the rates and timing of the accretion into and out of the cirumstellar environment , and the masses of the disks that result . as one aspect of our discussion",
    ", we will describe simulations of the same physical configuration at two different resolutions , differing by a factor of four in particle count . through the relationship in eq .",
    "[ eq : balsara ] , this difference will be sufficient to change the numerical viscosity by a factor of @xmath165 .",
    "a difference of this magnitude will in turn be sufficient to change the accretion by a similar factor , if indeed resolution plays a significant role in the accretion processes we model .",
    "we will discuss such issues in section [ sec : stellar - env ] .      .",
    "figures [ fig : masstransw ] and [ fig : masstransc ] show the mass accreted by each of the circumstellar disks as a function of time for the various simulations in our study . for purposes of defining the `` circumstellar disks '' for the primary and secondary stars , we define an outer boundary to that environment to be 50% larger than the radius defined as the last stable orbit by @xcite . for each of the wide binary simulations ,",
    "the total mass transfered into each of the circumstellar disks over the 6500  yr duration of the runs is comparable in magnitude to the assumed initial disk masses themselves .",
    "accretion occurs preferentially onto the disk around the secondary star for both the wide and close systems , and for both eccentric and circular orbits .",
    "the torus - only models generate higher accretion rates than do the torus / disk models , presumably because the higher mass concentration in the inner circumbinary region is more readily available for transfer inward .    for the close binaries , mass transfer occurs at rates some @xmath8 times lower than occurs for corresponding simulations with wide orbits , so that only a small fraction of the initial disk masses are replaced over the lifetimes of the simulations . at early times in these simulations",
    ", mass actually appears to be transfered out of the circumstellar disks .",
    "this is , however , merely a consequence of the initial spreading of the disks away from their initial condition and the artificial limit we imposed to define the disk edge .",
    "the accretion rates in these configurations are low enough to show small , apparent oscillations in the calculated disk masses for the eccentric orbit case ( fig [ fig : masstransc ] ) .",
    "in fact , these oscillations are more likely due to the changes in the disk s spatial dimensions at different phases of its orbit .",
    "such ` flexing ' also causes a small fraction of the disk mass to migrate outwards temporarily , beyond the limiting radius we have defined for the disk edge , before moving again into closer proximity to its host star .",
    "eccentric orbital motion enhances the time averaged accretion rates over those observed for circular orbit systems , with rates a factor of @xmath166 higher in an eccentric orbit system than in an otherwise identical circular orbit system .",
    "in addition , for the eccentric wide binaries , accretion is highly episodic , with substantial mass transfer occuring in bursts some 30 - 40  yr in duration and relatively little transfer occuring at other times .",
    "these bursts reflect the periodic gravitational perturbations of the torus by the stars as they travel closer and further from its inner edge and excite spiral structures there . as described in sections [",
    "sec : wide - morph ] and [ sec : circstar - conf ] , spiral structures generated in the circumbinary disk by the action of the binary fall through the otherwise cleared gap region outside the binary orbit . as they travel through the circumstellar environment , a portion of their length may encounter one or the other circumstellar disks and by accreted by it . while similar features form in the simulations with @xmath2  au ( albeit much weaker ) , the trajectories of the spiral structures through the gap region do not intersect with the circumstellar disks due both to the smaller spatial extent of the disks and to their greater distance from the torus itself .    due to the evident variability in the magnitude of the accretion events from orbit to orbit , we have not attempted a detailed analysis of their exact timing relative to the binary s orbital phase .",
    "we note however that the bursts do vary from orbit to orbit , as does the instantaneous accretion rate and total mass accreted during one event . typically , the events begin at orbital phases prior to orbital periapse and reach their maximum intensity near periapse , declining again as the stars recede from each other",
    ". the timing does not appear to be strongly related to the binary motion itself , but rather to the time required for material originating outside the circumstellar environments to travel inwards far enough to be accreted into one or the other circumstellar disk .",
    "in addition to mass transfer into the circumstellar environment from the torus , mass leaves the circumstellar disks and accretes onto the stars .",
    "figures [ fig : massaccw ] and [ fig : massaccc ] show the total mass accreted onto the stars from their disks as functions of time , for the wide and close series of simulations , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the episodic accretion patterns of mass entering the circumstellar disks , accretion onto the stars exhibits no periodicities or outburts , apart from an initial transient period during which the disk material loses its memory of its initial condition and moves towards a more physically appropriate distribution .    for the wide binary simulations , accretion rates after the initial transient fall between @xmath167/yr for the @xmath4 series , and approximately half those rates for the @xmath3 series .",
    "the eccentric orbit models each exhibit a slight increase in rates at late times , while the @xmath3 models remain steady at near constant rates . given the larger accretion rates _ into _",
    "the circumstellar disks in the eccentric orbit simulations , increases in the accretion rates _ out of _ those same disks is a natural consequence as the larger material volume evolves along the same evolutionary path .",
    "exactly the opposite effect is true of the close orbit models . in those cases ,",
    "the initially rapid mass accretion transient drains a substantial fraction of the mass from the disks . because this material is not replaced as rapidly ( see section [ sec : acc - onto - disks ] , above ) , the disks become depleted of material ( see section [ sec : diskmasses ] below ) and the accretion onto the stars continues to slow down for the entire duration of the simulations .    in all of our simulations , the resolution of the circumstellar disks is extremely coarse .",
    "of the nearly @xmath168 million particles employed in our high resolution simulations , only about 20000 are initially allocated to the circumstellar disks and , as we shall see in section [ sec : diskmasses ] below , that number does not increase substantially over the life of the runs .",
    "because of this low resolution , the viscous dissipation originating from numerical sources is quite large . in order to ensure that our conclusions regarding the accretion rates through the disk are valid , we must therefore demonstrate that those accretion rates are not sensitive to the numerical viscosity inherent in the simulations themselves rather than to physical processes present in the actual system we are modeling .    to this end",
    ", we ran identical physical models at two different resolutions , and have included both the low and high resolution results in figures [ fig : massaccw ] and [ fig : massaccc ] . in every case , apart from a larger rate of accretion during the initial transient , the cumulative mass accreted onto the stars for the low resolution variant follows a curve with an essentially identical slope to its high resolution counterpart .",
    "we conclude that our results are not sensitive to the high numerical dissipation caused by the limited resolution of the circumstellar environment .",
    "our conclusions based on these results are therefore also insensitive to the resolution .",
    "although quantifying the mass accretion into and out of the circumstellar disks as functions of time are important measures of the system , by themselves they are incomplete because they do not specify the mass contained in the disk at any given time .",
    "figures [ fig : massdiskw ] and [ fig : massdiskc ] show the mass of the disks orbiting the primary and secondary stars as a function of time , for the full set of wide and close simulations in our study . in each case , the most significant changes in the disk masses over the first @xmath169  yr are due to the transient redistribution of disk material as it loses memory of its initial condition .",
    "thereafter , and as the circumbinary material begins to exhibit activity , disks in the wide , eccentric orbit models exhibit periodic accretion events , which correspond to the orbital motion of the binary .",
    "in contrast , the disk masses in simulations where the orbital eccentricity is zero settle into steady states with little variation over time .    for the close orbit models ,",
    "the masses of the circumstellar disks continues to decrease for both the @xmath4 and @xmath3 series of simulations over the entire duration of the runs . after the 6500  yr lifetime of the simulations , the masses of both circumstellar disks",
    "has fallen to values an order of magnitude or more lower than their initial masses .",
    "we anticipate that the disks would have been entirely accreted within a comparatively short time of additional evolution .",
    "further evolution was not possible however , because the number of particles remaining in the circumstellar disks decreased to such an extent that instabliities developed in the time step controls for the simulations ( due to the poor resolution of the disks ) .",
    "little forward progress of the simulations was possible under such conditions , and we therefore terminated them . because of the larger mass accretion during the initial transient , our lower resolution runs could only be run for about two orbits of the circumbinary torus , much earlier than was required for the higher resolution realizations .",
    "so far , we have described the behavior of simulations with initial conditions specified to be very similar to , but we have not yet discussed in any depth , direct comparisons of our results to it .",
    "other systems similar to  also exist , to which the results of our simulations may be suitably generalized as well . of these , one of the most similar is uy  aur , with the recent discussions of @xcite providing the most comprehensive description of the system to date .",
    "the similarities between it and the  system are striking , both in the data themselves , and in the difficulties experienced in trying to reconcile them with a single self - consistent model of the system .",
    "although the uy  aur binary has a wider separation and its disks much lower masses , both systems exhibit a remarkably similar inventory of features otherwise .",
    "such features include structures in the circumbinary and circumstellar environments , streamers and stellar orbit planes which may be misaligned with the circumbinary disk if , as @xcite propose , the system is actually a higher order multiple rather than a binary .",
    "here , we discuss comparisons of our results with observations of  and make a number of conclusions about the system and its evolution , with an implicit understanding that the results will be applicable to a larger class of hierarchical multiple systems of similar character .",
    "the observed circumbinary torus of  contains a number of features @xcite , including spokes , gaps , variations in brightness and torus width at different position angles along the torus .",
    "other work ( e.g. gds99 ) , using high resolution interferometry , has shown that the edges of the torus are no more than @xmath10  au in radial extent . despite these observations ,",
    "detailed characterization of the structures and attribution to specific causes is difficult because the features themselves approach size scales comparable to the resolution limits of the telescopes .",
    "while similar constraints apply to our simulations , the spatial scale at which we are constrained is far smaller , thereby permitting both comparisons to be made , as well as , to some extent , predictions of types of features that may be revealed by still higher resolution observations .",
    "figure [ fig : wide - ecc - closeup ] shows a blowup of one panel of the mosaic in figure [ fig : wide - ecc - manyorb ] , along with a snapshot of the system at the preceding periapse passage of the binary .",
    "two streamers are clearly visible in the gap region between the circumstellar material and torus , particularly in the periapse image , which extend outwards to the torus and join with it .",
    "the streamers remain distinguishable as coherent structures for well over a full revolution around the system and , as we will discuss in more detail in section [ sec : evo - circumstar ] , they do not persist as stable structures over the course of the binary s or torus orbit . instead , they travel through the gap region , with a small portion impacting the circumstellar disks , but with the largest fraction of material contained in the streamer simply traveling outwards again , where it rejoins the torus .",
    "just such behavior has occured in the time leading up to the apoapse snapshot , where the streamers no longer extend all the way inwards to the stars , but instead appear effectively as the torus inner boundary . at this time",
    ", portions of each streamer also exhibit small scale structure , particularly at the lower left and upper right portion of the gap , due to the fact that as they traveled these components have been stretched to the largest extent .    even after reentering the torus",
    ", the structures themselves do not lose coherence .",
    "instead , they continue to propagate as distinct entities , interacting with other streamers already present , which were generated during previous orbits of the binary .",
    "as is clear from these images , as well as similar panels in figure [ fig : wide - ecc - manyorb ] , the resulting torus is far from a smooth , azimuth invariant entity .",
    "the combined density structures continue to stretch and deform as they evolve further . in some portions of the torus ,",
    "the remmants of multiple streamers converge to form closely connected filaments . in others , few such filamants are found .",
    "each of these features is defined by very distinct edges , which appear both as its inner and outer boundaries and also as fine structure entirely within the main body of the torus .",
    "eventually , the features reach the outer edges of the torus , where they effectively define its outer edge .",
    "the torus internal structure as seen in our simulations invites comparison with the various structure observed in the  system .",
    "most easily compared are the streamers which appear in the gap region itself .",
    "although many observations are at the limits of what can be observed , so that their interpretations are not without ambiguities , some , more recent observations , such as those of @xcite and @xcite have begun to remove those uncertainties .",
    "for example , @xcite interpret their observations of emissions from hot gas as evidence for streamers of material infalling onto circumstellar material , which has been shock heated as it impacted the circumstellar disks .",
    "long wavelength observations of @xcite reinforce this interpretation , showing dust emission extending inwards from the torus to the circumstellar environments where the hot gas resides .",
    "correspondence between the streamers in our simulations and these features in the observed system are easily made , particularly for the images shown near periapse , for which the streamers extend inwards all the way to the circumstellar disks .",
    "some portions are also visible as a small ` bar ' in the region extending between the binary components themselves .",
    "the short time scales over which the features in our simulations exist before dissipating back into the torus , also correspond well with the locations where the hot material is observed , in locations where its presence can not be explained except as a dynamically transient phenomenon .",
    "finally , the presence of high temperature material in the outer portions of the disks ( see figure [ fig : disk - temps ] , above ) , shows that the accretion streams do , indeed , generate exactly the observed behavior pattern .    within the torus ,",
    "the distribution of spiral structure as a function of azimuth is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "for example , in the periapse image , while some comparatively low density structures are visible in the image both to the left and right of the stars , far higher density structures ( yellow and red in the images ) are visible above and below them .",
    "as discussed in sections [ sec : wide - morph ] and [ sec : close - morph ] , such structures are visible over the entire duration of the simulations , and change their appearance as system evolves .",
    "although the orbital timescales in the torus are thousands of years , the time scales for changes are far shorter , as evidenced by the marked differences between the two images in figure [ fig : wide - ecc - closeup ] , which are separated in time by @xmath170  yr . from the earlier image to the later , the large amplitude spiral arms have both traveled forwards in their orbits , and changed in shape .",
    "for example , the large spiral arm near the top of each image is longer and more dense in the top image than in the bottom .",
    "similarly , the spiral arm appearing in the bottom left quadrant of each image is of higher density and angular extent in the top image than in the bottom .",
    "the features in our simulations are qualitatively similar to the descriptions of depressions , filaments and gaps in the hst images discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , although the features are quite clear in our simulations , the interpretation of the features in the observations themselves less so , due simply to the fact that they are near the detection limits of the telescope , where they are difficult to distinguish from various sources of noise .",
    "the features in our simulations are natural consequences of the dynamical activity generated by the motion of binary and here , we make tentative identifications of these features with those reported in the  system .",
    "further observations would substantially bolster the case for such identifications , but would require substantially more finely resolved images that are presently available .",
    "we anticipate that any such improved observations , repeated over the course of multi - decade timescales , may also begin to resolve variability of the systems appearance in time , though such an observing program would be an extremely challenging endeavor .    finally ,",
    "the streamers , and their coherence over long periods of time , provide a natural explanation for the observed sharply defined edges of the  torus . in figure",
    "[ fig : dens - lineouts ] , we show the radial profiles of the surface density in the torus along three rays extending outwards from the system barycenter , each derived from the surface density mappings described in section [ sec : quantitative ] , below . the high density regions in the profiles correspond to slices through the various spiral structures visible in figure [ fig : wide - ecc - closeup ] , and their sharply defined edges to their inner and outer extents along the ray .",
    "for example , the green curves , corresponding to two rays extending upwards in the two images each intersect a spiral arm whose outer edge is found just inside 250  au in the top panel , and just inside 260  au in the bottom . at those locations , the surface density decreases abruptly from @xmath171  gm/@xmath105 to @xmath154  gm/@xmath105 over a spatial scale of @xmath172  au .",
    "similar features are present at various other locations in the profiles , with those in the radially inner portions corresponding to streamers located within the gap intersecting the rays , while those at larger distances corresponding to larger scale spiral disturbances within the torus itself . in some cases , the inner edge appears more sharply defined , as is the case for the feature at @xmath173  au along the 45  ray in the upper panel . in others , the outer edge is sharper , as discussed above for the 90  rays .",
    "features with lower surface densities and lower contrasts are also present in the profiles , extending to distances as far as @xmath174  au from the system barycenter .",
    "each of the profiles include density contrasts of up to factors of @xmath175 , over spatial scales of @xmath172  au in extent along the ray .",
    "these scales are comparable to or smaller than the @xmath10  au widths derived for the inner and outer ring edge width by @xcite and @xcite for the  system .",
    "each of these edge width derivations are based on observations that approached the resolution limits of the telescopes themselves so that , in principle at least , the widths might be expected to be significantly narrower . on the other hand , the smoothing lengths of the sph particles located in these regions is @xmath176  au , and we conclude that both the spiral structures and their edges are well resolved in our simulations .",
    "therefore , given the results of our simulations , we expect that future observations will fully resolve the edge structure at size scales of a few au .",
    "in section [ sec : circumbin ] we described the process by which we defined initial conditions for the torus and disk and noted that determination of self consistent initial conditions ( i.e. rotation velocities consistent with the implied pressure and gravitational forces ) were difficult to specify self consistently at the interface between the two components .",
    "the sharp density gradients produced correspondingly large pressure gradients that generated difficulties in defining self consistent orbit velocities near the interface . to sidestep the inconsistencies ,",
    "we employed the ` workaround ' of widening the interface in our initial condition over a radial region some @xmath177 the observed width of the interface . given the the sharp interfaces described this section , a much more palatable physical model for interpreting the data is that the sharpness of the inner and outer edges of the torus is not a feature of a cylindrically symmetric distribution of material in rotational equilibrium , but is more likely simply to be due to the spiral structures generated by the actions of the binary on the torus and of self gravitating disturbances .",
    "in the discussion above , we noted that in many of our simulations the circumbinary torus fragmented into one or more massive objects .",
    "we did not however , discuss the significance of those objects , either in the context of their significance from a numerical standpoint , or in the context of what they might mean for the  system .",
    "we now consider such questions .      of primary importance in evaluating our results is to answer the question of whether or not the fragments are simply artifacts of our numerical methods or of deficiencies in the physical assumptions used to model the system .",
    "our first task , then , is to determine whether or not the simulations obey known requirements for resolving fragmentation , such as those described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n06 ) .",
    "the most pertinent of these criteria is the requirement that the fragments be resolved by a sufficiently large number of particles , both as they form and afterwards .",
    "a quantification of ` sufficiently large ' is that the locally value of the ` toomre mass ' , as defined in n06 , be resolved by no fewer than @xmath178 the number of sph neighbor particles , which corresponds to about 200 particles in 2d .",
    "we find that the conditions within the fragments produced in our simulations are such that the toomre mass reaches its smallest values of @xmath10  in the highest density portions of a fragment .",
    "given the torus mass and the particle counts in our simulations , the mass of a single sph particle is @xmath179 .",
    "the ratio of these two masses is approximately 10@xmath180far higher than the required number of sph neighbors , and we conclude that the fragmentation is well resolved by our simulations .",
    "additional considerations for checking the sensitivity of our simulations to various numerical and physical parameters are found in a series of papers by meru & bate . in @xcite , they find that , in addition to the result of @xcite that disks fragment if their cooling timescale is shorter than @xmath181 orbit periods ( depending on the adiabatic exponent , @xmath68 ) , fragmentation is also sensitive to a variety of other physical parameters .",
    "in addition to the cooling timescale , they examine the sensitivity of fragmentation in disk simulations to the opacity in models with radiative cooling , and to the mass and temperature profiles in the disk .",
    "they determine an empirical relationship between the cooling timescale required for fragmentation and the mass distribution and also note that disks heated by external radiation , from e.g. stellar irradiation ( as are those in our models ) , tend to be less likely to fragment due to the additional heating .",
    "later however , in @xcite , they realized that their previous results were sensitive not only to changes in the various physical models , but also to the number of sph particles used to resolve the disks in their simulations .",
    "they concluded that in many cases , their simulations were not converged numerically , and questioned whether any numerical simulations that included radiative transport could possibly converge to a result which accurately modeled fragmentation in circumstellar disks .",
    "after a further investigation @xcite , they revise their initial conclusion to note that fragmentation can be resolved , but depends strongly on the magnitude of the artificial viscosity employed . are these conditions important for the simulations described in our work ?",
    "since our models also include an approximate radiative cooling model , they too may be affected by a similar deficiency , and we therefore explore that possibility here .",
    "we note first , that meru & bate did not discuss the application of any of the n06 resolution criteria to their results .",
    "given this fact , we begin with such a comparison in order to understand whether the n06 conditions are more or less restrictive than the convergence criteria they describe .",
    "the condition most directly available for comparison in the various meru & bate works is the n06 requirement that the vertical structure in 3d disks be resolved by at least @xmath182  sph smoothing lengths per disk scale height , at the disk midplane .",
    "figure 10 of @xcite shows this quantity , and we observe that the azimuth averaged values of the ratio @xmath183 ( smoothing length over scale height  the inverse of the quoted n06 criterion ) , are larger than the required 1/4 for all but the outer portions of the two million particle run shown . based on this observation , we conclude that their simulations with two million particles are at best marginally resolved in their outer regions , while the inner regions and those runs with fewer particles are insufficiently resolved .",
    "the direct consequence , as shown in n06 , is that the mass densities in the disk midplane in those runs will under - shoot their physically correct ( i.e. fully resolved ) values by a factor of as much as 30% when @xmath184",
    ". this condition will be true for all of the simulations in @xcite and many in their later works @xcite as well .",
    "the effect such errors will induce in other physics based quantities or the overall outcome of a given simulation is difficult to assess directly . it is noteworthy however that the sensitivities they describe are much less pronounced above the 2 million particle threshhold @xcite at which the vertical structure criterion of n06 is marginally satisfied in the outer parts of their disks .",
    "we conclude that the trends in their simulations are likely to be manifestations of numerical inaccuracies similar to those underlying the n06 vertical structure resolution requirement .",
    "this conclusion , and the arguments on which it is based , is also shared by @xcite . in addition , those authors argue that one possible origin for the resolution sensitivity may lie in resolution dependent changes in the thermal energy input supplied by the bulk artificial viscosity , even when that contribution is small overall .",
    "they emphasize however that the case for such a mechanism is ambiguous , because some simulations , at high resolution and for which their model predicts fragmentation , actually do not fragment . that absence",
    "is then taken as evidence for physical mechanisms to suppress fragmentation .",
    "we have discussed the importance of two such mechanisms in our work ( radiative heating and stirring generated by the binary interactions ) , and so discount the resolution criterian in meru & bate , in favor of satisfying the n06 toomre mass criterion directly , as the best indicator that numerically induced fragmentation is absent in our simulations .      given that our simulations do not contain numerical deficiencies which generate fragmentation",
    ", we now discuss the significance of the relevant physical models and their contribution to fragmentation .",
    "fragmentation occurs when an imbalance betweeen gravitational and pressure forces develops which favors gravitational forces in some volume so that it begins to collapse , typically on timescales of a few orbits @xcite .",
    "the imbalance develops when either insufficient internal energy is absorbed by the disk via radiative heating , or is generated in it by dissipation of kinetic energy , or when cooling permits internal energy to escape more quickly than it can be replaced .",
    "each of these processes decrease the gas pressure through the equation of state , and each are strongly time dependent in character , varying as the disk evolves .",
    "all of our simulations exhibit strong spiral structures generated by the combination of self gravitating instabilities and the tidal interactions with the binary .",
    "some also produce fragments on short timescales compared to the system lifetime .",
    "we conclude that our simulations model systems lie very near their fragmentation boundary , with some configurations being slightly more susceptible to fragmentation and others slightly less so .",
    "in contrast , and although marked structure exists , the  system is not known to contain any well defined fragments within its torus , even though the observed torus conditions imply a strongly self gravitating structure .",
    "this means that the balance between heating and cooling must be very finely held , because the instabilities are neither fully suppressed , nor do they grow to sufficient amplitude to generate fragements .",
    "further , this balance has been sustained over a long time , in spite of the sensitive time dependence noted in @xcite , since the system lifetime is long compared to the @xmath5few orbit timescale required for fragmentation to occur . given",
    "that our simulations model configurations defined to be very similar to , such that similar physical behaviors are expected in both , we conclude that the balance between heating and cooling is much more finely held in reality than is possible for our models to reproduce .    nevertheless , two important , additional conclusions about the system are possible based on our results .",
    "first , we recall our conclusions above that large scale structures seen in all of our simulations owe their origin not only to the tidal action of the binary but also to self gravitating instabilities in the torus .",
    "although no clear pattern emerges from our simulations that would indicate which configurations are more likely to generate fragments in the  system , their presence in systems with many different binary orbital parameters indicate that the conditions are generally favorable for fragmentation .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the  system itself is very near its fragmentation boundary .",
    "given our results however , we can not predict whether or not such an outcome actually will occur .",
    "second , we conclude that the combined energy input from the radiative heating from the stars and the stirring action of the binary are responsible for a large fraction of the thermal energy input into the torus , and thereby play an important role in its long term stability .",
    "this is demonstrated by comparing the simulations described in section [ sec : heatoff ] . in the first",
    ", we model a single star of the same mass and luminosity as the combined masses and luminosities of the binary stars in our other simulations , but with the same torus . in the second , we model a binary while omitting the stellar radiative heating source . the torus is marginally stable with an embedded binary that includes heating , producing none or at most one or two fragments within the several orbit time frame of the simulations . in contrast , removing either the radiative heating or the tidal stirring causes the torus to become violently unstable , producing nearly 40 fragments in less than a single torus orbit .",
    "such an outcome clearly demonstrates both the unphysical nature of the evolution where those processes are absent and , at the same time , their importance where they are present .",
    "gds99 report an inclination of 37@xmath181 degrees for the  torus relative to the line of sight .",
    "this value is derived from the observations by deprojecting the observed eccentric appearance of the circumbinary torus into a circular shape . given this inclination ,",
    "attempts to fit the available astrometric data for the binary s orbit presently remain somewhat ambiguous . if an orbit coplanar with a circular torus is assumed , then the best fit orbital parameters are @xmath185  au and @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these parameters prove to be somewhat unsatisfactory from the point of view that the semi - major axis is smaller than is expected based on dynamical arguments and the position of the inner edge of the torus .    recognizing this shortcoming , the same authors and others fit for the orbital parameters under the relaxed assumption that the planes of the stellar orbit and the torus may be misaligned . in this case",
    ", @xcite determined best fit orbit parameters of @xmath9  au , @xmath187 and a mutual inclination of @xmath188  degrees .",
    "they also report a second family of fits with mutual inclinations of nearly 90 degrees , but find that the disk in such systems is either disrupted entirely or becomes very thick .",
    "following similar arguments regarding alignment , the later analysis of @xcite found the ` most plausible ' orbit parameters to be @xmath189  au and @xmath190 , with a relative inclination between the two planes of @xmath191 degrees .    under both sets of assumptions however , the fitted orbital parameters still remain unsatisfactory based on the dynamical argument that a substantial misalignment between the stars and torus would quickly generate a warp in the torus , while no such feature is observed .",
    "given the analysis of section [ sec : quantitative ] , we believe that the data and the analyses of them may be fully reconciled if we relax the assumption that the  torus is circular , rather than the assumption that the torus and binary orbit planes are inclined with respect to each other .",
    "under this alternate assumption , deprojection of the torus actual eccentric shape into a circular shape results in an erroneous determination of its inclination .",
    "then , the perceived misalignment is simply a consequence of the incorrect determination of the torus inclination , rather than a property of the system itself",
    ".    this alternate assumption will be plausible if the mutual inclination determined from the fit is comparable to the inclination derived from misinterpreting an elliptical torus as a circular torus inclined at an angle , @xmath84 , with respect to the line of sight .",
    "for a given ellipse which is interpreted as a circle , the inferred inclination is related to the true eccentricity , @xmath149 , via the equation @xmath192 therefore , given a torus with eccentricity @xmath4 , its inclination would be perceived to be @xmath193 degrees .",
    "similarly , a torus with @xmath160 or @xmath159 would be perceived to have an inclination of @xmath194 or @xmath195 degrees , respectively .",
    "the same error is made if some other plane defines the torus absolute orientation , rather than the plane of the sky . in the case of the  system , this plane can be specified as the plane defining the orbit of the two stars in the binary .",
    "the mutual inclinations derived in each of the analyses above fall well within the range of ` false ' inclinations which could be attributed to misinterpreting the eccentric shape of the torus itself . on this basis",
    ", we conclude that the ambiguity in orbit parameters can be resolved in favor of the larger semi - major axis .",
    "this conclusion restores consistency between the observations of the torus dimensions  specifically the location of its inner edge  and the dynamical results of @xcite , which predict a wide binary orbit based on the location of lindblad resonances that drive tidal truncation .",
    "it is further reinforced by the fact that only the circumstellar disks in our @xmath1  au simulations remain massive enough to remain consistent with the masses derived from observations .",
    "the disk masses in all of our simulations with @xmath2  au decrease quickly to much smaller values due to the combination of losses through accretion onto the stars and the lack of replenishing material accreting onto them from the circumbinary environment .",
    "observations indicating the presence of accretion streams reinforces our conclusion further , for two reasons .",
    "first , such streams are essentially non - existent in our @xmath2  au simulations , but ubiquitous in our @xmath1 simulations , particularly in the @xmath4 run .",
    "second , assuming an @xmath1  au semi - major axis , the  system must be relatively close to its periapse passage , given its apparent separation .",
    "this is important because our simulations indicate that accretion streams extending inward to the circumstellar disks occur only around this time , becoming weaker or entirely absent at other orbital phases .",
    "thus , the simulations and observations suggest the same consistent model for the system itself .",
    "we note that an important consequence of adapting this assumption is that deprojection of the apparent shape of the  torus becomes a much less accurate method of determining the system s actual inclination .",
    "the difficulty is compounded by the fact that the eccentricity of the torus varies widely and its orientation is not correlated with the orientation of that of the binary s orbit plane .",
    "other constraints will be required in order to disambiguate the torus actual inclination and its actual eccentricity .",
    "observations of the  system show conclusive evidence both for circumstellar material and for accretion into the circumstellar environment .",
    "both hot and cold material are observed @xcite in a region extending some tens of au from the stars , in both circumstellar disks and in accretion streams .",
    "unfortunately , the observations extend over only a very short time window in comparison to a full orbit of the binary , or even a full periapse passage .",
    "they therefore define only a snapshot of the system rather than a full evolutionary picture of its behavior over time . given the similarities we have already noted between our wide orbit simulations and those observed in , it will be useful to apply the comparisons first to make interpretations of the current state of the system in the context of an evolutionary model , and then to make predictions of its behavior as it evolves in the future .",
    "above , we concluded that the degeneracy in the orbital motion data for the stars in the  system can be resolved in favor of an orbit with @xmath9  au .",
    "this conclusion is further reinforced by the presence of significant amounts of material in the circumstellar environment of  because mass accretes into the circumstellar environments at rates sufficient to sustain and even grow the disks _ only _ in our wide orbit simulations .",
    "little accretion occurs in the close orbit runs .",
    "instead , mass transfer into the circumstellar disks is very limited in those models and the disks initially assumed to be present quickly accrete onto the stars , almost entirely emptying them of material .",
    "these conditions are inconsistent with the observations of features extending tens of au from the stars in the  system .",
    "the presence and sizes of the circumstellar disks are also consistent with the interactions by each component of the system on the other , which lead to tidal truncation of the circumstellar disks at sizes comparable to the dynamical stability limit described by @xcite and shown numerically by @xcite .",
    "the episodic accretion seen in our eccentric binary simulations is quite reminiscent of the same feature in the work of @xcite . as in their work , we find that accretion occurs preferentially onto the secondary component and that , due to this preference , the mass ratio between the components will tend towards equality over long periods . the same conclusion was drawn in @xcite , for the long term , time averaged accretion rates from massless , circumbinary disks with isothermal evolution assuming temperatures both warmer and colder than in our study .    given that the  system is in a wide orbit , the fits provided in @xcite show that the stars are approaching their periapse passage , rather than receding from it .",
    "examination of our simulations ( e.g. panels 6 - 8 of figure [ fig : wide - ecc-1orb ] ) show that at this time the circumstellar environment should include a significant amount of material originating in the accretion streams and wrapping around the disks and extending outwards to the torus .",
    "a similarly important feature of the system is that the circumstellar accretion disks should exhibit spiral structures and other asymmetries , driven by the tidal interactions of the binary components .",
    "both classes of features are consistent with the observations .",
    "to these interpretations of the system s short term state , we add the longer term prediction that , over the duration of the periapse passage , as much as a few tenths of a jupiter mass will accrete onto the circumstellar disks of the  system , preferentially onto the secondary component , as shown in figure [ fig : masstransw ] .    an important feature of the  system that our simulations do not reproduce is that the mass determined for the disk around the secondary component is substantially less than that around the primary component ( as discussed , e.g. , by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our simulations ,",
    "the reverse is true ",
    "mass accretes preferentially onto the disk around the secondary , and its mass increases to @xmath165 times that of the disk around the primary ( figure [ fig : massdiskw ] ) .",
    "should we interpret this inconsistency as an indication that our models should be ruled out as inconsistent with the observations ?",
    "fortunately for our models ,  itself provides the means to reconcile simulation and observation : it simply is not the binary we have modeled .",
    "instead , recent interferometric observations of @xcite have shown that the gg  tau  ab component is itself a binary consisting of two m stars separated by @xmath23  au . unlike the system we modeled , the circumstellar disks in this system will be tidally truncated to radii no larger than about 11.5  au each .",
    "the shorter dynamical times inherent such small disks will lead to correspondingly reduced disk lifetimes and masses , consistent with the observations , even in the presence of rapid replenishment from the accretion streams .",
    "given this confounding factor , the inconsistency between our simulations and the data is to be expected , rather than being evidence for their invalidity .",
    "after its accretion into one or the other circumstellar disk , mass continues to migrate through the disk , ultimately accreting onto the star around which it orbited .",
    "accretion rates onto the stars in  have been determined by @xcite ( who derive a rate of @xmath196/yr ) and @xcite ( who derive a rate of @xmath197/yr ) and are in very good agreement with the rates inferred from our simulations , of a few @xmath198/yr .",
    "each of these works consider only the accretion onto both stars as a sum , rather than onto the individual components .",
    "our results , summed over both stars , fall roughly half way between the two observational determinations , supporting the conclusion that our simulations accurately model the  system .",
    "our rates , in turn , are about an order of magnitude higher than those computed by @xcite . while we have not investigated the origin of the differences between our results and theirs",
    ", we note that our initial setup was significantly different from theirs , as was our numerical method .",
    "the accretion rates correspond , in numerical terms , to rates of 1 - 2 particles per year , or several hundred per binary orbit . given this level of discreteness",
    ", such values suggest that we should consider the accretion in our simulations to be , at least in part , a phenomenon governed by numerical processes rather than physics .",
    "perhaps surprisingly however , the rates do not appear to be strongly correlated to resolution .",
    "accretion driven primarily by numerical viscosity for example , should be proportional to the particle smoothing length , through equation [ eq : balsara ] , and in turn to the square root ( in 2d ) of the number of particles . instead , both the high and low resolution variants of the same physical configuration return similar patterns of accretion over time .",
    "we conclude , due to this relative insensitivity , that the accretion is not driven primarily by viscous processes derived from numerial effects , but rather by other physical processes , such as gravitational torques .",
    "mass transfer into the circumstellar disks occurs at rates similar to those for stellar accretion for wide systems but at much lower rates in the close systems .",
    "thus , concerns similar to those noted for the stellar accretion must be addressed for these cases as well .",
    "@xcite studied the sensitivity of the mass transfer rates into circumstellar environments to the resolution employed in 2d sph simulations .",
    "they found that rates were numerically converged in simulations where the ratio of particle smoothing length to disk scale height fell in the range @xmath199 near roche radii of the stars .",
    "this occured at accretion rates of a few hundred particles per binary orbit . in our high resolution runs",
    ", we find that @xmath200 in this region .",
    "given the similarity in these parameters between their work and ours , we conclude that the mass transfer rates in our simulations are also converged .",
    "in contrast , the streams in the close orbit systems are far less massive and are correspondingly more poorly resolved",
    ". the comparatively poorer resolution of the mass transfer will not be fatal to our conclusion that the rates are much lower than the wide orbit runs , because the simulations are based on identical initial configurations of the circumbinary material .",
    "thus , the weaker streams are simply a consequence of the intrinsic differences between the physical configuration of the stellar and circumstellar material rather than any shortcoming in the numerical realization .",
    "the results we present may be extended to considerations regarding the likelihood for planet formation in  or other multiple systems . from an observational perspective for example , @xcite detect the presence of both cold and hot material in the circumstellar environment of  and interpret the presence of the cold material as evidence for possible planet formation in the system . from a theoretical perspective",
    "however , such a conclusion requires not only the presence of substantial amounts of material in circumstellar disks , but also a mechanism for accumulating that matter into massive , condensed objects on short timescales .",
    "theory suggests that the most likely candidates responsible for forming jovian mass planets and low mass brown dwarfs are either gravitational fragmentation of large scale spiral structure @xcite or coagulation of small solid grains followed by later accretion of additional gas ( i.e.  core accretionsee * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the disks of forming stellar systems .    in n00",
    ", one of us concluded that planet formation in the circumstellar disks of equal mass binary systems with a separation similar to that in the  system was unlikely .",
    "the conclusion was based on the fact that temperatures in the disks were too high either to support gravitational instabilities or to permit solid grain growth since grains would be vaporized in large portions of the disks .",
    "it was based on models of a system similar to l1551  irs  5 , a system much younger than  and for which the disks are still relatively massive . to what extent",
    "does a similar conclusion hold for systems like , which has evolved to a much later evolutionary epoch , and for which the circumstellar disks are far less massive ?    in answer to this question , we note that the temperatures seen in figure [ fig : disk - temps ] ( section [ sec : circstar - conf ] , above ) are similar to those reported in n00 , while the disk masses are more than an order of magnitude lower .",
    "the effect of similar temperatures and smaller disk masses will make the disks even more stable against the growth of self gravitating structures , as defined by the value of the toomre @xmath49 parameter , than reported in n00 .",
    "planet formation by way of gravitational fragmentation is therefore suppressed to a correspondingly greater degree .",
    "similarly , high disk temperatures are significant for the core accretion model , because the budget of solids entrained in the gas decreases where temperatures rise above the vaporization temperatures of those solids . in the present instance , the ` ice line ' , at which planet formation via the core accretion model is enhanced by the presence of additional solid material , will lie near to or outside the actual boundaries of the disks .",
    "water ices will therefore not be present within the circumstellar disks of , except perhaps at high altitudes above the midplanes , and planet formation via core accretion will be inhibited .",
    "in addition , while the accretion of new material into the circumstellar environment might be expected to enhance the growth of dust and small solid bodies , the fact that the overall accretion rate through the disk is high will negate this benefit . any accumulations of dust grains and small planetesimals",
    "will quickly be swept along with the overall mass flow through the disk and be lost onto the star .",
    "therefore , based on the same arguments presented in n00 , we can extend the conclusion in n00 to the later stages of evolution typical of .",
    "in extending the n00 conclusion , we are mindful of apparently contradictory data embodied in the detections of planets in mature binary systems ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in many cases , these systems are characterized by semi - major axes similar to that found in making the contradiction more acute .",
    "it can be resolved however , by noting that the companion masses derived for these objects ( or implied for them through their effective temperatures ) are substantially lower than those reported for the primaries and that few planets in binaries with near equal mass ratios were found .",
    "such systems are therefore distinct from the cases considered here and our conclusion does not apply .",
    "further contradictions emerge however , when observations of young systems are accounted for , such as is seen in @xcite , who show that @xmath201 of young , close binary systems have lost their circumstellar disks by the time they are 1 - 2myr in age , without regard to stellar mass ratios .",
    "they conclude that planet formation will be less likely in binary s compared to single stars .",
    "such contradictions suggest that a comparative study of the two classes of systems ( of equal and unequal mass components ) would be of great interest , to explore the physical reasons for the dichotomy between the presence of planets in unequal mass binary systems and their paucity in equal mass systems .",
    "given these dynamical constraints , we conclude that the cold material observed by @xcite has yet to interact substantially with the circumstellar environment or , for some portion , will soon return to the circumbinary torus as parts of the accretion stream moves out of the circumstellar environment .",
    "we can not therefore confirm their conclusion that its presence in the circumstellar environment is evidence for planet formation .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of both cold and hot material will remain of considerable interest for evolutionary models because together they define a reservior of nearly pristine material which has either recently undergone , or will soon undergo , its first significant heating event .",
    "it may therefore retain signatures of the processes important during that event .    in a comparison study of single and moderate separation binary systems ,",
    "@xcite conclude that the first stages of planet formation ",
    "grain growth  will not be affected by the presence or absence of a binary companion .",
    "they base their conclusions on the lack of observed differences between the 10@xmath202 m silicate features seen in the spectra of disks around stars in single and multiple systems .",
    "while the presence of silicates and other solids in disks is certainly a requirement for the formation of planets , in and of itself , simple presence is insufficient to differentiate between a system where planet formation is more likely and a similar system where planet formation is less likely .",
    "these features may instead trace material which is unlikely to become important for planet formation because of its short lifetime in the disks .",
    "we believe that such is the case in the  system .",
    "having completed our study of systems configured to be similar to  and discussed their physical significance in relation it , we now summararize our results and suggest future studies that may profitably build on ours .      we have modeled the evolution of a forming binary star system , configured to resemble the  system , using the sph code vine .",
    "the system consists of two stars , each surrounded by a circumstellar disk and in orbit around each other , with a circumbinary torus@xmath0disk structure in orbit around the combined system .",
    "our simulations include the self - gravity of the disk material , external heating of the gas due to radiation from two stars and radiative cooling from the disks .",
    "we follow the evolution of a suite of systems for @xmath56500 - 7500  yr , corresponding to about three orbits of the torus around the center of mass .",
    "we find that strong spiral structures develop in the torus due to the stirring action of the binary and to its own self gravity .",
    "the spiral structures are well defined in space , are characterized by edges of @xmath203  au in width and frequently extend more than 360  around the center of mass .",
    "we interpret the observations of sharply defined structures in the  torus as evidence for such spiral structures .",
    "the spiral structures propagate outwards over time , generating a net outward mass flux extending into the low density circumbinary disk surrounding the torus . at large distances , they lose coherence , and we interpret the presence of the disk component of the circumbinary material as an excretion feature produced as the spiral structures transport mass to that region . in our torus - only configurations ,",
    "about 15% of the mass of the torus moves outwards over the @xmath204  yr duration of our simulations  about half of the observed mass of the present disk ( 30% of the torus mass ) .",
    "the rates are much lower in the torus@xmath0disk initial configuration , and we expect that on a longer timescales , as the disk component gains mass , a nearly stationary state is reached between the outwards mass transport into the disk , and the mass escaping from it , through its outer edge or other mechanisms .    structures created at different times frequently interact with one another and , late in the evolution of several simulations , fragment into one or two clumps with initial masses comparable to brown dwarfs . in a model where we replaced the binary with a single star of the same mass , some 38 clumps formed in less than a single orbit of the torus .",
    "we interpret this result as an indication of the importance of the binary s stirring action as a contributor to the thermal energy input of the torus , and as a strong indication of the importance of self gravity in the  torus . the torus changes shape and orientation as the spiral structures propagate through it .",
    "we fit its shape to an ellipse whose eccentricity varies between @xmath205 and an orientation which precesses on timescales comparable to the torus orbit period .",
    "we point out a degeneracy in the interpretation of the data in the calculation of the torus inclination and its eccentricity , if the torus is actually eccentric rather than circular in shape . given this degeneracy , we resolve the question of the supposed misalignment between the  torus and the binary s orbit , by interpreting the data as a coplanar system in which the torus is eccentric , rather than circular .",
    "we simulate systems configured with semi - major axes of either @xmath1  au ( ` wide ' ) or @xmath2  au ( ` close ' ) , and with assumed orbital eccentricity of either @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "although torus structure appears in all configurations , only wide configurations generate substantial streams of material extending inward to the circumstellar disks . a small fraction of the material in these streams accretes into the circumstellar environment , with the remainder returning to the torus . in wide binary configurations , and over the time span of our simulations ,",
    "mass comparable to the disks themselves is accreted onto both primary and secondary components .",
    "mass accretes preferentially onto the secondary at steady rates in @xmath3 configurations , but is episodic in @xmath4 configurations with highest rates occuring near binary periapse .",
    "in contrast to the wide configurations , the streams in close binary configurations contain much less material and the rate of accretion into the circumstellar environment is two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "accretion onto the stars is steady in all cases , at rates sufficient to drain the disks almost entirely of material within the time span of our simulations , if they are not otherwise replenished .",
    "the net mass transport into and out of the disks in the wide binary configurations , produces disk masses which remain steady near their initial values in @xmath3 cases , but double over the same time span in @xmath4 cases . in close binary configurations however , the net mass inflow and outflow is insufficient to replenish the disks before they accrete onto the stars .",
    "replenishment of disk material from the torus in wide orbit configurations can therefore significantly extend the lifetime of the circumstellar disks .",
    "mass replenishment is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for planet formation in the circumstellar disks .",
    "we find that other conditions , such as material temperatures , are not compatible with planet formation in the circumstellar disks , and conclude that planet formation there is unlikely .",
    "given the results of our simulations , we interpret the observations of the  system in favor of the wide , eccentric binary orbit solutions of @xcite and @xcite , for which parameters of @xmath9  au and @xmath186 are derived . in each case , the fits require that the torus and binary orbit be inclined with respect to each other . as noted above , we resolve this inconsistency by interpreting the supposed mutual inclination as an eccentricity in the torus .",
    "we also favor these parameters over the fits otherwise prefered by each of the previous works , namely those with @xmath206  au and @xmath186 , because the circumstellar disks in such systems would be accreted onto their respective stars within a few thousand years , and because material streams in such systems would be far weaker than are observed .",
    "the results presented in this work answer a number of questions regarding the character of the  system , while raising others , and leaving others untouched .",
    "first among the questions raised by our results are the questions of whether the detailed morphology of features in the circumbinary torus as seen in our simulations are actually present in the  system .",
    "the current best resolution observations of the torus provide tantalizing hints that such features do exist , but a definitive statement that such features are present must await higher resolution observations of quality similar to those described by @xcite , for the hl  tau circumstellar disk . another important question concerns planet formation in multiple systems . whether or not any theoretical mechanism presently exists to explain the formation of giant planets in binary systems",
    ", the fact remains that at least a few binary systems , such as @xmath68 cephei @xcite , gi86 @xcite and hd  41004 @xcite , do harbor planets .",
    "therefore some formation mechanism does in fact exist . while we find that accretion into the circumstellar disks occurs rapidly enough so that they can survive for the comparatively long time scales needed to form planets , other conditions , such as temperatures , remain quite unfavorable .",
    "what are the mechanisms still missing from our models that permit such objects to form ? finally , our simulations model the evolution of the ` a ' component of the full  system over a time span extending over only a tiny fraction of its formation time scale and in only two spatial dimensions .",
    "we neglected the full dynamical effects expected to be present in the system , insofar as our results include neither the distant binary ` b ' component of the system , nor the newly discovered tight binary nature of the  b component .",
    "even so , we find large scale morphological changes even over this short time span and restricted dimensionality and physical system .",
    "given the vigor of the activity over such a short time scale , we would expect activity of similar scale over to occur over longer time spans as well , with correspondingly large consequences on the system morphology .",
    "to what extent will 3d effects also play a role in the evolution ? what will be the end state configuration of the system as a whole ? will the components eventually break apart ?",
    "future investigations extending the work presented here will be required in order to answer these questions .",
