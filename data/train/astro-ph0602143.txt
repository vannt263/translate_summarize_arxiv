    "infrared luminous galaxies ( l@xmath3 @xmath4 10@xmath5l@xmath6 ) radiate most of their luminosity as dust emission in the infrared @xcite .",
    "thus , powerful energy sources , e.g. , starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , must be present hidden behind dust . in the local universe , these infrared luminous galaxies dominate the bright end of the luminosity function @xcite . in the distant universe , they dominate the cosmic infrared background emission and have been used to trace the dust - obscured star - formation rate , dust content , and metallicity in the early universe , based on the assumption that they are powered by starbursts @xcite . estimating the agn contribution to their infrared luminosities is therefore important , not only to obtain a full understanding of the nature of these galaxies , but also to study the connections between obscured agns and starbursts in the universe .    in a powerful agn that is obscured along our sightline by dust in a _ torus _",
    "geometry , the hard radiation of agn can photo - ionize clouds along the torus axis , above the torus scale height , and can produce the so - called narrow line regions ( nlrs ; antonucci 1993 ; robson 1996 ) .",
    "since the nlrs show optical spectra that differ from normal star - forming galaxies , such obscured agns should be detectable through optical spectroscopy ( classified as seyfert 2s ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "however , since the nuclear regions of infrared luminous galaxies are very dusty @xcite , virtually all lines of sight can be opaque to the bulk of the ionizing radiation of agns .",
    "in such _ buried _ agns , x - ray dissociation regions ( xdrs ) , which are dominated by low - ionization species @xcite , develop instead of the nlrs , so that it is difficult to find agn signatures using either conventional optical spectroscopy or high - resolution infrared spectroscopic searches for high - excitation forbidden emission lines that originate in the nlrs @xcite . from the spectral shape of the cosmic x - ray background emission",
    ", it is inferred that buried agns are abundant in the universe @xcite ; therefore , establishing a method with which to detect such optically elusive @xcite buried agns is very important .    to find such buried agns , it is necessary to conduct observations at wavelengths with low dust extinction .",
    "infrared @xmath1-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath0 m ) spectroscopy from the ground is one of the most powerful tools for this purpose .",
    "first , dust extinction in the @xmath1-band is lower than at shorter wavelengths ( a@xmath7 @xmath8 0.06 @xmath9 a@xmath10 ; rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) and is as low as at 513 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "second , the contribution from agn - powered dust emission to an observed flux , relative to stellar emission , increases substantially compared to @xmath11 2 @xmath0 m .",
    "therefore , the detection of buried agns becomes more feasible than at @xmath11 2 @xmath0 m .",
    "third , emission from a normal starburst and agn are clearly distinguishable based on @xmath1-band spectra @xcite . a strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature is usually found at 3.3 @xmath0 m in a normal starburst galaxy @xcite . in a pure normal starburst ,",
    "high equivalent - width 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission ( ew@xmath12 @xmath8 100 nm ; moorwood 1986 ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ) should always be found , since the equivalent width is , by definition , insensitive to dust extinction of the starburst . in a pure agn ,",
    "pah molecules are destroyed , rather than excited , by x - ray radiation of the agn @xcite , so that no 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission is expected @xcite . instead ,",
    "a featureless continuum from submicron - sized @xcite hot dust heated by an agn is found , making a pah - free smooth 34 @xmath0 m spectrum . in an agn / starburst composite galaxy ,",
    "3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission from the starburst should be found , unless the starburst regions are directly exposed to the x - ray radiation of the agn ; however , the pah emission is strongly diluted by the agn - originating pah - free continuum , so the ew@xmath12 value should be reduced compared to a pure normal starburst galaxy .",
    "thus , the presence of an obscured agn can be established using the ew@xmath12 value .",
    "if a highly dust - obscured agn is present , and yet the agn emission contributes significantly to the observed @xmath1-band flux , then absorption features at 3.1 and 3.4 @xmath0 m produced by ice - covered dust and bare carbonaceous dust , respectively , should be found @xcite .",
    "although a normal starburst , in which stellar energy sources and dust are spatially well mixed @xcite , can also show these absorption features @xcite , there is an upper limit for the absorption optical depths @xcite .",
    "this is because in this mixed source / dust geometry , the less - obscured , less - attenuated emission from the foreground ( which shows weak dust absorption features ) makes a stronger contribution to the observed flux than the emission from the distant side ( which shows strong dust absorption features but is highly attenuated ) .",
    "thus , strong dust absorption features whose optical depths are larger than the upper limit determined by the mixed source / dust geometry indicate that obscuring dust is present as a foreground screen distribution @xcite . a compact energy source that is more centrally concentrated than the surrounding dust , such as a buried agn , is a natural explanation @xcite , unless a large amount of dust in a nearly edge - on host galaxy is present in front of the primary 34 @xmath0 m continuum - emitting energy source .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath1-band spectra of a large number of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( l@xmath3 @xmath13 10@xmath14l@xmath6 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) in the well - studied _ iras _ 1 jy sample @xcite , searched for possible signatures of powerful buried agns in these galaxies , and statistically investigated the properties of buried agns .",
    "however , there also exist several ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( l@xmath3 @xmath13 10@xmath14l@xmath6 ) not included in the _ iras _ 1 jy sample , as well as galaxies with l@xmath3 @xmath15 10@xmath14l@xmath6 , that show possible signatures of agns obscured behind dust in data at other wavelengths . in this paper ,",
    "we present ground - based @xmath1-band spectra of such galaxies , with the aim of testing if this @xmath1-band spectroscopic method is indeed effective at finding agn signatures . throughout this paper , @xmath16 @xmath17 75 km s@xmath18",

    "( 1 ) they do not belong to ultraluminous infrared galaxies in the _ iras _ 1 jy sample and thus were not presented by @xcite .",

    "table 1 summarizes the observed targets .",
    "the sample selection is heterogeneous , but our @xmath1-band spectra can provide useful information about the nature of these interesting galaxies .      in normal starburst galaxies , the radio and far - infrared luminosities are correlated , with a relatively small scatter @xcite . if a galaxy shows a significant radio excess above this correlation , then the presence of a radio - intermediate ( or radio - loud ) agn is suggested .",
    "@xcite investigated the radio to far - infrared luminosity ratios of ultraluminous infrared galaxies and found that iras 04154 + 1755 shows ( 1 ) the largest radio excess and ( 2 ) a jet - like radio structure .",
    "this object is classified optically as a seyfert 2 @xcite , so that a powerful radio - intermediate agn must be present , hidden behind torus - shaped dust .",
    "no significant 210 kev x - ray emission from the putative agn was detected @xcite , which suggests that the agn suffers from compton - thick ( n@xmath21 @xmath13 10@xmath22 cm@xmath18 ) x - ray absorption .",

    "iso_. from these spectra , @xcite selected 18 sources that show strong ice absorption features at 6.0 @xmath0 m ( their table 1 , excluding ngc 253 and m82 ) . to detect ice absorption ,",
    "a significant quantity of dust grains covered with an ice mantle must be present in the foreground of the continuum - emitting source(s ) .",
    "such ice - covered dust grains are usually found deep inside molecular gas , where dust is sufficiently shielded from ambient uv radiation @xcite . a normal starburst galaxy with mixed source /",
    "dust geometry can produce ice absorption features , if a sufficient quantity of ice - covered dust is present .",
    "an obscured agn is an alternative candidate , particularly for sources with strong absorption and weak pah emission features ( see @xmath241 ) .    in the 511.5 @xmath0 m spectra ,",
    "pah emission features are found at 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "in addition to the h@xmath25o ice absorption at 6.0 @xmath0 m , there are also absorption features due to hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) at 6.85 and 7.3 @xmath0 m , and due to silicate dust at 9.7 @xmath0 m",
    ". since these emission and absorption features overlap significantly in wavelength , it is often difficult to distinguish whether these galaxies are absorption - dominated ( obscured agn candidates ) or pah - emission - dominated ( normal starbursts ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath1-band spectroscopy may help to distinguish whether the sources are dominated by pah emission or absorption features @xcite .    among the 18 strong ice absorption sources , eight ( iras 00188@xmath20856 , iras 05189@xmath22524 , ugc 5101 , ngc 4418 , mrk 231 , ngc 4945 , mrk 273 , arp 220 ) have available high quality @xmath1-band spectra @xcite .",

    "their optical seyfert 2 classifications indicate that ( 1 ) the agns are obscured along our line of sight by torus - shaped dust , ( 2 ) a large amount of the agns ionizing photons are escaping along the torus axis , and ( 3 ) emission lines , originating in the well - developed narrow line regions ( nlrs ) , are strong and clearly detectable in the optical spectra . for these optical seyfert 2s ,",
    "the presence of obscured agns is much more certain than in other infrared luminous galaxies with no optical seyfert signatures ( non - seyferts ) .",
    "hence , it is useful to test whether our @xmath1-band spectroscopic method can succeed in detecting agn signatures in these optical seyfert 2s .    for cygnus",
    "a and 3c 234 , the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah equivalent widths ( table 3 ) are more than an order of magnitude lower than those of typical starburst galaxies ( ew@xmath12 @xmath8100 nm ; moorwood 1986 ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ) . the observed @xmath1-band fluxes must be dominated by pah - free emission , most plausibly a featureless continuum from agn - heated hot dust .",
    "thus , our @xmath1-band spectroscopy has successfully revealed agn signatures in these two optical seyfert 2s .    for 3c 234 ,",
    "the [ mg viii]3.028@xmath0 m emission line is detected .",
    "the ionization potential of the [ mg viii ] line is as high as 224.9 ev , and this emission line has been detected in several nearby seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "the detection of such a high excitation forbidden emission line requires a very hard radiation field , further supporting the presence of an agn .",
    "the [ mg viii ] luminosity of 3c 234 is larger than the prototypical nearby seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 by a factor of 40 @xcite .",
    "the observed 210 kev x - ray luminosity from the agn in ngc 1068 is estimated to be @xmath81 @xmath9 10@xmath53 ergs s@xmath18 , but this is believed to be a reflected component @xcite . assuming a reflected fraction of 0.01 @xcite , the intrinsic 210 kev luminosity in ngc 1068 is lx(210 kev ) @xmath8 10@xmath54 ergs s@xmath18 .",
    "if the [ mg viii ] to 210 kev luminosity ratio in 3c 234 is similar to that of ngc 1068 , then the predicted 210 kev luminosity for 3c 234 is lx(210 kev ) @xmath8 4 @xmath9 10@xmath55 ergs s@xmath18 , which is roughly comparable to the measured value of @xmath81 @xmath9 10@xmath55 ergs s@xmath18 @xcite .    for iras 04154 + 1755 ,",
    "the presence of an agn is less certain than for cygnus a and 3c 234 , if we consider the ew@xmath12 value ( @xmath860 nm for iras 04154 + 1755 ; table 3 ) .",
    "however , the relatively large ew@xmath12 value in iras 04154 + 1755 is probably the consequence of the strong ( @xmath41 @xmath8 0.9 ) 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath25o ice absorption .",
    "this absorption feature strongly attenuates the agn - originated flux and reduces the dilution of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission by an agn continuum , making the ew@xmath12 value relatively large , even in the presence of a powerful obscured agn .",
    "we therefore search for signatures of an obscured agn based on a @xmath41 value .    as mentioned in @xmath241 , and in more detail in @xcite and @xcite , @xmath41 values can be used to distinguish between a normal starburst ( mixed source / dust geometry , small @xmath41 ) or an obscured agn ( centrally - concentrated energy source geometry , large @xmath41 ) . since the fraction of dust covered with an ice mantle in the majority of infrared luminous galaxies is likely to be smaller than the well - studied less infrared - luminous starburst galaxy m82 , because of harsher radiation environment in the former @xcite , @xmath41 larger than 0.3 suggests a centrally - concentrated energy source geometry @xcite .",
    "the large observed @xmath41 of iras 04154 + 1755 ( @xmath80.9 ) strongly indicates a centrally - concentrated energy source , such as an obscured agn .",
    "we note that iras 04154 + 1755 is located close to the galactic taurus molecular clouds , but no significant molecular gas is detected in the exact direction of iras 04154 + 1755 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the wavelength range in which h@xmath25o ice absorption is strong in figure 1 is similar to that expected from the profile of gl 2591 redshifted with @xmath40 0.056 , rather than @xmath40 0 .",
    "thus , the strong 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath25o absorption in iras 04154 + 1755 is believed to be nuclear in origin .    in summary ,",
    "our @xmath1-band spectroscopic method successfully provides agn evidence for the three optical seyfert 2s , which are known to possess luminous agns behind torus - shaped dust . @xcite",
    "also detected agn signatures in the @xmath1-band spectra of all observed ultraluminous infrared galaxies classified optically as seyferts .",
    "we can therefore conclude that our @xmath1-band spectroscopic method is at least as effective as conventional optical spectroscopy for the purpose of finding agns obscured behind dust .",
    "however , the question of how much more effective our @xmath1-band method is depends on the detection rate of buried agns in optical non - seyfert galaxies .      among the six observed optical non - seyfert galaxies ( ngc 828 , iras 15250 + 3609 , iras 17208@xmath20014 , ngc 1377 , ic 860 , and cgcg 1510.8 + 0725 ) , the ew@xmath12 values of ngc 828 and ngc 1377 are @xmath56 20 nm .",
    "starburst galaxies have an average value of ew@xmath12 @xmath8 100 nm , with some scatter , but never lower than @xmath840 nm @xcite .",
    "the small ew@xmath57 values of ngc 828 and ngc 1377 suggest that powerful agns are present , which heat up dust grains and produce strong pah - free featureless continua that dilute the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission from starbursts .",
    "our @xmath1-band spectroscopy thus newly reveals buried agn signatures in two optical non - seyfert galaxies .",
    "the @xmath1-band continuum of ngc 1377 is unusually red compared to normal starburst emission .",
    "such red @xmath1-band continua have previously been observed in the ultraluminous infrared galaxies superantennae @xcite and iras 08572 + 3915 @xcite , both of which show very weak 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission and are therefore classified as obscured - agn - dominated .",
    "very highly reddened hot dust emission heated by an obscured agn is the most natural explanation for the extremely red @xmath1-band continuum of ngc 1377 @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath43 value of 0.17 corresponds to a@xmath10 = 2540 mag , or a@xmath58",
    "= 1.42.5 mag if the galactic dust extinction curve is adopted .",
    "thus , the dereddened luminosity heated by an agn is @xmath59l@xmath60(3.8@xmath0 m ) = 0.41 @xmath9 10@xmath54 ergs s@xmath18 , which can account for a significant fraction of the infrared luminosity of ngc 1377 ( l@xmath3 @xmath8 3 @xmath9 10@xmath54 ergs s@xmath18 ) .",
    "for the two optical non - seyfert galaxies iras 17208@xmath20014 and cgcg 1510.8 + 0725 , some indications of buried agns might be present .    for iras 17208@xmath20014 , the large @xmath41 value of @xmath80.4 suggests a centrally - concentrated energy source , such as a buried agn , if the fraction of ice - covered dust is comparable to or smaller than that in the well - studied starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "however , @xcite found that the mid - infrared 12.5 @xmath0 m dust emission from iras 17208@xmath20014 is dominated by spatially extended components , with no prominent core , indicating that dust emission at this wavelength is dominated by extended starburst activity .",
    "the estimated surface brightness of iras 17208@xmath20014 is exceptionally low compared to other ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( l@xmath3 @xmath13 10@xmath14l@xmath6 ) , and can even be smaller than that of m82 @xcite .",
    "hence , the fraction of ice - covered dust can be larger than that in m82 , because of a weaker radiation density in iras 17208@xmath20014 . unlike the majority of other infrared luminous galaxies , the observed @xmath41 value of @xmath80.4 in iras 17208@xmath20014 could be reproduced by a mixed source / dust geometry ( @xmath245.2 ) .",
    "millimeter interferometric observations , based on the hcn ( j = 10 ) to hco@xmath61 ( j = 10 ) ratio in brightness temperature , have suggested that a buried agn might be present , but failed to reveal clear agn evidence @xcite . for this source , although absorption features at 511.5 @xmath0 m are found , 6.2 @xmath0 m pah emission is also strong @xcite .",
    "the presence of a luminous buried agn in iras 17208@xmath20014 has not been explicitly indicated in any available data and so is currently unclear .    for the weak [ cii ] emitter cgcg 1510.8 + 0725 , strong h@xmath25 emission might originate in a buried agn ( @xmath244.2 ) , but the buried agn evidence is not strong .",
    "although the presence of a strong buried agn is one possibility to explain the small [ cii ] to far - infrared continuum luminosity ratio @xcite , scenarios that do not invoke a powerful buried agn , such as large radiation density or optical depth effects in starbursts @xcite , could be alternative possibilities for the weak [ cii ] emission .",
    "it is unclear whether cgcg 1510.8 + 0725 does in fact possess a luminous buried agn .      for",
    "the remaining two optical non - seyfert galaxies ic 860 and iras 15250 + 3609 , no explicit buried agn signatures are evident in our spectra .",
    "for the weak [ cii ] emitter ic 860 , it is unclear whether there is indeed a powerful buried agn , as in the case of cgcg 1510.8 + 0725 ( @xmath245.4 ) .",
    "iras 15250 + 3609 shows strong absorption features , with very weak pah emission in its mid - infrared 511.5 @xmath0 m spectrum .",
    "these mid - infrared properties are very similar to ngc 1377 , and yet the @xmath1-band spectra are very different , in that only ngc 1377 shows strong buried agn signatures .",
    "this discrepancy probably derives from the different overall spectral energy distributions .",
    "figure 3 shows infrared 111.5 @xmath0 m spectral energy distributions of ngc 1377 and iras 15250 + 3609 . the emission at 511.5 @xmath0 m",
    "is dominated by dust emission powered by obscured energy sources ( starbursts and/or agns ) , whereas that at 12.5 @xmath0 m originates in foreground stellar emission .",
    "the signatures of obscured agns can only be detected in the @xmath1-band spectra if agn - heated hot dust emission contributes significantly to the observed @xmath1-band flux .    in figure 3 ( _ left _ ) , the @xmath1-band emission of ngc 1377 is smoothly connected to the longer wavelength dust emission spectrum observed with _ iso _ , which is judged to be powered by an obscured agn , because of strong absorption and lack of pah emission features @xcite .",
    "detection of strong agn signatures in the @xmath1-band spectrum of ngc 1377 is possible primarily because the agn - heated dust emission is a dominant component at @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1-band emission of iras 15250 + 3609 ( figure 3 , _ right _ ) corresponds to a transition between stellar and dust emission .",
    "the shorter part of the @xmath1-band spectrum ( @xmath153.5 @xmath0 m ) is likely to be dominated by foreground stellar emission , which is why we missed clear agn signatures in our @xmath1-band spectrum of iras 15250 + 3609 , despite its 511.5 @xmath0 m spectrum strongly suggesting the presence of a powerful obscured agn .",
    "we reported infrared @xmath1-band spectroscopic results for nine infrared luminous galaxies that may possess signatures of agns hidden behind dust based on observational data at other wavelengths . a radio to far - infrared excess galaxy ( iras 04154 + 1755 ) , four sources that exhibit absorption features in the 511.5 @xmath0 m spectra ( ngc 828 , iras 15250 + 3609 , iras 17208@xmath20014 , and ngc 1377 ) , two weak [ cii ] 158@xmath0 m emitters ( ic 860 and cgcg 1510.8 + 0725 ) , and two narrow - line radio galaxies ( cygnus a and 3c 234 ) were observed . using the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature , the [ mg viii ] 3.028 @xmath0 m emission line , and absorption features at 3.1 @xmath0 m from ice - covered dust and at 3.4 @xmath0 m from bare carbonaceous dust , we searched for signatures of obscured agns in our @xmath1-band spectra .",
    "for the two weak [ cii ] emitters , @xmath31-band spectra were also simultaneously taken .",
    "we found the following main results :    1 .",
    "for two optical seyfert 2 galaxies ( cygnus a and 3c 234 ) , our results strongly suggested that the observed @xmath1-band spectra are dominated by a pah - free featureless continuum , originating in agn - heated hot dust , because of very small 3.3 @xmath0 m pah equivalent widths . a strong detection of the [ mg viii ] 3.028 @xmath0 m line in the @xmath1-band spectrum of 3c 234 also supported the presence of a luminous agn behind torus - shaped dust in this source .",
    "2 .   for another optical seyfert 2 galaxy , iras 04154 + 1755 ,",

    "<S> we present the results of infrared 2.84.1 @xmath0 m ( @xmath1-band ) spectroscopy of nearby infrared luminous galaxies with possible signatures of dust - obscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in data at other wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the samples are chosen to include sources with a radio excess relative to far - infrared emission , strong absorption features in mid - infrared 511.5 @xmath0 m spectra , unusually weak [ cii ] 158 @xmath0 m emission relative to the far - infrared continuum , and radio galaxies classified optically as narrow - line objects . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to investigate whether the signatures of possible obscured agns can be detected in our @xmath1-band spectra , based on the strengths of emission and absorption features . </S>",
    "<S> six of nine observed sources clearly show 3.3 @xmath0 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features , a good starburst indicator . an absorption feature at 3.1 @xmath0 m due to ice - covered dust </S>",
    "<S> is detected in iras 04154 + 1755 and iras 17208@xmath20014 . </S>",
    "<S> the signature of a bare carbonaceous dust absorption feature at 3.4 @xmath0 m is seen in ngc 1377 . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath1-band spectra reveal strong signatures of obscured agns in all three optical seyfert 2 galaxies ( iras 04154 + 1755 , cygnus a , and 3c 234 ) , and two galaxies classified optically as non - seyferts ( ngc 828 and ngc 1377 ) . among the remaining optical non - seyferts , iras 17208@xmath20014 </S>",
