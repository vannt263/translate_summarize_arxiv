    "recently there is strong interest in the impact of spin - orbit coupling on the electronic structure of solids and surfaces as this gives rise to many interesting and technically important phenomena . in this context",
    "one may mention the well known magneto - crystalline anisotropy but also the interesting galvano - magnetic and spin transport phenomena.@xcite other examples for the central role of spin - orbit coupling can be found in the field of spectroscopy as the magneto - optical effects and the various magneto - dichroic phenomena in x - ray spectroscopy.@xcite finally one may mention the rashba splitting@xcite of surface states of transition metals as well as occurrence of the topological surface states in topological insulators.@xcite    computational schemes used to describe these phenomena or materials , respectively , have to account at the same time for spin - orbit coupling , spin polarization or magnetic ordering as well as the structural properties of the investigated system in a coherent and reliable way . among the various available schemes",
    "the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) or multiple scattering method is especially attractive as it gives direct access to the green function ( gf ) .",
    "making use of the dyson equation allows for example by means of the corresponding embedding technique to deal with rather complex systems.@xcite another important field of application for the kkr - gf method is the investigation of disordered systems usually done in combination with the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite alloy theory .",
    "the spin - polarized relativistic ( spr ) version of the kkr method set up on the basis of the four - component dirac formalism that allows to account for all relativistic effects and spin magnetism within the framework of l(s)da ( local ( spin ) density approximation ) on equal footing was worked out by various authors.@xcite extensions to this approach were made to deal with orbital polarization @xcite as well as the presence of a vector potential coupling to the total current of the electrons.@xcite corresponding implementations and applications of the kkr method were done in general making use of the asa ( atomic sphere approximation ) that implies spherical symmetry for the potential functions and rotational symmetry for the corresponding vector fields coupling to the spin and current of the electrons .",
    "finally , the so - called full potential ( fp ) version of the spr - kkr method that removes the mentioned geometrical restrictions was discussed and implemented by various authors.@xcite    compared to the non - relativistic version of the kkr method its fully relativistic formulation leads to a number of technical complications .",
    "the need to distinguish between right ( rhs ) and left hand side ( lhs ) solutions to the dirac equation was discussed in particular by tamura @xcite for the case of a general local potential . here",
    "we extend this work discussing among others the impact of a non - local site - diagonal potential and several practical aspects of corresponding kkr calculations .",
    "starting point of our considerations is an effective one - electron hamiltonian @xmath0 that can be split into an energy - independent , hermitian part @xmath1 and an energy - dependent , non - hermitian part : @xmath2 with the hermitian adjoined operator @xmath3 here @xmath4 stands for the hamiltonian of the free - electron system , @xmath5 for an energy independent hermitian potential and the non - hermitian self - energy @xmath6 may depend on the energy @xmath7 .",

    "finally , it should be mentioned that in the context of the relativistic l(s)da+u @xcite as well as l(s)da+dmft @xcite eq .   or , resp .",
    ", has been dealt with so far in an approximate way . because for both schemes the coupling of the self - energy is usually restricted to the d- or f - electrons and",
    "because the basis functions for the self - energy ( see eq .  ) have the same @xmath105-character , it seems justified to interchange the role of the radial functions to be calculated and of the basis functions .",
    "this transfers the radial integro - differential equations into differential equations as they occur in the case of full potential type calculations @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the set up of the corresponding green function simplifies in a dramatic way as can be seen from the discussions in section [ sec : single - site - green - function ] .      as the rhs and lhs solutions derive from the same hamiltonian , it is obvious that they are not independent from each other .",
    "in fact , the vector space spanned by the lhs solutions is dual to that spanned by the rhs solutions .",
    "in particular , tamura@xcite could show that the rhs and lhs solutions are connected via @xmath106 by making use of the behavior of the hamiltonian @xmath107 under time reversal @xmath108 .",
    "this implies for the radial functions the relations@xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 stands for the sign of the quantum number @xmath81@xcite and the vector @xmath111 represents also the dependence of the wave functions on the vector potential @xmath112 as well as the spin dependent part of the self - energy @xmath113 that also reverse sign under time reversal .",

    "accordingly both sets of equations will be solved by the same set of linearly independent ( unnormalized ) radial functions , i.e.  these have to be determined only once .",
    "to see under which conditions this favorable situation holds , we restrict for the moment to the case @xmath122 and expand the real potentials @xmath23 , @xmath123 , and @xmath26 in terms of real spherical harmonics @xmath124 according to : @xmath125 one has for their matrix elements : @xmath126 with real functions @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 and @xmath130 indicating the components of the vector fields with @xmath131 the corresponding unit vector .",

    "the conditions for this to happen are discussed in some detail in section [ subsec : coupling - scheme ] .",
