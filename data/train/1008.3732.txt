    "brown dwarfs are defined as the objects that were born as isolated objects but were not massive enough to ignite hydrogen nuclear burning @xcite .",
    "they are particularly of interest for their extremely low - temperature atmospheres in relation to giant planets .",
    "observational studies of brown dwarfs have been extensively carried out since the first definitive identification of a genuine brown dwarf gl  229b ( of the class now known as t - dwarf ) by @xcite .",
    "the first l - type brown dwarf gd 165b was reported by @xcite although it was debated for some time whether it was a star or a brown dwarf .",
    "this very red object is important in that the presence of dust layer in the photosphere was recognized for the first time by this object @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations in the infrared regime are the most essential tools to obtain physical and chemical information of brown dwarfs , through absorption bands of various molecules in the atmospheres .",
    "carbon monoxide ( co ) plays a decisive role in determining the major characteristics of cool stars because of its very large dissociation energy @xcite . in brown dwarfs , the co first overtone band at 2.3 @xmath0 m",
    "is observed until early - t type sources ( see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the role of co , however , changes in very cool dwarfs : carbon resides mostly in ch@xmath4 rather than in co in a very cool ( e.g. @xmath5k ) and high density ( e.g. @xmath6 ) environment @xcite , and co no longer plays any critical role under such a circumstance .",
    "although no celestial object outside our solar system having such a physical condition had been known , it was found at last that such a case is actually realized in the brown dwarf gl  229b showing strong ch@xmath4 bands @xcite .    however , nature is not so simple as predicted by a simple theory of thermochemistry .",
    "in fact , it was not long before an unexpected detection of co fundamental band at 4.6  @xmath0 m in gl  229b , classified as t6 , was reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these pioneering observations highlighted roles of non - equilibrium chemical processes .",
    "the idea of vertical mixing was suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because of the extreme stability of co , the chemical time scale is much longer than the mixing timescale and co is dredged up by vertical mixing from the inner part of the atmosphere where co is still abundant to the surface layers where ch@xmath4 dominates instead of co. recently two more late - t dwarfs were found to show the co band by @xcite , confirming that the presence of co is a general characteristic of late - t dwarfs .",
    "it is to be remembered that the observations so far are limited to late - t dwarfs .",
    "observations of the co fundamental band in early - t and l - type dwarfs are needed for a unified understanding of the physical and chemical processes related to co in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the ch@xmath4 and of the co transitions in @xmath7 and @xmath8-band are always difficult from the ground .",
    "severe atmospheric absorption and limited wavelength coverage make precise analysis difficult .",
    "thus , there is a strong motivation to carry out near - infrared spectroscopy of brown dwarfs from space , especially in the region of 2.55.0  @xmath0 m which remains the least explored so far .    the infrared astronomical satellite _ akari _",
    "@xcite was launched in 2006 february .",
    "scientific observations under cryogenic condition were carried out from 2006 may to 2007 august , and ended with the liquid helium boil - off .",
    "the satellite is equipped with a 68.5 cm cooled telescope and two scientific instruments covering the wavelength range of 1.8180  @xmath0 m .",
    "one of them , the infrared camera ( irc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) carried out imaging and spectroscopic observations in the near- to mid - infrared wavelength regions .",
    "the irc provided a unique opportunity to take spectra of brown dwarfs in the range between 2.5 and 5.0  @xmath0 m without interference of telluric absorption from the atmosphere . in the framework of the _",
    "akari _ mission programme ( mp ; coordinated observations by the project team members ) , we have carried out a series of near - infrared spectroscopic observations of ultracool dwarfs .",
    "this programme , _ nirlt _ ( pi : i.yamamura ) , aims to obtain a set of legacy data for studies of the evolution of physical and chemical structure of l- and t - dwarfs . in this paper",
    "we present the initial results from this programme .    as a basis of interpretation of the spectra observed with _",
    "akari _ , we determine basic physical parameters of six well observed objects . for this purpose",
    ", we apply model photospheres as in the analyses of ordinary stars . however , the model photospheres of ultracool dwarfs including brown dwarfs are by no means well established yet .",
    "it has been discussed that dust grains in the atmosphere play an important role in the formation of spectra of ultracool dwarfs : especially spectra of l - type dwarfs ( @xmath9 22001400 k ) are strongly influenced by the continuous opacity of dust , while spectra of even cooler t - type dwarfs are dominated by deep molecular absorption bands @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have no definite guideline for treating dust formation in the photosphere . some attempts to model the photospheres of brown dwarfs with dust clouds",
    "have been carried out by several groups and these are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "it was shown that all models agree on the global structure of the dusty photospheres , but predicted features such as the emergent spectra differ considerably , depending on the opacity data and reflecting the extreme complexity of such objects .",
    "we apply the unified cloudy model ( ucm : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as an example of such dusty model photospheres to the analysis of our objects .",
    "we assume solar metallicity throughout , and estimate @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( critical temperature that defines the upper boundary of the dust cloud ; see section  [ sec : predspec ] for detail ) , and @xmath12 from the relative seds ( i.e. shapes of the spectra ) .",
    "we then fit the observed and predicted spectra on an absolute scale and estimate the radii of individual objects with the use of the known parallaxes . based on the final fits of the model spectra to the observed ones , we try to interpret the new features in the spectral region between 2.5 and 5.0  @xmath0 m observed with _",
    "akari _ for the first time .",
    "the _ akari_/irc covered its wavelength range with three independent cameras operated simultaneously , namely the nir ( near - infrared ) , mir - s ( mid - infrared short ) , and mir - l ( mid - infrared long ) channels .",
    "our observations were all carried out in the aot ( astronomical observation template ) irc04 with parameters of `` b;np '' @xcite . in this mode a grism was used to achieve the highest available spectral resolution ; the dispersion was 0.0097  @xmath0m / pixel or @xmath13 at 3.6  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "targets were placed in the @xmath14 point source aperture mask to minimize the contamination from nearby stars and background sky .",
    "the aperture mask was only available for the nir channel , and the spectra obtained in this programme were limited to the near - infrared wavelength range of 2.55.0  @xmath0 m .",
    "our target list consisted of 30 brown dwarfs selected by their expected fluxes ( to be bright enough for the _ akari_/irc instrument to provide high - quality spectra within reasonable number of pointings ) and their spectral types ( to sample various types from l to t ) . a pointed observation by _",
    "akari _ allowed about 10 minutes of exposure .",
    "at least two observations were requested per target to obtain data redundancy .",
    "due to severe visibility constraint of the satellite , not all requested observations were carried out .",
    "there were 18 pointing opportunities for 11 objects in the cryogenic mission phase .",
    "a summary of the observed targets is given in table  [ tbl : target ] , and the observation record is presented in table  [ tbl : obslog ] .",
    "the tables include observations which were not successful , for completeness .",

    "when an object was observed twice , the two data sets were processed independently and are plotted in different colors . in general , the two spectra are consistent with each other , demonstrating the high quality and reliability of the data .",
    "the overall seds of the observed spectra agree well with the predictions from the previous photometry and theoretical works .",
    "the spectra of l - type dwarfs are rather smooth and featureless , mildly peaked at 3.8  @xmath0 m as a result of broad absorption bands of h@xmath2o at shorter wavelengths and co at longer wavelengths . on the other hand , spectra of t - type dwarfs",
    "are dominated by deep molecular absorption features . as expected , we detect ch@xmath4 and h@xmath2o molecular bands .",
    "the bands deepen as the spectral type evolves .",
    "the band shapes are heavily distorted due to saturation in the latest object , 2mass j041519@xmath10935 ( t8 ) .",
    "the most remarkable finding in the current _ akari _ spectra is a detection of the co@xmath2 fundamental stretching - mode band at 4.2  @xmath0 m in the late - l and t - type dwarfs .",

    "this is the first detection of co@xmath2 in brown dwarfs , since the wavelength is inaccessible from the ground or even from airborne observations due to huge opacity of the molecule itself in the telluric atmosphere .",
    "the band is most apparent in the t4.5 dwarf 2mass j055919@xmath11404 , and is clearly recognized in 2mass j041519@xmath10935 ( t8 ) and @xmath19 ind ba+bb ( t1+t6 ) .",

    "another important result from our observations is that we see the co fundamental band in the 4.45.0  @xmath0 m region in all of our samples including the coolest t8 dwarf , 2mass j041519@xmath10935 .",

    "@xcite selected this object as a high-@xmath22 quasar candidate from the sdss commissioning image and found it to be an l5 dwarf through follow - up spectroscopy . due to its relatively high flux level",

    "this l5 object was nominated as a brown dwarf by @xcite .",
    "because of relatively low s / n compared to another l5 object sdss j053951@xmath10059 above , we do not recognize the ch@xmath4 @xmath17-branch dip in the spectrum of this source , while the overall seds are consistent with each other .",

    "we observed the object twice within a day but found that one observation ( obsid=1720003 - 1 ) was significantly degraded by charged particle hits before and during the exposure . the other spectrum ( obsid=1720004 - 1 ) shown in figure",
    "[ fig : ircspec ] clearly exhibits the four major molecular bands ; ch@xmath4 , h@xmath2o , co and co@xmath2 .",

    "@xcite classified the object as t4.5 .",
    "the _ akari _",

    "the spectra show a peak at 4  @xmath0 m .",
    "a sharp peak , probably the co band center appears very clearly between the @xmath21- and @xmath20-branches .",
    "our observations are consistent with the photometry by @xcite that the @xmath25 band flux of this source is fainter by a factor of three than that expected if co / ch@xmath4 abundance follows thermal equilibrium .",
    "our spectra confirm that co is the major source of opacity in the wavelength region .",
    "this object was first identified as a t - type brown dwarf by @xcite based on near infrared spectroscopy .",
    "the object has been designated a `` standard '' t8 source by @xcite .",
    "it is one of the latest spectral - type brown dwarf , and is the coolest object in our sample .",
    "the first observations of this target with _",
    "akari _ were carried out in 2007 february .",
    "however , the data were considerably contaminated by ghosting from a nearby bright star .",
    "we reobserved the object a half year later in 2007 august and obtained a clean spectrum .",
    "the spectra exhibit deep h@xmath2o and ch@xmath4 absorption bands , which are almost completely saturated at the wavelengths below 3.5  @xmath0 m . on the other hand ,",
    "the object has sufficient flux in the longer wavelength range , where we clearly identify the co and co@xmath2 bands .",
    "two independent observations show almost identical shape in this wavelength range , strengthening the reality of the detections .",
    "in this section , we examine to what extent the newly observed spectra of the 2.55.0  @xmath0 m region can be explained with the model spectra and what remains unexplained with the present models of the photospheres of cool dwarfs . for this purpose",
    ", we apply our unified cloudy model ( ucm ) , a brief description of which is given in section  [ sec : predspec ] .",
    "we assume local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) throughout this section .",
    "then we outline our method of analysis with some examples in section  [ sec : obsvsucm ] and the results of our analysis in section  [ sec : ucmfitresults ] .",
    "the physical parameters estimated by our analysis are summarized in section  [ sec : params ] .",
    "finally , we examine the errors and limitation of our analysis based on the ucm in section  [ sec : errors ] .",
    "generally , stellar spectra can be interpreted in terms of @xmath10 , @xmath12 , chemical composition , and micro - turbulent velocity . however , a new feature in the spectra of brown dwarfs , compared with usual stellar spectra , is the effect of dust clouds formed in the photosphere . if the properties of dust clouds can be defined uniquely from the four basic parameters considered above , the spectra of brown dwarfs could eventually be interpreted in terms of these four parameters , namely @xmath10 , @xmath12 , chemical composition , and micro - turbulent velocity . at present , the dependence of the dust cloud properties on the four basic parameters is unknown , because the formation and disappearance of dust clouds in the photospheres of brown dwarfs is not yet well understood .    on the other hand , some observations indicate that the properties of the dust clouds do not necessarily depend uniquely on such basic parameter as @xmath10 .",
    "for example , infrared colors such as @xmath26 plotted against @xmath10 show a large variation at a fixed @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since these infrared colors depend directly on the properties of the dust clouds , this fact implies that the properties of the dust clouds should be different even for the same @xmath10 .",
    "also , one important observational result is that @xmath10 shows little change over the spectral types between about l5 and t5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , the characteristics of the spectra used as signatures of the spectral types are quite different even for the same @xmath10 and hence they are not necessarily be determined by @xmath10 .",
    "this result implies that the basic features of the spectra of brown dwarfs should be determined by some additional parameter(s ) other than @xmath10 . again",
    "dust should play a major role in this respect as in the case of the infrared colors noted above .",
    "thus , a major problem is how to consider the effect of dust in the interpretation and analysis of the spectra of brown dwarfs . for this purpose",
    ", we apply our unified cloudy model ( ucm ) in which the dust forms at a layer where temperature is equal to the condensation temperature , @xmath27 , but disappears at somewhat lower temperature which we refer to as the critical temperature , @xmath11 . at this temperature",
    ", the radius of the dust grain @xmath28 reaches the critical radius @xmath29 , where the gibbs energy of condensation is maximum .",
    "then , at this point , dust starts to grow larger and larger , and will precipitate from the gaseous mixture .",
    "for this reason , dust disappears in the layers with @xmath30 , and will exist only in the layers of @xmath31 .",
    "thus dust is present in the layers whose photospheric temperatures are within the above range , and this means that a thin dust cloud forms in the photosphere of brown dwarfs , as discussed in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath27 is defined by the thermodynamical data and is hence fully controlled by @xmath10 and @xmath12 ( see e.g. figure  3 in @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath11 is not predictable by any physical theory at present .",
    "instead , @xmath11 is introduced as a free parameter in our ucm , and it serves as a measure of the thickness of the dust cloud ( the dust cloud is thicker if the deviation of @xmath11 from @xmath27 is larger ) .    with the introduction of @xmath11 ,",
    "the ucm is characterized by the five parameters including @xmath11 in addition to the usual four parameters , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , chemical composition , and micro - turbulent velocity . from observations",
    ", we showed that at least one additional parameter is needed to describe the observed characteristics of brown dwarfs , and we now propose to identify @xmath11 as the additional parameter required from observations .",
    "a new feature in the _ akari _ observations discussed in section  [ sec : nirspec ] is the detection of the co@xmath32 band at 4.2  @xmath0 m . although co@xmath32 is included in the construction of the ucm as well as in our evaluation of the spectra with the use of the band model opacity ( e.g. appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we recompute the spectra with the co@xmath32 line list from the hitemp database @xcite in view of the detection of the co@xmath32 band in several objects . as an example , a predicted spectrum including co@xmath32 based on the line list ( solid line )",
    "is compared with that without co@xmath32 ( dashed line ) in figure  [ fig : ucmco2 ] for a ucm with @xmath33 1300 k , @xmath34 1800 k , @xmath35 , @xmath36 1 kms@xmath37 , and solar abundance . for comparison ,",
    "the result based on the band model opacity is shown by the dotted line .",
    "we use the band model opacity during the iterations of model construction but apply the line list in all the computation of the spectra .",
    "so far , co@xmath32 was largely neglected in spectroscopy and model photospheres of cool dwarfs , but the result shown in figure  [ fig : ucmco2 ] reveals that the effect of co@xmath32 absorption is significant even within the framework of the lte analysis . since",
    "carbon atoms are mostly consumed in co and/or ch@xmath38 in cool dwarfs , co@xmath32 can not be very abundant , but rather large @xmath39-values of co@xmath32 transitions make the molecule an important absorber in the spectra of cool dwarfs .",
    "the major spectral feature in the 2.55.0  @xmath0 m region is the ch@xmath38 fundamental band at 3.3  @xmath0 m , for which we apply the line list by freedman ( 2005 , private communication ) discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "certainly the ch@xmath38 line lists including the high excitation lines are not yet satisfactory as discussed before @xcite , but we believe that freedman s list is the best one currently available for the fundamental band .",
    "other line lists included are : h@xmath2o @xcite , co @xcite , oh @xcite , cn @xcite , and sio @xcite . also , nh@xmath40 , ph@xmath40 , and",
    "h@xmath32s are considered on the basis of the band models . with these spectroscopic data ,",
    "the spectra between 2.5 and 5.0  @xmath0 m for our ucms are evaluated at a resolution of 0.01 cm@xmath37 and convolved with the slit function of fwhm = 3000kms@xmath37 , which is about the resolving power of the _ akari _ spectrometer .",
    "note that the observed spectra shown in figures  [ fig : fit0830 ] ,  [ fig : fit0559 ] ,  &  [ fig : fitall ] are smoothed with @xmath42 , and that the error weighted average is taken if two valid spectra are available .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the spectral region between 2.5 and 5.0  @xmath0 m , which we have observed completely for the first time .",
    "although analyses of different spectral regions do not necessarily provide the same answer as to what are the best parameters of the photosphere , as shown in detail by @xcite , we restrict our analysis to the 2.55.0  @xmath0 m region for this very reason . in fact , for our purpose stated at the beginning of this section , it is meaningless to find a solution that provides a good fit to other regions but not to the 2.55.0  @xmath0 m region .",
    "we return to this problem in section  [ sec : errors ] .",
    "we assume that the objects we have observed are all of solar metallicity @xcite and that the micro - turbulent velocity is near solar ( 1  kms@xmath37 ) throughout",
    ". then , major parameters that define the characteristics of a spectrum are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . in fitting the observed spectrum with the predicted one",
    ", we refer to the empirical data summarized in table  [ tbl : knowndata ] .",

    "this fact suggests that the so - called empirical @xmath10 can not be fully realistic as will be discussed in section  [ sec : teffr ] .",
    "we also consider three cases of @xmath34 1700 , 1800 , & 1900k and three values of @xmath45 4.5 , 5.0 , 5.5 .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath46 combinations of these parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) , and select the case that shows a best fit to the overall shape of the 2.55.0  @xmath0 m sed .",

    "the empirical @xmath10 of this l9 dwarf is 1327k ( table  [ tbl : knowndata ] ) , but the ch@xmath38 3.3  @xmath0 m band is too weak for such a low value of @xmath10 .",

    "the effect of @xmath12 is rather modest as shown in figure  [ fig : fit0830]c , but the lowest gravity of @xmath35 provides better fits both to the ch@xmath38 3.3  @xmath0 m and co@xmath32 4.2  @xmath0 m bands than the higher values .",

    "in fact , the overall shape of the sed as well as the strengths of the ch@xmath38 @xmath17-branch at 3.3  @xmath0 m and the co fundamental at 4.6  @xmath0 m is reasonably fit for this case as shown in figure  [ fig : fitall]a .",

    "the resulting fit in absolute scale in figure  [ fig : fitall]b shows that the observed spectrum of the 2.55.0  @xmath0 m region , which possesses almost no distinct features , can reasonably be accounted for by our model .",
    "the empirical @xmath10 of this l8 dwarf is 1330k ( table  [ tbl : knowndata ] ) , but we found that the best fit is found for ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) = ( 1500 , 1700 , 4.5 ) . in fact , the modest strength of the ch@xmath38 3.3  @xmath0 m band suggests that @xmath10 can not be below 1300 k , and it is only the case of @xmath97 1500k that provides a reasonable fit not only to the @xmath17- but also to the @xmath20- and @xmath21-branches of the ch@xmath38 fundamental band .",
    "we confirm that such a fit as shown for @xmath34 1700k can no longer be found for @xmath11 as high as 18001900 k. this result is consistent with the red @xmath26 color of 1.60 ( table  [ tbl : knowndata ] ) , which implies that the dust cloud of this l8 dwarf is rather thick .",
    "the strength of the co fundamental band is almost independent of @xmath12 , but the @xmath20- and @xmath21-branches of the ch@xmath38 fundamentals depend on @xmath12 and can only be explained with the low gravity of @xmath35 .",
    "the effect of @xmath12 on the infrared spectrum is again rather modest and accurate determination of @xmath12 is difficult .",
    "a detection of co@xmath32 at 4.2  @xmath0 m suggested in section  [ sec : nirspec ] can be well supported by our model prediction that shows a depression at the expected position of the co@xmath32 4.2  @xmath0 m band and even shows a reasonable fit quantitatively ( see figure  [ fig : fitall]c ) .",
    "the fit in the region of the co fundamental band appears to be poor and the deep absorption features near 4.5 and 4.9  @xmath0 m remain unexplained .",
    "we suspect , however , that the co fundamental band provides the major contribution as in later type dwarfs to be discussed in section  [ sec : fit0830 ] .",
    "thus the spectrum observed by _",
    "akari _ now shows some dissonances with the predicted spectrum in this late - l dwarf as shown in figure  [ fig : fitall]c .      as already discussed in some detail in section  [ sec : obsvsucm ] , we find ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) = ( 1500 , 1700 , 4.5 ) for this object . the final fit is shown in figure  [ fig : fitall]d .",
    "we notice that the resulting parameters are the same as that for 2mass j152322@xmath33014 discussed in section  [ sec : fit1523 ] .",
    "this result is also consistent with the similarity of the empirical @xmath10 and of the @xmath26 color between these two late - l dwarfs ( see table  [ tbl : knowndata ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the observed spectra of the two objects differ significantly .",
    "for example , the observed feature near the 2.72.9  @xmath0 m region ( largely due to h@xmath2o @xmath98 and 2@xmath99 bands ) shows a large difference between these two objects of the same physical parameters . since this feature is well reproduced by our models in other objects except for sdss j083008@xmath34828 ( see figure  [ fig : fitall ] ) , this should not be due to any systematic effects in our models .",
    "a more interesting result is that the observed co@xmath32 4.2  @xmath0 m feature in this object is very strong as noted already ( section  [ sec : nirspec ] ) , and that it is too strong compared with the prediction in marked contrast to the case of 2mass j152322@xmath33014 .",
    "it appears that the co@xmath32 4.2  @xmath0 m feature can not be explained by any combination of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 with our ucm essentially based on the lte assumption , while those of 2mass j152322@xmath33014 may be more consistent with the lte prediction .",
    "such a large difference in co@xmath32 band in the two objects of similar physical parameters can not be explained by differences in dust cloud properties if , as we find , @xmath11 is nearly the same around 1700k in both objects . the deep absorption at 4.5  @xmath0 m can be identified with the @xmath21-branch of the co fundamental , but can not be explained within the framework of the lte assumption as well .",
    "thus , there are serious difficulties in understanding the spectrum observed by _",
    "akari _ in that the region between 4 and 5  @xmath0 m can not be fitted at all by the lte prediction based on our ucm .",
    "details of the model fitting of this object were described in section  [ sec : obsvsucm ] , and our final fit on an absolute scale is shown in figure  [ fig : fitall]e . we are shocked to see that the discrepancy between the observed and predicted spectra is so large in the region beyond 4.1  @xmath0 m .",
    "the region of co @xmath21-branch is too deep to be explained by our lte model and co @xmath20-branch also appears to be appreciable .",
    "thus we confirm that the co bands are actually enhanced not only in late - t dwarfs but also in mid - t dwarfs , as anticipated by photometric observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this object",
    ", a more important result is that the new spectrum observed by _",
    "akari _ provides definite evidence for the presence of the strong co@xmath2 band in brown dwarfs for the first time .",
    "the depression at 4.2  @xmath0 m is too large to be accounted for by the predicted co@xmath2 band and the discrepancy between the observed and predicted spectra is quite serious .",
    "all these new features due to co and co@xmath2 can not be accounted for by the present lte model such as our ucm . in contract to these serious disagreements in the region beyond 4  @xmath0 m , the observed and predicted spectra agree quite well in the region between 2.5 and 4.1  @xmath0 m .",
    "recent analysis of the sed of this object by @xcite concluded that @xmath33 1200k , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the cloud sedimentation efficiency parameter and a larger value implies greater sedimentation efficiency resulting in a thinner cloud @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath102 is a parameter that may have a similar role as our @xmath11 , with larger @xmath102 corresponding to higher @xmath11 .",
    "thus their result showing relatively large value of @xmath103 4 is consistent with our relatively high value of @xmath34 1900k , and we agree with them on the properties of the dust cloud in this t4.5 dwarf .",
    "we also agree that @xmath10 = 1200k for this object .",
    "thus our results for the cloud properties as well as for @xmath10 show good agreements with those by @xcite , despite the fact that different spectral regions are analyzed with different models .",
    "unfortunately , the results for gravity differ considerably .",
    "however , seds are not very sensitive to the gravity and this is the parameter most difficult to determine from the model fittings ( as will further be discussed in section  [ sec : gravity ] ) .    in summary",
    ", some dissonances between the observed and predicted spectra , seen in the late - l dwarfs , appear to be quite distinct in this mid - t dwarf .",
    "the empirical @xmath10 of this t8 dwarf is 764k ( table  [ tbl : knowndata ] ) and , if a dust cloud forms , it is situated below the layer of the optical depth unity in such a very cool dwarf .",
    "for this reason , the spectrum no longer depends on @xmath11 , as we have actually confirmed .",
    "accordingly , we apply the dust - free models in which dust grains have all precipitated just after they are formed ( this means @xmath11 = @xmath27 ) , and we find the best possible fit for ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) = ( 800 , @xmath27 , 4.5 ) .    determination of the physical properties of the coolest brown dwarfs including 2mass j041519@xmath10935 has been discussed by @xcite , who calibrated the strengths of h@xmath32o bands and relative fluxes in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath12 . as a result , they suggested @xmath97740760k and @xmath1044.95.0 for this object . also , @xcite suggested a similar result of @xmath97725775k and @xmath1045.005.37 based on the analysis of a spectrum including new data obtained with _ spitzer space telescope_. our result is reasonably consistent with these results , although the values of @xmath12 differ from each other",
    ". thus analyses of the different spectral regions by the different models show more or less consistent results in this object at least for @xmath10 .",
    "the overall fit of the predicted spectrum of the possible best model is not so bad ( see figure  [ fig : fitall]f ) , but we confirm that the region of the co bands can not be fitted at all .",
    "such a possible large discrepancy in the predicted and observed co bands in late - t dwarfs was previously suggested based on the ground based observation of gl  229b @xcite , and more recently for two other late - t dwarfs by @xcite .",
    "we confirm these previous results and add a new case of largely enhanced co fundamentals in late - t dwarfs .",
    "we also note that the @xmath21-branch is much stronger compared with the @xmath20-branch .",
    "a more interesting result is that the co@xmath32 band at 4.2  @xmath0 m appears quite distinctly in this late - t dwarf too .",
    "it is impossible to explain both the co and also the co@xmath32 bands by the lte models , and we will discuss such cases in the section  [ sec : nonlte ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "the new spectral region explored by _ akari _ for the first time reveals : first , the enhancement of the co fundamental bands is a general feature and , second , the co@xmath32 band at 4.2  @xmath0 m appear to be an important absorber , in late - l and t dwarfs .",
    "we now discuss briefly the resulting @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath105 values summarized in table  [ tbl : fit ] .",
    "also , we discuss briefly the effects of other basic parameters , namely chemical composition ( in section  [ sec : cc ] ) and micro - turbulent velocity ( in section  [ sec : vmic ] ) , which we assumed to be the solar . if we try to determine these two parameters by the same way as we have done in section  [ sec : obsvsucm ] and [ sec : ucmfitresults ] for the three basic parameters , we must consider at least @xmath106 models instead of 27 models for each object , but this is clearly impractical .",
    "moreover , we do not think that the chemical abundances and micro - turbulent velocity can be determined from such low resolution spectra as those we have at hand .",
    "we notice first that our @xmath10 s do not agree with the so - called empirical effective temperatures obtained from the observed luminosities and a constant radius such as @xmath107@xcite ( see 7-th column of table  [ tbl : fit ] ) .",
    "in fact , we already notice through section  [ sec : fit0539 ] and [ sec : fit0415 ] that the observed seds can not be fitted well with the predicted ones assuming the empirical @xmath10 by @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the empirical @xmath10 largely depends on the accuracy of the values of the radius .",
    "the constant radius of @xmath107 was based on a statistical analysis by @xcite of the evolutionary models of cool dwarfs by @xcite , but it is unknown if it is appropriate to apply such a value to all the objects .",
    "it is known that the radii of cool substellar objects are independent of mass to within 30 per cent for a broad range of masses from 0.3 to 70@xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the resulting radii of all our six objects ( table  [ tbl : fit ] ) appear to be consistent with the prediction of the evolutionary models and confirm that the radii of ultracool dwarfs are within approximately 30 per cent of jupiter s radius .",
    "the mean radius for our six objects is 0.81@xmath109 , and thus we agree with @xcite in that the radii of ultracool dwarfs are statistically smaller than jupiter s radius .",
    "however , the variation of radii among brown dwarfs appears to be appreciable ( table  [ tbl : fit ] ) and may not be represented by a single mean value .",
    "for this reason , the so - called empirical effective temperature can not be completely reliable .",
    "although we use it as a guideline in our analysis ( sections  [ sec : obsvsucm ] & [ sec : ucmfitresults ] ) , it may even be misleading as we showed in the case of 2mass j055919@xmath11404 ( section  [ sec : obsvsucm ] ) .    also , because of such variations of the radii in real ultracool dwarfs , an attempt to analyze the observed spectra on an absolute scale based on an assumed radius of @xmath110 @xcite does not necessarily work well . for example , we showed before that the near infrared spectrum of 2mass j152322@xmath33014 observed with subaru , reduced to an absolute scale with the known parallax and with the assumption of @xmath110 , agreed with the predicted spectrum of @xmath33 1300k .",
    "for this reason , we suggested @xmath10 of this object to be @xmath111k @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the shape of the _ akari _ spectrum can be best explained by @xmath33 1500k ( section  [ sec : fit1523 ] ) , and that a consistency with the sed on an absolute scale can be achieved if we abandon the ad hoc assumption of @xmath110 ( see figure  [ fig : fitall]c ) .    in conclusion , we believe that the observed spectrum ( or relative sed ) can provide a more direct and realistic estimation of the effective temperature of an individual object .",
    "further , an empirical estimation of the radius can be possible if the sed can be reduced to an absolute scale with the known parallax . with this conclusion",
    ", we now think it inappropriate to analyze the observed spectrum in absolute scale based on an ad hoc assumption of @xmath112 , as we proposed before @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath12 is more difficult since the low - resolution infrared spectra depend little on @xmath12 , as can be seen in our figures  [ fig : fit0830 ] & [ fig : fit0559 ] .",
    "also , this difficulty is clearly shown by a goodness - of - fit ( statistic @xmath113 defined by equation  ( 1 ) in @xcite and shown in their figure  5 , in which @xmath113 only shows minor changes for different @xmath12 s ( possibly except for no cloud case ) .",
    "inspection of table  [ tbl : fit ] reveals that our result appears to be biased towards low gravity , namely @xmath35 for 5 out of 6 objects .",
    "this may be due to the difficulty of gravity determination noted above , at least partly , or may be simply because our sample mostly consists of low gravity objects by chance .",
    "we examine if this may be due to any systematic effects in our ucms .",
    "our gravity determination is essentially based on the gravity dependence of the gas and dust opacities , but we are using more or less standard methods in treating molecular and dust opacities . also , a comparative study of different modeling approaches did not reveal any systematic effect in our models @xcite .",
    "thus we can not identify any systematic effect in our models .",
    "we hope to examine this problem further with a larger sample in future .",
    "@xcite used ultracool dwarf evolution models to transfer their ( @xmath114 ) values to ( @xmath115 ) values , from which they obtained @xmath116 for 2mass j055919@xmath11404 .",
    "this result differs from their result based on their spectral fitting referred to in section  [ sec : obsvsucm ] ( @xmath117 ) , but agrees rather well with our value given in table  [ tbl : fit ] ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus this result can be supporting evidence for our @xmath12 , despite some difficulties noted above .",
    "however , the results based on the evolutionary sequences may suffer more or less similar difficulty to the spectral fitting method , since it depends critically on the physical parameters such as @xmath10 , which can not be very accurate if they are based on the spectral fitting in the limited spectral region ( as will be detailed in section  [ sec : errors ] ) .    given the radius and @xmath12 , it is in principle possible to estimate the mass .",
    "however , seds are not so sensitive to @xmath12 and its accuracy is rather low . for this reason , we believe it impossible to obtain a reasonable mass estimates from our spectra .",
    "inspection of table  [ tbl : fit ] reveals that the resulting @xmath11 s show a variety of values in our limited sample , and this result implies that the dust cloud properties differ significantly among different objects . in modeling dusty dwarfs , it is still difficult to determine the dust cloud properties from the basic physics , and we had to introduce such an empirical parameter as @xmath11 to represent the dust cloud properties , at least partly .",
    "other models of dusty dwarfs also have a more or less similar feature .",
    "for example , @xcite introduced the cloud sedimentation efficiency @xmath102 in their models and , as discussed in section  [ sec : fit0559 ] , their @xmath102 and our @xmath11 consistently showed that the dust cloud in 2mass j055919@xmath11404 is rather thin .",
    "we hope that a larger sample will be analyzed to clarify the nature of dust clouds and that the result will serve as a guide towards a more physical theory of cloud formation in dusty dwarfs .",
    "we assumed that the chemical composition in such unevolved objects as brown dwarfs should be the same as the solar composition .",
    "however , the solar composition itself is by no means well established yet .",
    "for example , we adopted @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( on the scale of @xmath120 ) in our initial version of ucm based on the latest results known at that time @xcite .",
    "however , these values were revised to be @xmath121 and @xmath122 based on the three - dimensional(3d ) time - dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere @xcite and our present version of ucm is based on these revised values as noted previously @xcite .",
    "these values are close to the more recent values of @xmath123 and @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "since a direct determination of abundances in brown dwarfs can not be expected in the near future , we think it best for now to use the most reliable solar composition .    unlike the cases of evolved stars in which the surface chemical composition may suffer drastic variations due to convective dredge - up of the products of nuclear processing in the interior , large variations of the surface chemical composition",
    "may not be expected in brown dwarfs , but a possibility of small variations may not be excluded . as an example , we examine the effect of carbon abundance on co and co@xmath2 features in j083008@xmath34828 and j055919@xmath11404 , since co and co@xmath2 features in these objects could not be reproduced well with the composition we have assumed . for this purpose , we compute two spectra with @xmath124 changed by @xmath125dex compared to the standard composition we have assumed , namely , @xmath121 .",
    "the results for j083008@xmath34828 are shown in the upper diagram of figure  [ fig : ccvmic ] .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath124 by 0.15dex results in a considerable strengthening of the methane bands , but the overall fitting tends to be worse ( compare c with a in the figure ) .",
    "the co@xmath2 and co bands at 4.2 and 4.6 @xmath0 m , respectively , however , do not show any strengthening .",
    "the effect of decreasing @xmath124 by 0.15dex is rather modest ( see d in the figure ) .",
    "the results for j055919@xmath11404 are shown in the lower diagram of figure  [ fig : ccvmic ] .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath124 by @xmath125dex can be noticed on the ch@xmath4 bands , but co@xmath2 and co bands remain almost unchanged .",
    "we conclude that the large discrepancies between the observed and predicted co and co@xmath2 bands in j083008@xmath34828 and j055919@xmath11404 can not be the problem of the carbon abundance .",
    "we have assumed the micro - turbulent velocity to be the solar value of 1 kms@xmath37 throughout .",
    "just to see the effect of the micro - turbulent velocity , we increase it to be 2 kms@xmath37 and the resulting spectra are compared with those for the case of 1 kms@xmath37 for j083008@xmath34828 and j055919@xmath11404 in the upper and lower diagrams , respectively , of figure  [ fig : ccvmic ] .",
    "clearly , dependence on the micro - turbulent velocity is quite small ( compare a and b in figure  [ fig : ccvmic ] ) as expected for such high density photospheres dominated by the pressure broadening .      since we examine the effect of @xmath10 by steps of 100k , our @xmath10 can not be more accurate than @xmath126k .",
    "further , combined with the similar uncertainty in @xmath11 , the final uncertainty in our estimation of @xmath10 may be @xmath127k .",
    "but we should notice that the parameters we have found are simply those that explain the _ akari _ spectra in the 2.55.0  @xmath0 m region .",
    "we tried more or less similar analysis of the 1.02.5  @xmath0 m region of our objects and found some differences in the resulting parameters , although the differences are mostly within the errors outlined above . in other words , the solution obtained by fitting other spectral regions may not in general explain the 2.55.0  @xmath0 m spectra . as summarized in figure  [ fig : fitall ] , we are trying to reach a unified understanding of the series of new spectra observed for the first time by _ akari _ covering from mid - l to late - t dwarfs . for this purpose , we believe it best to apply the parameters obtained from the _ akari _ spectra themselves and analyze all our sample consistently .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the effective temperatures obtained by fitting a limited spectral region differ from those obtained by fitting the full sed ( 0.9514.5  @xmath0 m ) by typically @xmath128 200k and by as large as 700k in the worst case .",
    "as noted above , we confirm essentially the same difficulty with our ucm .",
    "the reason for this difficulty may be because the present models are far from perfect . for example , we do not know the exact form of the dust opacities which suffer from many unknown effects ( e.g. composition , size , shape , impurity etc . ) and of the molecular opacities based on imperfect line lists .",
    "moreover , we do not know yet the exact nature of the dust clouds formed in the photosphere of cool dwarfs . for these reasons ,",
    "we think it difficult to expect such rigorous numerical accuracy for brown dwarfs as realized in model photospheres of ordinary stars .",
    "we intended from the beginning that our models can at least be of some help as a guide in interpretation and analysis of the observed data of ultracool dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a more perfect model would allow us to more safely analyze a wider spectral region . however , current models of brown dwarf atmospheres are far from perfection .",
    "fitting of a wider spectral region may sample more regions of uncertain opacities at the same time , and is by no means easier to have better results .",
    "thus we must allow for additional uncertainties beyond those found by fitting one spectral region .",
    "we fully agree with @xcite who concluded that the accurate determination of the physical parameters is still an elusive goal , even though sed fitting method shows reasonable success in general .    for now , we must be satisfied in that our sed fitting analysis based on our ucm has also been done fairly consistently for the new spectral region observed by _",
    "akari_. the ucm is a semi - empirical model in which the property of the dust clouds is represented by a single parameter @xmath11 and , for this very reason , our ucm is free from yet unknown details of the cloud formation processes .",
    "thus , our ucm can be flexible enough to interpret the major characteristics of the observed spectra in terms of a few basic physical parameters .",
    "the ucm , however , assumes lte throughout and hence can not be applied directly to the observed features showing possible deviations from lte .",
    "we will discuss such a case in the next section .",
    "in the previous section , the overall seds can be understood reasonably well with the ucm based on lte , but the observed features of co and co@xmath2 in t - dwarfs ( and possibly late - l dwarfs ) can not be fitted at all with the spectra predicted by the model . as for co , this fact has been known for late - t dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we confirm this fact by the better quality data for t8 dwarf 2mass j041519@xmath10935 ( figure  [ fig : fitall]f ) .",
    "but we also find that co bands are enhanced significantly already in the mid - t dwarf 2mass j055919@xmath11404 ( figure  [ fig : fitall]e ) as well as in the late - l dwarf sdss j083008@xmath34828 ( figure  [ fig : fitall]d ) .",
    "a new and more difficult problem is that the co@xmath2 band at 4.2  @xmath0 m is enhanced enormously in all the cool dwarfs later than l9 .",
    "the unexpected detection of co in the late - t dwarf gl  229b has been interpreted as due to vertical mixing of co from the warm layers where co is still abundant to the cooler layers where co is mostly transformed to ch@xmath4 under lte .",
    "this is possible since co is so stable that the time scale @xmath129 of the reaction @xmath130 is very slow compared to the mixing time scale @xmath131 @xcite , and a detailed computation including such a non - equilibrium effect has been carried out ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we try to explain our observations by a simple computation as follows : we show the lte molecular abundances of co , h@xmath2o , ch@xmath4 , and co@xmath2 in the photosphere of 2mass j041519@xmath10935 , using the ucm of ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) = ( 800k , @xmath27 , 4.5 ) , by the solid lines in figure  [ fig : nlte0415 ] .",
    "we assume that the time scale of co destruction @xmath129 is equal to the timescale of mixing @xmath131 at a depth point p in figure  [ fig : nlte0415 ] and co / ch@xmath4 abundance ratio is fixed at the value @xmath132 of that point .",
    "we examine several values of @xmath132 .",
    "the case of @xmath133 is shown in figure  [ fig : nlte0415 ] as an example .",
    "the resulting non - equilibrium abundance of co is indicated by the dashed line . if h@xmath2o and co@xmath2 abundances relative to co are fixed at the values at p as are ch@xmath4 , h@xmath2o as well as ch@xmath4 abundances in the upper layers",

    "the decreases , however , are rather minor and difficult to see in the figure . on the other hand",
    ", co@xmath2 abundance shows a large increase as seen by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : nlte0415 ] .",
    "we compute the spectra based on the non - equilibrium abundances for @xmath134 and @xmath135 together with that of the full lte , and the results are compared with the observed spectrum of 2mass j041519@xmath10935 in figure  [ fig : fitco0415 ] .",
    "inspection of the figure reveals that the observed co spectrum of 2mass j041519@xmath10935 can roughly be accounted for with @xmath135 .",
    "however , the predicted co@xmath2 band is still too weak compared with the observation even for @xmath135 .",
    "of course , there is no reason why co@xmath2/ch@xmath4 ratio can be fixed at the value at point p , since chemical reaction time - scale of co@xmath2 can not be the same as for co. further , there is little possibility that more co@xmath2 can be dredged - up , since co@xmath2 abundance in the deeper layers is not as large as shown in figure  [ fig : nlte0415 ] .    on the other hand , it is possible that co@xmath2 abundance will change to the equilibrium value of the local physical condition if the chemical time scale related to co@xmath2 formation is not as slow as in the case of co. however , if co@xmath2 attains its equilibrium value with the abundant co resulting from vertical mixing , co@xmath2 abundance will be too large .",
    "in fact , co@xmath2 is more abundant than co at @xmath136 in lte as can be inferred from the solid lines in figure  [ fig : nlte0415 ] .",
    "for this reason , we can not assume simply that co@xmath2 can be in equilibrium with co. we can not predict the precise value of co@xmath2 abundance without more detailed non - equilibrium analysis , but we can expect from the above consideration that the co@xmath2 abundance can be somewhat larger than those shown by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : nlte0415 ] in the surface layers of 2mass j041519@xmath10935 and hence the co@xmath2 band could then be stronger than those suggested in figure  [ fig : fitco0415 ] .",
    "a new result of the _ akari _ observation is that the mid - t dwarf 2mass j055919@xmath11404 also shows much stronger co and co@xmath2 bands than those predicted with the use of the ucm based on lte .",

    "we again test a few values of @xmath132 . a case of @xmath137",

    "the predicted spectra for non - equilibrium co and co@xmath2 abundances show additional depression in the region of co @xmath21+@xmath20-branches but little change in the 4.2  @xmath0 m region , compared to the predicted one for the lte case .",
    "this result indicates that the observed co band can be explained at least partly by the vertical mixing model , but the observed co@xmath2 remains completely unexplained .",
    "the observed co feature is still too deep compared with the predicted one , but this may be due to the effect of the deep co@xmath2 feature whose origin is still unknown .",
    "we conclude that the very strong co band observed in 2mass j055919@xmath11404 by _ akari _ can be at least partly explained by the vertical mixing model but the co@xmath2 feature can not at all .",
    "we detected a deep absorption around 4.5  @xmath0 m in the late - l dwarf sdss j083008@xmath34828 and it can be identified with the co @xmath21-branch . the @xmath21-branch tends to be deeper than @xmath20-branch in co because of narrower line separation .",
    "we notice such a structure of the co fundamental consisting of the deep @xmath21-branch and weak @xmath20-branch in 2mass j055919@xmath11404 , and this similarity lends support in identifying the 4.5  @xmath0 m feature in sdss j083008@xmath34828 as due to the @xmath21-branch of co in the relatively low - quality spectrum of this source ( see also , figure  [ fig : ircspec ] ) , even though the presence of such a deep co feature is quite unexpected in l - dwarfs .",
    "we also see that the 4.2  @xmath0 m feature is very strong .    in sdss j083008@xmath34828 ,",
    "the observed co band is quite strong while ch@xmath4 band is fairly weak .",
    "these observed features imply that co is quite abundant , and we confirm this possibility in figure  [ fig : nlte0830 ] where lte abundances of co , co@xmath2 , ch@xmath4 , and h@xmath2o are shown based on the ucm of ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) = ( 1500k , 1700k , 4.5 ) .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : nlte0830 ] reveals that the co abundance under lte is already at its maximum possible value ( i.e. almost all the carbon is in co ) .",
    "then , vertical mixing , if present , can not supply additional co to the upper photosphere and has little effect on the co band strengths .",
    "thus , without any computation of the spectrum , it is clear that the vertical mixing model can not be applied to this late - l dwarf . given that an increase of the co abundance in the photosphere can no longer be possible ( figure  [ fig : nlte0830 ] ) , not only by vertical mixing but also by any other method , some changes in the structures of the photosphere and/or in the atmosphere are required to produce the unusually deep co band observed .",
    "the large strengthening of the co@xmath2 band can not be due to vertical mixing either , since co@xmath2 abundance relative to other molecules is smaller in the deeper layers ( figure  [ fig : nlte0830 ] ) and hence vertical mixing will reduce rather than enhance the co@xmath2 abundance in the upper layers .",
    "this result suggests that a non - equilibrium process other than vertical mixing is needed to explain the large enhancement of the co@xmath2 band .",
    "our analysis confirms that the vertical mixing model can be applied to t - dwarfs at least for co. this result certainly shows that the vertical mixing model provides one possible way to explain the co anomaly , but this fact may not necessarily imply that it is a unique solution for this phenomenon .",
    "however , our analysis can not prove the applicability of the vertical mixing model to the late - l dwarfs .",
    "one problem is that the convective zone is actually situated rather deep in the photosphere of cool dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is said that cool dwarfs are fully convective .",
    "for example , the upper boundary of the convective zone is indicated by the arrow in figures  [ fig : nlte0415 ] & [ fig : nlte0559 ] , and the layers where vertical mixing is expected are well above the convective zone .",
    "hence vertical mixing can not be due to convective mixing .",
    "then , the problem is the unknown mechanism of efficient mixing in the photosphere of t - dwarfs .",
    "a more difficult problem is how to understand the enhancement of co@xmath2 bands at 4.2  @xmath0 m in late - l and t dwarfs throughout .",
    "we confirm that this phenomenon can not be explained by the vertical mixing model at all .",
    "so the question is whether the enhancements of co and co@xmath2 bands in late - l and t dwarfs are due to the same mechanism .",
    "it is still possible that an unknown process resulting in the enhancement of co@xmath2 will also result in the co anomaly . in any case",
    ", the vertical mixing model can not have general applicability , and we must look for a more unified model that can be applied to co and co@xmath2 in l and t - dwarfs .",
    "presently , we have no solution yet as to the reason why co@xmath2 ( and also co at least partly ) are so strong in these objects .",
    "if non - equilibrium processes play major roles , we wonder why the departure from lte can be so significant in the brown dwarf photosphere , where local density is so high that lte condition can be naturally satisfied .",
    "more recently , @xcite analyzed the 0.814.5  @xmath0 m region spectra of many l ",
    "t dwarfs and determined not only effective temperature , surface gravity and grain sedimentation efficiency but also vertical gas transport efficiency , based on the models of @xcite .",
    "they showed that vertical mixing improves the fits and the observed spectra were fitted well in general .",
    "it will be interesting to check whether their models can explain the enhanced co bands in late - l dwarfs .",
    "_ akari _ provides the first and unique opportunity to take brown dwarf spectra in the important wavelength range 2.55.0  @xmath0 m continuously without interference of telluric atmosphere .",
    "in particular , molecular bands of co , ch@xmath4 , and co@xmath2 altogether in one spectrum present a great advantage for investigating chemical processes in the atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs , through quantitative analysis of their carbon budgets .",
    "_ akari _ reveals many remarkable features of ultracool dwarfs .",
    "our observations confirm the presence of co molecules in the brown dwarf atmospheres of all spectral types from l to very late t - type objects .",
    "the fact that all observations ever made for the late - t dwarfs detected co molecules implies that the non - equilibrium chemical composition is a common property of the late - t dwarfs .",
    "it has been discussed that this non - equilibrium abundance is due to vertical mixing in the upper photosphere . the co fundamental band in the t8 dwarf 2mass j041519@xmath10935 and the t4.5 dwarf 2mass j055191@xmath11404 can be accounted for by the vertical mixing model ( section  [ sec : nonlte_latet ] ) .",
    "the idea is also supported by @xcite , and by @xcite based on the analysis of the mid - infrared spectrum of t7.5 dwarf gl  570d taken by _ spitzer_/irs .",
    "they found that the abundance of the nh@xmath18 molecule in the object is almost one order of magnitude smaller than that expected under equilibrium conditions .",
    "it is considered that fresh n@xmath2 molecules are continuously provided from inside .",
    "also , the vertical mixing model is shown to be consistent with the photometry of a larger sample of brown dwarfs obtained with _",
    "spitzer_/irac @xcite .",
    "however , our observations reveal that the co fundamental band is stronger than predicted by the lte models in the late - l dwarf ( sdss j083008@xmath34828 ) . since , unlike in t - dwarfs",
    ", co is already highly abundant in the upper photosphere of these objects , no appreciable increase of co abundance and hence of the co band strength can be expected by additional co from the deeper warm layers .",
    "for this reason , some mechanism(s ) other than vertical mixing should be looked for in late - l dwarfs .",
    "this quest is further strengthened by the detection of co@xmath2 by _ akari _ as discussed below .",
    "a new piece of information provided by _ akari _ is the detection of co@xmath2 molecule .",
    "the co@xmath2 band is never observable from the ground , and its 4.2  @xmath0 m band is just outside of _ spitzer_/irs coverage .",
    "gas phase co@xmath2 in stellar atmospheres was first detected in late - type giants by _",
    "iso_/sws observations .",
    "it was rather unexpected that in addition to the stretching - mode absorption band at 4.2  @xmath0 m , the bending mode ro - vibrational bands in the 15  @xmath0 m region are often seen in these stars , sometimes in emission @xcite .",
    "the co@xmath2 band is generally stronger than those expected from the lte models , implying that some kinds of non - equilibrium processes , either formation of the molecule or radiative excitation , might play a role in the atmospheres of such stars .",
    "the situation is of course quite different in brown dwarfs , with lower temperature and much higher surface density than in red giants .",
    "some amount of the co@xmath2 molecule is expected under lte conditions in brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "though the relative abundance with respect to that of h@xmath2o and ch@xmath4 is small ( figures  [ fig : nlte0415 ] ,  [ fig : nlte0559 ] ,  &  [ fig : nlte0830 ] ) , the high @xmath39-value of this molecule helps to form a rather strong absorption band at 4.2  @xmath0 m region as shown in section  [ sec : predspec ] ( see figure  [ fig : co2 ] ) .",
    "however , a simple comparison with the model tells us that observed absorption is much stronger than expected .",
    "we estimate the temperatures and column densities of the extra co@xmath2 and co absorption components in 2mass j055919@xmath11404 and sdss j083008@xmath34828 .",
    "the observed spectra are divided by the best fit ucm spectra shown in figure  [ fig : fitall ] , and the residual spectra are fitted by two - layers plane - parallel model with given excitation temperature @xmath139 and column density @xmath140 for each molecule . in this simple model",
    "we adopt a gaussian line width of fwhm = 30  kms@xmath37 based upon measurements of h@xmath2o lines by high - resolution spectroscopy in the j - band @xcite . because of the simplicity of the model , the fitting results are suitable mainly for order of magnitude discussions .",
    "the excitation temperature is only mildly constrained by the band shape .",
    "nevertheless , we obtain ( @xmath139 , @xmath140)@xmath141 = ( 800 k , @xmath142@xmath90 ) and ( @xmath139 , @xmath140)@xmath143 = ( 1000 k , @xmath144@xmath90 ) for 2mass j055919@xmath11404 , and ( @xmath139 , @xmath140)@xmath141 = ( 800 k , @xmath145@xmath90 ) and ( @xmath139 , @xmath140)@xmath143 = ( 1000 k , @xmath146@xmath90 ) for sdss j083008@xmath34828 , respectively .",
    "the results for 2mass j055919@xmath11404 are presented in figure  [ fig : extfit ] as an example .",
    "considering that co molecules with higher excitation temperature may located in a slightly interior portion of the photosphere , the ratio of the column densities @xmath147 indicates lower limits of the abundance ratio of the two molecules .",
    "it is found that co@xmath2 is obviously overabundant compared to co than predicted by the ucm ( figures  [ fig : nlte0559 ] & [ fig : nlte0830 ] ) .",
    "this implies that non - equilibrium processes other than vertical mixing may play a role in determining the molecular abundances especially for co@xmath2 .",
    "another possibility is the presence of extended atmosphere beyond the hydrostatic photospheres , similarly in the case of red - giants .",
    "it is interesting that _ spitzer_/irs observation did not detect any clear co@xmath2 bands in the 15  @xmath0 m region in any brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "if the co@xmath2 molecular layer is extended , emission beyond the photosphere could compensate for the absorption and the observed band strength would be weakened .",
    "this effect is usually more effective at longer wavelengths .",
    "of course , there is a more conventional explanation that the heavy opacity of h@xmath2o veils the wavelength region completely .",
    "the h@xmath2o opacity reaches a minimum around 4  @xmath0 m and makes the 4.2  @xmath0 m band visible .",
    "if this is the case , the co@xmath2 molecules would be located in the same layer , or in layers internal to the h@xmath2o .",
    "this may be a constraint on constructing chemical models of the brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "high dispersion spectroscopy in the 4 & 15 @xmath0 m region from space is an ideal tool for investigating this problem .",
    "although non - equilibrium conditions for the co / ch@xmath4 and nh@xmath18/n@xmath2 ratios appeared to be explained by the vertical mixing model at least in late - t dwarfs , the unexpected detection of co@xmath2 by _ akari _ casts doubt as to whether the vertical mixing model alone could explain the carbon chemistry even in late - t dwarfs .",
    "in fact , there is no reason why we expect excess co@xmath2 by the vertical mixing model ( section  [ sec : nonlte_midt ] ) and there should be some other mechanism to produce excess co@xmath2 .",

    "<S> near - infrared medium - resolution spectra of seven bright brown dwarfs are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra were obtained with the infrared camera ( irc ) on board the infrared astronomical satellite _ akari _ , covering 2.55.0  @xmath0 m with a spectral resolution of approximately 120 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral types of the objects range from l5 to t8 , and enable us to study the spectral evolution of brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the observed spectra are in general consistent with the predictions from the previous observations and photospheric models ; spectra of l - type dwarfs are characterized by continuum opacity from dust clouds in the photosphere , while very strong molecular absorption bands dominate the spectra in the t - type dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the co fundamental band around 4.6  @xmath0 m is clearly seen even in the t8 dwarf 2mass j041519@xmath10935 , confirming the presence of non - equilibrium chemical state in the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify the co@xmath2 fundamental stretching - mode band at 4.2  @xmath0 m for the first time in the spectra of late - l and t - type brown dwarfs .    as a preliminary step towards interpretation of the data obtained by _ akari _ , we analyze the observed spectra by comparing with the predicted ones based on the unified cloudy model ( ucm ) . although overall spectral energy distributions ( seds ) can be reasonably fitted with the ucm , observed co and co@xmath2 bands in late - l and t - dwarfs are unexpectedly stronger than the model predictions assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the vertical mixing model and find that this model explains the co band at least partly in the t - dwarfs 2mass j041519@xmath10935 and 2mass j055919@xmath11404 . </S>",
    "<S> the co fundamental band also shows excess absorption against the predicted one in the l9 dwarf sdss j083008@xmath34828 . since co is already highly abundant in the upper photospheres of late - l dwarfs , the extra co by vertical mixing has little effect on the co band strengths , and the vertical mixing model </S>",
    "<S> can not be applied to this l - dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> a more serious problem is that the significant enhancement of the co@xmath2 4.2  @xmath0 m band in both the late - l and t dwarfs can not be explained at all by the vertical mixing model . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of the co@xmath2 band remains puzzling . </S>"
