    "hadronic @xmath0 decays with a @xmath1 meson in the final state are valuable to investigate qcd at a low mass scale .",
    "however , they have never been observed due to their small branching fractions . the decay @xmath4 is cabibbo - suppressed and further restricted by its small phase space , while the decay @xmath5 is suppressed by the ozi rule although it is cabibbo - allowed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "the branching fraction of the former can roughly be estimated by scaling the analogous cabibbo - allowed decay @xmath6  @xcite by @xmath7 and the ratio of the phase space of the two decays , resulting in @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , the vector dominance model predicts @xmath9  @xcite , whereas the cvc upper limit following from the cross section for @xmath10 is @xmath11 at the 90% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "previously , the cleo collaboration searched for these decays using 3.1 fb@xmath2 of data taken on the @xmath12 resonance .",
    "they set upper limits of @xmath13 and @xmath14 at the 90% confidence level , depending on the mechanism assumed for the decay  @xcite .",
    "here we report the first measurement of the @xmath4 decay .",
    "( throughout this paper charge - conjugate states are implied . )",
    "we also observe for the first time the decay @xmath15 , but it is treated here as a background process , together with the kinematically allowed but phase - space suppressed decays @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . the result is based on a data sample of 401 fb@xmath2 corresponding to @xmath18 @xmath19 pairs collected near the @xmath12 resonance with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath20 ( 3.5 on 8  gev ) collider  @xcite .    the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector , a 50-layer central drift chamber , an array of aerogel threshold erenkov counters , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath21 mesons and identify muons .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two inner detector configurations were used . a 2.0 cm radius beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector",
    "were used for the first sample of 158 fb@xmath2 , while a 1.5 cm radius beampipe , a 4-layer silicon detector and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 244 fb@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "we look for @xmath22 candidates in the reaction @xmath23 with the following signature :    @xmath24 + @xmath25 + @xmath26 , + where ` missing ' denotes other possible daughters not reconstructed .",
    "the detection of @xmath1 mesons relies on the @xmath27 decay ( @xmath28  @xcite ) ; the final evaluation of the signal yield is carried out using the @xmath29 invariant mass distribution .",
    "the selection criteria described below are determined from studies of monte - carlo ( mc ) simulated events .",
    "the background samples consist of @xmath30 ( 1570 fb@xmath2 , which does not include any decay mode with a @xmath1 meson ) and @xmath31 continuum , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and two - photon processes . for signal ,",
    "we generate samples with @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 events .    the transverse momentum for a charged track is required to be larger than 0.06 gev/@xmath39 in the barrel region ( @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the polar angle relative to the direction opposite to that of the incident @xmath42 beam in the laboratory frame ) and 0.1 gev/@xmath39 in the endcap region ( @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) .",
    "the energy of photon candidates is required to be larger than 0.1 gev in both regions .    to select a @xmath0-pair sample , we require four charged tracks in an event with zero net charge , and a total energy of charged tracks and photons in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame less than 11 gev .",
    "we also require that the missing momentum in the laboratory frame be greater than 0.1 gev/@xmath39 , and that its direction be within the detector acceptance , where the missing momentum is defined as the difference between the momentum of the initial @xmath20 system , and the sum of the observed momentum vectors .",
    "the event is subdivided into 3-prong and 1-prong hemispheres according to the thrust axis in the cm frame .",
    "these are referred to as the signal and tag side , respectively .",
    "we allow at most one photon on the tag side to account for initial state radiation , while requiring no extra photons on the signal side to reduce the @xmath45 backgrounds .",
    "we require @xmath46 to reduce backgrounds from other @xmath0 decays and @xmath45 processes , where @xmath47 is the opening angle between the thrust axis ( on the signal side ) and the missing momentum in the cm frame . in order to remove the @xmath45 background",
    ", we require that the invariant mass of the particles on the tag side ( if a @xmath48 is present ) be less than 1.8 gev/@xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "similarly , the effective mass of the signal side must be less than 1.8 gev/@xmath49 .",
    "moreover , we require that the lepton likelihood ratio @xmath51 be greater than 0.1 for the charged track on the tag side . here",
    "@xmath52 is the likelihood ratio for a charged particle of type @xmath53 ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) , defined as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the likelihood for particle type hypothesis @xmath53 , determined from responses of the relevant detectors  @xcite .",
    "the efficiencies for muon and electron identification are 92% for momenta larger than 1.0 gev/@xmath39 and 94% for momenta larger than 0.5 gev/@xmath39 , respectively .",
    "we require that both kaon daughters of the @xmath1 candidate have kaon likelihood ratios @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the kaon identification efficiency is 82% . to suppress combinatorial backgrounds from other @xmath0 decays and @xmath45 processes , we require that the @xmath1 momentum be greater than 1.5 gev/@xmath39 in the cm frame . after these requirements , the remaining contributions from @xmath32 , @xmath33 , bhabha , @xmath62 pair and two - photon backgrounds are negligible .    to separate @xmath63 from @xmath37 , the remaining charged track is required to satisfy the same kaon identification criteria as the @xmath1 daughters .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath45 backgrounds are reduced by requiring that the opening angle ( @xmath64 ) between the @xmath1 and @xmath65 in the cm frame satisfy @xmath66 , and that the cm momentum of the @xmath67 system be greater than 3.5 gev/@xmath39 . for @xmath68",
    ", we require that the charged track be identified as a pion , @xmath69 , and that the opening angle between the @xmath1 and @xmath70 in the cm frame satisfy @xmath71 .",
    "this last requirement suppresses the background from @xmath35 and @xmath72 .    figure  [ fig : fdata](a ) shows the @xmath29 invariant mass distribution after all @xmath35 selection requirements . as there are two possible @xmath29 combinations from the @xmath73 tracks on the signal side , this distribution has two entries per event .",
    "therefore , the signal mc shape includes a long tail due to the wrong @xmath74 combination .",
    "non - resonant backgrounds arise mainly from @xmath75 , which has a branching fraction of @xmath76  @xcite .",
