    "quantum computation offers exciting possibilities of solving complex computational problems using algorithms which exploit the quantum nature of the system .",
    "the idea , first proposed by feynman@xmath0 , is being feverishly pursued by many [ 2 - 6 ] .",
    "several algorithms like shor s factorization algorithm , grover s search algorithm , deutsch - jozsa algorithm , quantum fourier transform , quantum counting and quantum error - correction codes have been developed and have clearly established the premise [ 7 - 24 ] .",
    "the last step in quantum information processing and quantum simulations is the measurement of the output quantum state , known as quantum state tomography . in the case of ensemble systems",
    "this amounts to measuring the output density matrix .",
    "the output state of a quantum algorithm normally corresponds to some classical information and therefore , it is sufficient to measure all the diagonal elements of the density matrix which corresponds to the probabilities of various eigenstates .",
    "however , full quantum state tomography is generally carried out wherever possible , because of the following reasons ; ( i ) knowledge of the full output density matrix allows one to find out the experimental errors and to calculate the fidelity of the implementation @xcite , and ( ii ) if one wishes to monitor the flow of the implementation of an algorithm at any intermediate step , then the best option is to measure the full interemediate density matrix @xcite .    for an n - qubit ensemble system ,",
    "the size of the hilbert space increases as 2@xmath1 and the number of density matrix elements increases as 2@xmath22@xmath1 . of these",
    "there are @xmath3 independent elements , of which @xmath4 elements are one qubit single quantum observable coherences . to measure the remaining elements , a series of one - dimensional experiments with readout pulses to rotate the unobservables into observables ,",
    "have been used @xcite . here",
    "we propose a new method for quantum state tomography based on the two - dimensional fourier transform technique , where all the off - diagonal elements of a density matrix , both unobservable and observable , are measured in a two dimensional experiment .",
    "all the diagonal elements are measured in another one - dimensional experiment .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the earlier method of tomography @xcite involving a large number of different measurements ; while works well for small spin systems , becomes `` prohibitively complex '' for large spin systems .",
    "such large systems can be easily tomographed using the proposed method .",
    "it may be mentioned here , that the proposed method uses a two dimensional experiment and requires several @xmath5 increments . in principle",
    "the size of two dimensional data is independent of the number of spins ( qubits ) .",
    "however , the number of quantus increase linearly with the number of spins . to maintain the same resolution for large number of spins ( qubits )",
    ", the number of @xmath5 increments may have to be increased appropriately ( at best linearly ) .",
    "it may be recalled that the same principle is applied to two dimensional nmr of biomolecules , where the size of data is independent of the size of biomolecules @xcite .",
    "the proposed method can also be used for tomography in a wider range of spin systems , i.e. quadrupolar or strongly coupled systems , and it requires non - selective r.f .",
    "pulses which are devoid of errors caused by the selective pulses used by the earlier method @xcite .",
    "the method is explained using a 2-qubit system and demonstrated on 2 and 4-qubit systems using simulations .",
    "the method is based on the technique of indirect detection of multiple quantum coherences in nmr spectroscopy by two dimensional fourier transform technique @xcite , wherein all the off - diagonal elements are measured in a two - dimensional experiment ( pulse sequence @xmath6 ) .",
    "the diagonal elements of the density matrix are measured in another one - dimensional experiment ( pulse sequence @xmath7 ) .",
    "the nmr pulse sequences for the two experiments are , @xmath8 where @xmath5 and @xmath9 are the variable time periods of system evolution , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the rf pulses , and @xmath13 is the field - gradient pulse .    in experiment 1(a ) , a given density matrix @xmath14 is allowed to evolve for a time @xmath5 , at the end of which a @xmath10 pulse transform every element into all other elements of the density matrix , including diagonal elements .",
    "the @xmath13 pulse dephases the off - diagonal elements averaging them to zero , and retains only the diagonal elements .",
    "a @xmath11 pulse transforms the diagonal elements into all elements of the density matrix including single qubit single quantum coherences .",
    "these single quantum coherences are then detected as a function of time variable @xmath9 .",
    "a series of experiments are performed by systematic increment of the @xmath5 period and the collected two - dimensional time domain data set @xmath15 is double fourier transformed yielding a two - dimensional frequency domain spectrum @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath16 contains along @xmath17 all single qubit single quantum coherences and along @xmath18 , contribution of every off - diagonal elements of the density matrix to these transitions , dispersed and displayed by their specific frequency of evolution in the time - domain @xmath5 .",

    "the diagonal elements of @xmath14 do not contribute to the spectrum .    to obtain the diagonal elements ; experiment 1(b ) begins by destroying all off - diagonal elements of @xmath14 by a gradient pulse , then using a small angle detection pulse to convert difference in diagonal elements into observable one qubit single quantum coherences by linear response .",
    "the amplitudes of the coherences allow calculation of all the off - diagonal elements .",
    "the above protocol is explained in the following by explicit calculations on a two qubit system .",
    "consider a two qubit system consisting of two spin 1/2 nuclei of larmor frequencies @xmath19 and @xmath20 , coupled by a weak indirect coupling j. the hamiltonian for the system is , @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 are the spin operators",

    "it should be noted that the gradient pulse @xmath13 used in pulse sequences 1(a ) to destroy off - diagonal elements , does not destroy homonuclear zero - quantum coherences . in such cases , an extra small delay @xmath76 along with @xmath13 , randomly varied between each @xmath5 experiment can suppress the homonuclear zero quantum coherence @xcite . in experiment 1(b ) , signal averaging using a few randomly varied @xmath77 along with @xmath13 would suppress the homonuclear zero quantum coherences .",

    "two - dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides an efficient method for the quantum state tomography . only an one - dimensional and a two - dimensional experiment are required for measuring all the elements of the density matrix .",
    "since the earlier method requires a series of one dimensional experiments with different readout pulses , for large spin systems the approach becomes enormously complex @xcite .",

    "pulses which do not introduce such errors .",
    "search of more qubits has led researchers to use strongly coupled spin-1/2 nuclei and quadrupolar nuclei ( spin@xmath841/2 ) oriented in liquid crystalline matrices @xcite . for such systems",
    "the notion of spin - selectivity does not apply , but the proposed method based on non - selective pulses can be used for tomography .",
    "recently , the method was used to tomograph the states while quantum informtion processing in weakly and strongly coupled spin systems @xcite .",
    "this method can also be extended to a 3-dimensional experiment in which quantas of various orders are displaced in different planes of the 3-d experiment , increasing the detectibility and the resolution of the spectrum @xcite .",
