    "in a recent paper , ziman and buek have demonstrated that it is impossible to transform the singlet state of two qubits in a maximally entangled mixed state ( mems ) , via local maps @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such maps describe the action of quantum channels @xmath1 acting on a single qubit of the initial singlet state . when a channel is local , that is when it acts on a single qubit , the corresponding map is subjected to some restrictions .",

    "two - qubit mems states may exist in two subclasses usually denoted as mems i and mems ii @xcite . in section ii , we furnish an explicit representation for two maps @xmath12 and @xmath13 that generate mems i and ii states , respectively . in sec .",
