    "macroscopically , the appearance of vortices is an every - day phenomenon .",
    "hardly anyone has missed the swirl of water going down the drain , or the vortices forming while stirring in a cup of coffee .",
    "correspondingly , on the microscopic level the formation of vortices and vortex lattices is known to lower the energy of a rotating quantum system .",
    "a vortex is then characterised by a singularity encircled by annular currents .    in the 50 s abrikosov predicted the existence of vortices in superconductors subject to a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "almost 50 years later , in 2001 , abo - shaer  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found vortices forming in rotating bose - einstein condensates .",
    "these many - body systems consist of paired electrons and bosonic atoms , respectively .",
    "mean - field approaches are often employed to describe the complex structures that these systems comprise . for bose - einstein condensates",
    ", one often applies the gross - pitaevskii equation . in this way ,",
    "butts and rokhsar  @xcite and later on kavoulakis , pethick and mottelson  @xcite found successive transitions between stable patterns of singly - quantised vortices , as the angular momentum was increased .",
    "surprisingly vortex solutions , as discussed above , can also be found in small fermion systems with non - paired , repulsively interacting particles at large angular momenta  @xcite . such systems could , for instance , be realized in quantum dots  @xcite ( small semiconductor islands confining a finite number of electrons ) at high magnetic fields .",
    "incredibly enough , the vortex formation by repulsively interacting fermions at high angular momenta is very similar to the bosonic case  @xcite : irrespective of the system being bosonic or fermion , vortex solutions govern the ground states in the limit of large angular momenta .",
    "setting a cloud of fermions rotating is equivalent to applying a strong magnetic field . for an electron in a quantum dot , at a certain field strength the system spin - polarises , and",
    "forms a compact droplet where the @xmath1 particles occupy neighbouring single - particle orbitals with angular momenta @xmath2 , all belonging to the so - called lowest landau level ( lll ) with radial quantum numbers @xmath3 .",
    "this compact , so - called `` maximum density droplet '' ( mdd )  @xcite is the finite - size analog to integer filling factors in the bulk  @xcite . at larger fields or similarly",
    ", for higher total angular momenta , the droplet reconstructs its charge distribution .",
    "different scenarios have been suggested ( see @xcite for a review ) : while in the low-@xmath1 limit , the formation of holes at the centre was discussed by macdonald , yang and johnson  @xcite , chamon and wen  @xcite suggested that for larger droplets , the energy could be lowered by splitting off a ( homogeneous ) ring of electrons .",
    "in fact , it turned out later that the formation of a charge density wave along the edge was even more favourable  @xcite .",
    "in this article we re - investigate the reconstruction of the maximum density droplet ( mdd ) in the light of vortex patterns and the apparent analogy to the bosonic case .",
    "we show that , in agreement with the earlier findings of yang _",
    "et al._@xcite , reconstruction of the mdd begins from the edge rather than the dot centre if the electron number exceeds @xmath4 . at smaller dot sizes ,",
    "however , vortices enter the mdd from the edge , in much analogy to the bosonic case  @xcite . the universality between fermion and boson systems discussed by toreblad  _ _ et al.__@xcite holds up to @xmath4 .",
    "for higher @xmath1 , not all vortex solutions appear as ground states .",
    "instead edge reconstruction takes over at the onset of the mdd break - up . in the limit of very large angular momenta , vortices can co - exist with the usual ( chamon - wen ) edge - reconstructed ground states .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath5 , which we investigate , is of two - dimensional nature and describes an interacting finite many - body system under rotation ( or , equivalently , subject to a magnetic field , see appendix ) which is confined by a harmonic oscillator potential : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the particle mass and @xmath8 the confining frequency of the oscillator .",
    "this hamiltonian has , in fact , become the standard choice to model finite quantal systems  it equally well describes the physics of electrons trapped in a quantum dot  @xcite , as bosonic or fermion atoms in a magneto - optical trap  @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensionality originates in the quantum dot from the semiconductor heterostructure . in the atom trap",
    ", it can be designed by the experimental set - up .",
    "in addition , strong rotational motion lowers the effective confinement perpendicular to the axis of rotation .",
    "this leads to a ground state with only the lowest energy level occupied along the @xmath9-direction @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath10 adds rotation at an angular frequency @xmath11 . since the total angular momentum , @xmath12 , is a good quantum number to @xmath13 , it effectively subtracts a term @xmath14 from the energy of the hamiltonian @xmath15 . as a result",
    "a larger @xmath11 will create a ground state with higher total angular momentum . instead of seeking solutions at varying @xmath11 , we follow the tradition in nuclear physics and solve @xmath15 for a given @xmath12 to obtain the total energy , @xmath16 , and the many - body state @xmath17 .",
    "note , that the lowest state for a fixed @xmath12 is not necessarily the ground state of @xmath13 . to find that state",
    ", we still need to subtract @xmath14 .",
    "as is usually done for these systems , the interaction between the electrons in a quantum dot is modelled by the ordinary coulomb repulsion : @xmath18 for trapped , dilute atomic gases it is well known  @xcite that the interaction between the particles are more realistically described by a zero - range potential of the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the scattering length  @xcite .",
    "however , we have recently shown that the dominating features in the boson many - body spectra are to a large extent independent of the two - body interaction  @xcite , and very similar results were obtained both for short - range and coulomb two - body forces in the lowest landau level . for ease of comparison with the electron system under consideration , we thus restrict this study to the usual coulomb interaction , _ both _ in the fermion _ and _ boson case . to simplify the comparison further , only _",
    "one spin state _ will be considered : spin - polarised fermions and bosons with zero spin .    in second",
    "quantisation , here for fermions , we write @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the single - particle part of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath23 is the harmonic oscillator basis and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the corresponding creation and annihilation operators .",
    "one can now simply construct the full hamiltonian matrix and diagonalise it to obtain the energies and corresponding many - particle states .",
    "the many - particle solution @xmath26 for fermions is then given by an expansion in slater determinants @xmath27 , @xmath28 for the bosonic , symmetric solution @xmath29 , eq .  [ secquant ] is similar , with the fermion operators exchanged for the corresponding boson operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this so - called `` exact '' diagonalisation is the brute - force method of many - body quantum mechanics .",
    "however , to name the method `` exact '' is misleading .",
    "a full hamiltonian matrix would be infinitely large , which of course would be impossible to handle .",
    "a further complication is the fact that the size of the hamiltonian matrix rapidly increases , making calculations for more than about six particles extremely time - consuming . in view of the structure of the single particle levels for high magnetic fields  @xcite",
    ", we thus restrict the single particle states to the above mentioned lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "physically this means that we ignore high energy excitations which would mix the lowest and higher landau levels . for both bosons and fermions",
    "this is a common restriction , which is justifiable for dilute quantum gases at very high angular momenta , or at very high magnetic fields .",
    "it allows us to extend the studies to systems with up to 25 particles .",
    "in weakly interacting bosonic systems , which are set rotating , successive transitions between stable vortex states have been found  @xcite for increasing angular momentum . in particular , in a rotating and weakly interacting bosonic system with a short - range interaction , solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation have revealed  @xcite a central one - vortex solution for the ratio of angular momentum to particle number being equal to one , @xmath32 a two - vortex solution at @xmath33 and a three - vortex state at @xmath34 ( in atomic units ) .",
    "assuming similar vortex formation in the ( unpaired ) fermion system the vortex angular momenta are shifted by @xmath35 as compared to the boson system .",
    "this shift corresponds to the many - body configuration of the mdd , which is the fermion equivalent to the boson many - particle ground state .",
    "an intuitive explanation is given by the configurations of the fock states in the lll , i.e. @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of particles in the single - particle state with angular momentum @xmath7 . in the non - rotating ground state in the bosonic case all @xmath1 spin - less particles are occupying the lowest single - particle orbital , the fock state being of the form @xmath38 . for spin - polarised fermions , the pauli principle demands",
    "single occupancies up to the fermi surface , and the fock state of the mdd is a single slater determinant of the form @xmath39 .",
    "as the angular momentum of the mdd equals @xmath35 , a central single vortex in the fermion case should appear at @xmath40 , a two - vortex solution at @xmath41 , and a three - vortex solution correspondingly at @xmath42 .",
    "let us now investigate the rotating fermion system as compared to the rotating boson system . in the lowest landau level , at fixed angular momentum @xmath12 the total energy",
    "is given by @xmath43 where the first term originates from the kinetic energy and the confining potential , and the second term from the interaction energy .",
    "an increase in @xmath44 indicates a centre of mass excitation , whereas variations in @xmath45 imply changes in the interaction energy , which affects the configuration .",
    "+ computationally , there now exist two more simplifying circumstances : ( 1 ) the kinetic energy and the confining potential constitute a diagonal term to the total energy .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to diagonalise only @xmath46 and add the term @xmath47 at the end to obtain the total energy",
    ". the outcome will be the same as including the diagonal terms in the diagonalisation .",
    "( 2 ) the interaction is independent of confining frequency , @xmath8 , since @xmath48 this can easily be verified by writing the expression with second quantisation and comparing the integrals for @xmath49 and @xmath50 a.u .",
    "the results presented are thus independent of confining frequency and it is only necessary to study @xmath51 a.u .",
    "as long as only the lowest landau level is considered .",
    "the interaction energy versus angular momentum is displayed in fig .",
    "[ n12spec ] for fermions ( a ) and bosons ( b ) . following the tradition in nuclear physics , the dashed line connecting the lowest states at fixed @xmath12",
    "is called the `` yrast '' line @xcite , and the spectrum of @xmath15 the yrast spectrum .",
    "the interaction energy is plotted as a function of the above defined unit less variable @xmath52 , which in a boson system corresponds to @xmath53 and in a fermion system to @xmath54 . by this construction",
    "we simplify the comparison between boson and fermion systems , and it also becomes easier to compare systems of differing particle number .",
    "note that @xmath55 in the fermion system corresponds to the mdd . in the boson system",
    ", it describes the @xmath56 ground state .",
    "not surprisingly , both in the boson and fermion spectra ( as shown for @xmath57 in figure  [ n12spec ] ) the interaction energy decreases with increasing @xmath52 : a larger @xmath52-value implies a higher rotation , which pushes the particles further apart .",
    "however , the spectra reveal other striking similarities .",
    "recalling the fact that , due to the pauli principle , the fermion total angular momenta are displaced with respect to the boson systems by the angular momentum of the mdd , we realize that the spectra for fermions and bosons are very similar . the yrast line in both cases shows a pronounced kink at @xmath58 . and",
    "fainter kinks are observed at @xmath59 and at @xmath60 ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ n12spec ] ) . for the boson system",
    "we know these particular @xmath52-values to be related to the formation of vortices . according to the previously discussed results of the gross - pitaevskii equations a one - vortex solution corresponds to exactly @xmath58 , and a two - vortex solution to @xmath61 .",
    "what happens in the fermion system ?    before studying the many - particle states in more detail , it is interesting to explore which @xmath52-values correspond to ground states in the rotating system . in figure  [ n12omega ]",
    "the ground states for increasing @xmath11 have been found by subtracting @xmath14 from @xmath62 .",
    "intriguingly , most of the @xmath52-values corresponding to kinks of the yrast line , including intermediate values @xmath63 and @xmath64 , now reappear .",
    "( note that to increase @xmath11 above @xmath65  a.u .",
    "has no physical meaning .",
    "if the rotational frequency exceeds the confining frequency the effective confinement disappears , see appendix . )    to extract information from the many - particle wavefunctions , one must process the data in some way .",
    "two informative quantities are the occupancies , @xmath66 , of the single particle states , which illustrates to what extent each single particle state ( in the lll ) is present in the many - body configuration , and the radial particle densities , @xmath67 where @xmath68 in polar coordinates .",
    "the occupancies describe which single particle states dominate .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath69 has a magnitude close to zero the radial density will be very small at @xmath70 , since the single particle state ( in the lll ) with @xmath71 has its maximum at @xmath70 .",
    "similarly a minimum at @xmath72 implies a slightly off - centred minimum in the radial density .",
    "hence , a central single vortex should appear as a minimum for @xmath71 in the occupancy and at @xmath70 in the radial density , and a two - vortex state as an off - centred minimum both in the occupancy and in the radial density .    in figure",

    "if we compare with the ground states in the bosonic system , these are @xmath75 and @xmath74 .",
    "even if the state @xmath60 in the fermion system is not a ground state in the rotating system , it is the lowest - energy state at that particular @xmath52 in the yrast spectrum . in the boson case we know that a central single vortex appears at @xmath58 and a two - vortex solution is found at @xmath76 .",
    "as expected , in the fermion system , the central single vortex is clearly visible at @xmath58 .",
    "the two - vortex state , however , is more difficult to identify .",
    "in contrast to mean field methods , for an exact calculation with good angular momentum the particle density has circular symmetry and thus does not display the internal structure directly .",
    "the vortices are averaged over the entire circle and only show as two dips in the radial densities .",
    "the ground state with @xmath59 and the excited state with @xmath60 showing two minima in the radial density thus constitute likely candidates for a two - vortex state .",
    "another implication of many - vortex solutions in the exact result can be found in the occupancies , which display some interesting systematics . to understand these systematics better we chose to study only the structure of the fock state with the largest magnitude in the expansion of @xmath77 ( see eq .",

    "could it be a two - vortex state ? at @xmath79 a triple hole begins to enter the mdd .    as compared to",
    "mean - field approaches , these `` exact '' solutions retain the circular symmetry of the hamiltonian . in order to reveal the internal structure of the many - body wave function , methods such as calculating the pair correlation , looking at a slightly asymmetric confinement potential  @xcite or adding a small perturbation  @xcite have to be used . especially for small @xmath1 , the above methods have shown useful : when , for example , studying pair correlations , fixing one of the very few particles was found to cause too much disturbance in the fermion many - particle configuration to get a meaningful result .",
    "the pair correlation fixes one particle at a point @xmath80 and calculates the density of the remaining @xmath81 particles .",

    "however , in the limit of small @xmath1 , particularly in the fermion case , the removal of one particle effects the density of the remaining particles significantly , and the result can be ambiguous : due to the pauli principle the point , @xmath80 , at which one fermion has been fixed , will be avoided by the other fermions .",
    "a minimum will arise in the pair correlation at this point called the exchange hole .",
    "this makes the detection of vortices in the pair correlations very tedious . particularly in the limit of small @xmath1 , a small displacement of the reference point @xmath83 alters the pair correlations considerably .    to come about this difficulty , two schemes",

    "the pair correlations for @xmath57 have been plotted in figure  [ n12corrdens ] ( fermions ) and figure  [ n12boscorr ] ( bosons ) for the ground state values of @xmath52 in both the fermion and bosonic case . for completeness , the excited state @xmath60 has also been added in the fermion case . apart from this state and the two intermediate states @xmath63 and @xmath64",

    "this corresponds to the shift of the angular momentum @xmath86 of the maximum density droplet in the fermion system .",
    "studying the pair correlations for these @xmath52-values , the entering vortex in the rotating system can clearly be seen , first changing to a central single vortex state at @xmath58 , and then to a double at @xmath60 .",
    "this ( excited ) state is the same two - vortex solution as in the bosonic case , appearing at similar @xmath52 .",
    "the solution at @xmath79 shows a third vortex entering , as expected from the occupancies .",
    "note how the pauli principle affects the fermion pair correlations by introducing the exchange hole ( as marked by a black dot in fig .",

    "these are plotted in figure  [ n12boscorr ] for comparison .",
    "we note that although the pair correlations in general are a bit ambiguous and the results depend strongly on the choice of the reference point , this method was earlier shown  @xcite to yield a similar picture of vortex entry into the rotating cloud as the gross - pitaevskii approach  @xcite .",
    "compared to the mean - field picture the minima will not equal zero due to the zero - point oscillations present in the exact diagonalisation results . +",
    "for particle numbers larger than approximately @xmath87 the central single vortex disappears from the lowest state at @xmath58 and moves up into the spectrum of excited states .",
    "it appears that , in the fermion system , the vortex configuration is not as favourable anymore  @xcite .    in figure  [ n20spec ] the yrast spectrum for @xmath88 fermions",
    "is displayed for increasing values of @xmath52 .",
    "a second order polynomial , @xmath89 , has been subtracted from the interaction energy in order to display the structure of the spectrum in greater detail .",
    "in fact , below @xmath90 , the entering vortex state dominates as it did for smaller particle numbers .",
    "however , at @xmath90 , there exists a level crossing in the yrast spectrum .",
    "the state with the entering vortex becomes an excited state , which corresponds to the central one - vortex configuration at @xmath58 , while a state with a distinct edge becomes most prominent above @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath52-values at which the actual ground states occur in the rotating spectrum , are altered .",
    "the central one - vortex , respectively the entering two - vortex at @xmath58 and @xmath91 , which we saw for @xmath92 fermions , no longer appear as ground states .",

    "all three constitute states with a clear edge , and in particular @xmath93 and @xmath94 are interesting since their edges consist of localised fermions , so - called chamon - wen edges ( see figure  [ n20corr ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the rotating boson system which is known  @xcite to have a central one - vortex ground state at @xmath58 .",
    "a chamon - wen edge becomes favourable when a higher rotation ( or magnetic field ) effectively decreases the radius of the single particle states as compared to the confining trap .",
    "for a rotating system at high angular momentum this would imply an increase in density relative to the confinement with increasing rotational motion , hence effectively compressing the system .",
    "the repulsive coulomb interaction strongly inhibits this , and the maximum density droplet in effect redistributes its particles from lower to higher single particle momentum , leaving some states with @xmath96 unoccupied , giving a ground state with @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ n20occdens ] shows the occupancies and radial densities of some of the lowest energy states along the yrast line for increasing @xmath52 .",
    "both the occupancies and the radial densities imply a chamon - wen edge , i.e. that there exists an edge of redistributed fermions and an inner dense mdd droplet .",

    "note that in the exact result the localisation becomes less pronounced due to the zero point oscillations .    at the first glance one might draw the conclusion that the central single vortex disappears from the lowest energy at @xmath58 since we have increased the number of fermions in the trap .",
    "this suggests a higher particle density , which does not allow for a central minimum , the single vortex .",
    "however , the interaction energy only scales with a factor depending on @xmath8 ( see sec .",
