    "fullerene molecules are a highly stable form of nanoscopic carbon allotrope that can exist at room temperature .",
    "therefore , they are routinely attractive candidates for spectroscopic studies in understanding aspects of fundamental physics both in their vapor and condensed matter phases . technologically also , fullerenes hold the prospect of exciting applications in solid state quantum computations  @xcite , improving the superconducting ability of materials  @xcite , biomedical fields  @xcite , contrast - enhancement research for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , and improving organic photovoltaic devices  @xcite . therefore , investigations of the response of these materials to radiations are valuable . one direction of these studies is to understand the collective response of fullerene electrons to relatively low - energy photons . in an infinite system like graphite , the incoming oscillatory electric field induces plane - wave type plasma oscillations in the electron cloud within the system s translational symmetry .",
    "this can only quantize a surface plasmon quasi - particle , but not the longitudinal ( compressional ) volume plasmon , since light is a transverse wave .",
    "but when the medium has a boundary , the broken translational symmetry enables the plasma wave to reflect and induce other eigen modes of oscillations , including the volume quantization .",
    "in particular , for finite systems with boundaries in all directions , such as fullerenes and metallic nanoclusters , photospectroscopy reveals multiple plasmons that were measured  @xcite .",
    "the photoelectron angular distribution asymmetry  @xcite and the emission time delay  @xcite at the surface plasmon of c@xmath0 also predicted interesting behaviors .",
    "the other direction of fullerene studies involves the response to photons whose energy is higher than the plasmon excitation energies .",
    "these photons with their shorter wavelengths begin to resolve the fullerene molecular geometry , entering the spectral region of photoelectron diffraction .",
    "this effect results into the occurrence of a series of cavity minima observed in the ionization spectra as the integer multiples of the photoelectron half wavelength fit the molecular redii at certain energies  @xcite .",
    "the effect also accompanies a beating modulation in the ionization spectra as a signature of c@xmath0 molecular width  @xcite .",
    "emission delay spectroscopy predicted structures at these minima  @xcite .",
    "since the first observation of c@xmath0 giant plasmon resonance  @xcite , theoretical studies with various levels of approximation and success formed a large body of published research , an account of which up until 2008 can be found in ref .",
    "after 2008 , there have been mainly two lines of theoretical calculations that attempted to account for the atomistic details of the fullerene carbon - core on a truncated icosahedral geometry .",
    "one involves the geometric optimization of the c@xmath0 structure by the commercially available dmol3 software followed by the calculation of kohn - sham ground state and then its linear response to the incoming radiation  @xcite .",
    "the other uses the general access octopus software to directly solve the time - dependent density functional equations for excited c@xmath0 to subsequently fourier transform the density fluctuation to obtain the dynamical structure factor utilized to derive the electron energy - loss signal  @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of these important new developments , the jellium approximation to c@xmath2 ion - core , a model based on which we have developed a linear - response density functional methodology known as the time - dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) , has seen a significant range of success over last several years and continues to remain relevant  @xcite .",
    "this is because of the ease and transparency of this model to capture the primary , robust observable effects and to access the key physics that underpins the photo - dynamics and related spectroscopy .",
    "let us cite two sets of results from our methods that directly connected the experiments : ( i ) our calculations have predicted the photoionization of a second plasmon at a higher energy whose first observation was reported in our joint publications  @xcite with the experimental group for gas phase c@xmath0 anions ; a subsequent experiment accessed this new plasmon even for the neutral c@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) another experiment - theory joint study of ours revealed oscillations in c@xmath0 valence photoemissions providing trains of diffraction minima mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "besides these pivotal results , our jellium - based study also extended to the photoionization of several atomic endofullerene molecules  @xcite and the c@xmath0@c@xmath1 buckyonion  @xcite .",
    "for some of these fullerene systems , tdlda investigations of the photoemission time - delay  @xcite and multitudes of resonant inter - coulombic decay processes  @xcite were also carried out with reasonable success .",
    "one limitation of the kohn - sham density functional method is its approximate treatment of the electron exchange .",
    "this is because the exchange interaction can only be fully treated in a non - local theory such as hartree - fock ( hf ) that exactly cancels out all self - interactions , restoring correct @xmath3 behavior at @xmath4 . in most of our previous calculations involving c@xmath0 and its derivative endo - c@xmath0 compounds we used a widely utilized approximate scheme  @xcite of exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional augmented by an orbit - by - orbit elimination of self - interaction  @xcite originally proposed by perdew and zunger  @xcite .",
    "a different scheme is to use the gradient - corrected xc potential of van leeuwen and baerends  @xcite that intrinsically approximates the correct long distance properties . while we adopted the latter in some of our most recent works , no detailed study on the comparative abilities between the two schemes",
    "has yet been made .",
    "this is the primary objective of the current work that considers the photoionization of the fullerene molecule .",
    "along with c@xmath0 , a larger spherical fullerene , c@xmath1 , has also been considered to further broaden the scope of the comparison .",
    "significant differences from the choice of the xc treatment , both in ground and photoionization descriptions , are uncovered .",
    "improved agreement of c@xmath0 plasmonic spectrum from the gradient - corrected xc approach with the measured data is found .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section ii includes three subsections : a ) the description of jellium core ground state structures with brief accounts of two xc parametrization schemes , b ) comparison of ground state numerical results between two schemes and between two fullerenes , and c ) the essentials of the method that incorporates electron correlations in responding to the radiation ; section iii compares the results of the valence ( subsection a ) and total ( subsection b ) photoemissions , as well as a comparisons with available measurements for c@xmath0 ( subsection c ) .",
    "conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "the details of the method follow the framework as described in ref .",
    "the jellium potentials , @xmath5 , representing 60 and 240 c@xmath2 ions , respectively for c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 , are constructed by smearing the total positive charge over spherical shells with radius @xmath6 and thickness @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath6 is taken to be the known radius of each molecule : 3.54  for c@xmath0 and 7.14  for c@xmath1 .",
    "a constant pseudopotential @xmath8 is added to the jellium for quantitative accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the kohn - sham equations for systems of 240 and 960 electrons , made up of four valence ( @xmath9 ) electrons from each carbon atom , are then solved to obtain the single electron ground state orbitals in the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath7 are determined by requiring both charge neutrality and obtaining the experimental value ( for c@xmath0 ) and the known theoretical value ( for c@xmath1 ) of the first ionization thresholds .",
    "the values of @xmath7 and the binding energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and homo-1 levels of both systems are given in table1 .",
    "using the single - particle density @xmath10 the lda potential can be written as , @xmath11,\\ ] ] where the 2nd and 3rd terms on the right are the direct and xc components . in one scheme",
    ", @xmath12 is parametrized directly from @xmath13 by the following formula  @xcite : @xmath14 & = & -\\left(\\frac{3\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/3 } \\nonumber \\\\   & - & 0.0333\\log\\left[1 + 11.4\\left(\\frac{4\\pi\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{3}\\right)^{1/3}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the first term on the right is exactly derivable by a variational approach from the hf exchange energy of a uniform electron system with a uniform positively charged background and the second term is the so called correlation potential , a quantity not borne in hf formalism . in addition",
    ", we include an appropriate correction to eliminate unphysical electron self - interactions for the @xmath15-th subshell that renders the lda potential orbital - specific  @xcite , @xmath16 - v_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize xc}}[\\rho_i({\\bf r})]).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this correction approximately captures the electron s long range properties .",
    "we use the acronym sic to refer this model .",
    "the other alternative account for xc - functional that utilizes eq .",
    "( [ gl ] ) but further refines it by adding a parametrized potential  @xcite in terms of the density and its gradient @xmath17 as follows , @xmath18^{1/3}}\\frac{x^2}{1 + 3\\beta x \\sinh^{-1}(x)},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is adjustable and @xmath20/\\rho^{4/3}$ ] .",
    "this scheme , termed as lb94 , is known to have lead to a considerable improvement in the asymptotic behavior of the electron when compared to the exact kohn - sham potentials calculated from correlated densities .",
    "consequently , this model is expected to also significantly improve the quality of both the excited and continuum spectra .",
    "we show the ground state radial potentials of c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 obtained via both sic and lb94 in fig.1(b ) where the sic curves , labeled as sic - av , are occupancy - weighted average over all the subshells . this particular shape of the potentials earlier interpreted multiple frequencies in the fourier transform of the measured photoelectron spectra of c@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "yet , note the differences in details from sic to lb94 : ( i ) for c@xmath0 , to retain the exact same configuration of occupied states optimized earlier  @xcite based on a number of experimental findings  @xcite , the lb94 potential gets slightly narrower ( see table1 ) and deeper but with more widening of the wings on either side of the shell .",
    "( ii ) while these general shapes also hold good for c@xmath1 , we note the following . in the absence of enough experimental information",
    ", c@xmath1 ground states were optimized by requiring identical widths and similar first ionization energies ( table1 ) for both sic and lb94 .",
    "this alters some properties of occupied configuration that includes the lb94 homo to be of @xmath21 character ( a level with no radial node ) @xmath22 with a very high angular momentum @xmath23 as opposed to a @xmath24 level ( with one node ) @xmath25 in sic of a lower @xmath26 [ see fig.1(a ) ] .",
    "the direct repercussion of this change on their photoionization cross sections will be discussed below in section iii a. fig.1(a ) illustrates the general differences , sic versus lb94 , of some valence radial wavefunctions .",
    "( iii ) finally , the potential depth decreases from c@xmath0 to c@xmath1 even though the latter accommodates four times more electrons than the former . why does this happen ? to answer , we need to bear in mind that the effective radial potential also includes the angular momentum dependent centrifugal barrier part @xmath27 which varies slower as a function of @xmath28 over the c@xmath1 shell region that is radially farther from c@xmath0 , creating more  energy - room \" for larger c@xmath1 .",
    "indeed , a far denser angular momentum manifold of @xmath24 and @xmath21 energy bands are generally found for c@xmath1 as seen for lb94 bands presented in fig.1(b ) .",
    "c|ccccc & @xmath7 (  ) & homo & be@xmath29 ( ev ) & homo-1 & be@xmath30 ( ev ) + c@xmath0 & 1.50 ( 1.30 ) & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 + c@xmath1 & 1.50 & @xmath25 ( @xmath22 ) & @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) & @xmath37 ( @xmath25 ) & @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) +    our sic and lb94 descriptions of c@xmath0 also produced static dipole polarizability ( sdp ) values of respectively 92.8 @xmath40 and 114 @xmath40 which are reasonably close to the measured value of 76.5 @xmath41 8 @xmath40  @xcite , particularly given that the jellium model disregards the molecular core vibration",
    ". likewise , our calculated values of sdp for c@xmath1 are 565 @xmath40 and 638 @xmath40 , respectively for sic and lb94 .",
    "the slight increase in sdp from sic to lb94 for both fullerenes is due to a somewhat higher spill - out electron density in lb94 .",
    "this spill - out can be recognized by noticing the lb94 potential in fig.1 being a bit wider at the top causing slight outward spreads of the radial wavefunctions .",
    "a time - dependent lda ( tdlda ) approach  @xcite is used to calculate the dynamical response of the compounds to the external dipole field @xmath42 . in this method ,",
    "the photoionization cross section corresponding to a bound - to - continuum dipole transition @xmath43 is @xmath44 where the matrix element @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being the independent - particle lda matrix element ; obviously , @xmath46 solely yields the lda cross section . here",
    "@xmath47 represents the complex induced potential that accounts for electron correlations . in the tdlda , @xmath48 is proportional to the induced frequency - dependent changes in the electron density  @xcite .",
    "this change is @xmath49 where the full susceptibility @xmath50 builds the dynamical correlation from the lda susceptibilities , @xmath51 via the matrix equation @xmath52^{-1}$ ] involving the variation of the ground - state potential @xmath53 with respect to the ground - state density @xmath54 .",

    "the photoionization cross sections of the homo level calculated in tdlda , both in lb94 and sic schemes , are presented in fig.2 .",
    "let us first note that the host of narrow spikes that appears represents single - electron autoionizing resonances .",
    "the positions and shapes of these resonances largely vary between two xc schemes this happens mainly because of their significantly different descriptions of the unoccupied excited states ( that depend on the potential s asymptotic behavior ) , even though their occupied spectra are by and large similar . in fact , it is expected that owing to the better long - range accounts of electronic properties , lb94 resonances are more accurate in all current results . neglecting these single - electron features , broad build - ups of the oscillator strength above 10 ev are due to the two collective plasmon resonances .",
    "the general shape of the curves is qualitatively similar between lb94 and sic for c@xmath0 [ fig.2(a ) ] , largely because the homo levels are of the same @xmath24 symmetry in both the schemes [ fig.1(a ) ] .",
    "in contrast , due to the different symmetries of homo for c@xmath1 [ fig.1(a ) ] , the broad shapes of the lb94 and sic curves in fig.2(b ) noticeably differ from each other . in all the curves ,",
    "there appear some imposing oscillation - type structures above 30 ev that somewhat mask the second ( 40-ev ) plasmon .",
    "further , comparing fig.1(a ) with ( b ) , we note a general shift of the plasmonic enhancements toward lower energies for larger c@xmath1 similar to the known trend in the size dependence of plasmons in noble metal cluster studies  @xcite .",
    "tdlda cross sections for homo-1 level are shown in fig.3 . since for each fullerene",
    "the homo-1 level retains the same @xmath24 symmetry going from sic to lb94 , the broad shapes of the curves obtained from these approximations compare well , barring the mismatch in details including in the single - electron resonances .",
    "we also note here the superposed oscillatory structures at higher energies and the red - shift of the plasmon resonances in c@xmath1 compared to c@xmath0 as in the case of homo .",
    "cleaner shapes of the plasmon resonances are more readily captured in the total cross sections that we discuss in the next subsection .",
    "we address at this point a photoelectron diffraction - driven phenomenon that begins to surface from the waning region of the higher energy plasmon where the collective effect starts to weaken .",
    "an interference between photoelectron waves , predominantly produced at the boundaries of the fullerene shell , underpins this process .",
    "this essentially single - electron effect is the root cause of the oscillations seen at higher energies in figs.2 and 3 that has been observed before in photoelectron spectroscopy  @xcite and theoretically discussed at great lengths  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "[ ] , one can simply model these oscillations in a @xmath61-level cross section by @xmath62,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is a steady energy - dependent part , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the values of the radial bound wavefunction at inner ( @xmath66 ) and outer ( @xmath67 ) radii of the fullerene shell , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are respectively proportional to the derivatives of the radial potential [ fig.1(b ) ] at @xmath67 and @xmath66 , and @xmath71 . obviously , the oscillations in photoelectron momentum ( @xmath72 ) depend on the potential shape that also includes the angular momentum dependent centrifugal barrier",
    ". therefore , it is not surprising that the higher energy sub - structures in fig.2(a ) and fig.(3 ) qualitatively match between lb94 and sic which have identical angular momentum symmetry . in fig.2(b ) , however , this matching worsens .",
    "this is the consequence of increased centrifugal barrier from much higher angular momentum of lb94 homo level @xmath22 for c@xmath1 that obliterates the inner radius in the effective potential to effectuate @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ cross_osc ] ) , qualitatively altering the net shape of the oscillations .",
    "the details of this angular momentum effect were discussed earlier  @xcite .",
    "we must also note in figs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) that these higher energy oscillations are in general smaller for c@xmath1 as a consequence of the larger radius of this system leading to higher oscillation  frequencies \" in eq .",
    "( [ cross_osc ] ) .    equation ( [ cross_osc ] ) unravels some further insights .",
    "note that the first three oscillatory terms in this equation carry a constant phase shift @xmath74 , where the dipole selected final angular momentum @xmath75 .",
    "the implication is that each of these oscillations for ionization from two neighboring @xmath76 states will be 180@xmath77 out - of - phase to each other  @xcite .",
    "however , the oscillation from @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ cross_osc ] ) is independent of @xmath76 .",
    "but note that between the ionization of a @xmath24 and a @xmath21 electron this oscillation is roughly opposite , since the product @xmath79 is negative for a @xmath24 radial wave , but positive for a @xmath21  an implication of which will be discussed in the following subsection .",
    "( a ) and c@xmath1 ( b ) .",
    "the corresponding single - electron ( lda ) results using lb94 are also shown.,width=302 ]      figure 4 presents the total tdlda photoionization cross sections and compares them with respective single - electron lda results ( shown only for lb94 ) for both the fullerenes .",
    "the sum over @xmath76 largely cancels out oscillations due to the reason discussed above ( in the last paragraph of subsection iii a ) and makes the broad higher energy plasmon ( hep ) emerge clearly .",
    "in fact , both the plasmon resonances in tdlda stand out in fig.4 against the relatively smooth lda curves .",
    "unlike to the lower energy plasmon ( lep ) resonances , heps exhibit far weaker effects of single - electron resonances but rather long decay tails .",
    "energy red - shifts of the resonances in c@xmath1 compared to those in c@xmath0 are noted along with the fact that c@xmath1 plasmons are utilizing significantly higher oscillator strength density due to its much larger electron pool to collectivize . for each fullerene , significant differences in the resonance widths between lb94 and sic are also noted .",
    "values of various resonance parameters are given in table ii .",
    "from a non - perturbative many body theory , the emergence of plasmon resonances can be thought of as originating from the formation of collective excited states under the influence of external electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "since the collective excitations are energetically embedded in the single - electron ionization channels , they provide alternative ionization pathways degenerate with single - electron channels .",
    "thus , the _ autoionization _ of these collective excited states induce resonant enhancements in the subshell cross sections as shown in figs.2 and 3",
    ". however , from a perturbative approach the plasmon mechanism can be best modeled by fano s interchannel coupling formalism  @xcite . to include the effects of channel - coupling upon the final state wave function of each of the perturbed dipole matrix elements @xmath80",
    "one can write  @xcite ,    @xmath81 is the unperturbed ( lda ) @xmath61 matrix element , @xmath82 s are the unperturbed final continuum channel wave functions of the single - electron channels , and the sum is over all of the photoionization channels except the @xmath61 channel .",
    "the matrix element within the integral of eq.([mat_element ] ) is known as the interchannel coupling matrix element ; the fact that each of @xmath61 initial state orbital overlaps strongly with all other fullerene - orbitals insures that these interchannel coupling matrix elements will be strong .",
    "further , this also justifies the existence of both low and high energy plasmons at exactly the same energies for all the subshells for a given fullerene and implies the various dipole matrix elements are `` in phase '' over the two energy regions ( bands ) of each fullerene [ fig.1(a ) ] .",
    "consequently , the various terms in the sum in eq.([mat_element ] ) will add up _ coherently _ , leading to the dramatic enhancement .",
    "-band cross sections in sic and lb94 for c@xmath0 ( a ) and c@xmath1 ( b ) .",
    "curves are scaled at higher energies to illustrate a strong minimum ( see text ) .",
    "the total cross sections are also displayed for comparisons.,width=302 ]    -band cross sections in sic and lb94 for c@xmath0 ( a ) and c@xmath1 ( b ) .",
    "the total cross sections are also displayed for comparisons.,width=302 ]    equation ( [ mat_element ] ) reveals one further important correlation feature . since a @xmath24 ( or a @xmath21 ) bound orbital will have near - perfect overlaps with other @xmath24 ( or @xmath21 ) orbitals due to their almost identical shape and spatial extent , the interchannel coupling matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ mat_element ] ) will be stronger for a @xmath24-@xmath24 or a @xmath21-@xmath21 self - coupling than a @xmath24-@xmath21 cross - coupling .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the @xmath24 electrons will show a preferred participation for building lep and the @xmath21 for hep . figs.5 and 6 respectively show the only-@xmath24 and only-@xmath21 band cross sections in tdlda calculated in both lb94 and sic . for each fullerene , if we compare the @xmath24 band result in lb94 with the total cross section in lb94 ( also shown ) , a dominant contribution of the @xmath24-cloud to lep and of the @xmath21-cloud to hep are indeed noted . in general , however , it is also obvious from these comparisons that either of lep and hep in a fullerene are of both @xmath24 and @xmath21 mixed character , it is just that one is dominant on the other .    a discussion on the red - shift of tdlda plasmon resonances from c@xmath0 to c@xmath1 [ fig.4 ] may now be in order .",
    "classical plasmon - model  @xcite of a spherical dielectric shell with symmetric and antisymmetric vibrations between the inner and outer surfaces suggests that the midpoint energy between the two resonances to be about the same for c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 , since they have approximately same initial electron densities  @xcite .",
    "according to this model the plasmons are then formed below and above this midpoint energy shifted equally both ways , and this shift grows with the increasing radius , suggesting that the plasmons will be more separated out for c@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "clearly , that is not seen in fig.4 , in which both the plasmons red - shift for c@xmath1 and in fact move close to each other compared to their c@xmath0 results ( see table .",
    "ii for the actual values ) , suggesting that quantum effects play an important role .",
    "one possible way to understand this phenomenon quantum mechanically is to recall in fig.1(b ) that the c@xmath1 ground state potential is shallower while accommodating a number of electrons four times that of c@xmath0 producing far compact energy levels .",
    "this suggests a decrease of the _ average _ ground state binding energy for c@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , since in the spirit of eq .",
    "( [ mat_element ] ) the plasmons can be interpreted as the coherence in close - packed single - electron excitations , it is only expected that the plasmons will begin to excite at lower photon energies causing their early onsets for c@xmath1 , as seen in fig.4 .",
    "in fact , this trend of red - shifting plasmons with increasing fullerene size should be rather generic , at least in the jellium based quantum calculations .",
    "an insight in the phenomenon can be motivated by perceiving a collective mode as having a natural oscillation frequency @xmath83 of a mass density ( @xmath54 ) on a spring of stiffness @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "thus , a shallower binding potential with higher electron population for c@xmath1 translates to the loosening of the spring decreasing @xmath84 and thereby its resonant frequencies .",
    "let us now compare between the predictions of lb94 and sic for the band - cross sections .",
    "for the @xmath24-band , lb94 retains a contribution approximately similar to that of sic at lep , but shows depletion at hep which is more prominent for c@xmath0 [ fig.5(a ) ] than c@xmath1 [ fig.5(b ) ] . for the @xmath21-band , on the other hand , a notably higher contribution to lep and some increase at hep by lb94 for both",
    "the systems are found [ fig.6 ] .",
    "there are more .",
    "our discussions following eq .",
    "( [ cross_osc ] ) indicate that the @xmath76-sum over @xmath24 or @xmath21 cross sections will significantly weaken the diffraction oscillations coming from the first three oscillatory terms in eq .",
    "( [ cross_osc ] ) , while the fourth oscillation @xmath85 will survive being free of @xmath76 . as a result , in the band - cross sections this @xmath7-dependent oscillation will dominate .",
    "since @xmath7 slightly shortened in lb94 than sic for c@xmath0 [ fig.1(b ) ] , @xmath24-band lb94 curve in fig.5(a ) produces a longer wavelength in @xmath72 to induce its first minimum above 100 ev at an energy higher than that in sic .",
    "the equality of @xmath7 in lb94 versus sic for c@xmath1 , on the other hand , justifies the occurrence of these minima at about the same energy as in @xmath24-band results for this fullerene [ fig.5(b ) ] .",
    "however , this effect is not so intuitive for the @xmath21-band case . as seen , while the minimum in lb94 for c@xmath0 [ fig.6(a ) ]",
    "does appear at higher energies than the sic minimum , they do not seem to coincide for c@xmath1 [ fig.6(b ) ] as they did for c@xmath0 .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that the @xmath21 states for c@xmath1 , reaching very high in @xmath76 values compared to their counterparts in c@xmath0 , produce such strong centrifugal repulsions that the effective potentials for high @xmath76 considerably deform rendering the role of @xmath7 less meaningful  @xcite .",
    "measurements  @xcite of plasmon resonances in the photoionization of neutral and ionic c@xmath0 produced relatively smooth curves without any evidence of autoionizing resonances , which exist in our theoretical tdlda results .",
    "as discussed in details in our earlier study  @xcite , this is likely because the coupling of electronic motions with the temperature - induced vibration modes of the core  @xcite and the fluctuation of the cluster shape around the shape at absolute zero  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the inherent over - delocalization of jellium models predicts autoionizing resonances that are too narrow , as seen in our results .",
    "therefore , in fig.7 , we fit the non - spiky background parts of our tdlda total cross sections obtained via lb94 for both the fullerenes using a formula that includes two lorentzian line profiles .",
    "we further present in fig.7 , two similar fitting curves for the sic results of the fullerenes . for both fullerene systems , table 2",

    "we recall the spirit of a classical oscillator model of dielectric shell that the plasmon frequencies are proportional to the square - root of the ratio of rigidity to density ( @xmath88 , in analogy to the oscillation frequency of a mass on a spring of stiffness constant @xmath84 ) introduced in the previous subsection .",
    "note , lb94 radial waves being slightly more spread out than their sic counterparts occupy a larger space effectively decreasing the density .",
    "this explains the blue - shift of lb94 plasmons .",
    "this trend in lb94 is an improvement , since jellium based prediction of c@xmath0 plasmon resonance energies are known to be below their measured values  @xcite .",
    "however , this trend is reversed for c@xmath1 hep where lb94 moves this plasmon lower in energy by more than 2 ev from its sic prediction , ascertaining the importance of quantum effects to capture the details of these resonances .",
    "furthermore , the lb94 width of c@xmath0 lep is found to be 3.5 ev , which is an increase of 40% over its sic value of 2.5 ev , while this increase is 30% for c@xmath0",
    "hep . more than a double increase of width for c@xmath1 lep is found going from sic to lb94 , while again , this trend reverses by a small amount for c@xmath1 hep .",
    "significant variations in the osd utilized by each plasmons for either system between two xc approximations are also noted in table 2 , accounting for the detailed differences that the two calculation schemes generate .",
    "comparisons of the results between the two fullerenes in fig.7 as well as in table 1 indicate a generic red - shift of plasmon energies for the larger fullerene c@xmath1 , as noted and discussed earlier .",
    "we also find in table 2 a general trend of the width @xmath87 to decrease with the increasing size of fullerene , except for c@xmath1 hep in sic .",
    "further note that while for c@xmath0 lep the osd value increases from sic to lb94 , the trend is found opposite for this resonance of c@xmath1 . for the hep , either fullerene exhibits decrease in osd going from sic to lb94 .",
    "fig.7 further includes two sets of experimental measurements for c@xmath0 , where the data from hertel et al  @xcite are red - shifted by 3 ev and those from reinkster et al  @xcite by 1 ev to match respectively with the energies of lep and hep calculated in lb94 . as evident ,",
    "the modifications in @xmath87 and osd , as brought about by the lb94 scheme , indicate an improved agreement with experimental results compared to what sic achieves .",
    "we must also note that in a jellium model , the plasmon resonances only decay via the degenerate single - electron channels . in the real system , however , there would be additional effects from the independent local ion sites positioned based on an appropriate atomistic symmetry , at least for relatively more tightly bound electrons .",
    "as shown in detailed with sic results in ref .",
    "[ ] , in order to account for these additional decay channels , the theoretical cross section in a jellium frame must be convoluted with a small width in order for a more meaningful comparison with measurements . with the already improved agreement of the current  zero - width \" results of lb94 , it is only expected that such a convolution will further better the agreement with the experiment .",
    "in conclusion , the work accounts for various robust similarities but detailed differences between the results obtained via two standard xc schemes , sic and lb94 , in the framework of density functional description of delocalized valence electrons of the fullerene molecule where the ionic core is treated as a jellium shell .",
    "the focus has been applied to understand both the ground state and single - photoionization properties of the system . for the ionization study , the ultraviolet energy range of plasmon activities and above - plasmon soft x - ray range were considered . the comparison between the results of two prototypical spherical fullerenes , c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 , further unravels the scopes of validity of these two theoretical schemes .",
    "a natural next step is to consider the influence of xc formalism on the photospectroscopy of non - spherical fullerenes , which , however , is a topic for our future research . to this end , within the known limitation of the jellium description of the molecular ion - core , the gradient corrected lb94 formalism seems to bring the results closer to the measurements on c@xmath0 over the plasmon resonance energy region .",
    "we hope that with possible future experiments with c@xmath1 the success of lb94 scheme can be verified for larger fullerene systems as well .",
