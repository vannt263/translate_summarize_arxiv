    "+ a prediction of these simulations is that there should be an association between agn and starburst events",
    ". examples of such composite objects are rather isolated in the literature however ( cid fernandes et al .",

    "this observational fact may point to a more complex agn / starburst connection than that adopted in current models .",

    "the majority of these systems are starburst / agn composites thereby providing the opportunity to explore the relation between sbh growth and galaxy formation .",
    "the x - ray/@xmath96 sources follow the broad correlation between star - formation rate ( approximated by the @xmath52 ) and sbh accretion rate ( approximated by @xmath79 ) for broad line qsos , suggesting that these two processes are linked .",
    "we do not find evidence that the x - ray/@xmath1 are more obscured than the overall x - ray population , contrary to the predictions of some agn / starburst co - evolution models . also , the x - ray/@xmath81 population appears to avoid the most intense starbusts for their stellar mass .",
    "this may indicate agn driven moderation of the star - formation in the host galaxy .",
