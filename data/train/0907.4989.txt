    "lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) are galaxies identified by means of their ly@xmath0 emission line , the strength and width of which makes the detection unambiguous to a large extent .",
    "recently , there has been a massive surge in the amount of data available on these high redshift galaxies , specially those detected using the narrow band technique ( kashikawa et al .",
    "2006 ; shimasaku et al .",
    "2006 ; dawson et al . 2007 ; gronwall et al . 2007 ;",
    "murayama et al .",
    "2007 ; ouchi et al .",
    "this has enabled the ly@xmath0 and uv luminosity functions ( lf ) and the equivalent width ( ew ) distribution to be studied and understood statistically which has made laes important as both probes of reionization and high redshift galaxy evolution .    a number of theoretical models , both semi - analytic ( santos 2004 ; dijkstra et al . 2007a , b ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; mao et al . 2007 ; dayal et al . 2008 ) and those involving simulations ( mcquinn et al . 2007",
    "; nagamine et al .",
    "2008 ) have been put forward to reproduce the observed data sets and put constraints on the ionization state of the igm . however , the physical properties of laes including the star formation rates ( sfr ) , metallicity , age and initial mass function ( imf ) have been the subject of much debate .    to this end , in dayal et al .",
    "( 2009a ) we used state of the art cosmological sph simulations coupled with a ly@xmath0/continuum production / transmission model to infer the properties of laes . using the sfr , age , metallicity for each galaxy as obtained from the simulation , a salpeter imf and the early reionization model ( erm , gallerani et al .",
    "2007 ) , we calculated the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity for each galaxy to identify the population that would be observed as laes based on the current observational limits .",
    "we found that at @xmath8 , the sfr are in the range @xmath9 , the ages range from @xmath10 myr , the average stellar metallicity , @xmath11 and the color excess , @xmath12 .",
    "we thus showed that laes are intermediate age objects , with stellar metallicity higher than the generally assumed value of @xmath13% @xmath14 and dust extinction that is very much consistent with other works ( lai et al .",
    "2007 ; nagamine et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the only free parameters left in this work were the escape fractions of ly@xmath0 ( @xmath15 ) and continuum photons ( @xmath16 ) from the galaxy , which we obtained by matching the model to the observations at each redshift .",
    "this work extends and improves such previous study in many ways .",
    "the major novelty is represented by the inclusion of two important features : ( a ) a detailed model to calculate dust mass evolution and the corresponding optical depth to continuum photons enabling us to link @xmath16 to the physical properties of galaxies such as the sfr , imf , age and gas mass ; ( b ) the ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosities produced by cooling of collisionally excited in the galaxy ism .",
    "the latter point is very interesting since most of the studies on laes have focused on stars as the main source of both ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosity ; an exception is dijkstra ( 2009 ) , in which the case of ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosity coming from cooling of collisionally excited in the ism alone has been explored .",
    "cooling of becomes even more important when one considers that ly@xmath0 blobs ( labs ) are powered either by an inflow of cooling gas ( dijkstra & loeb 2009 ) or by supernovae ( mori , umemura & ferrara 2004 ; mori & umemura 2007 ) .    an additional motivation of this paper is to understand how laes become progressively more dusty and how their dust component affects their visibility along with their observed ly@xmath0 and uv continuum lfs , and line equivalent widths ; in addition , gas emission might also have important effects on these quantities which need to be determined .",
    "the study is based on high resolution numerical simulations which enable us to study these effects accurately and on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis .",
    "we use state - of - the - art cosmological sph simulations , the details of which can be found in dayal et al .",
    "( 2009a ) . in brief",
    ", simulations of a cosmic size ( @xmath17 comoving mpc ) , have been carried out using a treepm - sph code gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) with the implementation of chemodynamics as described in tornatore et al .",
    "the run assumes a metallicity - dependent radiative cooling ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) and a uniform redshift - dependent ultra violet background ( uvb ) produced by quasars and galaxies as given by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "the code also includes an effective model to describe star formation from a multi - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) and a prescription for galactic winds triggered by supernova ( sn ) explosions , springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) . in their model",
    ", star formation occurs due to collapse of condensed clouds embedded in an ambient hot gas .",
    "stars with mass larger then 8@xmath18 explode as supernovae and inject energy back into the ism .",
    "these interlinked processes of star formation , cloud evaporation due to supernovae and cloud growth caused by cooling lead to self - regulated star formation . the relative number of stars of different mass is computed for this simulation by assuming the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf between 1 and 100@xmath18 .",
    "metals are produced by snii , snia and intermediate and low - mass stars in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "metals and energy are released by stars of different masses by properly accounting for mass  dependent lifetimes as proposed by padovani & matteucci ( 1993 ) .",
    "we adopt the metallicity  dependent stellar yields from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and the yields for agb and snia from van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) .",
    "galaxies are recognized as gravitationally bound groups of star particles by running a standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm , decomposing each fof group into a set of disjoint substructures and identifying these by the subfind algorithm ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) . after performing a gravitational unbinding procedure , only sub - halos with at least 20 bound particles",
    "are considered to be genuine structures , saro et al .",
    "for each `` bona - fide '' galaxy in the simulation snapshot , we compute the mass - weighted age , the total halo / stellar / gas mass , the sfr , the mass weighted gas / stellar metallicity , the mass - weighted gas temperature and the half mass radius of the dark matter halo .",
    "we compute the intrinsic and observed values of the ly@xmath0/continuum luminosity for all the structures identified as galaxies in the simulation boxes at the redshifts of interest ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "of these , galaxies with an observed ly@xmath0 luminosity , @xmath20 and observed equivalent width , @xmath21  relative to continuum photons , all galaxies are classified as laes based on the ew criterion . ]",
    "are identified as laes , following the current observational criterion for lae identification .",
    "the adopted cosmological model for this work corresponds to the @xmath22cdm universe with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 and @xmath27 , thus consistent with the 5-year analysis of the wmap data ( komatsu et al .",
    "as mentioned before , the huge amount of literature on laes has generally been focused on stars as the main source of both ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosity . however , by virtue of using our sph simulation , we can consistently calculate the separate stellar and cooling gas contributions to the total ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosities , as discussed in the following subsections .",
    "star formation produces photons with energies @xmath28  ryd , which ionize the in the ism . due to the high density of the ism ,",
    "recombinations take place on a short time scale and this produces ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "we represent this luminosity as @xmath29 , or as the ly@xmath0 produced due to stars , which is calculated as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the production rate of ionizing photons , @xmath32 is the fraction of these ionizing photons which escape the galaxy without causing any ionizations , @xmath33 is the planck constant and @xmath34 is the frequency of the ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "the factor of two - thirds arises assuming hydrogen case b recombination ( osterbrock 1989 ) and we use @xmath35 , following the results of gnedin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the continuum luminosity ( @xmath36 ) associated with star formation and @xmath31 are both obtained from starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) , using the stellar metallicity ( @xmath37 ) , age ( @xmath38 ) , imf and the sfr ( @xmath39 ) for each galaxy as obtained from the simulation .",
    "the use of the constant sfr is justified by the fact that all the galaxies identified as laes , at both the redshifts considered , have mass - weighted ages between 30 - 300 myr , which implies that recent star formation does not contribute significantly to the star powered ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosity .    as a quantitative illustration , for a galaxy with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ,",
    "we find @xmath43 and the corresponding stellar ly@xmath0 luminosity for @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "for the same galaxy , the stellar continuum luminosity is @xmath46 , which yields a stellar ew of about @xmath47  .",
    "complete details of this calculation can be found in dayal et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009a ) .",
    "in addition to the formation of stars , our numerical simulations allow us to precisely track the evolution of the amount of gas present in each galaxy of the studied cosmic volume along with its temperature distribution .",
    "the cooling of collisionally excited in the ism of laes gives rise to both ly@xmath0 and uv continuum luminosities that add to those powered by stars .",
    "the ly@xmath0 luminosity , @xmath48 [ erg @xmath49 , produced by the cooling of neutral hydrogen gas of total mass @xmath50 , depends both on the number density of electrons and the number density of .",
    "we assume the hydrogen gas in each galaxy to be concentrated within a radius @xmath51 , such that @xmath52 , where the spin parameter , @xmath53 ( ferrara , pettini & shchekinov 2000 ) and @xmath54 is calculated assuming the collapsed region has an overdensity of 200 times the critical density at the redshift considered . then , the density of electrons can be expressed as @xmath55^{-1}$ ] and the number density of can be expressed as @xmath56^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath57 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath58 is the proton mass . then using the coefficients of @xmath59 $ ] as given by dijkstra ( 2009 ) ,",
    "the total ly@xmath0 luminosity from cooling of collisionally excited from the entire volume in which gas is distributed can be expressed as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a nondimensional function depending on the temperature , @xmath62 , and the fraction of neutral hydrogen , @xmath63 .",
    "further , @xmath64 is the mass fraction mass found in the @xmath65-th bin of the simulated temperature distribution , which is discretized into @xmath66 bins equally spaced in logarithm between @xmath67  k and @xmath68  k , to provide a smooth representation of @xmath69 .",
    "the value of the fraction ( @xmath70 ) in each bin is calculated by inserting the temperature ( @xmath71 ) of that bin into the collisional ionization - recombination rate equation for ( cen 1992 ) .",
    "each galaxy in the simulation box is first assigned to one of the five halo mass ranges shown in tab .",
    "[ temp_dist ] .",
    "then we add its gas mass to the corresponding temperature bin and weigh over the total mass in that mass range .",
    "the values of @xmath72 and galaxy - averaged temperature distributions are shown in tab .",
    "[ temp_dist ] and fig .",
    "[ temp ] , respectively . from the figure",
    ", it appears that massive galaxies tend to have a larger fraction of their interstellar gas in a hot component . in eq .",
    "[ rat ] , @xmath50 is the total mass of the galaxy assuming a primordial gas composition ( 76% h , 24% he ) .",
    ".values of the functions @xmath72 , @xmath73 and the corresponding intrinsic ew from cooling of collisionally excited gas in the ism for different halo mass ranges . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as mentioned before , cooling of collisionally excited can produce a significant amount of ly@xmath0 luminosity in the ism .",
    "however , since galaxies become more compact and denser towards high redshift , this leads to a corresponding increase in @xmath48 .",
    "this can be clearly seen from the cumulative ly@xmath0 lf ( fig .",
    "[ lya ] ) where ignoring the gas contribution leads to a slightly larger under estimation of the lf at @xmath74 compared to @xmath75 .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ lyag ] , cooling of collisionally excited does not contribute much to the continuum luminosity , with the average contribution to the total continuum luminosity being @xmath76 % at either of the redshifts considered .",
    "adding @xmath77 , therefore , produces a negligible effect on the uv lf , as seen clearly from fig .",
    "[ uv ] , where the uv lfs , both including and excluding the gas contribution overlap .",
    "the free parameters in this work are the the radius of the dust distribution , @xmath78 relative to the stellar distribution radius , @xmath79 and the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons relative to continuum photons .",
    "once that these two parameters are obtained by calibrating our results to the uv and ly@xmath0 lfs , we have no more free parameters left . using the values of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and the intrinsic ew for each galaxy we identify as a lae",
    ", we obtain the emergent and observed ews at @xmath8 . due to the cooling of collisionally excited , the total ly@xmath0 luminosity increases by a factor of about 1.12",
    "while the continuum almost remains unchanged .",
    "this leads to intrinsic ews in the range 88.8 - 188.8  for the galaxies we identify as laes .",
    "the average value of the intrinsic ew at @xmath8 also increases to 106.0  compared to 95  that we found in dayal et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , not including gas emission .",
    "the ews emerging from the galaxy at @xmath8 are further enhanced and have a mean value of 157.2  because of the larger escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons with respect to continuum photons ( @xmath82 ) . however , since the ly@xmath0 luminosity is attenuated by transmission through the igm , with @xmath83 , the observed ews are finally reduced to the range 44.4 - 106.9  ; with an average value of 75.1  .",
    "we show the ews as a function of the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity in fig .",
    "[ ewfig57 ] .",
    "though the numerical data is concentrated at @xmath84 , it shows some scatter , mostly induced by the different physical properties of galaxies as age and metallicity .",
    "however , we are unable to reproduce some of the largest and smallest ew values",
    ". this could be due to some of the assumptions made in the modelling of @xmath48 including : ( a ) we have calculated @xmath48 for a homogeneous ism . this assumption seems to represent a fairly good description of the low-@xmath7 data discussed in fig .",
    "4 . however , we can not exclude the possible presence of gas inhomogeneities which would increase the collisional excitation rates and hence increase @xmath48 .",
    "since we are investigating a large cosmological volume , resolving the small scale structure of the ism is beyond the possibilities of the present work , and our results in this sense should be considered as a lower limit to the true emissivity of the gas .",
    "( b ) @xmath48 depends on the radius of gas distribution and the simple relation we have assumed might be different for these high redshift galaxies and ( c ) we have assumed a very simple scaling between @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in reality",
    ", this should depend on the geometry and distribution of dust within the ism and this would induce scatter in the ew distribution .",
    "coupling sph simulations with a ly@xmath0 production / transmission model , in dayal et al .",
    "( 2009a ) we studied the evolution in the properties of ly@xmath0 emitters at high redshifts . in this paper",
    ", we further extend that work by including two important ingredients , based on the intrinsic properties of each galaxy : ( a ) ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosities produced by cooling of collisionally excited with electrons in the ism and ( b ) a dust model to calculate the optical depth and hence , the escape fraction of continuum photons ( and color excess ) from each galaxy .",
    "we find that the ly@xmath0 luminosity from cooling ism gas ( @xmath48 ) constitutes a non - negligible addition to the value from stars ( @xmath29 ) ; the average value of @xmath85 at @xmath86 .",
    "however , the continuum from stellar luminosity ( @xmath36 ) always dominates over that from cooling gas ( @xmath77 ) ; the average value of @xmath87 at @xmath86 .",
    "the contribution of the cooling of to both the ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosities increases with redshift because of the increasing gas density , which leads to a larger excitation and hence , cooling rate .",
    "since the sfr rises steeply with increasing halo mass , @xmath29 and @xmath36 also increase faster as compared to @xmath48 and @xmath77 and hence dominate in massive galaxies .",
    "the dust budget of a given lae is determined by several physical processes ( dust formation , destruction and astration ) mainly regulated by the evolution of massive stars .",
    "hence the dust mass increases with increasing halo mass , following the behavior of the star formation rate .",
    "galaxies with the largest stellar mass , @xmath88 have also the largest dust content , with a scaling relation given by @xmath1",
    ". the same trend of increasing dust content is also observed in terms of the stellar metallicity , @xmath3 .",
    "we calculate the escape fraction of continuum photons using a slab - like dust distribution model and graphite / carbonaceous grains ( radius @xmath89 , density @xmath90 ) .",
    "we then assume a mass - independent relation to go from @xmath16 to @xmath15 such that @xmath91 at @xmath86 respectively .",
    "the increase in the dust mass with increasing halo mass leads to a decrease in the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons ( @xmath15 ) from the galaxy , with the value dropping from @xmath92 to @xmath93 as the halo mass increases from @xmath94 to @xmath95 at @xmath8 .    using a sn dust extinction curve ( todini & ferrara 2001 ) , @xmath96 .",
    "this means that the ism dust is quite homogeneous for @xmath97 ; a situation we find at @xmath74 .",
    "however , no extinction curve can produce the value of @xmath98 , which hints at the fact that the dust could be clumped at @xmath8 as proposed by neufeld ( 1991 ) and hansen & oh ( 2006 ) .    using two free parameters to translate @xmath16 to @xmath15 and @xmath79 to @xmath78 , we are able to reproduce the uv and ly@xmath0 lfs reasonably at both the redshifts considered . with no more free parameters ,",
    "we calculate the intrinsic , emergent and observed ews from the galaxies we identify as laes . adding ly@xmath0 from the cooling , the average intrinsic ew at @xmath75 increases by a factor of about 1.12 and has a mean vale of @xmath99  .",
    "the emergent ew is further enhanced to an average value of about 157.2  at @xmath8 since @xmath82 at this redshift .",
    "however , attenuation of the ly@xmath0 luminosity in the igm reduces the mean observed ew to 75.1  .",
    "the observed ews ( shimasaku et al . 2006 ) show a large scatter when plotted against the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity . by virtue of using a ly@xmath0 production / transmission and dust model that depends on the intrinsic properties of each galaxy ,",
    "we also obtain a scatter in the same plot .",
    "we conclude by discussing some unsolved points still left in our calculations .",
    "though we are able to reproduce the ly@xmath0 lf at @xmath75 to a reasonable extent , we are still unable to capture the shape of the slope completely .",
    "further , though we get a scatter in the ews , we are still unable to produce the largest and smallest ews",
    ". these could be due to the simplifying assumptions adopted in our modelling .",
    "these include : ( a ) a simple scaling relation between the gas distribution scale and the virial radius for each galaxy .",
    "however , a spread in this relation would vary the @xmath48 calculated ; ( b ) assuming a clumpy ism would increase @xmath48 as compared to the value we get assuming a homogeneous distribution ; ( c ) a simple scaling between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note , however , that a relation dependent on the individual ism conditions of each galaxy would induce a scatter in the ew distribution ; ( d ) inflows / outflows , could vary the ews and probably also leave an imprint on the ly@xmath0 lf and ( d ) a detailed radiative transfer model of reionization which could affect our calculation of @xmath81 .",
