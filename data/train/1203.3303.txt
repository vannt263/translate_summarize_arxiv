    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are the result of low - intermediate mass stars ( @xmath1518 @xmath16 ) that have experienced heavy mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "their gaseous envelopes are ionised by hot pre - white dwarfs ( @xmath17@xmath1530140 kk ) whose diverse spectroscopic appearance ( mndez 1991 ) reflects different wind properties and atmospheric compositions . a subset of central stars have h - deficient atmospheres composed primarily of helium , carbon and oxygen with fast and dense winds that produce broad emission lines .",
    "their spectroscopic appearance mimics the carbon - sequence of massive wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and they are classified into either [ wo ] or [ wc ] types , the brackets distinguishing them apart from massive stars ( van der hucht 2001 ) , depending on which emission lines are present and their relative intensities ( crowther , de marco & barlow 1998 ; acker & neiner 2003 ) . despite recent surveys that have dramatically increased the number of central stars that belong to the [ wc ] sequence ( acker & neiner 2003 ; grny et al .",
    "2004 , 2009 , 2010 ; depew et al . 2011 ) , their origin and evolution remain poorly understood .",
    "werner & herwig ( 2006 ) reviewed possible scenarios that may explain the h - deficiency of [ wc ] central stars he - burning . ] and their progeny the pg1159 stars ( wesemael , green & liebert 1985 ) .",
    "after the central star has left the agb phase a late thermal pulse ( ltp ) or very - late thermal pulse ( vltp ) would reignite helium - shell burning ( e.g. blcker 2001 ; herwig 2001 ) .",
    "the star is sent back to the agb phase , i.e. it becomes `` born - again '' ( schnberner 1979 ) , and any residual hydrogen is either burned or diluted below the observable detection limit . the agb final thermal pulse ( aftp ) variant may also be invoked to explain some instances where a small amount of observable hydrogen remains . at this point",
    "the star enters the [ wc]-sequence with an h - deficient atmosphere mostly made of helium ( @xmath153050% ) , carbon ( @xmath153060% ) and oxygen ( @xmath15220% ) .",
    "a post - agb h - deficient evolutionary sequence [ wcl]@xmath14[wce]@xmath14pg1159 has been proposed in which late - type [ wc ] central stars evolve into early - type [ wc ] and [ wo ] central stars , followed by pg1159 stars which appear preferentially in the oldest pne ( napiwotzki & schnberner 1995 ) and in isolation once the surrounding pne have dissipated into the interstellar medium .",
    "unless there is a residual amount of hydrogen the end product will be a non - da white dwarf .",
    "this evolutionary sequence is supported by the strong similarities in derived atmospheric compositions ( werner & herwig 2006 ) and some transition objects ( e.g. bond 2008 ) .",
    "a key question is whether the h - deficiency of all members of the sequence can be explained by the ltp , vltp and aftp scenarios .",
    "grny & tylenda ( 2000 ) found the evolutionary status of nebulae surrounding h - deficient central stars to be consistent with h - rich central stars , rather than following the paths predicted by ltp or vltp scenarios .",
    "it is therefore debatable whether the few documented ltp and vltp events ( schnberner 2008 ) mandate the same origin for the larger population of h - deficient central stars .",
    "indeed , there may even be an alternative common - envelope ( de marco & soker 2002 ; de marco 2008 ; hajduk , zijlstra & gesicki 2010 ) or nova - like explanation for such objects ( wesson , liu & barlow 2003 ; wesson et al .",
    "2008 ; lau , de marco & liu 2011 ) .    even more difficult to explain are the helium - rich h - deficient stars which do not fit the carbon - rich post - agb h - deficient sequence .",
    "these include four o(he ) stars ( rauch et al .",
    "1998 ) , two of which are central stars of pne ( rauch et al . 1994 , 1996 ) , r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars ( clayton 1996 ) , extreme helium b stars and helium - rich subdwarf o stars ( see e.g. werner & herwig 2006 ) . with typical helium mass fractions",
    "@xmath1890% and trace amounts of other elements the chemical compositions of these stars have never been predicted by the born - again scenarios , i.e. they simply should not exist ! on the whole",
    "these stars are scarce compared to the carbon - rich sequence and probably form a second , parallel post - agb h - deficient sequence .",
    "evidence for such a sequence is tentative however , based primarily on their common composition rather than other evolutionary ties .",
    "it has been suggested that rcb stars are the progenitors of o(he ) stars , although the circumstances of this possible connection remain unclear .",
    "after the discovery of a low @xmath19o/@xmath20o ratio by clayton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) strongly pointing to a merger origin for rcb stars , an end to the protracted debate on the formation of rcb stars seemed to be in sight . however , not only is the rcb evolutionary path complicated by a connection with [ wc ] central stars ( clayton & de marco 1997 ; clayton et al . 2006 ; clayton et al .",
    "2011a ) , but there are indications of a mixed origin within the rcb class itself ( clayton et al .",
    "2011b ) .    it is imperative that more members of the he - rich / h - deficient class are found and studied to establish a second evolutionary sequence .",
    "if this can be achieved , then there should exist another mechanism responsible for h - deficiency , one which may also help explain the origin of the carbon - rich sequence .",
    "a long sought after solution may be [ wn ] type wr central stars that mimic the helium- and nitrogen - rich wn sequence in massive stars ( smith , shara & moffat 1996 ) .",
    "although some candidates have been proposed , none have turned out to be satisfactory and the existence of the class remains unproven .",
    "here we report on the serendipitous discovery of a [ wn ] central star in the pn ic  4663 ( pn g346.2@xmath008.2 , fleming & pickering 1910 ) .",
    "observations of ic  4663 were made during the gemini south programme gs-2011a - q-65 ( pi : b. miszalski ) which aimed to discover new close binary central stars of pne via radial velocity variability ( e.g. miszalski et al .",

    "around 8% of massive galactic wn stars are known to have surrounding nebulae ( stock & barlow 2010 ) . until improved observations",
    "could reliably determine the luminosity of their central stars , some of these nebulae were misclassified as pne .",
    "as the distances to pne are extremely difficult to estimate this has not helped clarify the status of many candidates .",

    "we have discovered the first bona - fide [ wn ] central star of a pn in ic  4663 .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * the gemini south gmos spectrum of the central star is dominated by broad he  ii and n  v emission lines , that together with the notable absence of he  i and c  iv , corresponds to a [ wn3 ] subtype . * a cmfgen nlte model atmosphere of the central star was built and reasonably reproduces the gmos spectrum .",
    "the central star has a very hot ( @xmath76 kk ) and fast ( @xmath77 km s@xmath5 ) stellar wind .",
    "the atmosphere consists of helium ( 95% ) , hydrogen ( @xmath13% ) , nitrogen ( 0.8% ) , neon ( 0.2% ) and oxygen ( 0.05% ) by mass .",
    "such a composition can not be explained by extant scenarios that seek to explain the h - deficiency of post - agb stars . *",
    "the helium - rich atmospheric composition strongly links [ wn ] central stars to the o(he ) central stars ( rauch et al .",
    "the data support a second post - agb h - deficient evolutionary sequence [ wn]@xmath14o(he ) parallel to the established carbon - rich [ wcl]@xmath14[wce]@xmath14pg1159 sequence .",
    "connections to other he - rich / h - deficient stars may include rcb stars , and if there were a binary companion to the [ wn3 ] star , am cvn stars and he - rich novae after further angular momentum loss .",
    "the existence of this second sequence strongly suggests another mechanism exists for producing h - deficient post - agb stars besides the various born - again scenarios .",
    "* for all reasonable distances the luminosity of the central star is 46 mag fainter than massive wn3 stars ( crowther et al .",
    "1995b ) . at our assumed distance of 3.5 kpc ( ssv08 ) ,",
    "the derived luminosity is log @xmath78 , the stellar radius @xmath11 @xmath12 and the mass loss rate @xmath79 @xmath16 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the transformed radius , @xmath80 , of 13.4 @xmath12 for ic  4663 is comparable to massive wn3 stars , indicating a similar stellar wind density to its massive counterparts .",
    "this favours our morphological [ wn3 ] classification of the central star of ic  4663 , rather than alternative weak wind ( of or of - wr ) classifications ( mndez et al .",
    "1990 ; mndez 1991 ) . *",
    "the surrounding nebula is a bona - fide pn .",
    "the elliptical main nebula has a relatively low expansion velocity of 30 km s@xmath5 and is surrounded by a newly discovered agb halo .",
    "the evolutionary status of the highly ionised nebula corresponds to that of similar nebulae around [ wo ] type central stars and supports the [ wn]@xmath14o(he ) evolutionary sequence .",
    "* chemical abundances of the nebula were derived from a combination of _ iue _ , gmos and ccm10 emission line intensities .",
    "the abundance pattern is approximately solar with slight enhancements for helium , nitrogen and neon .",
    "the carbon to oxygen ratio is lower than in the sun , however the data are insufficient to prove a carbon underabundance .",
    "* we found no evidence for rv variability from the central star @xmath18510 km s@xmath5 in three epochs .",
    "further monitoring of the central star should be performed to conclusively rule out the presence of a companion to the [ wn3 ] central star .",
    "we acknowledge the conscientious and helpful support of michelle edwards , henry lee and andrew gosling during the course of our gemini programme .",
    "we thank sawomir grny for valuable help in calculating @xmath81 and @xmath82 and joanna mikoajewska for discussions on symbiotic novae .",
    "afjm is grateful to nserc ( canada ) and fqrnt ( quebec ) for financial assistance .",
    "this work was primarily based on observations obtained at the gemini observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under a cooperative agreement with the nsf on behalf of the gemini partnership : the national science foundation ( united states ) , the science and technology facilities council ( united kingdom ) , the national research council ( canada ) , conicyt ( chile ) , the australian research council ( australia ) , ministrio da cincia e tecnologia ( brazil ) and ministerio de ciencia , tecnologa e innovacin productiva ( argentina ) .",
