    "one of the most difficult problems in field theory is the calculation of bound states due to the fact that they necessarily involve an infinite number of diagrams .",
    "a promising approach to deal with this problem is light - front dynamics ( lfd ) . in its standard version @xcite",
    ", the state vector is defined on the surface @xmath8 .",
    "the bound states in the yukawa model ( two fermions interacting by scalar exchange ) were studied in references @xcite using tamm - dancoff method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was found in particular that , because the dominating kernel at large momenta tends to a constant , the binding energy of the @xmath9 state is cutoff dependent , what requires the renormalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the two - fermion wave functions were also considered in the explicitly covariant version of lfd ( clfd ) @xcite . in this formalism , proposed in @xcite , the state vector is defined on the plane given by the invariant equation @xmath10{$\\cdot$}}x=0 $ ] with @xmath11 .",
    "this approach keeps all along explicitly the dependence of the amplitudes on the light - front normal @xmath12 and presents some advantages , in particular when calculating form factors @xcite and when constructing non zero angular momentum states @xcite . a first attempt to deal with clfd wave functions",
    "was done in @xcite where deuteron and @xmath13 scattering @xmath14 state were calculated perturbatively and successfully applied to deuteron e.m .",
    "form factors @xcite measured at tjnaf @xcite .",
    "the clfd equations have now been solved exactly for a two - fermion system in the ladder approximation with different boson exchange couplings @xcite .",
    "the first results for the yukawa model have been reported in @xcite .",
    "we investigated with special interest the stability of the bound state solutions relative to the cutoff , disregarding the self energy contribution and renormalization .",
    "we have found a critical phenomenon for the cutoff dependence of the binding energy .",
    "the @xmath9 solutions were found to be stable ",
    "i.e. with finite limit when the cutoff tends to infinity  for coupling constant @xmath15 below a critical value @xmath7 . on the contrary , for values exceeding @xmath7 , the system collapses .",
    "this fact manifests itself either as an infinite number of bound states with unbounded energies going to @xmath16 for a finite value of the coupling constant or as a zero value of the coupling constant for a fixed value of the binding energy .",
    "the present paper is a detailed version of our work @xcite , includes new findings concerning the calculation of the critical coupling constant and the asymptotical behavior of the wave functions and the full treatment of the @xmath17 state .",
    "our results are compared to those obtained in @xcite .    in section [ covwf ]",
    "we remind the general properties of the two - fermion equations and wave functions in clfd , already presented in @xcite . in sections",
    "[ j0 ] and [ j1 ] the system of equations for the @xmath14 and @xmath18 wave function components are derived .",
    "we show in section [ relgl ] that , after a linear transformation of these components and a change of variables , the clfd equations are identical to the ones considered in @xcite . in section [ asympt ] we analyze analytically the asymptotical properties of the kernels and wave functions and their relation with the existence of a critical coupling constant .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ num ] and section [ concl ] contains the concluding remarks .",
    "we briefly describe here the main properties of the clfd wave functions and equations . a detailed derivation can be found in @xcite .    in the covariant version of lfd the wave functions are the fock components of the state vector defined on the light - front plane @xmath10{$\\cdot$}}x=0 $ ] .",
    "the standard lfd approach is recovered as a particular case with @xmath19 .",
    "the wave function @xmath20 of a two - fermion bound state is shown graphically in figure [ fwf ] .",
    "it depends on four four - momenta @xmath21 which are all on the corresponding mass shells ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and satisfy the conservation law : @xmath25    in the standard approach the @xmath26 and @xmath27 components are conserved , whereas the minus - component is not .",
    "these properties are reproduced by equation ( [ kcl ] ) , since in this case the only nonzero component is @xmath28 .",
    "equation ( [ kcl ] ) is thus a covariant generalization of the usual conservation law .",
    "the general form of the wave function ( [ wf1 ] ) depends on the particular quantum number of the state and is obtained by constructing all possible spin structures .",
    "it is convenient to introduce variables ( @xmath29 ) , constructed from the initial four - momenta as follows : @xmath30{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{{\\cal p}}}{\\sqrt{{\\cal p}^2}+{\\cal p}_0 } ]            \\nonumber \\\\\\label{sc4 }    \\hat{n}&= & { l^{-1}({\\cal p})\\vec{\\omega}\\over|l^{-1}({\\cal p})\\vec{\\omega}|}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the lorentz boost into the reference system where @xmath33 . in these variables , the wave function ( [ wf1 ] )",
    "is represented as : @xmath34 under lorentz transformations of the four - momenta @xmath35 the variables @xmath36 are only rotated @xcite , so that parametrization ( [ wf3 ] ) , though being three - dimensional , is also explicitly covariant . in practice , instead of dealing with transformations ( [ sc4 ] ) , it is enough to write the wave functions and dynamical equations in the center of mass reference system , i.e. the one for which @xmath37 and in which @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the equation for the wave function in terms of variables ( [ sc4 ] ) reads : @xmath41{\\mit\\phi}_{\\sigma_2\\sigma_1}(\\vec{k},\\vec{n})= \\frac{m^2}{2\\pi^3 } \\int \\sum_{\\sigma'_1\\sigma'_2 } k_{\\sigma_2\\sigma_1}^{\\sigma'_2\\sigma'_1}(\\vec{k},\\vec{k}\\,',\\hat{n},m^2 ) { \\mit \\phi}_{\\sigma'_2\\sigma'_1}(\\vec{k}\\,',\\hat{n } ) \\frac{d^3k'}{\\varepsilon_{k'}}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the interaction kernel .",
    "it depends on the scalar products of the vectors @xmath43 and also on the scalar products @xmath44{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{\\sigma}$ ] , @xmath45{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{\\sigma}$ ] and @xmath46{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{\\sigma}$ ] . for the yukawa model it will be precised in next section .    in clfd",
    ", the construction of states with definite angular momentum has some peculiarities which are explained in @xcite .",
    "these peculiarities are related to the fact that the angular momentum operator @xmath47 is not kinematical , but contains the interaction .",
    "however , we can overcome this difficulty by taking into account the so - called angular condition , derived from the transformation properties of the wave function under rotations of the light - front plane .",
    "assuming that the state vector satisfies this condition , the problem results in finding the eigenfunctions of a purely kinematical operator @xmath48    @xmath49    where @xmath50 are the fermion spin operators .",
    "the operators ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) have the same eigenvalues @xmath53 and @xmath54 than the full angular momentum operators ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , in any lorentz transformation of the state vector , @xmath57 and @xmath58 undergo only rotations , with the same rotation operator than the one acting on spinor indices @xmath59 . in this respect ,",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath60 are constructed as in the non relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the only difference is that we have at our disposal two three - dimensional vectors ( @xmath29 ) which enter in this construction on equal ground , instead of the only relative momentum @xmath57 in the non relativistic case .",
    "since the interaction kernel in ( [ eq5d ] ) depends on the scalar products of all the three - vectors , including spin operator , @xmath48 commutes with it .",
    "the solutions of the equation ( [ eq5d ] ) are eigenfunctions of the operators @xmath61 with eigenvalues @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "although the operator @xmath48 contains the derivatives both over @xmath62 and @xmath63 , its projection on @xmath58-axis does not involve any derivative with respect to variable @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore this latter enters in equation ( [ eq5d ] ) as a vector parameter only and not as a dynamical variable .",
    "therefore , there exists another operator which commutes with the kernel , namely : @xmath64{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{m})^2.\\ ] ] since @xmath65 is a scalar , it commutes also with @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , in addition to @xmath66 , the solutions are labeled by @xmath67 : @xmath68 the operator @xmath65 has @xmath69 eigenvalues , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 eigenfunctions which are split in two families of @xmath72 and @xmath69 states with opposite parities . for @xmath73 , there is only one value @xmath74 . for @xmath75 , there are two values @xmath74 and @xmath76 . the wave function with definite @xmath72",
    "is determined by @xmath77 spin components ( the @xmath78 factor comes from parity conservation ) .",
    "the system of equations for these @xmath79 spin components is split in different subsystems each of them with definite value of @xmath67 .",
    "for example , the wave function for @xmath80 is determined by @xmath81 components @xcite and the equation system is split in two subsystems corresponding to @xmath74 and @xmath76 and containing respectively 2 and 4 equations ( see section [ j1 ] ) .",
    "the calculation technique of the clfd is given by special graph rules which are a covariant generalization of the old fashioned perturbation theory .",
    "it was developed by kadyshevsky @xcite and adapted to clfd in @xcite .",
    "the equation for the wave function is shown graphically in figure [ feq ] and the corresponding analytical form ( [ eq5d ] ) is obtained by applying the rules of the graph techniques to the diagram displayed in this figure .    all along this paper",
    "we will consider the one boson exchange kernel with scalar coupling only .",
    "the interaction lagrangian is @xmath82 .",
