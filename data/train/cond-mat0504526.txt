    "the pattern formation in nonequilibrium processes is a longstanding problem in statistical physics @xcite . in special , the diffusion - limited aggregation model ( dla )",
    "@xcite is a noteworthy example in which a very simple algorithm generates disorderly fractal clusters .",
    "this model was related to several physical and biological applications , such as electrodeposition @xcite , viscous fingering @xcite , bacterial colonies @xcite , and neurite formation @xcite . in dla model , particles released at a point distant from the cluster",
    "execute random walks until they find a neighbor site of the cluster and irreversible stick in this site .",
    "if the random walks are replaced by ballistic trajectories at random directions , we have the ballistic aggregation ( ba ) model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to dla , the ba model generates disordered nonfractal clusters with nontrivial scaling properties @xcite .    due to its importance as a fundamental model ,",
    "several generalizations of dla model were proposed @xcite . in particular ,",
    "those models in which the particle trajectories are biased random walks were investigated @xcite . in these models ,",
    "on the short length scales the particle trajectories are common random walks with fractal dimension 2.0 , whereas on the longer length scales the bias becomes dominant and the dimensionality of the walk is 1.0 .",
    "clusters grown using this type of walk must behave like dla model on the short length scales , while nonfractal patterns are observed on the longer ones . consequently , the mass of a cluster of size @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 in which @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the space dimension , @xmath21 is the dla fractal dimension , and @xmath22 is the crossover radius from dla- to ba - like scaling regimes .",
    "this idea was firstly considered by meakin @xcite . in his model ,",
    "the simulations start with a single seed at the center of a square lattice and the drift of all trajectories is in a fixed lattice direction . along the walk , the particle is moved one lattice unity in the drift direction with probability @xmath23 , or moves to one of its four next - neighbor sites with probability @xmath24 .",
    "the model generates patterns with a growth tendency in the opposite direction of the drift .",
    "the author argues that the crossover from the dla - like structure on the short length scales to a compact structure on the longer ones is characterized by a length @xmath25 .",
    "however , using a renormalization group approach , nagatani found @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied lattice models with a global drift to the seed , in which the particles have a higher probability to move to the nearest neighbor representing the shortest distance away from the seed .",
    "the pattern morphologies are ruled by the lattice anisotropy and their fractal dimension is 1 .",
    "nagatani @xcite considered the effects of positive and negative radial drifts in dla model . in the positive case",
    "the cluster fractal dimension is asymptotically 2 , while eccentric patterns with dimension 1 were found for the negative case .",
    "other models @xcite consist of the deposition processes on a @xmath20-dimensional substrate in which the walk drift is the substrate direction .    in the present paper , we are interested in the transition from dla to ba models when the random or ballistic trajectories of dla and ba models , respectively , are replaced by biased random walks with a random drift direction .",
    "the central concern of this work is the fact that all real fractals exhibit scaling only on limited ranges and , consequently , a quantitative analysis of both experiments and simulations demands a deep understanding of these crossovers .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ models ] , the model and the respective computational algorithm are described . in sec .",

    "as in the original dla and ba models , at the beginning of the simulations a unique seed localized in the center of the lattice constitutes the cluster .",
    "then , particles are sequentially released at a circle distant from the cluster and execute biased random walks . the distance between the center of the lattice and the launching circle",
    "is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the biased walks are defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the particle coordinates at the n@xmath31 step of the walk , @xmath32 is a random angle that defines the bias direction , @xmath33 $ ] is the parameter that controls the random component of the trajectories , and @xmath34 is a random direction .",

    "notice that @xmath32 is defined at the beginning of the walks , whereas @xmath34 assumes random values for each walk step .",
    "one can see that the particular cases @xmath1 and @xmath36 recover the ba and dla models , respectively .",
    "if the particle visits a site neighboring the cluster it irreversibly joins to this site . however , if the distance between the particle and the cluster is too large , i. e. , larger than a killing radius @xmath37 , the particle is excluded and a new one is released at the launching circle . in order to determine when a walker is neighboring a cluster site , its lattice position was defined as the next integer value of its real coordinates defined by eq .",

    "the majority of the results presented in this work refer to the square lattice version of the model",
    ".    the previously introduced variables ( @xmath27 and @xmath37 ) must be as large as possible . however , computational limitations restrict the use of @xmath27 and @xmath37 values .",

    "the killing radius @xmath37 must be @xmath43 to @xmath44 times @xmath39 for very large dla clusters @xcite whereas a @xmath37 only some lattice units larger than @xmath39 is necessary for the ba model . due to the bias present in",

    "[ modeldba ] illustrates two tentatives , one successful and the other frustrated , to add a new particle to the cluster .    to analyze the transition between ba and dla it is necessary to simulate large clusters using lattices containing up to @xmath46 sites , specially when @xmath47",
    "consequently , the computational time becomes prohibitive and an efficient algorithm is necessary .",
    "a technique commonly used to simulate large dla and related models is to allow the particles execute long steps at random directions if they are far from the cluster @xcite .",
    "this procedure is correct because the probability of a random walker crosses the circle centered on its initial position in a given angle @xmath48 is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "however , for the biased random walkers this is not true .",
    "indeed , the probability density distributions are concentrated around the direction @xmath32 . for @xmath0",

    "it is worth to note that the gaussian distribution is not normalized in the interval @xmath35 $ ] and , obviously , this is not the actual angle distribution for the present problem .",

    "nevertheless , the approach to the constant density is very slow and takes a scale invariant form @xmath77 here , @xmath78 is a correction to the fractal dimension and @xmath79 a constant .",
    "this scaling hypothesis was also used by liang and kadanoff @xcite to study the driven ballistic aggregation , in which the particles trajectories are in a single direction .",
