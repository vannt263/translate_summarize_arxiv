    "micromechanical resonators coupled to cold atoms have recently attracted much interest as a promising class of hybrid quantum systems @xcite . on the one hand , advances in nanoscale fabrication techniques have led to the development of high - quality micromechanical resonators in various forms , driven in particular by the interest in preparing quantum states of macroscopic devices @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of these resonators is that they may be functionalized by attaching additional elements , which enables optical , magnetic , or charge - based coupling to other systems @xcite .",
    "many such devices are optimized for the interaction with light in cavity - optomechanical setups @xcite , which , e.g. , enable optomechanical laser cooling @xcite of the mechanical resonator to its ground state @xcite .",

    "these efforts have also enabled an atomic realization of optomechanics @xcite .    in light of these developments ,",
    "a combination of mechanical and atomic systems promises new ways to control and manipulate the mechanical resonator via the atoms , but may also lead to novel ways of realizing interesting atomic dynamics . along these lines ,",
    "direct @xcite and optical @xcite coupling schemes between atoms and micromechanical systems have been proposed , and first experiments have been realized @xcite .",
    "many of these setups pose great experimental challenges as they require the combination of a functionalized mechanical resonator with atomic trapping and manipulation techniques within the same vacuum chamber or cryostat and , possibly , within the same optical cavity .",
    "a modular setup that circumvents the need for integration of atoms and mechanics within the same vacuum chamber has recently been proposed @xcite and later realized @xcite by some of the authors .",
    "the experiment demonstrates a light - mediated coherent coupling of the vibrations of a micromechanical membrane to the center - of - mass motion of an atomic ensemble , which is kept at a distance ( @xmath0  m in the experiment @xcite ) in a separate vacuum chamber .",
    "motivated by these experimental developments , we analyze in this work a more sophisticated setup as displayed in fig.[fig : setup](a ) . here , the membrane is enclosed in an optical cavity , as in the standard ` membrane - in - the - middle ' configuration @xcite , while the atoms are trapped _",
    "outside _ of the cavity in the optical lattice potential provided by the light field reflected off the cavity . adding the cavity preserves the modularity , while the coherent coupling between the two systems is enhanced by the cavity finesse in addition to a collective enhancement by the square root of the number of atoms .",
    "as we will show , the coupling strength can be leveraged so as to exceed the various decoherence rates .",
    "first of all , this coherent coupling enables a resonant exchange of excitations between the two systems .",
    "furthermore , one can switch on laser cooling of the atomic motion @xcite , thereby effectively tailoring the dissipation of the membrane .",
    "this leads to a sympathetic cooling scheme for the membrane which is analogous to standard optomechanical cavity cooling @xcite , with the role of the cavity played by the atoms .",
    "however , in addition to being tunable , our scheme does not require the cavity linewidth to be much less than the mechanical frequency and thus relaxes the experimental requirements on the cavity .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a rigorous , quantum mechanical treatment of the proposed setup .",
    "in addition to deriving the exact form of the coherent coupling , this also yields a consistent description of quantum noise in the problem such that we are able to describe the dynamics of the system on the level of a few quanta .",
    "in particular , we analyze the possibility of observing quantum coherent excitation exchange between the two systems , and address the question whether the membrane can be cooled to its quantum mechanical ground state by laser cooling the atoms .",
    "our results allow us to identify optimal experimental parameters for both scenarios .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in sec.[sec : quantummodel ] , we first give a simple semi - classical estimate for the coupling , and then present a full quantum model of the problem from which we obtain a linearized interaction of atoms and membrane with the light field . section [ sec : effdyn ] then deals with eliminating the light field to obtain an effective description of atoms and membrane alone , which includes the dominant sources of decoherence .",
    "the resulting effective dynamics is subsequently discussed in sec.[sec : discussion ] , where we analyze the scenarios of coherent dynamics ( sec.[sec : cohdyn ] ) and sympathetic cooling of the membrane ( sec.[sec : sympcool ] ) .",
    "finally , sec.[sec : exprel ] comments on the experimental realization of our proposal , and concluding remarks can be found in sec.[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a system as shown in fig.[fig : setup](a ) , where a mechanical resonator residing in a single - sided cavity of finesse @xmath1 is coupled to the motion of a distant atomic ensemble _ outside _ the cavity . before discussing our full quantum model below ,",
    "we present a brief estimate of the expected coupling based on a quasi - static picture : the membrane is taken to be a standard sin membrane with a resonance at frequency @xmath2 and effective mass @xmath3 , such that its zero point motion is given by @xmath4 .",
    "its coupling to the atoms is mediated by a laser beam of wavelength @xmath5 , which is reflected off the cavity and forms an optical lattice for the atoms by means of the dipole force @xcite .",
    "we assume the lattice to be deep enough to treat its wells as independent harmonic traps of frequency @xmath6 .",
    "if the laser is resonant with the cavity , then a displacement of the membrane by an amplitude @xmath7 corresponding to its zero point motion leads to a phase - shift @xmath8 of the reflected light . for a single atom , the resulting shift of the standing wave pattern outside the cavity would lead to a force @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass of one atom and",
    "@xmath11 the wavenumber of the laser .",
    "however , since all atoms are affected equally the membrane couples to the center - of - mass motion of the atoms , which , on a single quantum level , leads to a collectively enhanced coupling rate of the form @xcite @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the number of atoms and @xmath14 is the atomic zero point motion .",
    "this estimate shows that the small mass ratio @xmath15 can be compensated by both a large atom number and a high finesse . in reverse ,",
    "if the atoms depart from their equilibrium positions , then their restoring force originates from redistribution of photons between the right- and left - propagating components of the standing wave . as a result , the intensity inside the cavity changes and thus the radiation pressure on the membrane such that it experiences a force .",
    "the quantum model presented in the following will confirm the above estimate .",
    "we describe our setup by a one - dimensional ( 1d ) model with hamiltonian @xmath16 here , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 describe the free evolution of the mechanics , the external atomic degrees of freedom , and the field modes , respectively .",
    "further , @xmath20 represents the coupling between the mechanical oscillator and the field modes , and @xmath21 the interaction between atoms and field modes . the last term in eq .",
    "summarizes decoherence effects , which will be introduced explicitly in sec.[sec : decoherence ] .    the first term in eq .",
    "describes the harmonic vibrations of the mechanical resonator and reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the position , momentum and annihilation operators , respectively . the second term in eq .",
    "is given by @xmath26 and represents the kinetic energy of the atoms , where the @xmath27 are the momenta of the individual atoms .",
    "the free field hamiltonian reads @xmath28 , where the mode operators obey the commutation relation @xmath29=\\delta({\\omega}-{\\omega}')$ ] , and all frequency integrals are understood to run over a bandwidth @xmath30 around the laser frequency @xmath31 introduced below . in the spirit of a ` modes of the universe '",
    "approach we take care of the cavity by explicitly including it in the mode functions @xmath32 , which are associated with the @xmath33 and defined by writing the positive frequency parts of the fields as @xcite @xmath34 here , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the cross sectional area of the modes . in the following",
    "we discuss the particular case of a ` membrane - in - the - middle ' setup @xcite based on a single - sided cavity , as shown in fig.[fig : setup](a ) .",
    "however , other arrangements can be treated analogously by using the appropriate mode functions .",
    "this is shown explicitly in appendix [ app : mirror ] for a setup with a movable end mirror instead of the membrane .",
    "we model the membrane and the semi - transparent end mirror of the cavity by dielectric slabs at positions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively @xcite .",

    "finally , @xmath21 in eq . describes the dipole interaction of the atoms with the light field .",
    "we model the atoms as two - level systems of transition frequency @xmath60 , from which the frequency @xmath61 of the trapping laser is far detuned by @xmath62 ( see inset in fig.[fig : setup](a ) ) .",
    "we further anticipate that all relevant field modes will lie within a bandwidth @xmath63 around the laser frequency , such that we can eliminate the upper level of the atoms and describe the atom - field interaction by an ac - stark shift for atoms in the ground state @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the atomic dipole moment and the @xmath66 are the positions of the atoms .",
    "we now introduce the laser displayed in fig.[fig : setup](a ) , which provides the optical lattice for the atoms and mediates the coupling between the atoms and the mechanical resonator .",
    "to do so , we carry out the replacement for the field mode operators @xmath67 where the amplitude @xmath68 is related to the running wave power @xmath69 of the incident laser . in the following we assume @xmath70 , which allows us to linearize the interaction hamiltonians @xmath71 and @xmath72 around the laser by only keeping terms of order @xmath68 and @xmath73 .",
    "we start with the membrane - field interaction @xmath20 by inserting the field expansion in eq . together with the mode functions given in eq . into eq . , and then apply the above replacement to the field operators .",
    "the contribution @xmath74 yields a constant force on the membrane that can be accounted for by a redefinition of its equilibrium position .",

    "we focus on the case of small membrane reflection @xmath79 , such that the cavity response is not altered significantly by the presence of the membrane and assume that the laser is resonant with a cavity mode . as motivated in sec.[sec : effdyn ] below , we further assume a ` bad cavity ' regime , where the cavity half - linewidth @xmath80 is much larger than the separation of the relevant sidebands from the laser frequency @xmath61 ( see fig.[fig : badcavity ] ) . in this case we may approximate @xmath81 , such that @xmath82 , and by using @xmath83 we obtain @xmath84 with the phase difference @xmath85 and the membrane - field coupling constant @xmath86 in the limit @xmath87 of a thin membrane and small but constant reflection @xmath88 we can write the membrane - field coupling constant as @xmath89 where we assumed @xmath90 in the second line . this corresponds to placing the membrane on the slope of the intra - cavity intensity , where the coupling is maximal .",
    "in contrast , at points of zero intensity the coupling vanishes and higher orders in @xmath23 would have to be considered @xcite .",
    "however , these points will not be relevant in this work .",
    "note that the coupling in eq .",
    "is enhanced by the finesse and that a similar calculation for a cavity with movable end mirror yields exactly the same interaction in eq . , but with @xmath91 , as detailed in appendix [ app : mirror ] .",
    "the next step is the expansion of the ac - stark shift hamiltonian @xmath21 in powers of @xmath68 .",
    "we insert eq . with the mode functions of eq . into eq . and apply the replacement eq .. the resulting contribution proportional to @xmath73 provides an optical lattice trap that is seen by each atom and that is described by the potential @xmath92 with lattice depth @xmath93 .",

    "we replace the @xmath94 by the center - of - mass position @xmath104 of the whole ensemble , which is a good approximation if @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the linear extension of the ensemble . for typical experimental parameters",
    "this assumption is fulfilled in general , see sec.[sec : exprel ] .",

    "we neglect the constant contribution in eq . and together with eq .",
    "and eq . the linearized hamiltonian in a frame rotating at the laser frequency reads @xmath110 here , @xmath111 and we have absorbed the phase factors @xmath112 appearing in eqs . and into the field operators @xmath33 .",
    "the effect of the cavity response @xmath52 enters both via the membrane - field coupling @xmath113 , which depends on @xmath114 , and the phase @xmath115 contained in @xmath116 .",
    "we are interested in deriving the effective equations of motion ( eoms ) describing the coupling between atoms and mechanical oscillator , which are obtained by eliminating the light field in a born - markov approximation .",
    "motivated by the experimental considerations presented below in sec.[sec : exprel ] , we focus in the following on the ` bad cavity ' regime , where the cavity half - linewidth @xmath80 is much larger than the atomic and mechanical frequency , i.e. @xmath117 as depicted in fig.[fig : badcavity ] . also assuming the weak - coupling conditions @xmath118 we find that the resonant terms in eq .",
    "involve field operators at the sideband frequencies @xmath119 , and we choose @xmath120 to ensure resonant interactions .",
    "we further assume that the laser is resonant with a cavity mode , i.e. @xmath121 as shown in fig.[fig : badcavity ] , which yields a high intra - cavity intensity , but also ensures that both sidebands enter the cavity equally well , i.e. , that there is no spectral filtering . in the described regime the cavity",
    "adiabatically follows the mechanical oscillator and the atoms and needs not to be treated as an independent degree of freedom .",
    "the opposite ` resolved sideband ' limit , where @xmath122 , would require a different treatment and is not considered in this work .",
    "finally note that the assumptions described here already entered in the derivation of eq ..     and @xmath123 ) correspond to a conversion between laser photons @xmath61 ( black ) and sideband photons @xmath124 ( blue / dark and red / light ) .",
    "the response profile of the cavity is indicated by the green dashed line and easily accommodates both sidebands in the ` bad cavity ' regime discussed in the text.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      we start by stating the complete hierarchy of timescales for our calculation @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the propagation time between mechanics and atomic ensemble .",
    "the left - most inequality is needed to model the atom - light interaction by an ac - stark shift as described in sec.[sec : hamiltonian ] .",
    "we assume a broad spectrum of field modes such that its bandwidth @xmath30 is large compared to all frequencies associated with the system evolution .",
    "below , this allows us to distinguish the temporal order of the light field s interactions with the atoms and the mechanical resonator .",
    "motivated by experimental parameters ( see sec.[sec : exprel ] ) , we assume that the retardation time between the two systems is short compared to the system s evolution , i.e. @xmath127 . finally , we have the bad cavity assumption as well as the weak - coupling assumptions @xmath118 as discussed in the the previous paragraph .    to derive the effective eoms for mechanical oscillator and atoms we start with the heisenberg eoms for the quadrature operators obtained from the linearized hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( see appendix [ app : elimination ] for details ) .",
    "we then formally integrate the eoms for the field quadratures . by inserting the resulting expressions into the heisenberg equations for mechanics and atoms and applying the born - markov approximation",
    ", we obtain effective quantum langevin equations ( qles ) with interactions retarded by a time @xmath128 .",
    "the additional contribution @xmath129 represents the retardation due to the cavity and follows from the taylor expansion of @xmath130 around the cavity resonance . from eq .",
    "we see that @xmath131 , so that we can neglect these retardations in the following , and thus obtain effective qles that are local in time :    [ eq : qles ] @xmath132    here , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are defined below , and @xmath135 is the effective coupling between the two systems . from the above equations we can read off the corresponding effective hamiltonian @xmath136 where the effective coherent coupling @xmath137 contains the desired enhancements and",
    "is explicitly given by @xmath138    the noise operator @xmath133 appearing in eq . is hermitian and represents the radiation pressure noise originating from the intra - cavity light field .",
    "it is characterized by the two - time correlation function @xmath139 and the associated diffusion rate @xmath140 appearing in eq .. the expression @xmath141 denotes a representation of the @xmath142-function that is peaked on the timescale @xmath143 .",
    "as explained in appendix [ app : elimination ] this momentum diffusion rate appears as a fundamental limitation in any optomechanical system , and it was recently observed in an experiment @xcite .      in the following",
    "we will discuss the main decoherence channels of the mechanical oscillator and the atoms .",
    "in addition to the radiation pressure noise derived above , these include thermal decoherence due to finite support temperature and absorption of laser photons in the membrane , as well as light - induced momentum diffusion of the atoms .",
    "the mechanical resonator is coupled to a support of temperature @xmath144 , which leads to a finite linewidth @xmath145 due to clamping losses , but also to thermal decoherence at rate @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath148 the mechanical quality factor .",
    "in addition , the membrane is also heated by absorbing photons from the coupling laser .",
    "we model this heating effect by introducing an effective bath temperature @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the temperature increase due to absorbed laser power @xmath151 in the center of the membrane , representing a worst - case estimate @xcite .",
    "the thermal link @xmath152 connects the center of the membrane to the support and depends on the thermal conductivity and the thickness of the membrane , as well as the beam waist of the laser ( see appendix [ app : abs ] ) .",
    "further , the absorbed power for a membrane sitting on a slope of the intra - cavity intensity is given by @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the power absorption coefficient .",
    "the resulting effective bath occupation is thus given by @xmath155 as described in more detail in appendix [ app : abs ] .",
    "atoms in a 3d standing wave undergo diffusion processes . in our treatment",
    "these diffusion processes drop out as an artifact of the 1d model , as already mentioned in appendix [ app : elimination ] and in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , we have to add the proper momentum diffusion for atoms in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) standing wave as , e.g. , derived in ref.@xcite and given by @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the natural linewidth of the transition .",

    "such loss could be modeled by placing a beam - splitter of suitable reflectivity between the two systems , such that the light fields @xmath101 are coupled to additional vacuum modes . integrating out the light fields as above",
    "would then yield a reduced coherent coupling , analogous to the situation treated in refs .",
    "@xcite . there , a similar setup without cavity was discussed , and photon loss through the membrane into the @xmath164 direction was included ( cf .",

    "in the previous sections , we have reduced the description of our setup to the effective qles and , which feature a coherent coupling between atoms and membrane as described by the effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , they also contain a number of thermal and light - induced noise sources , whose impact we discuss in the following for two different scenarios .",
    "our final goal is to establish interesting regimes of operation for the proposed setup .      as a first scenario we consider the observation of the coherent dynamics induced by the interaction term in the hamiltonian .",
    "a signature of the coupling is the normal mode splitting @xmath165 , which is visible in the fluctuation spectra of the oscillators , as soon as it exceeds their amplitude decay rates ( see ref .",

    "clearly , increasing the finesse beyond a certain optimal value does _ not _ yield lower occupation numbers , in contrast to the tendency derived above .",

    "in particular , we find @xmath211 for @xmath212 and @xmath213 khz .",
    "we thus conclude that ground state cooling of the membrane is possible for realistic experimental parameters .",
    "besides the formal similarity of our cooling scheme to optomechanical cavity cooling , there are two important differences .",
    "first , the atomic dissipation is _ tunable _ , i.e. , after cooling the membrane close to its ground state one can switch off the dissipation and then observe coherent dynamics between the two systems ( sec.[sec : cohdyn ] ) .",
    "this is not the case in cavity optomechanics , where the cavity decay is fixed .",
    "second , our scheme does not require ` resolved sideband ' conditions for the cavity . on the contrary ,",
    "we want to operate in a regime where @xmath214 , which greatly relaxes the experimental requirements on the cavity . in this sense",
    ", the cooling scheme described here is complementary to standard optomechanical cavity cooling .",
    "in order to experimentally realize this proposal , we intend to use a micromechanical membrane in a fabry - prot cavity in the so - called ` membrane - in - the - middle ' geometry  @xcite . we will pre - cool the membrane - cavity setup in a cryostat where high mechanical quality factors up to @xmath215 @xcite as well as low absorption of @xmath216 in the near infrared @xcite have been observed . in particular , we aim to use a stoichiometric sin membrane of dimension 1  mm@xmath217 with a thickness of @xmath218  nm .",
    "such a membrane has an effective mass of @xmath219  kg and a fundamental mechanical mode near @xmath220  khz .    on the atomic side ,",
    "we consider using an ultracold gas of @xmath221rb atoms . because the coupling @xmath137 scales as @xmath222 , obtaining large atom numbers is crucial to reaching the quantum coherent regime and achieving ground state sympathetic cooling .",

    "the resulting 3d lattice isolates the atoms from each other , mitigating trap loss due to light - assisted collisions @xcite .",
    "choosing blue detuning for the coupling lattice reduces spontaneous photon scattering , allowing for reduced laser detunings .",
    "this enables lower input powers to achieve the same trap frequency so that larger values of the cavity finesse can be obtained without causing too much absorption - induced heating of the membrane .    using the expressions for couplings and decoherence processes ( including membrane heating )",
    ", one can find experimental parameters that optimize the ratio of total decoherence to coherent coupling or the ground state membrane occupation .",
    "in doing so , a clear trend towards minimizing the atomic detuning emerges .",
    "however , such a prediction neglects the multi - level structure of the atom . for a sufficiently large lattice detuning and linear polarization ,",
    "all ground - state hyperfine @xmath224 levels experience the same trapping potential @xcite . at smaller detunings ,",
    "the potential becomes state - dependent and optical pumping between different @xmath224 levels induced by scattering of photons from the lattice light will reduce the coupling to the membrane .",
