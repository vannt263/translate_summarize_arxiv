    "the use of ultra - short pulses to perform precision spectroscopy has gained increased interest due to the development of phase - stabilized optical frequency combs ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of direct frequency - comb spectroscopy ) .",
    "one of the chief advantages of using the output of an optical frequency comb to directly excite atomic transitions is the spectral versatility afforded by the comb",
    ". stabilized optical frequency combs of the types used here contain @xmath4 optical frequencies spanning the entire visible spectrum .",
    "thus , the optical frequency comb acts effectively as a large number of cw lasers with frequencies given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an integer denoting the mode of the comb , @xmath7 is the repetition rate of the laser , and @xmath8 is the carrier - envelope - offset frequency ( for a review of frequency combs see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "two - photon direct frequency - comb spectroscopy with a fully stabilized comb was first applied to the study of cold rubidium atoms @xcite . in these experiments",
    "independent control of @xmath8 and @xmath7 was used to explore the effects of resonant enhancement of the two - photon transition rate due to resonance with an intermediate state .",
    "two - photon direct frequency - comb spectroscopy has also been applied to the study of room - temperature atomic cesium confined to a vapor cell @xcite .",
    "the transitions studied in that work were excited via two - photon excitation through a resonant intermediate state using velocity - selective excitation .    here ,",
    "we further explore velocity - selective , two - photon excitation both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "in particular , we consider the effect of the repetition rate of the comb on the spectra .",
    "we identify two different regimes : one in which the repetition rate of the comb is larger than the doppler width of the resonance corresponding to the first stage of the transition and one in which the repetition rate is smaller than the doppler width of the resonance of the first stage of the transition .",
    "we present data for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 transitions in atomic rubidium taken with two different optical frequency combs with different repetition rates .",
    "we compare our results to a model calculation and see how the velocity selection process differs for the two cases .",
    "in addition , we explore how the energy of the intermediate state affects the two - photon spectra and explain the qualitative differences in the spectra that arise from excitation through different intermediate states .",
    "the two - photon transition probability between two states @xmath11 and @xmath12 is given by @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the velocity of the atom , @xmath15 is the electric dipole operator , @xmath16 is the unit vector along the direction of the polarization for the first(second ) laser beam of intensity @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the homogeneous line widths of the states @xmath20 and @xmath12 , respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the resonant angular frequencies of the transitions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the sum over @xmath25 includes all possible intermediate states .",
    "we have assumed that the laser frequency @xmath26 is near the single - photon resonance of the @xmath23 transitions and have neglected the possibility of @xmath27 exciting the first stage of the transition .",
    "if we further assume that there is a single intermediate state that is close in energy to @xmath26 we can reduce the sum to a single term consisting of the nearly resonant intermediate state .",
    "the maximum transition probability will occur when both the two - photon resonance condition and the single - photon resonance condition are met : @xmath28    when an optical frequency comb is used to excite an atomic transition , the transition rate must be summed over all of the optical modes in the comb [ the frequencies of which are given by eq .  ] .",
    "resonance will occur if there are any comb modes @xmath29 and @xmath30 resulting in frequencies @xmath26 and @xmath27 that simultaneously satisfy eqs .   and .",
    "if we consider the situation where the comb light is counter - propagated through the atomic sample ( so that @xmath31 ) we can write the resonance conditions as @xmath32 where we have defined the @xmath33 axis to be the direction of propagation of the light and taken @xmath34 to be the @xmath33 component of the atomic velocity . for a given @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath8",
    "there exists a repetition rate , @xmath7 , which will satisfy the above equations for some value of @xmath34 .",
    "if the velocity class corresponding to @xmath34 that satisfies the resonance conditions is populated in the atomic distribution , there will be resonant excitation to the state @xmath12 in the atomic sample .",
    "in this work we have investigated this velocity - selective excitation with two different frequency combs having different repetition rates .",
    "the first situation we consider is the case where the repetition rate of the comb is larger than the doppler width of the resonance corresponding to the first stage of the excitation . in this case",
    "there will exist , at most , one comb mode @xmath29 which is resonant with a velocity class present in the atomic sample . as a result",
    ", there will be at most a single pair of comb modes @xmath29 and @xmath30 that sum up to a total mode number @xmath35 that satisfy the resonance conditions given by eqs .   and for a velocity class present in the atomic sample .",
    "as the repetition rate is scanned the velocity class excited to the first stage of the transition changes as the frequency @xmath26 sweeps over the doppler broadened transition .",
    "once the velocity class that is excited to the intermediate state @xmath20 also satisfies the resonance condition for @xmath36 , the atoms will be excited to the final state @xmath12 .",
    "this results in a sub - doppler resonant peak .",
    "if the repetition rate is increased over a large enough range a different pair of comb modes , adding up to @xmath37 will satisfy the resonance requirement and the resonant peak will recur .",
    "however , because the velocity class that satisfies the resonant condition will , in general , be different , the relative amplitude of the @xmath38 peak may vary greatly as compared to the @xmath39 peak ; reflecting the relative population in the resonant velocity classes .",
    "the amount the repetition rate must scan before the spectrum repeats is @xmath40 if the laser beams are exactly counter - propagating throughout the excitation region then the width of the resonance in terms of the repetition rate , @xmath41 , is approximately the natural line width of the excited state divided by the total mode number : @xmath42    the second case we consider is that in which the repetition rate of the frequency comb is less than the doppler width of the resonance corresponding to the first stage of the transition . in this case",
    "there are multiple comb modes resonant with the first stage of the transition for different velocity classes .",
    "consequently , there are multiple pairs of comb modes ( @xmath43 ) , having the same total mode number @xmath44 , that will lead to resonant excitation for different velocity classes . in general",
    ", the different velocity classes will be resonant at different repetition rates .",
    "the result is a spectrum that has a comb - like structure as different pairs of comb modes contribute .",
    "figure [ fig vselectionsmallfr ]  ( a ) shows the excitation of the different velocity classes to the intermediate and final states for three different values of the repetition rate .",
    "the resonant repetition rate , @xmath45 , is the repetition rate at which the largest number of atoms are are excited to the final state .",
    "this corresponds to excitation of a velocity class that is near zero .",
    "there are additional resonances when the repetition rate is below ( above ) the resonance value , leading to excitation of velocity classes that have negative ( positive ) velocity along the propagation direction of the laser beam that excites the first stage of the transition .",
    "k. as the repetition rate is varied the velocity classes excited to the intermediate state move through the distribution .",
    "when the repetition rate satisfies the resonant condition for a given ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and for a specific velocity class atoms are excited to the final state .",
    "figure ( a ) shows the case where the resonant repetition rate is different for the different mode pairs and velocity classes , leading to multiple peaks in the spectrum .",
    "the calculation is based on a three - level model where the frequencies of the intermediate and final states correspond to the frequencies of the @xmath46 state excited through the @xmath47 state .",

    "this is the case for the @xmath51 transition in rubidium , where the intermediate state is only 1.5 thz from the mid - point of the ground - to - final - state energy separation . in this case , the different velocity classes satisfy the resonance conditions at nearly the same repetition rates .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the doppler shift is wavelength dependent . as a result ,",
    "the apparent spacing of comb modes in  velocity space \" is similar if the wavelengths for the first and second stages of the transition are similar and are different for the two stages if the wavelengths are different . in the case of where the wavelengths are similar",
    "the spectrum is significantly simpler than the more general case described above and there is no comb - like structure in the spectrum .",

    "these values correspond to the @xmath51 and @xmath52 transitions , respectively .",
