    "gene regulation  the ability of cells to modulate the expression level of genes to match their current needs  is crucial for survival .",
    "one important determinant of this process is the wiring diagram of the regulatory network , specifying how environmental or internal signals are detected , propagated , and combined to orchestrate protein level changes @xcite . beyond the wiring diagram , the capacity of the network to reliably transmit information about signal variations",
    "is determined also by the strength of the network interactions ( the `` numbers on the arrows '' @xcite ) , the dynamics of the response , and the noise inherent to chemical processes happening at low copy numbers @xcite .",
    "how do these factors combine to set the regulatory power of the cell ?",
    "information theory can provide a general measure of the limits to which a cell can reliably control its gene expression levels . especially in the context of developmental processes , where the precise establishment and readout of positional information has long been appreciated as crucial  @xcite",
    ", information theory can provide a quantitative proxy for the biological function of gene regulation @xcite .",
    "this has led to theoretical predictions of optimal networks that maximize transmitted information given biophysical constraints @xcite , and hypotheses that certain biological networks might have evolved to maximize transmitted information @xcite .",
    "some evidence for these ideas has been provided by recent high - precision measurements in the gap gene network of the fruit fly @xcite . in parallel to this line of research , information theory has been used as a general and quantitative way to compare signal processing motifs @xcite .",
    "further theoretical work has demonstrated a relationship between the information capacity of an organism s regulatory circuits and its evolutionary fitness @xcite .",
    "previously , information theoretic investigations primarily examined the role of the regulatory network .",
    "here we focus on the molecular level , i.e. , on the events taking place at the regulatory regions of the dna .",
    "little is known about how the architecture of such microscopic events shapes information transfer in gene regulation .",
    "yet it is precisely at these regulatory regions that the mapping from the `` inputs '' in the network wiring diagram into the corresponding `` output '' expression level is implemented by individual molecular interactions . in this bottleneck various physical sources of stochasticity  such as the binding and diffusion of molecules @xcite , and the discrete nature of chemical reactions @xcite  must play an important role . in the simplest picture ,",
    "gene expression is modulated through transcriptional regulation .",
    "this involves molecular events like the binding of transcription factors ( tfs ) to specific sites on the dna , chemical events that facilitate or block tf binding ( e.g. , through chromatin modification ) , or events that are subsequently required to initiate transcription ( e.g. , the assembly and activation of the transcription machinery ) .",
    "while the exact sequence of molecular events at the regulatory regions often remains elusive ( especially in eukaryotes ) , quantitative measurements have highlighted factors that contribute to the fidelity by which tfs can affect the expression of their target genes .",
    "these findings have been succinctly summarized by the so - called `` telegraph model '' of transcriptional regulation @xcite : the two - state promoter switches stochastically between the states `` on '' and `` off '' , with switching rates dependent on the concentration(s ) of the regulatory factor(s ) .",
    "this dependence can either be biophysically motivated ( e.g. by a thermodynamic model of tf binding to dna ) , or it can be considered as purely phenomenological . the switching itself is independent of mrna production , but determines the overall production rate .",
    "the production of mrna molecules from one state is usually modeled as a poisson process , with a first - order decay of messages ; this is usually followed by a birth - death process in which proteins are translated from the messages .",
    "this two - state model is well - studied theoretically @xcite and has been used extensively to account for measurements of noise in gene expression @xcite .",
    "an increasing amount of information about molecular details has motivated extensions to this model by introducing more than two states in specific systems @xcite , and recent measurements of noise in gene expression provided some support for such complex regulatory schemes @xcite .    here",
    "we address the general question of the functional effect of complex promoters with multiple internal states .",
    "how does the presence of multiple promoter states affect information transmission ? which promoter architectures transmit information more reliably when placed into a regulatory network ? under what conditions ,",
    "if any , can multi - state promoters perform better than the two - state model ? to address these questions",
    ", we consider a wide spectrum of generic promoter models that can be treated mathematically as state transition diagrams ; many molecular `` implementations '' could thus share the same underlying model . when placed into a network",
    ", one must further specify which of the transitions are affected by concentrations of regulatory proteins , and which of the promoter states have nonzero expression rates . with this framework in hand",
    ", we derive the total noise in mrna expression as a function of the induction level for all two- and three - state promoter models , and discuss how measurements of this function can be diagnostic of the underlying mechanism of regulation . to answer the main question of this paper  namely if additional complexity at the promoter can lead to an improvement in controlling the output level of a gene  we compute the information transmission from transcription factor concentrations to regulated protein expression levels through two- and three - state promoters .",
    "finally , we analyze in detail three complex promoter architectures that outperform the two - state regulation .",
    "we start by considering a genetic regulatory element  e.g. , a promoter or an enhancer  as a communication channel , shown in fig  [ fig : setup]a .",
    "as the concentrations of the relevant inputs ( for example , transcription factors ) change , the regulatory element responds by varying the rate of target gene expression . in steady state , the relationship between input @xmath0 and expression level of the regulated protein @xmath1 is often thought of as a `` regulatory function '' @xcite . while attractive , the notion of a regulatory _ function _ in a mathematical sense is perhaps misleading : gene regulation is a noisy process , and so for a fixed value of the input we have not one , but a distribution of different possible output expression levels , @xmath2 ( see fig  [ fig : setup]b ) . when the noise is small , it is useful to think of a regulatory function as describing the _ average _ expression level , @xmath3 , and of the noise as inducing some random fluctuation around that average .",
    "the variance of these fluctuations , @xmath4 , is thus a measure of noise in the regulatory element ; note that its magnitude depends on the input , @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of noise puts a bound on how precisely changes in the input can be mapped into resulting expression levels on the output side  or inversely , how much the cell can know about the input by observing the ( noisy ) outputs alone . in his seminal work on information",
    "theory @xcite , shannon introduced a way to quantify this intuition by means of _ mutual information _",
    ", which is an assumption - free , positive scalar measure in bits , defined as @xmath5 \\quad .",
    "\\label{info1}\\ ] ] in eq  ( [ info1 ] ) , @xmath2 is a property of the regulatory element , which we will be computing below , while @xmath6 is the distribution of inputs ( e.g. tf concentrations ) that regulate the expression ; finally , @xmath7 is the resulting distribution of gene expression levels . with @xmath2 set by the properties of the regulatory element and the biophysics of the gene expression machinery",
    ", there exists an optimal choice for the distribution of inputs , @xmath8 , that maximizes the transmitted information .",
    "this maximal value , @xmath9 , also known as the _ channel capacity _ @xcite , summarizes in a single number the `` regulatory power '' intrinsic to the regulatory element @xcite .",
    "our goal is to compute the channel capacity between the ( single ) regulatory input and the target gene expression level for information flowing through various complex promoters . under the assumption that noise is small and approximately gaussian for all levels of input , the complicated expression for the information transmission in eq  ( [ info1 ] ) simplifies , and",
    "the channel capacity @xmath10 can be computed analytically from the regulatory function , @xmath11 , and the noise , @xmath12 .",
    "the result is that @xcite @xmath13 where in the last equality we changed the integration variables to express the result in terms of the average induction level , @xmath14 , using the regulatory function @xmath15 .",
    "this integral is graphically depicted in fig  [ fig : setup]c ( inset ) .",
    "finally , we will use this to explore the dependence of @xmath10 on parameters that define the promoter architecture ( see fig  [ fig : setup]d ) , looking for those arrangements that lead to large channel capacities and thus high regulatory power .",
    "information as a measure of regulatory power has a number of attractive mathematical properties ( for review , see @xcite ) ; interpretation - wise , the crucial property is that it roughly counts ( the logarithm of ) the number of distinguishable levels of expression that are accessible by varying the input  also taking into account the level of noise in the system .",
    "a capacity of  1  bit therefore suggests that the gene regulatory element could act as a binary switch with two distinguishable expression levels ; capacities smaller than  1  bit correspond to ( biased ) stochastic switching , while capacities higher than  1  bit support graded regulation .",
    "an increase of information by  1  bit means that the number of tunable and distinguishable levels of gene expression has roughly doubled  ( ! ) , implying that changes of less than a bit are meaningful .",
    "careful analyses of gene expression data for single - input single - output transcriptional regulation suggest that real capacities can exceed  1  bit @xcite . increasing this number substantially beyond a few bits , however , necessitates very low levels of noise in gene regulation , requiring prohibitive numbers of signaling molecules @xcite .",
    "( double circle ) expresses mrna @xmath16 at rate @xmath17 , which are then degraded with rate @xmath18 .",
    "transition into @xmath19 ( green arrow ) is affected by the input that modulates rate @xmath20 .",
    "stochastic transitions between promoter states @xmath21 are an important contribution to the noise , @xmath22 . * ( b ) * a possible mechanistic interpretation of the diagram in a : state 1 is an unoccupied promoter , state 2 is an inaccessible promoter ( occupied by a nucleosome or repressor , black square ) .",
    "transition to the active state ( green arrow ) is modulated by changing the concentration @xmath23 of activators ( filled triangles ) which bind their cognate site ( empty triangles ) at the promoter with the rate @xmath24 . ]    to study information transmission , we must first introduce the noise model in gene regulation , which consists of two components : _ ( i ) _ , the generalization of the random telegraph model to multiple states , and _",
    "( ii ) _ , the model for input noise that captures fluctuations in the number of regulatory molecules . starting with _ ( i ) _ , we compute here the mean and variance for regulated mrna levels , since these quantities are experimentally accessible when probing noise in gene expression .",
    "we assume that the system has reached steady state and that gene product degradation is the slowest timescale in the problem , i.e. , that target mrna or protein levels average over multiple state transitions of the promoter and that the resulting distributions of mrna and protein are thus unimodal .",
    "while for protein levels these assumptions hold over a wide range of parameters and include many biologically relevant cases , there exist examples where promoter switching is very slow and the system would need to be treated with greater care ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let us represent the possible states of the promoter ( and the transitions between them ) by a state transition graph as in fig  [ fig : stategraph]a .",
    "gene regulation occurs when an input signal modifies one ( or more ) of the rates at which the promoter switches between its states . to systematically analyze many promoter architectures , we choose not to endow from the start each graph with a mechanistic interpretation , which would map the abstract promoter states to various configurations of certain molecules on the regulatory regions of the dna ( as in fig  [ fig : stategraph]b )",
    "this is because there might be numerous molecular realizations of the same abstract scheme , which will yield identical noise characteristics and identical information transmission . in fig",
    "[ fig : schemes ] and fig  s1 , we discuss known examples related to different promoter architectures .    given a specific promoter architecture , we would like to compute the first two moments of the mrna distribution under the above assumptions . here , we only sketch the method for the promoter in fig  [ fig : stategraph]a ; for a general description and details see supplementary information .",
    "we will denote the rate of mrna production from the active state(s ) by @xmath17 and its degradation rate by @xmath18 .",
    "let further @xmath25 be the fractional occupancy of state @xmath26 and @xmath27 the rate of transitioning from state @xmath28  to  @xmath29 . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the active state , and @xmath30 are the non - expressing states",
    ". equations  ( [ eqn : overall ] ) and  ( [ eqn : transmatrix ] ) then describe the behavior of the state occupancy and mrna level @xmath16 : @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 are langevin white - noise random forces @xcite ( see supplementary information ) . in this setup",
    "it is easy to compute the mean and the variance in expression levels given a set of chosen rate constants . using the assumption of slow gene product degradation , @xmath36 ,",
    "we can write the noise in a generic way : @xmath37   , \\label{eqn : var1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the occupancy of the active states ( @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) , and the dimensionless expression for @xmath41 depends on the promoter architecture and can be read out from fig  [ fig : schemes]a for different promoter models .",
    "the expression for noise in eq  ( [ eqn : var1 ] ) has two contributions .",
    "the first , where the variance is equal to the mean ( @xmath42 ) is the `` output noise '' due to the birth - death production of single mrna molecules ( also called `` shot noise '' or `` poisson noise '' ) . the second contribution to the variance in eq  ( [ eqn : var1 ] ) is due to stochastic switching of the promoter between internal states , referred to as the `` switching noise . ''",
    "this term does depend on the promoter architecture and has a more complicated functional form than being simply proportional to the mean .",
    "a first glance at the expressions for noise seems to imply that going from two to three promoter states can only increase the noise ( and by eq  ( [ info3 ] ) decrease information ) , since new , positive contributions appear in the expressions for @xmath43 ; we will see that , nevertheless , transmitted information can increase for certain architectures .",
    "in addition to the noise sources internal to the regulatory mechanism , we also consider the propagation of fluctuations in the input , which will contribute to the observed variance in the gene expression level .",
    "can we say anything general about the transmission of input fluctuations through the genetic regulatory element ?",
    "consider , for instance , the modulated rate @xmath0 that depends on the concentration @xmath23 of some transcription factor , as in @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the association rate to the tf s binding site .",
    "since the tf itself is expressed in a stochastic process , we could expect that there will be ( at least ) poisson - like fluctuations in @xmath23 itself , such that @xmath46 ; this will lead to an effective variance in @xmath0 that will be propagated to the output variance in proportion to the `` susceptibility '' of the regulatory element , @xmath47 .",
    "extrinsic noise would affect the regulatory element in an analogous way , as suggested in ref  @xcite .",
    "independently of the noise origin , we can write @xmath48 where @xmath49 indicate output and switching terms from eq  ( [ eqn : var2 ] ) and @xmath50 is the proportionality constant ( @xmath51 ) that is related to the magnitude of the input fluctuations and , possibly , their subsequent time averaging @xcite .    even if there were absolutely no fluctuations in the total concentration @xmath23 of transcription factor molecules in the cell ( or the nucleus ) , the sole fact that they need to find the regulatory site by diffusion puts a lower bound on the variance of the _ local concentration _ at the regulatory site .",
    "this diffusion limit , first formulated for the case of bacterial chemotaxis by berg and purcell @xcite , has been subsequently derived for the general case of biochemical signaling @xcite : the lower bound on the variance in local concentration obeys @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the diffusion constant of the tf molecules , @xmath54 is the linear size of the binding site , and @xmath55 is the noise averaging time ( here the lifetime of the gene product ) . analyses of high - precision measurements in gene expression noise during early fruit fly development have shown that this diffusion noise represents a substantial contribution to the total @xcite .",
    "thus , for this biophysical limit set by diffusion , we find yet again that the variance in the input is proportional to the input itself .",
    "this , in sum , demonstrates that eq  ( [ eqn : diffnoise ] ) can be used as a very generic model for diverse kinds of input noise . to see which values the constant @xmath50 can take ,",
    "note that @xmath56 . as an example , consider diffusion - limited association , where @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "depending on the accuracy and the geometry of the sensing mechanism we now get different values for @xmath58 , but in general @xmath59 is expected to be of order unity .",
    "for example , the perfect absorbing sphere has @xmath60 and therefore @xmath61 ; the perfect monitoring sphere in the berg ",
    "purcell limit has @xmath62 and therefore @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "could complex promoter architectures be distinguished by their noise signatures , even in the easiest case where the input noise can be neglected ( as is often assumed @xcite ) ?",
    "the expressions for the noise presented in fig  [ fig : schemes]a hold independently of which transition rate the input is modulating .",
    "we can specialize these results by choosing the _ modulation scheme _ , that is , making one ( or more ) of the transition rates the regulated one .",
    "this allows us to construct the regulatory function ( insets in fig  [ fig : schemes]b ) .",
    "additionally , we can also plot the noise ( here shown as the fano factor , @xmath64 ) as a function of the mean expression , @xmath65 , thus getting the _ noise characteristic _ of every modulation scheme .",
    "these curves , shown in fig  [ fig : schemes]b , are often accessible from experiments @xcite , even when the identity of the expressing state or the mechanism of modulation are unknown .",
    "we systematically organize our results in fig  [ fig : schemes]b ( for the case when @xmath20 is modulated ) , and provide a full version in fig  s1 ; we also list four molecular schemes implementing these architectures in fig  [ fig : schemes]c , while providing additional molecular implementations in fig  s1 .",
    "we emphasize that very different molecular mechanisms of regulation can be represented by the same architecture , resulting in the same mathematical analysis and information capacity .",
    "measured noise - vs - mean curves have been used to distinguish between various regulation models @xcite . for this , two conditions have to be met @xcite .",
    "first , it must be possible to access the full dynamic range of the gene expression in an experiment , and this sometimes seems hard to ensure .",
    "the second condition is that the input noise is not the dominant source of noise : input noise can mimic promoter switching noise and can , e.g. , provide alternative explanations for noise measurements in @xcite that quantitatively fit the data ( not shown ) .",
    "even if these conditions are met , it would be impossible to distinguish between certain promoter architectures ( e.g. , 2-a1 vs. 3e - a1 ) with this method , while some would require data of a very high quality to distinguish ( e.g. , activating 3e-1a vs. repressing 3e-12 , see fig  s1 ) , at least in certain parameter regimes .",
    "on the other hand , there exist noise characteristics that can only be obtained with multiple states ( e.g. , 3m-1a ) .",
    "one feature that can easily be extracted from the measured noise characteristics is the asymptotic induction : it can be equal to @xmath66 ( e.g. , in 2 - 1a ) , or bounded away from @xmath66 ( e.g. , in 3m-1a ) . while this distinction between architectures can not be inferred from the shapes of the regulatory functions , the effect on the noise characteristics is unambiguous : in the case where the expressing state is never saturated , the fano factor does not drop to the poisson limit of 1 even at the highest expression levels ( which seems to have been the case in ref  @xcite ) .    taken together ,",
    "when the range of promoter architectures is extended beyond the two - state model , distinguishing between these architectures based on the noise characteristics seems possible only under restricted conditions , emphasizing the need for dynamical measurements that directly probe transition rates ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or for the measurements of the full mrna distribution ( rather then only its second moment ) .",
    "we note that dynamic rates are often reported _ assuming _ the two - state model , as they are inferred from the steady state noise measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and only a few experiments probe the rates directly ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; for a brief review of the rates and their typical magnitudes see supplementary information .",

    "a well - studied example is in hedgehog ( hh ) signaling , where the tf gli acts as a repressor when hh is low , or as an activator when hh is high @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dual]a shows a possible dual - role signaling scheme where the total concentration of dual - role tfs is fixed ( at @xmath94 ) , but the signal modulates the fraction of these tfs that play the activator role ( @xmath0 ) and the remaining fraction that act as repressors ( @xmath119 ) , which compete for the same binding site .",
    "the channel capacity of this motif is depicted in fig  [ fig : dual]b as a function of promoter parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 , showing that a globally optimal setting ( denoted `` a '' ) exists for these parameters ; with these parameters , the input / output function , shown in fig  [ fig : dual]c , is much steeper than what could be achieved with the best two - state promoter , and that is true despite the fact that the molecular implementation of this architecture uses only a single binding site .",
    "the ability to access such steep regulatory curves allows this architecture to position the mid - point of induction at higher inputs @xmath0 , thus escaping the detrimental effects of the input noise at low @xmath0 , while still being able to induce almost completely ( i.e. , make use of the full dynamic range of outputs ) as the input varies from 0 to @xmath94 .",
    "this is how the dual - role regulation can escape the tradeoff faced by the two - state model 2 - 1a ( shown in fig  [ fig : optimize ] ) .",
    "sharper transition at higher input would lead us to expect that the advantage of this architecture over the two - state model is most pronounced when input noise is dominant ( small @xmath94 , large @xmath95 ) , which is indeed the case , as shown in fig  [ fig : dual]d . * promotor cycling .",
    "* in the last architecture considered here , promoters `` cycle '' through a sequence of states in a way that does not obey detailed balance , e.g. , when state transitions involve expenditure of energy during irreversible reaction steps . in the scheme shown in fig  [ fig : cycling]a , the regulated transition puts the promoter into an active state @xmath19 ; before decaying to an inactive state , the promoter must transition through another active state @xmath115 .",
    "effectively , this scheme is similar to the two - state model in which the decay from the active state is not first - order with exponentially distributed transition times , but rather with transition times that have a sharper peak .",
    "the benefits of this architecture are maximized when the transition rates from both active states are equal .",
    "while it always outperforms the optimal two - state model , the largest advantage is achievable for small @xmath94 . at large @xmath94",

    "for each value of @xmath94 , we look for the optimal choice of @xmath122 .",
    "the information and advantage relative to the optimal two - state model is shown in * ( c)*. * ( b , d ) * a similar architecture where turning the gene on is a multi - step regulated process .",
    "this architecture always underperforms the optimal two - state model , indicated by a negative value of the advantage for all choices of @xmath50 and @xmath94.,width=312 ]    figures  [ fig : cycling]c , d show that irreversible transitions alone do not generate an information advantage : a promoter that needs to transition between two inactive states ( @xmath123 ) to reach a single expressing state @xmath19 from which it exits in a first - order transition , is always at a loss compared to a two - state promoter .",
    "this is because here the effective transition rate to the active state in the equivalent two - state model is lower ( since an intermediate state must be traversed to induce ) , necessitating the use of a lower off - rate @xmath124 , which in turn leads to higher switching noise .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent experimental data on eukaryotic transcription seem to favor models in which the distribution of exit times from the expressing state is exponential , while the distribution of times from the inactive into the active state is not @xcite , pointing to the seemingly underperforming architecture of fig  [ fig : cycling]b .",
    "the three - state promoter suggested here is probably an oversimplified model of reality , yet it nevertheless makes sense to ask why irreversible transitions through multiple states are needed to switch on the transcription of eukaryotic genes @xcite and how this observation can be reconciled with the lower regulatory power of such architectures .",
    "this is the topic of our ongoing research .",
    "when studying noise in gene regulation one is usually restricted to the use of phenomenological models , rather than a fully detailed biochemical reaction scheme .",
    "simpler models , such as those studied in this paper , also allow us to decouple questions of mechanistic interpretation from the questions of functional consequences . here",
    ", we extended a well - known functional two - state model of gene expression to multiple internal states .",
    "we introduced state transition graphs to model the `` decision logic '' by which changes in the concentrations of regulatory proteins drive the switching of our genes between various states of expression .",
    "this abstract language allowed us to systematically organize and explore non - equivalent three - state promoters .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that many microscopically distinct regulatory schemes can be collapsed into equivalent classes sharing identical state transition graphs and identical information transmission properties .",
    "the functional description of multi - state promoters confers two separate benefits .",
    "first , it is able to generate measurable predictions , such as the noise vs mean induction curve . existing experimental and theoretical work using the two - state model",
    "has demonstrated how the measurements of noise constrain the space of promoter models @xcite , how the theory establishes the `` vocabulary '' by which various measured promoters can be classified and compared to each other @xcite , and how useful a baseline mathematical model can be in establishing quantitative signatures of deviation which , when observed , must lead to minimal model revisions able to accommodate new data @xcite .",
    "alternative complex promoters presented here could explain existing data better either because of the inclusion of additional states ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , or because we also included and analyzed the effects of input ( diffusive ) noise , which can mimic the effects of promoter switching noise but is often neglected @xcite . as a caveat",
    ", it appears that in many cases discriminating between promoter architectures based on the noise characteristics alone would be very difficult , and thus dynamical measurements would be necessary .",
    "the second benefit of our approach is to provide a convenient framework for assessing the functional impact of noise in gene regulation , as measured by the mutual information between the inputs and the gene expression level .",
    "we were interested in the question whether multi - state promoters can , at least in principle , perform better than the simple on / off two - state model .",
    "we find that generically , i.e. , for all three - state models where one state is expressing and only one transition is modulated by the input , the multi - state promoters underperform the two state model .",
    "higher information transmission can be achieved when these conditions are violated , and biological examples for such violations can be found .",
    "for example , we find that a multi - state promoter with cooperativity has a higher channel capacity than the best comparable two - state promoter , even when promoter switching noise is taken into account ( c.f .",
    "dual - regulation yields surprisingly high benefits , which are largest when input noise is high . in the context of metazoan development where the concentrations of the morphogen molecules can be in the nanomolar range and",
    "the input noise is therefore high @xcite , the need to establish sharp spatial domains of downstream gene expression ( as observed , @xcite ) might have favored such dual - role promoter architectures .",
    "lastly , we considered the simplest ideas for a promoter with irreversible transitions and have shown that they can lead to an increase in information transmission by sharpening the distribution of exit times from the expressing state @xcite .    the main conclusion of this article  namely that channel capacity can be increased by particular complex promoters  is testable in dedicated experiments .",
    "one could start with a simple regulatory scheme in a synthetic system and then by careful manipulation gradually introduce the possibility of additional states ( e.g. , by introducing more binding sites ) , using promoter sequences which show weaker binding for individual molecules yet allow for stronger cooperative interaction . in both the simple and complex system one could then measure the noise behavior for various input levels .",
    "information theoretic analysis of the resulting data could be used to judge if the design of higher complexity , while perhaps noisier by some other measure , is capable of transmitting more information , as predicted .    the list of multi - state promoters that can outperform the two - state regulation and for which examples in nature could be found is potentially much longer and could include combinations of features described in this article .",
    "rather than trying to find more examples , we should perhaps ask about the fundamentally different mechanisms and constraints that our analysis did not consider . in all cases that we analyzed the largest difference between the two- and three - state models was at low @xmath94 .",
    "this makes sense : at high @xmath94 the dominant source of noise is the ( bursty ) poisson production of gene products , which is the same regardless of the promoter architecture , while at low inputs , the input fluctuations filter through the promoter in ways that depend on its architecture .",
    "what other tricks could biology use to cope with input noise ? by expending energy to keep the system out of equilibrium , one could design robust reaction schemes where , for example , the binding of a regulatory protein leads ( almost ) deterministically to some tightly controlled response cycle , perhaps evading the diffusion noise limit @xcite and increasing information transmission . at the same time",
    ", cells might be confronted by sources of stochasticity we did not discuss here , for example , due to cross - talk from spurious binding of non - cognate regulators . finally , cells need to not only _ transmit _ information through their regulatory elements , but actually perform _ computations _ , that is , combine various inputs into a single output , thereby potentially discarding information .",
    "a challenging question for the future is thus about extending the information - theoretic framework to these other cases of interest .",
