    "it is vital to obtain a good description of a network topology because structure fundamentally affects function  @xcite .",
    "the internet contains millions of routers , which are grouped into thousands of subnetworks , called _ autonomous systems _ ( as ) , which are then glued into a global network by the border gateway protocol .",
    "effective engineering of the internet is predicated on a detailed understanding of issues such as the large - scale structure of its underlying physical topology , the manner in which it evolves over time , and the way in which its constituent components contribute to its overall function  @xcite .",
    "the recently introduced positive - feedback preference ( pfp ) model  @xcite is an internet as - level topology generator .",
    "the model uses two evolution mechanisms , namely the interactive growth and the positive - feedback preference .",
    "both mechanisms are inspired by , and coincident with , practical observations on the internet historic data .",
    "originally the phenomenological model was designed to match only the internet s rich - club connectivity  @xcite and the exact form of degree distribution , including the distribution of low degrees , the maximum degree and the degree distribution s power - law exponent  @xcite .",
    "it has been a pleasant surprise that numerical evaluation against the internet measurement date has shown that the model accurately reproduces a large set of other nontrivial topology characteristics as well , including the disassortative mixing  @xcite , the shortest path length  @xcite , short cycles  @xcite and the betweenness centrality  @xcite .",
    "the pfp model has been used in more realistic simulations of the internet , e.g.  @xcite .    as of this writing , an analytical solution of the pfp model",
    "is not available yet . in this paper",
    "we use the numerical method to analyze why and how the model is able to reproduce a fuller picture of the internet than it was designed for . in other words",
    ", we aim to investigate the exact origin of each of the topology properties captured by the pfp model .",
    "answers to these questions can be valuable for the ongoing effort on a mathematical solution of the model .    in section",
    "ii , we review the pfp model and its two mechanisms .",
    "we reflect on the intuitions underlying the design of the two evolution mechanisms . in section iii",
    ", we comparatively examine two limiting cases of the pfp model .",
    "based on detailed numerical simulations , we identify the explicit evolution dynamics that are responsible for generating the rich - club phenomenon and the degree distribution properties .",
    "we also reveal that the origin of the disassortative mixing is in fact already embedded in the model s two evolution mechanisms .",
    "furthermore we explain that the pfp model resembles the internet s shortest path length and short cycles because these two characteristics are correlated with other topology properties .    in section iv ,",
    "the above results become more evident when we examine how the pfp model s topology properties react to the change of the parameters that control the model s evolution mechanisms .",
    "our investigation leads to a number of insightful discoveries .",
    "for example we find out that the rich - club connectivity is almost exclusively determined by the interactive growth mechanism .",
    "we also show that the interactive growth and the positive - feedback preference jointly contribute to the model s disassortative mixing behavior , however the two mechanisms have opposite effects on the degree distribution s power - law exponent .    in section v we conclude that this work represents a fuller and deeper understanding of the internet topology evolution dynamics .",
    "this work complements the research on evolution mechanisms and structural constrains of complex networks in general .",
    "in graph theory , degree ,  @xmath0 , is defined as the number of links a node has .",
    "degree is a local property but the distribution of degree provides a global view of a network structure .",
    "the degree distribution of the internet as - level topology is characterized by a power - law  @xcite as @xmath1 a power - law degree distribution means the majority of nodes that form a network have very few links .",
    "some nodes , however , are very well connected .",
    "barabsi and albert ( ba )  @xcite showed that a power - law degree distribution can arise from two generic mechanisms : _ growth _ , where a network `` grows '' from a small random network by attaching new nodes to @xmath2 old nodes in the existing system ( see fig.[fig : growth]a , in which @xmath3 ) ; and _ preferential attachment _ , where a new node is attached preferentially to nodes that are already well connected .",
    "the probability that a new node will be connected to a node with degree @xmath0 is given as @xmath4    during the last few years a large number of models have been proposed to resemble and explain the power - law degree distribution and other topology properties observed on various real networks  @xcite .",
    "recently zhou and mondragn  @xcite introduced the positive - feedback preference ( pfp ) model .",
    "numerical evaluation has shown that the pfp model accurately reproduces a large number of characteristics of the internet as - level topology .",
    "the model uses the following two evolution mechanisms .",
    "the interactive growth is designed to satisfy a number of observations on internet history data@xcite .",
    "firstly the internet evolution is largely due to two processes : the attachment of new nodes to the existing system , and the addition of new internal links between old nodes already present in the existing system .",
    "secondly the majority of new nodes appeared on the internet are each attached to no more than two old nodes . and",
    "thirdly the ratio of links to nodes on the internet as graph is approximately three .",
    "different from the independent growth  @xcite ( see fig.[fig : growth]b ) , in which new nodes and new internal links are added independently , the two evolution processes are interdependent in the interactive growth ( see fig.[fig : growth]c and d ) .",
    "that is to say , a new internal link always starts from an old node , we call it a _ host _ node , to whom a new node has just attached .",
    "a heuristic explanation of this interaction is that on the internet , new customers ( new nodes ) generate extra demand for service , which triggers their service providers ( host nodes ) to develop new connections to other service providers ( new internal links ) in order to accommodate the increased traffic and improve services .",
    "the interactive growth is described as such : starting from a small random graph , at each time step ,    * with probability @xmath5 $ ] , a new node is attached to a _",
    "node , and at the same time two new internal links are added connecting the host node to two other old nodes ( see fig.[fig : growth]c ) ; * with probability @xmath6 , a new node is attached to two host nodes , and only one new internal link is added connecting one of the host nodes to another old node ( see fig.[fig : growth]d ) .",
    "numerical simulation shows that when the probability parameter @xmath7 , the interactive growth produces the best result .",
    "the pfp model uses the following nonlinear preference probability to choose old nodes for the interactive growth , @xmath8 it is called the positive - feedback preference ( pfp ) because a node s ability of acquiring new links increases as a feed - back loop of the node s degree . when the parameter @xmath9 , it is equivalent to the ba model s linear preference ( see eq.[eq : ba ] ) .",
    "numerical simulation shows that the positive - feedback preference produces the best result when the parameter @xmath10   of the positive - feedback preference . accordingly the value of parameter @xmath11 is revised as  @xmath12 . ] .",
    "the positive - feedback preference is designed to satisfy the observation  @xcite that during the internet evolution , the probability that a new node links with a low - degree node follows the ba model s linear preference , whereas high - degree nodes have a stronger ability of acquiring new links than predicted by the linear preference .",
    "a preference probability can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a degree function .",
    "the exponential preference  @xcite , which uses the nonlinear degree function of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , also gives high - degree nodes a stronger preference than the linear preference .",
    "however as shown in fig.[fig : degreefunctions ] , only the pfp can be approximated by the linear preference for low - degree nodes .",
    "when degree increases , the pfp grows more and more rapidly and finally exceeds the exponential preference .",
    ".preference probability ratio @xmath17 when @xmath18 and @xmath19 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ table : parameter - delta ] and fig.[fig : parameter - delta ] show how topology properties of the pfp model change when the positive - feedback parameter @xmath11 increases from 0 to 0.035 while the interactive growth parameter @xmath7 .",
    "it is clear that the positive - feedback parameter @xmath11 has a fairly limited impact on the obtained rich - club exponent @xmath20 , which almost remains the same .",
    "when @xmath11 increases , greater preference is given to high - degree nodes , consequently the maximum degree increases and the network becomes more disassortative mixed .",
    "as expected , the characteristic path length decreases steadily when the network s disassortative mixing is getting stronger",
    ". when the parameter @xmath11 increases , the degree distribution power - law exponent @xmath21 slightly decreases .",
    "this is because when the positive - feedback preference gets stronger , the richest nodes attract so many new links that they suppress the degree growth of other nodes , including those with medium to high degrees .",
    "when @xmath10 ( and @xmath7 ) , the pfp model closely matches all the topology properties of the internet as graph .    as shown in fig.[fig : parameter - delta ] , by tuning the parameter @xmath11 from 0 to 0.028 , the pfp model is capable of generating a wide range of disassortative mixing networks with the value of the assortativity coefficient @xmath22 decreasing monotonically from -0.12 to -0.28 , which encompasses most technological and biological networks reported in  @xcite .",
    "notably , the pfp model achieves this while keeping the rich - club exponent and the degree distribution exponent largely unchanged .",
    "@xmath23 is the model s tipping point , beyond which the network structure changes dramatically , e.g.  the degree distribution exponent @xmath21 decreases rapidly .",
    "this is because the preferential selection becomes so biased that super - rich nodes start to emerge .",
    "these extremely rich nodes dominate the network growth and make the network grow towards a star - like structure .",
    "fig.[fig : parameter - theta][fig : parameter - alpha ] are contour plots showing how three topology properties , i.e.  the rich - club connectivity exponent @xmath20 , the degree distribution exponent @xmath21 and the assortativity coefficient @xmath22 , change when both the parameters are variables .",
    "fig.[fig : parameter - theta ] clearly shows that the value of rich - club exponent @xmath20 is sensitive to the interactive growth parameter @xmath24 and is unsensitive to the positive - feedback preference parameter @xmath11 .",
    "when parameter @xmath24 grows , the rich - club phenomenon becomes stronger .",
    "fig.[fig : parameter - gamma ] shows that the two mechanisms have opposite effects on the value of degree distribution exponent @xmath21 .",
    "in general , the exponent @xmath21 increases when parameter @xmath24 increases and parameter @xmath11 decreases .",
    "fig.[fig : parameter - alpha ] shows that the pfp model s disassortative mixing becomes stronger when either of the two parameters increases .",
    "the assortativity coefficient @xmath22 is more sensitive to parameter @xmath11 than to parameter  @xmath24 .",
    "we notice that when @xmath25 , the network s disassortative mixing actually becomes weaker .",
    "this is because , when @xmath25 , the network starts to acquire more internal links than external links , i.e.  @xmath26 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : link - ratio ] ) .",
    "the increased new internal links among the rich nodes weaken the disassortative mixing behavior of the network .",
    "the internet has an extremely complex structure .",
    "the pfp model demonstrates a way to simultaneously reproduce many topology properties of the internet .",
    "the model achieves this by using two generic algorithms which are designed to replicate the evolution dynamics observed on the internet historic data . in this paper",
    "we have used the numerical method to investigate the success of the model .    based on detailed simulation results ,",
    "we show that the rich - club phenomenon is primarily controlled by the interactive growth mechanism alone .",
    "we point out that this is because the rich - club connectivity increases with the number of new internal links which are added between rich nodes .",
    "the interactive growth also determines the probability of new nodes initial degrees and thus controls the distribution of low degrees obtained in the generated network .",
    "the pfp model s maximum degree is as large as the internet because both the interactive growth and the positive - feedback preference accelerate the degree growth rate .",
    "the interactive growth does so by the degree - leap effect , whereas the positive - feedback preference achieves so by giving stronger preference to high - degree nodes .",
    "the two mechanisms have opposite effects on the value of power - law exponent of degree distribution .",
    "the interactive growth increases the value whereas the positive - feedback preference slightly decreases the value .",
    "we have explained that the origin of the disassortative mixing has been , unintentionally , embedded in the pfp model s two evolution mechanisms , which not only enlarge the gap between the high - degree nodes and the low - degree nodes , but more critically , they increase the degree difference between end nodes of a link .",
    "our analysis suggests that the reason that the pfp model also captures other properties of the internet , such as shortest path length and triangle coefficient , is that these properties are correlated with other properties , in other words , they are constrained by other .",
    "for example the internet is small because the rich - club functions as a super traffic hub , while the disassortative mixing behavior ensures peripheral low - degree nodes always close to the hub .    by investigating the pfp model s sensitivity to the mechanism parameters , we obtain more evident details on how the two evolution mechanisms profoundly control the model s growth dynamics and therefore effectively change the generated topology properties .",
    "for example we show that by tuning the positive - feedback parameter @xmath11 , the pfp model is able to generate a wide range of disassortative mixing networks while keeping the rich - club exponent and the degree distribution exponent almost unchanged .",
    "this work represents a better understanding of the internet topology evolution dynamics .",
    "it facilitates the ongoing effort on a mathematical analysis of the pfp model .",
    "this work also complements the research on the evolution dynamics and the structural constrains of complex networks in general ."
