    "most precision measurements of electroweak parameters agree quite well with the predictions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "these experiments rule out many possibilities for physics beyond the standard model , but they have not touched supersymmetry , which evades precision constraints because it decouples from standard - model physics if the scale of supersymmetry breaking is more than a few hundred gev .",
    "definitive tests of supersymmetry will probably have to wait for direct searches at future colliders .",
    "once supersymmetry is discovered , a host of new questions arise .",
    "for example , one would like to test the low energy supersymmetric relations between the particle masses and couplings by making precision measurements of the supersymmetric parameters .",
    "one would like to measure the supersymmetric masses as accurately as possible to shed light on the origin of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "furthermore , one would also like to know whether weak - scale supersymmetry sheds any light on physics at even higher energies .",
    "indeed , the successful unification of gauge couplings encourages hope that other supersymmetric parameters might unify as well .",
    "it is important to measure these parameters precisely at low energies so that they can be extrapolated with confidence to higher energies .",
    "it is in this spirit that we present our calculation of one - loop corrections to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we define the mssm to be the minimally supersymmetrized standard model , with no right handed neutrinos , and all possible soft - breaking terms .",
    "we believe that this minimal model provides an appropriate framework for analyzing the phenomenology of supersymmetry and supersymmetric unification .",
    "we approach our calculation in the standard fashion associated with precision electroweak measurements .",
    "we take as inputs the electromagnetic coupling at zero momentum , @xmath2 , the fermi constant , @xmath3 gev@xmath4 , the @xmath5-boson pole mass , @xmath6 gev , the strong coupling in the scheme at the scale @xmath7 , @xmath8 , as well as the quark and lepton masses , @xmath9 gev , @xmath10 gev , and @xmath11 gev @xcite .    from these inputs , for any tree - level supersymmetric spectrum , we compute the one - loop @xmath0-boson pole mass , @xmath12 , as well as the one - loop values of the effective weak mixing angle , @xmath13 , and the @xcite weak mixing angle , @xmath14 . we also compute the one - loop corrections to the quark and lepton yukawa couplings , as well as the masses of all the supersymmetric and higgs particles .",

    "the logarithmic corrections can be absorbed by changes in the scale @xmath17 .",
    "therefore we checked our logarithmic results against the one - loop supersymmetric renormalization group equations .",

    "while some of these results are not new ( the gauge - boson @xcite , higgs - boson @xcite and gluino @xcite self - energies and the gauge - coupling corrections @xcite already appear in the literature ) , we include the full set of corrections in order to provide a complete , self - contained and more useful reference .    in appendix",
    "a we write the tree - level masses in terms of the parameters of the mssm , and in appendix b we define the passarino - veltman functions that we use to present our one - loop results . in appendix c",
    "we compute the one - loop radiative corrections to the gauge couplings of the mssm , and in appendix d we write the one - loop corrections to the masses .",
    "where appropriate , we evaluate the corrections to the mass _ matrices _ to account for full one - loop superparticle mixing .",
    "this allows for an accurate determination of the masses and mixing through the entire parameter space .",
    "finally , in appendix e we discuss the radiative corrections to the higgs boson masses .",
    "the results in the appendices hold for the mssm with the most general pattern of ( flavor diagonal ) soft supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the parameter space is huge because of the large number of operators that softly break supersymmetry .",
    "therefore in the body of the paper we illustrate our results in a reduced parameter space , obtained by assuming that the soft breaking parameters unify at some high scale .",
    "the unification assumption is useful because it reduces the size of the parameter space .",
    "moreover , it implies certain mass relations that can be tested once supersymmetry is discovered .",
    "in addition , for any set of parameters , it allows us to determine the unification scale thresholds that are necessary to achieve unification .",
    "as we will see , the present set of precision measurements is sufficient to begin to constrain the physics at the unification scale .",
    "we implement the unification assumption by solving the two - loop supersymmetric renormalization group equations subject to two - sided boundary conditions . at the weak scale , we assume a supersymmetric spectrum , and for a given value of the ratio of vacuum expectation values , @xmath19 , we use our one - loop corrections to extract the couplings @xmath20 , and @xmath21 at the scale @xmath7 .",
    "we then use the two - loop renormalization group equations @xcite to run these six parameters to the scale @xmath22 , which we define to be the scale where @xmath23 and @xmath24 meet .",
    "we require that the soft breaking parameters unify at the scale @xmath22 .",
    "therefore at @xmath22 we fix a universal scalar mass , @xmath25 , a universal gaugino mass , @xmath26 , and a universal trilinear scalar coupling , @xmath27 .",
    "we then run all the soft parameters back down to the scale @xmath28 , where we calculate the supersymmetric spectrum using the full one - loop threshold corrections that we present in this paper . in section 4",
    "we show that this scale is essentially the scale of the squark masses , and that the other scalar masses and the higgsino mass are correlated with it as well .",
    "we require radiative electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , so the cp - odd higgs mass , @xmath29 , and the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter , @xmath30 , are determined in a full one - loop calculation at the scale @xmath31 .",
    "the sign of @xmath32 is left undetermined .",
    "we then iterate the entire procedure to determine a self - consistent solution .",
    "typically , convergence to an accuracy of better than @xmath33 is achieved after four iterations .",
    "once we have a consistent solution , we use the results of the appendices to illustrate the one - loop corrections in the reduced parameter space associated with unification .",
    "we display results for a randomly chosen sample of 4000 points .",
    "our sample is chosen with a logarithmic measure in the range @xmath34 , @xmath35 gev , @xmath36 gev , and with a linear measure in the range @xmath37 ( the upper limits on @xmath25 and @xmath26 are chosen so that the squark masses are less than about 1 tev . while larger squark masses are certainly possible , they reintroduce the fine tunings that supersymmetry is designed to avoid . )",
    "each of these points corresponds to a ( local ) minimum of the one - loop scalar potential with the correct electroweak symmetry breaking , and each passes a series of phenomenological constraints : we require the first- and second - generation squark masses to be larger than 220 gev @xcite , the gluino mass to be greater than 170 gev @xcite , the light higgs mass to be greater than 60 gev @xcite , the slepton masses to be greater than 45 gev @xcite , and the chargino masses to be greater than 65 gev @xcite . we also require all the yukawa couplings to remain perturbative ( @xmath38 ) up to the unification scale , and since we assume that @xmath39-parity is unbroken , we enforce the cosmological requirement that the lightest supersymmetric particle be neutral .",

    "the approximations consist of two parts .",
    "first we identify the most important contributions to the one - loop corrections . in most cases",

    "we illustrate the different contributions and present approximations which hold to a few percent .",
    "we also examine yukawa unification and demonstrate the size of the unification - scale yukawa thresholds . in section 4 we present our results for the radiative corrections to the supersymmetric and higgs boson particle masses .",

    "global fits to precision data in the mssm have been performed by several groups @xcite . in this section",
