    "the multi - moment concept underlying the cip method ( cubic - interpolated pseudo - particle or constrained interpolation profile)@xcite provides a general methodology to construct numerical schemes with great flexibility .",
    "one of the major outcome from the practice so far to implement the multi - moments in computational fluid dynamics is that we can build high order schemes on a relatively compact grid stencil using multi - moments , and these moments can be carried forward in time separately by completely different numerical approaches .",
    "some schemes have been developed for practical use based on via and sia ( surface - integrated average ) @xcite@xcite and on via and pv ( point value ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "the later is much more suitable for unstructured or other complex computational grids where a point - wise local riemann problem can be posed at any specified point to update the pv .",
    "it is found that increasing the number of the pvs is a simple way to get higher order schemes .",
    "we have devised and verified the schemes up to 4th order on 2d triangular unstructured grid for both scalar and system conservation laws by employing both via and pv moments . on the other hand , making use of the first derivative at the cell boundary as another moment has been ever used in the so - called cip - csl4(cip - conservative semi - lagrangian with 4th order polynomial ) advection scheme @xcite .",
    "we in this paper explore further the possibility to construct conservative cip / multi - moment formulation of arbitrary order over single cell using more derivative moments . the spatial reconstruction based on multi - moments",
    "is described in section 2 .",
    "the numerical formulation for scalar hyperbolic conservation law is presented in section 3 .",
    "the extension to euler equations is discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 ends the paper with a few conclusion remarks .",
    "the essential point in high resolution scheme is how to reconstruct the interpolation function to find the numerical flux at the boundary of each grid cell . among the most",
    "widely used are , for example , the muscl scheme @xcite , the eno scheme@xcite and the weno scheme @xcite . in all of these schemes",
    "the interpolation is based only on the cell - averaged values of the physical field to be reconstructed . in this section ,",
    "we describe a numerical interpolation that makes use of not only the volume - integrated average over each mesh cell but also the derivatives at the cell boundary .",
    "we call the present formulation the `` multi - moment '' reconstruction to distinguish it from the aforementioned ones which should be more properly refer to as the `` single - moment '' reconstruction .",
    "we consider a physical field variable @xmath0 over a one - dimensional domain divided into control volumes ( mesh cells ) @xmath1 $ ] ; @xmath2 .",
    "there is a flexibility in choosing the discretised moments for field variable @xmath3 .",
    "the primary moment of the finite volume method is the volume - integrated average ( via ) over each mesh cell @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the spatial derivatives up to @xmath6th order at cell boundary @xmath7 are also used as the moments . note that the point value ( pv ) @xmath8 is actually equivalent to the @xmath9th derivative moment @xmath10 .",
    "we will denote the @xmath11th derivative of @xmath12 in respect to any variable @xmath13 , @xmath14 , by @xmath15 occasionally hereafter .",
    "given one via @xmath16 and @xmath17 derivative moments @xmath18 over @xmath1 $ ] , as well as the first - order derivative or gradient @xmath19 that is computed in terms of other independent moments , we can construct a @xmath20$]th order cell - wise polynomial @xmath21 with @xmath22 constrained conditions as follows , @xmath23    thus , the piecewise interpolation polynomial , @xmath24 is constructed over cell @xmath25 . all the coefficients @xmath26 can be uniquely computed from ( [ constraint1]),([constraint2]),([constraint3 ] ) and ( [ constraint4 ] ) .          [ fig:1 ]    the first - order derivative or gradient of the interpolation function @xmath19 can be approximated in terms of the known moments .",
    "for example , a @xmath20$]th order polynomial is obtained if we specify @xmath27 with @xmath28 is computed from constraint conditions ( [ constraint1 ] ) , ( [ constraint2 ] ) and ( [ constraint3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , a slope limiting can be imposed to @xmath19 to suppress the numerical oscillation ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we used a single - cell minmod limiter in this paper .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    it is obvious that the reconstruction discussed above can have a @xmath17th order accuracy for smooth solutions .",
    "in this section , we consider the scalar conservative law as follows , @xmath29 where @xmath12 is the scalar state variable and @xmath30 is the flux function . assuming the hyperbolicity , we have a real characteristic velocity , @xmath31 .",
    "the governing equations for the derivative moments can be directly derived from ( [ scalar - eq ] ) as , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the numerical flux function consistent to @xmath34 .",
    "it is observed from the reconstruction that the derivatives moments up to the @xmath6th order @xmath35 and flux @xmath36 are continuous .",
    "thus , we can update the derivative moments @xmath37 for @xmath38 by ( [ dv - eq1 ] ) with the spatial derivatives of the flux function @xmath39 directly computed from the derivative moments that readily defined and computed at the cell interface as @xmath40    when one advances the highest order derivative moment @xmath41 , @xmath42 is required , which , however , might not be continuous at the cell boundaries .",
    "we make use the the simple lax - friedrichs splitting in terms of the spatial derivatives of the flux function and the state variable as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the largest value of the characteristic speed in the related region .",
    "the state variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 are computed from the multi - moment reconstructions ( [ interpol ] ) separately built for cells @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath47 $ ] , i.e. @xmath48 the corresponding @xmath49 derivatives are @xmath50    it should be noted that we have used an assumption similar to @xcite@xcite@xcite in getting a homogeneous and linearized riemann problem for spatial derivatives for the state variable .    in order to update the via moment ,",
    "we integrate ( [ scalar - eq ] ) over @xmath1 $ ] , yielding the following conservative formulation , @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the numerical flux at cell boundary , and is computed directly from the derivative moments readily updated at the cell boundaries .    the semi - discretized time evolution equations ( 9 ) and ( [ eq : fvm ] ) are predicted in time by a tvd@xcite or a 4th order runge - kutta method . at every substep , we first update the derivative moments by ( 9 ) , and then use these updated moments to evaluate the flux function in ( [ eq : fvm ] ) .",
    "we computed an advected harmonic wave with a wavelength of @xmath53 .",
    "fig.1 shows the results for reconstructions using derivatives moments up to different orders .",
    "it is found that even a short wave can be adequately resolve if higher order derivative moments are used .",
    "fig.2 reveals the effect of limiting .",
    "the numerical oscillation associating discontinuities are eliminated by the slope switching that is also constructed within a single mesh element .",
    "in this section , the numerical formulation presented above is implemented to the inviscid euler conservation laws .",
    "the conservative form of the one - dimensional euler equations is written as follows , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the vector of conservative variables and @xmath56 is the vector of inviscid fluxes . denoted by @xmath57 is the density , @xmath58 the velocity , @xmath59 the total energy and @xmath60 the pressure that is obtained by the equation of state for the perfect gas @xmath61 . the ratio of the specific heats @xmath62 is specified as 1.4 in this paper .    the volume - integrated average ( via ) moment over mesh cell @xmath25 , @xmath63 and the derivative moments up to @xmath6th order at cell boundary , @xmath64 are treated as the model variables .     separately computed by the multi - moment reconstructions with @xmath65 and the 5th - order weno scheme",
    "are plotted .",
    ", width=377 ]    analogous to the scalar case , the governing equations for the derivative moments are derived from ( [ eq : euler_1d ] ) as , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the vector of the numerical flux function consistent to @xmath56 .",
    "given @xmath68 continuous for @xmath69 , we can update the derivative moments @xmath70 for @xmath38 by ( [ dv - eq2 ] ) with the spatial derivatives of the flux function @xmath71 evaluated directly from @xmath72    similar to the scalar case , @xmath73 might be not continuous at the cell boundaries .",
    "so , the highest order derivative moment @xmath74 has to be solved from a riemann problem in terms of the spatial derivative . to this end",
    ", we use the linearization assumption in @xcite@xcite and write the @xmath49th spatial derivative of the flux function as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the jacobian matrix .    the conventional flux splitting algorithms can be adopted here in terms of the spatial derivative quantities .",
    "the @xmath49th derivatives of the state variables and the flux function at the cell interface are computed from the multi - moment reconstructions separately built over two neighboring cells as ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) component - wisely in terms of the the state variables or characteristic variables .",
    "the vias of the conservative variables @xmath55 on cell @xmath25 are updated by integrating ( [ eq : euler_1d ] ) over @xmath1 $ ] , which results in a finite volume formulation , @xmath77 given the derivative moments @xmath68 at cell boundaries , the numerical fluxes @xmath78 in the above equation are directly found .    again , the runge - kutta method is used for time integration for all moments .",
    "a 1d shock tube test@xcite was computed to verify the present method for euler conservation laws .",
    "we include the numerical result of the 5th - order weno scheme@xcite as well for comparison .",
    "shown in fig.3 , the numerical results of the present scheme with different orders are quite competitive .",
    "the close - up plots for shock and contact discontinuity are given in fig.4 .",
    "both linear and non - linear discontinuities are well resolved with correct locations .",
    "it is observed that better resolution can be obtained by simply increasing the order of the derivative moments .",
    "a formulation that uses high order derivative moments has been suggested and tested .",
    "given all the derivative moments that are continuous at cell boundaries and updated separately , the resulting numerical formulation is still single - cell based and quite computationally efficient . in case that the derivative moments are defined and continuous at the cell boundary , the numerical fluxes can be computed directly as in the ido scheme @xcite , while for the spatial derivative higher than the continuous one , we simplify and cast it into a linearized derivative riemann problem@xcite .",
    "the present formulation is substantially different from the ader method@xcite@xcite @xcite where all the derivatives are discontinuous at cell boundaries , thus is more efficient .",
    "our numerical results show that the resolution of the scheme can be improved by simply increasing the order of the derivative moments involved . with the simple slope limiting@xcite , the numerical oscillation around the large gradient can be effectively suppressed .",
