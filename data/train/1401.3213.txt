    "recent 2d spectroscopy studies of photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes @xcite have shown the evidence of coherent dynamics which may play a role in energy transfer processes .",
    "these results sparked numerous debates whether the coherent system dynamics are related to the observed high efficiency and speed of the excitation energy transfer in such systems @xcite .",
    "persistance of the coherent beats over picosecond and their robustness contradict with predictions using conventional exciton relaxation theory based on markovian redfield equation @xcite .",
    "possible vibronic contribution into some of these beats has been proposed in a number of recent studies resulting in complex behavior of the excitonic / vibronic 2d spectra @xcite .",
    "although long lasting beats in photosynthetic complexes reported by raman spectroscopy measurements are well known for a long time @xcite , the raman experiments only provide information about the ground state molecular .",
    "however , the coherent beats observed by 2d spectroscopy have contributions from the electronic excited states and hence the origin of the beats becomes obscure even in a such well - studied photosynthetic complex as fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments and theoretical studies has been recently acomplished to disentangle the electronic / vibrational origin of these beats in simple systems @xcite .    the strong interaction of molecular systems to environment greatly increases the difficulty to theoretically describe the dynamics of the systems because the environment has an infinite number of degrees of freedom . without the environment",
    "no such phenomena as relaxation or energy transfer would be possible since only the macroscopic size of the environment ensures truly irreversible dynamics of the system .",
    "the most general way to calculate the quantum system dynamics is firstly to solve the problem of the evolution of the whole closed quantum system s+b , which can be described by its density operator @xmath0 , and then to calculate the needed observables of the system s. if the hamiltonian @xmath1 characterizes this composite system , its exact evolution in time is governed by the liouville equation for the full density operator @xmath0 :    @xmath2.\\label{eq : liouv eq}\\ ] ]    unfortunately practically it is not possible to solve it directly .",
    "therefore approximate methods which reduce the complexity of the open quantum system are welcome @xcite .",
    "usually we are interested only in the dynamics of the system s which we can describe using the reduced density operator @xmath3 .",
    "it can be obtained by averaging over the environmental degrees of freedom , i. e. , performing the trace operation @xmath4.\\label{eq : red dens op}\\ ] ] second order perturbation theory with respect to system - bath interaction leads to the redfield equation for the reduced density operator of the system @xcite .",
    "the redfield approach is sufficiently accurate and computationally effective for rather large systems which interact weakly with the environment .",
    "the closely related lindblad equation @xcite method has the advantage of preserving the trace of the system reduced density operator .",
    "the lindblad equation can describe the system dynamics at approximately the same level as redfield equation @xcite .",
    "time - adaptive density matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) @xcite , hierarchical equations of motion ( heom ) @xcite allow to incorporate the influence of the heat bath on the system non - perturbatively .",
    "the heom method is formally exact for certain types of environments , thus in principle it does not have restrictions on the values of system parameters or system - bath coupling strength . however in practice heom is computationally very costly , therefore its application is limited only to small systems at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "the t - dmrg approach utilizes a unitary transformation of the whole composite system into a linear 1d nearest - neighbor model .",
    "it is formally exact and allows the usage of an arbitrary environmental spectral density but it can not include correlations between fluctuations of different molecules , which may be important in spectroscopy @xcite . an iterative linearized density matrix ( ildm ) stochastic approach propagates the density matrix using the path integral technique for the environment @xcite .",
    "formally path integral is exact approach as well , however a simplified version of ildm allows its practical application .",
    "all the methods relying on the calculation of the reduced density operator share a common property which allows only the investigation of the statistically averaged behavior of the system s. however , in this case the information about the instantaneous dynamic characteristics of the system is lost .",
    "to investigate them the wavefunction description of the system is preferrable .",
    "one of the approximate approaches for the wavefunction is based on the smart guess of parametrized wavefunction ( so - called ansatz ) .",
    "a variational method is then used to determine equations of motion for the wavefunction parameters @xcite for the wavefunction to approximately satisfy the schrdinger equation with . however",
    ", the solution is restricted to the specific domain of the ansatz .",
    "alternative approaches for the wavefunction can be classified as quantum jump methods and quantum state diffusion methods .",
    "the quantum jump methods are based on a deterministic evolution of the system wave vector with random jumps of the system state , e. g. , surface hopping when some vibrational adiabatic coordinate is explicitly included @xcite and they govern the jump rates , or where jumps are realized by explicit jump operators ( so - called quantum monte - carlo approach ) @xcite .",
    "quantum state diffusion methods propagate the system wave vector under the influence of continuous fluctuations which represent the action of the environment @xcite .",
    "in this paper we apply the stochastic approach to study the excitation transfer times in molecular aggregates .",
    "their histograms provide information on excitation transport pathways .",

    "this wave vector @xmath26 of the composite system encodes the full information about the evolution of both the environment and the system .",

    "first , the exact boltzmann equilibrium values for the populations with respect to the level splittings of 100 @xmath172 can be obtained only when there is no interaction between the system and the bath .",

    "this transfer time is the stochastic property , being unique for each member of the ensemblel .",
    "moreover this transfer time is a stochastic property even for a single member of the ensemble . from the theory of stochastic markovian systems",
    "@xcite it is known that the actual transfer time from the initial state to the final one , when the process is characterized by a single rate constant , must be a random number distributed according to the exponential law with the properly defined mean transfer time , that is the inverse of the rate , i. e. @xmath173 . consequently the mean transfer time is given by @xmath174 .",
    "hence , using the fgr ( or the redfield theory ) , the mean transfer time can be evaluated as the inverse of calculated transfer rates . however , the redfield theory as well as the rate concepts are valid only for the weak coupling regimes . in the case of intermediate or strong couplings , the heom method allows to exactly propagate the density matrix , however , the rates and the transfer times then become undefined .",
    "additional heuristic arguments may be necessary to define the transfer times based on the density matrix population evolutions .",
    "we next devise a stochastic method to simulate the excitation transfer time using the sse , which allows to properly define and evaluate the excitation _ transfer time distribution function _ even if it is not exponential .",
    "the meaning of the transfer time implies that we start with the predefined state of the system and after some time we observe another state .",
    "hence , to calculate the transfer time to an arbitrary site of the system , first we have to define the process of the measurement ( detection ) of the excitation on the necessary site .",
    "this measurement procedure can be constructed in the following way .",
    "the system wave vector with components @xmath175 is a stochastic variable depending on a set of fluctuations @xmath176 according to eq . .",

    "<S> we derive the stochastic schrdinger equation for the system wave vector and use it to describe the excitation energy transfer dynamics in molecular aggregates . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a quantum - measurement based method of estimating the excitation transfer time . </S>",
    "<S> adequacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated by performing calculations on a model system . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is then applied to study the excitation transfer dynamics in a photosynthetic pigment - protein fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) aggregate using both the debye spectral density and the spectral density obtained from earlier molecular dynamics simulations containing strong vibrational high - frequency modes . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results show that the excitation transfer times in the fmo system are affected by the presence of the vibrational modes , however the transfer pathways remain the same . </S>"
