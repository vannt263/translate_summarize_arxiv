    "the abell richness class 0 cluster a2597 ( abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ) at a redshift of @xmath12 is elliptical but quite regular in its galaxy and gas distributions ( e.g. , trvese et al .",
    "1992b ; buote & tsai 1996 ) , with an elongated cd galaxy at its center ( mcnamara & oconnell 1993 ) .",
    "this central galaxy in a2597 contains the moderately luminous ( @xmath13 w / hz ) radio source pks  2322 - 122 ( owen , white , & burns 1992 ; ball , burns , & loken 1993 ) .",
    "recent radio observations show that this very small source ( @xmath146 arcsec in diameter ) has emission from a radio core , a strongly bent jet , and two steep spectrum radio lobes on either side of the nucleus ( sarazin et al .  1995b , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "a2597 is a powerful x - ray source with a total luminosity of @xmath15 erg s@xmath6 ( 210 kev ; david et al .",
    "the cluster contains a strong central cooling flow ( crawford et al .",
    "1989 ; paper i ) , with a total cooling rate of @xmath16 300400 @xmath3 yr@xmath6 out to a radius of @xmath17 kpc .",
    "as is often true of strong cooling flows , the central cd galaxy in a2597 has extensive optical and uv line emitting filaments ( hu 1988 ; heckman et al .",
    "1989 ; crawford & fabian 1992 ) . the x - ray emission in the central regions is elongated along a direction which it perpendicular to the orientation of the radio lobes ( paper i ) . similar x - ray ",
    "radio anti - correlations have been seen in a number of other cooling flow clusters ( e.g. , bhringer et al .",
    "1993 ; harris , carilli , & perley 1994 ; sarazin , baum , & odea 1995a ) .    as is also true of the central galaxies in many other cooling flow clusters , the central optical colors of the cd galaxy in a2597 are considerably bluer than a typical giant elliptical galaxy ( crawford & fabian 1992 ; mcnamara & oconnell 1993 ) .",
    "the bluest regions lie in lobe - like structures which extend radially @xmath18 kpc on either side of the i - band nucleus with a ne / sw orientation ( mcnamara & oconnell 1993 ) .",
    "these blue optical lobes appear to be oriented along the axis of the radio jets in the central galaxy ( paper i ) .",
    "the optical lobes could originate from a number of processes .",
    "however , the most plausible on morphological and energetic grounds are radio - lobe - induced star formation or scattered nonthermal radiation beamed anisotropically from the nucleus ( e.g. , paper i ) .",
    "there is also evidence for the presence of dust in the central regions from the optical color distribution in the cd galaxy and from the ratio of h@xmath19/ly@xmath19 line emission ( hu 1992 ; mcnamara & oconnell 1993 ) .    through a re - analysis of @xmath7 solid state spectrometer x - ray spectra of the central regions of cooling flow clusters , white et al .",

    "rosat pspc and asca spectra have confirmed this absorption in a number of clusters ( allen et al .",
    "1993 ; fabian et al .",
    "1994 ) , and the rosat pspc spectral images have shown that the excess absorption is confined to the inner cooling regions of the cluster in several cases ( allen et al .  1993 ; irwin & sarazin 1995 ) . in general , the cold material producing this absorption has not been detected at non  x - ray wavelengths , despite considerable efforts ( e.g. , mcnamara & jaffe 1993 ; antonucci & barvainis 1994 ; odea et al .",

    "the total column is @xmath11 @xmath10 , which is comparable to the columns derived from x - ray spectra of other cluster cooling flows .",
    "the absorber has a component which is extended at least over the rather small diameter of the radio source ( @xmath86 arcsec ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no x - ray  derived absorbing column for this cluster with which to compare the 21 cm detection .",
    "the galactic column toward the cluster is relatively small ( @xmath21 @xmath10 ; stark et al .",

    "the hri results on the inner structure of the cooling flow and its relation to the radio source have already been presented in paper i. in the present paper , we will concentrate on the results from the rosat pspc .",
    "the purpose of these observations was to use the high sensitivity of the pspc to map the large - scale x - ray emission of a2597 and to use the spectral resolution to determine the thermal structure of the cluster .",
    "in addition , the pspc is an ideal instrument for searching for excess soft x - ray absorption , which we can compare to the radio detection of neutral hydrogen and to the excess absorption measurement toward other cooling flow clusters .",

    ", we will concentrate on the pspc data .",
    "we will only discuss the global properties of the hri data which were not addressed in paper i.    the pspc data was screened for periods of high background based on a master veto rate @xmath24 170 ( plucinsky et al .",

    "this image is restricted to the hard band on rosat of 0.4  2.4 kev ( pi channels 42247 ) .",
    "the cluster x - ray emission is quite hard , particularly away from the bright cooling flow region at the center .",
    "restricting the emission to the hard band removes much of the background and emission by other sources , but does not affect the number of photons from the cluster as strongly .",
    "the spectral resolution of the rosat pspc allows the determination of the spectral properties of clusters , at least when the temperature is low or the observation contains a sufficiently large number of photons .",
    "the only published spectral information on a2597 is from the monitor proportional counter ( mpc ) on the @xmath7 observatory , which provided a best - fit temperature of 9.1 kev with a 90% confidence lower limit of 3.8 kev ( david et al .",
    "we analyzed the pspc spectrum of a2597 using the facilities within pros and xspec .",

    "some of the results of the spectral fitting are summarized in table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "all of the errors or upper limits given for spectral parameters are at the 90% confidence level .",
    "first , we determined the global spectrum of the cluster by extracting the counts from a circle of radius 1 mpc ( 7.76 arcmin ) .",
    "the spectrum was corrected for particle and x - ray background using a circular annulus extending from 7.76 to 13.4 arcmin .",
    "the initial model we adopted for the spectrum was a raymond - smith model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) for the thermal emission and the wisconsin model ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) for foreground galactic absorption .",
    "we refer to this as a `` single temperature '' model in table  [ tab : spectra ] and in the following discussion .",
    "the best - fit single temperature model for the whole cluster spectrum had a temperature of @xmath30 kev , a hydrogen column density of @xmath31 @xmath10 , and a cosmic heavy element abundance fraction of @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig : whole_spectrum ] shows the observed x - ray spectrum , the best - fit single temperature model , and the residuals to the fit .",
    "this is a poor fit , with a @xmath29 of 47.88 for 26 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) .",
    "the measured galactic hydrogen column toward a2597 is @xmath21 @xmath10 ( stark et al .",
    "this is slightly larger than the column determined from the pspc spectrum . in the region around a2597 ,",
    "the galactic columns varies by about @xmath33 @xmath10 , and it is likely that there are additional systematic uncertainties at least this large both in the determination of the galactic column and in the x - ray determination of the column density ( for example , pros and xspec give slightly differing values . )",
    "thus , the x - ray and radio determinations of the galactic column are in reasonable agreement if systematic errors are included",
    ". the heavy element abundance is poorly determined , but is similar to the values generally found for x - ray clusters .",
    "the best - fit temperature is incompatible with the temperature derived from the @xmath7 mpc .",
    "david et al .  ( 1993 ) found a best - fit temperature of 9.1 kev with a 90% confidence lower limit of 3.8 kev .",
    "the pspc temperature would also be lower than those typically found for clusters of this x - ray luminosity .",
    "these discrepancies and the poor fit to a single temperature model suggest that the cluster has at least two temperature components in its spectrum",
    ". most of the emission ( particularly on the large scales sampled by the mpc ) would be in a hard component , while a softer component would provide much of the flux in the pspc band .",
    "the residuals in figure  [ fig : whole_spectrum ] are also suggestive of additional soft x - ray emission . a model with two temperatures",
    "does provide an improved fit to the observations .",
    "the lower temperature is @xmath34 kev , while the higher temperature is poorly determined but considerably larger .",
    "previous @xmath7 ipc and rosat hri images have shown that a2597 possesses a cooling flow at the center of the cluster ( crawford et al .",
    "1989 ; paper i ) .",
    "the cooling radius is approximately 100 - 250 kpc .",
    "below , we show that the cooler spectral component is localized to the central regions of the cluster .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to attribute the cooler component in the spectrum of a2597 to this cooling flow , and to model it using the spectrum of gas cooling subject to its own radiation .",
    "a cooling flow spectrum should be reasonably approximated by isobaric cooling .",
    "we therefore added a component to the model with the spectrum of gas cooling isobarically from the ambient cluster gas temperature to a very low temperature . the initial temperature and abundances of this cooling flow component",
    "were assumed to be the same as that of the general intracluster gas .",
    "we refer to this as a `` single temperature plus cooling flow '' model ( table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "this model fit the spectra better than the two temperature model .",
    "4truein    figure  [ fig : whole_cf_spectrum ] shows the best - fit single temperature plus cooling flow model to the spectrum of the entire cluster .",
    "this model provides a considerably improved and acceptable fit to the spectrum of the entire cluster , with @xmath35 for 25 d.o.f .",
    "some of the parameters of this model are given in table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "in this model , the hydrogen column is well - determined , and the emission measure of the hotter gas and the cooling rate in the cooling flow are moderately well - determined .",
    "the temperature of the intracluster gas and its abundances are very poorly determined .",
    "we were only able to derive a lower limit for the gas temperature , and the abundance is practically undetermined ( the errors allow all sensible values ) .",
    "this is not surprising for several reasons .",
    "first , the soft x - ray spectrum of isothermal hot gas depends only weakly on the temperature .",
    "second , the soft x - ray spectrum of isothermal hot gas is nearly independent of the abundances because all of the common elements are fully ionized except iron , and the strong iron lines are at photon energies of about 7 kev .",
    "third , the soft x - ray emission from cooling gas is nearly independent of its initial temperature as long as that temperature is suitably high ( wise & sarazin 1993 ) .",
    "fourth , the x - ray spectrum of cooling gas is roughly independent of the abundances in the gas because increasing the abundances increases both the emissivity and the cooling rate ( e.g. , wise & sarazin 1993 ) .    the cooling rate derived from the spectrum , @xmath5 yr@xmath6 , is in agreement with that derived from analyses of the @xmath7 ipc image ( 370 @xmath3 yr@xmath6 ; crawford et al .",
    "1989 ) and the rosat hri ( 327 @xmath3 yr@xmath6 ; paper i ) .",
    "because of the effect of the cooling flow at the center of the cluster on the overall spectrum , we determined the spectrum for the outer intracluster gas in a2597 at projected radii of 250 kpc to 1 mpc ( table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "the inner radius of 250 kpc was chosen to be larger than the cooling radius as determined by x - ray surface brightness profiles ( crawford et al .",
    "1989 ; paper i ) , and larger than the region where the spatially resolved spectra , described below , require a cooling flow component .",
    "the 90% confidence range for the temperature here ( 2.286.59 kev ) is in better agreement with the temperature from @xmath7 mpc measurement . for the reasons given above",
    ", the abundance is poorly determined at these higher temperatures , and we have only a lower limit of about 0.43 of cosmic .",
    "the single temperature model provided an adequate fit to the outer cluster spectra ( @xmath36 for 26 d.o.f .",

    "these models are shown at the right of table  [ tab : spectra ] . when the cooling flow components to the spectrum are included , the ambient gas temperatures in most of the annuli are poorly constrained .",

    "this is due to the low ambient gas temperature for this region , which means that both of the two spectral components have similarly soft spectra .",

    "this absorption was in addition to the previously determined absorption ( table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "this exaggerates the effect of the radio absorption in several ways .",

    "the broad component has a column density of @xmath85 @xmath10 .",
    "such a column of hydrogen covering the inner 14 arcsec radius of the x - ray emission might be detectable . simply adding this absorption to the model in table  [ tab : spectra ] increases the @xmath29 by 27 .",

    "thus , the x - ray spectra are moderately inconsistent with the broad component having a column density of @xmath85 @xmath10 that uniformly covers the entire region of the emission line nebula ( @xmath88 arcsec ) . a larger region of coverage is certainly ruled out by the upper limit of @xmath89 @xmath10 on the column in the central x - ray spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin temperature may be less than 100 k , the abundance of carbon and oxygen ( which provide a large part of the x - ray absorption ) may be lower than cosmic , or the h  i may be centrally condensed ( as the h@xmath19 emission is observed to be ) and the neutral column from the radio observation may only apply at the center .",

    "we have therefore presented only the v - band data here . although some of the increasing ellipticity with radius seen in the optical band is probably real , the slope and intercept ( central ellipticity and position angle ) may be strongly affected by seeing in the inner several arcsec .",
    "franx , illingworth , & heckman ( 1989 ) showed that optical ellipticities and position angles can be strongly affected ( greater than 10% ) by the width and shape of the instrument psf within about 5 times the seeing @xmath100 .",

    "42247 ) was used to minimize the background contribution ( which is mainly very soft ) compared to cluster emission ( which is expected to be mainly very hard ) . although the x - ray image of the cluster is moderately elliptical (   [ ssec : ellipse ] ) , the use of elliptical annuli with variable ellipticities and/or position angles would make it difficult to deconvolve the gas density from the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "in addition to quantities derivable from the observed surface brightness , one would need to specify the third axis of the ellipsoid , and two additional angles .",

    "because of the longer exposure in the hri , the counts in the central regions of the image are similar , and so the errors in the surface brightness there are similar . at large radii , the lower background in the pspc provides a better determination of the x - ray surface brightness . at intermediate radii ( 14 arcmin ) , the hri and pspc give consistent results . to take advantage of the better resolution of the hri at small radii and the lower background of the pspc at larger radii ,",
    "we have merged the two profiles into a single x - ray surface brightness profile .",

    "the counting rate was converted into a physical flux assuming the best - fit single temperature spectrum for the entire cluster ( table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "however , the adopted spectra have little actual affect on the scaling of hri to pspc counts or the conversion to physical flux .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness profile is shown as the upper points in figure  [ fig : x - ray_surf ] with 1 @xmath83 errors .",
    "we fitted the x - ray surface brightness in figure  [ fig : x - ray_surf ] with the isothermal `` beta '' model , @xmath107^{-3 \\beta + 1/2}$ ] .",

    "as had generally been found with cooling flows clusters ( e.g. , jones & forman 1984 ) , the beta model could not fit the sharply peaked central surface brightness within the cooling radius .",
    "we tried a number of simple models for the cooling flow portion of the x - ray surface brightness profile , but none gave an acceptable fit .",
    "instead , we fit the surface brightness with the beta model , progressively removing the interior points until an acceptable fit was found .",
    "this required the removal of the data points interior to a projected radius of 84 arcsec ( 180 kpc ) .",
    "this is similar to the cooling radius in the cluster ( crawford et al .",
    "1989 ; paper i ) .",
    "with these interior points removed , an acceptable beta model fit was found ( @xmath111 for 14 d.o.f . ) , which gave @xmath0 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "note that this value of @xmath112 is consistent , within the errors , with that found from the unacceptable fit including all of the data points .",
    "this is not surprising , as the value of @xmath112 is mainly constrained by the decline in the x - ray surface brightness at large radii , and the data points at large radii were included in both fits .",

    "again , this upper limit on the core radius includes the value found in the unacceptable fit including all of the data points .",
    "thus , it seems fair to conclude that the centrally peaked x - ray emission due to cooling flow makes it impossible to determine the core radius of the cluster , and that the data only allow an upper limit of @xmath1 arcsec ( 170 kpc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath112 is well - determined , and the behavior of the surface brightness at large radii is consistent with the beta model .",

    "figure  [ fig : x - ray_surf ] does nt show any evidence for this , but our data may not extend to a large enough radius .",
    "the x - ray emissivity of the gas was determined by de - projecting the x - ray surface brightness into spherical shells , each of constant emissivity ( e.g. , arnaud 1988 ) .",
    "the electron density was then determined and is plotted as the lower points in figure  [ fig : x - ray_surf ] .",

    "to determine the gas pressure , we need to know the gas temperature as a function of radius in the cluster . the gas temperature as a function projected radius is shown in figure  [ fig : temperatures ] as derived from the pspc spectra .",
    "it is clear that the errors are very large , and that the temperature is very poorly constrained in the inner points where there is a contribution to the spectrum from a cooling flow .",
    "there is no clear evidence for a radial trend in the temperatures , except for the drop in temperature within the inner 100 kpc .",
    "thus , we have assumed a constant value for the temperature set by the outer cluster spectrum , @xmath117 kev .",
    "the errors in the masses were assessed using monte carlo simulations of the x - ray surface brightness data to determine the 90% confidence region , including the errors on the temperature in each data point individually .",
    "note , however , that the errors for the points are correlated in a complex manner , both because of the de - projection of the surface brightness and of the inclusion of the error in the overall cluster temperature separately in the error in the mass at each radius .",
    "obviously , asca spectra of a2597 would be of great value in determining the temperature profile more accurately .",
    "4truein    for comparison , we also determined the gas and total masses for the best - fit beta - model surface brightness fits for the gas distribution .",
    "we used the best - fit model using all of the surface brightness points , including the central excess emission in the cooling flow .",
    "the resulting mass profiles for the best - fit model are the solid curves in figure  [ fig : masses ] .",
    "the de - projection densities are not corrected for the effects of the finite instrument psf , and this causes the de - projection to give different results than the best - fit beta - model ( which is corrected for the psf ) for the innermost points .",

    "<S> the gas density and accumulated mass were derived as a function of radius , and the hydrostatic equilibrium condition was used to determine the total gravitational mass , also as a function of radius . within a radius of 2 mpc , we found masses of @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath3 , and a gas mass fraction of about 19% . </S>",

    "<S> the rosat pspc x - ray spectrum of the cluster was determined . </S>",
    "<S> both the overall cluster spectrum and the spatially resolved spectra within 300 kpc require the presence of both hot gas and a cooling flow in the spectrum . the spectrally determined total cooling rate of @xmath5 yr@xmath6 is in good agreement with those derived from analyses of the x - ray surface brightness profile from the @xmath7 ipc and the rosat hri images . </S>",
    "<S> the rosat spatially resolved x - ray spectra indicate that the cooling component is distributed over the inner @xmath8300 kpc in radius of the cluster . </S>",
