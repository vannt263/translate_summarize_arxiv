    "experiments to map the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) have stimulated renewed interest in diffuse galactic emission .",
    "sensitive observations of variations in the microwave sky brightness have revealed a component of the 14 - 90 ghz microwave continuum which is correlated with @xmath0 thermal emission from interstellar dust ( kogut et al .",
    "1996 ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1997 ; leitch et al .",
    "the origin of this  anomalous \" emission has been of great interest . while the observed frequency - dependence appears consistent with free - free emission ( kogut et al .",
    "1996 ; leitch et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is difficult to reconcile the observed intensities with free - free emission from interstellar gas ( see  [ sec : freefree ] below ) .    a recent investigation of the rotational dynamics of very small interstellar grains ( draine & lazarian 1998 ; hereinafter dl98 ) leads us instead to propose that this 10 - 100 ghz `` anomalous '' component of the diffuse galactic background is produced by electric dipole rotational emission from very small dust grains under normal interstellar conditions .    below we describe briefly our assumptions concerning the interstellar grain properties (  [ sec : grain_props ] ) , the dynamics governing the rotation of small grains (  [ sec : rotation ] ) , the predicted emission spectrum and intensity (  [ sec : prediction ] ) and how it compares with observations (  [ sec : observations ] ) , and why the observed emission can not be attributed to free - free (  [ sec : freefree ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss implications for future cbr studies .",
    "the observed emission from interstellar diffuse clouds at 12 and 25@xmath1 ( boulanger & prault 1988 ) is believed to be thermal emission from grains which are small enough that absorption of a single photon can raise the grain temperature to @xmath2 for the @xmath3 emission , and @xmath4 for the @xmath5 emission .",
    "such grains contain @xmath6 atoms , and must be sufficiently numerous to account for @xmath720% of the total rate of absorption of energy from starlight .",
    ", a 6 ev photon can heat a particle with n=277 atoms to @xmath8 . ] a substantial fraction of these very small grains may be hydrocarbon molecules , as indicated by emission bands at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath1 observed from diffuse clouds by _",
    "irts _ ( onaka et al .",
    "1996 ) and _ iso _ ( mattila et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "if the grains are primarily carbonaceous , they must contain @xmath9 of the carbon in the interstellar medium [ in the model of dsert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules contain @xmath79% of the carbon ] .",
    "the size distribution is uncertain . as in dl98 , for our standard model",
    "we assume a grain size distribution consisting of a power law @xmath10 ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ; draine & lee 1984 ) plus a log - normal distribution containing 5% of the carbon ; 50% of the mass in the log - normal distribution ( i.e. , 2.5% of the c atoms ) is in grains with @xmath11 atoms .",
    "the grains are assumed to be disk - shaped for @xmath12 , and spherical for @xmath13 .",
    "the microwave emission from a spinning grain depends on the component of the electric dipole moment perpendicular to the angular velocity .",
    "following dl98 , we assume that a neutral grain has a dipole moment @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of atoms in the grain . recognizing that there will be a range of dipole moments for grains of a given @xmath15",
    ", we assume that 25% of the grains have @xmath16 , 50% have @xmath17 , and 25% have @xmath18 . for our standard models",
    "we will take @xmath19 , but since @xmath20 is uncertain we will examine the effects of varying @xmath21 .",
    "if the grain has a charge @xmath22 , then it acquires an additional electric dipole component arising from the fact that the centroid of the grain charge will in general be displaced from the center of mass ( purcell 1979 ) ; we follow dl98 in assuming a characteristic displacement of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the rms distance of the grain surface from the center of mass , and in computing the grain charge distribution @xmath25 including collisional charging and photoelectric emission .",
    "finally we assume that the dipole moment is , on average , uncorrelated with the spin axis , so that the mean - square dipole moment transverse to the spin axis is [ eq : mueff ] _",
    "^2= ( 2/3 ) ( ^2 n + 0.01 z^2e^2a_x^2 )  .",
    "we will show results for 6 different grain models .",
    "models b and c differ from our preferred model a by having @xmath21 decreased or increased by a factor 2 .",
    "model d differs by having twice as many small grains in the log - normal component . in model",
    "e even the smallest grains are spherical , whereas in model f the smallest grains are assumed to be linear .",
    "rotation of small interstellar grains has been discussed previously , including the fact that the rate of rotation of very small grains would be limited by electric dipole emission ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) .",
    "ferrara & dettmar ( 1994 ) recently estimated the rotational emission from very small grains , noting that it could be observable up to @xmath7100 ghz , but they did not self - consistently evaluate the emission spectrum including the effects of radiative damping .",
    "a number of distinct physical processes act to excite and damp rotation of interstellar grains , including collisions with neutral atoms , collisions with ions and long - range interactions with passing ions ( anderson & watson 1993 ) , rotational emission of electric dipole radiation , emission of infrared radiation , formation of @xmath26 molecules on the grain surface , and photoelectric emission .",
    "we use the rates for these processes summarized in dl98 ; the results reported here assume that @xmath26 does _ not _ form on small grains , so that there is no contribution by @xmath26 formation to the rotation . as discussed in dl98 , observed rates of @xmath26 formation on grains",
    "limit the @xmath26 formation torques so that they can make at most a minor contribution to the rotation of the very small grains of interest here .",
    "emission in the 10 - 100 ghz region is dominated by grains containing @xmath27 atoms . for these very small grains under cnm conditions ( see table ) , rotational excitation is dominated by direct collisions with ions and `` plasma drag '' .",
    "the very smallest grains ( @xmath28 ) have their rotation damped primarily by electric dipole emission ; for @xmath29 plasma drag dominates .",
    "following dl98 , we solve for the rms rotation rate @xmath30 , which depends on the local environmental conditions ( density @xmath31 , gas temperature @xmath32 , fractional ionization @xmath33 , and the intensity of the starlight background ) , the grain size , and the assumed value of @xmath20 in eq.([eq : mueff ] ) . then , assuming a maxwellian distribution of angular velocities for each grain size and @xmath20 , we integrate over the size distribution to obtain the emission spectrum for the grain population .",
    "interstellar gas is found in a number of characteristic physical states ( see , e.g. , mckee 1990 ) . by mass ,",
    "most of the gas and dust is found in the `` warm ionized medium '' ( wim ) , `` warm neutral medium '' ( wnm ) , `` cold neutral medium '' ( cnm ) , or in molecular clouds ( mc ) . in the diffuse regions ( wim , wnm , cnm ) the bulk of the dust is heated by the general starlight background to temperatures @xmath34 where it radiates strongly at @xmath35  thus the @xmath0 emission traces the mass of the wim , wnm , and cnm material .",
    "relatively little molecular material is present at @xmath36 where sensitive cbr observations are directed .",
    "hence we consider only the wim , wnm , and cnm phases in the present discussion .    in table 1",
    "we list the assumed properties for each of the interstellar medium components which we consider here . for @xmath37 , @xmath38 observations ( heiles 1976 ) indicate @xmath39 , divided approximately equally between wnm and cnm phases ( dickey , salpeter , & terzian 1978 ) .",
    "dispersion measures toward pulsars in 4 globular clusters ( reynolds 1991 ) indicate an ionized component @xmath40 , after attributing @xmath720% of the electrons to hot ionized gas ( mckee 1990 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : specs ] we show the predicted rotational emissivity per h nucleon , where we have taken the weighted average of emission from cnm , wnm , and wim , according to the mass fractions in table [ tab : phases ] .",
    "the heavy curve is for our preferred grain model a ; the results shown for grain models b - f serve to illustrate the uncertainty in the predicted emission .",
    "all models have the grain emissivity peaking at about @xmath730 ghz ; when the smallest grains are taken to be spheres ( model e ) , the emission peak shifts to @xmath735 ghz because of the reduced moment of inertia of these smallest grains .",
    "in addition to the rotational emission from the very small grains , we expect continuum emission from the vibrational modes of the larger dust grains , which are thermally excited according to the grain vibrational temperature @xmath41 . the vibrational emission per h atom is assumed to vary as @xmath42 .",
    "we show the emissivity for @xmath43 , 1.7 , and 2 ; in each case we adjust @xmath44 and @xmath41 so that @xmath45 peaks at @xmath46 , with a peak emissivity @xmath47 ( wright et al .  1991 ;",
    "5 of draine 1995 ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath48 and @xmath41 are within the range found by reach et al .",
    "we will use @xmath49 to estimate the thermal emissivity ; by comparison with the estimates for @xmath43 and @xmath50 we see that the thermal emission at @xmath7100 ghz is uncertain by at least a factor @xmath51 .",
    "we expect the thermal emission to dominate for @xmath52 ghz , with the rotational emission dominant at lower frequencies .",
    "figure [ fig : speca ] shows the emission per h nucleon for our preferred parameters ( model a , @xmath49 ) , for each phase as well as the weighted average over the three phases . also shown",

    "100@xmath1 maps .",
    "all three papers reported strong positive correlations of microwave emission with 100@xmath1 thermal emission from dust .",
    "the observed correlation of 100@xmath1 emission with 21 cm emission , @xmath53 ( boulanger and prault 1988 ) , allows us to infer the excess microwave emission per h atom , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : speca ] .    while kogut et al .",
    "attribute only @xmath750% of the 90 ghz signal to thermal emission , we estimate that the 90 ghz signal is predominantly vibrational emission from dust .",
    "the rotational emission which we predict appears to be in good agreement with the 30 - 50 ghz measurements by kogut et al .",
    ", de oliveira - costa et al . , and leitch et al .",
    "we conclude that rotational emission from small dust grains accounts for a substantial fraction of the `` anomalous '' galactic emission at 30 - 50 ghz .",
    "leitch et al .",
    "also report excess emission at 14.5 ghz which is correlated with 100@xmath1 emission from dust . for our model",
    "a , rotational emission from dust grains accounts for only @xmath730% of the reported excess emission at 14.5 ghz .",
    "additional emission at 14.5 ghz could be obtained by changes in our adopted parameters : model b , in which dipole moments are increased by a factor of two , would be in good agreement with the 14.5 ghz result of leitch et al . however , the assumed dipole moment is larger than we consider likely , so we do not favor this model .",
    "we could of course also improve agreement by increasing the number of small grains in the size range ( @xmath54 ) primarily radiating near 14.5 ghz .",
    "we note that there may be systematic variations in the small grain population from one region to another .",
    "the signal reported by leitch et al .  at 30 ghz is about a factor of @xmath73 larger than the results of kogut et al .  and de oliveira - costa et al . , both of which average over much larger areas than the observations of leitch et al . additional observations to measure more precisely the galactic emission will be of great value .",
    "we also note that although leitch et al .  found no correlation of 14.5 ghz excess with synchrotron maps at 408 mhz , synchrotron emission and rotational emission from dust are expected to contribute approximately equally to the diffuse background near 14 ghz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : back ] ) .",
    "we conjecture that some of the 100@xmath1-correlated 14.5 ghz radiation observed by leitch et al",
    ".  may be synchrotron emission which is enhanced by increased magnetic field strengths near concentrations of gas and dust .",
    "based on the observed frequency - dependence of the excess radiation , kogut et al .",
    "proposed that it was a combination of thermal emission from dust plus free - free emission from ionized hydrogen .",
    "leitch et al .",
    "reached the same conclusion based on their 14.5 and 32 ghz measurements .",
    "leitch et al .",
    "noted that if the proposed spatially - varying free - free emission originated in gas with @xmath55 , it would be accompanied by h@xmath48 emission at least 60 times stronger than the observed variations in the h@xmath48 sky brightness ( gaustad et al .",
    "1996 ) on the same angular scales .",
    "noting that the ratio of h@xmath48 to free - free radio continuum drops as the gas temperature is increased above @xmath56 , leitch et al .",
    "proposed that the `` anomalous '' emission originated in gas at @xmath57 ,    however , this proposal appears to be untenable . according to leitch et al . , the observed emission excess would require an emission measure @xmath58 with @xmath59 near the north celestial pole ( ncp , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "kogut et al .  and",
    "de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "reported a weaker signal at 30 ghz , corresponding to an emission measure @xmath62 toward the ncp .",
    "the dmr observations ( kogut et al .  1996 ) cover a substantial fraction of the sky , and would imply an emission measure normal to the galactic disk @xmath63 . for @xmath57 the radiative cooling rate can be approximated by @xmath64 ( cf .",
    "bohringer & hensler 1989 ) so the power radiated per disk area would be @xmath65 , far in excess of the @xmath66 energy input for one @xmath67 supernova per 100 yr per 10 kpc radius disk .",
    "evidently the proposed attribution of the `` anomalous emission '' to bremsstrahlung from hot gas can be rejected on energetic grounds .",
    "very small dust grains have been invoked previously to explain the observed 3 - 60@xmath1 emission from interstellar dust ( leger & puget 1984 ; draine & anderson 1985 ; dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ) .",
    "we have calculated the spectrum of rotational emission expected from such dust grains , and shown that it should be detectable in the 10  100 ghz region .",
    "in fact , we argue that this emission has already been detected by kogut et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and leitch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "rotational emission from very small grains and  thermal \" ( i.e. , vibrational ) emission by larger dust grains is an important foreground which will have to be subtracted in future sensitive experiments to measure angular structure in the cbr . to illustrate the relative importance of the emission from dust , in fig .",
    "[ fig : back ] we show the estimated rms variations in galactic emission near the ncp ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , representative of intermediate galactic latitudes .",
    "the hi column density is taken to be @xmath70 ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) , plus an additional column density @xmath71 of wim .",
    "we take 20% as an estimate of the rms variations in column density on angular scales of a few degrees .",
    "we also show the synchrotron background near the ncp , based on a total antenna temperature of @xmath72 at 1.42 ghz ( reich 1982 ) and @xmath73 at higher frequencies . the synchrotron background is smoother than the hi ; we take 5% as an estimate of the rms synchrotron variations on angular scales of a few degrees . from the standpoint of minimizing confusion with non - cbr backgrounds , 70 - 100 ghz appears to be the optimal frequency window .",
    "the `` thermal '' emission originates in larger grains , which are known to be partially aligned with their long axes perpendicular to the local magnetic field ; above 100 ghz most of the emission is thermal , and we estimate that this will be @xmath74 linearly polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field ( dotson 1996 has observed up to 7% polarization at 100@xmath1 toward m17 ) . below @xmath750 ghz",
    "most of the emission is rotational . at this time it is not clear whether the angular momentum vectors of very small dust grains will be aligned with the galactic magnetic field .",
    "ultraviolet observations of interstellar polarization place limits on such alignment ( kim & martin 1995 ) but do not require it to be zero . if the grain angular momenta tend to be aligned with the galactic magnetic field , then the rotational emission will tend to be polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "physical processes which could produce alignment of these small grains will be discussed in future work ( lazarian & draine 1998 ) . even modest ( @xmath71% ) polarization of the dust emission",
    "could interfere with efforts to measure the small polarization of the cbr introduced by cosmological density fluctuations .    according to our model ,",
    "the @xmath75ghz emission and diffuse @xmath5 emission should be correlated , as both originate in grains containing @xmath76 atoms ; future satellite observations of the diffuse background can test this .",
    "future observations by both ground - based experiments and satellites such as _ map _ and _ planck _ will be able to characterize more precisely the intensity and spectrum of emission from interstellar dust grains in the 10 - 200 ghz region .",
    "measurements of the 10 - 100 ghz emission will constrain the abundance of very small grains , including spatial variations , as well as their possible alignment .    we thank tom herbig , anglica de oliveira - costa , lyman page , alex refregier , david spergel , max tegmark , and david wilkinson for helpful discussions .",
