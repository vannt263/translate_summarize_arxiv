    "the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is the primary `` disk - line '' target , in which a relativistically broadened iron k - emission line is suggested to originate in the innermost region of the accretion disk around the black hole ( e.g. , tanaka et al .",
    "mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is also known to exhibit characteristic x - ray spectral variations ; inoue & matsumoto ( 2001 , 2003 ) , fabian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and matsumoto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported significantly small variability in the iron line energy band of mcg 6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "it is found that the energy - dependent root mean square ( rms ) variability is suppressed around the iron line energy , particularly in longer timescales .",
    "inoue and matsumoto ( 2001 , 2003 ) proposed that the absorbed spectrum due to photo - ionized warm absorbers mimic shape of the strongly red - shifted iron line , and variation of the warm absorbers may explain the apparently small variability in the iron line energy band .    on the other hand , miniutti and fabian ( 2004 ) proposed that the suppressed variability in the iron line band may be explained by the general relativistic light - bending effects , which take place in the very vicinity of the black hole .",
    "miniutti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) claim that the suzaku spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is in fact consistent with the light - bending model .",
    "niedwiecki & ycki ( 2008 ) and niedwiecki & miyakawa ( 2010 ) independently re - examined the light - bending model , and concluded that it is possible to explain the suppressed variability in the iron energy band assuming a particular configuration and movement of the illuminating source .",
    "ycki et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , on the other hand , claim that the light - bending model is not able to explain the suzaku spectrum , if a broader energy range is adopted than used by miniutti et al .  ( 2007 ) .",
    "the primary question in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is whether the iron line is truely broad and its little variability is a consequence of the general relativistic light bending effects or not .",
    "the critical point to address the problem is to model the underlying continuum spectrum correctly , since the broad iron line parameters are dependent on the choice of the continuum spectral model .",
    "in fact , on one hand , miller , turner , and reeves ( 2008 ) claim that the `` disk - line '' is not required , when the continuum spectrum is modeled with multiple warm absorbers . on the other hand ,",
    "reynolds et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argue that the absorption - dominated model over - predicts the 6.4 kev fluorescent line emission , and the disk - line model is more physically reasonable .",
    "miller et al . ( 2009 ) counterargue that the calculation in reynolds et al . ( 2009 ) neglects opacity at the 6.4 kev line energy , and conclude that variation in the partial - covering fraction may dominate the observed x - ray spectral variability .",
    "however , the partial covering scenario by miller et al . ( 2009 ) requires a number of free parameters to model the observed spectrum .",
    "therefore , in order to examine the partial covering scenario , reducing the number of parameters , if possible , and constructing a concrete physical picture to explain the spectral variation is certainly intriguing .    recently , using the suzaku data taken in january 2006 , miyakawa et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( hereafter paper i ) found a clear correlation between the intensity in the 6  10 kev band and the spectral ratio of 0.5  3.0 kev / 6  10 kev in a time - scale of @xmath9 sec .",
    "essentially the same spectral correlation was confirmed for longer timescales up to @xmath814 years in the rxte data ( miyakawa 2010 ) .",
    "paper i adopted a spectral model composed of a direct power - law component , its reflection component by a neutral matter ( with the solid - angle @xmath10 ) , two warm absorbers with different ionization states .",
    "the observed spectral variation requires change of the apparent slope of the direct component , whereas the shape and intensity of the reflection component being invariable .",
    "a mildly broad iron emission line was required at @xmath11 kev with an intrinsic width of 0.29 kev ( 1 @xmath12 ) and the equivalent - width 100 ev ; such an extremely broadened `` disk line '' as is claimed by miniutti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) was not required . in this paper ,",
    "following paper i , we attempt to comprehensively understand spectral variability of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 using suzaku and chandra archival data .",
    "our goal is to find a spectral model which can naturally explain the observed spectral variation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 with a minimum set of free - parameters .",
    "if we are successful to construct such a reasonable spectral model , we will see if the relativistically distorted iron emission line is truely present or not in the energy spectrum .",
    "we believe this is an important step forward to fully understand x - ray spectral properties of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , seyfert galaxies , and black holes .",
    "we use the same suzaku data used in paper i , taken in 2006 from january 9 to 14th ( 143 ksec exposure ) , from 23 to 26 ( 99 ksec ) and from 27 to 30 ( 97 ksec ) .",
    "we use the xis data in 1  10 kev , and pin data in 10  40 kev . in the present paper , we are interested in spectral variations above 1 kev , so we did not use the data below 1 kev .",
    "all of the spectral fits were made with xspec v11 ( arnaud 1996 ) . in the following ,",
    "the xspec model names used in the spectral analysis are explicitly given . a constant factor to adjust normalizations between xis and pin",
    "is fixed at 1:1.086 ( ishida et al .",
    "2007 ) . for more details about suzaku data reduction ,",
    "see paper i.    the chandra satellite observed mcg-6 - 30 - 15 several times . in this paper , we use the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) data taken between 2004 may 19 and 27 , when the source was observed four times resulting in a good exposure time of 522 ksec . for data reduction we used the ciao 4.0 software package ; `` tgextract '' is used to produce pha2 spectral files from the level2 event file .",
    "hetgs is composed of high energy grating ( heg ) and medium energy grating ( meg ) .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orders of the heg were combined , and so were the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orders of the meg .",
    "the heg and meg spectra were fitted separately .",
    "errors quoted in this paper are at statistical 90@xmath15 confident level .",
    "in paper i , spectral variation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 was studied assuming the `` two - component '' spectral model given as ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the intrinsic power - law spectrum with a high - energy cut - off ( fixed at 160 kev ; guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 ) , @xmath18 is normalization factor of the directly observed component , @xmath19 is normalization factor of the reflected component , @xmath20 is reflection albedo by the cold optically thick matter ( `` pexrav '' in xspec : magdziarz @xmath21 zdziarski 1995 ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent attenuation by a high- and a low - ionized warm absorbers , respectively , and @xmath24 is an iron @xmath25 emission line .",
    "effect of interstellar absorption is always taken into account in the spectral fitting ( `` phabs '' ; balucinska - church @xmath21 mccammon 1992 ) , but its term is omitted for simplicity in the above expression and hereafter .",
    "amount of the disk reflection is measured with @xmath26 , solid angle of the reflector seen from the central source .",
    "ratio of the normalization of the reflection component to that of the cutoff power - law component corresponds to @xmath26/2@xmath27 , assuming isotropic emission of the central source .",
    "we used xstar version 2.1kn8 ( kallman et al . 2004 ) to model the warm absorbers .",
    "the temperature , pressure and density of the warm absorbers are assumed to be @xmath28 k , 0.03 dyne @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the incident photo - ionizing spectrum is assumed to be a power - law with the index 2.0 , and the solar abundance by greeves , noels and sauval ( 1996 ) is adopted for the ionized material .",
    "we made a grid model by running xstar for different values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; the log @xmath31 values are from 0.1 to 5 ( erg cm s@xmath33 ) and the @xmath32 values are from @xmath34 to @xmath35 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the number of steps for log @xmath31 and @xmath32 are both 20 , thus our grid model has @xmath36 grid - points .",
    "the redshift of a warm absorber and the source are fixed at 0.001 and 0.00775 , respectively ( young et al .",
    "2005 , fisher et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in paper",
    "i , we found that the spectral variation at various timescales is successfully explained by variations of two parameters , normalization factor of the directly observed component ( @xmath18 ) and apparent slope of the direct component , such that the slope gets steeper for greater normalizations .",
    "the apparent slope change is described by either change of the index of the power - law component ( @xmath17 ) , ionization state of the low - ionized warm absorber , or column density of the low - ionized warm absorber ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "below , we scrutinize the spectral model in paper i carefully , and introduce a more elaborated model . using the chandra hetgs , young et al .",
    "( 2005 ) resolved a narrow emission line at 6.4 kev in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , which we confirmed via re - analysis of the archival data .",
    "the equivalent width of the line is measured as @xmath37 ev , which requires a cold reflector with a solid angle of @xmath26/2@xmath27 @xmath8 0.3 viewed from the central x - ray source ( e.g. , george @xmath21 fabian 1991 ) . on the other hand , the best - fit values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 obtained in paper",
    "i indicates that @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , in order to account for the observed disk reflection spectrum of an amount of @xmath26/2@xmath27 @xmath8 1 including the outer disk reflection with @xmath26/2@xmath27 @xmath8 0.3 , we need another disk reflection component or a different spectral component which is similar to disk reflection , corresponding to an amount of @xmath26/2@xmath27 @xmath8 0.7 .",
    "thus , we separate the @xmath19 term in ( [ eq1 ] ) into two terms .",
    "one is the reflection continuum component from a cold reflector emitting a narrow iron @xmath39 line , solid angle of which is @xmath26/2@xmath27 @xmath8 0.3 .",
    "the other is introduced to represent the remaining part of the @xmath19 term ; for this , we adopt a heavily absorbed component by warm absorber , since the absorbed component is similar to the reflection component in shape , and does not have to accompany the fluorescent iron emission line .",
    "in fact , a partial covering model has been proposed to explain the continuum spectral shape and variation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( e.g. , matsuoka et al .  1990 ; mckernan and yaqoob 1998 ; miller , turner and reeves 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "resultantly , we introduce a new spectral model expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is normalization of the direct component , @xmath42 is that for the heavily absorbed component , @xmath43 stands for another warm absorber that is for the ionized optically thick partial absorber .",
    "the normalization factor of the outer reflection component , @xmath44 is constant and related to the average of @xmath41 so that @xmath45 , and @xmath24 is a narrow iron emission line with a fixed equivalent width of @xmath46 ev .",
    "hereafter , this model is referred as the `` three - component '' model .",
    "we try the three - component model to the suzaku average spectrum in 1  40 kev .",
    "we found the fit improves if we additionally put a weak iron neutral edge at 7.11 kev and an absorption line at 7.0 kev .",
    "the former is considered to be due to a slight difference of the assumed @xmath26 from the exact value , and the latter due to deficiency of the h - like iron absorption line equivalent - width already included in the xstar model .",
    "figure @xmath47 and table [ miyakawa_model_ave_suzaku ] show the fitting result for the suzaku average spectrum with the three - component model in 1  40 kev .",
    "parameters of the high - ionized and low - ionized warm absorbers are similar to those in paper i. for the newly introduced absorption component ( @xmath43 ) , we obtain @xmath48 1.6 @xmath49 10@xmath50 @xmath2 and @xmath51 .",
    "normalizations of the heavily absorbed component and the direct component are 0.60 and 1.44 ( @xmath52 photons s@xmath33@xmath2 at 1 kev ) , respectively , which suggests that the source is partially covered by the ionized thick matter by @xmath53 30 % .",
    "we note that the absorbing matter is marginally compton thick , so that the compton scattering may not be negligible for precise spectral calculation ( e.g. , yaqoob 1997 ) .",
    "this is not considered in the present paper , and will be a subject for future work .",

    "therefore , we examine if presence of the disk line is reconciled with our three - component model .",
    "we analyze the time - average spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 adding a disk line model from a fast - rotating kerr black hole ( laor 1991 ) .",

    "@xmath93 chi - squares become greater as @xmath73 gets less than @xmath94 200 @xmath90 , and it exceeds 2.71 when @xmath73 is less than 9 @xmath90 .",
    "namely , our three - component model is only reconciled with a mildly broad disk line from the region @xmath95 with 90 % confidence .",
    "the reason we do not require a strong , extremely distorted disk line is primarily because that the newly introduced heavily absorbed component in our three - component model ( the @xmath96 term in equation [ eq2 ] ) has an ionized iron edge feature which resembles the broad disk line shape ( figure [ miyakawa_model_fit_suzaku ] ) .",
    "secondary reason is that the warm absorbers ( @xmath23 and @xmath22 in equation [ eq2 ] ) have spectral curvatures below @xmath85 kev without which the residual may look like a low - energy tail of the disk line .",
    "consequently , we see that the disk line feature is dependent on the choice of the continuum spectral models , and an extremely distorted disk line is not required in our three - component model .      next , we apply the three - component model to the eight `` intensity - sliced spectra '' ( the same spectral sets as used in paper i ) to investigate for spectral variations .",
    "the method of creating the intensity - sliced energy spectra is as follows : ( 1 ) we created a light curve ( the average of xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) , with a bin - width of 128 s in the 0.2  12 kev band .",
    "we found that the counting rate varies from @xmath97 to @xmath98 cts s@xmath33 .",

    "these intensity ranges are chosen so that the exposure time for each intensity bin be approximately equal .",
    "( 3 ) from the eight time - periods corresponding to the different source flux levels , we created eight intensity - sliced energy spectra ( the sum of xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) .    here",
    ", all the parameters are made the same for the eight spectra except the following three parameters ; the direct power - law normalization , @xmath41 , the absorbed power - law normalization , @xmath42 , and ionization degree of the low - ionized warm absorber , @xmath23 .",
    "attenuation by a warm absorber is expressed as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is energy and ionization - degree dependent cross - section and @xmath101 is the hydrogen column density of the low - ionized absorber .",
    "variation of @xmath23 is due to either a variation of @xmath100 or @xmath101 , or both . here , we investigate two cases , one with a variation of the cross - section @xmath100 due to change of the ionization parameter @xmath31 , the other with a variation of @xmath102 .",
    "eight spectra are fitted simultaneously , and the both cases equally exhibit acceptable fits with reduced chi - square values 1.09 and 0.95 ( d.o.f = 1135 ) , respectively .",

    "correlations between each two of the three parameters are obvious .",

    "next , we will see if the three - component model is valid to describe the chandra hetg spectra and their variations .",
    "strength of chandra hetg compared to suzaku is that it can study variation of individual low - energy absorption lines corresponding to change of the ionization degree .",
    "first , we fit the chandra / hetgs spectra with the three - component model in 1.0  7.5 kev . since the energy range is much smaller than that of suzaku , some parameters are not constrained and thus fixed to the suzaku best - fit values . in figure @xmath106 and table [ miyakawa_model_ave_chandra ]",

    "next , we study possible ionization degree variations in the chandra / hetgs data by extracting the `` bright spectrum '' and `` faint spectrum '' as follows : 1 ) create a light curve with a time - bin - width of 128 sec , and calculate average counting rates .",
    "2 ) create the `` bright spectrum '' from the period when the meg and heg count rates ( 0.410 kev ) are higher than the average , and the `` faint spectrum '' when the count rates are lower than the average .",

    "we also fit the bright / faint spectra in the 1.752.10 kev band separately with a single power - law and two negative gaussians to investigate for the sixiii ( he - like 1.851.86 kev ) and sixiv ( h - like 2.00 kev ) lines . in figure @xmath107",

    "we notice that the mgxi absorption line equivalent width is larger in the faint state , while that of the mgxii line is larger in the bright state .",
    "this is understood as due to change of the ionization state of the warm absorber , such that mgxi is more abundant in the faint state , while mgxii is more abundant in the bright state .",
    "in fact , ion fraction of mgxi and that of mgxii become equal at @xmath109 ( e.g. , kallman @xmath21 bautista 2001 ) , that is about the best - fit value of the low - ionized warm absorber ( tables [ tab : chandra3comp ] ) . as for si absorption lines ,",
    "the sixiii line equivalent width is oppositely larger for the bright spectrum , which is explained by the low - ionized warm absorber with @xmath110 , since ion fraction of sixiii increases when @xmath104 varies from @xmath111 to @xmath112 ( kallman @xmath21 bautista 2001 ) .",
    "fraction of sixiv should increase more dramatically when @xmath104 increases accordingly ( kallman @xmath21 bautista 2001 ) , but the observed equivalent widths of the sixiv line is not much different .",

    "identifying this with @xmath268 10@xmath269 cm ( equation [ eq : r2 ] ) , the central black hole mass of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is @xmath270 .",
    "thus , the central x - ray source ( @xmath271 cm ) is extended to @xmath272 around the black hole . besides variation of the blr coluds ,",
    "the x - ray source is variable on a timescale down to @xmath8 1 ksec ( inoue , miyakawa and ebisawa 2011 ) , which may be compared with the free fall time , @xmath273 .",
    "then , the intrinsic source variation arises at a few times the schwarzshild radius , around the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "we point out that solid angle of the low - ionized clouds seen from the x - ray source should be much smaller than 4@xmath27 , otherwise we will have to see strong fluorescent lines from the clouds . if a thick absorber with @xmath274 @xmath2 covers the power - law component completely ( @xmath275 ) ,",
    "equivalent width of the iron line to the reflection component is @xmath8 1 kev . considering @xmath276 0.3 and the ratio of the reflection component to the direct component , 10 to 1 , the expected iron line equivalent width is @xmath8 30 ev . as mentioned in subsection 5.5.2 , we found the fit improves if a mildly broad disk - line is added , where the best - fit inner radius and the equivalent width are @xmath277 200 @xmath90 and @xmath278 ev , respectively ( table [ miyakawa_diskline_model_ave_suzaku ] ) .",
    "these mildly broadened , weak iron emission lines may well be expected from fluorescence in the blr clouds .",
    "figure @xmath279 gives a schematic view of internal structure of the low - ionized cloud and the variable partial covering model surrounding the black hole .",
    "the low - ionized cloud ( blr cloud ) has internal ionization structure .",
    "a putative blocker in the core would block the incoming x - rays completely .",
    "the main body of the low - ionized cloud is the thick partial absorber surrounding the core .",
    "still the outer cloud envelope corresponds to the thin low - ionized warm absorber .",
    "central x - ray emission region around the black hole is mildly extended , and partially covered by these low - ionized clouds .",
    "variation of the covering fraction explains most of the observed flux and spectral variations .",
    "finally we comment that the idea of partial covering is not new for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 to explain its spectral shape and varaition ( e.g. , matsuoka et al .",
    "1990 ; mckernan and yaqoob 1998 ; miller , turner and reeves 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "recently , similar partial covering models are proposed to explain spectral variations of ngc 3516 ( turner et al .",
    "2008 ) , mrk 766 ( risaliti et al .  2011 ) and other seyfert galaxies ( turner & miller 2009 ) .",
    "presumably , partial covering of rather constant x - ray source is a common mechanism in seyfert galaxies .",
    "it is of interest to study spectral variations of seyfert galaxies systematically to see if the observed x - ray variablity is truely due to intrinsic luminosity variation or explained by partial covering of the constant source .",
    "we have analyzed suzaku and chandra archival data of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and constructed a new model to explain the observed spectral variation .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized below :    1 .",
    "we have shown that the observed energy spectra and spectral variation can be explained by the `` three - component model '' ( equation [ eq2 ] ) that includes ( 1 ) a direct power - law component , ( 2 ) a heavily absorbed power - law component by thich photoionized material , and ( 3 ) a cold disk reflection component far from the black hole .",
    "the first two components are affected by two warm abosrbers having different ionization states .",
    "the ionized iron k - edge of the heavily absorbed component and spectral curvature due to the warm absorbers explain most of the seemingly broad `` disk line '' spectral feature .",
    "consequently , general relativistic interpretation of the broad iron emission line feature in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is not confirmed .",
    "the claim that mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is a kerr black hole with nearly extreme rotation assuming the relativistic line - broadening ( e.g. , miniutti et al .",
    "2007 ) is questionable .",
    "3 .   we propose the `` variable partial covering model '' , in which a central , moderately extended x - ray source is partially covered by variable low - ionized clouds in the line of sight . in this model ,",
    "observed x - ray spectral variation is primarily caused by change of the partial covering fraction of the central source .",
    "these absorbing clouds presumably correspond to the fast - moving broad line region ( blr ) clouds .",
