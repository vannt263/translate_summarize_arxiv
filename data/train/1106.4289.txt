    "the first one is critical for the generation and the separation of the dot / channel structure .",
    "the second one helps indirectly to achieve the desired pattern conversion .",
    "the main objective of this section is to discuss the limitations of process simulation with these two process steps .      to date",
    ", the seminal model of deal and grove remains the most popular approach used in process simulators to model the oxide growth @xcite .",
    "the kinetic of oxide growth can be simply described by the following equation :    @xmath4.\\ ] ]    the oxide thickness @xmath5 is described by a linear - parabolic relationship as a function of the oxidation duration @xmath6 .",
    "the term @xmath7 characterizes the growth rate regime :    @xmath8    whereas @xmath9 gives the parabolic rate constant that governs the diffusion limited regime in the limit of very long oxidation time :    @xmath10    the diffusivity of the oxidant species and the reaction rate k@xmath11 can directly be deduced from the linear parabolic constants :    @xmath12    where c@xmath13 is the oxidant solubility in the oxide and n@xmath14 is the number of oxidant molecules incorporated into a unit volume of the oxide .",
    "the well - known breakdown of the deal and grove model @xcite in the ultra - thin regime is not a significant issue here since only very long wet oxidation are considered .",
    "however , three points have to be carefully addressed : the mesh refinement , the influence and the diffusion of arsenic on the oxidation reaction rate and the global influence of strain on oxidation .",
    "one critical issue is the mesh refinement since the dot radius is less than 20 nm",
    ". the refinement must be as dense as possible in the region of high doping and more relaxed in other parts of the system ( nitride mask , buried oxide ) .",
    "the second aspect is that the grid refinement must be preserved during the simulation of the oxidation process .",
    "one solution to preserve the quality of the initial grid during oxidation is to perform simulation using very small time - steps ( less than 1 ms ) and regenerate and adapt the grid frequently .",
    "the influence of arsenic on the reaction rate is described by the theory of ho and plummer @xcite .",
    "the physical effect behind the oxidation rate enhancement is that the silicon fermi level is shifted by doping .",
    "the change of the fermi level enhances the concentration of vacancy that naturally provides more reaction sites for the oxidation mechanism . the linear oxidation rate in presence of dopants",
    "can be expressed by :    @xmath15   \\label{one}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the intrinsic linear reaction rate for wet oxidation which depends on many other parameters ( temperature , pressure ) , @xmath17 is an empirical temperature dependent parameter and @xmath18 is the normalized total vacancy concentration .",
    "since dopants are assumed to influence only the oxidation rate , it should be noticed that the anisotropy will be maximum in the reaction limited regime ( eq .",
    "[ linear ] ) and negligible in the diffusion limited regime ( eq .",
    "[ parabolic ] ) .",
    "[ fig : facdop ] shows the influence of the linear oxidation rate as a function of the arsenic concentration predicted by the ho and plummer model @xcite .",
    "the concentration should exceed 3@xmath110@xmath19 at/@xmath20 in order to observe an increase .",
    "another effect related to arsenic is the thermal diffusion during the oxidation process .",
    "a reduction of the initial arsenic gradient probably takes place during the oxidation process . in order to describe the diffusion of arsenic during this step ,",
    "a standard five stream model has been used @xcite .",
    "the main issue is to have a correct description of the amplitude and the shape of the arsenic peak .",
    "a correct description of the arsenic tail and ted ( transient enhanced diffusion ) effects is not crucial here .      in our specific case",
    ", the presence of arsenic has a major impact on the reaction rate . on the other hand , strain",
    "are expected to reduce the oxidation rate .",
    "the presence of a nitride mask on top of the nanowire and the concave shape of the nanowire generates strain during the oxidation process . in",

    "the use of a simulator where all these different models are implemented is required . moreover ,",
    "severe constraints are imposed on the grid refinement . both dios @xcite and tsuprem4 @xcite process simulators have been used .",
    "relatively close results have been obtained as far as the kinetics of the dot formation is investigated .",
    "thank to the dios features advanced mesh refinement it has been possible also to investigate the oxidation of the dot . in order to access the evolution of the various parameters of the memory cell , a monitoring tool has been developed @xcite .",
    "the main limitation in our study is the description of the mechanical strain field in process simulators .",
    "[ fig : stress_field ] illustrates this point where the strain field in the oxide layer is reported for the simulation of the standard process described in the previous section .",
    "two contours ( @xmath30 700 mpa ) of the hydrostatic pressure are reported based on tsuprem4 simulation .",
    "very large compressive stress levels are observed in the vicinity of the dot whereas the nitride mask is subject to a high tensile stress .",
    "as far as we approach the outside silicon dioxide interface , stress decreases as the relaxation is much more important .",
    "such a large level of stress at the nanometer scale indicates that we are too close to the limits for a finite elements simulations to expect a correct description of the mechanical stress around the dot .",
    "the use of coupled atomistic / continuous models could be a solution @xcite .",
    "the second limitation is the use of a viscoelastic approach to describe the oxide deformation @xcite .",
    "it has already been shown by rafferty et al .",
    "@xcite that linear viscous approach strongly overestimates the stress generated during cylinder oxidation at low oxidation temperature and large deformation .",
    "interface between the two cylinders ] in principle , an elastoplastic model would be necessary to properly estimate the stress field surrounding the silicon dot for low oxidation temperatures @xcite .",
    "the third limitation is the modeling of the pile - up of arsenic at the si / sio@xmath0 interface @xcite .",
    "_ despite these fundamental modeling restrictions , it will be shown that interesting trends can be extracted based on the relatively good description of experimental oxidation kinetics in the presence of arsenic by the coupling of the ho and plummer model @xcite and the deal and grove models @xcite_.      due to the strong concentration of dopants , it has been observed experimentally that the top of the mesa structure is overetched during its creation .",
    "this overetching effect has been observed and explained by winters et al . @xcite .",
    "the concentration of negative etching ions is increased due to the electrostatic interaction between fluorine ions from the reactive plasma at the surface and the dopant charges in the silicon .",
    "the increase of the etching rate in the high doping region leads to a trapezoidal shape for the mesa - structure with a neck at the top concentration .",
    "this effect has a major impact experimentally on the final device structure and facilitates the creation of the dot . the sem image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : etch1 ] ) clearly shows the presence of overetching in the presence of strong arsenic doping .",
    "this effect must be discussed and incorporated in our two dimensional simulations .",
    "an empirical approach has been adopted in order to match as finely as possible the experimental shape .",
    "[ fig : etch2 ] shows the shape of the mesa - structure matching the experimental configuration of fig 5.b ) .",
    "the neck at the top is approximated by a simple trapezoidal shape .",
    "three etching steps are used in the process simulator to generate the full structure .",
    "the nitride mask etching is simulated by a perfect anisotropic etching .",
    "next 90 nm of the silicon layer are etched with an angle of 104@xmath31 with respect to the horizontal direction to simulate the overetching and the presence of the neck . finally , a classical anisotropic etch with an angle of 60@xmath31 ( from the horizontal direction )",
    "is performed to match the shape of the mesa - structure at the bottom .",
    "all of this process leads to an accurate shape of the mesa - structure matching the experimental one .",
    "experimentally , the creation of a silicon dot has always been observed for 80 minutes of wet oxidation at 800@xmath31c .",
    "process variations show that the oxidation duration should be defined very finely in order to completely liberate the dot to avoid a complete consumption by the oxidation mechanism .",
    "based on process simulation , the objective is therefore to investigate the best process conditions for dot formation .",
    "two parameters have been identified for their influence on the dot formation : the oxidation temperature and the nanowire geometry .",
    "the most important factor for the reliability of our device is the time window during which the dot is formed but not yet consumed .",
    "this point is governed by the difference between the oxidation time to create the dot and that to consume it .",
    "[ fig : time ] reports the evolution of these parameters as a function of the oxidation temperature for various thermal budgets .",
    "first of all , an hyperbolic decrease ( @xmath32 t@xmath33 ) is observed for both the creation and consumption time as a function of oxidation temperature .",
    "for example , the creation time is 160 min . at 750@xmath31c and reduces to 24 min . at 900@xmath31c .",
    "this result tells us that the oxidation temperature must be higher than 750@xmath31c to keep a reasonable processing time . on the other hand",
    ", it has been observed that the difference between the creation time and the consumption time vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature . at 900@xmath31c ,",
    "the dot is created and consumed at the same time , therefore the recommended wet oxidation temperature range is [ 775@xmath31c-850@xmath31c ] in order to ensure the dot existence .",
    "the best compromise is around 800@xmath31c which ensures the presence of the dot in the central region and allows the full consumption of silicon in the constriction regions .",
    "the oxidation temperature has also clear impact on the size of the dot .",
    "the evolution of the dot shape as a function of the oxidation temperature has been simulated .",
    "[ fig : shape2 ] reports both the channel and dot cross sections .",
    "it can be observed that the size of the dot is strongly reduced by increasing the temperature .",
    "[ fig : shape2 ] shows that the dot maximal half width is about 25 nm at 800@xmath31c and reduces to less than 5 nm for 850@xmath31c . for a higher temperature than 900@xmath31c",
    ", no dot is created .",
    "obviously , the oxidation temperature has a clear impact on the process reliability .",
    "it directly influences the oxidation parameters such as the oxidation rate or the strain relaxation mechanism .",
    "however , the main striking effect is the reduction of the arsenic gradient responsible for the dot creation , which in turn affects the dot formation .",
    "the evolution of the arsenic profile upon annealing in an inert ambience is reported . in fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] for fixed temperatures and durations corresponding to the onset of the dot creation , as obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] . for temperature below 850@xmath31c ,",
    "the arsenic profile remains essentially unaffected by thermal diffusion .",
    "dopant diffusion becomes significant at 900@xmath31c with a strong broadening of the arsenic profilec and 800@xmath31c .",
    "when the temperature reaches 900@xmath31c , a clear reduction of the maximum level of doping is observed for a 30 min . annealing . ]",
    "10@xmath34at/@xmath20 ) is just below the concentration where the diffusivity dramatically increases with doping concentration @xcite . ] .",
    "it is clear that the broadening and the flattening of the arsenic profile reduce the anisotropic character of the oxidation step and explains the difficulty to observe the dot creation at temperatures above 850@xmath31c .",
    "the main objective is to estimate the influence of the nanowire initial width ( at the top of the mesa - structure ) on the dot existence .",
    "all the other process parameters related to the implantation or the oxidation step are those reported in section ii . in the present experimental study ,",
    "the top linewidth of the mesa - structure defined by the lithography step varies from 200 nm down to 50 nm .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] presents some cross sections after the oxidation step for various linewidths ( 80 , 120 and 200 nm ) .",
    "precise data about the dot size could not be estimated from sem analysis but the nanofloating gate diameter is about 20 nm with a significant error bar @xcite .",
    "the critical experimental linewidth that ensures the dot existence for this set of experiments is observed for 120 nm @xmath30 10 nm .",
    "the dot is not separated from the channel for a linewidth larger than 130 nm which is therefore favorable to generate the source / drain regions . on the other hand , for a narrower linewidth than 100 nm ,",
    "no dot is observed from sem cross section analysis and the configuration seems suitable for the constriction regions .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that the experimental technique used to observe the dot could weaken the structure since some of the sio@xmath0 cover is removed and that a very small dot could be present but not observed .",
    "a theoretical study has been undertaken in order to quantify the influence of this parameter .",
    "the top linewidth of the mesa - structure used in simulation varies from 200 nm down to 50 nm .",
    "the overetching effect is taken into account as described in section iii.b .",
    "[ fig : central_soi ] presents the simulation of the oxidation step for various linewidths ( 80 , 120 and 200 nm ) corresponding to the constriction , central part and source / drain regions respectively . the direct comparison between the simulated configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : central_soi ] ) and their experimental counterpart ( fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] ) is of particular interest .",
    "it can be noticed that there is a global agreement .",
    "moreover , the triangular shape of the channel as well as the dot geometry ( shape , position ) is well described .",
    "the dot - channel distance is estimated above 45 nm and can be compare to the experimental value of @xmath35 40 nm in fig .",
    "[ fig : central_soi ] .",
    "the main discrepancy is observed for the bottom channel since clearly less oxidation is predicted .. this layer plays a major role as it tends to delay the oxidation of the bottom part of the channel ] fig .",
    "[ fig : param_soi ] presents also a nice results on the dot creation line as simulation predicts almost exactly the experimental linewidth where a dot is first observed . from the simulation point of view , the dot is just separated from the channel for a 125 nm nanowire linewidth .",
    "on the other hand , the theoretical critical range for the dot existence is clearly much larger 40 nm compared to the experimental one .",
    "two possible explanations can be proposed about this difference .",
    "the first one is related to the limits of the experimental technique used to observe the single dot as discussed just before - mentioned .",
    "the other one is related to the models limitations discussed in section iii.a .",
    "stress levels with decreasing silicon dot size are probably overestimated which could lead to the underestimation of wet oxidation kinetics and a larger critical range for the dot existence . on the other hand with respect to the experimental limits",
    ", simulation confirms that the silicon dot is completely consumed for a 80 nm wide nanowire configuration and that self - limited oxidation effects @xcite are not sufficient to stop the reaction in our present case .",
    "process simulation can help to have an estimate of the variation of the dot ( shape , size , position)and the parameter range that allow for dot formation .",
    "the dot generated by our process has a triangular shape with a dot height often more important than the dot width . in order to simplify the discussion ,",
    "the use of a mean radius which matches as closely as possible the dot geometry is proposed .",
    "the variation of the dot properties as a function of the linewidth are reported fig .",
    "[ fig : param_soi ] . the dot radius r@xmath36 decreases linearly with the initial linewidth .",
    "it can be described by the following relationship with a small set of parameters :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the linewidth , d@xmath39 is the critical line for the dot creation ( 125 nm ) and r@xmath39 is the associated maximum radius ( 20 nm ) .",
    "another interesting parameter is the variation of the dot position with the nanowire initial width . in general",
    ", the dot center is located 30 nm below the top silicon surface close to the midpoint between the top surface and the arsenic profile maximum .",
    "it can be observed that the thickness of the oxide separates the dot from the channel increases as the initial linewidth decreases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : param_soi ] ) . as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : central_soi2 ] , the dot position approaches 15 nm for a linewidth around 90 nm .",
    "this trend can be simply described by the following linear empirical law as a function of the difference between the linewidth and d@xmath39 = 125 nm :    @xmath40    this effect can be explained by the fact that , for thinner structures , the oxidation is more important in the region of strong arsenic gradient since there is a smaller amount of silicon to oxidize for the same thermal budget .    finally , the evolution of the tunnel oxide thickness @xmath41 ( the dot - channel distance ) is also reported .",
    "the tunnel oxide increases almost linearly with downscaling as the thermal budget is kept constant and not adjusted for the critical linewidth study .",
    "@xmath42      the existence of two critical linewidth ( 125 nm and 80 nm ) for the dot existence has been clearly established by the process simulation in agreement with the experiments .",
    "the different structures are correctly described by process simulation despite the limitations in section iii .",
    "the difference ( 15 @xmath43 ) observed on the critical line for the dot consumption could be explained by the limits of the experimental technique and also by the limitations related to strain effects at the nanometer scale , two dimensional arsenic dopant diffusion and segregation .",
    "process simulation also provides interesting trends for dot geometry characteristics .",
    "the mean radius of the nanofloating gate scales down almost linearly with the linewidth . on the other hand , the dot - channel distance and the dot center position increases due to a strong oxidation rate at the bottom of the nanofloating gate .",
    "these variations have been quantified and empirical variation laws extracted .",
    "one challenge faced by alternative nanometric devices is their scalability . in addition",
    ", aggressive size reduction would open the perspective to operate close to single electron mode of operation .",
    "the main objective of this section is to evaluate the possibility of downscaling this alternative device using the same simulation strategy that was above detailed .",
    "downscaling of the standard device by a factor 2 is our target .",
    "the first issue is to adapt our process for the implementation on a thinner silicon film of 100 nm .",
    "the film thickness reduction mainly impacts the implantation conditions .",
    "the objective is to create a sharp arsenic gradient in a more localized area .",
    "first simulations show that the arsenic peak should not be too close to the silicon surface in order to create the dot since oxidation takes also place under the nitride mask .",
    "therefore , the arsenic maximum has to be located into the top third of the silicon film as in the standard configuration .",
    "a reduction of the implantation energy around 60 kev is therefore recommended .",
    "the scaling of the dose must be investigated but other implantation conditions ( tilt angle ) could remain unchanged .",
    "the second issue is that in order to be able to form the constrictions , the region where the channel will be formed should be significantly thicker that where the dot will .      in the downscaling study ,",
    "the initial configuration shown in fig .",

    "first , large configurations ( 80 nm to 60 nm ) have been simulated . from the simulation standpoint",
    ", it clearly appears that downscaling is feasible . the final structure is well organized since the dot is in the top half of the film and the constriction region in the bottom half of the device .",

    "[ fig : sum_param ] summarizes the evolution of two parameters ( the dot mean radius and the thermal budget of the wet oxidation step)as a function of the nanowire linewidth . for a large configuration of 80 nm , the mean radius approaches the 10 nm target .",

    "single dots generated with this technique hold the noteworthy property of tight dot size control .",
