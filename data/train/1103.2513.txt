    "similarly , @xmath16 denotes the number of edges of @xmath7 whose distance to the vertex @xmath5 is smaller than the distance to the vertex @xmath6 .",
    "we now define four topological indices : pi , vertex pi , szeged and edge szeged indices of @xmath7 as follows    @xmath17    notice that for trees @xmath18 and for bipartite graphs @xmath19 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present two improved inequalities on @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 indices , and completely describe the extremal graphs . in section 3 we prove sharp lower bounds on the vertex pi and szeged index involving zagreb indices and correct the equality cases for the upper bound involving the number of triangles .",
    "in section  4 we correct the equality case regarding pi and edge szeged index and present new sharp bound using p ' olya  szeg \" o inequality .",

    "a chordal graph is a simple graph such that each of its cycles of four or more vertices has a chord , which is an edge joining two vertices that are not adjacent in the cycle .",
    "in @xcite the authors stated that a graph @xmath7 from @xmath24 must be a complete graph or a chordal graph of diameter @xmath31 .",
    "it follows that the set @xmath24 is composed of the graphs with diameter @xmath31 such that there are no induced path @xmath32 or cycle @xmath33 in the graph @xmath7 .",

    "therefore , @xmath56 must be adjacent to all vertices @xmath60 , which implies that @xmath61 .",

    "it is obvious that no graph from @xmath62 contains pendent vertex ( for a pendent vertex @xmath6 with the only neighbor @xmath5 it holds @xmath64 ) .",
    "therefore , the minimum vertex degree of graphs from @xmath62 is greater than or equal to @xmath31 .",
    "if all vertices have degree @xmath31 , then @xmath65 and it can be easily seen that only @xmath66 and @xmath33 belong to @xmath62 .    the vertex @xmath6 is called branching if @xmath67 .",

    "a simple corollary of proposition [ prp : pi - diameter ] and proposition [ prp : sz - diameter ] is  @xcite @xmath105    the following upper bound on the vertex pi index was proved in @xcite .",

    "a graph is odd - hole - free if it has no induced subgraph that is a cycle of odd length greater than 3 .",
