    "among the large variety of galactic neutron stars , magnetars constitute the most energetic and unpredictable class @xcite .",
    "they are x - ray pulsars rotating at relatively long periods ( 0.312s , with @xmath9@xmath10   ) , and persistent x - ray luminosities of @xmath11@xmath12  .",
    "they exhibit flaring activity , generally classified as _ giant flares _ ( @xmath13@xmath14erg emitted in several minutes ) , _ intermediate flares _",
    "( @xmath15@xmath16erg in a few minutes ) or _ short x - ray bursts _ ( @xmath17@xmath18erg in less than a second ) , as well as large increases of the persistent flux ( outbursts ) which can last about 1 yr @xcite .",
    "the powerful emission observed from these objects has been attributed to their exceptionally high magnetic field ( @xmath19@xmath20 g at the star surface ) , hence the name magnetars @xcite .",
    "analysis of stellar orbits has demonstrated that a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) of about @xmath21 @xmath22 resides at the dynamic center of our galaxy @xcite . the black hole is associated with sgra@xmath0 , a compact source with non - thermal emission in radio , infrared , and x - rays @xcite .",
    "x - ray fluorescence lines from numerous molecular clouds near the galactic center have been interpreted as evidence of interaction with a light echo tracing a past bright state of sgra@xmath0 @xcite .         on 2013",
    "april 24 , _ swift _ detected powerful x - ray emission from the direction of sgra@xmath0 @xcite , initially interpreted as an x - ray flare from the smbh .",
    "one day later , a short x - ray burst was observed from a position consistent with that of sgra@xmath0 , very similar in fluence , duration and spectrum to those commonly observed from magnetars .",
    "the magnetar picture received further support when _ nustar _ observed the region , and detected a persistent source with periodic modulation at 3.76s @xcite , a typical value for magnetar spin periods .",
    "in this letter we report on x - ray ( _ chandra _ and _ swift _ ) and radio ( robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) and parkes radio telescope ) observations of , which point to a likely physical connection of the source with sgra@xmath0 .",
    "_ chandra _ @xcite observed  for the first time on 2013 april 29 with the high resolution camera ( hrc - s ) , and three other times in the following three months with the advanced ccd for imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ; see table[cxologs ] ) .",
    "the hrc - s instrument ( timing mode with a 0.14 \" pixel size ) observed for about 10ks .",
    "the three acis - s observations were performed in faint data mode with the 1/8 chip sub - array ( the source was positioned in the back - illuminated acis - s3 ccd at the nominal target position ; time resolution 0.441s ) .",
    "the data were reduced following standard procedures using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations software ( ciao , version 4.5 ) and the calibration database caldb 4.5.6 .    after the discovery of , _ swift _ observed its field almost daily ( see also @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we use all the observations performed between tjd 16406 and 16480 , taken in both photon counting ( pc ) and windowed timing ( wt ) modes .",
    "only the wt observations could be used for the timing analysis of  ( section[xtiming ] ; readout time of 1.7ms ) , owning to the slow read out time of the pc mode ( 2.5s ) .",
    "the data were processed and filtered with standard criteria using ftools within heasoft software package ( v6.12 ) .    for the acis observation ,",
    "the spectra , ancillary response files and spectral redistribution matrices were created using the ciao script specextract . for the xrt observations , we used the latest available spectral redistribution matrix in caldb ( v013/v014 ) , while the ancillary response files were generated with xrtmkarf , and they account for different extraction regions , vignetting and psf corrections .",
    "we have converted all photon arrival times to the barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) system , using the accurate position derived from the _ chandra _ observations ( see below ) .      in the acis - s observations",
    "a number of sources were detected besides .",
    "in particular , four known sources present in an x - ray catalog @xcite were located within @xmath8@xmath23 from the sgr and could be employed to refine the absolute astrometry .",
    "we used the four source positions , calculated with wavdetect , to register the acis - s images on the catalog by optimizing a roto - translation ( using the ciao script reproject_aspect ) .",
    "the fit yielded an average rms of @xmath880 mas . the estimated coordinates ( taking into account also the accuracy of the reference positions ) of  are : @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( j2000.0 ) with a 95% confidence level uncertainty radius of @xmath26 ( see fig.[hrcfov ] ) .",
    "[ tab : radio ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]              because of the complex shape and variability of the three peaked pulse profile ( fig.[fig : timing ] ) , we decided not to use a pulse template for the timing analysis ( which might artificially affect the phase shift ) , using instead two parallel methods : fitting a sinusoid to the profile at the fundamental period , and fitting the highest peak in all the observations with a gaussian .",
    "we used 12 phase bins to produce a folded pulse profile .",
    "we built up our timing solution from the phases of the second _ chandra _ pointing which has the highest number of counts .",
    "the resulting best - fit period for this _ chandra _ observation was @xmath27 s ( at tjd 16424.5509871 ; tjd = jd  2440000.5 days ) .",

    ", we checked that the timing solution was accurate enough to determine univocally the phase of the following observation . to this end",
    ", we propagated the error affecting the best - fitting parameters of the solution obtained at any step , to the epoch of the newly added observation .",
    "we never obtained a phase uncertainty larger than 0.4 , which allowed us to tentatively maintain the phase connection .",
    "the phase - coherent solution obtained considering the phases of the best - fit fundamental harmonic component has a period @xmath2s and period derivative @xmath29s s@xmath4 ( epoch tjd 16424.5509871 ) , with a reduced chi - squared of 0.85 for 5 degrees of freedom ( dof ) . on the other hand , when comparing this results with the timing solution derived considering the phases of the best - fit gaussian to the main peak , we find compatible numbers for the period and the period derivative , but with a marginal evidence for a cubic component ( resulting in a possible @xmath30ss@xmath31 ) .          in the _ chandra _ observations , the pileup in the acis - s3 detector was @xmath8515@xmath32 , therefore an annular region with @xmath33 inner radius ( 1.5 pixels ) and @xmath34 outer radius was selected to extract the source spectrum . for the background we used an annular region of maximum radius @xmath35 around the source .",
    "the point source spectrum was rebinned to have at least 50 counts per energy bin .",
    "we modeled the spectra using the xspec v.12.8.0j analysis package .",
    "an absorbed single blackbody component ( bb ) provides a good fit to the data of the three acis  s observations ( @xmath36 with 313 dof ) ; the best - fit parameters are : @xmath37cm@xmath31 ( abundances and cross - section from @xcite and @xcite ) , with a temperature cooling from @xmath39kev , to @xmath40kev and then @xmath41kev for the three observations , respectively .",
    "the blackbody radius remains constant within errors at @xmath42 km ( assuming a 8.3kpc distance ) .",
    "the 110kev source flux ( see table[cxologs ] ) corresponds to a luminosity of 2.1 , 1.8 and 1.6 @xmath43(assuming a 8.3kpc distance ) .    however , we note that the fit residuals are not optimal at higher energies , possibly due to the presence of a non - thermal component . by fitting with a power - law function",
    "we also obtain a good modelling ( @xmath44 with 313 dof ) , with @xmath45cm@xmath31 , with photon index of @xmath46 , 4.1(1 ) and 4.2(1 ) for the three observations .",
    "the residuals are slightly better shaped at higher energy .",
    "a composition of a blackbody plus power - law model is not statistically required by the data , and does not improve the fit .",
    "the x - ray flux decay can be modeled with an exponential function of the form @xmath47 ( @xmath48 for 80 dof ) .",
    "we fixed @xmath49 at the time of the first burst detected ; the resulting best - fit parameters are @xmath50 erg cm@xmath31 s@xmath4 and @xmath51-folding time @xmath52144(8)days .",
    "this is a rather slow flux decay as compared with other outbursts ( fig.[figure : xrtlc ] ) .",

    "the very high electron column density expected in the central regions of the galaxy we chose to observe at 3.1ghz ( over a bandwidth of 1024 mhz split into 512 frequency channels ) at parkes , and at 2 and 8.9 ghz ( with a bandwidth of 800 mhz split into 2048 frequency channels ) at gbt ( see table[tab : radio ] ) . at parkes observations",
    "were performed using the atnf digital filterbank ( dfb4 ; @xcite ) in search mode , 2-bit sampling the data every 125 @xmath28s , while at gbt the green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ( guppi ; @xcite ) was used in search mode , 8-bit sampling the data every 64 @xmath28s . for a faster analysis , gbt data were downsampled in time by a factor of 4 and in frequency by a factor of 8 .",
    "data show that at 23ghz , the magnetar switched on between 2013 april 28 and 29 . during the parkes observation the magnetar pulse profile showed a two peaks profile , that evolved into a single one in all subsequent detections ( fig.[fig : timing ] ) . from the 10-cm",
    "parkes observations , we obtained a dispersion measure @xmath5  pc  @xmath6 measured using the tempo2 software package ( consistent with the value derived by @xcite ) .",
    "we performed a series of _ chandra _ observations of the galactic center , determing the position of a new transient magnetar in the crowded region of sgra@xmath0 ( see fig.[hrcfov ] ) .",
    "is at an angular distance from the position of sgra@xmath0 @xcite of only @xmath53 arcsec .",
    "the timing parameters derived in section  [ xtiming ] , imply a surface dipolar magnetic field at the equator @xmath54 g , a rate of rotational energy loss @xmath55@xmath56 , and a characteristic age @xmath57kyr .",
    "radio observations performed with parkes and gbt detected the magnetar radio emission @xcite , with the flux and pulse profile variability typical of radio magnetars .",
    "the dispersion measure derived from parkes observations at 10 cm , @xmath58pc@xmath6 , is the highest ever measured for a radio pulsar , and implies a distance of @xmath88.3kpc @xcite .",
    "the relatively high @xmath59 of compared with the deep limit of its quiescent emission derived by several ms of _ chandra _ observations ( @xmath60 in the 210kev range ; @xcite ) supports the predictions of the fundamental plane for radio magnetars @xcite .      the difference between the column densities of ( see section  [ spectra ] ) and sgra@xmath0 @xcite translates into @xmath612  ( at 90% confidence level ) .",
    "given that the central molecular zone ( cmz ) has a particle density @xmath62@xmath63 @xcite , this yields an upper limit on the distance between the two sources @xmath64 2pc .    and",
    "sgra@xmath0 relative distance ranges between that implied by their angular separation on the sky , @xmath65pc , and @xmath66pc . with an estimated neutron star density in the galactic disc @xmath67 pc@xmath68 @xcite",
    ", we expect @xmath8 0.2 neutron stars in a cone of aperture @xmath69 which encompasses the galactic center , and reaches out to the rim of the galaxy ( assumed distance from the sun is 20kpc ) .",
    "this estimate comprises all neutron stars born during the galaxy lifetime , in about 1 gyr .",
    "the probability of  being a neutron star wandering across the line of sight , with an age @xmath709kyr , and lying at such a small angular distance from sgra@xmath71 is then @xmath8@xmath72 .",
    "this makes the possibility that is a foreground or background object quite unlikely .    on the other hand , estimates of the neutron star population in the galaxy",
    "@xcite suggest that there are about @xmath73 neutron stars within 1pc from the galactic center .",
    "since this is the total population born during the entire lifetime of the galaxy ( about a gyr ) , a new neutron star is born in the same region every @xmath74yr .",
    "even on an observational ground alone , about 80 ordinary radio pulsars @xcite are expected to be visible with 1pc from sgra@xmath0 , compatible with us seeing only one young radio pulsar with a characteristic age @xmath7510kyr .",
    "the magnetar nature of this young radio pulsar so close to sgra@xmath0 suggests that there might possibly be as many magnetars as ordinary pulsars in the galaxy @xcite , and/or the galactic center region is a favorable place for magnetar formation , possibly because of its high density of very massive stars .",
    "the projected position of  places it within the disk of young and massive stars observed within 0.5pc of sgra@xmath0 @xcite , which is most likely its birthplace ( see fig.[field ] ) .",
    "is probably the end product of one of the young massive stars born during a recent star formation activity within the dense gaseous disk around sgra@xmath0 , now accreted into the black hole @xcite .",
    "the probability of  being in a bound orbit around sgra@xmath0 depends on the distance and the kick velocity of the neutron star at birth . in order to estimate the probability that  is in a bound orbit around sgra@xmath0",
    ", we performed numerical simulations by integrating the equations of motion in the gravitational potential of the central black hole for a large number ( @xmath8@xmath76 ) of stars ; newtonian gravity was assumed throughout .",
    "for each orbit the initial radial distance @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) was fixed and the star position on the sphere was selected by generating two uniform deviates .",
    "the modulus of the initial velocity was drawn from a gaussian distribution with specified standard deviation @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) ; the velocity direction was determined by generating two further uniform deviates .",
    "orbits were calculated in the time interval @xmath81 , where @xmath82 kyr is the estimated age of .",
    "stars which at @xmath83 are at a projected radial distance of 0.070.11pc are sorted according to the value of their total energy , @xmath84 .",
    "finally the fraction of bound orbits is computed as @xmath85 . since a large number of runs",
    "are required to explore with sufficiently small uncertainties the @xmath77 and @xmath79 ranges , we resorted to a 2d model , in which orbits are in the plane of the sky only .",
    "we checked that results from the 2d calculations are in good agreement with those of the complete 3d case for the present purposes .",
    "the monte carlo simulations are summarized in fig.[orbit ] , that shows the fraction of bound orbits as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath79 : if the magnetar was born within 1pc of sgra@xmath0 ( where most of the massive stars are located ) the probability of being in a bound orbit around the black hole is @xmath890% . for a circular orbit of radius 0.1pc ,",
    "the orbital period would be 1430yr , while the minimum orbital period would be 500yr with the pulsar being now at the apastron of a strongly eccentric orbit @xcite .",
    "orbital periods for different eccentricities and semi - major axes can reach periods of several kyrs .",
    "studies of the galactic center environment led to the discovery of fe k@xmath86 emission @xcite from molecular clouds within @xmath8300pc from sgra@xmath0 ( fig.[field ] ) .",
    "the fast variability of these fe emission features @xcite supports an interpretation in terms of irradiation from one or more radiation fronts passing through the different molecular clouds in the galactic center , emitted @xmath8100yr ago .",
    "the luminosity needed to explain the fe fluorescence can be calculated as @xmath87 erg  s@xmath4@xcite , where @xmath88 is a parameter taking into account flares with duration @xmath89 shorter than the cloud light - crossing time : @xmath90 .",
    "the total required fluence is then @xmath91@xmath14erg , where @xmath92110 yr is the light crossing time of the fastest echoing clouds @xcite .",
    "this energy could have been emitted by a powerful giant flare ( similar to the one observed from sgr180620 ; @xcite ) from about a century ago .",
    "unfortunately a reliable measure of the soft x - ray flux of the peak of sgr180620 s giant flare is not available @xcite , however for the sgr1900 + 14 s giant flare the study of the ionosphere disturbance could give an estimate of its 310kev flux as a factor of @xmath93 times the hard x - ray emission level @xcite .",
    "this is also in line with the idea of the softer component being due to the thermal emission from an expanding fireball , which in smaller scale bursts are observed to have a spectrum consistent with a blackbody with kt@xmath8710kev .",
    "the non - thermal hard x - ray emission during the flare peak is instead due to non - thermal processes deriving from the particle acceleration caused by the fireball .",
    "the @xmath94kev peak flux of sgr180620 s giant flare was estimated to be @xmath820 2 by geotail measurements ( the only instrument providing a good estimate of the first @xmath751s flare flux ; @xcite ) . assuming a distance of 15kpc @xcite",
    ", this translates in a luminosity ( @xmath9550kev ) of @xmath96 .",
    "a good guess of the 310kev emission during the sgr180620 s giant flare would then be about an order of magnitude higher luminosity , large enough to be the cause ( or a substantial part ) of the photon flux responsible for the observed fe emission .",
    "furthermore , the requirement that a very energetic event from  occurred @xmath8100 yr ago is compatible with the estimated outburst rate of a magnetar with such properties , which is approximately one every 50100 yrs @xcite .",
    "is the first pulsar discovered at a parsec distance from a supermassive black hole with a non - negligible probability of being in a bound orbit .",
    "future measurements of the magnetar proper motion and , possibly , spin - down variability ( the contribution to the magnetar observed @xmath97 due to the acceleration imparted by sgra@xmath0 s gravitational well can be up to @xmath98  ) , will be key in observing the effects of the supermassive black hole s gravitational potential on the magnetar s evolution .",
