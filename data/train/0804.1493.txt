    "in a multiple access relay ( mar ) channel , first introduced in @xcite , multiple users communicate with a single destination with the help of some relays .",

    "the diversity multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) , first introduced by zheng and tse in @xcite , is used .",
    "namely , the upper bound on the achievable dmt for the mar channel derived in @xcite is used to compare different strategies .    in the ddf strategy ,",
    "both users transmit their information symbols throughout an entire block , the relay decodes the information it receives only when it has a sufficient information for a correct detection .",
    "then the relay re - encodes the message and transmits it to the destination .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the ddf protocol achieves the optimal dmt for low multiplexing gains while being suboptimal for high multiplexing gains . in the cf protocol , the relay uses source coding to compress its received signal and forward it to the destination .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this communication strategy achieves the optimal dmt for high multiplexing gains , but suffers from a diversity loss for a low multiplexing gain .    in this work ,",

    "in this paper , the authors focused on the special case of two users , one relay channel and highlighted the significant gains provided by the maf protocol and the complexity reduction it offers compared to previously proposed protocols .",
    "the two - user maf relay channel is equivalent to a _ virtual _ multi - antenna mac ( in fact mimo - mac , two transmit antennas per user in this case ) .    in @xcite , grtner and",
    "blcskei presented a detailed analysis of the mac based on the different error types that can be encountered in this channel and derived the space - time code design criteria for multiantenna macs .",
    "moreover , they showed that their code design criteria are optimal with respect to the dmt of the channel , @xcite , and proved that , for a mimo - mac , outage analysis allows a rigorous characterization of the dominant error event regions . in other words , outage and error probabilities",
    "have the same behaviors . based on this fundamental result , we presented in a previous work @xcite an optimal space - time coding scheme for the mimo - mac .",
    "our main contribution , here , is a new construction of a family of optimal space - time block codes for the two - user , single relay maf relay channel inspired by the code designed for the mimo - mac and based on the dmt of this channel derived in @xcite .",
    "recall that the users ca nt cooperate together , hence , without any confusion , in the sequel , the terminology `` cooperative '' and `` non - cooperative '' simply represent channels with and without relay , respectively .",

    "let @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 be the number of antennas at the transmitters , the relay and the destination , respectively .",

    "the simplicity of this protocol is its main advantage , in contrast to other protocols , such as the ddf and cf defined previously , that add a significant complexity to the relaying terminal .",
    "in addition to the simplicity of the maf , authors showed that the proposed protocol outperforms both the ddf in the high multiplexing regime and the cf protocol in the low multiplexing regime .",

    "an upper bound on the optimal diversity gain for the symmetric two single - antenna users mar channel with @xmath10 received antennas is given in ( [ eq : dmt - gen ] ) using a simple min - cut max - flow examination of the scheme in figure [ fig : marc ] as in @xcite .",

    "this comparison reveals the significant advantage that multiple users can potentially gain from a single maf relay and shows that the maf protocol achieves the optimal dmt for @xmath85 , @xcite .",
    "it also shows the suboptimality of the time - sharing strategy .",
    "note that , if time - sharing is considered , the system without cooperation is equivalent to a point - to - point scheme .",
    "however , with cooperation , the maf protocol is equivalent to the non - orthogonal amplify - forward ( naf ) protocol @xcite .",
    "our goal is to construct a space - time code that achieves the optimal dmt of the two - user maf relay channel .",
    "@xmath86\\label{eq : xi}\\ ] ]    for the two - user maf relay channel , we propose the following code .",
    "we first design each user s mother codeword .",
    "this design aims to construct the golden code on the base field @xmath87 @xcite instead of the base field @xmath61 .",

    "( sketch ) if one of the users ( say user @xmath106 ) is not in error , then the receiver can cancel the signal it receives from this user and the system is equivalent to a single - user single - relay cooperative system .",
    "the maf protocol is , in this case , equivalent to the non - orthogonal amplify - and - forward ( naf ) , @xcite .",
    "user @xmath107 s codeword @xmath108 is given in ( [ eq : codeword - k-2 ] ) and is simply equivalent to the distributed golden code of @xcite which is known to be an dmt achieving space - time block code for the single - relay single - antenna naf channel .",
    "if both users are in error , the mother codewords are those of @xcite .",
    "thus , the proposed code is dmt achieving .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results obtained by monte - carlo simulations . we assume that the power is allocated equally so that no a - priori advantage is given to any link over another one .",
    "we first compare the outage performance of the maf relay channel to the time - sharing strategy where the channel is shared among the users in an orthogonal multiple - access manner .",
    "we also consider the non - cooperative scenario in both multiple - access and time - sharing cases to highlight the benefit of the relay .",
    "the performance of the proposed scheme is then measured by the word error rate ( wer ) _ vs _ received @xmath28 and compared to the time sharing scheme .    at the receiver side , we use ( when needed ) an mmse - dfe preprocessing combined with lattice decoding as a way to tackle the problem of the rank deficiency resulting from @xmath11 being smaller than @xmath109 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that an appropriate combination of left , right preprocessing and lattice decoding , yields significant saving in complexity with very small degredation with respect to the ml performance .",
    "outage performance of the two - user channel is illustrated in figures [ fig : po-2 ] ( with @xmath110 ) and [ fig : po-4 ] ( with @xmath111 ) for different spectral efficiencies , @xmath112 and @xmath113 bpcu , respectively .",
    "both non - cooperative and cooperative systems are considered for two different access strategies : simultaneous transmission ( multi - access ma ) and orthogonal access ( time - sharing ts ) .",
    "this study gives the theoretical limit of the channel in each scenario and will be used as an analysis tool to evaluate the performance of coding schemes .",
    "two important observations can be made : in the high @xmath28 regime , as in the single user case , the existence of a relay helping the users to reach the destination offers a significant gain in both multi - access and time - sharing schemes .",
    "compared to the time - sharing scenario , the multi - access scenario achieves the same diversity order but offers a significant gain , in both cooperative and non - cooperative channels , that increases with the spectral efficiency .",
    "now , we consider the new coding scheme whose performance is shown in figures [ fig : pe-4 ] and [ fig : pe-16 ] . in the first one ,",
    "the number of receive antennas is set to @xmath107 , whereas in the second one it is set to @xmath106 in order to simplify the decoding .",
    "compared to the time - sharing scheme , the proposed code achieves the same diversity order ( 2 for @xmath110 and 3 for @xmath111 ) but offers a significant performance gain that depends on the spectral efficiency of the system . in order to highlight this dependence on @xmath114 ,",
    "users information symbols are carved from different qam constellations , _",
    "e.g. _ 4-qam and a 16-qam for the coded scheme ( 16-qam and 256-qam , repectively , for the time - sharing scheme ) . at wer = @xmath115 , a gain of @xmath116 db",
    "is observed when a 4-qam constellation is considered .",
    "when we increase the spectral efficiency ( 16-qam ) , this gain increases to @xmath117 db .",
    "interestingly , if we compare the performance of the coded scheme to the outage performance of the channel , the same behavior can be observed .",
