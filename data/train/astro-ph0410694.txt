    "messier 82 ( ngc 3034 , cigar galaxy ) is known as one of the nearby ( 3.9 mpc ; * ? ? ? * ) , bright irregular galaxies , and , therefore , has been studied by many authors , at many wavelengths , and over many years .",
    "optical observations @xcite show remarkable features of kpc - scale filaments extending above and below the disk of this galaxy .",
    "soft x - ray @xcite , molecular gas @xcite , and dust @xcite observations also show filamentary structures outside the disk region .",
    "these observations suggest that the filamentary structures are the result of explosions , which occurred within the nuclear region .",
    "the mass - to - luminosity ratio , @xmath5 , of this galaxy is extremely low ( @xmath6 , @xcite ; @xmath7 , @xcite ) as compared with normal galaxies ( @xmath8 , * ? ? ? * ) and can be explained by bursts of star formation or a starburst @xcite .",
    "the starburst in m82 is believed to be triggered by a tidal interaction with the nearby two - armed spiral galaxy m81 .",
    "neutral hydrogen ( ) emission observation toward the m81 group shows that there is a tidal bridge between m81 and m82 , suggesting that there is a close encounter between these two galaxies @xmath9 years ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optical and near - infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations toward the disk region ( @xmath10 kpc outside from the galactic center ) of m82 indicate that the starburst occurred at this region @xmath9 years ago , corresponds to the episode of the tidal interaction with m81 @xcite .",
    "since the present starburst region is located at the center , they suggested that the global starburst in m82 has propagated inward from the disk to the nuclear regions .",
    "the evolution of starburst at the nuclear 500 pc region is , on the other hand , still unclear .",
    "some authors suggest the nuclear starburst propagated outward ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and some inward ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interferometric molecular gas observations show an arc - like deviation from rigid rotation in position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams at @xmath11 pc westward from the galactic nucleus , and this deviation implies the existence of an expanding molecular superbubble @xcite .",
    "the existence of the superbubble was confirmed by imaging the shell - like structure with the size of 260 pc @xmath1 170 pc @xcite .",
    "the age and the total energy of the superbubble are estimated to be about @xmath12 yr and @xmath13 ergs , which corresponds to the total energy of @xmath14 supernovae . at the center of the superbubble",
    ", there is a `` 2.2 @xmath15 m secondary peak '' ( a primary peak corresponds to the nucleus ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is dominated by luminous supergiants @xcite . since luminous supergiants are the late phase of ob stars , it is reasonable to suppose that a starburst has occurred at this near - infrared peak in the recent past",
    "actually , calculations of the initial mass function of this peak suggest that the number of supernovae , which have already exploded within the age of the superbubble , can explain the total energy of the superbubble .",
    "it is therefore concluded that this superbubble has been produced as a result of localized starburst at the `` 2.2 @xmath16 secondary peak '' @xcite .",
    "detailed information about the nature of starburst in this region is , however , still not clear , because the central region of m82 is deeply obscured by dust even in the k - band ( e.g. , @xmath17 , @xcite ; @xmath18 , @xcite ; @xmath19 , @xcite : these correspond to @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively , if we assume @xmath23 ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence it is very hard to derive detailed information  such as the precise flux of recombination lines  in the optical or near - infrared .    on the other hand ,",
    "100 ghz continuum observations are generally dominated by the free - free emission and would not be affected by the dust absorption , as is the case for optical or near - infrared observations .",
    "in fact , spectral energy distribution ( sed ) studies from the infrared to radio wavelength region of m82 indicates that the 100 ghz continuum emission in m82 is dominated by free - free emission @xcite . a detailed sed study for small - scale structures toward the central region of m82 by @xcite based on their millimeter and centimeter interferometric ( bima and vla ) observations concluded that the free - free emission dominates even in the small - scale structures of 100 ghz continuum emission ( i.e. , 100 ghz continuum emission from all the peaks are dominated by free - free emission ) .",
    "hence , 100 ghz continuum observations can have great advantages for the observation of the central starburst regions in m82 , where a large amount of dust exists .",
    "in this paper , we report the structures and properties of the present starburst regions and environment in m82 with our high spatial resolution 100 ghz observations and compare them with previously published data .",
    "we also discuss the triggering of new starbursts by the past energetic starburst and the resultant superbubble expansion , namely , self - induced starburst .",
    "we obtained aperture synthesis 100 ghz continuum images toward the central region of m82 with the nobeyama millimeter array during 1997 december  1998 april .",
    "three ( ab , c , and d ) configurations of six 10 m antennas , equipped with tunerless sis receivers @xcite , were used for the observations . as back - end",
    ", we used an xf - type spectro - correlator ultra wide band correlator ( uwbc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has a 1 ghz bandwidth and a 6 ghz intermediate frequency .",
    "since the uwbc can process both the upper side band ( usb ) and the lower side band ( lsb ) , our continuum data were obtained from the usb of the hcn(1  0 ) observations ( the rest frequency of the hcn j = 1  0 line is 88.632 ghz , and the observed frequency is 88.884 ghz ) .",
    "hence the central frequency of the continuum observations corresponds to 100.884 ghz .",
    "the band - pass calibration was done with 3c273 , and 0923 + 392 was observed every 10 minutes as a phase and amplitude calibrator .",
    "the flux scale of 0923 + 392 was determined by comparisons with mars and uranus . the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale is estimated to be @xmath24 20% .",
    "the data were reduced using the nro software package `` uvproc ii '' @xcite , and the final maps were made and cleaned with the nrao software aips .",
    "we analyzed the 100 ghz continuum data with uniform @xmath25 weighting at the clean process , and the resultant resolution was @xmath0 ( 43 pc @xmath1 36 pc at d = 3.9 mpc ) .",
    "we note that this linear scale of the beam size is similar to the typical diameter of a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) .",
    "the 100 ghz continuum map made with uniform @xmath25 weighting is shown in figure  [ fig - uni - cont ] .",
    "we defined a `` peak '' as ( 1 ) detected in the map with @xmath26 or more and ( 2 ) separated from other peaks by more than one beam width .",
    "we found seven peaks in the map ( peaks a  g in the figure ) , and all peaks were aligned along the galactic disk ( position angle or p.a .  of 76 ) .",
    "the four strongest peaks , d ",
    "g , correspond to the two strongest peaks in the previously published lower spatial resolution 100 ghz continuum images @xcite .",
    "other weaker peaks in our map correspond to those in the previously published images .",
    "note that our lower resolution ( @xmath27 ) and higher signal - to - noise ratio map ( i.e. , natural @xmath25 weighting map ; not shown in this paper ) is consistent with other published results .",
    "since the uniform @xmath25 weighting increases the noise level of the map , the diffuse extended emission may be masked by the noise , and the total flux of the 100 ghz continuum emission may decrease compared with the natural @xmath25 weighting image .",
    "however , the total flux of the uniform @xmath25 weighting map is , in fact , @xmath24 80% of that of the natural @xmath25 weighting map , which suggests that most of the flux is not missing . on the other hand ,",
    "the total flux of our natural @xmath25 weighting map is 0.43 jy , and the missing flux compared with the single - dish flux ( @xmath24 0.54 jy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath24 20% , which is almost comparable with the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale .",
    "we therefore did not recover the missing flux and conclude that the high spatial resolution starburst properties , as reported here , are accurate at the 30% level .",
    "figure  [ fig - cont - co ] shows the @xmath28co(1  0 ) superbubble image ( contour map ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) overlaid on the 100 ghz continuum image ( colorscale map ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the possible oval structure of the superbubble .",
    "this figure shows that _ the four brightest peaks ( d - g ) in the 100 ghz continuum image are located at the inner edge of the molecular superbubble along the galactic disk of m82 .",
    "_ we also made an 100 ghz continuum intensity plot of the superbubble sliced along the major axis ( p.a .",
    "= 76 ) , namely along the galactic disk , of the galaxy to compare with that of the @xmath28co emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig - slice ] ) .",
    "the continuum emission has a double - peaked structure in the plot : the intensity is weak at the center of the superbubble ( around zero offset in the figure ) and has peaks at both sides of the bubble center , which are located around @xmath29 offsets .",
    "the plot of the @xmath28co emission also shows a double - peaked structure .",
    "the emission is weak at the center of the bubble , but peaks are located around @xmath30 , outside the peaks of the continuum emission .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the 100 ghz emission is located at the inner edge of the molecular superbubble .    since the 100 ghz continuum emission in m82",
    "is dominated by free - free emission , even in small - scale structures ( see  [ intro ] ) , these 100 ghz continuum emitting regions represent starburst regions .",
    "this distribution , therefore , strongly suggests that the present starburst regions in m82 are concentrated at the inner edge of the molecular superbubble .",
    "the 100 ghz continuum emission in m82 is dominated by free - free emission , as mentioned above , so that the strength of the emission is directly related to star formation activities like h@xmath2 emission at optical wavelength .",
    "furthermore , 100 ghz continuum emission does not be affected by the dust absorption like the h@xmath2 emission .",
    "figure  [ fig - cont - ha ] shows the h@xmath2 image ( colroscale map ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) overlaid on the 100 ghz continuum image ( contour map ) .",
    "the map clearly shows that the brightest 100 ghz continuum peaks are totally obscured by dust in the h@xmath2 image , indicating that 100 ghz continuum observation is a strong tool to image the active starburst regions directly .",
    "we therefore use the 100 ghz continuum emission flux ( i.e. , absorption - free free - free emission flux ) , @xmath31 , to estimate the production rates of lyman continuum photons , @xmath32 .",
    "the absorption - free @xmath32 can be calculated as @xmath33}\\right )      \\sim1.8\\times10^{51 }      \\left(\\frac{t_{\\rm e}}{10^{4}~{\\rm [ k]}}\\right)^{-0.45 }      \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{{\\rm 100.88~[ghz]}}\\right)^{0.1 }      \\left(\\frac{d}{{\\rm 3.9~[mpc]}}\\right)^{2 }      \\left(\\frac{s_{\\rm t}}{{\\rm [ mjy]}}\\right ) , \\label{eq - nly}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the electron temperature and the observation frequency , respectively @xcite .",
    "we adopted @xmath36 mpc @xcite for the distance of m82 . since radio recombination line observations toward the central region of m82 suggest that @xmath34 of the ionized gas ( different from hot plasma which can be seen in x - ray emission ) ranges between @xmath245,000 k and @xmath2410,000 k @xcite , we used @xmath34 = 5,000 k and 10,000 k for the calculations .",
    "we substitute the peak flux density of the 100 ghz continuum averaged over the beam size of @xmath0 ( 43 pc @xmath1 36 pc ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq - nly ] ) , and derived @xmath32 at the specific regions ( peaks a - g in fig .",
    "[ fig - uni - cont ] ) in m82 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath32 in the present star forming regions averaged over the linear scale of about @xmath37 pc are as high as @xmath38 photons s@xmath39 for the four strong peaks ( d  g ; the western side of the nucleus ) and @xmath40 photons s@xmath39 for other weaker peaks ( the eastern side of the nucleus ) .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath32 is about @xmath41 photons s@xmath39 , which corresponds to @xmath42 statistical uncertainty in the continuum map .    to find out the validity of our estimation of @xmath32",
    ", we compared our estimation with those of infrared observations . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath43 aperture size @xmath32 using their br@xmath44 image , which is corrected for extinction of @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath32 at their position b2 , which corresponds to our peak d , is @xmath46 photons s@xmath39 , consistent with that of peak d of @xmath47 photons s@xmath39 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "@xcite also estimated @xmath32 using their br@xmath44 image , corrected for reddening of about @xmath48 .",
    "they found 12 point - like sources at the central 500 pc region using an extinction corrected k - band image , and calculated for @xmath32 with @xmath49 aperture size , similar to our beam size .",
    "@xmath32 values for the eastern side of the nucleus show @xmath50 , and those of western side show @xmath51 .",
    "the tendency that @xmath32 of the western side is about twice as strong as that of the eastern side is the same as our results .",
    "their absolute values are , however , a factor of a few smaller than our estimation and that of @xcite .",
    "this inconsistency maybe due to their smaller reddening correction . in summary , our @xmath32 estimation using 100 ghz continuum flux and that using infrared emission line data are consistent each other .",
    "in the previous section , we show that the present starburst regions are strongly concentrated at the inner edge of the expanding molecular superbubble . in this section , we discuss the starburst activities , environment , and history around the superbubble .",
    "since the linear scale of our beam size is comparable to those of gmcs , it is worth comparing the star forming activity around the superbubble in m82 with those in active star forming gmcs in our galaxy and nearby galaxies using @xmath32 .",
    "free - free continuum emission is , however , optically thin at 100 ghz , so there may exist some overlap of the starburst regions , since m82 is an edge - on galaxy .",
    "we therefore evaluated the effect of overlapping based on the structure of the superbubble and estimated that a few gmcs can overlap at peaks d and g , since the shell structure is parallel to the line - of - sight .",
    "however , there may be none at peaks e and f , which are close to the bubble center ( i.e. , the shell structure is perpendicular to the line - of - sight ) .",
    "there is also a possibility that starburst regions around the superbubble overlap with starburst regions in the background disk .",
    "this possibility is , however , very small , because stars are formed from molecular gas , and almost all the molecular gas toward the superbubble is dynamically associated with it @xcite .",
    "in addition , radio recombination lines , which also trace star forming regions , toward the superbubble are also dynamically associated with it ( see  [ dis - inducesb - ion ] ) .",
    "these discussions indicate that peaks e and f are starburst regions at the inner edge of the superbubble with no overlap , and we therefore compare @xmath32 at peaks e and f with those at active star forming gmcs in our galaxy and nearby galaxies .    at peaks",
    "e and f , @xmath32 are @xmath52 and @xmath53 photons s@xmath39 for @xmath34 = 5,000 k and @xmath54 and @xmath55 photons s@xmath39 for @xmath34 = 10,000 k , respectively ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "these @xmath32 are an order of magnitude higher than those of active star forming regions in our galaxy : the most massive and luminous optically visible giant region ngc 3603 @xcite , which is @xmath21 kpc away from the galactic center , has @xmath32 of @xmath56 photons",
    "s@xmath39 @xcite . the region complex g@xmath57 in one of the most luminous star forming regions w51 , which is 7.6 kpc away from the galactic center @xcite , has @xmath32 of @xmath58 photons",
    "s@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the diameters of these regions are about 50 pc and 30 pc , respectively @xcite , which are almost the same linear scale as peaks e and f. this comparison indicates that the ongoing starburst regions in m82 are at least 30 times more active in terms of ionizing flux than the active star forming regions in our galaxy .",

    "the fraction of the sizes of regions peak around @xmath65 pc , which is independent of their locations ( including nuclear , arm , and interarm regions ) .",

    "pc show an order of magnitude lower than the starburst gmcs in m82 .",
    "comparisons between starburst gmcs in m82 and star forming gmcs in our galaxy , m51 , and ic 342 suggest that the star formation in m82 is quantitatively different from those in our galaxy , m51 and ic 342 , namely , m82 has an order of magnitude higher star formation efficiency in gmc scale .",
    "recent high angular resolution optical and near infrared observations toward nearby galaxies show many super star clusters ( sscs ) with their size at most 10 pc .",
    "our observations are limited by the beam size of @xmath37 pc , thus we can not compare them directly .",
    "it will be interesting to perform sub - arcsec resolution ( @xmath67 pc ) 100 ghz continuum observations toward these starburst regions in m82 to resolve sscs and compare with those of other galaxies in the future .",
    "these observations may help to understand what causes the qualitative differences between starburst gmcs in m82 and star forming gmcs in our galaxy and nearby galaxies .      in the previous section , we estimated the production rates of lyman continuum photons ( @xmath32 ) from the ongoing starburst regions in m82 .",
    "based on this information , it is possible to estimate the stellar compositions in the starburst regions by assuming a mass function ( mf ) .",
    "we adopted an extended millar - scalo mf of @xmath68 with lower and upper mass limits of 1 and 100 m@xmath69 @xcite . to estimate the total @xmath32 from all the stars calculated from the mf",
    ", the value of @xmath32 from stars with each stellar mass is needed .",
    "we used the stellar model of @xcite , who calculated @xmath32 for the o - type and early b - type stars , and their evolutionary mass model ( stellar mass derived from an evolutionary track ) for the luminosity class v ( main sequence ) .",
    "the reason for using this class is the following : since the ongoing starburst regions are located just at the inner edge of the superbubble , and these seem to be induced by the past starburst that made the superbubble ( see  [ dis - inducesb ] ) , it is reasonable to suppose that the present starburst regions are younger than the expanding timescale of the superbubble .",
    "the age of the superbubble is about @xmath12 years @xcite ; hence the starburst should have occurred on less than this timescale , which is similar to or less than the lifetime of early - type stars .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to assume that all the stars in the present starburst regions are still on the main sequence .    since the calculations of the stellar model in @xcite are done with each spectral type , we interpolated their @xmath32 for the smaller interval of the stellar mass with fourth - order polynomial fitting .",
    "the fitting residual is 1.2% , which is much smaller than other errors ( e.g. , statistical noise and absolute flux error of our observations ) . the extrapolations for very massive stars and for late - type stars ( later than late b - type stars )",
    "were done with the same function as the interpolation . using this `` interpolated / extrapolated @xmath32 - stellar mass '' relation and the mf explained above , we calculated the stellar compositions for each starburst region ( peaks a - g ) . the calculated stellar numbers with mass larger than 8 m@xmath69 , which are the progenitors of supernovae , are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we also estimated the dependence of mf slopes and stellar mass limits .",
    "if we apply a steeper mf of @xmath70 , which is close to the slope of miller - scalo solar neighborhood mf of -3.3 @xcite , the calculated @xmath71 m@xmath69 stellar numbers will increase about a factor of 2 .",
    "on the other hand , if we apply a shallower mf of @xmath72 , the calculated @xmath71 m@xmath69 stellar numbers will decrease about a factor of 2 .",
    "if we lower the upper mass limit to 50 m@xmath69 , the calculated @xmath71 m@xmath69 stellar numbers will increase about a factor of 2 .",
    "changing the lower mass limit affects to the calculations only slightly , since low mass stars emit small amounts of lyman continuum photons .",
    "@xcite computed the starburst model for m82 , and concluded that the mf model of @xmath70 with the upper mass limit of 80 m@xmath69 will fit their observations the best .",
    "@xcite also performed starburst model calculations , and found out that their data are consistent with the mf model of @xmath73 with the upper mass limit of @xmath74 m@xmath69 . in either case",
    ", the difference between our and their mf models will not produce an order of magnitude difference in the calculated @xmath71 m@xmath69 stellar numbers .",
    "there is also a possibility that the superbubble expansion timescale is longer than the previous estimation of @xmath12 years .",
    "this timescale is calculated with [ the size of the superbubble]/[expansion velocity ] , but if the acceleration of the molecular gas to the present expansion velocity is gradual ( i.e. , if the expansion velocity is slow when the superbubble is small ) , the expansion timescale should be longer than the estimation .",
    "if this is the case , some of the highest mass stars should have already been exploded by supernovae , and this effect should be considered in the mf calculations .",
    "this effect corresponds to lowering the upper mass limit of the mf calculations and , therefore , increasing the @xmath71 m@xmath69 stellar numbers . the superbubble expansion timescale shorter than @xmath12 years can also be possible , due to the deceleration of the expanding velocity @xcite . in this case , the timescale is shorter than the age of the high - mass ( ob type ) stars , and we can assume that there are no supernova explosions in the past .",
    "therefore , this case does not affect any mf calculations .",
    "it is interesting to find out whether the present starburst is more active than the past starburst that made the molecular superbubble . in order to compare the energetics of the present starburst with that of the molecular superbubble",
    ", we calculated @xmath75 m@xmath69 stars , whose lifetime corresponds to the dynamical timescale of the superbubble of @xmath76 years , at peaks e and f. we found @xmath77 stars for @xmath34 = 5,000 k and @xmath78 stars for @xmath34 = 10,000 k , which corresponds to about @xmath79 supernova explosions with a total energy release of @xmath80 ergs .",
    "the efficiency of the supernova explosion energy input to the bubbles / chimneys varies .",
    "a single supernova explosion releases its energy to the surrounding ism with an efficiency of @xmath81% , depending on the density of the ism @xcite .",
    "multiple supernova explosions , on the other hand , release their energy into the ism more efficiently , with up to 20% of their total energy @xcite .",
    "if we take the efficiency of @xmath82 , bubbles / chimneys with energy of @xmath83 ergs will be produced at peaks e and f in the future , which is similar to the observed bubbles in our galaxy or nearby galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this energy is , however , a few orders of magnitude lower than that of the molecular superbubble in m82 ( @xmath13 ergs ; * ? ? ? * ) and suggests that the present starburst regions are less active than the starburst that made the molecular superbubble",
    ".    this possibility may not be the case if the expansion timescale of the superbubble is longer than expected .",
    "the longer timescale increases the energy release from the present starburst regions owing to the increase in the number of supernovae ( see  [ dis - mf - calc ] ) . the energy input into the surrounding ism , therefore , would be closer to the energy of the present superbubble .",
    "molecular emission from the superbubble is strong in the southern part , but weak in the northern part . on the other hand , the images of atomic and ionized gas  absorption line @xcite , radio recombination line ( h41@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and forbidden line ( [ ] ; @xcite )  show stronger intensity from the northern part than from the southern part ( fig .",
    "[ fig - pv]a ; see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shell - like structure detected in the 408 mhz continuum by @xcite clearly shows the complete superbubble structure .",
    "these results seem to indicate that _ the superbubble is not disrupted yet _ , and the southern part of the superbubble is dominated by molecular gas and the northern part by atomic and ionized gas .",
    "the reason for this asymmetry is not clear .",
    "one possibility is that the explosions , which made the superbubble , have occurred preferentially north of the galactic disk .",
    "this initial condition suggests that the southern part is rich in molecular gas , but the northern part is not , so that the latter is more likely to be dominated by atomic and ionized gas ( i.e. , less molecular gas and/or less self - shielding of the molecular gas ) .",
    "indeed , the large - scale ( kpc - scale ) h@xmath2 image of m82 shows that the southern outflow is relatively confined to the minor axis of the galaxy , but the northern outflow has a wider opening angle .",
    "this difference suggests that the starburst is located slightly north of the galactic disk , and the material distribution asymmetry causes the different collimations in the northern and southern outflows @xcite . such asymmetry in the structure of bubbles",
    "can also be seen in other galaxies ( e.g. , our galaxy , @xcite ; m101 , @xcite ) , although their low - density regions are thought to be already disrupted .",
    "we compared the position - velocity ( pv ) diagram of molecular gas with that of a radio recombination line ( h41@xmath2 ; * ? ? ? * ) and found that _ the deviation from the rigid rotation of the recombination line is larger than that of the molecular gas _",
    "[ fig - pv]b ) .",
    "similar deviation difference is also seen in the comparison between the molecular gas and the [ ] line @xcite .",
    "since the deviation is evidence of the superbubble expansion @xcite , the ionized gas is kinematically related to the superbubble , but moves faster than the neutral gas .",
    "we compiled all the observed oh and h@xmath3o masers toward m82 @xcite and found that _ the masers are obviously concentrated at the 100 ghz continuum emitting regions , namely , the intense starburst regions _",
    "[ fig - cont - co ] ) .",
    "in addition , we overplotted the masers on the pv diagram of molecular gas and found that _ the oh and h@xmath3o masers are strongly concentrated at the superbubble with good velocity coincidences _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig - pv]b ) . pumping mechanisms for oh masers",
    "are collisions ( @xmath84 shocks ) and/or ir / uv radiation ( @xmath84 radiation from regions ) , and those for h@xmath3o masers are basically shocks @xcite .",
    "indeed , observations of our galaxy indicate that these masers can be seen around regions @xcite and at the shock fronts of supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "furthermore , masers in m82 are not so luminous as megamasers around agns , but much more similar to the galactic sources @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent interferometric sio line observations toward the superbubble suggest that the sio line may trace shocked regions , and the shocked regions may locate the inner wall of the superbubble @xcite , consistent with our result .      both inside and outside the superbubble",
    ", various x - ray sources can be seen from soft / medium ( @xmath85 kev ) to hard components ( @xmath86 kev ) .",
    "the soft and medium components show extended structures , which are believed to originate from hot thermal plasma @xcite .",
    "the soft component corresponds well with the large - scale ionized gas outflows @xcite .",
    "however , the medium component is much more concentrated @xcite , and its peak position is located at the center of the superbubble @xcite .",
    "most of the hard component , on the other hand , comes from point sources @xcite , which are thought to be neutron stars , stellar - mass black holes , and an intermediate - mass black hole @xcite .",
    "some fraction of the hard component , however , comes from a diffuse source with an extent of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig - co - xray ] shows the diffuse hard x - ray image ( thick contour map ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) overlaid on the the @xmath28co(1  0 ) superbubble image ( thin contour with greyscale map ; * ? ?",
    "the diffuse hard x - ray emission is extended toward the center of the galaxy , but the peak is located inside of the molecular superbubble . since the diffuse hard x - ray data do not have any line - of - sight information , we do not know where is the actual location(s ) of the emitting source(s ) , but clearly there is some source toward the inner part of the superbubble .",
    "this position correspondence suggests that some of the diffuse hard x - ray component locates inside the superbubble .",
    "this component could be due to hot thermal plasma @xcite , which is also supported by 408 mhz observations ( free - free absorption has been detected at the superbubble ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the possibility of inverse compton scattering can not be ruled out @xcite . assuming that the diffuse hard x - ray component is caused by hot thermal plasma , we can calculate the velocity of the plasma . the sound speed , i.e.",
    ", the velocity , of protons , @xmath88 , in the plasma can be expressed as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath91 is temperature ( k ) , and @xmath92 is the proton mass . since the plasma temperature , @xmath93 , is estimated as @xmath94 kev @xcite , the velocity can be calculated as @xmath95 km s@xmath39 .",
    "this number is @xmath96 times faster than the expansion velocity of the superbubble , hence the superbubble should be closed and the plasma should be overpressurized , if the plasma is in the superbubble .",
    "indeed , the superbubble seems to be closed (  [ dis - inducesb - struct ] ) , and @xcite suggest that the plasma seems to be overpressurized .",
    "in addition , the expansion velocity of the ionized gas in the superbubble is faster than that of the molecular gas , and masers are concentrated at the superbubble (  [ dis - inducesb ] ) .",
    "these support the idea that the some of the diffuse hard x - ray component is located inside the superbubble .",
    "as mentioned above , the possibility that the diffuse hard x - ray component might originate from inverse compton scattering can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "if true , it indicates that nonthermal high - energy electrons are strongly concentrated inside the superbubble , because the diffuse hard x - ray emission peaks at there .",
    "the trapping mechanism of the nonthermal high - energy electrons is unclear , but the magnetic field in and around the superbubble may be playing an important role .      in summary",
    ", the expanding superbubble seems to be still closed , the overpressurized hot plasma may be filling inside of the superbubble , ionized gas is spatially and kinematically correlated with the expansion of superbubble but moves faster , the masers are also spatially and kinematically located at the inner edge of the superbubble , and the free - free emission is located at the inner edge of the superbubble .",
    "the configuration of plasma , ionized gas , and superbubble is very similar to that of the expanding supernova remnants in our galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; recombination lines that traces ionized gas emit from shock - heated gas and the gas evaporate from the surrounding material that forms shell structures .",
    "the faster velocity than the surrounding molecular superbubble and the existence of the masers support this idea .",
    "these structural and kinematical features therefore suggest that _ the hot plasma expanded the superbubble , created the shocked regions at the inner - edge of the superbubble , and induced the active starbursts at there .",
    "_    sequential star formation in molecular clouds induced by expanding ionized gas ( @xmath84 shocks ) has been suggested theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our galaxy",
    ", this sequential star formation has also been suggested observationally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , these observational papers suggest that the induced star forming regions tend to make more massive stars than isolated quiescent dark clouds .",
    "we therefore conclude that the present starburst ( massive star forming ) regions in m82 are induced in ways similar to those of the sequential star formation regions in our galaxy .    at the center of the superbubble ,",
    "on the other hand , there is almost no molecular gas emission , neither diffuse ( @xmath28co ) nor dense ( hcn ) , from both spatial and dynamical points of view ( figs .  [ fig - cont - co ] , [ fig - pv]b ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . furthermore , the 100 ghz continuum emission is also weak at this region compared to the inner edge of the superbubble ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - slice ] ) . since stars are believed to be made from molecular clouds , especially from dense parts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and free - free ( 100 ghz continuum ) emission is produced by massive stars , these suggest that the starburst at the center of the superbubble begins to cease , and the number of massive stars is decreasing by supernova explosions .    from these results and discussions , we propose an evolution of starburst around the superbubble in m82 .",
    "first , the energetic explosions occurred as a consequence of the localized starburst at the center of the superbubble @xcite .",
    "the resultant shock waves ionized the surrounding ism , produced the hot thermal plasma and ionized gas , and swept them outward .",
    "the neutral ism ( e.g. , molecular gas ) , had also been swept outward and produced the expanding molecular superbubble .",
    "most of the molecular gas at the central starburst region was blown away and/or ionized by the energetic explosions and/or by the strong uv radiation from massive stars , so that the starburst begins to cease .",
    "the expansion of the superbubble inside the galactic disk , which is rich in ism , had compressed the ism and caused a concentration around the superbubble .",
    "this concentration appears as double peaks by the edge - brightening effect @xcite , and these double peaks correspond to the well known `` central peak '' and the inner side of the `` sw lobe , '' which can be seen in molecular gas images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inner edge of this concentration is the shock front of the superbubble expansion , which caused the shocked regions and induced star forming regions in the molecular gas , and produced the masers and free - free continuum emissions at these regions .",
    "these induced star forming regions correspond to the present starburst regions in m82 .",
    "this result is the first clear evidence of self - induced starburst in an external galaxy .",
    "the size - scale of this self - induced starburst is rather small , about 200 pc , and located off from the nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - cont - co ] ) .",
    "this localized and offset self - induced starburst may be the cause of inconsistent conclusions of inward / outward starburst propagations ( see  [ intro ] ) . the detailed studies at various wavelengths with comparing the positions of superbubbles ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) will give us the detailed starburst propagation and evolution mechanisms .",
    "recent observations and model calculations suggest that the central region of m82 has experienced at least two starbursts within @xmath97 years .",
    "optical emission line study suggests that the large - scale outflows originate from at least two @xcite , maybe several @xcite different burst regions .",
    "model calculations based on infrared spectroscopic observations required two starbursts within @xmath97 years .",
    "the first starburst can be explained by the large - scale outflows and red supergiants , and the second one by the uv flux @xcite .",
    "the molecular and dust outflows , which can be seen in both interferometric @xcite and single - dish observations @xcite , extend not only from the superbubble region , but also everywhere from the molecular disk .",
    "our observations , on the other hand , show the past starburst , which has made the superbubble ( expansion timescale of @xmath98 years ;  [ dis - mf - calc ] ) , and the present induced starburst , which is believed to be younger than the expanding timescale of the superbubble (  [ dis - mf ] ) . in addition , the superbubble still has closed structure (  [ dis - inducesb - struct ] and [ dis - inducesb - xray ] ) .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations indicate that large - scale outflows are created by energetic starbursts that can produce superbubbles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these observations and simulations indicate that the energetic starbursts in m82 , which produced the large - scale outflows , occurred at least twice in this @xmath97 years , and the recent starbursts ( the starburst that made the superbubble and the present starburst ) occurred on an order - of - magnitude shorter timescale .",
    "these indications suggest that several starbursts had occurred in this @xmath97 years .",
    "it is not clear whether starbursts occurred intermittently or continously within @xmath76 years or shorter timescale .",
    "however , if you average over long timescale , say order of @xmath99 years , starburst in m82 seems occurring continuously , with the self - induced mechanism .",
    "this self - induced starburst would continue till most of the molecular gas is consumed by the star formation , blown away from the disk region of the galaxy , and/or is dissociated by strong uv radiation , and this timescale may correspond to the timescale of the whole starburst phenomena of @xmath99 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    these self - induced / self - regulating mechanisms would be very important for other starburst galaxies .",
    "recent optical spectroscopic and x - ray observations show that most of starburst galaxies have large - scale outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mid - infrared observations of starburst galaxies indicate that the timescale of most starbursts are @xmath4 years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results are consistent with those of m82 , and strongly suggest that most of the starbursts would have experienced similar starburst evolution as m82 .",
    "our new high spatial resolution 100 ghz continuum ( i.e. , free - free emission ) image in the central region of m82 clearly shows that present starburst regions are strongly concentrated at the inner edge of the expanding molecular superbubble .",
    "the lyman continuum photon numbers from the starburst regions ( i.e. , the strength of the starburst ) are an order of magnitude larger than those in the active high - mass star forming regions in our galaxy ( ngc 3603 and w51 ) and nearby galaxies ( ic 342 and m51 ) .",
    "the internal structure of the present superbubble , from the center , shows a red supergiant star cluster ( `` 2.2 @xmath15 m secondary peak '' ) , overpressurized hot thermal plasma or high energy electrons ( diffuse hard x - ray emission ) , high velocity ionized gas ( h41@xmath2 and [ ] ) , shocked molecular gas ( masers and sio emission ) and the present starburst regions ( free - free emission ) , and the expanding molecular superbubble located furthermost outside .",
    "this structure and the physical properties of these objects / mediums suggest that the present starburst has been induced by the past starburst that made the superbubble , namely , self - induced starburst .",
    "the existence of kpc - scale outflows , a few hundred parsec - scale superbubble , and induced starburst inside the superbubble suggest that the starbursts in m82 have occurred several times in this @xmath4 years .",
    "since the appearance of the starburst ( e.g. , outflows ) in m82 is typical in other starburst galaxies , this starburst mechanism will be very important for the studies of other starburst regions / galaxies and galaxy formation .",

    "<S> these observations suggest that a strong starburst produced energetic explosions and resultant plasma and superbubble expansions , and induced the present starburst regions traced by our 100 ghz continuum observations at the inner edge of the molecular superbubble . </S>",
    "<S> these results , therefore , provide the first clear evidence of self - induced starburst in external galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> starburst at the center of the superbubble , on the other hand , begins to cease because of a lack of molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of intense starburst seems to have occurred several times within @xmath4 years in the central region of m82 . </S>"
