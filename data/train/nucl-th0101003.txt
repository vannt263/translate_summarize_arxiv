    "the tucson - melbourne ( tm ) three - nucleon force due to two - pion exchange has a structure which , after an expansion of the invariant @xmath4n amplitudes in the inverse nucleon mass , was determined by the original implementation of chiral symmetry in the underlying @xmath4n scattering amplitude .",
    "given that structure , the strength constants ( the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 coefficients ) are then not free parameters but depend upon the @xmath4n scattering data base , which has improved greatly since the original determination of these coefficients .",
    "in this note , we review two recent developments in three - body force studies : i ) a critical analysis of the generic structure of a 2@xmath4 exchange three - body force ( tbf )  @xcite , and ii ) the new tm strength constants derived from invariant @xmath4n amplitudes  @xcite corresponding to the contemporary data base which includes measurements taken at the meson factories since 1980 .",
    "we make updated tbf s of the tucson - melbourne type which reflect one or both developments , add them to a nn force , and calculate properties of the triton in order to see the effect of these developments in a simple nuclear system .    to begin , we display the tucson - melbourne force ( leaving out an overall momentum conserving delta function ) :    @xmath5 + ( i \\vec { \\tau}_3 \\cdot \\vec { \\tau}_1 \\times \\vec { \\tau}_2 ) d ( i \\vec { \\sigma}_3 \\cdot { \\vec q } \\times { \\vec { q ' } } ) \\right\\ } \\ , , \\label{eq : wpipi } \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the pion rescatters from nucleon 3 .",

    "now we review briefly the origin of this equation .    the approach used in the tucson - melbourne ( tm ) family of forces is based upon applying the ward identities of current algebra to axial - vector nucleon scattering .",
    "the ward identities are saturated with nucleon and @xmath8 poles . then employing pcac ( partial conservation of the axial - vector current )",
    ", one can derive expressions for the on - mass - shell pion - nucleon scattering amplitudes  @xcite which map out satisfactorily the empirical coefficients of the hhler subthreshold crossing symmetric expansion based on dispersion relations @xcite and , after projection onto partial waves , describe the phase shifts reasonably well  @xcite .",
    "the off - mass - shell extrapolation ( needed for the exchange of virtual , spacelike pions in a nuclear force diagram ) is trivial for the @xmath3 coefficient .",
    "it can be taken directly from the on - mass - shell theoretical or empirical amplitude @xmath9 since they coincide so closely ( see appendix a of ref .",

    "this rewriting of the pcac / current algebra amplitude exploits a convenient correspondence between the structure of the terms corresponding to spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and the structure of the model @xmath12 term . to see this",
    ", we note that the nonspin flip @xmath13-channel isospin even amplitude ( covariant nucleon pole term removed ) is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pion - nucleon @xmath15 term , @xmath16 mev , and the invariant amplitude @xmath17 is given in units of the charged pion mass ( 139.6 mev ) .",

    "this term ( which also appears in the @xmath3 coefficient ) is representation dependent and is the only local term of a consistent set of 15 terms derived some time ago  @xcite .",
    "we note that the term proportional to @xmath51 did not appear before in eq .",
    "( [ eq : expan ] ) .",
    "this term nevertheless is inserted in @xmath2 because both the backward - propagating part of the nucleon pole @xmath52 and the @xmath12 couple with the pion with a ( assumed the same ) form factor @xmath53 which is defined as @xmath54 .",
    "the chiral breaking @xmath15 term has no intrinsic @xmath55 dependence ( although it is multiplied by @xmath56 ) .",
    "it is convenient , if not necessary , however , since part of the amplitude is due to @xmath52 and @xmath19 , to multiply the final amplitude by form factors , dependent upon @xmath55 and @xmath57 .",

    "this operator structure is reflected in the coordinate space representations where one always finds the coefficient @xmath64 multiplying derivatives of two  coordinate space yukawas \" : see , for example , eqs .",

    "@xcite or appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite . without a form factor @xmath63",
    "the short - range part would be a dirac delta function  a zero - range or contact term .",
    "the tucson - melbourne force has an ( unadorned by @xmath65 ) @xmath2 coefficient multiplying a derivative of a product of a delta function and a  coordinate space yukawa \" as is easily seen in the same equations .",
    "it was the latter , rather singular , aspect of the tucson - melbourne force which made numerical work difficult in both coordinate space and momentum space ( the operator structure is the same ) .",
    "in addition , the recent trend toward a low mass cutoff @xmath66 in @xmath67 for pion exchange highlights the point already emphasized by the hokkaido group @xcite and , in the modern context , by the so paulo group @xcite .",
    "the contact terms ( those proportional to a coordinate - space @xmath68-function and its derivatives ) are spread out with increasing importance as @xmath66 becomes smaller and the ( strong interaction ) size of the nucleon grows .",
    "these groups contended that these contact terms , bringing the nucleon structure signature , should not be included in potential models .",
    "the subject of contact terms has been revived recently with the advent of effective field theories in which contact terms are used to emulate the short distance physics , and the long distance physics , including the physics of chiral symmetry , is retained explicitly .",
    "in these effective field theories ( chiral perturbation theory extended to two or more nucleons  @xcite ) contact terms abound , both in the chosen chiral lagrangian and in the nucleon potentials . adapting a field redefinition technique first used in pion condensation  @xcite , friar _",

    "@xcite were able to demonstrate , via a field theoretic calculation with an effective chiral lagrangian , why the contact term of eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) does not appear in the @xmath62-three body force of chiral perturbation theory , even though that field theory can be transformed to emulate the soft pion theorems . in sum , although chiral symmetry in the form of pcac / current algebra motivated the ansatz eq .",
    "( [ eq : funf ] ) which led to the operator structure of eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) , chiral symmetry in the form of effective field theory dictates that only the @xmath62-exchange part ( @xmath69 for tm ) should be retained in a tbf from pion exchange .",
    "one moral which can be drawn from this new insight is that chiral constraints on the off - shell scattering amplitude are not enough to determine a three - nucleon force ; one must also satisfy chiral constraints on the on - shell three - nucleon @xmath70-matrix elements which are presumed to make up the force .",
    "this observation applies to other off - shell amplitudes embedded in nuclear force models  @xcite .",
    "the removal of the spurious contact term from the tucson - melbourne force leaves a tbf with coefficients @xmath71 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 which has been termed tm@xmath72 in ref .",
    "@xcite and subsequent works . in the following section we will examine the effects in the triton of the original tm tbf and the tm@xmath72 tbf .",
    "we consider tm and tm@xmath72 with the original strength constants and with strength constants from the current @xmath4n scattering data .",
    "we employ a variational monte carlo method developed for accurate numerical calculations of light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the  urbana - type potentials \" , suited to this variational approach , take the form of a sum of operators multiplied by functions of the interparticle distance . following our previous study of charge symmetry breaking in light hypernuclei  @xcite , and in order to compare with other tbf studies  @xcite , we use the reid soft core nucleon - nucleon potential in the form of the urbana - type reid @xmath73 potential  @xcite . the reid @xmath73 is a simplified ( the sum of operators is truncated from a possible 18  @xcite to 8 operators ) @xmath74 force model which is equivalent to the original reid soft core nucleon - nucleon potential in the lower partial waves and can produce the dominant correlations in s - shell nuclei . to be specific , the reid @xmath73 is obtained from the reid soft core ( rsc ) potential in the singlet states @xmath75 and @xmath76 and the triplet states @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the binding energy of the triton , calculated with exact faddeev codes which include all partial waves @xmath79 ( 34 channels ) , is -7.59 mev for the reid @xmath73 ( as quoted in table iv of @xcite ) , to be compared with -7.35 mev obtained with the original rsc @xcite .",
    "this small discrepancy , presumably due to differences in the @xmath80-waves of the two potentials , should not affect our conclusions .",
    "the variational method we use , with monte carlo evaluations of the integrals , is described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we specify only the _ differences _ from the equations in these references .",
    "in particular , the trial nuclear wave functions have the following structure : @xmath81 { \\bf s}\\left[\\prod^{a}_{i < j}f_{ij}\\right]\\phi,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is an antisymmetric spin - isospin state , having appropriate values of total spin and isospin , with no spatial dependence , and @xmath83 is a symmetrization operator which makes 3 ! terms for the two - body correlation operator @xmath84 and one term for the three - body correlation operator @xmath85 .",
    "the nn correlation operator is @xmath86 and the triplet correlation induced by the three - body force has the usual linear form suggested by the first order perturbation theory @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath28 is a variational parameter .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite which reduce the difference between the variational upper bound and the faddeev binding energy of the triton to less than 2% .",
    "both improvements would be clearly desirable , but are beyond the scope of this preliminary investigation .",
    "we do , however , include the usual central three - body correlation @xmath88 multiplied by the correlation functions(@xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) : @xmath94\\ ] ] with @xmath95 . with these correlations",
    "we get a binding energy of -7.28(3 ) mev with the reid @xmath73 alone , a number which compares favorably with variational results in table v of ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained with a slightly different trial wave function .",
    "we now demonstrate that our variational calculations track the faddeev results of ref .",
    "@xcite and suggest that the main outline of our results ( to be presented later ) will reflect the properties of the hamiltonians chosen , provided that the potentials are not too singular .",
    "the faddeev calculations we now examine used the rsc potential and the early parameters ( labeled tm(81 ) here ) of the tucson - melbourne tbf ( @xmath96a = + 1.13 , @xmath97b = -2.58 , @xmath97c = 1.00 , and @xmath97d = -0.753 in units of the charged pion mass : 139.6 mev ) obtained from an interior dispersion relation ( idr ) analysis of phase shifts circa 1973  @xcite .",
    "ten years ago there was little reason to look suspiciously at the @xmath2-term , and the goal of the exercise was to test the perturbative nature of the @xmath10 amplitude @xmath98-wave terms .",
    "to this end , a restricted model was chosen with @xmath99 , the faddeev eigenvalues calculated for a 34-channel solution for rsc / tm , and the solution tested by employing the resulting wave functions in a raleigh - ritz variational calculation . the variational result for this restricted hamiltonian coincided with the faddeev eigenvalue , indicating the high quality of the faddeev wave function .",
    "then the @xmath0 and @xmath2 terms were selectively set to their assigned values and the variational calculation was repeated .",
    "comparison of the results shows the non - perturbative role of the @xmath0 and the @xmath2 term on the triton wave function . to test our codes and to suggest that our methods can give insight into triton binding energy effects from the proposed redefinitions of the tm force",
    ", we made a parallel set of calculations with the reid @xmath73 and the old tm force , tm(81 ) , with the parameters given above .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "we follow tradition and calculate the triton properties with the cutoff in the form factor @xmath100 . in the publications of the tucson - melbourne group @xmath101 has been recommended to match the goldberger - treiman discrepancy  @xcite , another measure of chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath102 matches the goldberger - treiman discrepancy @xmath103 of the recent determinations of the @xmath4nn coupling constant @xmath104  @xcite .",

    "( [ ccoef ] ) that @xmath2 , and therefore @xmath106 , changes with different values of @xmath66 . from eq .",
    "( [ ccoef ] ) , we see that @xmath107 , because the value of @xmath108 varies only between @xmath109 and @xmath110 as @xmath100 in eq .",
    "thus , the dependence of the value of @xmath106 with @xmath111 is slight , compared with the overall effect of the cutoff on the @xmath37 force .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in figure 1 as the open circles and open squares .",
    "the plotted points include monte carlo error bars and the lines through the symbols are drawn to guide the eye .",
    "the open circles show the calculated triton binding energy with reid @xmath73/tm@xmath72(93 ) which has no short - range  @xmath4-range term and the strength constants taken from twenty year old @xmath4n scattering data .",
    "the open squares indicate the results with the same nn potential and the updated strength constants of tm@xmath72(99 ) .",
    "each calculation was made variationally with the full hamiltonian with strength constants shown in table 2 .",
    "we indicate our calculated value of the binding energy of the triton with the reid @xmath73 alone ( @xmath112 mev ) by a horizontal ( sparse ) dotted line and the faddeev eigenvalue ( @xmath113 mev ) by the horizontal ( dense ) dotted line .",
    "our variational upper bounds are always above the corresponding faddeev eigenvalues .",
    "we compare our results with calculations in the literature with the old tbf tm(81 ) , where the lack of a prime means that the short - range  @xmath4-range term is _",
    "included_. we do not present our own variational estimates with this short - range @xmath4-range term included as they do not reflect the true situation ( see discussion of table 1 ) .",
    "the results of the combination rsc / tm(81 ) for the three cutoffs  @xcite ( already quoted in table 1 for the cutoff @xmath114 ) are given by the points with an @xmath115 .",
    "another faddeev evaluation  @xcite of the same hamiltonian ( rsc / tm(81 ) ) is shown as stars at the three values of @xmath116 and the short dashed line interpolates between the calculated values .",
    "the models tm@xmath72(93 ) and tm@xmath72(99 ) with the spurious short - range  @xmath4-range tbf removed ( open circles and open squares ) give very similar binding energies in our calculation .",
    "the updating of the strength constants seems to have very little effect on the three nucleon bound state , once the spurious term is removed .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the effect of removing the short - range  @xmath4-range force on the binding energy with the results available in figure 1 , because both the nn potential ( reid @xmath73 versus rsc ) and the tbf ( tm(81 ) and tm(93 ) ) are slightly different .",
    "however , once this spurious force is removed the two models tm@xmath72(93 ) and tm@xmath72(99 ) have a similar dependence upon @xmath66 ; those two curves are shifted vertically only slightly .",
    "it is noteworthy that the dependence upon @xmath66 is greater if the spurious short - range  @xmath4-range term is included in the tbf  @xcite ; and significantly greater for the momentum space calculations of ref .",
    "one would expect this as @xmath66 increases and the singular term ( in one nn separation ) becomes more like a delta function .",
    "it is a nice feature that removal of the spurious term makes the tucson - melbourne two - pion exchange force less sensitive to the cutoff ."
