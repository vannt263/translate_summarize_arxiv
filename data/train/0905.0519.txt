    "there are several widely known problems in the theoretical modeling of x - ray emission lines , making it difficult to use them as reliable diagnostic tools for electron density , temperature , plasma opacity , and iron abundances in x - ray astronomy .",
    "the first problem is related to the intensity ratio of the @xmath0-@xmath1 transition at 15.26   , generally referred to as 3d , to the @xmath2-@xmath3 transition , or 3c .",
    "most theoretical predictions of this ratio are smaller than astrophysical observations @xcite and laboratory measurements @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy has been used in the past to infer plasma opacity as the stronger 3c line is more susceptible to resonant scattering @xcite .",
    "however , this diagnostics depends critically on knowing the optically thin limit of the 3d/3c ratio .",
    "the second problem concerns the intensity ratio of the @xmath4-@xmath5 ( hereafter @xmath5 ) transitions , including 3f ( 16.78",
    " ) , 3 g ( 17.05   ) , and m2 ( 17.10   ) , to the @xmath4-@xmath6 ( hereafter @xmath6 ) transitions , including 3c , 3d , and a much weaker 3e ( 15.45   ) . the astrophysical observations and laboratory measurements are also significantly larger than most theoretical values @xcite for this ratio .",
    "finally , the theoretical predictions of the intensity ratio of the two @xmath4-@xmath5 transitions , m2 to 3 g , have also been shown to be significantly smaller than astrophysical observations of low density plasmas @xcite .",
    "the m2/3 g ratio is density sensitive , and have been used to infer electron densities in magnetic cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "however , the inability of reproducing the low density limit of this ratio in theory introduces additional uncertainties in the density determination .",
    "there have been claims that these modeling problems have been solved with large scale close - coupling calculations of the electron collisional excitation data of @xcite .",
    "the new theoretical values of certain line ratios have been shown to agree with laboratory measurements and a few astrophysical observations to within 10% .",
    "however , the cross section measurements of the 3c and 3d lines @xcite indicate that such apparent agreements are rather fortuitous .",
    "the more recent work of @xcite and @xcite revised their earlier work by including pseudo states and the @xmath7 pair excitation configuration in the target wavefunction expansion and obtained 15 - 20% reductions in the 3c cross sections compared with @xcite , while those of 3d changed little .",
    "@xcite further suggested that the theoretical radiative recombination ( rr ) cross sections into the m - shell of used for normalization in @xcite are underestimated by 25% , leading to smaller measured 3c and 3d cross sections . in this paper , we provide a thorough assessment of the accuracies of existing atomic calculations on by comparing them with a large sample of _ chandra _ observations of stellar coronae obtained with the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) spectrometer .",
    "we conclude that most of the existing predictions do not offer satisfactory explanation of the observed line ratios .",
    "the recent calculations of @xcite and @xcite provide the best agreement with the laboratory 3c and 3d cross sections .",
    "however , a detailed comparison of these data with the _ chandra _ observations can not be done , as the full results of the calculations including all levels necessary for collisional radiative modeling are not available .",
    "the major drawback of @xcite and @xcite is that it is not clear that the accounting the target correlation effects has fully converged . in these calculations",
    ", the largest improvement comes with the inclusion of @xmath7 pair excitation configuration .",
    "however , it is well know that such pair correlations are notoriously slowly convergent . in this paper , we propose a many - body perturbation correction procedure for the excitation cross section calculations , taking all singly and doubly excited correlations into account , but treating their effects on excitation cross sections approximately .",
    "we show that the results agree well with @xcite and @xcite for the 3c and 3d cross sections , and all line ratios are brought into agreement with the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "theoretical study of x - ray lines and their applications in astronomy have a long history .",
    "@xcite obtained the excitation cross sections of @xmath8 configurations using the coulomb - born approximation .",
    "@xcite developed collisional radiative models of and with dw collision strengths , and compared the resulting line intensities with solar observations .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite pointed out the importance of resonant excitation and its role in determining the temperature dependence of line ratios .",
    "@xcite presented a complete set of line intensities obtained with the dw approximation .",
    "@xcite studied the satellite transitions that blend with lines .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of relativistic term coupling effects of the collision strengths using the breit - pauli @xmath9-matrix approximation .",
    "@xcite built a flat crystal spectrometer on the electron beam ion trap ( ebit ) of the lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) , and conducted the first laboratory measurement of x - ray line emission .",
    "@xcite carried out a systematic investigation of the lines with the same spectrometer and ebit facility , and showed that most previous theories significantly underestimate the 3d/3c ratio .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath5/@xmath6 ratio is also underestimated in theory by large factors as compared with both ebit and tokamak measurements .",
    "independent laboratory measurements by @xcite with the national institute of technology and standards ( nist ) ebit obtained 3d/3c ratios that are consistent with those from the llnl ebit , but reported @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios very different from those measured at the llnl ebit and concluded that the @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios are consistent with modern theoretical calculations .",
    "these laboratory work prompted new theoretical studies to resolve these discrepancies .",
    "@xcite improved the earlier work of @xcite by including more configurations and computing collision strengths in a wider energy range .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of resonant excitation , recombination of and inner - shell ionization of as line formation processes using the hebrew university lawrence livermore atomic code ( hullac ) , and concluded that such a multi - ion approach increases the @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios , bringing them in better agreements with laboratory measurements and astrophysical observations .",
    "@xcite reached similar conclusions and also showed that recombination processes are important for other iron ions .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite carried out a large scale breit - pauli @xmath9-matrix calculation for electron collisional excitation of , and claimed that their results resolve the discrepancies between theories , laboratory measurements , and astrophysical observations . an independent close - coupling calculation with",
    "the dirac atomic @xmath9-matrix code @xcite confirms some of the findings in @xcite , but found remaining discrepancies between theories and measurements .",
    "most recently , @xcite and @xcite revised their earlier work by including pseudo states and the @xmath7 pair excitation configuration in the target wavefunciton expansion , and obtained significantly lower 3c cross sections than @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we concentrate on these newer theoretical work .",
    "a comparison of the line ratios from these calculations are shown in figure [ fig : tr ] , along with the predictions from the widely used astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec ) of @xcite , which is based on dw collisional data without resonances .",
    "all line ratios involved are calculated at the low electron density limit of @xmath10  @xmath11 .",
    "it is immediately clear from this comparison that the predictions from apec and @xcite are very different from those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these differences can be attributed to the lack of resonant excitation contributions in apec and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite are relatively close to each other both in the temperature dependence of the line ratios and their magnitudes , which is not surprising since the two calculations employ essentially the same physics and approximations .",
    "the relatively large difference in the 3e/3c ratio between @xcite and @xcite can be attributed to the incomplete treatment of resonant excitation in @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite are also in very good agreement , although @xcite generally produce a steeper temperature dependence of the line ratios , especially for the @xmath12 ratios .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xcite do not include recombination contributions to the line intensities .",
    "recombination preferentially enhances the @xmath5 transitions and has larger contributions at higher temperatures due to the higher fractional abundance of relative to .",
    "one surprising fact in this comparison is the relatively large differences between the 3f/3c ratios of @xcite , 3s/3d ratios of @xcite , and the corresponding ratios of @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ratios of @xcite and @xcite , which include resonant excitation , are similar to the dw values without resonant excitation .",
    "@xcite showed that the differences in the 3c and 3d cross sections in the two @xmath9-matrix calculations are small . therefore the large differences we note in this comparison are due to the differences in the @xmath5 intensities .",
    "the updated 3c and 3d cross sections of @xcite give larger 3d/3c ratios than all other calculations . because the full results of the new calculations of @xcite are not available , we scaled the 3f/3c and @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios of @xcite and @xcite to reflect the updated 3c and 3d cross sections , but keeping @xmath5 intensities unchanged .",
    "these scaled ratios for 3f/3c become close to those of @xcite and @xcite , but those for @xmath5/@xmath6 are still significantly smaller .",
    "in order to assess the accuracies of various calculations , we compare them with an extensive set of stellar coronal observations with the hetg spectrometer aboard _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory . since its launch ,",
    "_ chandra _ has observed a large sample of stellar coronal sources with the high resolution hetg spectrometer .",
    "table [ tab : src ] lists the sources in our selection .",
    "the data were retrieved from the _ chandra _ archive , and reprocessed with ciao version 3.4 and caldb version 3.4 .",
    "some sources are observed multiple times , and we combine the individual observations to improve the statistics .",
    "there are 11 sources that do not provide decent counting statistics individually , and we have also combined them to produce a single composite observation referred to as `` stack '' in table [ tab : src ] . of the 24 targets ( after grouping of multiple observations and weak sources ) in our sample",
    ", capella provides the best statistical quality because it is an calibration target , and observed many times .",
    "we follow the differential emission measure ( dem ) analysis method of @xcite to characterize the coronal property of these sources . using the apec database modified by the line emissivities of @xcite and wavelengths of @xcite , we reconstruct the dem distribution and elemental abundances of the coronal plasma by jointly fitting the @xmath131 orders of medium and high energy grating ( meg and heg ) spectra .",
    "the resulting dem and comparison of theoretical and observed spectra in the 1218   region is shown in figures [ fig : dem ] and [ fig : sp ] for the composite observation of capella .",
    "the dem is peaked near @xmath14  k , which is similar to the result of @xcite using a single observation .",
    "to characterize the temperature of the emission regions , it is more appropriate to examine the dem weighted by the emissivities , which is also shown in figure  [ fig : dem ] .",
    "it indicates that the emissivity weighted dem has a narrower profile .",
    "in fact , the characteristic temperatures of the emission regions are always in the range of @xmath15@xmath14  k for all sources , even though some of them have significant high temperature tails beyond @xmath16  k. this is due to the fact that fractional abundance peaks near @xmath15  k in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "the spectral model shown in figure  [ fig : sp ] already provides a reasonable fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "however , close inspection of the lines reveal significant discrepancies between them . using the reconstructed spectrum as a basis , we obtain a better fit to the emission by varying 3c , 3d , 3e , 3 g , 3f , and m2 line intensities . @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the 3d line blends perfectly with an satellite transition , and another nearby transition at 15.21  ",
    "can be used to remove the contribution to the 3d line .",
    "many of the sources in our sample indicate the presence of the 15.21   line , providing a measure of contamination to the 3d line .",
    "the 15.21   line intensity is extracted from the measured spectra and multiplied by a factor of 0.7 , which is then subtracted from the apparent 3d intensity .",
    "the branching ratio of 0.7 used here is determined with the flexible atomic code developed by the author , and is between the values 0.83 used by @xcite and 0.51 used by @xcite . however , because the contamination of the 3d line is relatively small , the correction decreases the measured 3d/3c ratio only by @xmath17  10% .",
    "the differences in the branching ratios leads to 23  % differences in the 3d/3c ratio , which are smaller than the statistical errors for most sources .",
    "the derived line ratios for the 24 sources are listed in table  [ tab : ratio ] .",
    "the emissivity weighted average temperature , @xmath18 , of the coronae are also shown .",
    "@xcite reported the ratios involving the 3c , 3d and 3f lines for a large sample of coronal sources observed by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. the results obtained here are generally consistent with those of @xcite for the set of common sources .    in comparing the measured and theoretical line ratios ,",
    "the calculations should ideally be performed for the appropriate dem distributions . in practice , we find that the ratios calculated with the dem is very close to the ones calculated at a single temperature of @xmath18 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : wr ] for the 8 line ratios we investigate . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we therefore use the isothermal line ratios calculated at @xmath18 for comparison .",
    "figure  [ fig : mr ] shows the comparison of measured and theoretical line ratios in detail . because the predictions of @xcite are generally similar to those of @xcite , and those of @xcite are similar to those of apec , we omit those from figure  [ fig : mr ] to reduce clutter .",
    "it is clear that none of the theories can explain all line ratios satisfactorily .",
    "all theoretical ratios are below the measured ones , except for 3d/3c , where the results of @xcite agree with the measurements , 3e/3c and 3f/3c , where the values of @xcite , @xcite , and the results of @xcite scaled for the new 3c cross sections of @xcite agree with the measurements , and m2/3 g , where the values of apec agree with the measurements .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the measured 3e/3c ratio have large statistical uncertainties",
    ". the apec ratios of m2/3c and 3g/3c are very different from the measurements , and the agreement for m2/3 g is therefore fortuitous . despite the claim of excellent agreements between their theoretical line ratios , laboratory measurements and astrophysical observations in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we find their theoretical values are significantly smaller than the _",
    "measurements for the 3f/3c and @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios , even more so than the calculations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after scaling for the new lower 3c cross sections of @xcite , the @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios are still smaller than the _",
    "chandra _ observations",
    ". since the data from @xcite and subsequent work are not publicly available , we are not able to calculate other line ratios for thermal plasmas for a more detailed comparison .",
    "the fact that the calculations of @xcite and @xcite agree with each other very well except for the differences in the recombination contributions indicates that the two theoretical methods , dw in @xcite and @xmath9-matrix in @xcite are of comparable quality for .",
    "the differences between measured and calculated line ratios are not due to deficiencies in the scattering approximations .",
    "the cross section measurements for 3c and 3d lines of @xcite demonstrated that theories tend to overestimate the 3c cross sections more than 3d .",
    "the general trend in the comparison of theories and _ chandra _ measurements indeed support this picture . if the theoretical 3c cross sections were to decrease by @xmath17  20% , the predictions of @xcite and @xcite would agree with the observations much better .",
    "3c is a dipole allowed transition , its collisional excitation cross section is nearly proportional to the oscillator strength , which is determined solely by atomic structure calculations .",
    "therefore we suspect that the root problem in the previous theories of line intensities is the incomplete treatment of electron correlation effects in the target ion .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the comparison of various oscillator strengths calculations for 3c and 3d listed in table  2 of @xcite . of these calculations ,",
    "the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) treatment of @xcite is likely to be the most accurate in describing electron correlation effects in , which also yields the smallest oscillator strength for the 3c transition .",
    "the recent calculations of @xcite and @xcite also showed that by improving the target wavefunction expansion , the 3c cross sections are reduced by 15 - 20% .",
    "however , it is not clear that the target description in @xcite and @xcite has fully converged , given that the largest change comes with the inclusion of the @xmath7 pair excited configuration , and such pair correlations are know to be notoriously slowly convergent .",
    "we have developed an independent mbpt method within the framework of fac for general open - shell ions , and have used it in calculating the wavelengths of iron and nickel l - shell x - ray transitions @xcite .",
    "we recently extended the method to also calculate radiative transition rates and oscillator strengths .",
    "the 3c and 3d weighted oscillator strengths calculated in our mbpt method are 2.17 and 0.62 , respectively . this compares to 2.50 and 0.62 calculated by the dw approximation .",
    "these independent mbpt calculations therefore suggest that the 3c cross sections are likely to be overestimated by as much as @xmath17  1020 % in previous non - mbpt calculations .",
    "@xcite gave the weighted oscillator strengths of 3c and 3d to be 2.25 and 0.635 , respectively , which agree with our mbpt results very well .",
    "this indicates the near convergence of their accounting of target correlation effects .    however , the extension of the mbpt method to treat collisional excitation processes is rather difficult beyond the plane - wave born approximation .",
    "here we propose an approximate procedure for including mbpt corrections in the calculation of dw excitation cross sections .",
    "@xcite showed that the dw collision strengths can be factorized to contain angular and radial integrals as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 denote bound orbitals making the transition , @xmath22 are angular factors , and @xmath23 are radial integrals involving partial - wave sum @xmath24^{-1 } p^k(\\kappa_0\\kappa_1;\\alpha_0\\alpha_1)p^k(\\kappa_0\\kappa_1;\\beta_0\\beta_1),\\ ] ] and @xmath25{\\ensuremath{\\left\\{{j_{\\alpha_0}\\atop j_0}{j_1\\atop j_{\\alpha_1 } } { t\\atop k}\\right\\ } } } x^t(\\alpha_0\\kappa_0;\\kappa_1\\alpha_1),\\ ] ] where @xmath26 represents a continuum orbital and @xmath27 are the usual slater integrals .",
    "the first term in @xmath28 is the direct contribution , and the second term is the exchange contribution . in the coulomb - bethe approximation ,",
    "the direct term can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the normalized spherical harmonic , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the large and small components of the dirac radial wavefunctions of orbital @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath34 depends only on the target orbitals and is proportional to the electric multipole integral of rank @xmath35 .",
    "this integral is the same as the one used in radiative transition rate calculations .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the mbpt corrected to the conventional dw direct excitation contributions is the same as the ratio of the mbpt corrected to uncorrected oscillator strenghts .",
    "we calculate such ratios from the radiative transition rates with and without mbpt effects , and use them as scaling factors to correct the direct excitation contributions to @xmath28 , and obtain the mbpt corrected collision strengths in the dw approximation .    following the procedure outlined above , and the three - ion model of @xcite",
    ", we recalculate the line ratios and compare them with the _ chandra _ observations in figure  [ fig : nr ] .",
    "the results of @xcite are shown again for easy comparison .",
    "it is obvious that our mbpt corrections bring the calculated line ratios into much better agreement with _",
    "chandra _ observations .",
    "the m2/3c and m2/3 g ratios seem to be still slightly below the observed ones , but show significant improvements over the existing theories .",
    "finally , we compare the mbpt corrected effective formation cross sections of the 3c and 3d transitions with laboratory measurements of @xcite in figure  [ fig : cross ] .",
    "our effective cross sections include contributions of resonant excitation and radiative cascades from higher levels .",
    "the cross sections of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are also shown for comparison .",
    "the @xmath9-matrix calculations include resonances , but do not taken into account radiative cascades .",
    "clearly , the mbpt corrections leave the 3d cross sections of @xcite almost unchanged , but decrease the 3c cross sections by about 18% .",
    "the cross sections of @xcite and @xcite are all higher than the present mbpt corrected values for 3c .",
    "the cross sections of @xcite are only slightly lower than the present calculations by @xmath175% , which likely represents the differences between different scattering approximations .",
    "however , the present mbpt corrected cross sections for both 3c and 3d are still about 15% higher than the laboratory measurements overall , while the 3d/3c ratios agree with each other very well .",
    "the energy dependence of the measured cross sections shown in figure  [ fig : cross ] were obtained by sweeping the electron beam energies and recording the energy dependence of the 3c and 3d line intensities .",
    "they are normalized to the rr emission into the m - shell of at a single energy point of 964  ev .",
    "there is significant statistical fluctuation in the measured data , but the overall discrepancies between the measured values and the present calculations are less than 15% , especially at the near threshold region below 1200  ev .",
    "the discrepancies between the measured values and the results of @xcite are even smaller , at 10% level .",
    "if the suggestion that the rr cross sections used in @xcite are underestimated by 25% @xcite is correct , the new theoretical cross sections of 3c and 3d of the present paper and those of @xcite and @xcite would have become smaller than the renormalized measurements .    since our new line ratios agree with _",
    "observations , the lower experimental 3c and 3d cross sections would lead to lower cross sections for all other lines as well , and to inaccurate iron abundance determinations if these lines are used as main constraints .",
    "the cross sections of @xcite were determined by normalizing the collisional excitation lines to the rr emission onto the m - shell of .",
    "the overall normalization uncertainties were estimated to be on the order of 10% .",
    "the differences between our new calculations and the measurements are therefore not significantly larger than the experimental uncertainties , especially if one takes into account that the more elaboate r - matrix scattering method seems to further lower the cross sections by @xmath175% .",
    "due to the relatively slow radiative decay of the m2 transition , the m2 line is collisionally quenched at electron densities above @xmath36  @xmath11 .",
    "the m2/3 g ratio has been used to infer electron densities in magnetic cataclysmic variables @xcite and stellar coronal sources @xcite . however ,  [ sec : hetg ] shows that the m2/3 g ratios of all coronal sources with densities known to be below @xmath37  @xmath11 are significantly larger than previous theoretical predictions , which is identified as a major problem in applying this diagnostic in @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite seem to indicate that the low density limit of m2/3 g calculated with @xcite data agree with the coronal observations .",
    "we have since confirmed that it is due to some misinterpretation of the @xcite data in calculating the m2/3 g ratio , and the @xcite ratio of m2/3 g is in fact much lower than the observations .",
    "the present mbpt corrected m2/3 g ratio , although appears to be still slightly lower overall , is at least marginally consistent with low density coronal observations .    in figure  [",
    "fig : emd ] , we show the density dependence of the emissivities of the six lines at a temperature of @xmath38  k in comparison with the predictions of @xcite",
    ". the publicly released data from @xcite do not include forbidden transition rates . in order to derive the density dependence of line emissivities , we augmented their dataset with the forbidden transition rates from the present calculations .",
    "two major differences are seen between the present work and that of @xcite , namely , the smaller 3c ( due to mbpt correction ) and larger m2 ( due to recombination contributions ) in the present calculation , which helps to explain the observed coronal values .",
    "the density dependence of m2/3 g ratios in the present calculation and those of @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : emr ] for two electron temperatures , @xmath38 and @xmath39  k. the differences between the present work and @xcite are even more pronounced at higher temperatures due to the increasing importance of recombination contributions to the m2 line intensity .",
    "we have conducted a systematic study of the emission lines of stellar coronal sources observed by the hetg spectrometer aboard _",
    "chandra_. at least some of the line ratios involving the six principal lines are shown to disagree with most existing theories .",
    "the calculations of @xcite and @xcite , which include resonant excitation and recombination contributions in dw approximation provide as good agreement with data as the more sophisticated close - coupling calculation of @xcite with the dirac atomic @xmath9-matrix code .",
    "similarly sophisticated , breit - pauli @xmath9-matrix results of @xcite , however , show worse agreements with the _ chandra _ observations for the 3f/3c and @xmath5/@xmath6 line ratios .",
    "the source of discrepancies in the two @xmath9-matrix calculations are not clear .",
    "the most recent breit - pauli @xmath9-matrix results of @xcite gave the best agreement with laboratory measurements of 3c and 3d cross sections , but a systematic comparison with _ chandra _ line ratios can not be carried out , as the full results of these calculations necessary for collisional radiative modeling are not available .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath5 line intensities of @xcite are the same as @xcite and @xcite , and only correct the ratios for the updated 3c and 3d cross sections , the resulting 3d/3c and 3f/3c ratios are in agreement with the _ chandra _ observations , but the @xmath5/@xmath6 ratios are still significantly lower than observed values .",
    "based on the mbpt calculations of oscillator strengths , we suggest that the incomplete treatment of electron correlation effects of the target is the cause of overestimating the 3c cross sections in most previous theories , as is also suggested by the recent calculations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we propose a simple , mbpt based procedure to incorporate such correlation effects in the calculation of electron collisional excitation cross sections under dw approximation .",
    "the resulting line ratios are shown to agree with _",
    "observations much better than previous predictions .",
    "the 3c and 3d cross sections of the present work are only @xmath175% larger than the calculations of @xcite .",
    "comparison of our mbpt corrected 3c and 3d cross sections and the measurements of @xcite suggests remaining discrepancies on the order of 15% , although systematic uncertainties of about 10% may explain part of this difference , and the simplied scattering approximation used here may be responsible for the remaining discrepancies .",
    "we have shown that if the rr cross sections used for normalization in @xcite are underestimated by 25% , as suggested by @xcite , the new theoretical cross sections of the present work and those of @xcite and @xcite would have become smaller than the renormalized measurements .",
    "we have presented the density dependence of the emissivities and m2/3 g ratio , and compared them with previous calculations .",
