    "the non - self - averaging parameter , usually noted @xmath11 or @xmath12 , represents the normalized inter - sample variability for systems such as diluted ferromagnets or spin glasses where the microscopic structures of the interactions within individual samples are not identical .",
    "the parameter is defined for ferromagnets as the inter - sample variance of the susceptibility normalized by the mean susceptibility squared @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the standard deviation of the equilibrium sample - by - sample distribution of the susceptibility .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the thermal mean for a single sample and by @xmath16 the sample mean . in isgs",
    "the spin glass susceptibility replaces @xmath17 .",
    "the non - self - averaging definition can be widened to other observables @xcite ; we will also discuss the behavior of non - self - averging of higher moments @xmath18 and @xmath19 of of the spin - spin correlation @xmath20 .",
    "aharony and harris @xcite gave a fundamental renormalization group discussion of non - self - averaging in diluted ferromagnets , which can be applied also to spin glass models .",
    "first , they showed that in the paramagnetic regime , at temperatures above the critical temperature , @xmath12 ( which they referred to as @xmath21 ) behaves as @xmath22 where @xmath4 is the dimension of the system .",
    "this rule can be understood on a simple physical picture : the inter - sample variability depends on the ratio of the sample volume to the correlated volume .",
    "roughly , each sample is contained in a `` box '' of volume @xmath23 .",
    "when this box volume is much larger than the correlated volume @xmath24 , all samples will have essentially identical properties ; when the inverse is true , each sample has its own individual properties .    then at the critical point @xmath25 where @xmath26 diverges in the thermodynamic limit thl ,",
    "@xmath27 becomes independent of @xmath5 even when @xmath5 tends to infinity @xcite . in this strongly non - self - averaging regime",
    "the observables for each individual sample have different properties .",
    "the passage as a function of temperature in the thermodynamic limit from `` all samples identical '' ( randomness irrelevant ) to `` all samples different '' ( randomness relevant ) is a fundamental signature of the physical meaning of ordering in systems with disorder or in spin - glass - like systems .",
    "aharony and harris show that the value of @xmath27 in the limit of large @xmath5 should be universal , for ferromagnets with different forms of disorder in a given dimension .",
    "we find empirically that within the isg family this critical parameter is dimension - independent , i.e. hyperuniversal .",
    "we report non - self - averaging measurements in near neighbor interaction ising spin glasses ( isgs ) having dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with bimodal or gaussian near neighbor interaction distributions .",
    "there is considerable regularity in behavior throughout all this range of @xmath4 , which includes the special cases @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 which is above the upper critical dimension @xmath31 . in the paramagnetic regime @xmath32^d$ ] with @xmath33 for all @xmath4 studied , to within the statistical accuracy .",
    "secondly , the peak in @xmath0 as a function of @xmath34 for fixed @xmath5 has a value @xmath35 for each @xmath5 which , after weak small size effects , is independent of @xmath5 and also of @xmath4 to within the statistics , @xmath36 .",
    "the location of the peak @xmath37 approaches @xmath25 from the paramagnetic regime ( higher @xmath34 ) for @xmath38 and from the ordered regime ( lower @xmath34 ) for @xmath39 .",
    "the same rules are followed for the higher moments of the spin - spin correlations .",
    "the standard isg hamiltonian is @xmath40 with the near neighbor symmetric distributions normalized to @xmath41 .",
    "the normalized inverse temperature is @xmath42 .",
    "the ising spins live on simple hyper - cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the spin overlap parameter is defined as usual by @xmath43 where the sum is taken over all spins and a , b indicate two copies of the same system . the spin glass susceptibility is then defined as usual @xmath44 .    the equilibration techniques ( which are different in dimension @xmath45 ) are described in refs .  @xcite . on a technical level , it turns out that the values of @xmath12 and particularly the peak value can fluctuate slightly in an irregular manner as at each size they depend sensitively on strict equilibration having been achieved .",
    "this can be used as a convenient empirical test for equilibration .",
    "it is well established that short range isgs in dimension 2 only order at @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the gaussian isg has a non - degenerate ground state and a continuous energy level distribution .",
    "the bimodal isg has an effectively continuous energy level regime down to an @xmath5 dependent cross - over temperature @xmath47 below which the thermodynamics are dominated by the massively degenerate ground state @xcite .",
    "this is a finite size regime ; in the thermodynamic limit regime the bimodal isg can be considered to have an effectively continuous energy level distribution similar to that of the gaussian isg .",
    "measurements on two bimodal models and the gaussian model isg in dimension 2 @xcite show a clear scaling of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath48 , with all the maxima in @xmath0 close to @xmath49 .",

    "@xmath182 would be weaker than the @xmath179 ; if a @xmath182 peak exists , it would be located at a temperature below or possibly at the thl @xmath179 peak .    on the second ( chiral - driven order ) scenario",
    ", it would be the chiral @xmath182 which would show a peak first , with a peak location tending towards the ( upper ) chiral ordering temperature @xmath183 as @xmath5 increases . in the paramagnetic regime",
    "one would expect a regular behavior of the chiral non - self - ordering @xmath182 with increasing @xmath5 , governed by @xmath184 . on this scenario the spin @xmath179",
    "would then show a peak location somewhere below the chiral @xmath182 peak , with a location tending towards an ordering temperature @xmath180 below @xmath183 , together with a paramagnetic regime @xmath179 behavior behaving irregularly at least at small @xmath5 because the paramagnetic spin ordering is perturbed by the dominant onset of chiral order .",
    "very informative non - self - averaging data have been published on the @xmath10d hsg with bimodal interactions @xcite , on the @xmath10d hsg with gaussian interactions @xcite , and on the @xmath10d gaussian xysg @xcite . in each case",
    "the pattern is the same :    - there is a strong @xmath182 peak at an almost @xmath5-independent temperature @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 respectively , so in each case close to the @xmath183 value estimated independently from other criteria @xcite . in the paramagnetic regime",
    "there is a regular narrowing in temperature of the @xmath182 peak with increasing @xmath5 which appears compatible with the aharony - harris law @xmath188 though the data are not presented in this form .",
    "- in each case , the spin @xmath179 peak is either not visible ( hsgs ) or is marginal ( xysg ) down to the lowest temperature at which non - self - averaging measurements were made , @xmath186,@xmath189 to @xmath190 depending on @xmath5 , and @xmath191 to @xmath192 depending on @xmath5 in the three cases .",
    "over the whole temperature range @xmath179 is always weaker than @xmath182 , and @xmath179 has irregular behavior as a function of @xmath5 in the paramagnetic temperature regime at and above the @xmath182 peak .    thus the non - self - averaging data @xmath182 and @xmath179 in the three models @xcite can be seen by inspection to be clearly incompatible with the behavior expected on the spin - driven ordering scenarios @xcite , and fully compatible with the chiral - driven ordering interpretation@xcite .",
    "the non - self - averaging data on isgs in all dimensions show a remarkable regularity . in each dimension",
    "there is a peak as a function of temperature in the standard non - self - averaging parameter @xmath0 and in the higher order parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 whose values are @xmath5-independent after weak small size effects ; the peak values @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 are independent of dimension to within the statistics for dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the paramagnetic regime above the peak the aharony - harris renormalization group law @xcite @xmath196 is obeyed , with @xmath197 for all dimensions .",
    "both of these empirical observations can be classed as hyperuniversal behavior",
    ".    published @xcite and unpublished @xcite data on the gauge glass , a vector spin glass which does not support chirality , suggest that non - self - averaging rules analogous to those that hold in the isgs appear to apply but with a different characteristic peak height @xmath198 .",
    "xy and heisenberg spin glasses can support chiral ordering as well as spin ordering . in the light of the non - self - averaging behavior reported above for the isg models ,",
    "it is clear that the published spin and chiral non - self - averaging data @xcite in @xmath10d heisenberg and @xmath199 models are incompatible with a spin - driven ordering scenario @xcite but strongly support the alternative conclusion that the spin glass ordering in these models is chiral - driven rather than spin - driven , on the kawamura scenario @xcite .",
    "an important implication is that order in the canonical experimental heisenberg spin glasses is also chirality driven .",
