    "at studying of electrically polarized bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) the generalization of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite-@xcite and some its further generalization @xcite-@xcite have been used , see also review papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this nonlinear schrodinger equation defines the complex scalar wave function @xmath0 , which describes evolution of the particle concentration @xmath1 .",
    "when direction of polarization of each particle @xmath2 is not changing during the considering processes and all of them have same direction ( the aligned dipoles ) we can write formula for the density of polarization @xmath3 . thus , the polarization density changes due to particles movement , and consequently , at changing of concentration .",
    "the waves of polarization can easily propagate even in the ferroelectric materials as well as the spin waves in ferromagnetic materials . all the more we can expect existence of such waves in the polarized becs . to consider evolution of polarization direction along with particles movement we have developed the set of quantum hydrodynamic equations , which includes equations of the polarization evolution and the polarization current evolution along with the continuity equation and the euler equation ( the momentum balance equation ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "earlier we developed similar approach for the electric dipolar ultracold fermions @xcite .",
    "there is a field in dipolar becs studying , where evolution of dipole directions is under consideration .",
    "this is research of spinor becs , which was suggested by t. ohmi and k. machida @xcite and t. l. ho @xcite in 1998 and was recently reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "we should mention that this field is dedicated to magnetic dipole becs , but the dipole - dipole ( spin - spin ) interaction is neglected there .",
    "it was marked in ref .",
    "@xcite that the full and correct form of hamiltonian of the electric dipole interaction , which also corresponds to the maxwell equations , is @xmath4 justification of this formula in accordance with classical electrodynamics @xcite is presented in the appendix a.    using well - known identity ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) @xmath5 we can see that the hamiltonian ( [ di bec tran ham dd int ] ) differs from usually used one @xmath6 moreover , the hamiltonian ( [ di bec tran ham dd int ] ) is the original form of the potential energy of electric dipole interaction .",
    "necessity to consider the hamiltonian of electric dipole interaction in the form ( [ di bec tran ham dd int ] ) caused by the fact that it must accord to the maxwell equations .",
    "this connection exists since maxwell equations describe the electric field and its connection with the sources . in our case source of the field",
    "is the density of electric polarization .",
    "action of the electric field on the density of polarization comes in to equations of motion via the force field . as the result",
    "it describes interaction of the polarization ( the electric dipole moments ) .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite that using of the non - linear schrodinger equation , which generalized the gp equation for the electrically polarized becs , and using of the formula ( [ di bec tran pot of dd int usual ] ) for description of the dipole - dipole interaction lead to the appearance of the contribution of the equilibrium polarization in the dispersion dependence of the bogoliubov mode .",
    "this contribution leads to the anisotropy of the dispersion dependence .",
    "the anisotropy of the sound velocity in dipolar bose gases has recently been confirmed experimentally ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite we considered the evolution of electric dipole directions and got dispersion dependencies for two waves .",
    "that means what account of polarization evolution leads to appearing of new wave in the becs .",
    "this is a polarization wave , which is an analog of spin waves in systems of spinning particles .    at the first step of studying of the polarization direction evolution we considered propagation of waves parallel to direction of electric field ,",
    "so their dispersion reveals no angle dependence @xcite , @xcite . as an intermediate step in studying of the polarization evolution in becs we considered fully polarized becs .",
    "usual theory of fully polarized becs is based on formula ( [ di bec tran pot of dd int usual ] ) ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it has the following consequences .",
    "dipolar part of @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath8 , so it can change sign , where @xmath9 is the angle between the direction of wave propagation @xmath10 and the direction of external field .",
    "if the polarization part is negative at positive and small enough short - range part of the spectrum , one finds the roton instability @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our consideration of fully polarized electric dipolar becs is based on formula ( [ di bec tran ham dd int ] ) .",
    "consequently the dipolar part of @xmath7 is proportional @xmath11 .",
    "so it is positive for all angles @xmath9 and shows no instability of three dimensional becs with the repulsive short range interaction @xcite .",
    "moreover full electric dipole interaction ( [ di bec tran ham dd int ] ) leads to stabilization of the bogoliubov spectrum with attractive short range interaction @xcite , since positive dipolar part can exceed negative contribution of the short range interaction .",
    "we obtained that consideration of the full hamiltonian ( [ di bec tran ham dd int ] ) is essential for fully polarized electric becs , the full hamiltonian of spin - spin interaction was considered for the fully polarized magnetic becs as well . in both cases",
    "we have one wave solution only , as it was presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . however the dipolar part of dispersion dependence changes due to account of the delta - function part of the full potential . as a result",
    "we find that the dipolar part in the electric dipolar becs becomes positive for all angles ( all directions of wave propagation ) .",
    "we have different picture for the magnetic dipolar becs , where we have another coefficient in front of the delta - function ( see formula ( 83.9 ) in ref .",
    "consequently the dipolar part of spectrum is also different .",
    "it is negative for all angles .",
    "hence , there is no roton instability for the electrically polarized becs , but the roton instability exists in the magnetically polarized becs at all angles for small enough constant of the short - range interaction .",
    "consideration of the full electric dipolar bec theory including the dipoles direction evolution was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we applied our model to calculation of dispersion of waves propagating at different angles @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite contains generalization of results obtained in ref .",
    "waves considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite were longitudinal , that means perturbations of the electric field is parallel to the direction of wave propagation @xmath12 .",
    "many features of the quantum hydrodynamics of dipolar becs and meaning of considered approximations were described in ref .",
    "@xcite as well .",
    "in this paper we suggest more general model in comparison with our recent papers .",
    "we consider full set of the maxwell equations instead of the pair quasi - electrostatic equations describing the electric field considered earlier .",
    "this approximation gives us possibility to consider electromagnetic waves along with the matter waves .",
    "below we will show that in the electrically polarized becs we have a splitting of the electromagnetic waves on two branches .",
    "so , we have four solution , two for the electromagnetic waves and two for the matter waves , the last two are waves of concentration - polarization .",
    "it is important and interestingly to admit that in this approximation we find anisotropy in the dispersion dependencies for all four waves .",

    "these equations were directly derived from the microscopic many - particle schrodinger equation by means the qhd method .",
    "method of quantum hydrodynamics was suggested in 1999 for derivation of hydrodynamic equations for quantum plasmas @xcite . in 2008 this method",

    "@xmath27 is the density of electric dipole moment ( the polarization of medium ) .",

    "using the fact that interaction is short - range we find the force field @xmath34 as a series .",
    "the force field also appears as the divergence of a second rank tensor , which is the quantum stress tensor @xmath35 .",
    "considering the first two non - zero terms in the series , existing for spherically symmetric potential of the short - range interaction for particles in the bec state , we get the gross - pitaevskii term and a non - local term containing the third spatial derivative of the square of the particle concentration @xmath36 , with @xmath37 . as a consequence",
    "we see that there is no corresponding non - linear schrodinger equation , since there is no cauchy integral of the euler equation .",
