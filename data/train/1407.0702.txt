    "the mid - infrared ( mir ) appearance of many astronomical objects is dominated by the unidentified infrared bands at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 , and 12.7  ( uirs ; c.f .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the leading candidates as carriers of the bands are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , a family of molecules which consist of tiled aromatic carbon rings surrounded by hydrogen atoms on the periphery .",
    "pahs are excited by uv radiation and then relax through vibrational emission which make up the ir bands (;",
    "variations in the relative strength of the individual pah bands have long been known , both from source to source and within individual , spatially resolved sources ( e.g. @xcite ) . the advent of space based mid - ir observatories ( e.g _ iso _ , ; and _ spitzer _ , @xcite ) has vastly increased the number of observations where variations are seen , spurring theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "it is clear now that there are many effects which can dramatically alter the band strengths of the mir spectrum of an individual pah , however the most important are ionization and molecular size @xcite .",
    "while these effects can also alter the precise shape of the bands ( their profiles ) , such variations are generally confined to circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "several studies revealed the existence of ` families ' of pah bands whose relative strengths correlate well with each other , and poorly with other bands ( e.g. @xcite ; ; see for a complete list ) .",
    "the dominant family , comprising the 6.2 , 7.7 .",
    "and 8.6  pah bands is responsible for most of the mir pah emission .",
    "it was then shown that this family is generated by ionized pah molecules ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the other dominant bands , at 3.3 and 11.2  were attributed to neutral pah emission .",
    "the ` requirement ' that a uv photon be absorbed to emit the mir pah bands leads to the majority of galactic pah emission tracing the sites of massive star formation .",
    "however , the pah emission does not emanate from the ionized h  ii  regions which are most intimately associated with the ionizing stars as the environment is too hostile .",
    "the pah molecules exist in the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) which form in the surroundings of the ionized regions where the uv field has been depleted of the highest energy photons responsible for pah destruction .",
    "this pah emission is routinely observed in both galactic ( e.g. ) and extra - galactic contexts ( e.g. ) .",
    "there is a fundamental difference between the two groups of studies though , in that the spatial scales probed are wildly different .",
    "an understanding of the link between the large unresolved star forming regions which dominate in external galaxies , especially starburst galaxies , and the less massive star formation complexes present in the galaxy is required to calibrate the properties of external galaxies .",
    "efforts to understand the connection between these regimes in terms of the pah emission have been limited so far , with @xcite being the first to consider both mass and star formation activity regimes concurrently .    to better characterize this connection",
    ", we analyze the mir appearance of the galactic star forming region w49a , focusing on the properties of the pah emission .",
    "w49a is one of the largest and most active sites of massive star formation in the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ; ; ) .",
    "w49a consists of up to a hundred massive o type stars , many still encased in their natal ultra  compact  h  ii  regions ( uc  h  ii ; ) surrounded by copious molecular cloud material ( ) .",
    "the entire complex lies at a distance of 11.4 kpc @xcite .    in order to investigate this relationship within a single object , archival _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectral maps of w49a and its associated uc  h  ii  regions are investigated in order to probe the pah band emission properties in addition to the overall mir appearance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : dra ] presents descriptions of the observations along with the data reduction , extinction and the mir decomposition . in section  [ sec : hii ] , the spectra of the various uc  h  ii  regions are presented , along with discussion of their individual characteristics .",
    "subsequently , maps of the pah emission are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : maps ] along with traditional pah correlation studies in section  [ sec : corrs ] .",
    "finally , discussion of our results in terms of the structure of uc  h  ii  regions , diffuse emission and extragalactic star formation , including the irac 8  sfr indicator , is given in section  [ sec : discuss ] , followed by a summary of our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "w49a was observed with the short - low ( sl ) module of the infrared spectrometer ( irs ; @xcite ) on - board the _ spitzer _ space telescope ( @xcite ; pid : 63 , aor : 16206848 ) .",
    "the first ( sl1 , 7.4 - 14.5 , 1.8/pixel ) and the second ( sl2 , 5.2 - 7.7 , 1.8/pixel ) order spectra of the irs - sl module were used to create a spectral map , with spectral resolutions @xmath0 between 64 and 128 .",
    "these observations cover an area of roughly 3  @xmath1 2  ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) is about 2 pixels , roughly 3.6 .",
    "the alignment of the map relative to w49a ( shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ) is centered upon the northern section of w49a and includes at least five of the uc  h  ii  sources identified by @xcite along with a section of the expanding shells , labeled as the ` arc ' region , and the northern extremities of the welch ring .",
    "the spectral mapping data were processed through the pipeline reduction software at the _ spitzer _",
    "science center ( version 18.18 ) .",
    "the bcd images were cleaned using cubism @xcite , in which any rogue or otherwise ` bad ' pixels were masked , firstly using the built in ` autogen global bad pixels ' with settings ` sigma - trim ' = 7 , ` minbad - frac ' = 0.5 and ` autogen record bad pixels ' with settings ` sigma - trim ' = 7 and ` minbad - frac ' = 0.75 and subsequently by manual inspection of each cube .",
    "bogus data at the edges of the slit were eliminated by applying a wavesamp of 0.06  0.94 .",
    "finally , the sl2 spectra were scaled to match the sl1 spectra in order to correct for the mismatches between the two order segments .",
    "the bonus order sl3 was used to determine the scaling factors , since it overlaps slightly with both sl1 and sl2 .",
    "these scaling factors typically of the order of 10% , in agreement with the typical values of 10% obtained by @xcite . in order to correct for the mis - matched pixel ( 1.8  @xmath1 1.8 ) and beam ( 3.6  diameter ) sizes , the final spectral map was created by averaging the spectra in a 2@xmath12 aperture for each point in the map and then regridding the map such that the pixel centers correspond to the centers of the 2@xmath12 apertures .",
    "this results in a map with overlapping extraction apertures such that only every second pixel in each direction is an independent measurement . throughout the rest of the work only independent pixels were used in the analysis . at the distance of w49a ( 11.4 kpc ) ,",
    "each independent 2@xmath12 pixel area in the cube represents a physical area of 0.2 pc @xmath1 0.2 pc .",
    "the integrated mir spectra for each of the various uc - h  ii  regions in the field of view is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "each of the spectra clearly show the influence of silicate absorption to various degrees . to investigate the effects of extinction on the entire irs field of view , the iterative spoon method as described by @xcite  based upon the method of @xcite  was used to measure the optical depth of the silicate feature for each pixel .",
    "the optical depths were then transformed into k band extinctions using the @xcite extinction law .",
    "the resulting map of silicate absorption is shown in terms of the k band extinction , a@xmath2 , in figure  [ fig : ext ] .",
    "the method described by @xcite extends the spoon method to compensate for extinction in the 14 - 16  region by introducing an iterative reapplication of the spoon method to the residual silicate absorption in a partially dereddened spectrum until there is no residual .",
    "the final continuum is then compared to the observed flux at 9.8  to calculate the total optical depth at 9.8  ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this figure can then be converted into a@xmath2 using a small correction factor ( a@xmath2 = 1.079 @xmath1 @xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical uncertainties associated with this technique are calculated using standard propagation of uncertainty and are quoted where appropriate ( e.g. figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "as one might expect , the numerical uncertainty is highest for the sources with the lowest flux , as the uncertainty of the flux of the 9.8  region dominates the overall uncertainty . in terms of the uncertainties of the map presented in figure  [ fig : ext ]",
    "we find that the numerical uncertainty is around 0.5 magnitudes for the highest extinction regions and 0.1  0.2 magnitudes for the lowest extinction regions .",
    "however there are also clear systematic uncertainties associated with the iterative method .",
    "the reliance upon the @xcite extinction law to deredden the spectra assumes that the @xcite extinction law is universally applicable with no variations across the map . to test this hypothesis , in figure  [ fig : spec ]",
    "we have included both the initial spoon method continuum ( orange dashed ) and the final iterative spoon method continuum extinguished using the @xcite extinction law and the final optical depth ( red dot - dash ) .",
    "the second quantity can be thought of as the appearance of the emitted power law continuum after the effects of extinction are applied . in each case , the shape of the power law continuum after the application of the @xcite extinction law matches the observed shape of the continuum , implying that the @xcite extinction law is close to that seen in w49a .    ) across w49a derived using the iterative spoon method @xcite .",
    "pink contours represent 7.7  pah fluxes ( see section  [ sec : maps ] ) red boxes indicate the extraction regions used for the different uc  h  ii  regions and the arc segments.,width=283 ]    as silicate absorption can have a large effect on the fluxes of the pah features and atomic lines , each spectrum in the map was dereddened using the @xcite extinction law , creating an extinction corrected cube .",
    "if one takes the opposing stategy , and merely corrects the fluxes in the observed cube using the average extinction for each band the differences are around 10% , while for the coadded spectra given in table  [ table : pahints ] this can rise to as much as 20 - 30% depending on how much variability there is in the extinction of the coadded pixels .",
    "this difference arises from the sometimes steep gradients in the extinction curve with respect to wavelength in the 515  region .",
    "it should be noted that the [ s  iv ] 10.5  line is heavily affected by the presence of the silicate absorption feature so our later choices of ionization proxy will be sensitive to the details of the extinction law and dereddening methods applied .",
    "example spectra from the regions of w49a which are discussed in this paper are shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the decomposition of each mir spectrum into distinct features and their subsequent measurement was performed using the so called ` spline method ' ( e.g. , peeters et al . 2014 ( in prep ) ) , which we summarize here .",
    "an example of the spline method as applied to the integrated spectrum of the arc region is shown in figure  [ fig : decomp ] .",
    "the continuum was removed from each spectrum by computing a local spline polynomial fit to the continuum ( including a point at 8.2 ) and then subtracting the spline .",
    "the area under the well known pah bands in the 510  regions was split into two distinct regions ( following , for example , ) .",
    "initially , the ` 510  plateau ' was defined by computing the area between a secondary continuum spline ( in which the 8.2  point was not included ) and the line connecting the observed fluxes at 5.5 and 10  respectively .",
    "the second component , which we name the ` 8  bump ' , was computed by integrating the difference between the primary spline and the secondary spline - tracing the area directly under the 7.7 and 8.6  pah bands .",
    "the longer wavelength plateau was measured by integrating the result of subtracting a spline continuum fitted to points at around 10  and 14  from the main continuum spectrum over the range from 10 - 14 .",
    "measurement of the pah features were performed in two distinct ways . for the strong features , at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.2 , all of the flux above the continuum associated with the feature was summed . for the weaker bands , at 6.0 , 11.0 , 12.0 , 12.7  etc , various fitting routines have been developed to reliably measure their flux . where the weaker features overlapped with stronger features ( e.g. 6.0/6.2 , 11.0/11.2 ) gaussian fits to the weaker feature were obtained and subtracted from the total integrated intensity to correct the flux of the stronger feature ( see @xcite , peeters et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "the most prominent blend , in the 1213  region , involves the 12.0  pah band , 12.3  h@xmath4 line , 12.7  pah band and 12.8  [ ne  ii ] line . the profile of the 12.7  pah feature is known to be strongly asymmetric .",
    "while the 12.7  feature is known to vary in profile from source to source , it has been found to be remarkably consistent in profile for h  ii  regions and ism material . in order to remove the 12.7  component of the blend , the average ism 12.7  band shape ( given by , measured using iso - sws ) was downsampled to the resolution of the irs - sl spectra and subtracted from the blends after being scaled to match the intensity of the emission in the 12.4 to 12.6  region .",
    "the flux in the 12.7  band was found by integrating all of the flux in the scaled 12.7 profile .",
    "subtracting the 12.7  band from the observed spectrum left the 12.3  h@xmath4 line and the 12.8  [ ne  ii ] line on a flat continuum .",
    "each line was fitted with a gaussian of fwhm set by the instrumental resolution .",
    "the systematic uncertainty associated with our decomposition of the 12.7/12.8 blend was estimated by applying the method to artificial spectra .",
    "the mean ism spectrum measured by was used as a basis for the 12.7 pah band , however it was again downsampled from the resolution of iso - sws to that of irs - sl .",
    "the [ ne  ii ] 12.8  line is constructed with a gaussian of varying peak amplitudes and width set by the irs / sl spectral resolution .",
    "this artificial blend is then downsampled to the instrumental resolution of _",
    "spitzer_/irs sl .",
    "we apply our decomposition method , which returns measurements of the integrated fluxes of the 12.7  pah band and the 12.8  [ ne  ii ] line .",
    "we can then compare our measured pah flux to the input pah flux as a function of varying [ ne  ii ] line strengths .",
    "it was found that the choice of the 12.4 to 12.6  window eliminated potential contamination from the 12.8  [ ne  ii ] line , while if the upper limit of the window was increased to 12.7 , a substantial contamination occurred of around 40% at the maximum [ ne  ii ] line strength for these observations .",
    "the other atomic lines present in the 5 - 14  range were each fitted with a gaussian with fwhm set by the instrumental resolution . aside from the 12.8  [ ne  ii ] line and the 12.3  h@xmath4 line ,",
    "the other lines ( [ ar  ii ] 6.98 , [ ar  iii ] 8.99 , h@xmath4 9.6  and [ s  iv ] 10.5 ) all appear in relative isolation or on top of an even broader feature that can be closely approximated by using a polynomial fit to the local continuum .    for the gaussian fits ,",
    "uncertainties are generated in the fitting process , while for the features for which the integration was used , uncertainties were calculated by measuring the rms noise in various wavelength windows and then combining this with each flux measurement to find the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the technique of comparing the flux to the measured rms noise was also used for the 12.7  feature uncertainty .",
    "several other more complex methodologies have been proposed and implemented for the measurement of the pah bands , each with its strengths , weaknesses and assumptions ( pahfit ; @xcite , pahtat ; and ames pah database ; @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite showed that the behavior of the pah bands was independent of the method of measurement ( while the obtained fluxes do depend on the method ) .",
    "hence , we are confident that the decomposition described here will not bias the results significantly .",
    "high angular resolution radio observations of w49a have revealed a wealth of embedded structure , with 45 continuum and water maser sources reported by @xcite . of these , several overlap with the field of view of the _ spitzer_/irs cube .",
    "the uc  h  ii  regions ( radio continuum sources ) cc , dd , ee , gg and ii lie completely within the field of view .",
    "these uc  h  ii  regions lie just to the north of the ` welch ring ' ( @xcite , labeled in figure  [ fig1 ] and later in section  [ sec : maps ] as ` wr ' ) and northwest of what is thought to be the first stars to form in w49a ( the central cluster ; ; also labeled in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the uc  h  ii  regions f , i , j and m lie close to the southern edge of the irs cube .",
    "these uc  h  ii  regions are either part of , or immediately adjacent to , the welch ring .",
    "they are much smaller and closer together than those which dominate the field of view and represent only a handful of pixels on the _",
    "spitzer_/irs maps , so they shall not be considered in detail .",
    "the uc  h  ii  regions in w49a comprise a variety of the morphological classes defined by @xcite .",
    "the uc  h  ii  regions cc and ii are listed as ` shell ' type , while ee and gg are unresolved .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spec ] , the integrated spectra of the uc  h  ii  regions are shown .",
    "each displays a typical h  ii  region spectrum , with strong [ ne  ii ] 12.8  emission , silicate absorption and a class  pah emission spectrum @xcite . weaker ionized line emission from [ ar  ii ] 6.99 ,",
    "[ ar  iii ] 8.99 and [ s  iv ] 10.5  is present in each of the spectra to varying degrees ( strongest in cc / dd , weakest in gg ) .",
    "the integrated spectra also contain a selection of weaker pah features at 5.7 , 6.0 , 11.0 , 12.0 , 13.5 and 14.2  and weak h@xmath5 emission at 9.6 and 12.3 .    in table",
    "[ table : pahints ] , the measured fluxes for the integrated spectra are shown , both in their observed form ( i.e. measurements of the spectra in the figure  [ fig : spec ] ) and after the dereddening process which will be discussed in section  [ sec : ext ] .",

    "this contrasts with the integrated irs spectrum of source ee ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) , which exhibits clear [ ne  ii ] emission .",

    "the maps are presented in their dereddened form where the extinction correction was applied as described in section  [ sec : ext ] .",
    "in general , the maps of emission features split into two distinct groups , mainly based on the appearances of cc and dd : those which peak on the shells of the h  ii  regions and those which peak towards the exciting star of the uc  h  ii  regions .",
    "while there are some deviations from this picture in specific maps , these are relatively minor and will be discussed in specific subsections .",
    "the set of maps which peak on the shells of the uc  h  ii  regions includes all of the pah bands and their underlying plateaus .",
    "the group of maps peaking at the cores of the uc  h  ii  regions contains the continua and all of the ionized lines except [ ne  ii ] 12.8 .",
    "the [ ne  ii ] line at 12.8  ( figure  [ fig : slionmaps ] ) , behaves in an intermediate way : its structure for cc and dd appears to be a fairly uniform emission across each region .",
    "the morphology of the silicate absorption shown in figure  [ fig : ext ] is interesting in that it is very different from the morphologies evident in each irac band as well as the maps of pah and atomic line emission presented elsewhere in this section .",
    "comparing the map with the spectra in figure  [ fig : spec ] we see the core region of cc possesses the weakest silicate feature and this corresponds nicely with a minimum in the map .",
    "conversely , the deepest silicate features occurred for uc  h  ii  region ii , which in the map appears to be associated with some of the highest degrees of silicate absorption .",
    "along with the smoothness of the resulting map , the consistency supports the idea that this discrepant morphology is not an artificial effect .",
    "a somewhat similar situation was encountered for iras 12063 - 6259 by @xcite , where the pattern of the silicate absorption did not match that of other mir emission components .",
    "there are several potential physical geometries which could explain this phenomenon . in both examples ( w49a and iras 12063 - 6259 )",
    "the sources are located at distances of 10 kpc or greater along sightlines passing through copious galactic plane material , implying that the strange distribution of silicate absorption could reflect the spatial layout of molecular clouds along the line of sight",
    ". however , this is unlikely to be the full explanation  upon inspection of figure  [ fig : ext ] the patches of the highest extinction are clustered around the uc h  ii  regions near the core of w49a with little strong extinction around the periphery .",
    "this argues in favour of the extinction being a composite of that along the line of sight and within w49a . the discrepant pattern of extinction",
    "might then be due to a host of processes within - anything from dust destruction around the massive stars to the collective effect of the massive star winds changing the spatial distribution .",
    "deduce that the average total foreground galactic line of sight extinction is around @xmath17 .",
    "this was derived by fitting an extinguished luminosity function to the observed color - color diagram of the w49a stars detected in a 5@xmath1 5  field , so this value should be treated as a spatial average , especially in light of the large variations we detect in a much smaller field . in a study of the ch@xmath18 emission towards w49a , it was found that the total number of hydrogen atoms along the w49a line of sight is @xmath19 @xmath7 @xmath20 .",
    "this value corresponds to an average a@xmath2 of around 2.3 , which is in good agreement with the result of .",
    "both previous studies were measuring a slightly different quantity than that found with the adapted spoon method because of their methodologies : the average foreground extinction .",
    "in contrast the spoon method measures both the foreground extinction detected by the other methods and extinction generated within w49a .",
    "for , this spatial average arises from the fitting process of one luminosity function to the color color plot , while for it arises from a lack of spatial resolution .",
    "therefore , the range of @xmath21 derived using the iterative spoon method agrees with the quoted figures even though there are areas of higher and lower extinction .      in figure",
    "[ fig : slmapsdr ] , maps of the dereddened strengths of the main pah emission bands are shown .",
    "overall the structures seen in the pah emission maps are very similar to the structure of the irac 8  image shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the main characteristics of the 7.7  pah emission map are as follows : strong emission tracing the shells of the cc / dd uc  h  ii  regions ; uc  h  ii  region ee appearing as a point source ; uc  h  ii  region ii displays some traces of emission around its perimeter , with a very bright shell section to the south east ; the northern section of the welch ring is very patchy and the emission does not seem to follow the distribution of uc  h  ii  regions .",
    "the arc region is very smooth and well defined , but much fainter than the uc  h  ii  regions .",
    "additionally , the shell of cc is not traced in its entirety , there is a gap at the south east section which corresponds to the gap visible in the 3.6 cm radio imagery .",
    "finally , the brightest area of emission in the map occurs to the east of the welch ring and is not associated with any detected continuum source .",
    "the 6.2  emission closely follows the morphology of the 7.7  emission , with two small exceptions in the shells of cc and dd : firstly , the south side of cc is approximately the same intensity as the north for the 6.2 band , while for 7.7 the south side is weaker ; secondly , the south west side of dd has a higher intensity than the north east side for 6.2 , while for 7.7 the two sides are of similar intensity .",
    "these two components are approximately the same brightness in the 7.7 and 8.6  maps . indeed , the 8.6  emission seems to trace the 7.7 emission very closely in the ionized regions .",
    "the discord between 6.2 and 7.7 is unexpected , as usually these bands are found to vary together @xcite .",
    "traces of this phenomenon are seen again in the correlation plots in section  [ sec : corrs ] and discussed in section  [ sec : struct ] .",
    "the 11.2  emission map appears somewhat different from the 7.7  map .",
    "the cc and dd shells appear similar to those seen at 7.7 , albeit with a deeper central minimum which for cc extends towards the south east through the gap in the shell .",
    "however , the relative brightness has changed significantly with the cc shell becoming much fainter than dd . in the 11.2  emission map ,",
    "the eastern section of uc  h  ii  region cc is actually brighter than the core / western section .    in each of the four maps mentioned thus far ,",
    "there is a seemingly continuous structure starting from the welch ring and connecting to the cc east emission via ee .    in figure",
    "[ fig : slextras ] , two of the weaker pah emission bands , at 11.0 and 12.7 , are shown .",
    "the 11.0  band map seems to follow the other pah emission maps in peaking around the perimeter of uc  h  ii  region cc , albeit at a slightly greater radius than the other bands .",
    "this result should be treated with caution though as the 11.0  band has very low s / n and some systematic problems .",
    "the map of 12.7  pah emission is more intriguing , displaying a mixture of features seen in previous maps .",
    "most striking are the cc / dd shells as both appear much brighter on one side ( as in the 69  pah feature maps ) however this is combined with the lower emission levels of the 11.2  feature map in the center of cc . in the case of cc",
    "this occurs on the north side while for dd the south is brighter .",
    "the eastern region of cc is also very bright and is more compact than seen in previous bands , with less emission extending along the structure connecting cc , ee and the welch ring .",
    "we have defined two extended broad emission features in the 510  region ( see section  [ sec : dra ] , figure  [ fig : decomp ] ) , the 510  plateau and the 8  bump .",
    "maps of the emission of these components are shown in figure  [ fig : slextras ] .",
    "both of the plateau maps share the unusual properties of having deep minimas in the center of the cc and ii shells . in the case of dd ,",
    "both trace the shell , but the 8  bump has much lower emission in the center while for the 510  plateau there is constant emission across the center . in each map",
    "the cc shell is broken and fainter than the dd shell .",
    "the ii shell is somewhat traced in both maps , but stronger in the 510  map .",
    "the 510  map shows the connection between cc east , ee and the welch ring even more clearly than the 11.2  map .",
    "additionally , the shape of the arc filaments differs between the two , with the 510  map strongly tracing the filament near uc  h  ii  region ii and this emission being weaker in the 8  bump map .",

    "[ fig : slionmaps ] , the emission from ionized lines in the w49a field of view is shown .",
    "the [ ne  ii ] 12.8  line requires the lowest ionization energy of all the lines detected ( ip = 21.56 ev ) .",
    "consequently , the [ ne  ii ] map displays a more uniform appearance in the uc  h  ii  regions cc and dd . in addition , the uc  h  ii  region ee is a bright point source and emission from ii falls below the s / n cutoff .",
    "the higher ionization potential lines ( [ s  iv ] , [ ar  iii ] ; ips = 34.83 , 27.63 ev resp . ) , show much weaker emission than [ ne  ii ] thus large sections of each map do not meet the imposed s / n @xmath22 3 cutoff . however , there are some subtle differences between the [ s  iv ] 10.5  and [ ar  iii ] 8.99  maps .",
    "the [ s  iv ] map peaks more sharply towards the central sources of the uc  h  ii  regions .",
    "the [ ar  iii ] map also shows some emission around the arc region , while [ s  iv ] has very low emission there .",
    "the [ ar  iii ] emission occurs at the inner edge of the arc regions .",
    "the line ratio of [ ne  iii ] 15.6  / [ ne  ii ] 12.8  is usually employed as a proxy for ionization .",
    "the _ spitzer_/irs spectra of w49a do not extend to 15.6  so a different tracer must be used .",
    "it has been shown that the [ s  iv ] 10.5  / [ ne  ii ] 12.8  line ratio mimics the [ ne  iii ] / [ ne  ii ] ratio under a very wide range of conditions @xcite .    even though the s / n is low which restricts the area for which there is data",
    ", it is clear that the morphology of the line ratio map differs from those discussed previously .",
    "the cc region in particular shows a very sharp transition from low ratios to much higher ratios in terms of [ s  iv ] / [ ne  ii ] on a diagonal line from south - east to north - west just to the east of the core of uc  h  ii  region cc . the [ s  iv ] / [ ne  ii ] line ratio is a factor of two weaker in the core of dd than cc , implying a much lower level of ionization relative to cc .",
    "region cc also has an odd appearance , with the lobes of pah emission to the north and south visible in the contour maps corresponding to patches of lower ionization on either side of the central peak ( e.g. at @xmath23=42 , @xmath24=61 ) .",
    "the continuum emission , shown for 5.5 , 10.2 and 14.7  in figure  [ fig : slcont ] , traces the centers of the cc and dd uc  h  ii  regions .",
    "some weaker features are also evident : there is a peak near ee and some weak emission connects cc east , ee and the welch ring tracing the ` bar ' evident in the pah emission maps .",
    "otherwise , faint emission traces the strong pah emission shown by the 7.7  contours .",
    "there is also very faint emission from the arc regions in all continuum maps .",
    "there are several extra sources evident in the continuum maps which do not show up in the pah maps , line emission maps or the radio maps ( for example , at coordinates [ 46,68 ] and [ 37,27 ] ) .",
    "these correspond to foreground stars which are evident in the glimpse / irac [ 3.6 ] observations of w49a @xcite .",
    "in general , there are remarkable similarities between all of the maps : each broadly trace the emission visible in the irac bands . the deviations which we have described are subtle details against a background of broad consistency .",
    "the main conclusions from inspection of the maps are that :    1 .   the usual inter - relationship between the strengths of the 69  pah bands subtly break down in the rims of the uc  h  ii  regions , 2 .",
    "the maps of the plateau emission follow the pah band emission , 3 .",
    "the continuum emission is strong in the centers of the uc  h  ii  regions , 4 .",
    "there is stratification of emission in the arc segments , with [ ar  ii ] tracing the inner edges , followed by continuum emission and then pah bands .      to observe the correlations between relative pah band strengths , the bands are usually divided by a third pah band .",
    "the main purpose of normalization is to remove correlations with the absolute intensity of the total pah emission and hence variations related to the pah abundance ( and distance in studies containing sources at varying distances ) .",

    "the average fraction of pah , 8  bump and 510  plateau emission compared to the continuum emission in the irac 8  filter can be obtained in the following manner .",
    "firstly , convolving the irs cube with the irac 8  filter bandpass and summing the results provides a simple measurement of the flux we would expect in an irac 8  observation of the same field .",

    "it was remarked upon that the 6.2  band and the 7.7  band , which are usually found to correlate extremely well , showed hints of deviation from the usual correlations . in section  [ sec : pahmaps ] this behavior was seen to be localized to the uc - h  ii  regions cc and dd , however it is somewhat difficult to see because of the contrast required to display the rest of the maps .",
    "hints of this deviation also appear in figure  [ fig2a ] in the correlations relating to the core region of uc - h  ii  region cc .",
    "given that the 7.7  and 8.6  bands correlate well in these environs , it seems that it is the 6.2  band which is displaying anomalous behavior .    to further investigate this effect , we first consider cuts showing the spatial profiles of the different emission components through uc - h  ii  regions cc and dd in the pah band measurements .",

    "the decoupling of the 6.2  band from those at 7.7 and 8.6  is troubling as usually these bands are found to vary together ( e.g. ) .",
    "a similar effect has only been observed in one other object , n66 the giant h  ii  region in the small magellanic cloud @xcite .",

    "a breakdown in the 6.2 / 7.7 relationship could be due to the c - h component of the 7.7  band becoming dominant over the c - c component . in that case",
    ", one would expect that the @xmath27/@xmath26 vs @xmath28/@xmath26 correlation would be strengthened as the dominant vibrational mode for 7.7 would then be the same as for 8.6 .",
    "this is indeed what is seen in both the spatial cuts ( figure  [ figcutdemo ] ) and the correlation plots , where a better correlation is found for @xmath27/@xmath26 vs @xmath28/@xmath26 than @xmath27/@xmath26 vs @xmath25/@xmath26 for cc core and dd .",
    "it is obvious that the regions of the w49a map away from the center of w49a behave differently than those associated with the ionized regions towards the center . here",
    ", we compare the emission surrounding w49a with previous studies of diffuse pah / mid - ir emission with the aim of determining whether the pah emission seen surrounding w49a is associated with w49a , or rather emission from the copious material along the line of sight .",
    "12  is much lower for the non - w49a spectra.,width=283 ]    in figure  [ figdiff ] , an example of the ` diffuse ' emission around the outskirts of w49a is shown normalized to the peak intensity .",
    "this spectrum was obtained by averaging the dereddened data points for a ten pixel square region of the w49a cube ( using pixels in the @xmath23 range 111 and @xmath24 range 1525 ; shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we have chosen to show the dereddened version as the comparison diffuse spectra are for very low extinction sightlines .",
    "the error bars shown in figure  [ figdiff ] are generated by finding the statistical variance of all of the flux values for a given wavelength , rather than by combining their quoted uncertainties .",
    "this gives a better measure of the uncertainty of the points in the periphery of w49 ; certainly , the plotted uncertainties are larger than the rms uncertainties . the resulting uncertainties are therefore reasonably large so as to better reflect the variability of the large area coadded , and amount to roughly 15% at each wavelength point .",
    "previous studies , for example , have focused exclusively on the properties of the diffuse emission .",
    "comparison with the w49a ` diffuse ' spectrum shows that the w49a spectrum matches that observed for the ophiuchus molecular cloud with isocam reasonably well , especially in the 512  regime .",
    "the agreement is weaker at longer wavelengths where the continuum is weaker relative to the w49a spectrum .",
    "the shape of the 12.7  feature is also slightly different between the w49a spectrum and the ophiuchus spectrum . in particular , the w49a spectrum is more sharply peaked at around 12.7  compared to the oph .",
    "spectra which is more rounded , however this could be due to the reduced resolution of the isocam instrument used to observe the ophiuchus spectrum .",
    "the 12.7  feature profile found in w49a is more similar to the average pah spectrum given by .",
    "it should be noted that there appears to be very little contamination from the 12.8  [ ne  ii ] line in the w49a ` diffuse ' spectrum .",
    "the @xcite spectrum of diffuse galactic emission obtained using the mirs instrument @xcite on board the irts @xcite also differs in its 6.2  emission as it has less than a quarter of the strength .",
    "the discrepancy with the shape of the 12.7  feature and the higher continuum at @xmath41  suggests the possibility that the emission from the outskirts of w49a is not truly diffuse emission , but rather the emission associated with the molecular cloud material remaining around the edges of w49a which is being slightly illuminated by the escaping uv photons from the inner regions .",
    "a rough estimate of the emission from the vicinity of w49a can be gained by calculating the expected emission along the line of sight and subtracting it from that observed .",
    "we use the diffuse spectrum given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  5.13 ) as a reasonable proxy for the line of sight emission .",
    "this spectrum was scaled to the column density along the line of sight to w49a , which was measured by and found to be @xmath42 = @xmath43 cm@xmath11 to within a factor of around two . comparing the scaled diffuse spectrum to the w49a spectrum ,",
    "it is clear that there is a significant contribution from line of sight emission .",
    "for example , the peak strength of the 6.2  feature in the w49a ` diffuse ' spectrum is @xmath15 8 @xmath1 10@xmath45 w m@xmath11 sr@xmath12 , while the scaled diffuse spectrum yields @xmath15 9 @xmath1 10@xmath45 w m@xmath11 sr@xmath12 .",
    "this then suggests that the majority of the diffuse emission is emitted along the line of sight , rather than near w49a . in summary , although there is a large uncertainty of around 50% associated with the measurement of the column density which was used to calculate the expected line of sight pah emission , it seems very likely that the emission in the outskirts of w49a is dominated by line of sight emission .",
    "in this paper , we have created and analyzed a large _ spitzer_/irs - sl spectral cube containing observations of the galactic star forming region w49a . using the spline method , the mir emission from each pixel of the w49a cube",
    "was decomposed into its basic components ( continuum , emission lines , pah features ) .",
    "this data was then investigated from a number of perspectives .",
    "initially , maps and correlation plots were created , suggesting a disruption of the usual pah band correlations .",
    "subsequent investigations then probed these behaviors in terms of the structure of the uc  h  ii  regions contained within w49a and found that the disruptions are highly localized to the shells of two such regions .",
    "the nature of the emission surrounding w49a was also investigated , along with the use of w49a as a proxy for starburst galaxies .",
    "the main conclusions drawn from these analyses are as follows :    1 .",
    "the mir spectra of w49a are obscured by a large amount of extinguishing material , both internal and along the line of sight .",
    "our extinction measurements are consistent with the line of sight extinction being around 2 magnitudes in the k band , while internal extinction can account for as much as 3 additional magnitudes of k band extinction .",
    "2 .   in general",
    ", the pah correlations recovered for w49a match those found for other objects , however some uc  h  ii  regions within w49a possess much higher quality correlations than others , perhaps due to uncertainties in the extinction corrections .",
    "3 .   the 6.2  pah band appears to be disconnected from the 7.7 and 8.6  pah bands in the two most prominent uc  h  ii  regions in w49a  a phenomena which has previously only been detected in an smc giant star forming region .",
    "this phenomenon is visible both in the maps of pah emission and the correlation plots .",
    "the mir spectra of w49a appears reminiscent of a starburst galaxy only if the entirety of w49a is considered .",
    "including a larger fraction of pdr / diffuse material in the beam changes the average spectrum from that of an h  ii  region to that of a starburst .",
    "the integrated properties of the field of view studied suggest that w49a exists in a regime between normal h  ii  regions and starburst galaxies .",
    "the regions of ` diffuse ' material surrounding w49a are likely to be line of sight emission from large scale galactic structure and not associated with w49a .",
    "the spectra of this material closely matches that of regions on the periphery of other molecular clouds / star forming regions .",
    "the fraction of aromatic emission in the irac 8  filter for star forming regions depends on whether the source is resolved . in the total w49a spectrum ( coadding every pixel ) ,",
    "the average fraction of pah emission from bands and plateaus in the irac 8  filter is around @xmath31  90%  similar to prior findings .",
    "however for smaller apertures different values can be obtained , for example a small aperture centered on the uc  h  ii  region cc provides a much lower fraction of around 55% because the beam is dominated by the ionized region .",
    "+    one of the main results of this study , that the 6.2  pah band decouples from those at 7.7 and 8.6  in some circumstances , has only been observed in one object prior to this work .",
    "it is important to note that for the w49a map , this effect is only obvious when very small regions are investigated in detail  inspection of the correlation plots for the whole map does not lead to this result .",
    "the small numbers of detected sources showing this decoupling then likely reflect the very small numbers of sources that have been investigated with this spatial detail . of existing and past facilities , only the _ spitzer_/irs spectral mapping mode is likely to be able to discern this kind of effect and the difficulties of reduction and interpretation of a spectral cube with thousands of independent pixels",
    "have hampered such studies .",
