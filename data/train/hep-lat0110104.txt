    "charmonium spectroscopy on the lattice is not at all straightforward .",
    "charm is too heavy for most current simulations  typically @xmath3  but too light to blindly rely on the heavy quark approximation  for @xmath4 , @xmath5 . a good probe of relativistic effects",
    "is the hyperfine splitting between the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 states , which for charmonium is @xmath8 mev .",
    "lattice quenched calculations underestimate @xmath9 by about @xmath10 @xcite , the prediction from nrqcd being @xmath11 mev @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy could be due to the quenched approximation .",
    "however , first estimates including dynamical quarks seem to indicate that they account for only @xmath12 of the difference @xcite . here",
    "we compute @xmath9 on fine lattices within the relativistic formalism , aiming for the extraction of a controlled quenched continuum limit .",
    "two approximations will be made : @xmath13 quenched , @xmath14 ozi , meaning that zweig - rule forbidden diagrams , although contributing to singlet mesons like charmonium , will not be included .",
    "configurations are generated with the standard wilson action on a @xmath15 lattice at @xmath0 and 6.6 .",
    "quark propagators are computed using wilson , tree - level clover and tadpole improved clover dirac operators ( at @xmath16 , @xmath17 while the non - perturbative @xmath18 @xcite ) .",
    "we have 60 configurations at each @xmath19 value .        for a pseudoscalar mass tuned close to the physical @xmath1 mass ( the scale set by @xmath20 from @xcite ) . even on this fine lattice ,",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath9 to the dirac operator is large , tadpole improvement giving the best estimate .",
    "the total set of results for the pseudoscalar mass and the hyperfine splitting is presented in table [ table1 ] .          within the naive non - relativistic approximation it is easy to understand the origin of the hyperfine splitting .",
    "this approximation amounts to solving the schrdinger equation in a non - relativistic potential and dealing with relativistic corrections in perturbation theory . to zeroth order @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "states are degenerate .",
    "the first order correction to the mass is the average of the spin - spin interaction giving @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the value of the non - relativistic wave function at the origin .",
    "perturbative corrections to the wave function also depend on the spin ; to lowest order , @xmath24 increases ( decreases ) for the pseudoscalar ( vector ) .",
    "we have extracted gauge invariant wave functions from lattice 4-point functions : @xmath25 . a comparison between pseudoscalar and vector wave functions is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.wavef ] .",
    "the observed pattern corroborates qualitatively the predictions of the heavy - quark model .",
    "we also exhibit the difference between the wave functions extracted from wilson , clover and tadpole improved clover dirac operators . as already observed for the hyperfine splitting , relativistic effects ( implying degeneracy breaking between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) increase as we improve the fermionic action .",
    "table [ table.all ] compiles data from @xcite .",
    "we compare with an interval covering our wilson and clover continuum extrapolations .",
    "using in all cases @xmath20 to fix the scale , our relativistic extrapolation gets much closer to the experimental value . note",
    "that this is also the case for our @xmath26 tadpole improved clover data , which gives @xmath27 mev .",
    "we conclude that a careful and controlled quenched continuum extrapolation is now feasible , and gets closer to the experimental value than previous determinations .",
    "dynamical quark effects , which presumably account for the bulk of the remaining disagreement with experiment , appear to be o(10 - 20)@xmath28 , which is consistent with the change in the coupling constant @xmath29 entering in the non - relativistic expression .",
    "ozi suppressed contributions are expected to be small for these heavy quark masses , but we can not rule out the possibility that they give a non negligible contribution to @xmath9 , which could be enhanced if there is mixing with glueballs .",
    "work is in progress to improve the extrapolations and to extract masses for other channels .",
