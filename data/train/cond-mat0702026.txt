    "@xcite improvements in resolution now offer the possibility of a direct comparison of arpes , raman , and rixs spectra in the several ev range with the hope of understanding the nature of strong correlations in the cuprates , and high temperature superconductivity , by studying electronic excitations at several energy scales .    as a fundamental building block of low - energy effective theories of the cuprates , the zhang - rice singlet ( zrs )",
    "@xcite is the starting point of the single - band hubbard and t - j models widely believed to capture the low energy physics of strongly correlated systems .",
    "it is well - known that the zrs features prominently in rixs in the cuprates .",
    "a particular test of models of the cuprates lies in the difference between rixs in edge - shared versus corner - shared copper oxide systems . in materials such as la@xmath0cuo@xmath4 and other corner sharing 2d members of the high t@xmath5 family ,",
    "the zrs is stabilized by a strong gain in antiferromagnetic exchange energy between cu and o , and can propagate to neighboring cuo@xmath4 plaquettes , with effective hopping @xmath6 ev along the cu - o bond direction , and @xmath7 ev along the diagonal.@xcite in edge - shared cuprates , such as li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 and cugeo@xmath1 , the cu - o - cu bond approximately forms a @xmath8-angle,@xcite compared to @xmath9 in corner - shared cuprates , and therefore according to goodenough - kanamori - anderson,@xcite the nearest - neighbor copper - copper exchange tends to be slightly ferromagnetic .",
    "however , higher order processes like cu - o - o - cu hopping also contribute comparable antiferromagnetic exchange terms .",
    "for these reasons , small bond - angle variations among different edge - sharing compounds can make the exchange slightly anti - ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic . in either case , the zrs is less stable and mobile due to hybridization among different oxygen orbitals not aligned with cu @xmath10 orbitals .",
    "@xcite    recent cu @xmath11 edge rixs data on edge - sharing cuprate li@xmath3cuo@xmath3 @xcite has revealed a small , non - dispersive peak at 2.1 ev , attributed to interatomic @xmath12 excitations , a strong peak at 5.4 ev , and a weak peak at 7.6 ev , both attributed to charge transfer excitations .",
    "the peak at 5.4 ev is doubly resonant for incident photon energies near 8986 and 9000 ev.@xcite in cugeo@xmath1 , clear excitations were found are 3.8 ev ( weak ) and 6 ev ( strong),@xcite and more recently 1.7 ev,@xcite which were attributed in ref . as a intra - atomic @xmath12 excitation ( 1.7 ev ) , a zrs excitation ( 3.8 ev ) , and a charge transfer excitation on a single copper oxide plaquette ( 6.4 ev ) .",
    "similar features have also appeared in oxygen 1s rixs .",
    "@xcite while a few momentum - dependent studies have been performed , the incident photon energy dependence , or resonance profile , is usually shown only for a few selected points in the brillouin zone .    in this paper",
    "we present a theory for rixs for the copper @xmath2-edge and present exact diagonalizations of hubbard clusters of edge - sharing copper oxide plaquettes shown in fig .",

    "we calculate both the rixs spectrum and the resonance profile for several cluster geometries , and determine the nature of excitations accessible via light scattering .",

    "we find good agreement with the results on edge - shared copper oxide systems , and confirm a number of previous excitation assignments .",
    "the rixs process consists in scattering an incident photon of energy @xmath13 off a sample in the ground state @xmath14 having energy @xmath15 . for @xmath11edge rixs ,",
    "an electron from the @xmath16 copper - core is photoexcited into the cu @xmath17-band , leaving behind a core hole .",
    "the strong coulomb repulsion between the core hole and @xmath10 holes on the same cu atom reorganizes charge density , forming an intermediate state @xmath18 of eigenenergy @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 electron resides in a rather extended wave - function and therefore interacts weakly with @xmath21 and core states .",
    "we neglect its interaction hence providing us with a rather simple description of rixs .",
    "the @xmath20 electrons then enter into the problem as a spectator at energy @xmath22 and the intensity will be proportional to the projected @xmath20-band density of states ( dos ) at that energy .",
    "the incident polarization determines the necessary orbital projection .",
    "the @xmath20 electron then recombines with the @xmath16 core hole emitting a photon of energy @xmath23 , leaving the system in the final state @xmath24 of eigenenergy @xmath25 and a photon energy transfer @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to a simplification of the general expression given in ref .. in this approximation the spectrum will be given by the following relation and with the @xmath13 dependence given by a convolution with the @xmath20 band dos  :    @xmath27    here @xmath28 represents the cu @xmath29 energy separation . for simplicity , in a first approach , we neglect specific @xmath20 orientation and photon polarizations .",

    "these include off - diagonal couplings between @xmath21 states which may be important for singlet - triplet energy differences as well as providing pathways for symmetry - allowed @xmath12 excitations .",

    "we use a standard set of parameters [ in ev ] @xcite : @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "these parameters give a value for the copper magnetic exchange @xmath62 ev for corner - shared copper oxides , and 2.8 mev for edge - shared .",
    "we first perform full exact - diagonalization of the hamiltonian without the core - hole , and then redo the calculation with the core - hole . since the hamiltonian conserves the total spin , we diagonalized in the s=1/2 sector . from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the two steps , the rixs spectrum for a given @xmath13",
    "is computed from eq.([rixs - formula ] ) .",
    "as our calculations involve determining the eigenvector of each state used to construct the matrix elements involved in rixs , we know the character of each excitation exactly and do not need to make a priori assumptions about which peak corresponds to which fundamental excitation .",
    "this allows us to make direct correspondance between rixs and other core - level spectroscopic techniques , without any further assumptions .",
    "this is quite different from the lanczos method , which truncates the hilbert space and focuses on the low - lying energy excitations . whereas this method allows investigation of slightly larger clusters , extensions to higher energies",
    "is problematic particularly for rixs where eigenvectors are needed to evaluate the matrix elements between higher energy states in order to obtain both the resonance profile ( dependence on incident photon energies ) as well as the intensities of prominent peaks in the spectrum . since the core - hole interaction is essentially in nature ( on - site coulomb repulsion ) , leading to only a slight delocalization of the charge , we checked that the cluster - size does not play a crucial role in the qualitative shape of the spectra . in that sense ,",
    "the calculations done in the present paper add more information and provide a more direct access to the relevant rixs excitations compared to other techniques used in previous studies in the context of standard cuprates.@xcite these studies treated the one - band hubbard model where the zhang - rice singlets are , by construction , already formed , and focused only on the momentum dependence of the mott gap excitation . by treating the problem in a multi - band model ,",
    "the formation of zhang - rice excitations comes naturally in the problem and its signature in the rixs intensity , peak dispersion and resonance profile can be directly addressed .",

    "we first plot the xps spectrum for both edge - shared cluster cu@xmath66o@xmath65 and corner - shared cluster cu@xmath66o@xmath67 in fig .",
    "( [ cluster ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "the prominent features correspond largely to 1 ) a non - locally screened d - intersite zrs @xmath68 feature at 2.2 ev , where the core hole has pushed a @xmath69 hole from the on - site cu onto the oxygen ligands in the neighboring plaquette , 2 ) a local charge transfer ( ct ) excitation @xmath70 at 3.5 ev whereby the screening of the core hole comes from the hole transfer from copper to oxygen on the same plaquette,@xcite and 3 ) a 10 ev high - energy poorly screened @xmath69 cu hole on the core - hole site .",
    "these results are quantitatively similar to those presented earlier , @xcite apart from a more realistic value of the exchange @xmath71 in the corner - shared geometry .",
    "we note that x - ray absorption spectra in an extended system can be obtained from our xps spectrum via a convolution with the copper @xmath20 dos , giving a broad absorption edge followed by spectral intensity extending higher in energy governed by the @xmath20 bandwidth .",
    "these excitations , present in both corner and edge - shared geometries , occur at roughly the same energy since they are governed by charge transfer energies and the exchange @xmath72 between copper and oxygen : the cu - cu exchange does not play a major role in setting these energy scales .",
    "the main difference concerns the prominence of the non - locally screened d - intersite zrs excitation in the corner - shared compared with the edge - shared systems . while the zrs accounts for nearly 80 percent of the ground state wavefunction including the core hole for the corner - shared plaquettes , it is approximately 56 % for the edge - shared system , reflecting the number of oyxgen hybridization pathways available in the edge - shared configuration .",
    "@xcite thus while the energy is comparable in both systems , the matrix elements are much weaker at the zrs scale in the edge - shared compared to corner - shared systems . in addition , the mobility of the zrs for each geometry determines the peak widths , reflecting the splitting between bonding and anti - bonding zrs on sites neighboring the core hole . in the case of the corner - shared systems",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath73 , while due to the orientation of the orbitals in the edge - shared systems , the splitting is @xmath74 ev . as a result , the locally screened @xmath75 peak at 3.1 ev is much larger in edge - shared compared to corner - shared .",
    "this has led the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity , occurring in corner - shared compounds and absent in edge - shared compounds , to be associated with the stability of the zrs.@xcite we note that the primary role of the oxygen orientation in the formation of the zrs is not captured in single - band hubbard model calculations .",

    "while the results differ slightly for different locations of the core hole , we note that the changes are only quantitative and give different broadening of the rixs peaks due to the different mobility of the d - intersite zhang - rice excitation on the end or middle of the cluster .",
    "however , since the aim of this paper is to compare trends for different cluster geometries and charge transfer energies , we will not discuss further these relatively minor changes in the spectra .    the rixs spectrum shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ wave1]a consists of two prominent excitations at approximately @xmath78 ev energy transfer , at incident photon energies of 3.1 and 10 ev .",

    "[ wave1]a we show a blow up of the low energy rixs spectrum . by examining the symmetries of the core - hole and final state wavefunctions , the nature of the rixs excitations , and the origin of their resonant profile , can be determined by inspection of matrix elements appearing in eq .",

    "so far , our analysis did not include the copper-@xmath20 states .",
    "however , in order to obtain results more closely connected to experiment and to include a photon polarization dependence for the cu @xmath2-edge process , the cu-@xmath20 dos must be included into the calculations . indeed , the cu-@xmath16 core - electron can only be excited into the @xmath20-levels if there is a finite dos for unoccupied states . due to crystal field effects ,",
    "the 4p dos for different @xmath96 orbitals provide a polarization dependent shift of the resonance energies and secondary satellites governed by the peaks of each @xmath20 projected dos as well as the overall bandwidth .",
    "the orientation of the incident and emitted photon polarizations determine which @xmath20 projected dos is accessed .    since the @xmath20-states are rather extended orbitals their interaction with the hubbard subbands is quite weak .",
    "however , depending on the incoming light - polarization , matrix elements are selected so that one can access different linear combinations of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 states .",
    "since the dos distributions are differents , the rixs spectra reflect these characteristics . thus to deduce the influence of the @xmath20-states , we neglect minor real - space variations of the combined cluster-@xmath20 wavefunction and compute the convolution of our raw - rixs spectrum with the calculated @xmath20 projected dos @xmath100 :    @xmath101    the projected @xmath20 dos is calculated using linearized augmented plane wave method ( lapw ) in a coordinate system consistent with experiment.@xcite in the following subsection we present results for different edge - shared cuprates li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 and cugeo@xmath83 .      for li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 , the @xmath20 projected dos is shown in fig .",

    "the result of such a convolution is given in the right panel of fig.[ge_exp ] .",
    "a full exact - diagonalization treatment of multi - band hubbard clusters has been used to calculate the polarization , incident photon energy , and transfered photon energy dependencies , of rixs in one - dimensional , edge - shared insulating cuprates . by building upon previous work ,",
    "@xcite the rixs spectrum can be constructed using xps final - states as the intermediate states of inelastic x - ray scattering .",
    "the intensity and resonance profile , as well as the identity and character of the main rixs peaks has been obtained using the eigenstates and eigenenergies of clusters with and without the core - hole .",
    "these peaks correspond to non - locally screened d - intersite zrs @xmath93 , local ct @xmath75 , and poorly screened @xmath69 , each having intensities and resonance profile determined by the overlap of these states with the intermediate core - hole states .",
    "the polarization dependent rixs spectra were obtained by convolving the raw rixs spectra with the copper @xmath20 projected dos determined by wien2k density functional calculations .",
    "while the resulting rixs spectra includes the @xmath20 states as merely spectators to the re - arrangement of copper - oxygen valence charge density , a polarization and material dependent rixs emerges due to the peak structures and intensities of the @xmath20 orbitally - projected intermediate states .    direct comparison ( see figs .  [ li_comp],[ge_exp ] ) with recent data for two edge - shared cuprates , li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 and cugeo@xmath83,@xcite shows both qualitative and , more importantly , quantitative agreements between theory and experiment for the shape , energy , width , and resonance profile of rixs spectral features .",
    "this indicates that the local cluster model can adequately reproduce the data for photon energy losses in the energy range of 2 - 7 ev .",
    "we again remark that @xmath12 excitations are not captured in the model , and further , that spin - flip excitations , which require large clusters to observe bi - magnon spin rearrangements at long wavelengths , are also very weak .",
    "better agreement of the calculated spectra with experiment may be obtained by using more refined cluster parameters , multi - pole couplings , and more accurate representation of resolution broadening .",
    "a polarization dependent rixs experimental study , for li@xmath0cuo@xmath0 , should find significant differences in the resonant profiles for in - plane polarization and polarization perpendicular to the cuo@xmath0-plane .",
    "[ liconv ] indicates that peak intensities are brighter and their resonance energies are shifted by @xmath135 ev for in - plane compared to perpendicular polarizations .",
    "these predictions as well as others , like multiple resonant features resulting from @xmath20-projected states , open a way to infer from cu @xmath11edge and other indirect rixs experiments the unoccupied dos . in this way rixs can be seen as a complementary tool to core - level spectroscopies such as xps and xas , providing at the same time diverse and important spectral information on elementary excitations in strongly correlated materials .    in summary",
    ", we have explored the cu @xmath11edge spectrum for different edge - shared copper oxide systems , and have shown that the energy scales , peak intensities , and resonance profiles can be explained qualitatively within the context of exact diagonalization studies of the multi - band hubbard model .",
    "the prospect of mapping out the full momentum , and resonance profile dependences would allow for a direct spectral check of the many roles played by local electronic correlations in the multi - band hubbard approach .",
    "this remains a topic of future research .",
