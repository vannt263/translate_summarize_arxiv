    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , with some ten thousand square degrees of simultaneous five - band imaging and extensive spectroscopic follow - up observations has revolutionised studies of optically - selected luminous quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "optical selection of quasars is highly effective at identifying large samples of quasars . between the sdss , the 2df quasar redshift survey ( 2qz , @xcite ) and the 2df - sdss lrg and qso survey",
    "( 2slaq , @xcite ) , more than 150000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars have been catalogued between redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "the 2qz and 2slaq exploit the ultraviolet ( uv ) ` excess ' shown by many quasars with respect to galactic stars , and blue quasars with @xmath11 are confirmed with reasonable efficiency ( @xmath050  per  cent ) .",
    "however , at higher redshifts , intergalactic absorption shortward of the ly@xmath12 emission line reduces the uv - excess signal .",
    "quasars suffering from even a small amount of dust extinction , whether intrinsic to the quasar or due to intervening absorption systems , show reduced uv flux at all redshifts .",
    "the sdss improves on the uv - excess selection by employing multi - colour selection , choosing as quasar candidates objects with colours that are not consistent with the stellar locus ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has been shown to be effective at including quasars experiencing small to moderate amounts of dust extinction ( @xcite ) and non - standard spectral energy distributions ( seds , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the selection suffers from significant incompleteness at redshifts @xmath13 , coincident with the peak in the space density of luminous quasars , where the sdss colours of quasars and stars are indistinguishable .",
    "more importantly , in the context of the ability to undertake a census of objects experiencing moderate amounts of dust extinction , the sdss quasar survey is flux - limited in the @xmath5-band .",
    "the use of the redder @xmath5-band represents a significant improvement on previous surveys with flux limits in the @xmath14- or @xmath15-bands .",
    "however , the significant reduction in flux , even in the observed - frame @xmath5-band , due to the presence of dust with @xmath16 0.2mag means that the majority of any such population of quasars falls below the survey flux limit , with the fractional loss increasing rapidly with redshift .",
    "quasar selection at a variety of other wavelengths is also possible , each with strengths and weaknesses .",
    "radio wavelengths are unaffected by dust obscuration , but only a small fraction ( @xmath010  per  cent ) of all quasars are radio - loud , and thus are not representative of the general quasar population .",
    "deep x - ray surveys are also less sensitive to dust obscuration , but are incapable of detecting quasars surrounded by large column densities of gas . as will be discussed in section  [ subsec : balfrac ]",
    ", the fraction of broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) , which are faint in x - rays , may be as large as 40  per  cent at certain redshifts and luminosities .",
    "the rosat bright survey @xcite covers a large fraction of the sky , but is too shallow to allow an effective census of quasar activity .",
    "the upcoming erosita @xcite mission , an all - sky imaging survey aiming to catalogue up to three million agn , is promising but spectroscopic follow - up observations will still be required to confirm the quasar identifications .",
    "space - based long - wavelength infrared ( ir ) observations cover large areas to interesting depths , but limited angular resolution and the difficulty of distinguishing objects with significant agn activity from among the much more numerous and heterogeneous starburst - dominated sources remains a challenge when attempting to compile large catalogues of objects .",
    "space - based near - infrared ( nir ) surveys , notably the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) , offer enormous promise but currently exploitation is at a very early stage .",
    "ground - basesd observations at nir wavelengths hold several advantages over those described above .",
    "first , the effects of dust obscuration are greatly diminished in the nir with respect to optical wavelengths .",
    "second , large areas of sky can be covered to magnitude depths rivalling optical surveys . finally , as will be shown in section  [ subsec : kx ]",
    ", all known types of quasars exhibit a straightforward nir excess , enabling their selection irrespective of the details of the restframe uv through optical sed .",
    "the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) , with observations in the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands , essentially covers the entire sky , but the bright magnitude limits restrict detections to either the local universe or the very brightest objects .",
    "the almost complete ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , @xcite ) aims to cover 7500 deg@xmath1 to @xmath20 , i.e. nearly three magnitudes deeper than 2mass , and forms the basis for the investigation of the quasar population described here .",
    "specifically , our goal is to undertake a survey of sufficient sky area , reaching a flux limit adequate to provide new constraints on the intrinsic frequency of quasars experiencing dust extinctions up to @xmath21 0.5mag , as well as the presence of quasars with intrinsically red uv through optical seds .",
    "the sub - types of quasars anticipated to be found in such a large - area , nir - selected survey are outlined in the following sub - sections .",
    "quasars exhibit red colours either due to an intrinsically red continuum , or , because of the presence of dust along the line of sight . in the case of dust extinction ,",
    "the observed shape of the quasar sed is altered due to the wavelength - dependent reduction of flux , with shorter wavelengths more affected .",
    "the change of sed shape , as well as the loss of flux , can both lead to quasars being excluded from existing catalogues .",
    "the dust can either be intrinsic to the quasar and host galaxy , or external to the system along the line of sight ; both cases lead to similar observational effects .",
    "the present study is sensitive to both red and dust - reddened quasars provided the spectra still show evidence of broad emission lines .",
    "the debate regarding the fraction of dust - reddened quasars currently missing from optical surveys is ongoing .",
    "previous work by @xcite , as described in section  [ subsec : kx ] , estimated the fraction of luminous dust - reddened quasars to be @xmath22 20  per  cent , although the area covered by that survey was relatively small . the fraction is larger than the 15  per  cent estimated from the sdss quasars @xcite , but significantly less than the large fractions claimed from other studies ( e.g. @xcite , for example ) .    other recent work searching for dust - reddened quasars has focused on selection of candidates at wavelengths other than the strongly affected optical .",
    "the first2mass red quasar survey @xcite selects radio - loud objects matched to 2mass , and then requires very faint optical magnitudes to be considered a red quasar candidate for follow - up optical and nir spectroscopy .",
    "the study is hampered by the bright nir magnitude limit of @xmath23 and highly uncertain @xmath24 estimates , making the estimates of the reddened fraction of 2560  per  cent also uncertain .",
    "deeper nir imaging is required to properly sample the general quasar population instead of only the very brightest subset .",
    "it is well established that balqsos show signs of intrinsic dust reddening greater than that of the general quasar population ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for example ) .",
    "thus balqsos are underrepresented in the optical quasar surveys within which they are identified .",
    "in addition to the dust reddening , balqso seds are characterised by large sections of almost completely absent flux , altering their photometric properties in a non - uniform way .",
    "attempts have been made to determine the intrinsic fraction of balqsos within the general quasar population , but these efforts are hampered by the selection effects of the underlying catalogues on which the studies are based , which affect the balqsos and nonbals differently .",
    "recently , @xcite have performed extensive analysis on the sdss dr6 quasar catalogue , investigating the selection algorithm and its effect on the determination of the intrinsic balqso fraction .",
    "the allen et al .",
    "study found the intrinsic fraction of balqsos , using the classical _ balnicity index _ , ( bi , @xcite ) , to be as high as 41@xmath255  per  cent .",
    "the study also found evidence of evolution of the balqso fraction with redshift , which would not be explained by simple orientation effects .",
    "however , this result remains somewhat uncertain due to the large completeness corrections dependent on redshift , colour and luminosity that affect the parent sdss quasar sample .    constructing the quasar sample at nir - wavelengths , less affected by both the dust intrinsic to the balqsos and the loss of flux at uv and optical wavelengths due to the absorption troughs , will greatly assist the determination of the intrinsic balqso fraction .",
    "there are many hundreds of high redshift ( @xmath26 ) quasars that have absorption signatures from large neutral gas column density ( @xmath27@xmath28 ) foreground objects imposed on their spectra .",
    "the chemical composition of these damped lyman alpha ( dla ) intervening absorption systems has been extensively studied , but their dust content remains poorly constrained .",
    "the debate regarding the fraction of dla invervening absorption systems that remain undetected due to intrinsic dust causing the background quasar to fall below the flux limit of optically selected samples is ongoing .",
    "results from a radio - selected sample of quasars indicate that optical selection underestimates the number of dlas due to dust bias by at most a factor of two @xcite .",
    "however , the radio sample is small and the constraints are not tight .    employing a sample of probable dlas selected via detection of ca`ii ` ( h & k ) absorption in sdss quasar spectra , dust reddening in the underlying quasar spectra with @xmath29 0.1 has been detected ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the distribution of @xmath24 values and the corresponding detection probabilities , the fraction of systems missed due to the dust bias is estimated to be as large as @xmath040  per  cent , but still consistent with the estimates from the radio - selected study .",
    "the ca`ii`-based absorption system investigation focussed on relatively low redshifts , whereas , at higher redshifts @xmath26 , it is clear that the observed sample of dlas shows no evidence for dust reddening @xcite . making progress towards establishing whether a significant fraction ( some tens of per cent ) of dla systems at high redshifts also show evidence for modest amounts of dust extinction requires a flux - limited quasar sample at nir wavelengths , where the bias against including such systems is greatly reduced .",
    "the current work is an extension of a previous programme described in @xcite .",
    "the goal is to exploit the @xmath2-band excess shown by all quasars , irrespective of redshift and the amount of dust - reddening , to construct a more complete quasar catalogue for redshifts @xmath30 .",
    "exploring areas of sky previously surveyed by the sdss greatly reduces the amount of new observations required .",
    "the project is unique as it represents the first large - area survey of quasar candidates selected by photometric redshift techniques with uniform spectroscopic follow - up observations to confirm the quasar identifications .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the data used for the study , section  [ sec : candselection ] details the selection of quasar candidates , section  [ sec : obs ] describes the spectroscopic observations .",
    "the kx quasar catalogue is described in section  [ sec : kxcatalogue ] , while an evaluation of the quality of the quasar selection algorithm is given in section  [ sec : photozeval ] .",
    "section  [ sec : kxproperties ] describes some of the properties of the kx - selected quasars , and a discussion of the results is given in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "for the interested reader , the completeness of the candidate list with respect to the input data and how it affects the effective area of the survey is discussed in the appendix .",
    "concordance cosmology with @xmath31 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is assumed throughout .",
    "magnitudes on the vega system are used throughout the paper , as the ukidss magnitudes are based on this system .",
    "the sdss ab - magnitudes are converted to the vega system using the relations : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , as described in @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the psf magnitudes are used for the sdss @xmath40 bands , and the aperture corrected ` apermag3 ` magnitudes are used for the wfcam @xmath41 bands .",
    "the optical data , including photometry and spectroscopy , are taken from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 , @xcite ) .",

    ", each detected object will potentially possess @xmath42 photometry plus extensive morphological information and , for a subset of targets , sdss spectroscopic observations .",

    "object redshifts are taken from the @xcite catalogue and the sample of 107194 quasars / agn is herein referred to as the enhanced sdss dr7 quasar catalogue .",
    "this section details the principles and techniques used to construct the list of quasar candidates for further spectroscopic observations .",
    "analysis of the performance of the candidate selection is presented in section  [ sec : photozeval ] , and details regarding the input catalogues that affect the completeness of the resulting candidate list are presented in appendix  [ app : catcompl ] .",
    "the principle of utilising the @xmath2-band excess of quasars with respect to galactic stars for quasar selection was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the key features of the @xmath2-band excess ( kx ) quasar selection are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gjk_sdss ] . for this figure ,",
    "spectroscopically confirmed quasars , galaxies and stars were extracted from the sdss database and matched to the ukidss las .",
    "each population was restricted to @xmath47 , and the galaxies were restricted to @xmath48 , for clarity within the plot .",
    "the quasars span the redshift interval @xmath49 .",
    "the quasars show a clear @xmath2-band excess in their @xmath50 colours with respect to stars at all redshifts and , importantly , the effect of dust reddening increases the separation , as shown by the black arrow in the figure .",
    "the overlap within the colour - space between quasars and low redshift galaxies can be resolved using morphological information when targetting quasars with redshifts @xmath51 such that host galaxies are not detected in the images .",
    "there have been a number of studies employing kx selection of quasar candidates over small ( @xmath221 deg@xmath1 ) areas ( for example , @xcite , or more recently , @xcite ) but our primary goal is to utilise the technique to examine the properties of intrinsically luminous quasars where a large survey ares is required due to their low surface density on the sky ( tens of objects per square degree ) .",
    "the first large area study employing kx selection of quasars was undertaken by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter  the pilot kx survey  ) , which covered @xmath5213  square degrees .",
    "aside from a @xmath2-band magnitude restriction , the only criterion required for selection as a kx candidate was a position on the @xmath53 plane rightward of a selection line similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gjk_sdss ] .",
    "in addition to recovering known sdss quasars , a number of quasars not selected by the sdss algorithm were observed .",
    "these objects included low - redshift quasars with substantial contamination from their host galaxies , high - redshift balqsos , and quasars at @xmath13 , where the sdss selection algorithm is highly incomplete .",
    "the aim of the current study is to build on the information gained from the pilot kx survey to further improve the candidate selection and increase the area covered by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath54 ) algorithms aim to determine the identification and redshift of an object based primarily on broad band photometry , without the use of time consuming spectroscopy .",
    "much effort has been focused on photo-@xmath54 development in recent years due to the large area , deep , multi - wavelength imaging surveys that have become available or are in the final planning stages",
    ". the large number of objects and their faint magnitudes make follow - up spectroscopy unrealistic , leaving photo-@xmath54 as the only viable alternative for object classification and redshift determination .    in their simplest form ,",
    "photo-@xmath54 algorithms attempt to determine both the identification and redshift of an input object by comparing the observed photometry to synthetic photometry from a set of either model or template seds .",
    "the identification and redshift are found by determining the best match between the observed and synthetic photometry .",
    "although photo-@xmath54 is conceptually straightforward , achieving accurate , precise and reliable results is difficult .",
    "several different photo-@xmath54 algorithms are freely available , with varying levels of complexity , such as _ hyperz _ , @xcite , and eazy , @xcite .",
    "most concentrate on identifying galaxies , exploiting in particular the distinctive 4000 - break spectral feature characteristic of old stellar populations .",
    "there are studies focusing on photo-@xmath54 for quasars ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) but the results are generally not as good as those for galaxies due to the lack of strong spectral features in the power - law quasar spectrum over large ranges of redshift . at @xmath55 ,",
    "the quasar host galaxy can also complicate photo-@xmath54 identification by contributing significant galaxy - flux to the quasar sed .",
    "the photo-@xmath54 algorithm used to select candidates for the present study ( hereinafter referred to as the nir photo-@xmath54 ) was custom - made for this project and is relatively simple when compared to the more complex photo-@xmath54 algorithms recently released .",
    "within the nir photo-@xmath54 , the ` identification ' and ` redshift ' are determined using straightforward @xmath56 minimisation between the observed photometry and synthetic photometry derived from model and template seds and the @xmath42 passbands . however , the nir photo-@xmath54 holds two advantages over previous quasar photo-@xmath54 efforts .",
    "the first is the use of optical ",
    "nir photometry afforded by the overlapping areas of sdss and ukidss . as described in section  [ subsec : kx ] , the combination of optical and nir colours allows the effective discrimination between stars and quasars at all redshifts due to the excess of @xmath2-band flux shown by quasars .",
    "the second advantage is the high - quality quasar models employed .",
    "eleven model quasars , with a variety of sed properties were used within the nir photo-@xmath54 .",
    "the base - model is the unreddened , ` standard ' model , quasar described in section  2.4 of @xcite .",
    "seven reddened models were created , taking the base - model , reddened with increasing amounts of smc - type dust covering the interval .",
    "in addition , models with emission line strength twice that of the standard model , combined with both the standard and a redder continuum slope ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , for @xmath59 ) , as well as a particularly blue model ( @xmath60 ) with no emission lines were incorporated into the nir photo-@xmath54 .",
    "experiments were conducted to ascertain whether a larger range of quasar sed properties improved the performance of the redshift determinations but no significant gain was found from the addition of further models .    to identify morphologically compact galaxies and remove them from further consideration , seven galaxy templates , spanning e through scd types , were used .",
    "the e through sc templates are from @xcite , while the sbc and scd galaxy values are from @xcite .",
    "the quasar models and galaxy templates were employed to generate synthetic colours for redshift increments of @xmath61 , over the intervals @xmath62 for quasars and @xmath63 for galaxies , although due to the relatively bright magnitude limits , galaxy templates at redshifts of @xmath64 were never found to be chosen as the best solution for any objects .",
    "star templates , from the bruzual - persson - gunn - stryker atlas , were also incorporated .",
    "the atlas is unpublished , but can be found at http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/cdbs/bpgs.html .",
    "the following steps are involved in creating the final quasar candidate list from the initial optical and nir photometry data .",
    "first , objects with stellar morphological classification as determined by the ukidss data reduction pipeline , and have detections in all four @xmath41 passbands covering the area in the sky shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coverage ] are selected from the las dr4 database via the wfcam science archive ( wsa , @xcite ) sql query interface .",
    "the resulting data from this query are crossmatched to the sdss dr7 database ( ` photoobjall ` , ` specobjall ` and ` photoz ` tables ) .",
    "only the nearest neighbour within a pairing radius of 1@xmath65 was retained , as the astrometric consistency between the sdss and ukidss is better than @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the crossmatched ukidss las and sdss data produced a list of objects that possess @xmath42 magnitudes , morphology information , and for subsets of objects , sdss spectra and sdss photo-@xmath54 results .",
    "objects detected in the ukidss nir bands but not in the sdss optical bands , and thus have very red colours , are not included in the current study .    the sample is initially restricted to @xmath67 , as extending to fainter magnitudes not only increases the photometry errors ( and thus reduces the effectiveness of the nir photo-@xmath54 routine ) , but also makes the optical spectroscopic follow - up more difficult .",
    "in addition , with a brighter @xmath2-band limit , objects that are faint in the optical must have very red optical ",
    "nir colours .",
    "this puts strong constraints on the range of possible identifications available , even if no identification is made from the spectrum .",
    "candidates lying leftward of the selection boundary in the @xmath53-space , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kx_gjk ] , are discarded .",
    "less than one per cent of the sdss dr7 quasars crossmatched to ukidss lie to the left of the selection line .",
    "the small percentage of quasars removed by application of the criterion will , by definition , be blue in @xmath50 , and are thus extremely unlikely to possess red restframe optical seds .",
    "the benefit of the kx - selection is evident from the elimination of the vast majority of galactic stars with more than 90 per cent of all cross - matched ukidss - sdss stellar objects removed in a single step .",
    "extensive effort has been devoted to the assignment of reliable photometric redshifts to low - redshift galaxies within the sdss ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "objects identified as galaxies with an sdss photo-@xmath54 in sdss dr7 were removed next .    at this stage , all cross - matched objects with properties consistent with main - sequence stars or resolved galaxies have been removed , leaving just apparently stellar objects to the right of the selection boundary in @xmath53-space .",
    "the list of such objects with @xmath67 is run through the nir photo-@xmath54 routine , producing lists of probable galaxies , stars , and quasar candidates .",
    "the probable galaxies and stars are removed from further consideration .",
    "the nir photo-@xmath54 code was tested on the full pilot kx survey catalogue of objects to ensure the robustness of the quasar , star and galaxy classifications .",
    "the performance of the routine for identifying all three classes of objects was found to be very good .",
    "the list of quasar - candidates constitutes the primary sample to be used to investigate the properties of objects identified via the use of nir - photometry that eluded the sdss quasar selection . to ensure the most efficient use of follow - up spectroscopic observations , two subsets of candidates",
    "are flagged as ` not to be followed - up spectroscopically ' .",
    "first , objects with sdss spectra are removed , as their identification is already known .",
    "second , objects with sdss spectroscopic quasar - target flags set , but no spectroscopic observations , are also removed . this restriction is discussed further in section  [ subsec : targets ] . both sub - samples form part of the final quasar catalogue .    the large number of relatively low - redshift quasar candidates are removed by restricting the sample to @xmath68 .",
    "the decision ensures that potential complications arising from quasar host galaxies do not impact on the completeness of the flux - limited nir - selected quasar sample . at low redshifts , not only",
    "can the colours of the candidates be altered by the combination of quasar+host galaxy flux , but the @xmath2-band flux from the galaxy can artificially boost the quasar+host system brighter than the flux limit .",
    "these issues can be problematic at significant ( @xmath69 ) redshifts for a @xmath67 sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "most importantly , given the restriction of the cross - matched ukidss - sdss sample to ` stellar ' objects , the @xmath68 selection ensures that genuine quasars are not systematically excluded due to the visibility of their host galaxies in the nir images . from a practical perspective",
    "the application of the @xmath68 criterion ensures that the resulting sample of quasars is dominated by relatively high redshift objects which possess longer path - lengths for the occurence of intervening absorption systems .",
    "finally , after all of these restrictions have been implemented , the sdss images of the quasar candidates are visually inspected to remove objects whose photometry has been compromised , for example , by nearby bright stars .",
    "there are a number of these in the survey area , and their removal reduces the effective area by a small percentage , as discussed in the appendix .",
    "a flow - chart describing the quasar candidate selection procedure is shown in fig .  [ fig : chart ] .",
    "in order to maximise the dynamic range of the survey in absolute magnitude at fixed redshift , while ensuring adequate sampling of the brightest quasars , a ` wedding cake ' survey geometry is adopted .",
    "thus , the entire survey area is complete to the brightest limits , with a smaller sub - region complete to fainter magnitudes and the smallest sub - region complete to the faintest limits .",
    "observations of the survey area utilised four telescopes over three observing semesters between 2009 may  2010",
    "as the candidates span six magnitudes in the @xmath5-band , smaller telescopes were used for the optically bright objects and an 8-metre class telescope was employed for the much less numerous nir - bright but optically faint objects .",
    "observations of the optically bright candidates located at @xmath70 ra @xmath71 ( ntt / vlt region ) were carried out with the efosc2 spectrograph @xcite on the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla observatory , and those at ra @xmath72 or ra @xmath73 ( ca region ) were observed with the cafos spectrograph on the 2.2 m telescope and mosca on the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto observatory .    the optically faint candidates in the ntt / vlt region were observed with the fors instrument on the european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) ut1 in service mode .",
    "the fainter candidates were only observed in this region .",
    "[ fig : coverage ] shows the location of the observed candidates and table  [ tab : allobs ] lists the details of the observations .",
    "moderate resolution spectra ( @xmath74 ) were obtained , generally sufficient for object identification . in total , 324 candidates were observed , and the total area of all the regions surveyed is 633 square degrees .",
    "the effective area surveyed , accounting for area missed due to bad photometry , among other effects , is 567.0 square degrees , and is described in the appendix .",
    "the completeness limits for the entire area are @xmath75 and @xmath76 . for the ntt / vlt region at ra @xmath22 210 , the completeness limits are @xmath75 and @xmath77 , and for ra @xmath7 210 ( hereinafter referred to as the ntt / vlt deep region ) , they are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the increased @xmath5-band depth at ra @xmath7 210 is because more faint targets were observed by the vlt within this area .",
    "it is worth noting that this faint @xmath5-band magnitude limit is nearing the detection limit of the sdss photometry , and the ntt / vlt deep region is still nearly 200 square degrees in size .",
    "the @xmath2-band magnitude and @xmath80 colour limits are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ivsk ] , and a summary of the three regions with their respective sizes in square degrees and magnitude limits is listed in table  [ tab : areas ] .",
    "some , but not all , of the available targets with magnitudes fainter than the limits listed in table  [ tab : areas ] were observed .",
    "these objects are included in the full kx - selected quasar catalogue described in section  [ sec : kxcatalogue ] .",
    "the bright magnitude limits are @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "only one candidate is removed by these restrictions , and it is very unlikely that a candidate with @xmath83 is a quasar at @xmath84 , as quasars of this bright luminosity are intrinsically very rare .",
    "inspection of the sdss dr7 quasar catalogue crossmatched to ukidss dr7 shows that of 20148 quasars with @xmath85 , there are only 11 with @xmath83 .",
    "the redshift range over which the catalogue is complete is @xmath86 .",
    "the low redshift cutoff was implemented in the candidate selection , and the high redshift limit is determined from the completeness investigation in section  [ subsec : completeness ] , where it is found that the completeness of the nir photo-@xmath54 selection drops rapidly at @xmath87 .",
    "the initial area of sky covered by the selection algorithm is 633.2 square degrees , but this is reduced by the loss of surveyed area due to requiring the initial candidates to be unresolved and regions of sky near bright stars that affect the photometry .",

    "<S> the results of a large area , @xmath0600 deg@xmath1 , @xmath2-band flux - limited spectroscopic survey for luminous quasars are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the survey utilises the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) large area survey ( las ) in regions of sky within the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) footprint . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-band excess ( kx ) of all quasars with respect to galactic stars is exploited in combination with a photometric redshift / classification scheme to identify quasar candidates for spectroscopic follow - up observations . </S>",
    "<S> the data contained within this investigation will be able to provide new constraints on the fraction of luminous quasars reddened by dust with @xmath3 0.5mag . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic sample is defined using the @xmath2-band , @xmath4 , and sdss @xmath5-band limits of @xmath6 19.5 , 19.7 and 22.0 over sky areas of 287 , 150 and 196 deg@xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the survey includes @xmath73200 known quasars from the sdss and more than 250 additional confirmed quasars from the kx - selection . </S>",
    "<S> a well - defined sub - sample of quasars in the redshift interval @xmath8 includes 1152 objects from the sdss and 172 additional kx - selected quasars . </S>",
    "<S> the quasar selection is @xmath9  per  cent complete with respect to known sdss quasars and @xmath9  per  cent efficient , largely independent of redshift and @xmath5-band magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the new kx - selected quasars confirm the known redshift - dependent effectiveness of the sdss quasar selection and provide a sample of luminous quasars experiencing intermediate levels of extinction by dust . </S>",
    "<S> the catalogue represents an important step towards the assembly of a well - defined sample of luminous quasars that may be used to investigate the properties of quasars experiencing intermediate levels of dust extinction within their host galaxies or due intervening absorption line systems .    </S>",
