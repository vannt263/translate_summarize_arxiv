    "on the other hand , the large dielectric constant of pbse nc solids reduces the coulomb interaction , making it likely that disorder dominates .",
    "were many - body interactions strongly affecting the transport , we would expect the dependence of the current on field to change with gate voltage .",
    "figure [ fig : vgdc3 ] shows that there is little such change .",
    "an alternative explanation for the small activation energy seen in the zero bias conductance is that it arises from variable - range hopping ( vrh ) as has been speculated.@xcite the temperature range of fig .",
    "[ fig : tempdep ] is not large enough to distinguish unambiguously simply activated conduction from vrh without a coulomb gap .",
    "however , analysis of the data shows that if vrh is the dominant mechanism , then the hopping distance in the temperature range of our experiments is comparable to the distance between ncs .",
    "this would make the model no different from that of nearest - neighbor hopping , which we assume above .",
    "it is also difficult to understand how others find vrh with a coulomb gap above 4 k.@xcite the high dielectric constant found in pbse ncs@xcite indicates that a coulomb gap would become apparent only well below 4 k.",
    "by measuring the dependence of current on source - drain voltage , gate voltage and temperature , we have shown that our pbse nc solids are well described by a simple model of hopping between the highest energy filled states of the ncs .",
    "after annealing , the fermi energy is close to the edge of the highest - occupied valence level , as evinced by the small activation energy of the current and by field - effect measurements , which give a density of states close to that expected for the 1s@xmath0 band .",
    "the activation energy is given by the energy to excite holes from acceptor states and activation over additional barriers resulting from the site disorder . by applying high electric fields , we separate these two components and measure the length scales associated with them . not surprisingly , we find that the separation of a hole from an acceptor state occurs over a distance comparable to the spacing between the surface of the nc and its core , and the length scale associated with motion through the nc array is the center - to - center distance between ncs .",
    "furthermore , the energy dispersion that limits the hole motion once it is free is about the same size as the energy dispersion measured by optical spectroscopy of ncs in a colloidal suspension .",
    "the density of states extracted from field - effect data is consistent with this as well .",
    "all of this suggests that the variation in energies of the localized intrinsic states is largely determined by the small variation in size of the ncs .",
