    "the atmospheric and solar neutrino masses and mixing angles are given below    * @xmath0 @xmath1 * @xmath2 @xmath3    with an approximate mixing matrix given by @xmath4 for this talk , i will assume three light neutrinos .",
    "recall , the observed small neutrino masses can naturally be generated via the see - saw mechanism .",
    "the @xmath5 neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the dirac rl ( majorana rr ) mass matrix .",
    "of course , the main problem with neutrino mixing angles is the fact that they are significantly larger than ckm mixing .",
    "these large mixing angles may be obtained from one ( or a combination ) of the following sources ",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 ; or @xmath9 ( the charged lepton mass matrix ) . in the models presented below",
    ", the origin of large neutrino mixing angles is in @xmath7 .",
    "consider now the fgy @xcite ansatz given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the two right - handed ( sterile ) neutrinos and @xmath12 this neutrino mass matrix ansatz is expressed in the lepton flavor eigenbasis .",
    "the dimensionful parameters @xmath13 are chosen to satisfy the relations @xmath14 for maximal atmospheric mixing angle and @xmath15 for a large , but not maximal , solar mixing angle .",
    "in addition , due to the zeros in the mass matrix ansatz , there is only one non - vanishing cp violating angle , @xmath16 . upon integrating out the heavy sterile neutrinos ( @xmath17 )",
    ", we obtain the @xmath5 fgy light neutrino mass matrix given by @xmath18 the neutrino mass eigenvalues and small mixing angle are given by @xmath19      a detailed @xmath20 analysis of the fgy ansatz including atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation data was performed by raidal and strumia @xcite .",
    "their best fit then makes predictions for @xmath21 , observable in planned long baseline experiments , and for the effective electron neutrino mass measured in neutrinoless double beta decay , @xmath22 mev , which is unobservable in any planned experiment .",
    "in addition , rs perform a detailed analysis of leptogenesis with fgy .",
    "they find two successful solutions providing an acceptable cosmological baryon asymmetry [ _ this is the rs ambiguity _ ] .",
    "one with @xmath23 in this case , the prediction for cp violating neutrino oscillation is given by @xmath24 in a supersymmetric generalization of fgy , they predict the lepton number flavor violating branching ratios @xmath25 where @xmath26 . the other with @xmath27 they find @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "we now obtain the fgy texture in a supersymmtric theory with an [ su(2)@xmath30u(1)]@xmath31 family symmetry protecting the zeros @xcite .",
    "this is a theory of leptons with the 3 families of electroweak doublets given by @xmath32 .",
    "the first two families transform as a doublet under the su(2 ) family symmetry with @xmath33 , and then @xmath34 is an su(2 ) singlet .",
    "the superpotential for the neutrino mass sector is given by ( we will discuss the charged lepton mass sector next ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a new scale satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "the familon fields @xmath38 are assumed to get the following vacuum expectation values [ vevs ] breaking the family symmetry and generating neutrino masses .",
    "we have , in complete generality , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in addition the two right - handed neutrinos @xmath41 obtain majorana masses when the su(2 ) singlet familon fields get vevs given by @xmath42 .",
    "the family symmetry [ with specific u(1 ) charges for all the fields , as discussed in more detail in the paper @xcite ] is sufficient to make this the most general superpotential consistent with the symmetry .",
    "hence the zeros of the fgy ansatz are obtained , without fine tuning .",
    "when the higgs doublet @xmath43 gets a vev at the weak scale given by @xmath44 we finally obtain the fgy neutrino mass matrix with the parameters @xmath45 given below . @xmath46 note , however , unlike fgy we must now consider the charged lepton mass matrix which is also constrained by the family symmetry . until we do this , we can not be certain that we have obtained the fgy ansatz in the lepton flavor basis .",
    "consider the superpotential for charged leptons given by @xmath47 where the left - handed anti - leptons @xmath48 are su(2 ) singlets .",
    "when the higgs @xmath49 gets a vev given by @xmath50 we obtain the charged lepton @xmath5 mass matrix below @xmath51 with @xmath52 satisfying @xmath53 .",
    "note the parameters @xmath54 are , up to order one coefficients , the same as @xmath45 appearing in the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the charged lepton mass eigenvalues are approximately given by @xmath55 and the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonalized by the bi - unitary transformation @xmath56 with the unitary matrix defining the left - handed mass eigenstates satisfying @xmath57 .",
    "using this matrix we finally obtain the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis .",
    "we find @xmath58 \\ ; u_e   \\approx { \\cal m}_{fgy } &   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath59 note , the ratios @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be adjusted to accommodate bi - large neutrino mixing .    as a bonus",
    "we now see that the ratio of majorana neutrino masses @xmath62 is fixed .",
    "we find @xmath63 .",
    "thus @xmath64 and the rs ambiguity is resolved !",
    "note , an su(2 ) family symmetry in susy theories is desirable for completely different reasons . it has been shown that it can ameliorate the susy flavor problem @xcite .",
    "for example , prior to su(2 ) symmetry breaking the first and second generation sleptons are degenerate .",

    "in addition , the fg mass @xmath86 necessarily includes so(10 ) breaking vevs with @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 are the so(10 ) breaking vevs in the adjoint representation of so(10 ) with @xmath89 corresponding to the u(1 ) in so(10 ) which preserves su(5 ) , and @xmath90 the standard weak hypercharge .",
    "@xmath91 are arbitrary parameters . upon integrating out the fg fields we obtain the effective fermion mass operators in the figure . finally upon giving the familon fields vevs we obtain the effective yukawa couplings below .",
    "@xmath92 with @xmath93 the small parameters are given by @xmath94 ; all other parameters are numbers of order one .",
    "all these parameters are fit to the low energy data via a detailed @xmath20 analysis .",
    "the model has the following nice features .",
    "the family hierarchy is obtained via the hierarchy of family symmetry breaking @xmath105 where the first ( second ) breaking is due to the familon vevs determining the small ratios @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) . as a result",
    "the 3rd family is much heavier than the 2nd family ; is then heavier than the 1st family .",
    "we incorporate the following mass patterns  1 ) an approximate georgi - jarlskog mechanism  naturally \" with the familon vev @xmath108 giving @xmath109 and @xmath110 ; 2 ) third generation yukawa unification with @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 and 3 ) @xmath114 leads to @xmath115 even though @xmath116 .",
    "the model has 10 yukawa parameters ( 6 real coefficients and 4 phases ) to fit 13 fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "varying these 10 yukawa parameters [ three gauge ( @xmath118 ) and 7 soft susy breaking parameters ] at @xmath119 we use the two ( one ) loop rg equations for dimensionless ( dimensionful ) variables to obtain the @xmath20 function at @xmath120 .",
    "all observables at @xmath120 are evaluated including one loop threshold corrections .",
    "the result of the @xmath20 analysis , using the code of t. blazek ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , is given in the table .",
    "the fit is quite good .",
    "in particular there are only 10 yukawa parameters with 16 independent fermion mass and mixing angle observables .",
    "let us now consider neutrino masses in this model .",
    "the model has three right - handed neutrinos contained in the fields @xmath123 .",
    "moreover the dirac neutrino yukawa matrix is given by @xmath124 with @xmath125 this then gives the dirac lr neutrino mass matrix  @xmath126 .",
    "the field @xmath129 ( and another field @xmath130 ) are assumed to obtain vevs in the right - handed neutrino direction .",
    "in fact , these vevs are necessary ( along with the @xmath131 vevs ) to break so(10 ) to the standard model .",
    "given @xmath132 , @xmath133 and the familon vevs we obtain the effective neutrino mass terms given by @xmath134 where @xmath135      note , defining the @xmath139 dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath140 and the @xmath141 right - handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath142 we finally obtain the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath143 \\ ; u_e .\\ ] ] hence we obtain the frampton , glashow & yanagida ansatz without any fine - tuning . in particular , the zeros are exact and fixed by the family symmetry",
    ". this may be seen by the intermediate calculation below .",
    "in addition , bi - large mixing requires significant constraints on the parameters @xmath145 .",
    "maximal atmospheric neutrino oscillation requires @xmath146 , whereas large mixing for solar neutrino oscillations requires @xmath147 of order @xmath148 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratios @xmath61 and @xmath60 are , now , also constrained by charged fermion masses and mixing angles . without performing a joint @xmath20 analysis ( including both charged fermions and neutrinos ) we can still make the following observations .",
    "the fit to charged fermion masses naturally gives @xmath149 .",
    "hence given @xmath150 we find @xmath151 . with regards",
    "@xmath152 we have @xmath153",
    ". moreover @xmath154 gives @xmath155 which apparently requires fine - tuning of order 1 in 10 to get @xmath15 .",
    "clearly in order to test this model , we must perform an extended @xmath20 analysis including both charged fermions and neutrinos .",
    "note , there are only two new parameters in the neutrino sector which can be fit to the solar and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences .    finally we find @xmath156 and thus @xmath157 .",
    "unfortunately , leptogenesis is more complicated in this model since we must first identify the heavy neutrino mass eigenstates and their lepton / higgs couplings .",
    "moreover there are , in principle , more cp violating phases .      the frampton - glashow - yanagida neutrino mass matrix ansatz has several nice features .",
    "since it has only one cp violating angle it can , in principle , correlate the sign of the matter - anti - matter asymmetry with cp violating neutrino oscillations .",
    "unfortunately , the raidal - strumia analysis uncovered an ambiguity which allows either sign of the cp violating angle for successful leptogenesis , depending on whether the right - handed neutrino masses satisfies @xmath158 or @xmath159 !",
    "in addition the fgy ansatz provides a natural framework for bi - large neutrino mixing !    in this talk we obtained the fgy ansatz in a supersymmetric model with an [ su(2 ) @xmath30 u(1)]@xmath31 family symmetry .",
    "this had two advantages , 1 ) the fgy ansatz is fixed by the family symmetry and 2 ) it resolves the rs ambiguity .",
    "this is because the same family symmetry acting on neutrinos also constrains the charged fermion masses . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of right - handed neutrino masses is fixed by the ratio of @xmath160 for atmospheric and solar neutrinos and the ratio of charged fermion masses .",
    "it is also important to note that we are only able to obtain the normal hierarchy for neutrino masses .",
    "the second model presented in this talk was a susy so(10 ) model with an [ su(2 ) @xmath30 u(1)@xmath161@xmath31 family symmetry .",
    "this model is significantly more constrained since it relates all fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "there are only two new arbitrary parameters in the neutrino sector which are fixed by the neutrino mass differences .",
    "nevertheless , we  naturally \" obtain the fgy ansatz for neutrinos ( in a theory which initially starts with 3 right - handed neutrinos and 3 so(10 ) singlet neutrinos ) .",
    "we find a large neutrino mixing angle for atmospheric neutrino oscillations  naturally . \" on the other hand , an extended @xmath20 analysis must be performed to see if we can obtain a large solar mixing angle .",
    "if a good fit is obtained for neutrino masses and mixing , it will then be very interesting to analyze cp violation and leptogenesis in this model .        9 p.  h.  frampton , s.  l.  glashow and t.  yanagida , phys .",
