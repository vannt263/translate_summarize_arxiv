    "in a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) , an in - plane magnetic field @xmath3 applied parallel to the 2d plane is used to control and investigate quantum hall ( qh ) states . for an ideal 2des with zero thickness ,",
    "@xmath3 couples to the system only through the zeeman energy , while the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath4 couples with the orbital degree of freedom as well . that is , by tilting the magnetic field away from normal to the 2des while keeping @xmath4 fixed , the zeeman energy is controlled without changing other energies .",
    "this technique has been used to elucidate effects of spins.@xcite in a bilayer system , which consists of two parallel 2dess , the importance of @xmath5 increases because electrons are subjected to lorentz force and acquire an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phase @xcite when they tunnel between the two layers .",
    "lorentz force decreases the tunneling energy gap @xmath6.@xcite this effect , together with the enhancement of the zeeman energy , is widely used to investigate ground and excited states of bilayer qh states.@xcite the ab phase affects ground state properties of a coherent bilayer qh state.@xcite    in addition , coupling of the subbands and landau levels ( lls ) in tilted magnetic fields should affect qh states in a system with more than two occupied spatial subbands . the subband - ll coupling has been manifested as anticrossings between lls belonging to different subbands in quasi-2d heterojunctions @xcite or parabolic quantum wells.@xcite this phenomenon provides a new tool to investigate bilayer qh states .",
    "it is therefore important to study the subband - ll coupling in a system with well - defined bilayer potential .",
    "moreover , since the coupling changes the microscopic properties of wave functions , it affects many - body states as discussed for a collective mode in the coherent bilayer qh state @xcite or @xmath3-induced reorientation of the stripe phase.@xcite    in this work , we carried out transport experiments in tilted magnetic fields using a double - quantum - well ( dqw ) sample , in which the potential symmetry can be tuned by gates deposited on the front and back sides of the sample . in a perpendicular field ,",
    "crossings between lls belonging to different subbands are manifested by a missing or weakening of the qh states at integer fillings . when the dqw is tilted in the magnetic field",
    ", the subband - ll coupling leads to anticrossings . the anticrossing gap increases with tilting angle @xmath2 . in a symmetric dwq , it becomes larger than the zeeman energy at @xmath0 and larger than the cyclotron energy at @xmath1 , so that crossings are avoided between lls that are not coupled to each other .",
    "when the dqw is asymmetric , coupling of lls in the same subband occur , modifying the anticrossings and the avoided crossings .",
    "we calculated the energy levels from the viewpoint of a single - particle picture and show that they reproduce experiments very well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section[theory ] describes a theory by which energy levels in a bilayer system subjected to tilted magnetic fields can be calculated . in sec.[experiment ] , we describe the dqw sample and the experimental setup . in sec.[result ] , the experimental results are presented and compared with the calculation .",

    ", we neglect the spin degree of freedom for simplicity .",
    "electrons subjected to a tilted magnetic field @xmath7 in a dqw potential @xmath8 are described by the hamiltonian , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the effective mass .",
    "the first four terms describe electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field , where energy levels are lls in bonding ( @xmath11 ) and antibonding ( @xmath12 ) subbands .",
    "the last two terms of eq.([hamiltonian ] ) stem from the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath13 term causes a diamagnetic shift , which merely modifies the energies of the bonding and antibonding states .",
    "the last term is most important for this work : the cross term @xmath14 couples the subband and landau quantizations .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath15 can be expressed as shown in table[matrix ] by using the eigen states in a perpendicular field @xmath16 as a basis set , where @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 represent the landau - orbit and subband indices , respectively . in a perpendicular magnetic field ,",
    "the eigen energy of each basis is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cyclotron frequency due to @xmath4 , @xmath23 is the energy gap between the bonding and antibonding states , which equals @xmath6 in a symmetric potential and increases with potential asymmetry .",
    "when finite @xmath3 is applied , these diagonal elements undergo a diamagnetic shift of @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the cyclotron frequency and magnetic length associated with @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "more importantly , off - diagonal elements arise from the @xmath14 term of eq.([hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "since @xmath27 works as the raising @xmath28 and lowering @xmath29 operators of the landau orbit , it couples lls when the landau indices differ by one , where @xmath30 is the magnetic length in @xmath4 . as a result , the matrix element between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is @xmath33 where @xmath34 . the spin degree of freedom ( @xmath35 ) can be easily included by adding @xmath36 to the diagonal terms , where @xmath37 is the zeeman energy .",
    "it is worth mentioning the effects of the symmetry of the confining potential @xmath8 .",
    "figure[levelcoupling ] illustrates the coupling of energy levels in a bilayer system .",
    "when @xmath8 is symmetric , i.e. @xmath38 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric states , respectively . since @xmath39 is an antisymmetric function , the intra - subband coupling @xmath40 ( dotted arrows in fig.[levelcoupling ] ) vanishes because of the symmetry , although the inter - subband coupling @xmath41 ( solid arrows in fig.[levelcoupling ] ) is finite .",
    "this symmetry effect causes a selection rule : lls in different subbands couple only when the difference between the landau indices is odd as shown by solid arrows in fig.[levelcoupling ] .",
    "when @xmath8 is asymmetric , the intra - subband coupling ( dotted arrows in fig.[levelcoupling ] ) is non - zero , where the odd / even rule becomes less clear .",
    "the sample used in this work consists of two 200- - wide gaas quantum wells separated by a thin 10- - al@xmath42ga@xmath43as barrier , processed into a 50-@xmath44m - wide hall bar with ohmic contacts connecting both layers.@xcite @xmath6 decreases from 32 to 23k when the total electron density of the two layers is increased from @xmath45 to @xmath46@xmath47 .",

    "the electron densities in the front layer @xmath51 and the back layer @xmath52 are controlled by the front- and back - gate biases , respectively .",
    "this enables us to control the potential symmetry and @xmath53 independently .",
    "measurements were performed with the sample mounted in the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 30mk . by using an @xmath54-@xmath55 rotator , we can tilt the sample in the magnetic field , which has a maximum strength of 13.5 t .",

    "further tilting of the sample ( @xmath69 ) causes them to disappear [ fig.[dn1](b ) , right ] . in fig.[dn1](c ) , activation energy gaps at different magnetic fields with fixed filling factors of @xmath57 and 4 for several tilting angles are shown , where the activation energy gap @xmath81 is determined from the temperature dependence of @xmath82 . for @xmath78 , the two sharp minima in @xmath81 first come close to each other @xmath83 and then merge @xmath84 before turning into a single broad minimum @xmath85 . for @xmath57 , @xmath81 becomes almost field - independent already at @xmath86 .",
    "the experimental results are compared with calculated energy levels [ fig.[dn1](a ) ] .",
    "we note that for the calculation we used enlarged spin splitting @xmath87 , which effectively incorporates the exchange energy ; the value of 2.3 is deduced by the level crossing points for @xmath79 . in a tilted field , the like - spin levels @xmath88 and @xmath89 couple , which causes the anticrossings between these levels with the gap increasing in proportional to @xmath90 [ eq.([offdiagonal ] ) ] . as a result ,",
    "an energy gap opens in the qh states at @xmath57 and 5 [ figs.[dn1](a ) , center and ( c ) ] . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath91 is a good quantum number even in a tilted field , the coupling between levels with opposite spins does not occur .",
    "however , as shown in fig.[dn1](a ) , right , the @xmath79 crossings can be avoided when the anticrossing gap exceeds the spin splitting .",
    "we refer to this type of disappearance of the ll crossings as `` avoided crossings '' to distinguish it from `` anticrossings '' .",
    "the overall similarity between figs.[dn1](a ) and ( b ) clearly shows that the subband - ll coupling is enough to explain the disappearance of all the ll crossings for @xmath63 .",
    "these results demonstrate that the subband - ll coupling exerts strong influence on bilayer qh states even at small @xmath92 particularly when lls belonging to different subbands are close to degeneracy .     around @xmath75 crossings at @xmath93 - 7 crossings for ( a ) @xmath58 , ( b ) @xmath94 , and ( c ) @xmath95 .",

    "next , we show results for larger @xmath2 , where ll crossings for @xmath75 disappear .",

    "similar to the data for @xmath63 , at @xmath58 there are broad ( sharp ) features for @xmath67 @xmath103 at odd ( even ) @xmath104 . however , the data at @xmath105 show that the behavior of the @xmath75 crossings is different from that of @xmath63 [ fig.[dn2](b ) ] .",
    "namely , the @xmath106 crossing vanishes leaving the @xmath107 crossing at @xmath108 t almost intact .",
    "the absence of the anticrossing for @xmath67 at @xmath93 and 7 indicates that there is no subband - ll coupling for @xmath75 , consistent with the symmetry arguments .",
    "when the sample is tilted further ( @xmath74 ) , all the crossings for @xmath75 disappear [ fig.[dn2](c ) ] .",
    "the behavior of @xmath75 crossings can be explained as the avoided crossings caused by the subband - ll coupling for @xmath63 , not for @xmath75 .",
    "when the anticrossing gap for @xmath63 becomes larger than @xmath109 , the @xmath106 crossing for @xmath75 is avoided as schematically shown in fig.[dn2](d ) .",
    "subsequently , as the gap exceeds @xmath110 , ll crossings for @xmath67 and 1 are avoided .",
    "the calculated energy levels agree with experiments on not only the sequence of the avoidance but also field positions of the crossings .",

    "namely , the disappearance of the crossings for @xmath100 first occurs for @xmath67 at @xmath71 and 9 , while that for @xmath97 starts from @xmath106 at @xmath111 .",
    "this is evidence of the anticrossing for @xmath100 at @xmath112 and the avoided crossings for @xmath97 , confirming the odd / even selection rule .",
