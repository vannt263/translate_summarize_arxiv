    "pion - pion ( @xmath1 ) scattering at low energies is the simplest and best - understood hadron - hadron scattering process .",
    "its simplicity and tractability follow from the fact that the pions are identified as the pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . for this reason ,",
    "the low - momentum interactions of pions are strongly constrained by the approximate chiral symmetries , more so than other hadrons .",
    "the scattering lengths for @xmath1 scattering in the s - wave are uniquely predicted at leading order ( lo ) in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3-pt )  @xcite : @xmath4 at the charged pion mass .",
    "subleading orders in the chiral expansion of the @xmath1 amplitude give rise to perturbatively - small deviations from the tree level , and contain both calculable non - analytic contributions and analytic terms with new coefficients that are not determined by chiral symmetry alone  @xcite . in order to have predictive power at subleading orders",
    ", these coefficients must be obtained from experiment or computed with lattice qcd .",
    "recent experimental efforts have been made to compute the s - wave @xmath1 scattering lengths , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath0 ) : e865  @xcite ( @xmath8 decays ) , cern dirac  @xcite ( pionium lifetime ) and cern na48/2  @xcite ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "unfortunately , these experiments do not provide stringent constraints on @xmath7 .",
    "however , a theoretical determination of s - wave @xmath1 scattering lengths which makes use of experimental data has reached a remarkable level of precision  @xcite : @xmath10 these values result from the roy equations  @xcite , which use dispersion theory to relate scattering data at high energies to the scattering amplitude near threshold . in a striking recent result",
    ", this technology has allowed a model - independent determination of the mass and width of the resonance with vacuum quantum numbers ( the @xmath11 meson ) that appears in the @xmath1 scattering amplitude  @xcite .",
    "several low - energy constants of one - loop @xmath3-pt are critical inputs to the roy equation analysis .",
    "one can take the values of these low - energy constants computed with lattice qcd by the milc collaboration  @xcite as inputs to the roy equations , and obtain results for the scattering lengths consistent with the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .    a direct lattice qcd determination of threshold @xmath1 scattering is problematic in two respects .",
    "first , the occurrence of disconnected diagrams in the @xmath6 s - wave channel renders a determination of that amplitude very costly in terms of computer time , given the current state of lattice algorithms , and is thus beyond our current capabilities . as a result ,",
    "lattice qcd efforts have focused on the @xmath0 channel .",
    "the second difficulty is due to the fact that lattice qcd calculations are performed on a euclidean lattice .",
    "the maiani - testa theorem demonstrates that s - matrix elements can not be determined from lattice calculations of @xmath12-point green s functions at infinite volume , except at kinematic thresholds  @xcite .",
    "this difficulty was overcome by lscher , who showed that by computing the energy levels of two - particle states in the finite - volume lattice , the @xmath13 scattering amplitude can be recovered  @xcite .",
    "the energy levels of the two interacting particles are found to deviate from those of two non - interacting particles by an amount that depends on the scattering amplitude and varies inversely with the lattice spatial volume .",
    "the first lattice calculations of @xmath1 scattering were performed in quenched qcd  @xcite , and the first full - qcd calculation of @xmath1 scattering ( the scattering length and phase - shift ) was carried through by the cp - pacs collaboration , who exploited the finite - volume strategy to study @xmath0 , s - wave scattering with two flavors ( @xmath14 ) of improved wilson fermions  @xcite , with pion masses in the range @xmath15 .",
    "the first fully - dynamical calculation of the @xmath0 @xmath1 scattering length with three flavors ( @xmath16 ) of light quarks was performed by some of the present authors using domain - wall valence quarks on asqtad - improved staggered sea quarks at four pion masses in the range @xmath17 at a single lattice spacing , @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "that work quoted a value of the scattering length extrapolated to the physical point of @xmath19 where the first uncertainty is statistical , the second is a systematic due to fitting and the third uncertainty is due to truncation of the chiral expansion .    in this paper",
    "we update our fully - dynamical mixed - action calculation of the @xmath0 @xmath1 scattering length .",
    "two recent developments motivate an update : i ) we have vastly increased statistics at the three light - quark masses studied in the original publication ; ii ) @xmath1 scattering has been computed with mixed - action @xmath3-pt ( ma@xmath3-pt ) at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite both for two and three flavors of light quarks . our updated result is : @xmath20 where the statistical and systematic uncertainties have been combined in quadrature . this result is consistent with all previous determinations within uncertainties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : method ] details of our mixed - action lattice qcd calculation are presented .",
    "we refer the reader interested in a more comprehensive treatment and discussion to our earlier papers .",
    "discussion of the relevant correlation functions and an outline of the methodology and fitting procedures can also be found in this section .",
    "the results of the lattice calculation and the analysis with two- and three - flavor ma@xmath3-pt are presented in section  [ sec : extrapolate ] . in section  [ sec : systerrors ] , the various sources of systematic uncertainty are identified and quantified . in section  [ sec : conclude ] we conclude .",
    "the computation in this paper uses the mixed - action lattice qcd scheme developed by lhpc  @xcite .",
    "domain - wall fermion propagators were generated from a smeared source on @xmath16 asqtad - improved  @xcite coarse configurations generated with rooted staggered sea quarks  @xcite .",
    "hypercubic - smeared ( hyp - smeared )  @xcite gauge links were used in the domain - wall fermion action to improve chiral symmetry ( further details about the mixed - action scheme can be found in refs .",
    "the mixed - action calculations we have performed involved computing the valence - quark propagators using the domain - wall formulation of lattice fermions , on each gauge - field configuration of an ensemble of the coarse milc lattices that are generated using the staggered formulation of lattice fermions  @xcite and taking the fourth root of the fermion determinant , i.e. domain - wall valence quarks on a rooted - staggered sea . in the continuum limit",
    "the @xmath14 staggered action has an @xmath21 chiral symmetry due to the four - fold taste degeneracy of each flavor , and each pion has 15 degenerate additional partners . at finite lattice spacing this symmetry is broken and the taste multiplets are no longer degenerate , but have splittings that are @xmath22 . while there is no proof ,",
    "there are arguments to suggest that taking the fourth root of the fermion determinant recovers the contribution from a single dirac fermion  .",
    "the results of this paper assume that the fourth - root trick recovers the correct continuum limit of qcd .",
    "when determining the mass of the valence quarks there is an ambiguity due to the non - degeneracy of the 16 staggered bosons associated with each pion .",
    "one could choose to match to the taste - singlet meson or to any of the mesons that become degenerate in the continuum limit .",
    "given that the effective field theory exists to describe such calculations at finite lattice spacing , the effects of matching can be described , and removed , by effective field theory calculations appropriate to the choice of matching .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 is the mass - difference between a valence meson and the staggered taste - singlet meson when the valence pion is tuned to be exactly degenerate with the lightest staggered pion . on the coarse milc lattices with @xmath18 ( and @xmath24 ) it is numerically determined ( in lattice units ) that @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "a summary of the lattice parameters and resources used in this work is given in table  [ tab : milccnfs ] . in order to generate large statistics on the existing milc configurations ,",
    "multiple propagators from sources displaced both temporally and spatially on the lattice were computed .",
    "the correlators were blocked so that one average correlator per configuration was used in the subsequent jackknife statistical analysis ( that will be described later ) .",
    ".the parameters of the milc gauge configurations and domain - wall propagators used in this work .",
    "the subscript @xmath26 denotes light quark ( up and down ) , and @xmath27 denotes the strange quark .",
    "the superscript @xmath28 denotes the bare - quark mass for the domain - wall fermion propagator calculation .",
    "the last column is the number of configurations times the number of sources per configuration . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.5 in    what has enabled such an improvement in precision over our previous result on the coarse milc lattices is the recent understanding of the lattice - spacing artifacts accomplished with mixed - action chiral perturbation theory .",
    "while it will be quite useful to have results at another lattice spacing and at another lattice volume , we have reached the level of precision where we require knowledge of isospin violating effects in order to further reduce the uncertainty in the physical @xmath1 scattering lengths ; i.e. those that can be compared to experiment .",
    "one somewhat surprising result of our analysis is that one of the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty in our calculation is due to residual chiral symmetry breaking in the domain - wall valence quarks for the lattice parameters we have chosen .",
    "clearly this systematic can be reduced by improving our choice of domain - wall parameters .",
    "lattice qcd is currently in a precision age insofar as single - particle properties are concerned .",
    "the precise prediction for the intrinsic two - particle property presented here is a remarkable demonstration of the power of combining a lattice qcd calculation with the model - independent constraints of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we thank r.  edwards for help with the qdp++/chroma programming environment  @xcite with which the calculations discussed here were performed .",
    "awl would like to thank claude bernard for providing a program to determine meson mass splittings in lattice units .",
