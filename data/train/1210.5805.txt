    "granular flows can clog unpredictably , often with catastrophic consequences as seen in grain silo failures@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is an example of jamming , where a disordered system undergoes a sudden arrest in dynamics , leading to a transition from a fluid - like to a solid - like state@xcite .",
    "unlike the jams that develop in spatially homogeneous systems , however , jams in hopper or silo flows occur under extremely inhomogeneous conditions as a gravity - driven flow enclosed by rigid walls converges towards an orifice where stable arches can form@xcite .",
    "hopper flows are self - organized , being neither pressure nor density controlled , with a steady state that develops from an interplay between gravitational forcing , constraints due to the walls , and the interactions between grains@xcite .",
    "the flow is also driven by body forces , and the boundary is thus not a source of energy .",
    "instead , the boundary imposes constraints on the flow volume , is a source of frictional interaction , and randomizes the flow through grain - wall collisions .",
    "the dynamical principles that lead to jamming in such self - regulated flows are not well understood .",
    "experimental investigations of two - dimensional ( 2d ) hopper flows show that these flows remain collisional near jamming@xcite , and show large force fluctuations@xcite and transient arch formation@xcite . in previous studies@xcite",
    ", we have shown that collisional flows with no extended contacts develop transient force chains that are are sustained by correlated collisions .",
    "the origin of these correlations is the inelasticity of the collisions , and the stress is purely due to momentum transfer .",
    "focusing on the homogeneous flow in the bulk of the hopper , we established the emergence of growing length and time scales as the flow approached jamming@xcite .",
    "flows in hoppers , however , are characterized by strong gradients , such as a shear - layer at the walls@xcite , and rapid flow regions near the orifice .",
    "in addition to these heterogeneities in the average flow profile , the fluctuations in the flow have well - defined spatial structure , such as transient arches@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the dynamics in regions with strong gradients and their vital role in controlling the approach to jamming .    using event - driven simulations of a purely collisional , gravity - driven flow",
    ", we monitor the temporal variation of the flow in boxes that are a few grain diameters in size .",
    "we observe that the approach to jamming in the collisional non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) is signaled by the flow becoming intermittent with time intervals spanning many collisions in which the flow alternately slows down and speeds up . during some of these intervals ,",
    "the flow is slow ( fast ) throughout the hopper but in other instances , the slowing down ( speeding up ) is localized in the bulk or near the boundaries .",
    "these fluctuations are particularly strong in hoppers with small openings@xcite .",
    "in addition to the marked gradients in the flow field , the fluctuation - statistics of the velocity show large variations both along and transverse to the flow direction .",
    "more importantly , the spatial patterns evolve with flow rate and can change quite dramatically as the flow approaches jamming .",
    "in particular , we observe a flowing regime , and a pre - jamming regime distinguished by the spatial behavior of the velocity relaxation . in a rare jamming event that spans millions of collisions ,",
    "we see evidence of the boundaries frustrating the tendency to develop a uniform , steady flow in response to the gravitational forcing .",
    "our event - driven simulation is based on a particle dynamics model used by denniston and li @xcite and is described in detail in earlier papers@xcite .",
    "the system consists of 1,000 non - deformable disks falling under gravity in a 2d rectangular hopper with a tapered base ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vfield ] ) . the disks are bidisperse , with diameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; collisions between particles are inelastic but frictionless",
    ", so momentum transfer occurs along the center - to - center vector of colliding particles . the transformation in relative velocity between colliding particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 is defined in terms of a coefficient of restitution @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the particle velocities before and after the collision , and @xmath8 is a unit vector along the center - to - center direction .",
    "all inter - particle collisions become elastic below a relative velocity threshold @xmath9 to avoid inelastic collapse@xcite .",
    "particle - wall collisions are inelastic , with frictional drag at the walls modeled by a tangential coefficient of restitution @xmath10 , allowing the flow of grains through the outlet at the bottom of the system to reach a steady - state . particles exiting the system at the base",
    "are reintroduced at random lateral positions at the top of the hopper .",
    "all collisions in this event - driven simulation are instantaneous , and particles can not form temporally extended contacts with one another .",
    "the simulation moves forward from collision to collision , and instantaneous snapshots of the system are reconstructed from the state of the system before and after the relevant collisions to determine particle positions and velocities at equally spaced time intervals .",
    "the overall flow rate is set by the particle - wall friction coefficient and the size of the opening and varies linearly with opening size , as we show in figure  [ fig : vfield ] .",
    "the mass of the smaller grains and the acceleration of gravity @xmath11 are set to 1 , and all lengths are expressed in units of the smaller particle diameter @xmath0 . in these units ,",
    "the length and width of the rectangular region are 76.5 and 20 respectively , the angle of the tapered base is 45 degrees , and the size of the opening at the base is varied between 10 and 4.5 .",
    "the simulation parameters for the collisions are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the time taken for free fall of a particle through its own diameter is @xmath15 , and the average time between collisions for a given particle is on the order of @xmath16 .",
    "the development of extended contacts is , of course , important for sustaining a jam .",
    "it is not clear , however , if the approach to jamming is qualitatively altered by the presence of extended contacts .",
    "frequent collisions can mimic extended contacts@xcite , and one can construct an effective potential for hard spheres by coarse - graining configurations over time intervals large compared to times between collisions@xcite . in this paper , we discuss signatures of an approaching jam in collisional flows , assuming that a suitable coarse - graining can map these on to flows that develop extended contacts .",
    "the majority of our results are from the intermittent flow regime where we observe clearly defined intervals of slow and fast flows .",
    "in addition , we have studied one jam that lasts for @xmath17 collisions , and characterized the structure of the flow during its creation and breakup .",
    "a permanent jam can not be created in our model of collisional flow since we prevent inelastic collapse@xcite .",
    "to study fluctuations , we construct a velocity field , @xmath18 by coarse graining individual particle velocities @xmath19 over a box of size @xmath20 : @xmath21 where the sum is over the @xmath22 particles whose centers lie inside a box centered at @xmath23 at time @xmath24 .",
    "the entire hopper is subdivided into non - overlapping boxes , starting at the base of the hopper and proceeding vertically upwards .",
    "we employ two different types of averaging to measure fluctuations . a time - averaged flow - field , @xmath25",
    "may be used to measure temporal fluctuations in each box ; and a spatially averaged flow - field , @xmath26 may be used to measure instantaneous variations of the velocity .",
    "both measures are illustrated in figure  [ fig : vfield ] , which shows the spatio - temporal heterogeneity of the velocity field . in most of the analysis",

    "the leftmost panel of figure  [ fig : vfield ] shows the spatial pattern in @xmath28 .",
    "particles enter the hopper at the top and large gradients are seen in the direction of the flow .",
    "this region transitions into the `` bulk '' where @xmath28 is gradient - free in the direction of the flow , but a marked interface with a large gradient separates the bulk flow from the shear layer along the vertical wall .",
    "this bulk flow gives way to a flow with strong gradients , transverse to and along the flow direction , close to the orifice .",
    "the length scales associated with the gradients of @xmath28 are not well understood .",
    "the width of the shear layer has been related to a stress - activated mechanism@xcite , and we are currently investigating the relation between stress fluctuations and velocity gradients in our simulations@xcite .",
    "the center panel of figure  [ fig : vfield ] shows an example of instantaneous variations in the velocity field . tracking the velocities of individual particles , @xmath32 , we label them as fast ( @xmath33 ) and slow ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the snapshot shows large , vertically - extended clusters of fast moving particles , demonstrating non - trivial spatio - temporal correlations in the flow .    the average flow field",
    ", @xmath28 identifies three interesting regions of the flow , if we set aside the region at the top of the hopper where particles are entering . to analyze fluctuations in these regions , we choose three representative boxes : a box at the orifice , a box in the bulk flow region , and one in the shear layer ; these three are shown in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : vfield ] .",
    "in addition , to better characterize the spatial variation of the fluctuations , we study their statistics in boxes along the central vertical column , and a horizontal row running through the bulk flow region . these two cuts span the regions of strong gradients in @xmath28 . the mean flow rate , @xmath31 , is controlled by the size of the hopper opening , and as the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : vfield ] shows , varies linearly with the outlet width .",
    "the approach to jamming is marked by large temporal variations in @xmath35 .",
    "as we show in this section , the timescales associated with velocity fluctuations provide the strongest signal of an incipient jam .",
    "we study the statistics of the temporal fluctuations through the velocity autocorrelation function , @xmath36 . as an example of the behavior of @xmath37 , the upper panel of figure  [ fig : vautocorr ] shows its variation with flow rate in the shear - layer as measured in the box closest to the vertical wall .",
    "if we measure the autocorrelation time by @xmath38 , then @xmath39 in this box increases by a factor of 2 as the outlet size changes from 10 to 4.5 .",
    "the spatial variation of the relaxation times of the velocity fluctuations is represented by the field @xmath40 , which is shown in figure  [ fig : vautocorr ] for the fastest and the slowest flow rates .",
    "the plots are symmetrized about the central vertical line , so there is meaningful information only in half of each plot .",
    "the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : vautocorr ] illustrates the pattern of @xmath41 at an opening of 10.0 .",
    "this fast - flowing ness is characterized by regions of fast relaxation close to the boundary , and increasingly slow relaxations as one moves towards the center of the hopper . at slower flow rates ,",
    "a clear reversal in trend is evident from the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : vautocorr ] . at opening size 4.5 , @xmath41 is longest at the walls , and shortest at the center .",
    "the change in the pattern of relaxation times signals a qualitative change in the behavior of the flow as it approaches jamming , and is the most significant dynamical signature that we have observed in our simulations .",
    "the near - jamming pattern poses a puzzle if we view the ness as a fluid characterized by a granular temperature@xcite .",
    "the kinetic granular temperature is proportional to the variance of the velocity distribution .",
    "as shown in our earlier paper@xcite , and detailed later in table  [ mean_deviation ] , the kinetic temperature increases from the center to the shear layer with a sharp peak very close to the vertical wall .",
    "this trend does not change with flow rate .",
    "near jamming , therefore , velocity fluctuations relax more slowly in regions with higher kinetic temperature .",
    "this behavior is at odds with our intuition , based on thermal fluids , of slower relaxations at lower temperatures . for the fast flows ,",
    "the hopper - ness does show the expected behavior .",
    "we conclude that there is a pre - jamming regime in collisional hopper flows where the ness behaves neither like a fluid nor a solid .",
    "if we _ assume _ that the green - kubo relations@xcite hold for the ness in the hopper , then the autocorrelation time is related to the diffusion constant @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the kinetic temperature and @xmath44 the viscosity .",
    "the viscosity is related to fluctuations in the stress through another green - kubo relation . at the fastest flow rate , we observe that @xmath45 is small at the center and increases towards the boundaries , consistent with the trend in @xmath43 .",
    "the fast - flowing ness thus qualitatively resembles a fluid with temperature gradients .",

    "one possible explanation is an anomalously large viscosity @xmath44 near the boundaries , which just trades one puzzle for another since viscosity should also decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "we do not understand the origin of the slow - relaxation pattern close to jamming .",
    "a reasonable hypothesis is that boundaries frustrate the downward motion of the gravity - driven flow leading to slow relaxations . in future work , we will study stress fluctuations@xcite and their relationship to the velocity fluctuations in order to better understand the pre - jamming ness .",
    "the pattern of relaxation times indicates that jamming is induced by the boundaries and propagates into the bulk .",
    "as the flow slows , we also observe an increasing frequency of events with zero particles at the outlet .",
    "these events are signaled by a peak at zero velocity in the velocity distribution function , seen in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : timetrace ] .",
    "the percentage of these `` zero '' events remains small , varying from 0.14% at opening 10.0 to 0.67% at 4.5 , as might be inferred from the time - trace of the velocity on the upper left side of this figure .",

    "it is well known@xcite that for random processes , autocorrelation functions and first - passage probabilities provide complementary information .    to study the first passage probabilities , we introduce a clipped variable at each box , defined as @xmath48 , which changes sign at the zeroes of a scaled velocity variable @xmath49 .",
    "this scaled velocity is defined for each box as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the standard deviation obtained from the time series , @xmath53 .",
    "we then define @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) as the probability that this function does not change sign during a time interval of length @xmath24 , i.e. retains a value @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and contains no zeroes .",
    "in other words , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) measure the probability that a fluctuation that is faster ( slower ) than the mean , lasts for precisely a time interval @xmath24 .",
    "we examine these processes in the three representative boxes , highlighted in figure [ fig : vfield ] , which represent the different regimes of @xmath58 , and where we also look at the distributions of the velocity and its autocorrelation function .",
    "these distributions , shown in figure  [ fig : firstpassage ] , appear as power laws cutoff by exponentials for all flow rates , and in all the boxes studied .",
    "the cutoff times increase as the flow rate decreases , implying that the average first passage time increases as the flow slows down , whether we are looking at the time characterizing the switch from above to below the mean ( @xmath59 ) , or or from below to above the mean ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "tracking the motion of these particles , there motion is found to bear a striking resemblance to the process of arch formation seen in experiments@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we tracked the time evolution of the velocity field @xmath74 through the formation and dissolution of the jam .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : vorticity ] shows the velocity field at two instants in time leading up to the jam , and clearly demonstrates the increasing vorticity of the flow . comparing the snapshot on the left to the one on the right , which is at a later time",
    ", we see that vortices nucleate at the edges of the hopper , and propagate into the bulk .",
    "we are currently in the process of measuring this behavior systematically@xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , vorticity of self - organized flows such as the hopper flows have not been investigated much nor have they been correlated with jamming .",
    "in contrast , length scales associated with vorticity have been studied in chute flows@xcite , and have been related to jamming and flow in that geometry through a scaling analysis .",
    "our results suggest that vorticity could be related to the dynamical arrest of hopper flows .",
    "the negative velocity events that we observed in the intermittent flow regime can also be related to vortices , but are transient , and unlike the ones in figure  [ fig : vorticity ] , do not have any significant spatial extent .",
    "we have also analyzed the spatial extent of ` slow clusters ' .",
    "we define slow boxes as ones that have , at a given instant , a vertical velocity smaller than half of the average flow rate in the box .",
    "clusters are identified by nearest - neighbor connectivity and then tracked as a function of time .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : vorticity ] shows two snapshots of cluster formation in the time leading up to the jam .",
    "each of these cluster images corresponds to the same instant in time as the vorticity image in the panel immediately above .",
    "the two images on the left demonstrate that there is vorticity associated with the regions where we see large clusters .",
    "the images on the right are closer to the instant of the jam , and the cluster spans nearly the entire region . to obtain quantitative information , we plot cluster area as a function of time both during the formation and the breakup of the jam .",
    "figure  [ fig : jamarea ] shows that formation and breakup of the jam is signaled by a rapid change in cluster area .",
    "this is not surprising and corroborates the picture that a stable arch at the outlet supports the weight of the grains above while large regions of slow flow develop .",
    "scatter plot of the area covered by connected clusters , defined by boxes in which the flow is less than half the average , plotted against time before ( on the left ) and after ( on the right ) the jamming event .",
    "the duration of the jam that separates the two figures is about 24 simulation times . ]",
    "the clusters that are observed during the jamming event are an example of a dynamically generated structure .",
    "similar structures have been seen in experiments@xcite , so we do not think this is an artifact of our simulation . in our collisional model ,",
    "these slow flow regions are nowhere near static , instead , the grains continually undergo collisions .",
    "the clusters retain their identity while their constituents participate in a highly correlated yet rapid dynamics .",
    "our ultimate aim is to understand the dynamical principles that lead to the emergence of these structures , and their stability . in the next phase of this work",
    ", we will investigate the formation and breakup of stable , long - lasting jams by generating many realizations of our simulation at the smallest opening@xcite , and by using molecular dynamics simulations with particles interacting via hertzian contacts@xcite .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the jamming transition in purely collisional 2d hopper flows . in our simulations",
    ", we identify new dynamical signatures of the approach to jamming in this self - regulated flow .",
    "in particular , we analyze features that are strongly influenced by the boundaries , and find a striking change in the nature of the flow as the opening size is reduced .",
    "the spatial distribution of velocity - autocorrelation times shows that , in a pre - jamming regime , the flow has a distinctly heterogeneous character .",
    "there is a glassy layer at the walls , characterized by anomalously slow velocity relaxations , coexisting with a central flowing region .",
    "this is in contrast to higher flow rates , where the flow resembles a thermal fluid with strong spatial gradients .",
    "the flow is strongly intermittent in the pre - jamming regime , with well - defined periods of slow and fast flow . from measurements of first - passage time distributions",
    ", we deduce that velocity fluctuations that dip below the mean persist longer as jamming is approached .",
    "the effect is strongest at the shear layer , where we also see the development of a glassy region .",
    "we also observe marked vorticity in the flow as an extended jam forms and then breaks up .",
    "the vortices nucleate at the corners of the hopper and extend inwards , ultimately causing complete arrest .",
    "the vorticity is spatially correlated with the solid - like regions , suggesting that the slow relaxation of the velocity is related to the vorticity . in our earlier work@xcite",
    ", we saw clear evidence of stress chains in this purely collisional flow .",
    "these stress chains were predominantly anchored on the side walls , and it is plausible that they are being supported by the glassy layer . in future work",
    "we will investigate the mechanism by which the more glassy boundary layer sheds vortices into the free - flowing bulk layer to generate jams .",
    "one question that arises is whether extended contacts are necessary for the onset of jamming ; our results here suggest otherwise",
    ". we will carry out molecular dynamics simulations and compare them to the event - driven results in order to fully answer this question .",
