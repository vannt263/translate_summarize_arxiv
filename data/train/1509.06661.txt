    "quantum critical phenomena have captured general attention due to their unique singular properties observed at low temperature ( @xmath2 ) and near the quantum critical point ( qcp ) which is frequently accompanied by the unconventional superconductivity ( sc ) @xcite . from this perspective ,",
    "@xmath1-electron compound uge@xmath3  is a system with phase diagram comprising coexistence of spin - triplet sc and ferromagnetism ( fm ) @xcite , as well as an abundance of critical points ( cp ) , either of quantum and classical nature @xcite .",

    "( ii ) _ the tricritical point ( tcp ) at the fm to paramagnetic ( pm ) phase transition located at @xmath4  k. additionally , with the applied magnetic field the second order transition line starting from tcp can be followed to @xmath5 where it is expected to terminate in a quantum critical ending point ( qcep ) @xcite . in effect",

    "temperature plane drawn on the basis of the experimental results @xcite.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    such complex magnetic phase diagram with all the above criticalities , both classical and quantum , is particularly challenging in terms of theoretical modeling .",
    "one of the first approaches , based on the single - band model describing tricritical wings , was the work by belitz , et al .",
    "@xcite . however , the microscopic description of the magnetic phase diagram with all the cps including also cep at the metamagnetic transition , as observed in uge@xmath3 , has been missing until our recent works @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the ( two - orbital ) anderson lattice model ( alm ) @xcite , often referred to as the periodic anderson model .",
    "findings for uge@xmath3 ,  both from first principle calculations and experiments are : the quasi - two - dimensional character of the fermi surface @xcite , a uniaxial anisotropy for magnetization @xcite , u  u interatomic distance above the so - called hill limit @xcite , and the paramagnetic moment per u atom different from that expected for either @xmath6 or @xmath7 atomic configurations @xcite .",
    "we show in the following that all of these findings can be coherently explained within our two - orbital model starting with originally localized @xmath1-states and subsequently being strongly hybridized with the conduction ( @xmath8 ) band states on a two dimensional lattice and with the applied magnetic field accounted for by the zeeman term only .",
    "ferromagnetic order in our model arises from effect of competing hybridization and the @xmath1@xmath1 interatomic coulomb repulsion .",
    "the emergence of two distinct ferromagnetic phases is in our model driven by the changing topology of the fermi surface @xcite which in turn is induced by a relative motion of hybridized and spin split subbands with the increasing @xmath1-@xmath8 hybridization .",
    "the results obtained from such picture @xcite qualitatively agree with the majority of uge@xmath3   magnetic and electronic properties , as seen in neutron scattering @xcite , de haas - van alphen oscillations @xcite , and magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "also , a semi - metallic character of the weak fm1 phase is supported by the band - structure calculations @xcite .",
    "a similar idea concerning the emergence of two distinct fm phases in uge@xmath3  was also obtained earlier within the phenomenological picture based on the stoner theory incorporating a two - peak structure of the density of states in a single band @xcite . in brief , our microscopic model extended to the case of @xmath9 @xcite describes well emergence of all cps on the magnetic phase diagram of uge@xmath3   @xcite in the semiquantitative manner @xcite .",
    "here we compare in detail our results with the experimental data , namely predicted second order transition line joining the tcp with the corresponding qcep .",
    "in particular , we determine the influence of the following factors : _ ( i ) _ the total band filling @xmath10 , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the value of the land factor @xmath11 for @xmath1 states , on the position of this second - order line .",
    "the influence of factor ( i ) has the following importance .",
    "for exemplary filling @xmath12 we have shown @xcite that the relative position of the tcp and cep ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ) is the same as that seen in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the important question is whether such a mutual alignment of those two critical points is necessary to achieve a good fit and to what extent the proper curvature of the line joining tcp and qcep is robust with respect to the selected band filling .",
    "the discussion of the dependence on ( ii ) has its justification in the not fully resolved nature of magnetism in heavy - fermion systems in general and uge@xmath3  in particular .",
    "although it is assumed and widely accepted to be fully itinerant @xcite , there is evidence for a partially localized contribution @xcite . in such case",
    ", the influence of the orbital effects and their coupling to the spin should have an influence on @xmath11 value .",
    "we begin with the orbitally nondegenerate anderson - latice model ( alm ) on square lattice and with applied magnetic field accounted for via the zeeman splitting ( i.e. , with the effective field is @xmath13 ) , so that the starting hamiltonian is @xmath14 where the onsite hybridization is of magnitude @xmath15 and the land factor for @xmath1 electrons is @xmath11 ( the free electron value is @xmath16 ) .",
    "the model describes a two - orbital system with the conduction @xmath17 band arising from the nearest ( @xmath18 ) and the second - nearest ( @xmath19 ) neighbor hoppings , and the strong @xmath1@xmath1 coulomb interaction is of magnitude @xmath20 . if it is not stated otherwise , we set @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we also add to the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) the usual term with the chemical potential @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 the model is solved here by means of _ statistically consistent gutzwiller approximation _",
    "( sga ) @xcite .",
    "the method was successfully applied to the number of problems @xcite .",
    "it is characterized with the physical transparency and flexibility , that it could be also incorporated into other methods such as edabi @xcite .",
    "we introduce the gutzwiller projection acting onto uncorrelated wave function @xmath28 in the following manner @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the wave function of the correlated ground state . in effect",
    ", we map many - particle correlated hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) onto an effective single - particle hamiltonian @xmath31 acting on uncorrelated wave function @xmath28 , that , after taking the space fourier transform , is as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the number of the system sites , @xmath35 is the hybridization narrowing factor , and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "necessary constraints for the @xmath1 electron number and their magnetic moment @xcite are incorporated by means of the lagrange multipliers @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . hamiltonian ( [ hsga ] ) can be straightforwardly diagonalized with the resulting four eigenvalues @xmath39 labeled with the spin ( @xmath40 ) and hybridized - band ( @xmath41 ) indices .",
    "for @xmath9 we construct a generalized landau grand - potential functional according to @xmath42\\\\ & + ( \\lambda_{n}^fn_f+\\lambda_{m}^fm_f+ud^2 ) , \\label{5 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] which is next minimized with respect to the set of following parameters assembled to a vector , @xmath43 .",
    "additionally , we adjust self - consistently the chemical potential from the condition of fixing the total number of electrons , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the fermi - dirac function .",
    "finally the ground state energy is defined by , @xmath46 where @xmath47 means that the value of @xmath48 is taken at minimum for the parameters @xmath49 .",
    "we start our analysis with the discussion on the proper assignment of the physical units to the microscopic parameters provided so far in dimensionless units ( i.e. scaled by @xmath50 ) to make the quantitative comparison with the observed uge@xmath3  characteristics .",
    "to do so , we have adjusted them @xcite by matching the relative positions of the two classical cps : tcp and cep at the ferromagnetic transition , as well as attributing the experimentally measured critical temperatures . matching the results in physical units by fixing the position of two critical points we would call a _ strong fitting _ , whereas by fixing the position of just a single of them a _",
    "weak fitting_.    in our previous works @xcite we have found that for the total filling @xmath12 we could coherently and quantitatively describe the uge@xmath3  phase diagram .",
    "although , there is no direct experimental evidence in uge@xmath3  for choosing this particular filling , we have first matched for chosen @xmath10 tcp and cep temperatures according to the experiment @xcite  strong fitting condition , and second , we have verified our prediction obtaining agreement of the second - order transition line joining tcp with qcep @xcite with that measured .",
    "additionally , the comparison has provided among others the estimate of the qcep appearance about @xmath51  t , i.e. , higher than that suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite which is @xmath52  t.    a natural question arises if this test is sensitive to the choice of @xmath10 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the second - order transition line joining tcp and qcep determined for a slightly different total filling than @xmath12 deviates significantly from the trend of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "hence indeed , the comparison is very sensitive to the choice of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , together with equally sensitive adjustment of @xmath53 and @xmath54 with respect to the choice of @xmath10 @xcite , it is unlikely that our excellent agreement for the single value of parameter @xmath10 is fortuitous .    .",

    "[ fig2 ] the ( dashed ) curve predicted by the one of the most successful approaches describing the general tricritical behavior in itinerant magnetic systems @xcite . in that procedure , the necessary inputs are the positions of the two cps , namely tcp and qcep , leading in fact to the _ strong fitting _ , but with different pair of cps .",
    "however , such fitting can be associated with an error as the position of the qcep , in contrast to tcp and cep , is not experimentally determined but only extrapolated to 18  t , following ref .",
    "note that this condition in our modeling is satisfied for the total filling around @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) if we take the extrapolated value of the critical field . in this case , the comparison with results for uge@xmath3  @xcite is worse then e.g. for @xmath12 and the temperature of the cep is much lower than that determined in experiments @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the model employed by us belongs to the class discussed earlier by kirkpatrick and belitz @xcite to reflect the generic tricriticality in the case of metallic magnets .",
    "namely , systems in which the conduction electrons are not a source of the magnetism themselves , but are couple to the magnetically ordered localized electrons in a second band . the origin of the first - order transition at low temperature described within the mean - field theory developed in the refs .",
    "@xcite is based on the effect of the soft fermionic modes coupled to the magnetization fluctuations , and thus differs from our approach . here the mechanism for ferromagnetism is due to the coupling of the conduction electrons with localized @xmath1 states by hybridizing with them and competing with the @xmath56 coulomb interaction .",
    "this competition in the stoner - like manner induces phase transitions associated with the abrupt changes of the fermi surface topology .",
    "the simplest verification of our analysis can be carried out by means of chemical alloying , i.e. , by changing the electron concentration in the system .",
    "however , the lack of known isostructural compounds to uge@xmath3  may be an apparent obstacle for such test .",
    "though , the determination of the tail of the 2nd order line joining tcp and qcep for the field larger than 16 t should provide an insight on the issue whether our model correctly predicts the appearance of qcep around 30 t @xcite .",

    "finally , we provide a brief analysis of the impact of the land factor value for @xmath1 electrons , @xmath11 , i.e. , in the situation when the @xmath58 component of the total spin of the system does not commute with hamiltonian . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the curves for three different values of @xmath11 .",
    "the curve for @xmath59 , is plotted as the reference curve and is based on the results of ref .",
    "value of @xmath11 is not known for uge@xmath3  and generally , for complex compounds is has a tensor character which depends on the magnitude of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "for that reason we restrict our discussion to the comparison when @xmath11 is equal to the free electron value @xmath59 , and subsequently when is lower and higher ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "specifically , the lower value of land factor @xmath60 is motivated by that for the ce - based compounds , where it can be derived for the spin @xmath61 and angular momentum @xmath62 , oriented antiparallel and where , strictly speaking , our model is also generally valid , as long as we do not account for the orbital degeneracy of @xmath1 states of the uranium - based materials . as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , it seems that any value of @xmath63 factor for @xmath1 states which deviates considerably from the free - electron value , provides much worse agreement with experimental data @xcite . in conclusion , due to predominantly itinerant nature of @xmath1 electrons in uge@xmath3  @xcite",
    ", it is very likely that any crystal - field derived multiplet structure is washed out and hence the value @xmath64 should be regarded as realistic value .",
    "nevertheless , the problem of double localized  itinerant nature of @xmath1-electrons @xcite may arise as the system evolves with the increasing temperature , in comparison to the pressure evolution at low temperature studied in detail here .     and hybridization",

    "in the present work we have employed the anderson lattice model @xcite to provide a fairly complete description of the magnetic phase diagram ( p  t  h profiles ) of uge@xmath3including all the criticalities for this compound . in particular , we study the effect of the choice of the total filling on the quality of the fit , based on our model , to the experimental data @xcite concerning the second - order transition line joining the critical points tcp and qcep . we have found that our prediction is very sensitive to the change of @xmath10 , which leads also to a mismatch of critical temperatures of tcp and cep at at the metamagnetic transition as compared to the experiment .",

    "we have also analyzed the effect of the land factor @xmath11 value for @xmath1 electrons . in this case ,",
