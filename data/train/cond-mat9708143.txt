    "<S> we study the volatility of the s&p500 stock index from 1984 to 1996 and find that the volatility distribution can be very well described by a log - normal function . </S>",
    "<S> further , using detrended fluctuation analysis we show that the volatility is power - law correlated with hurst exponent @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the volatility is a measure of the mean fluctuation of a market price over a certain time interval @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the volatility is of practical importance since it quantifies the risk related to assets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unlike price changes that are correlated only on very short time scales @xcite ( a few minutes ) , the absolute values of price changes ( which are closely related to the volatility ) show correlations on time scales up to many years @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the volatility of the s&p 500 index of the new york stock exchange , which represents the stocks of the 500 largest u.s . </S>",
    "<S> companies . </S>",
    "<S> our study is based on a data set over 13 years from january 1984 to december 1996 reported at least every minute ( these data extend by 7 years the data set previously analyzed in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the logarithmic increments    @xmath2    where @xmath3 denotes the index at time @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the time lag ; @xmath6 is the relative price change @xmath7 in the limit @xmath8 . here </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath9min , well above the correlation time of the price increments ; we obtain similar results for other choices of @xmath5 ( larger than the correlation time ) .    over the day </S>",
    "<S> , the market activity shows a strong `` u - shape '' dependence with high activity in the morning and in the afternoon and much lower activity over noon . to remove artificial correlations resulting from this intra - day pattern of the volatility @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the normalized function    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the mean value of @xmath12 at the same time of the day averaged over all days of the data set .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the volatility at a given time by averaging @xmath13 over a time window @xmath14 with some integer @xmath15 ,    @xmath16    figure [ raw ] shows ( a ) the s&p500 index and ( b ) the signal @xmath17 for a long averaging window @xmath18min ( about 1@xmath19month ) . </S>",
    "<S> the volatility fluctuates strongly showing a marked maximum for the 87 crash . </S>",
    "<S> generally periods of high volatility are not independent but tend to `` cluster '' . </S>",
    "<S> this clustering is especially marked around the 87 crash , which is accompanied by precursors ( possibly related to the oscillatory patterns postulated in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> clustering occurs also in other periods ( e.g.  in the second half of 90 ) , while there are extended periods where the volatility remains at a rather low level ( e.g.  the years of 85 and 93 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lognormal]a shows the scaled probability distribution @xmath20 for several values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the data for different averaging windows collapse to one curve . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the scaling form is log - normal , not gaussian . in the limit of very long averaging times </S>",
    "<S> , one expects that @xmath20 becomes gaussian , since the central limit theorem holds also for correlated series @xcite , with a slower convergence than for non - correlated processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the times considered here , however , a log - normal fits the data better than a gaussian , as is evident in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lognormal]b which compares the best log - normal fit with the best gaussian fit for data averaged over a @xmath21min window .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlations found in fig.[raw]b can be accurately quantified by detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis reveals power - law behavior independent of the @xmath1 value chosen ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dfa ] ) with an exponent @xmath0 in agreement with the value found for the absolute price increments @xcite .    to account for the time dependence of the volatility and its correlations , arch @xcite , garch @xcite models and related approaches </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have been developed , which assume that the volatility depends on time and on the past evolution of the index . </S>",
    "<S> it may be worthwhile to test models also for the volatility distribution @xmath20 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that the probability distribution of the s&p500 volatility can be well described by a log - normal function and that the volatility shows power - law correlations with hurst exponent @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the log - normal shape of the distribution is consistent with a multiplicative process @xcite for the volatility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a multiplicative behavior would be surprising , because efficient market theories @xcite assume that the price changes , @xmath6 , are caused by incoming new informations about an asset . </S>",
    "<S> since such information - induced price changes are additive in @xmath6 , they should not give rise to multiplicative behavior of the volatility . </S>"
