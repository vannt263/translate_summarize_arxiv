    "the analytical treatment presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] relies on the assumption that all relevant variables obey gaussian statistics .",

    "one can easily implement the concepts we have developed until now in a monte carlo ( mc ) code , which also allows higher sophistication , like the inclusion of poissonian noise . with this tool one can readily investigate the effects of non - gaussian distributions of the derived quantities ,",
    "the most important of which is the systematic error of the polarization , as it was first pointed out by @xcite .      due to the various noise sources , the vector components @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 are normally distributed , but since @xmath7 is defined as the quadrature sum of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the statistical errors always add in the positive direction , leading to a systematic increase of the estimated polarization degree , thus introducing a bias .",

    "the results of our mc simulations , as plotted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltap ] , are in good agreement with the analytical solution found by @xcite for the same statistical estimator . for comparison ,",

    "in general , the bias effect is present even at reasonably high values of @xmath40 when the polarization is small and @xmath50 and @xmath49 tend to become similar , so that the systematic bias correction is comparable to the random uncertainty of the polarization",
    ". this is better seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] , where we have plotted the ratio @xmath49 over @xmath50 as a function of @xmath63 deduced from our simulations .",
    "as anticipated , for low values of @xmath64 , the ratio between @xmath49 and @xmath50 tends to unity , with some variations among different estimators .",
    "for @xmath653 the bias correction is less than 10% of the expected accuracy , and it is , therefore , negligible .",
    "moreover , above that threshold , all estimators give practically identical results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] we have plotted , for comparison , the function computed by @xcite , who have used a maximum likelihood estimator in order to evaluate the bias . as these authors have shown , this is the best estimator for @xmath660.7 , while for @xmath670.7 the mode , first used by @xcite , should be used .",
    "until now we have assumed that one is able to perfectly subtract the background contribution .",
    "this is most likely the case when one is to perform polarimetric measurements on point - like sources , since in that situation local background subtraction is in most cases straightforward .",
    "we remark that the background , whatever its nature is , must be subtracted before the calculation of normalized stokes parameters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that possible background polarization is _ vectorially _ removed .",
    "if we assume that the object is characterized by @xmath68 and @xmath69 and the background by @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the two polarization fields can be expressed using the stokes vectors defined as @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where we have neglected any circular polarization . since stokes vectors are additive ( see for example",
    "* ) , the resulting polarization field is described by @xmath74 and , therefore , the total polarization is given by the following formula :    @xmath75}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 , i.e. the ratio between the polarized fluxes of background and object .",
    "the corresponding polarization angle is    @xmath77    clearly , the background is going to influence significantly the object when @xmath78 . for @xmath79 one can write :    @xmath80}\\ ] ]    which implies that , for comparable polarized fluxes , the resulting polarization is nulled when the polarization fields are _ perpendicular _ ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "one of the basic problems one has to face when reducing the data produced by dual - beam instruments is the flat - fielding . due to the fact that image splitting occurs after the focal mask , the collimator and the hwp , one would in principle need to obtain flat exposures with all optical components in the light path .",
    "unfortunately , in all practical conditions , this introduces strong artificial effects due to the strong polarization typical of flat - field sources ( either twilight sky or internal screens ) . in principle",
    "one can reduce this effect using the continuous rotation of the hwp as a depolarizer .",
    "this is implemented , for example , in efosc2 , currently mounted at the eso-3.6 m telescope @xcite and it is effective only if the hwp rotation time is much shorter than the required exposure time .",
    "the depolarizing effect can also be achieved by averaging flats taken the same set of hwp angles used for the scientific exposures .",
    "in fact , with the usage of the optimal angle set ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : basics ] ) , one has that    @xmath82    and a similar expression for @xmath83 , which do not contain any polarization information .",
    "the problem is that this is true only if the source is stable in intensity , which is surely not the case for the twilight sky and probably not really true for most lamps .",
    "an alternative solution ( at least for imaging ) is the usage of a set of twilight flats obtained without hwp and wp .",
    "if on the one hand this eliminates source polarization , on the other hand it does not allow for a proper flat field correction .",
    "in fact , while the pixel - to - pixel variations are properly taken into account , the large scale patterns are not , due to the beam split that maps a given focal plane area into two distinct regions of the post - wp optics and detector .",
    "moreover , these calibrations do not carry any information about possible spatial effects introduced by the hwp and the wp .",
    "however , as the simulations show , this problem becomes milder if some redundancy is introduced .",
    "for example , if one uses @xmath19=4 hwp positions , the ordinary and extraordinary ray will just swap when the angle differs by @xmath84 within each of the two redundant pairs ( @xmath85 , see eqs .",
    "[ eq : ord ] ) .",
    "this tends to cancel out the flat - field effect and becomes more efficient if the maximum redundancy ( @xmath19=16 ) is used .",
    "it must be noticed , however , that time dependent effects , like fringing , may affect the redundant pairs in a different way , therefore decreasing the cancellation efficiency .",
    "so far we have assumed that our system is described by eqs .",
    "[ eq : ord ] , i.e. that the wollaston prism splits incoming unpolarized light into identical fractions . a deviation from this ideal behaviour",
    "can be described by the introduction of a new parameter @xmath86 in eqs .",
    "[ eq : ord ] , which can be reformulated as follows :    @xmath87\\\\   & & \\\\ f_{e , i } & = & ( 1-t ) \\left [ i - q\\;\\cos 4\\theta_i - u\\;\\sin 4\\theta _ i\\right ] \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    an ideal system is obtained for @xmath88 .",
    "now , for unpolarized light ( @xmath4=@xmath5=0 ) , these new equations give @xmath89 and @xmath90 for all hwp angles , so that all normalized flux differences turn out to be identical , i.e. @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath86 can be directly estimated observing an unpolarized source .    in the simplest situation , where @xmath19=2 , neglecting the presence of the @xmath86 term would lead to a spurious polarization degree @xmath92 , with a polarization angle @xmath93 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is not the case , for example , when @xmath19=4 .",
    "in that situation , in fact , because all redundant @xmath25 s are identical , eqs .",
    "[ eq : q ] and [ eq : u ] would correctly yield null stokes parameters .",
    "the problem when the incoming light is polarized is more complicated , since the normalized flux differences are not anymore a linear combination of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , as one can verify from eqs .",
    "[ eq : wp ] :    @xmath94    where we have set @xmath95 ( @xmath961 , @xmath97=0 in the ideal case ) .",
    "if @xmath97 is known , one can correct the observed @xmath98 and @xmath99 dividing them by @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively before following the procedure adopted for the ideal case .",
    "of course , if the source has a known polarization ( e.g. a polarized standard ) , one can use this information together with the observed @xmath25 ratios to derive @xmath97 for each hwp angle , according to the following relation :    @xmath102    if the input polarization is unknown , then one can in principle derive @xmath97 from the observations themselves , provided that @xmath1034 .",
    "in fact , after introducing the parameter    @xmath104    and using eqs .",
    "[ eq : kappa ] , it is easy to demonstrate that    @xmath105    where @xmath106 and the positive sign refers to the case @xmath107 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath108 , one can determine two independent estimates of @xmath97 , which can be averaged to improve on the accuracy .",
    "it is interesting to note that , when @xmath109 , eq .",
    "[ eq : kappa ] can be approximated as @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath19 is a multiple of 4 ( i.e. if the @xmath25 function is sampled for an integer number of periods @xmath111 ) , one has that    @xmath112    which clarifies the meaning of the @xmath38 term in the fourier series ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : fourcoeff ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the redundancy on the @xmath25 parameters does eliminate the effects of a non ideal wp to a large extent .",
    "for example , a blind application of eqs .",
    "[ eq : q ] and [ eq : u ] to the case of @xmath19=4 gives the following result :    @xmath113    and a similar expression for @xmath46 .",
    "if the polarization is small ( @xmath114 ) , we have that @xmath115 and therefore the application of the ideal case procedure to a non ideal situation would lead to a value of @xmath45 which is @xmath116 times smaller than the real one . since the same is true for @xmath46 , the resulting polarization @xmath7 will also be @xmath116 times smaller than the input value , while the polarization angle remains unchanged .",
    "for example , if @xmath117 , @xmath118 is less than 4% .",
    "[ eq : wp ] describe a particular case only , where the incoming unpolarized flux is distributed into two fractions @xmath86 and @xmath119 .",
    "more in general , one should replace the term @xmath119 with an independent parameter @xmath120 , so that the fraction of light split by the wp in the ordinary and extraordinary ray become uncorrelated . using the same procedure , it is easy to demonstrate that one can estimate the ratio @xmath121 still using eq .",
    "[ eq : kappa2 ] .",
    "another effect we have investigated is the possibility that the difference in polarization direction between the ordinary and the extraordinary ray of the wp is not @xmath111 .",
    "if we call @xmath122 the deviation from this ideal angle , using the general expression of the mueller matrix for a linear polarizer ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and deriving the expressions for the normalized flux ratios , one gets :    @xmath123 + \\frac{\\bar{u}}{2 } [ \\sin(4\\theta_i-2\\delta\\alpha ) + \\sin 4\\theta_i]\\ ] ]    where the approximation is valid under the assumption that @xmath124 . with the aid of this expression it is easy to conclude that for reasonably small values of @xmath122 ( @xmath12510@xmath126 ) , the implied errors are of the order of 0.05% on the polarization degree and 5@xmath126 on the polarization angle , irrespective of the number of hwp positions used",
    "in the ideal case , the normalized flux differences are modulated by the hwp rotation according to eq .",
    "[ eq : system ] , which is a pure cosinusoid .",
    "if defects are present on the hwp , like dirt or inhomogeneously distributed dust , one can expect spurious flux modulations , which are not related to the polarization of the incoming light and can reduce the performance of the instrument . as a consequence ,",
    "error estimates based on pure photon statistics are systematically smaller than the actual ones .",
    "these kinds of problems can be investigated with the aid of fourier analysis , following the procedure we have outlined at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : basics ] .",
    "this method becomes particularly effective when the observations are taken sampling the full hwp angle range , i.e. 2@xmath127 which , given the choice of the optimal angle set @xmath17=@xmath128 , implies @xmath19=16 retarder plate positions .",
    "in these circumstances , one is able to determine the fourier coefficients @xmath129 and @xmath130 for the first 8 harmonics , the fundamental ( @xmath131 ) being related to local transparency fluctuations which repeat themselves after a full revolution , like dirt or dust . by definition ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq : system ] ) , the fourth harmonic is directly related to the linear polarization , i.e. @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "all other harmonics , with the only remarkable exception of the second one ( @xmath134=2 ) , are simply overtones of harmonics with lower frequencies and include part of the noise generated by the photon statistics , which is present at all frequencies and is therefore indicated as white noise . for this reason , the global random error",
    "is often estimated as the signal carried by the harmonics having @xmath134=3,5 - 8 ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* their appendix  a.3 ) .",
    "the second harmonic deserves a separate discussion .",
    "ideally , the hwp operates as a pure rotator of the input stokes vector , with the advantage that one does not need to rotate the whole instrument in order to analyze different polarization planes . in the real case , being the hwp usually constructed using bi - refringent materials , it is affected by the so - called pleochroism .",
    "this is a wavelength dependent variation of the transmission that takes place when the direction of the incoming light is changed with respect to the crystal lattice . due to the way the hwp is manufactured , the crystals have an axial symmetry , which gives a period of @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , this effect is seen as the @xmath134=2 component .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier ] we show a real case , where we have applied this analysis to archival data obtained with the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph ( hereafter fors1 ) , which is currently mounted at the cassegrain focus of eso - vlt 8.2 m telescope @xcite .    a bright ( and supposedly unpolarized ) star was observed using @xmath19=16 hwp positions .",
    "first of all , the fourier analysis indicates the presence of a small deviation of the wp from the ideal behaviour ( @xmath1354.1@xmath13610@xmath137 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : wollaston ] ) .",
    "then , a clear polarization is detected , at the level of about 0.4% while all other components are smaller than 0.05% ( this polarization is actually an instrumental effect present in fors1 .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : instr ] ) .",
    "the effective significance of harmonics other than @xmath134=4 can be judged on the basis of the expected errors of the fourier coefficients .",
    "for example , using the expression of @xmath129 one finds that    @xmath138    with this kind of analysis , one can see that in the example of fig .  [",
    "fig : fourier ] , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are consistent with a null value for @xmath134=3,5 - 7 ( see the central panel ) . as for the @xmath134=1,2 harmonics , the fourier coefficients are non null at a 2@xmath139 level .",
    "since for the test star it was @xmath1401600 , it is clear that to detect @xmath134=1,2 harmonics of this amplitude ( 0.05% ) , a @xmath1413000 is required .",
    "it is important to notice that the presence of these non - null harmonics is implicitly corrected for when one has a sufficient number of hwp positions covering the maximum period 2@xmath127 . in the most common case , where @xmath19=4 angles spaced by @xmath127/8 are used , one can derive the fundamental ( i.e. linear polarization , period @xmath127/2 ) and the first overtone ( period @xmath127/4 ) only .",
    "the latter corresponds to the @xmath134=8 component of the @xmath19=16 cases , which therefore carries the high frequency information only . as a consequence ,",
    "if other harmonics are present , they are not properly removed and contribute to the final error , practically setting the maximum accuracy one can achieve , irrespective of the snr .",
    "numerical simulations performed assuming a virtually infinite snr show that in the presence of @xmath131 and @xmath142 components , the usage of @xmath19=4 hwp angles leads to systematic errors which are of the same order of the amplitude of the two harmonics . from this and",
    "the example reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier ] , one can estimate that the absolute maximum accuracy reachable with fors1 using @xmath19=4 is of the order of 0.05% .",
    "another typical problem which affects the retarder plates is the chromatic dependence of the angle zero point .",
    "this is usually measured by means of a glan - thompson prism and it can change by more than 5@xmath126 across the optical wavelength range . the computed polarization angle can be corrected simply adding the hwp angle offset for the relevant wavelength ( or effective wavelength in the case of broad band imaging ) .",

    "typically the analyzer is followed by additional optics , like filters , grisms and camera lenses which , due to their possible tilt with respect to the optical axis , may behave as poor linear polarizers . in the most probable case where the polarization is produced by transmission ( see also next section ) , the properties of post - analyzer ( pa ) components can be described by the following approximate mueller matrix :    @xmath150    where @xmath1511 , @xmath1521 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 is the polarization angle ( which can change across the field of view ) while @xmath1 is related to the polarization degree introduced by the pa optics .",
    "this expression can be deduced from the general formulation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "4.63 ) after applying the usual matrix rotation ( see for example * ? ? ?",

    "[ eq : a0 ] .",

    "[ fig : fourier ] , can actually be attributed to both kinds of problems .",

    "the polarization degree deduced using @xmath19=2 ( central panels ) is markedly different from that derived with @xmath19=4 ( upper panels ) and the deviation is particularly severe for the unpolarized object . as one can finally notice , the resulting values of @xmath166 show a strong wavelength dependency and are higher than 5% at about 800 nm .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath1670 at about 450 nm , i.e. at the wavelength where the anti - reflection coatings are optimized ( see next section ) .",

    "fig : fourier ] ) , strongly suggest that the effect seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : postanal ] is indeed produced by the tilted surfaces of the grism .",
    "so far , we have assumed that all optics preceding the analyzer do not introduce any polarization .",
    "of course , this is not generally true ( see for example * ? ? ? * and leroy 2000 for a general introduction to the subject ) .    to show the effect of instrumental polarization , we assume that the pre - analyzer optics , which include telescope mirrors , collimator , hwp and so on , introduce an artificial polarization , which depends on the position in the field . for the sake of simplicity , we assume these optics act as a non - perfect linear polarizer , characterized by a position dependent polarization degree @xmath168 and polarization angle @xmath169 .",
    "this can be described by the following mueller matrix :    @xmath170    where we have neglected circular polarization and we have set @xmath171 and @xmath153 . for @xmath172=0 one obtains a totally transparent component , while @xmath172=1 gives an ideal linear polarizer .",
    "if @xmath173 is the stokes vector describing the input polarization state , it will be transformed by pre - analyzer optics into the vector @xmath174 before entering the analyzer :    @xmath175    and , therefore , the measurements would lead to @xmath176 which would then need to be corrected for the instrumental effect inverting eqs .",

    "it is important to notice that the main difference between instrumental polarization and a polarized background is that the latter is effective only when @xmath188 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] ) , while the former acts regardless of the object intensity and what counts is its polarization .    with the aid of these approximate expressions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : approx ] ) , one can easily evaluate the instrumental polarization , provided that the input polarization field is known and the observed source covers a large fraction of the instrument field of view .",
    "in fact , solving eqs .",
    "[ eq : approx ] for @xmath155 and @xmath172 yields :    @xmath189    and    @xmath190    where @xmath191 and @xmath192 are two independent estimates of @xmath172 , that can be averaged to increase the accuracy .",
    "as it is well known , the night sky shows a polarization which varies according to the ecliptic and galactic coordinates ( see * ? ? ? * for an extensive review ) .",
    "it is mostly dominated by the zodiacal light polarization , which reaches its minimum , below a few percent , at the anti solar position @xcite .",
    "since this is not expected to vary on the scales of a few arcminutes , in principle , relatively empty fields represent suitable targets for panoramic polarization tests , provided that the signal - to - noise ratio per spatial resolution element is of the order of several thousands .",
    "to show an example application , we have performed a test using real data obtained with fors1 at the eso - vlt . in this instrument , the polarimetric mode is achieved inserting in the beam a super - achromatic hwp and a wp , which has a throw of about 22@xmath193 @xcite .",
    "we have identified in the eso archive three sets of data obtained in rather empty fields in @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 passbands .",
    "equatorial coordinates ( @xmath163 , @xmath164 ) , ecliptic longitude and latitude ( @xmath194 , @xmath195 ) , helio - ecliptic longitude ( @xmath196 ) , sky polarization degree and angle ( @xmath197 , @xmath198 ) are reported in table  [ tab : empty ] for the different fields . in all three cases the signal - to - noise ratio achieved on the sky background @xmath199 in the combined images",

    "[ eq : sigp ] , is of the order of 0.3% , while the uncertainty of @xmath8 is about 9@xmath126 ( see eq .  [ eq : sigchi ] ) . in order to further increase the accuracy and to allow for outlier rejection",

    ".[tab : empty ] data for the empty fields [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since the instrumental polarization on the optical axis , measured with unpolarized standard stars , is smaller than 0.03% @xcite , one can be confident that the sky background polarization field ( @xmath202 ) measured close to that area is not affected by spurious effects ( the values are reported in the last two columns of table  [ tab : empty ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can easily compute @xmath168 and @xmath169 using the method previously outlined , where @xmath203=@xmath199 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",

    "the instrumental polarization of fors1 shows a quasi - symmetric radial pattern .",

    "the deviation from a perfect central symmetry is distinctly shown by the dispersion of the points , which is larger than the measurement error .",
    "particularly marked is the case of the @xmath1 band , which shows a strong azimuthal dependence and deserves a separate discussion ( see next section ) . for the @xmath6 band",
    "there is a systematic deviation from central symmetry for a polar angle @xmath207 between 10@xmath126 and 80@xmath126 .",

    "the @xmath3 band shows the smoothest behaviour and the observations are described very well by the following polynomial :    @xmath209    the absolute rms deviations shown by the data from the best fits are of the order of 0.05% , so that in these two passbands the spurious polarization can be corrected with an accuracy which is comparable to that dictated by the photon statistics . in both cases , but especially in the @xmath3 band , the pattern is remarkably radial , as shown in the lower panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : radprofv ] and [ fig : radprofi ] , where we have plotted @xmath155 as a function of polar angle @xmath163 .    in order to verify these results for the @xmath6 filter ,",
    "we have carried out a test observing an unpolarized standard star placed in the lower right corner of the detector .",
    "measured polarization was @xmath7=0.92@xmath2100.04% and @xmath8=@xmath16548@xmath2111@xmath126.4 while , according to the previous analysis , the expected instrumental polarization in that position is @xmath172=0.96% and @xmath21251@xmath126.9 , which are in very good agreement with each other ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : insmapv ] , lower right corner ) .",
    "once the instrumental polarization is mapped , one can correct for it using the approximate eqs .",
    "[ eq : approx ] , which hold when @xmath172 and @xmath48 are small and only if the instrumental polarization is produced by a linear polarizer preceding the analyzer .",
    "as we have seen , the spurious polarization detected in fors1 in @xmath6 and @xmath3 passbands has a clear central symmetry , it is null on the optical axis @xcite , shows a radial pattern and grows with the distance from the optical axis .",
    "all these facts suggest that this must be generated by the optics which precede the analyzer , i.e. within the collimator .",
    "in fact , when a light beam enters an optical interface along a non - normal direction , the component of the transmitted beam perpendicular to the plane of incidence is attenuated , according to fresnel equations ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , the emerging beam is linearly polarized in a direction which is parallel to the plane of incidence .",
    "if the surface is curved , as it is the case of lenses , the incidence angle quickly increases moving away from the optical axis and this , in turn , produces an increase in the induced polarization . the effect becomes more pronounced if the lens is strongly curved , i.e. if the curvature radius is comparable to its diameter .",
    "of course , on the optical axis , the incidence angle is null , so that no polarization is produced .",
    "therefore , at least from a qualitative point of view , the polarization induced by transmission has all the required features to explain the observed pattern .",
    "the polarization induced by transmission can be easily evaluated using the appropriate expression for the corresponding mueller matrix ( see * ? ? ?",
    "4.63 ) . for a typical refraction index @xmath213=1.5 and an incidence angle of 30@xmath126 , refraction through an uncoated glass would produce a polarization of about @xmath1=1.7 % _ per optical surface_. this polarization",
    "is usually reduced in a drastic way ( i.e. down to 0.1 - 0.2% ) by anti - reflection ( ar ) coatings . nevertheless ,",
    "since the effect of multiple surfaces is roughly additive , in the presence of numerous and pretty curved lenses , residual polarization can be non negligible .",
    "another important aspect is that this mechanism has no effect on circular polarization , in agreement with the fact that no instrumental circular polarization has been measured in fors1 @xcite .",
    "we have run polarization ray - tracing simulations , including telescope mirrors , collimator lenses and ar coatings .",
    "this kind of calculation allows one to describe in detail the optical system , taking into account partial polarization cancellation produced by symmetries within the optical beams and the depolarizing effect of ar coatings .",
    "the standard resolution collimator of fors1 contains 3 lenses and a doublet , all treated with a single - layer mgf@xmath214 quarter - wave ar coating at 450 nm @xcite .",
    "the ray - tracing calculations @xcite show that indeed the polarization induced by transmission is not totally removed by the ar coatings . for @xmath6 and @xmath3 filters , a best fit to the simulated data",
    "gives a radial dependence which is very similar to the results we have derived from the experimental data .",
    "the deviation is maximum at the edges of the field of view , where the ray - tracing model gives a polarization which is @xmath00.08% and @xmath00.05% smaller than what is actually observed in @xmath6 and @xmath3 respectively ( see also figs .  [",
    "fig : radprofv ] and  [ fig : radprofi ] , upper panel , thin curves ) .",
    "possible explanations for this small discrepancy are to be identified with imperfections in the ar coatings and with the effects of non - orthogonal incidence on the hwp .    in principle , since single - layer ar coatings are optimized for one specific wavelength ( 450 nm in the case of fors1 ) , the residual polarization is expected to be higher at other wavelengths .",
    "simulations have been run in order to sample the wavelength range 400 - 900 nm and they show that the expected wavelength dependency can be very well approximated by the following linear relation :    @xmath215    where @xmath194 is expressed in nm .",
    "this relation predicts pretty accurately the @xmath040% relative increase we indeed see passing from @xmath6 to the @xmath3 passband and can , thus , be safely used to predict the effect in the @xmath216 band .",
    "according to the simulations , one would expect that the spurious polarization in @xmath1 is about 25% smaller than in @xmath6 .",
    "but , as we have already mentioned , this passband shows a rather weird behaviour and does not conform to the model predictions .",
    "in fact , the polarization pattern strongly deviates from central symmetry , displaying a marked azimuthal dependence ( fig .  [",
    "fig : insmapb ] , left panel ) .",
    "this becomes more evident looking at the radial profile presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : radprofb ] ( upper panel ) : the purely radial dependence is clearly disturbed by an asymmetric field . in some directions the polarization field grows much faster than in others , producing a great spread in the observed data and , in most of the cases , the observed polarization is larger than what is predicted by the polarization ray - tracing ( thin solid curve ) .",
    "the deviations from a centrally symmetric pattern reach up to 0.5% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : residb ] ) , making the correction in the @xmath1 band quite difficult , and certainly not feasible using simple smooth functions as in the cases of @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "rather , a much more accurate correction can be obtained by interpolating the map of fig .",
    "[ fig : insmapb ] at the required field position .",
    "we must remark , however , that a rigorous correction for this secondary effect will be possible only once its physical reason is identified and its mathematical description is formulated .",
    "we have tried to reproduce the observed behaviour introducing defects in the system , like a weak linear polarization from the hwp and the presence of linear polarization in the post analyzer optics . in both cases the effect is completely different from what we see in the @xmath1 band . therefore , the physical reason of this phenomenon is still unclear ( see also the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "what we can say here is that the deviation from central symmetry is present , though to a much smaller extent , also in the @xmath6 band .",
    "this is shown by the contours at constant polarization , which are clearly box - shaped ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : insmapv ] ) , while in the @xmath3 band they are practically circular ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : insmapi ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is that this additional effect , whatever its origin is , becomes more severe at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we must notice that our method heavily relies on the assumptions that the instrumental polarization is null on the optical axis and the sky background polarization is constant across the field of view .",
    "as a matter of fact , the night sky polarization is not very well studied .",
    "the only extensive analysis we could find in the literature is the one by @xcite , who concluded that the polarization structure varies in scale from a few degrees to about 30@xmath126 , i.e. on scales which are much larger than the field of view of fors1 ( 68 @xmath136 68 ) . in order to explain the deviations we observe from a centrally symmetric pattern",
    ", one would need a variation in the sky polarization of the order 0.5% on a scale of a few arcmin .",
    "even though this seems to be quite a large gradient , in principle we can not exclude it .",
    "only further tests will clarify the nature of the effect we see in the @xmath1 band .",
    "dual - beam polarizers coupled to 2d arrays provide a tool to perform panoramic imaging polarimetry and multi - object spectro - polarimetry . in these instruments ,",
    "the atmospheric fluctuations problem is solved by obtaining simultaneous measurements of two orthogonal polarization states .",
    "of course , the use of a wp has also some drawbacks , as the flat - fielding issue discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : flat ] . with the only exception of this feature , data reduction and analysis are totally similar to other polarimetric systems , as we have shown with both analytical and numerical approaches ( secs .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] and [ sec : mc ] ) .",
    "when the targets to be studied are extended and cover a large fraction of the field - of - view , accurate background subtraction becomes an issue , whose effects we have investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] .",
    "this is particularly important when the background is not the simple sky background , but it has a complicated structure .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for a faint supernova projected onto a galactic spiral arm .",
    "another problem that may reduce the performance of a dual - beam polarimeter is the imperfect behaviour of the wp . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wollaston ] we have discussed this issue and presented a test to determine possible deviations from the ideal case . as an example , we have applied it to the fors1 archive data we have described in sec .  [ sec : instr ] . using an object - free region",

    "[ sec : hwp ] ) .",
    "as we have shown , the redundancy introduced by having @xmath217 strongly reduces this problem , even in the cases where @xmath86 differs by about 10% from the ideal case ( @xmath86=0.5 ) .",
    "this is the case also for the presence of linear polarization in the post - analyzer optics , whose effects are practically eliminated by the redundancy ( sec .",
    "[ sec : postwp ] ) .",
    "finally , we have addressed the instrumental polarization issue , described its consequences and proposed an easy test to detect any spurious effect with rather high accuracy ( sec .",
    "[ sec : instr ] ) . as an example , we have applied it to archival fors1 data and we have detected an instrumental polarization pattern , roughly centrally symmetric ( for @xmath6 and @xmath3 ) and with a radial dependency .",
    "the presence of this spurious polarization affects all objects placed at distances larger than 15 from the optical axis with intrinsic polarizations of a few percent or less .",
    "the problem becomes particularly severe when @xmath218 : in that case the measured stokes parameters can be severely wrong . for objects filling most of the field of view , there always will be regions affected by this problem .",
    "moreover , the correct sky background estimate , which is absolutely necessary to recover the intrinsic object field in the outer parts of the galaxy , becomes impossible , if the instrumental polarization is not taken care of properly .",
    "the spurious field must be removed before one is able to estimate the background contribution .",
    "both our data and ray - tracing simulations show that the effect is wavelength dependent . in the case of fors1 ,",
    "a strong deviation from central symmetry is seen in the @xmath1 band and we have interpreted this as a signature of an additional effect , yet to be explained , not included in the ray - tracing simulations that , in contrast , reproduce quite well the observed data in @xmath6 and @xmath3 .    one possible source of asymmetric instrumental polarization is the unrelieved stress birefringence in the optical glasses , due to thermal strain and mechanical loading ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "this phenomenon is known to introduce a retardance which , in turn , can change the polarization status of incoming polarized light ( the effect is null if the light is unpolarized ) . since the incoming radiation is certainly polarized by fors1 in a differential way across the field of view",
    ", this would also imply that the secondary effect should be weaker where the centrally symmetric component is smaller .",
    "the fact that this is indeed the case ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : residb ] ) and also that the retardance is expected to grow faster than @xmath219 seem to suggest that this is a plausible explanation for the asymmetric component .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then it is not possible to correct the measured linear polarization just subtracting vectorially the residual field ( like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : residb ] ) simply because the effect of retardance depends on the polarization state of the incoming light .",
    "this requires a more sophisticated treatment , necessarily based on the exact knowledge of the physical mechanism and its mathematical description through mueller matrices formalism",
    ".    in general , instrumental polarization induced by transmission is most likely common to all focal reducers equipped with a polarimetric mode .",

    "<S> in this paper we present an error analysis for polarimetric data obtained with dual - beam instruments . </S>",
    "<S> after recalling the basic concepts , we introduce the analytical expressions for the uncertainties of polarization degree and angle . </S>",
    "<S> these are then compared with the results of monte - carlo simulations , which are also used to briefly discuss the statistical bias . </S>",
    "<S> then we approach the problem of background subtraction and the errors introduced by a non - perfect wollaston prism , flat - fielding and retarder plate defects . </S>",
    "<S> we finally investigate the effects of instrumental polarization and we propose a simple test to detect and characterize it . </S>",
    "<S> the application of this method to real vlt - fors1 data has shown the presence of a spurious polarization , which is of the order of @xmath01.5% at the edges of the field of view . </S>",
    "<S> the cause of this effect has been identified with the presence of rather curved lenses in the collimator , combined with the non complete removal of reflections by the coatings . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is probably common to all focal - reducer instruments equipped with a polarimetric mode . </S>",
    "<S> an additional spurious and asymmetric polarization field , whose cause is still unclear , is visible in the @xmath1 band . </S>"
