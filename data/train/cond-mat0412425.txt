    "a decade of advances in microfabrication technology has pushed the typical length scales of electromechanical systems to the limit , where quantum mechanical effects of the mechanical motion must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "such nano - electromechanical systems ( nems ) exhibit a strong interplay between mechanical and electronic ( or magnetic ) degrees of freedom , and their electronic transport properties reflect this interplay in an intricate manner .",
    "a modern trend in transport studies of mesoscopic systems has been to not only consider the current - voltage characteristics of a given device , but also to examine the noise properties , or even the higher cumulants ( _ i.e. _ the full counting statistics ( fcs ) ) of the current distribution @xcite .",
    "the current noise , either its zero - frequency component or the whole frequency spectrum , provides more information than just the mean current and can be used to discern among different possible mechanisms resulting in the same mean current .",
    "while the noise spectra in generic mesoscopic systems have been studied well over a decade , it is only very recently that the study of noise spectra of nems has been initiated @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned three studies deal with the noise spectra of a classical shuttle , a classical nanomechanical resonator coupled to a single electron transistor ( set ) , and the c@xmath1-set in a strong electromechanical coupling regime , respectively .",
    "the first two studies @xcite found peaks in the current noise spectra at the first two multiples of the mechanical frequency . for low bias voltages and strong electromechnical coupling the third study @xcite found a power - law frequency dependence of the noise spectrum attributed to scale - free avalanche charge transfer processes .",
    "in all three cases the noise spectra revealed interesting details about the systems . from the technical point of view , two of the studies @xcite used monte carlo simulations , whereas @xcite used a model - specific numerical evaluation of the macdonald formula ( see below ) .    in this work",
    ", we present a study of the full frequency spectrum of the current noise of a quantum shuttle @xcite .",
    "we extend the general formalism developed for the zero - frequency noise @xcite and the fcs @xcite calculations for nems described by a markovian generalized master equation .",
    "the presented formalism applies not only to the shuttle studied here but could equally well be used for all three systems from the previous studies @xcite for the determination of the noise spectra .",
    "we apply the developed theory to compute numerically the noise spectrum of the shuttle in the deep quantum regime , where @xmath2 is the tunneling length ( see also eq.([eq_ngme ] ) ) and @xmath3 sets the length scale for the quantum mechanical zero - point motion . ] as function of the damping coefficient .",
    "the spectrum has peaks at integer multiples of the slightly _ renormalized _ mechanical frequency .",
    "the renormalization of the bare oscillator frequency as read off from the current spectrum explains a small but observable deviation from the expected value of the current in the shuttling regime @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that it is the renormalized oscillator frequency @xmath5 which should enter this relation . finally , we focus on the low - frequency part of the spectrum when approaching the semi - classical regime for intermediate values of the damping , _",
    "i.e. _ in the coexistence regime , where both shuttling and tunneling are effective .",
    "we use the frequency dependence of the spectrum for @xmath6 to identify additional qualitative evidence for the bistable behavior of the shuttle in this regime described by a simple analytical theory of a slow switching between two current channels ( compare with refs.@xcite ) .",
    "we consider the model of a quantum shuttle described in @xcite .",
    "the shuttle consists of a mechanically oscillating nanoscale grain situated between two leads ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_setup ] ) . in the strong coulomb blockade regime",
    "the grain can be treated as having a single electronic level only .",
    "a high bias between the leads drives electrons through the grain and exerts an electrostatic force on the grain , when charged .",
    "the grain is assumed to move in a harmonic potential , and the oscillations of the grain are treated fully quantum mechanically .",
    "damping of the oscillations is described by interactions with a surrounding heat bath .        from the hamiltonian of the model one can derive a generalized master equation ( gme ) resolved with respect to the number of electrons @xmath7 that have been collected in the right lead during the time span @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
