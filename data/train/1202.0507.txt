    "gravitino productions in association with a susy particle are known processes which become significant at colliders when the gravitino is very light as @xmath0(@xmath1  ev ) or less , since the cross sections are inversely proportional to the square of the planck scale times the gravitino mass @xmath2 when the associated susy particle is the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) and promptly decays into a sm particle and a lsp gravitino , the production processes lead to particular collider signatures , e.g. @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where the missing energy is carried away by two gravitinos , and these signals set mass bounds on the gravitino and the other susy particles .",
    "it should be noted that the gravitino mass is related to the susy breaking scale as well as the planck scale like @xmath5 the current experimental bound on the gravitino mass from the single - photon plus missing - energy signal in neutralino - gravitino associated productions is given by the lep experiment as a function of the neutralino and selectron masses , e.g. @xmath6 for @xmath7 gev and @xmath8 gev  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies on the @xmath9-@xmath10 productions in @xmath11 collisions had been done before especially for the lep  @xcite , and recently the process was restudied for future linear colliders with the then current simulation tools  @xcite in ref .",
    "we note that such a very light gravitino is suggested by the context of no - scale supergravity  @xcite and some extra - dimensional models  @xcite , while in typical gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) scenarios we expect a mass of 1  ev10  kev  @xcite .    in this report",

    "multiple goldstino models , so - called _ goldstini _ models  @xcite , in the framework of gauge mediation are characterized by a visible sector ( e.g.  the mssm ) coupled by gauge interactions to more than one susy breaking sector  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum consists of a light gravitino lsp , behaving as a goldstino , and a number of neutral fermions ( the pseudo - goldstini ) with a mass between that of the lsp and that of the lightest observable - sector susy particle ( losp ) .",
    "here we consider a situation where the losp is the lightest neutralino and there is only one pseudo - goldstino with a mass of @xmath13  gev .",
    "the coupling of the mssm particles to the pseudo - goldstino can be enhanced with respect to those of the gravitino giving rise to characteristic signatures .",

    "the minimal cuts for the detection of photons @xmath40 and the @xmath41-peak cut to remove the sm @xmath42 background @xmath43 are imposed . the most significant background coming from the @xmath30-channel @xmath44-exchange process can be reduced by using polarized @xmath45 beams , while the distributions do not change so much both for signal and background ; see more quantitative details in  @xcite .",
    "the energy distributions are flat , and the maximal and minimal energy are given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the higher edge can determine the pseudo - goldstino mass when the @xmath50 decay is significant .",
    "on the other hand , the angular distributions are not sensitive to the pseudo - goldstino mass , and hence only the @xmath19 case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photon ] ( right ) .",
    "instead the distributions depend on the coupling factors @xmath22 and @xmath37 .",
    "this is because that the distributions are determined by how much the @xmath53-channel and @xmath54-channel diagrams contribute .",
    "the selectron - exchange contribution can be enhanced by increasing @xmath37 as well as @xmath55 , which lead to the flatter distributions ; see more details on the @xmath55 dependence in  @xcite .",
