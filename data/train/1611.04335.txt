    "<S> we consider a chain of atoms that are bound together by a harmonic force . </S>",
    "<S> spin-1/2 electrons that move between neighboring chain sites ( hckel model ) induce a lattice dimerization at half band filling ( peierls effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> we supplement the hckel model with a local hubbard interaction and a long - range ohno potential , and calculate the average bond - length , dimerization , and optical phonon frequencies for finite straight and zig - zag chains using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method . </S>",
    "<S> we check our numerical approach against analytic results for the hckel model . </S>",
    "<S> the hubbard interaction mildly affects the average bond length but substantially enhances the dimerization and increases the optical phonon frequencies whereas , for moderate coulomb parameters , the long - range ohno interaction plays no role . </S>"
