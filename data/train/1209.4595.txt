    "the study of di - boson production processes at the lhc is important both to test the standard model  ( sm ) and because they constitute relevant backgrounds to the beyond standard physics ( bsm ) searches .",
    "they are for example sensitive to tri - linear gauge couplings  ( tgc ) fixed by the underlying electroweak gauge group in the sm .",
    "any deviation in the values observed at experiments would indicate new physics effects . in particular , wz production measurements  @xcite are relevant to constrain the wwz   tri - linear coupling and to search for charged heavy bosons from bsm sector via jacobian peaks  @xcite .    to match the experimental accuracy , precise and reliable predictions beyond the leading order approximation",
    "are required .",
    "the next - to - leading order  ( nlo ) qcd corrections for wz production were computed in  @xcite and turned out to be sizable .",
    "these large corrections are a well known fact for colorless production channels . at nlo qcd ,",
    "new topologies and new partonic sub - processes appear , fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , e.g. those with a w or z emitted from a jet or an initial - state parton .",
    "these new configurations can have partonic luminosities ( e.g. @xmath1 ) that are enhanced over those present at lo ( e.g. @xmath2 ) , which can lead to large corrections in differential distributions .",
    "they also permit soft or collinear bosons emissions from a quark which results in @xmath3 enhancement for a number of observables .",
    "lo        nlo        nnlo        at the next - to - next - to - leading order  ( nnlo ) further new sub - processes and topologies , including those with soft and collinear bosons , start to contribute , fig .  [ fig : diagram ] , which might also lead to large corrections in some regions of phase space .",
    "therefore , using only the nlo results to compute the wz backgrounds may lead to a misinterpretation of a possible excess observed in data , which could be wrongly attributed to new physics .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to try to assess the genuine nnlo qcd contributions for this process .",
    "the current state of the art is that the virtual two - loop corrections for wz production are unknown .",
    "however , recently , the nlo qcd corrections for wz+jet were computed in  @xcite , including anomalous couplings  @xcite , and they are available in the vbfnlo package  @xcite .",
    "this result provides the mixed real - virtual and the double real @xmath4 contributions to the wz production including the nlo corrections to the @xmath1 channel .",
    "this opens the possibility to merge the results for wz@nlo and wzj@nlo and obtain the part of the nnlo result for wz production that is associated with channels absent at lo , which is the dominant contribution for a range of differential distributions at high @xmath5 .",
    "this can be done in a consistent way by employing the loopsim method  @xcite which uses unitarity to cancel infrared and collinear divergences that arise when one adds tree level results with different multiplicities .",
    "the loopsim prescription is general and it has been found to work well for z+jet and drell - yan production , especially for observables which receive significant corrections at nlo  @xcite .",
    "the method supplements a set of real and real - virtual diagrams with approximate contributions from loop diagrams .",
    "the result at a given order is denoted with @xmath6 to distinguish it from the exact result .    in this paper , we compute the @xmath7corrections ( according to the notation introduced above ) to wz production at the lhc @xmath8 including the leptonic decays and full off - shell and finite width effects .",
    "we organize this paper as follows : in section  [ sec : caldetails ] , we give technical details of our computation including a short description of the loopsim method . in section  [ sec : numres ] , we present numerical results and the impact of the @xmath7qcd corrections on various differential distributions . in section  [ sec : concl ] , we summarize our findings .",
    "for the calculation of wz@@xmath7 , we used the implementations of wz@nlo and wzj@nlo from the vbfnlo package  @xcite , with the latter providing the double - real and the real - virtual parts of the nnlo result .",
    "then the missing two - loop contributions are approximated by loopsim from the tree - level and one - loop parts of wzj@nlo . to allow for communication between vbfnlo and loopsim , we developed an interface between the two programs .",
    "on one hand , it consists of an extension of vbfnlo which enables it to write events in the les houches ( lh ) format at nlo and , on the other hand , of a class which reads the les houches events and passes them to loopsim",
    ". then loopsim assigns an approximate angular - ordered branching structure to each lh event , with the help of the cambridge / aaachen ( c / a )  @xcite jet algorithm . by default",
    ", it uses a radius @xmath9 and by varying @xmath10 , one probes one class of uncertainty of the method . as we shall see in the next section , except for the very low @xmath5 region , this uncertainty is significantly smaller than that coming from renormalization and factorization scale variation .    the error that we make for an observable ( a ) is a finite constant associated with the lo topology and it is free of infrared and collinear divergences since these are , by construction , suitably treated by loopsim .",
    "this implies @xmath11 thus , differential distributions sensitive to new channels and new kinematically enhanced configurations resulting in large nlo k - factors , should be close to the full nnlo result , providing predictions more precise than the pure nlo corrections to wz .",
    ") , for the lhc at @xmath12 .",
    "the bands correspond to varying @xmath13 by factors 1/2 and 2 around the central value from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ren ] ) .",
    "the cyan solid bands give the uncertainty related to the @xmath10 parameter varied between 0.5 and 1.5 .",
    "the distribution is a sum of contributions from two unlike flavor decay channels , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . ]",
    "[ t ! ]      [ t ! ]      in our computations , regardless of the order , we use the mstw nnlo 2008  @xcite pdfs with @xmath16 .",
    "we choose @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 as electroweak input parameters and derive the weak mixing angle from the standard model tree level relations .",
    "the center - of - mass energy is fixed to @xmath20 if not specified otherwise . as in the underlying vbfnlo wz@nlo and wzj@nlo calculations ,",
    "only the channels with w and z/@xmath21 decaying into unlike flavor leptons are considered , i.e. @xmath22 . from the theoretical perspective , to take into account all possible decay channels , i.e. @xmath23 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath24 , one can safely multiply the single flavor result by a factor four , since the fermi interferences due to identical particles in the final state are below per mille level  @xcite .",
    "however , as explained later , we shall only apply a cut on the reconstructed mass of the opposite charge same flavor lepton pair .",
    "therefore , all the results shown in figs .  [ fig : ht][fig : ptnu ] correspond to the sum of contributions from the two decay channels , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "all off - shell effects are included , which takes into account spin correlations and also virtual photons .",
    "finite width effects , related to leptonic decays of the electroweak gauge bosons , are accounted for with a fixed - width scheme  @xcite .",
    "top quark effects are not considered and all other quarks are taken massless .",
    "effects from generation mixing are neglected since the ckm matrix is set to the identity matrix . as the central value for the factorization and renormalization scales",
    "we choose @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 have to be understood as the reconstructed transverse momenta and invariant masses of the decaying bosons . to study the impact of the qcd corrections , we choose inclusive cuts .",
    "the charged leptons are required to be hard and central : @xmath28 , for @xmath29 coming from z(w ) , and @xmath30 .",
    "the missing transverse energy must satisfy the cut @xmath31 .",
    "the reconstructed mass from the opposite - charge same - flavor leptons has to lie in the window @xmath32 , which also avoids singularities coming from off - shell photons , @xmath33 .",
    "we cluster all final state partons with @xmath34 to jets with the anti-@xmath35 algorithm  @xcite , as implemented in fastjet  @xcite , with the radius @xmath36 . for observables that involve jets , we consider only those jets that lie in the rapidity range @xmath37 and have transverse momenta @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , we impose a requirement on the lepton - lepton and lepton - jet separation in the azimuthal angle - rapidity plane @xmath39 .    as a first check of our setup",
    ", we have merged wz@lo and wzj@lo to produce wz@@xmath7 , which can be tested against the full wz@nlo result . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ht ] , we show the effective mass defined by @xmath40 which often enters in super - symmetry searches  @xcite .",
    "this distribution is very sensitive to the enhancements from soft or collinear emissions of the electroweak bosons as well as to additional parton radiation coming from new channels .    in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ht ] , we show the k factors with respect to the lo result and , in the bottom , the corresponding ratios to nlo . at low @xmath41 values ,",
    "the difference between @xmath7and nlo is at the level of 30@xmath42 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we do not have control over the finite virtual constant terms which are missing in our @xmath7approximation .",
    "however , as the @xmath41 increases , the @xmath7result converges to the full nlo , providing a prediction more accurate than a simple lo calculation .",
    "note in the middle panel the large @xmath43 corrections and fast convergence to the nlo result , yielding k - factors of order of 10 .",
    "the @xmath44 corrections can be as large as 100@xmath45 compared to nlo ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ht ] ) and they are clearly beyond the nlo scale uncertainties .",
    "we observe that the r@xmath46 uncertainties are small and there is only a marginal reduction in the scale uncertainties at @xmath7 .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that we are favoring regions of the phase space associated with new topologies entering at nnlo which are only computed at lo .",
    "the integrated cross section for one lepton flavor , @xmath47 , dominated by the low @xmath41 region , increases only by about 5@xmath45 from 25.7 @xmath48 1.0 ( scale ) fb at nlo to 26.9 @xmath48 0.9 ( scale ) @xmath49 0.4 ( r@xmath46 )  fb at @xmath7 .",
    "we have also computed the total cross sections for 7  tev at nlo and the result agrees with this quoted in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_max ] , we show differential distributions for the lepton with maximum @xmath5 for @xmath50 8 and @xmath50 14 @xmath51 , left and right panels respectively .",
    "we observe that the @xmath44 corrections are large at both energies .",
    "for the 14 @xmath51 run , these corrections are beyond the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties above @xmath52 150 gev .",
    "the same is true for the 8 @xmath51 case only at slightly higher @xmath5 . even though the effect is less pronounced than at 14 tev , due to the smaller relative importance of additional parton radiation , the corrections are at the 15@xmath45 level already at 200 @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , for the 14  tev case , we show the curves with a veto on the jets at nlo and @xmath44 where we require the absence of any jets with @xmath54  gev .",
    "the @xmath44-veto corrections are negative and beyond the scale uncertainties of the nlo - vetoed predictions .",
    "this might be of relevance for anomalous coupling searches since vetoed distributions are often used to suppress additional radiation .",
    "the entire @xmath44-veto result has larger scale uncertainties than the nlo - vetoed curves , thus revealing , partially , accidental cancellation happening at nlo .",
    "such a feature has been extensively discussed for jet vetoes also in the context of nnlo calculations of higgs - boson production , e.g.  @xcite and references therein .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : ptnu ] ( left ) , we show the differential distributions for the missing transverse energy .",
    "we see that the @xmath44 corrections to this observable can be as large as the 30@xmath45 , exceeding the scale uncertainty of the nlo result . in the right - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : ptnu ] , we show the cluster energy ( transverse mass of the wz system ) defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the transverse energy and the transverse momentum components of the bosons reconstructed from the four - momenta of the leptons .",
    "the @xmath7corrections to this observable are small , which means that this distribution is not particularly sensitive to the new topologies that appear at nnlo .",
    "for the same reason , the finite terms from the two - loop diagrams , which are missing in the @xmath7result , are of larger relative importance for this observable than they are for @xmath41 , @xmath58 or @xmath59 , which is also reflected in larger @xmath10 uncertainties in the @xmath60 case .",
    "the reason behind the marked difference in the relative size of the @xmath7corrections between @xmath61 and all the other observables which we have discussed is the following . for observables like @xmath58 or @xmath59 , to receive large contributions in the high-@xmath5 region ,",
    "it is enough that only one of the two bosons is produced at high @xmath5 .",
    "this high-@xmath5 boson recoils against a high-@xmath5 qcd parton .",
    "the other boson can be in particular soft and collinear to a quark and such configurations , one of which is depicted in the bottom diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , come with the @xmath62 enhancement . in the case of @xmath61 , however , the favored configurations are those in which both bosons have sizable @xmath5s and are preferably back to back therefore do not lead to logarithmic enhancements at nnlo .",
    "in this letter , we have used loopsim together with vbfnlo to compute an approximation to the nnlo qcd corrections for the process",
    "our result , referred to as @xmath7 , is expected to be accurate in the regions of phase space dominated by the topologies other than those present at lo . as in the underlying vbfnlo wz@nlo and wzj@nlo calculations , our treatment includes the leptonic decays of the vector bosons and all off - shell and finite - width effects .",
    "we found that the @xmath44 corrections to a number of observables are sizable at high @xmath5 and have non - trivial kinematic dependence .",
    "it is therefore important to take them into account in searches for physics beyond the sm and other physics analyses that involve wz production .",
    "the vbfnlo+loopsim code is available from the authors on request and it will be made public in the near future .",
