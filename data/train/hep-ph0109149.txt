    "certain decays of @xmath1-mesons are expected to shed light on the mechanism of @xmath0 violation and , more generally , on new physics . indeed , the first surprising results on the @xmath0-asymmetry @xmath6 in the decay @xmath7 raised the hope for a first new physics signal .",
    "meanwhile , the value of the measured asymmetry has changed considerably and the present world average  @xcite a_k^wa = 0.79 0.12 almost coincides with the standard model expectation  @xcite a_k^sm 0.70 0.10 .",
    "although this came as a disappointment , it reinforced the view that one should be prepared , both on the theoretical and the experimental side , for unexpected observations .",
    "in fact , the small error of the above world average and the improvements that are expected during the next years will allow to detect even small deviations from the standard model predictions .",
    "there are of course many new physics scenarios . on the one hand",
    ", it is possible to describe their signatures in very general terms ( for recent expositions , see e.g. ) . on the other hand",
    ", one can propose a specific new physics model and investigate its consequences .",
    "the latter approach was the topic of a huge body of work .",
    "for what concerns supersymmetric models , emphasis was given recently to the so - called minimal flavour violating models ( mfv )  @xcite and their possible variants  @xcite .    in virtually all new physics models , new non - standard fields are introduced and , therefore , new complex ( i.e. with @xmath0-violating phases ) couplings appear .",
    "this is well known in supersymmetry to which we turn for definiteness . in supersymmetric models",
    "there are several classes of phases .",
    "those in the @xmath8 and flavour diagonal @xmath9 terms do not contribute to flavour changing processes but are strongly bound by the electric dipole moment of the neutron and other particles  @xcite .",
    "the phases of the yukawa couplings are the same as in the standard model .",
    "if these are the only phases and flavour changing couplings of a model , the latter belongs to the class of mfv supersymmetric models that exhibit many analogies to the standard model  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the most interesting phases are those in the squark and slepton mass matrices .",
    "their flavour diagonal elements are either real by definition ( in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 sectors ) or small ( in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 ones ) as pointed out before ( restrictions from electric dipole moments ) . therefore the flavour changing elements ( i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in the sectors @xmath10 , @xmath13 , etc . )",
    "are the most interesting ones and we will focus on their effects .",
    "they contribute mainly through loop diagrams with internal gluinos and charginos .",
    "since we are interested in contributions to wilson coefficients that are already quite large in the sm  ( i.e. the coefficients of the qcd penguin and chromo - magnetic dipole moment operators ) , we will only discuss gluino loops ; in fact , they tend to dominate over the corresponding chargino ones .",
    "clearly this is not the first analysis of such susy diagrams .",
    "their impact on flavour physics is known since a long time  @xcite , and there are numerous recent investigations . to clarify the new aspects provided in this paper , we review briefly some of the most recent efforts .    in a first comprehensive analysis of the gluino exchanges",
    "was given .",
    "the systematics of the perturbative expansion was investigated in , which also included an analysis of the mass insertion approximation : the latter was found to be sufficient in many cases and we will use it again in this study . in the bounds from the rare decay @xmath16 were derived ; however , the various couplings were assumed to be real .",
    "in , the influence on the electromagnetic penguins ( isospin violating terms ) and the consequences on @xmath17 decays were studied ; particular focus was given to the determination of the @xmath18 angle @xmath19 . in effects of new terms on direct @xmath0-violating asymmetries in charged decays were given , but the possible values of the new coefficients were not investigated . in a completely general parameterization of new physics effects in the decays",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath3 was given ; however , no particular model was explicitely studied . in",
    ", the case of left - right symmetric models were investigated and it was found that , in these models , sizeable deviations from the relation @xmath20 are possible .    in this paper , we consider the * complex * @xmath21 entries in the down squark mass matrix and work out their consequences for the time dependent @xmath0 asymmetries in the decays @xmath4 and @xmath22 . in the standard model ,",
    "these asymmetries are equal and are a measure of the phase of the @xmath23-@xmath24 mixing amplitude ( which in the sm is @xmath25 ) .",
    "the complex couplings that we consider leave the @xmath23-@xmath24 mixing phase unchanged but have a significant impact on the amplitudes of the decays .",
    "the @xmath3 amplitude is dominated by sm tree level contributions and , consequently , the @xmath0-violating asymmetry is hardly modified ; on the other hand , there is room for such an effect in the transition @xmath4 .",
    "this decay is easily accessible at the @xmath1-factory experiments  @xcite and an investigation of the related @xmath0 asymmetries is clearly worthwhile . in the analysis",
    "we will concentrate on this decay .",
    "this note is organized as follows . in",
    "we review the effective hamiltonian for @xmath26 transitions in generic extensions of the standard model and give the explicit expressions of the various @xmath0 asymmetries .",
    "we also discuss the observables @xmath27 and @xmath28 which are related to the @xmath29 transition and provide interesting additional pieces of information . in we present the susy model that we consider and the explicit contributions to the wilson coefficients .",
    "the numerical analysis is presented in .",
    "the impact of the complex susy parameters on the branching ratio and @xmath0 asymmetry of @xmath30 is explored and we analyze the correlation between the mixing - induced ( and direct ) @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath4 and the @xmath31-@xmath32 mass difference .",

    "we find that the deviations from the @xmath149 expectation remain below 0.05 . for smaller values of @xmath150 much larger and thus observable contributions are possible .",
    "this strong dependence on the ratio between the gluino and squark masses is due to the particular dependence of the loop functions on @xmath146 .",
    "moreover , the presence of definite bands in the @xmath151 $ ] plane is due to an interplay between the @xmath30 constraint and the requirement of fixed @xmath28 .",
    "as previously stated , @xmath152 measures the deviation of the mixing - induced @xmath0 asymmetry from the standard model prediction .",
    "since all new physics in the @xmath23-@xmath24 mixing amplitude will affect the @xmath0 asymmetries in the decays @xmath7 and @xmath115 in the same way , @xmath152 is equal to @xmath153 where @xmath93 can be generated by other susy couplings that we do not consider here and @xmath154 is the phase of the @xmath115 decay amplitude . in other words , @xmath152 is the difference between the mixing - induced @xmath0 asymmetries in the decays @xmath7 and @xmath115 ( see also the discussion in ) .",

    "in the susy model that we consider , the weak phases @xmath157 are entirely due to the imaginary part of the mass insertions . using the above parametrization , we find that the ratio @xmath159 has an extremely tiny dependence on the phases @xmath157 ; therefore , the correspondence between @xmath155 and @xmath152 is almost one - to - one . in",
    ", we explicitely show this correlation .",
    "we considered the effects of sizeable flavour changing entries in the squark matrices on @xmath2 transitions .",
    "in particular we allowed for complex values of the relevant off - diagonal elements .",
    "we first investigated the bounds that these entries must obey in order to satisfy the @xmath16 data .",
    "shows that the inclusion of complex values for the mass insertion parameters strongly enlarges their allowed regions .",
    "in fact , the absolute values of the insertions can be much larger than in the existing literature where only real couplings were considered .",
    "moreover , there are interesting correlations between real and imaginary parts which may give important hints on the structure of the underlying theory .",
    "we then considered the influence of the new terms on the @xmath0-violating asymmetry in the decays @xmath4 and on the @xmath31-@xmath96 mixing ( the @xmath23-@xmath24 mixing is not affected by the terms we are interested in ) . in , we plot the deviation @xmath152 of the mixing - induced @xmath0 asymmetry in @xmath160 from the sm expectation versus the ratio @xmath112 .",
    "we see that @xmath152 can reach the @xmath161 level in some corners of the parameter space ; on the other hand , deviations of order @xmath162 are easily possible with moderately light squark and gluino masses .",
    "note that such large contributions are possible only for configurations in which @xmath163 . in a similar fashion , shows that the direct @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath155 can receive contributions of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we stress that in this framework effects on @xmath7 decays are expected to be tiny .",
    "the @xmath31-@xmath96 @xmath28 is very sensitive to the mass insertions we consider , while @xmath84 remains unaffected .",
    "this implies that the determination of @xmath164 from ratio @xmath165 may be misleading .",
    "moreover , as it follows from and [ adir ] , an experimental determination of @xmath28 in excess with respect to the sm prediction together with sizeable @xmath152 and @xmath155 would be strong signatures in favour of this kind of models . during the next year , the @xmath1-factories babar and belle will gather enough luminosity to study the @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath4 decays and will test this class of susy models soon .",
