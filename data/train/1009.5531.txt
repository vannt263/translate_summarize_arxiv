    "the proof outlined in the paper contains a gap that we intend to close in this work ; see the appendix for a detailed explanation of the problems in the proof given in @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of the current work is a new proof of the following theorem :    [ thm : mainapplicationc4t4 ] groups satisfying the algebraic @xmath0 condition are bi - automatic .",
    "it is a well known fact that a minimal van kampen diagram ( see section [ sec : vankampen ] ) over a presentation that satisfies the algebraic @xmath0 conditions has the property that every inner region has at least four neighbors and there are no inner vertices of valance three .",
    "we call such diagrams _ @xmath0 diagrams_. we say that a presentation satisfies the _ geometric _ @xmath0 small - cancellation condition if all _ minimal _ van kampen diagrams over this presentation are @xmath0 diagrams . thus , if a presentation satisfies the algebraic condition it follows that it satisfies the geometric condition ( the other direction is not true ) . notice that we used `` @xmath0 '' in three different objects ( two types of presentations and one type of diagrams ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : mainapplicationc4t4 ] in @xcite starts by applying the so - called `` barycentric sub - division '' ( which we describe in section [ sec : barysubdiv ] ) .",

    "if this procedure is applied to a presentation which satisfies the algebraic @xmath0 conditions then the result is a presentation which satisfies the _ geometric _ @xmath0 small - cancellation condition ( and other important properties ) but _ not _ the algebraic conditions .",

    "then , @xmath20 is a bi - automatic group .",
    "the main difference between the algebraic conditions and the geometric conditions is that in the geometric setup there may be diagrams which contain vertices of valence three ( under the algebraic setup diagrams may never contain vertices of valence three ) .",

    "but , in this case the inner path is labelled by two generators .",
    "thus , the diagram is not minimal . since we are assuming that the diagram is reduced it follows that the only way to reduce the number of regions is by replacing them with a single region ; this is illustrated in the right side of figure [ fig : innvertvaltwoandfix ] .",
    "the second examples is of a diagram with three regions and one inner vertex of valence three ; see the top part of figure [ fig : innvertvalthreeandfixes ] .",
    "due to the vertex of valence three , the diagram is not a @xmath207 diagrams .",
    "it follows from the first condition of hypothesis @xmath206 that this diagram is not minimal . in the bottom of the figure",
    "we illustrate three possible diagrams which have the same boundary label but with two regions ( clearly , reducing the number of regions to one is impossible due to the length of the boundary ) .",
    "it is important to note that since we assumed that the boundary label of the top diagram is freely - reduced we get that one of these examples is a diagram that can be constructed over the presentation @xmath2 .",
    "notice however that _ not _ necessarily all of the three diagrams can be constructed over the presentation @xmath2 ( because there my not be enough relations in @xmath2 to construct these diagrams ) .",
    "the main difference between the presentation @xmath2 and a presentation satisfying the algebraic @xmath0 conditions lays in the fact that one can construct reduced diagrams with inner vertices of valence three . as shown in figure [ fig : innvertvalthreeandfixes ] there may be up to _ three ways _ to reduce the number of regions in such diagrams . if there are _ at least two _ different ways to minimize such a diagram then we get two diagrams that have the same boundary label but which are not equivalent ( in the bottom of figure [ fig : innvertvalthreeandfixes ] we illustrate three diagrams with the same boundary label which are not equivalent ) . as we shall see later , it is important to understand this situation .",
    "we thus introduce the following terminology .",

    "is one starts from an admissible diagram and remove all the paths labelled by pieces in @xmath24 the result is a diagram over the presentation described in section [ sec : barysubdiv ] .",
    "thus , considering only admissible diagrams essentially means that they concentrate on the same diagrams which we describe in section [ sec : barysubdiv ] .",
    "right after the idea of admissible diagram , the definition of `` allowed word '' is introduced ( second definition in pg 652 ) .",

    "minimal_. we also give a proof of non - positive curvature of inner vertices at section [ sec : barysubdiv ] .",
    "our arguments are more combinatorial and they refer to a slightly different presentation ( as described in previous paragraph ) but nevertheless they are essentially the same .",
    "the bulk of the proof is outlined at the end of pg 655 .",
    "the automatic structure consists of `` allowed representatives '' .",
    "these are elements which are _ geodesics _ and for which the so - called `` @xmath554 turning angle condition '' holds ( see the first paragraph after the end of the proof at pg 655 ) .",

    ", the proof of the @xmath554 case , which is given in proposition 2.1 , uses the fact that a boundary vertex of valence three can not become an inner vertex by gluing some region over it .",
    "however , in the proof given in pg 655 a boundary vertex of valence three can indeed become an inner vertex by gluing some region over it .",
    "in other words , the the definition of `` allowed representatives '' uses a condition which should hold for _ every _ admissible diagram which includes the representative by referring to the angles along the representative .",
    "it follows that vertices of valence three along a possible representative in one diagram which includes it may become vertices of valence two when the representative is included in a different diagram .",
    "thus , one can not be sure that `` allowed representatives '' actually exist as the `` @xmath554 turning angle condition ''",
    "may never holds .",
    "we would like to point out another small problem .",
    "it is indicated that , since there are only finitely many configurations which are used to define the allowed representatives , the language of allowed representatives is regular ( forth paragraph of pg 655 ) .",
    "however , the assumption that allowed representatives are geodesics is problematic in this regard since one can not readily verify that a given word is a geodesic .",
