    "compass is an experiment at cern focusing on the spin structure of the nucleon and hadron spectroscopy . between 2002 and 2004 ,",
    "a 160 gev / c polarized muon beam and a two cell polarized @xmath4lid target were used for spin studies .",
    "for the 2006 data taking major updates of the spectrometer were made .",
    "here we present results for @xmath0 extracted from high transverse momentum hadrons pairs .",
    "the selection of these events increases the fraction of the _ photo - gluon fusion _ ( pgf ) in the sample , therefore increases sensitivity to the gluon polarization .",
    "so far data from 2002 - 2004 years were analyzed .",
    "the analysis of the 2006 data is in progress .",
    "the @xmath0 value was extracted for both the @xmath1 ( gev / c)@xmath3 and the @xmath5 ( gev / c)@xmath3 regions . in this paper",
    "we present the new result for the @xmath1 ( gev / c)@xmath3 analysis . for the low q@xmath3 data the obtained result is @xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "similar analyzes where performed in smc @xcite and hermes @xcite .",
    "in addition , compass measured @xmath0 for open charm events , which are believed to be a clean source of pgf . the description of that analysis can be found in this proceedings , @xmath7 contribution by florent robinet .",
    "an incoming and a scattered muon as well as an interaction vertex in the target are required for each event .",
    "the kinematic cuts @xmath8 and @xmath1 ( gev / c)@xmath3 are applied .",
    "the latter cut ensures that scale of the hard process is high enough so that pqcd can be used .",
    "we require at least two charged hadrons in the interaction vertex with transverse momentum above 0.7  gev / c each , their @xmath9 as well as @xmath10 have to be larger than 0 .",
    "in addition , is also required that the sum of the energy fraction of the two hadrons is @xmath11 and that their invariant mass is @xmath12 gev / c@xmath3 .",
    "the total number of selected events is about 500k .",
    "in the leading order qcd there are three sub - processes which contribute to the total cross - section : leading order ( lo ) , qcd compton ( qcdc or c ) , and photo gluon - fusion ( pgf ) .",
    "the cross - section asymmetry for high transverse momentum hadrons pair can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are analyzing powers and @xmath15 are the fractions of sub - processes in the sample . in a similar way the cross - section asymmetry @xmath16 can be decomposed . combining the two asymmetries ,",
    "the following relation holds : @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20    there are two points worth mentioning about the formulas .",
    "firstly , a @xmath21 can not be neglected for the @xmath0 extraction .",
    "it was found that the average value of @xmath22 in the sample is about 0.14 .",
    "for such a high @xmath23 value @xmath16 and therefore @xmath21 are no longer zero .",
    "secondly , @xmath24 determines the precision of the measured @xmath0 . in the first approximation it is proportional to a difference between the pgf fractions for the high-@xmath25 and the inclusive samples .",
    "if the difference between the two fractions is small the statistical error of @xmath0 will be large .",
    "neglecting the impact of pgf events from the inclusive sample would lead to underestimation of the statistical error of @xmath0 .    to increase the statistical precision of the gluon polarization measurement a weighted method of asymmetry extraction",
    "mthe weight is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the dilution factor @xmath28 is the depolarization factor , @xmath29 is the beam polarization .",
    "the weight has to be known on the event by event basis .",
    "this means that for every event we have to know : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "only the last three quantities are calculated from data , all others have to be obtained from mc .",
    "a neural network ( nn ) trained on mc samples was used for the parametrization of these quantities . as an input to the nn training for the inclusive sample , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "were selected while for the high@xmath35 sample in addition transverse and longitudinal momenta of the two hadrons were used .",
    "this method of @xmath0 extraction depends largely on mc .",
    "good data description with the mc as well as good nn parameterizations are the `` key points '' of this analysis .",
    "to extract @xmath0 two mc samples are needed : an inclusive and a high-@xmath25 . the lepto generator and full simulation of the compass spectrometer were used .",
    "mrst04 lo was used for the parton distribution functions given the very good description of @xmath36 in compass kinematics .",
    "the gluon radiation in the initial and final state were allowed in the generator ( the so called parton shower on ) .",
    "this simulates part of nlo corrections .",
    "the parton shower off was used to estimate systematics . to improve the data and mc agreement the lepto parameters were tuned ( @xmath37 and parameters of fragmentation ) .",
    "standard lepto tuning was used for systematic studies . in figure [ fig::mccompar ]",
    "examples of data - mc comparison are shown for the transverse momenta of the first and the second hadron respectively . in the right - most plot the comparison between standard and tuned lepto is shown for @xmath38 .",
    "we observe good agreement between data and mc , also necessity for lepto tuning is clearly visible .",
    "the nn parameterizations of the variables used in the weight were compared with original mc samples and good agreement was found . as an example we show in figure [ fig::nn1 ] the comparison between the fractions of the processes as a function of @xmath39     from mc and nn parametrization.,width=359 ]     from mc and nn parametrization.,width=359 ]",
    "various systematic studies were performed to estimate the systematic uncertainty of the extracted @xmath0 .",
    "summary is given in table [ tab::sys ] .",
    "the main contribution comes from the mc , other contributions like false asymmetries , uncertainties of the beam / target polarization , dilution factor , radiative correction , simplification of the formula for @xmath0 extraction , @xmath16 parametrization and nn parametrization stability were found to be much smaller .",
    "l0.35    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the mc error gives the largest contribution to the systematic error its estimation will be described in more details . for these studies we were using four mc samples : tuned lepto with parton shower on / off and standard lepto tuning with parton shower on / off . this way we estimated the impact of the mc tuning and partially the impact of nlo corrections .",
    "in addition , we made three extraction of @xmath0 with each of mc samples .",
    "in the first one we were using samples as they were , in the second one using nn we selected events from regions of phase space where data and mc agrees well in the last one variation we re - weighted mc events so that ratio data over mc is equal to 1 .",
    "this way we obtained 12 values of @xmath0 . from their distribution we estimated the mc systematic error to be about 0.04 .",
    "the preliminary result for @xmath0 for high transverse momentum hadron pairs with @xmath1 ( gev / c)@xmath3 is @xmath40 .",
    "the average @xmath41 for the data was about 0.08 , and average scale of the process about 3 ( gev / c)@xmath3 .",
    "the result is consistent with zero . the statistical precision with respect to the previous measurement from compass in the @xmath1 ( gev / c)@xmath3 range increased by factor 3 .",
    "the presented result is also in good agreement with the @xmath0 result obtain for low the @xmath34 high-@xmath25 analysis .",
    "the preliminary result for @xmath0 for high transverse momentum hadron pairs with @xmath1 ( gev / c)@xmath3 , was presented : @xmath40 .",
    "the result is compatible with zero as well as with other direct measurements of @xmath0 from compass , hermes and smc .",
    "the presented data used 2002 - 2004 data . with additional 2006 data and future upgrade of the analysis method",
    "we expect to at least double available statistics .",
