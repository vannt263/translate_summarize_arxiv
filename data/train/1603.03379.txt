    "eli - np is the state - of - the - arts laser facility which has proposed the real experiments of radiation reaction ( the green area in this figure ) @xcite[fighifp ] ]    however in the real computation , the orthogonality and the completeness of the dirac - volkov spinor interacting with `` general photonic fields '' is not obvious .",
    "it has not been known well whether can we construct its hilbert space under such a generalized condition , yet . in the fact , there are the demonstrations only in the case of an external `` plane wave '' field @xcite .",
    "since strong focused and superpositioned lasers shall not be a plane wave in nature , hence the other new methods should be desired in high - intensity field physics .",
    "figure [ fighifp ] is the strategy of the investigation of radiation reaction how to reach the regime of high - intensity field physics .",
    "the key parameters of high - intensity field physics are the speed of a particle @xmath32 ( the relativity ) , the planck constant @xmath12 ( the quantization ) and the field amplitude @xmath33 ( the intensity ) .",

    "since we have several classical models of radiation reaction , it seems to be well adopted by just borrowing the result from it .",
    "however , the feasibility of the coupled system between a stochastic particle and fields is not enough established .",
    "hence , the realization of the field - generation from a stochastic charged particle must become a milestone for describing radiation reaction in high - intensity fields .",
    "let us recall radiation reaction as the coupling system in classical dynamics .",
    "the standard model of it was derived by p. a. m. dirac , named the lorentz - abraham - dirac ( lad ) equation @xcite .",
