    "in @xcite , richard cohn coined the term  the overdetermined triad \" in order to draw the reader s attention away from the celebrated acoustic attractiveness of the major and minor triads to some surprising algebraic properties of the family of the consonant triads .",
    "the starting point for the present investigation is a puzzling ramification of this over - determination of the triads even within the realm of algebraic music theory . in particular , the musical and music - theoretical prevalence of three tone - collections",
    " major / minor mixture , hexatonic , and octatonic  emerges from the study of triads in quite different algebraic ways .    in the context of a group - theoretic approach ( see @xcite ) one obtains these collections as carrier sets , which are covered by particular families of triads , which are orbits under certain group actions .",
    "under this perspective it is the interplay of several triads , which makes these collections prevalent among others .    in the context of a monoid - theoretic approach ( see @xcite ) one obtains these collections as extensions of a single triad .",

    "tierney topologies , which also imply the prevalence of the three sets @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 as extensions of a single triad .",
    "how do these two approaches fit together ?",
    "the present article prepares the group - theoretical grounding for a comprehensive answer and anticipates the remaining work on the topos - theoretical side in the concrete case of @xmath1 .",
    "though this article does not require any topos theory , we have included an appendix on topos theory in section  [ sec : appendix ] for any readers who want to recall the main notions .",
    "we first briefly recall the notion of dual groups in transformational analysis , give the fundamental example of left and right regular representations , and show how to construct general dual groups in view of the left and right regular representations . as an example",
    ", we reconstruct the well - known @xmath0-group as the dual group to the @xmath6-group acting on consonant triads .",
    "let @xmath7 be the symmetric group on the set @xmath8 .",
    "two subgroups @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the symmetric group @xmath7 are called _ dual _ if their natural actions on @xmath8 are simply transitive and each is the centralizer of the other , that is , @xmath11    [ examp : left / right_regular_representations ] if @xmath9 is any group , the left and right regular representations @xmath12 are defined by @xmath13 and @xmath14 . as is well known , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are injective and the natural actions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are simply transitive . the images @xmath17 and @xmath18 clearly commute , since @xmath19 . in fact , @xmath18 is the centralizer of @xmath17 in @xmath20 , for if @xmath21 is a bijection satisfying @xmath22 for all @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath9 , then @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the same as @xmath27 .",

    "the group @xmath18 is the dual group to @xmath17 , which we sought to construct .",
