    "for example , william and durand  @xcite showed that an appropriate noise intensity can improve the detection of subthreshold signals in a resonant manner .",
    "higgs et al .",
    "@xcite found that synaptic noise increases the gain in many pyramidal neurons with large sahp ( slow after hyperpolarization ) .",
    "jacobson et al .",
    "@xcite found that channel noise contributes significantly to membrane voltage fluctuations at the subthreshold voltage range . in theoretical and computational studies , the constructive role of noise in neuronal systems has been reported as well .",
    "for example , it was shown that noise is able to evoke coherence and stochastic resonance in single neurons ,  @xcite as well as in one - dimensional  @xcite and two - dimensional  @xcite neuronal networks .",
    "related to the present study , in the sense that correlated noisy inputs have been considered , are the two papers by kreuz et al .",
    "@xcite where it has been shown that an intermediate noise intensity can evoke the most coherent temporal output of a single neuron irrespective of the noise correlation length .",
    "double coherence resonance in terms of an optimal combination of noise intensity and correlation was reported as well .",
    "notably , the effect of auto- and cross - correlations of input spikes on the response of spiking neurons has also been studied extensively .",

    "thus , activity of this single interneuron will provide correlated input to many neurons in the local circuit .",
    "@xcite furthermore , correlated inputs might be stimulus driven and usually are random .",
    "these random correlated inputs can be described by means of correlated noise . in the past , noise correlations have , apart from a few exceptions ,  @xcite usually been ignored . but some researchers have found that noise correlations can have many different effects on the neuronal population @xmath0 the amount of information encoded , the computational strategies of networks of neurons , etc .",
    ", as reviewed in ref .  .",
    "this means that noise correlations should not be neglected in neuronal systems .",
    "adding to this conclusion is also the fact that the conceptually related coupling via noise in one - dimensional  @xcite and two - dimensional  @xcite systems has been found to induce synchronization .",
    "meanwhile , the question of how a postsynaptic neuron is affected by the presynaptic neuronal population is still not fully understood .",
    "there is an ongoing debate on whether a cortical neuron is driven mainly by the mean firing rate of presynaptic neurons or by correlated firing activities .",
    "@xcite no matter what the outcome of the debate , the mean firing rate and correlations of neuronal groups are two important factors in investigating transmission of neuronal information .",
    "therefore , we will investigate the effects of correlated gaussian noise ( noise correlation ) on the mean firing rate and correlations of a neuronal population in this paper .",
    "the obtained results may have important implications for understanding the transmission of neuronal information .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "equations governing the two - dimensional neuronal network are presented in the next section .",
    "measures used for quantifying the observed neuronal dynamics are introduced in section  [ sec:3 ] , while the results due to correlated gaussian noise are presented in section  [ sec:4 ] .",

    "we also provide an algorithmic description of noise generation in the appendix .",
    "the correlated gaussian noise @xmath16 is expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gaussian white noise and common to all units , _ i.e. _ global noise , with the properties : @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the local gaussian noise , which is uncorrelated from site to site .",
    "@xmath20 is taken as gaussian white noise with the properties : @xmath21 and gaussian colored noise with the properties : @xmath22 respectively . here",
    "@xmath23 is the noise intensity of the global noise @xmath18 , @xmath24 is the noise intensity of the local noise @xmath20 , and @xmath25 is the correlation time of the local gaussian colored noise . here",
    "we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 measures the noise correlation between a pair of neurons .",
    "@xmath16 is renewed at each iteration step @xmath6 and for each unit @xmath4 in the iterated processing according to the algorithm proposed in ref .",
    "( see appendix for details ) . in the following discussions",
    ", we will take @xmath23 and @xmath28 as controlled parameters .",
    "two measures for quantifying the observed neuronal dynamics due to the impact of noise are employed .",
    "one is the mean firing rate @xmath29 ,  @xcite and the other is the population coherence @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite the mean firing rate of the neuronal network is defined as @xmath31\\right>_t,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the firing threshold determined by the action potential of the rulkov neuron .",
    "notably , @xmath33 is a heaviside function with @xmath34 if @xmath35 and @xmath36 if @xmath37 .",
    "the bracket @xmath38 indicates the average over the whole iteration time @xmath39 .    to quantify the correlations of firing events in the neuronal network ,",
    "we introduce the population coherence measure @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite @xmath40 is defined as the average of the local coherence @xmath41 over all the pairs of neurons , namely : @xmath42 where @xmath43 the coherence @xmath41 between any two neurons @xmath44 and @xmath45 is measured by the cross - correlation of their spike trains at zero time lag within a time interval @xmath46 .",
    "more specifically , we divide the full iteration time @xmath39 into small bins of duration @xmath47 and define the two spike trains as @xmath48 or @xmath49 and @xmath50 or @xmath49 @xmath51 , whereby @xmath52 if the onset of a spike occurred at the @xmath53-th time bin , otherwise @xmath54 . sometimes , the population coherence measure @xmath40 is also used to quantify the synchronization of neuronal firings in networks .",
    "@xcite larger population coherence @xmath30 corresponds to higher correlations between neurons inside the network .",
    "[ 0.75 ]    [ 0.75 ]    in order to discern clearly the distinct effects of correlated gaussian noise on neuronal dynamics , we consider firstly the effects of _ local _ gaussian noise , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "variations of the mean firing rate @xmath29 and the population coherence measure @xmath30 with respect to the noise intensity @xmath23 for various coupling strengthes @xmath14 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] .",
    "importantly , local gaussian noise is white in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] but colored in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . from these two figures",
    ", we can see that @xmath29 and @xmath30 can reach larger values at an intermediate noise intensity than at smaller and larger noise intensities , for both local gaussian white and colored noise .",
    "we caution , however , that for large noise intensities the mean firing rate @xmath29 may yield spurious results because of the very noisy output of individual neurons forming the neuronal network , due to which it is practically impossible to discern what is a firing event and what not . in accordance with this ,",
    "the results depicted in this paper are constrained to noise intensities for which the neuronal dynamics still plays a significant role , i.e. , is not completely overshadowed by noise .",
    "the above - reported results can be interpreted as follows .",
    "small noise intensities are unable to evoke excitations , accordingly , the mean firing rate @xmath29 becomes zero and the coherence of neurons inside the network is small ( _ i.e. _ @xmath30 is small ) . for intermediate noise intensities , typically only a few neurons ( at random ) forming the lattice start firing . due to the diffusive coupling and the noisy support the excitations",
    "can propagate regularly to the neighbors , which results in well ordered circular waves ( as shown in ref .  )",
    "that ultimately result in high firing rate @xmath29 and large coherence @xmath30 . while for large noise intensities , neurons inside the network exhibit high - rate spiking behavior .",
    "when such spiking neurons are coupled diffusively , they tend to suppress the inputs coming from other neurons , which in turn decreases the number of firing events in a time span and destroys the spatial order of the dynamics , finally leading to small @xmath29 and a decreases of @xmath30",
    ". therefore , for local gaussian noise , the mean firing rate and the correlations of the neuronal network can be optimized by some intermediate noise intensities , as shown in figs.[fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] .    in what follows , we examine more closely the effects of correlated gaussian noise via controlling the noise correlation @xmath28 .",
    "variations of the mean firing rate @xmath29 and the population coherence measure @xmath30 with respect to the noise intensity @xmath23 for various noise correlations @xmath28 are shown in figs.[fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the local gaussian noise is taken as white in figs.[fig:4 ] and colored in figs.[fig:5 ] , respectively .",
    "compared with the results shown in figs.[fig:2](a ) and [ fig:3](a ) , we can see that variations of @xmath29 with respect to the noise intensity @xmath23 under correlated gaussian noise are similar as the ones under local gaussian noise .",
    "[ 0.75 ]    for the population coherence @xmath30 , however , we can see that its variations versus the noise intensity @xmath23 are strongly dependent on the noise correlation @xmath28 as shown in figs.[fig:4](b ) and [ fig:5](b ) .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the occasional non - smoothness of the curves in the later two figures is predominantly a consequences of the somewhat erratic switching between the emergence of spatially ordered patterns and their absence on the network .",
    "the latter introduces some non - smoothness to the employed statistical quantifiers , yet we found it impossible to eliminate this by means of more intensive numerical investigations .",
    "the reader is also referred to ref .  , where pattern formation due to correlated gaussian noise has been studied earlier . through comparisons with the corresponding results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) and [ fig:3](b ) , we find that effects of correlated gaussian noise on the population coherence @xmath30 look more complex than the ones of local gaussian noise . in the case of local gaussian white noise , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) , a weak coherent behavior ( there exists a small peak at an intermediate @xmath23 ) can be observed for small @xmath28 , e.g. , @xmath56 . and",
    "for an intermediate @xmath28 ( @xmath57 ) , the variations of @xmath30 become irregular with changing of the noise intensity . with further increasing of @xmath28 , a plateau region of @xmath30",
    "emerges as the noise intensity @xmath23 increases , as can be observed from the line corresponding to @xmath58 , for example . for local gaussian colored noise , variations of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath23",
    "are irregular at @xmath59 , and exhibit plateau regions with increasing of @xmath23 for large @xmath28 , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) .",
    "[ 0.75 ]    notably , the underlining mechanism regarding the effects of correlated gaussian noise on the mean firing rate @xmath29 is similar as discussed above in the case of local gaussian noise .",
    "however , in order to clarify the effects of noise correlation @xmath28 on the complicated variations of @xmath30 versus @xmath23 , we introduce the quantity @xmath60 which is the noise strength ratio between global and local noise .",
    "@xmath61 when local noise is taken as gaussian white noise , and @xmath62 when it is taken as gaussian colored noise .",
    "thus , values of @xmath63 can be controlled by the noise correlation @xmath28 and @xmath64 .",
    "we calculate the variations of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath23 for different noise intensity ratios @xmath63 , or equivalently , different pairs of @xmath65 .",
    "the obtained results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](a ) , where pairs of @xmath28 and @xmath64 are colored black if the variation of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath23 shows a weak coherence . at this point",
    "it is instructive to examine the corresponding curves for @xmath59 and @xmath66 that are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) .",
    "conversely , pairs of @xmath28 and @xmath64 are colored gray if variations of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath23 are irregular , as can be observed observed from the corresponding curves for @xmath67 and @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) and from the curve depicted for @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) .",
    "finally , @xmath65 pairs are colored white if there exists a plateau region of @xmath30 for large @xmath23 , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) for @xmath58 and in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath68 and @xmath71 . in order to now appreciate the quantity @xmath63 introduced in eq .  ( 8) as an important driving force behind the variations @xmath30 with respect to @xmath23 , we show in fig .  [ fig:6](b ) how @xmath63 varies for different pairs of @xmath28 and @xmath64 in a systematic manner . in particular , from thus far presented results it can be concluded that there exist three intervals of @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath72 , within which the variations of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath23 are different from one another . in fig .",

    "[ fig:6](a ) , we can observe at a glance that by setting @xmath76 and @xmath77 to equal @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , the color patterns match nearly perfectly , from which we conclude that @xmath63 indeed has a decisive impact on variations of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "[ 0.63 ]    from the analysis of the effects of correlated gaussian noise , we now thus know that noise correlations have no notable effects on the variations of @xmath29 versus @xmath23 , while conversely , the noise correlation @xmath28 plays a crucial role in how @xmath30 varies with respect to @xmath23 , in particular by means of controlling the noise strength ratio @xmath63 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied effects of correlated gaussian noise on neuronal firings , measured by the mean firing rate and the population coherence , of a two - dimensional network , which is locally modeled by the rulkov map .",
    "based on our numerical simulations , we have found that the mean firing rate of the network @xmath29 can be enhanced at some intermediate noise intensities by correlated gaussian noise for any noise correlation @xmath28 .",
    "this phenomenon is similar as the coherence resonance , even though there is not a well - defined optimal noise intensity . while for population coherence measure @xmath30",
    ", we find that its variations with respect to noise intensity are very complex .",
    "furthermore , we reveal that it strongly depends on the ratio @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , through the measure for population coherence @xmath30 , we have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the interactions between global and local noise . in particular , we have shown that an appropriately tuned global noise can be an effective promotor of correlations of firing events in the neuronal network .    as we have already stated in the introduction ,",
    "it is still debatable whether a cortical neuron is driven mainly by the mean firing rate of presynaptic neurons or by correlations between pairs of neurons inside the neuronal network .",
    "moreover , neurons inside neuronal networks are not only affected by local random fluctuations , but also stimulated by some common random inputs . thus , the results obtained for discussing effects of correlated gaussian noise on the mean firing rate and correlations of the neuronal network may give some important implications on investigating transmission of neuronal information in neuronal networks .",
