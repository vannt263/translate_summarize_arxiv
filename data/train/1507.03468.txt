    "the solid blue line in fig .  [ pll_hidden_phase_portret ] corresponds to the trajectory with the loop filter initial state @xmath31 and the vco phase shift @xmath32 rad .",
    "this line tends to the periodic trajectory , therefore it will not acquire lock .",
    "the solid red line corresponds to the trajectory with the loop filter initial state @xmath33 and the vco initial phase @xmath34 .",
    "this trajectory lies just under the unstable periodic trajectory and tends to a stable equilibrium . in this case",
    "pll acquires lock .",
    "all trajectories between stable and unstable periodic trajectories tend to the stable one ( see , e.g. , a solid green line ) .",
    "therefore , if the gap between stable and unstable periodic trajectories is smaller than the discretization step , the numerical procedure may slip through the stable trajectory .",
    "in other words , the simulation will show that the pll acquires lock , but in reality it is not the case .",
    "the considered case corresponds to the coexisting attractors ( one of which is so - called hidden oscillation ) and the bifurcation of birth of semistable trajectory @xcite .",
    "an oscillation in a dynamical system can be easily localized numerically if the initial conditions from its open neighborhood lead to long - time behavior that approaches the oscillation .",
    "thus , from a computational point of view , it is natural to suggest the following classification of attractors , based on the simplicity of finding the basin of attraction in the phase space @xcite : _ an attractor is called a _ hidden attractor _",
    "if its basin of attraction does not intersect with small neighborhoods of equilibria , otherwise it is called a _ self - excited attractor_. _    for a _ self - excited attractor _ its basin of attraction is connected with an unstable equilibrium and , therefore , self - excited attractors can be localized numerically by the _",
    "standard computational procedure _",
    ", in which after a transient process a trajectory , started from a point of an unstable manifold in a neighborhood of an unstable equilibrium , is attracted to the state of oscillation and traces it .",
    "thus self - excited attractors can be easily visualized .",
    "in contrast , for a hidden attractor its basin of attraction is not connected with unstable equilibria .",
    "for example , hidden attractors are attractors in the systems with no equilibria or with only one stable equilibrium ( a special case of multistable systems and coexistence of attractors ) .",
    "the derivation of mathematical model in signal s phase space and the use of the results of its analysis to draw conclusions about the behavior of real model in the signal space have need for a rigorous foundation .",
    "but the attempts to justify analytically the reliability of conclusions , based on such engineering approaches , and to study the nonlinear models of pll - based circuits are quite rare in the modern engendering literature @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons is that `` _ nonlinear analysis techniques are well beyond the scope of most undergraduate courses in communication theory _ '' @xcite .",
    "note once more that various simplifications and the analysis of linearized models of control systems may result in incorrect conclusions ( see , e.g. , the counterexamples to the filter hypothesis , aizerman s and kalman s conjectures on the absolute stability of nonlinear control systems @xcite , and the perron effects of the largest lyapunov exponent sign reversals @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "in the work it is shown that 1 ) the consideration of simplified models , constructed intuitively by engineers and 2 ) the application of non - rigorous methods of analysis ( e.g. , simulation and linearization ) can lead to wrong conclusions concerning the operability of the classical phase - locked loop .",
    "similar examples for nonlinear costas loop models can be found in @xcite .",
