    "the continued absence of a line detection in the gamma - ray burst spectra accumulated by the burst and transient source detector ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _",
    "( palmer et al . 1994 ; henceforth paper  i ) has led us to continue not only the search for lines in the batse data ( briggs et al . 1996 ) , but also our study of the detectability of lines by the batse detectors and the statistical implications of the current results .",
    "in particular , we are evaluating the consistency between the batse observations and those of previous missions , particularly those of .",
    "these calculations assume the batse detectors function properly and that our models of their performance are accurate , assumptions which we test continuously ( paciesas et al .",
    "1997 ; preece et al . 1997 ) .",
    "here we fill a major gap in our statistical methodology and implement it for the batse data .",
    "the description of our statistical methodology is clearest using conditional probabilities and their associated notation .",
    "thus @xmath4 means the probability of proposition @xmath5 given proposition @xmath6 .",
    "a bar over a proposition denotes the negation of that proposition .",
    "since we need to differentiate between quantities which refer either to a burst as a whole or to a specific spectrum accumulated over a portion of the burst , we use the convention that roman indices specify spectra and greek indices identify bursts .",
    "for example , @xmath7 represents the proposition that a line exists in the @xmath8th burst , while @xmath9 is the proposition that a line is present in the @xmath10th spectrum ; technically the burst within which the spectrum was accumulated should also be indicated ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) , but the burst will be understood from the context . as a reminder that these probabilities rely on our understanding of the detectors and gamma - ray bursts we include as one of the givens the proposition @xmath12 , which represents our model of the detector response , our parameterization of the burst continuum , etc .",
    "our calculations can be seriously in error if our assumptions expressed by @xmath12 are incorrect .",
    "for example , we use the `` grb '' spectral function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) to model the continuum , but this spectral shape is not based on the source physics , and therefore must be incorrect at some level of accuracy .    our analysis of the possible line content of a burst sample is based on a hierarchy of probabilities . ultimately we want the probability @xmath13 of obtaining the observed data ( proposition @xmath14 ) assuming hypothesis @xmath15 ( band et al . 1994 ,",
    "hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "thus @xmath14 might represent the statement that no lines have been detected in the batse database , and @xmath15 might be the hypothesis that lines exist and that we are modeling batse correctly .",
    "the information which might be represented by @xmath12 and @xmath15 overlaps ; in general @xmath15 should include the information which differs when hypotheses are compared .",
    "also known as the likelihood for @xmath15 , @xmath13 can be used in measures of the consistency between batse and previous detectors .",
    "our methodology does not result in @xmath13 directly , but rather in @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the line frequency , the probability that a line is found in a given burst .",
    "when necessary , this dependence on @xmath17 is removed by the bayesian process of `` marginalization . '' since bursts are presumably independent events , @xmath18 is the product of the probabilities of obtaining the observed detections or nondetections in each burst .",
    "thus , for the @xmath19 batse bursts in which no lines have been detected @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the proposition that a line has been detected in the @xmath8th burst , and therefore @xmath22 is the probability of detecting a line in this burst . if present , a line may persist over a time range shorter than the burst duration , and will be found in the @xmath10th spectrum accumulated during the burst .",
    "therefore @xmath22 will be a function of the probability @xmath23 of detecting the line in the @xmath10th spectrum ; @xmath24 is the proposition that the line was detected in the @xmath10th spectrum .",
    "the connection between @xmath22 and @xmath25 is presented in this paper .",
    "the line detection may be real or false , and therefore ( band et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter paper  iii ) @xmath26 where @xmath9 is the proposition that the line is present in the @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath27 is the probability of detecting a line in a spectrum and @xmath28 is the probability of a `` false positive . ''",
    "currently we assume that our detection criteria are stringent enough to make the false positive rate negligible , an assumption we will investigate in the future . in this paper we also discuss the database describing the batse spectra necessary to calculate @xmath29 ; we also present some results of utilizing this database .",
    "the probability @xmath27 of detecting a line which is present in the @xmath10th spectrum is the foundation of our methodology .",
    "if they exist , lines are undoubtedly characterized by a currently unknown distribution of energy centroids , line widths , intensities ( e.g. , equivalent widths ) , and perhaps other parameters . the detectability of each line type can be considered separately ; we generally have been using the lines reported by  in the s1 segment of gb  870303 ( graziani et al .",
    "1992 ) and in gb  880205 ( murakami et al . 1988 ) as archetypes , although a generic set of lines can be used .",
    "we find ( paper  iii ) that the detectability of a given line is a function of the strength of the continuum ( i.e. , the signal - to - noise ratio  snr ) and the angle between the detector normal and the burst ( the burst angle ) .",
    "this study of line detectability shows that batse would have detected the lines reported by , assuming of course that batse functions as modeled .",
    "next we need @xmath30 , the probability of detecting a line somewhere in the @xmath8th burst given that the line is indeed present , which requires a relationship between the presence of a line in the @xmath8th burst and its presence in the @xmath10th spectrum within this burst .",
    "thus we may calculate that there is a very high probability of detecting a line in a given spectrum if it is present ( @xmath31 ) , but may conclude that even if a line is present somewhere in the burst , it is most likely not in the spectrum in question ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "for example , based on empirical evidence or theoretical prejudice we may believe that lines do not persist for the length of time over which the spectrum was accumulated .",
    "the few line detections from all the burst missions are insufficient to map out the line distribution ( e.g. , energies , intensities , widths , persistence times ) , and therefore we must model the probability @xmath33 that a line occurs in the @xmath10th spectrum , regardless of whether it is detectable .",
    "with @xmath34 for the bursts observed by different missions we can evaluate the consistency between these missions .",
    "both batse and  provided sufficient data to carry out such an analysis .",
    "we developed a number of measures of the consistency between these two missions using both standard `` frequentist '' ( paper  i ) and bayesian statistics ( paper  ii ) .",
    "in addition , values of @xmath34 for the bursts in the batse database can be used to identify the most promising bursts for further analysis .",
    "we first apply new line search techniques ( schaefer et al . 1994 ; briggs et al . 1996 ) to bursts in which lines are most likely to be detected .",
    "the statistical analysis outlined above requires a characterization of all the spectra from batse and , and measures of line detectability for both instruments .",
    "paper  iii provides the line detection probabilities for the batse spectroscopy detectors ( sds ) , the relevant batse detectors .",
    "below we describe the database of batse spectra created to characterize the batse bursts .",
    "fenimore et al .",
    "( 1993 ) performed a preliminary evaluation of the  data for the gb  880205 line set ; a more extensive extraction of the necessary  information is planned .    here",
    "we consider a `` real '' line to be a true feature in the spectrum that arrives at the detector ; most likely a real feature was emitted by the burst , although the feature may possibly have been imposed on the spectrum by astrophysical processes between the burst source and the detector .",
    "a `` detection '' is a feature which satisfies the detection criteria and is therefore considered to be a real line .",
    "note that we treat the detection of a line as a binary conclusion : a feature is either considered to be a detected line or it is ignored in subsequent analysis . unlike frequentist statistics , in which a hypothesis is either true or false , bayesian statistics ( which is used in paper  ii ) allows our confidence in a hypothesis to be quantified via a probability that the hypothesis is true . in principal we could develop a formalism which permits a fractional detection through the probability that a feature is real .",
    "we could then develop a methodology of using the entire spectral database to tease out the line distribution from all the spectral bumps and wiggles , most of which are undoubtedly fluctuations , but a small fraction of which might result from an underlying distribution of real lines .",
    "specifically , deviations from the distribution of line significances expected from mere fluctuations could be used to estimate the distribution of true spectral lines ; this assumes that the fluctuation distribution can be estimated accurately . however , most scientists are more comfortable working with definite detections and nondetections , and that is the route we have taken .",
    "our detection criteria are 1 ) that a spectral feature is significant in the spectrum from one detector , and 2 ) that all spectra from the detectors which observed the burst are consistent . until recently significance was defined using the @xmath35-test . however , as discussed in the appendix , the @xmath35-test is appropriate when the uncertainties on the measured quantities  here the counts in each channel  are unknown ( eadie et al .",
    "1971 ) , which is not the case here .",
    "we have therefore adopted a maximum likelihood ratio test which uses @xmath36 as the relevant statistic ( d.  lamb , private communication , 1995 ) . in practice",
    ", these two tests usually give comparable results .",
    "this paper begins with the method for connecting the probabilities of detecting a line in a given spectrum and anywhere in a burst (  2 ) .",
    "the resulting methodology requires the line detection probability for every burst spectrum accumulated by batse ; a database of parameters describing these spectra is required to calculate these probabilities (  3 ) .",
    "this data is used to rank the batse bursts by the maximum signal - to - noise ratio of any spectrum accumulated during a burst .",
    "this database is also utilized to find the number of bursts in which different line types could be detected under the assumption of a small line occurrence frequency (  4 ) ; this number is crucial to the study of consistency between the batse and  observations (  5 ) . in the first appendix",
    "we discuss the maximum likelihood ratio test which we have adopted to evaluate the significance of an observed line feature .",
    "the second appendix lists the large number of symbols used in this work .",
    "here we consider the probability of detecting a line in a single burst , and therefore we suppress the ( greek ) indices specifying the burst .",
    "also , we consider the probability of detecting a line of a given type specified by parameters such as energy centroid , intrinsic width and intensity ( but not the time over which the line is present ) ; the resulting calculation must be done for each line type .",
    "batse accumulates a series of consecutive spectra from four different sds ( the spectroscopy detector high energy resolution , burst  sherb  data type ) ; we refer to these basic spectra which provide the finest time resolution available as sherb spectra .",
    "we assume there are @xmath37 sherb spectra for a given detector across the burst from which it is possible to construct @xmath38 different averaged spectra composed of consecutive sherb spectra ; quantities describing these averaged spectra are specified by roman indices ( e.g. , @xmath9 means a line exists in the @xmath10th averaged spectrum ) .",
    "the probability of detecting a line in the burst as a whole is the probability of detecting a line in at least one of the spectra which can be searched , @xmath39\\ ] ] ( the probability of at least one detection is one minus the probability of no detections ) . as will be discussed below",
    ", the line frequency @xmath17 is the probability that a line is present somewhere in the burst , @xmath40 . a line detection in a given spectrum results either from the detection of a real line or a spurious detection ( i.e. , a `` false positive '' ) , @xmath41 where we use the fact that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are exhaustive .",
    "paper  iii calculated @xmath27 for the batse sds , while the probability of a spurious detection @xmath44 will be studied further , but is clearly dependent on the detection threshold .",
    "our focus here is @xmath42 , which is a statement of how lines occur in burst spectra .",
    "is the probability that a line occurs in a burst the same for all bursts , or does it depend on duration , spectral hardness or other burst properties ?",
    "do lines persist for a long time or for short intervals ?",
    "unfortunately , since there have been very few detections , we know very little about @xmath42 . therefore , we have to construct reasonable models of @xmath45 which we will use for further calculations .",
    "let @xmath46 be the probability density for a line beginning at @xmath47 and ending at @xmath48 .",
    "if we assume that the probability depends only on the time a line persists , and does not favor the beginning or end of the burst , then @xmath49 will depend only on the persistence time @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "since the data consist of discrete spectra , we can not isolate the spectrum over the precise interval during which a line is present ( if such exists since the line intensity may vary ) .",
    "instead , the line will be attributed to a particular sum of consecutive sherb spectra with an accumulation period overlapping the time the line was actually present ; conversely , a spectrum summed from a number of sherb spectra may show lines with a variety of beginning and end times .",
    "the probability that a line begins between @xmath52 and @xmath53 and ends between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and would be attributed to the @xmath10th spectrum accumulated between @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , is @xmath59 \\quad ; \\ ] ] the probability of a line existing in the burst is @xmath60 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the burst duration .",
    "these expressions are derived from @xmath62 = \\exp [ -\\sum_j p(l_j \\,|\\ , fhi)]$ ] , where @xmath63 is valid because @xmath64 ( i.e. , @xmath65 is small ) . finally , @xmath66 . in practice ,",
    "if the @xmath10th spectrum begins at @xmath56 and ends at @xmath57 , we use @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , with a somewhat more complicated expression for a single sherb spectrum .    as examples ,",
    "we consider three different functional forms for @xmath71 . in each case",
    "there are two major variants . the first variant ( eqs . [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] , and [ 11 ] below ) assumes that @xmath72 is the same function of the persistence time @xmath50 with the same normalization for all bursts , and thus the line frequency varies from burst to burst ( i.e.",
    ", lines are more likely to occur in long bursts ) .",
    "the second variant ( eqs . [ 8 ] , [ 10 ] , and [ 12 ] below ) assumes the line frequency is the same for all bursts and therefore the normalization of @xmath72 varies from burst to burst . in practice",
    "we use the second case .",

    "note that @xmath17 increases with the duration @xmath61 . on the other hand , if @xmath77 for each burst then the second variant is @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",

    "there is a strong dependence on the persistence time @xmath50 since @xmath84     \\left(1-e^{-b(t_{b2}-t_{b1})}\\right )     \\left(1-e^{b(t_{e2}-t_{e1})}\\right)$ ] .",
    "_ model 3 : _",
    "@xmath85 . assuming @xmath74 is constant for all bursts @xmath86 , \\nonumber\\\\ p(l \\,|\\ , chi ) & = & f = 1-\\exp[-ct^{2-b}/(2-b)(1-b ) ] \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where once again @xmath76 . requiring @xmath82 for all bursts",
    "leads to @xmath87 where as usual @xmath79 .",
    "here there is also a strong dependence on the persistence time @xmath50 .",
    "in paper  iii we found that the probability @xmath88 of detecting a line in a spectrum was a function of the spectrum s snr and the burst angle . therefore we need these quantities for each spectrum from all the detectors for which there are data for a given burst .",
    "because  reported lines at @xmath0  kev and @xmath89  kev , we use snr calculated between 25 and 35  kev .",
    "thus the snr measures the strength of the continuum in the energy range of interest which should mitigate the effect of different shape continua .",
    "we would like to search spectra with arbitrary beginning and end times , but the telemetry only provides spectra with discrete beginning and end times .",
    "our search is meant to find the combination of consecutive sherb spectra in which a candidate feature has the greatest significance .",
    "thus , if @xmath37 sherb spectra span a burst , we need to consider @xmath38 spectra . however , the database does not need to store parameters for all @xmath38 possible spectra since they can be calculated from a smaller set of data . here",
    "we assume that the burst angle and background count rate @xmath90 are constant for the entire burst for the detector providing the sherb spectra , a reasonable assumption since the burst durations are usually less than @xmath91  s ( the time scale over which the background rate might change significantly enough to affect our results ; the burst angle will change on much longer time scales ) .",
    "the snr for each possible spectrum can be calculated from the counts and accumulation time for each sherb spectrum .",
    "thus @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of detected counts summed over all the sherb spectra of which the @xmath10th spectrum consists , @xmath90 is the background count rate , @xmath94 is the time over which the spectrum was accumulated ( i.e. , the sum of the accumulation times of the constituent sherb spectra ) , and @xmath95 is the size of the energy range ( @xmath96 kev ) . both @xmath90 and @xmath93 are accumulated over @xmath95 .",
    "the factor of @xmath97 converts the snr from a ratio using the counts over an energy range ( @xmath95 will vary in size from detector to detector and burst to burst ) to a ratio using the counts per kev . note that a livetime correction is not made .",
    "thus the database need contain parameters only for each sherb spectrum , as discussed in detail below .    for a burst to be included in our database it had to have a peak count rate in the large area detectors ( lads ) over @xmath987,500 s@xmath99 in the 50300  kev energy band ; of the 1550 bursts on which batse triggered between 1991 april and 1996 may , 297 met this criterion . after identifying the channels between 25 and 35  kev",
    ", we extracted the number of counts in these channels for each sherb spectrum for all the detectors that provided data .",
    "the background counting rate is the time average from a series of sherb spectra after the burst , if available , and sher spectra ( spectroscopy detector high energy resolution  background spectra accumulated when batse is not in burst mode ) before and after the burst , if necessary .",
    "calculating higher accuracy backgrounds is unnecessary for our purposes since here we only need a measure of the strength of the burst , not an accurate background - subtracted spectrum for spectral fitting . in some cases the calculated background was clearly too high  indicated by a large number of negative background - subtracted count rates  or low  found by inspecting weak bursts with large snrs .",
    "incorrect background rates were recalculated , often using stretches of background in the middle of , or just after , a burst .",
    "a burst for which the snr is sensitive to the background level is usually too weak to harbor detectable spectral lines .",
    "spectra from all detectors were included in the database , but we ignored data from detectors set at low gain or with burst angles greater than @xmath100 : low gain detectors have a low energy cutoff @xmath101 above the energies at which lines have been observed , and the spacecraft shields the detectors for very large burst angles .",
    "line detectability depends on the energy range covered ; a line at 20  kev will not be detected if the spectrum begins at 20  kev .",
    "therefore we also characterized each spectrum by its low energy edge @xmath101 , which we define as the upper end of the sled ( an electronic artifact just above a spectrum s true low energy cutoff ",
    "band et al .",
    "the database therefore consists of the following data for each detector for each burst : the time interval over which the sherb spectra were accumulated ; the number of counts in the 2535  kev range for each sherb spectrum ; and additional information for each burst - detector pair such as the burst angle , the energy @xmath101 of the upper end of the sled , and the exact energy width @xmath95 of the 2535  kev range .",
    "the product of the methodology and database described above is the probability for each burst of detecting a line if present @xmath102 .",
    "the primary purpose of this probability is to assess the consistency between batse and other missions , and to estimate the frequency with which lines occur .",
    "however , this probability can also be used to identify the bursts in which lines are most detectable .",
    "our search should therefore focus on those bursts . as an example , we characterized each burst by the maximum snr for any spectrum during the burst .",
    "figure  1 presents the cumulative distribution . since the gain , and thus the energy range included in the spectrum , varies from burst to burst and detector to detector , we show distributions by maximum @xmath101 .",
    "thus a line at 20  kev would be detectable in those bursts with a detector for which @xmath103  kev . from paper",
    "iii we find that the gb  880205 line set ( 19.4 and 38.8  kev ) would have been detected half the time by batse for snr@xmath104 .",
    "the line at 38.8  kev appears to determine the detectability of this line set in the batse spectra , and therefore we require @xmath105  kev .",
    "we see that the line at @xmath2  kev would have been detectable in the highest snr spectrum in about 65 bursts .",
    "the bayesian consistency measures and related quantities require @xmath16 , the probability of obtaining the observed results @xmath14 assuming a hypothesis @xmath15 about bursts and the detectors ( paper  ii ) ; @xmath18 is also known as the likelihood for @xmath17 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus @xmath14 might represent the absence of a batse line detection or the  line detections in specific bursts , while @xmath15 might stand for the hypothesis that lines exist , the batse detectors are modeled correctly , and the batse and  results are consistent . in our formulation",
    "we explicitly separate out the line frequency @xmath17 .",
    "a burst with a detection contributes to @xmath106 a factor of @xmath107 , while a burst with no line detection contributes @xmath108 .",
    "note that as before roman and greek indices specify spectra and bursts , respectively .",
    "thus , if there are line detections in @xmath109 bursts in a database of @xmath19 bursts then @xmath110 where the detections have been placed at the beginning of the database .",
    "the line frequency @xmath17 is not a quantity of interest to the consistency issue , and therefore it is `` marginalized , '' @xmath111 the `` prior '' for @xmath17 , @xmath112 , is our assessment of the likely value of @xmath17 before the data @xmath14 were obtained . in general",
    "we assume that @xmath17 could be any value between 0 and 1 , and therefore @xmath113 .",
    "we saw in  2 that @xmath114 ( e.g. , eqs . [ 8 ] , [ 10 ] or [ 12 ] ) .",
    "consequently the probabilities of detecting a line in a given burst @xmath22 and of obtaining the observed database @xmath106 are complicated functions of @xmath17 .",
    "thus the integral over @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( 15 ) will be a time - consuming numerical calculation since information from all the bursts must be included in evaluating the integrand at each value of @xmath17 .",
    "however , we can make some simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume the false positive probability @xmath28 is very small and can be neglected .",
    "second , the absence of a detection in the batse dataset indicates that the line frequency @xmath17 is probably small , and therefore @xmath115 consequently : @xmath116 f \\quad , \\\\",

    "we approximated @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( 19 ) for the case of no detections , which is currently relevant for batse ( i.e. , @xmath118 in eq .",
    "the quantity @xmath119 is the sum of each burst s detection probability ; thus @xmath119 will be nearly equal to the number of bursts if all bursts are uniformly strong , whereas weak bursts will not contribute to this statistic .",
    "since @xmath119 is the first order expansion in @xmath17 , it is valid for small values of @xmath17 , i.e. , under the assumption that a line is unlikely to be present in a given burst .",
    "the small @xmath17 approximation in eq .",
    "( 19 ) is valid only for @xmath120 ; note that @xmath121 is not accurate for @xmath122 even if @xmath123 is small .",
    "however we shall use this approximation to @xmath124 .",
    "we can now marginalize @xmath17 to obtain @xmath125 where we set @xmath126 for @xmath127 . using the expression in paper  ii for the probability distribution for @xmath17",

    "( 16 ) to the regime @xmath130 where the approximation will have broken down . in figure  2",
    "we compare @xmath131 in eq .",
    "( 22 ) to @xmath132 which results from the absence of a line detection in @xmath133 bursts in which lines could have been detected with 100% probability ( i.e. , @xmath134 ) . as can be seen , the small @xmath17 approximation is accurate to a factor of @xmath135 in normalization and extent . given the uncertainties and other approximations in this analysis , this accuracy is sufficient . in part , the small @xmath17 approximation demonstrates the utility of @xmath136 as a diagnostic statistic .",
    "the quantity @xmath136 characterizes the detectability of spectral lines in a burst database and thus our ability to learn about lines from the database .",
    "primarily , @xmath136 is the approximate number of bursts in which lines could be detected .",
    "we have seen that its inverse is twice @xmath137 , the likelihood of the hypothesis @xmath15 and that it is the width of the distribution for the line frequency @xmath17 . using the burst database described in  3 we calculated @xmath138 for the batse spectra .",
    "since the burst distribution  the frequency of lines of different types and where within the burst they occur  is unknown , we made a number of modeling assumptions .",
    "these assumptions , along with the supposition that lines exist and that the modeling of the batse detectors is correct , constitute the hypothesis @xmath15 .",
    "first , we assume that the line frequency @xmath17 is the same for all bursts , and that a line can occur in any spectrum with equal probability ( the second variant of model  1 in  2 ) .",
    "thus we use eq .",
    "( 8) to define @xmath139 , i.e. , @xmath140 .",
    "second , we approximate @xmath27 , the probability of detecting a line in a spectrum , as 1 for snrs above a threshold value if the low energy cutoff is less than a certain energy . in paper",
    "iii we found that this probability @xmath141 was a function of both the snr and the burst angle , and that the transition from 0 to 1 occurs over a range of snr .",
    "the calculations in paper  iii assumed a low energy cutoff of 10  kev which is rarely achieved because of the sled electronic artifact which raises the effective cutoff ( band et al .",
    "1992 ) and the gain settings of the sds . however , in band et al .",
    "( 1996 , henceforth paper  iv ) we showed that the detectability of a line is insensitive to the low energy cutoff as long as sufficient continuum is included below the line candidate ( in the example there 1520  kev ) .",
    "we have been using the two  detections to characterize the unknown line distribution . for the line at 21.1  kev in the s1 segment of gb  870303",
    "the transition between a detection probability of 0 and 1 occurs at a snr of @xmath135 , while for the harmonic lines in gb  880205 at 19.4 and 38.8  kev the transition occurs at a snr of @xmath142 ; in both cases the detectability is also angle dependent .",
    "however , for greater generality we present in figure  4 @xmath136 for a range of snrs and low energy cutoffs . as can be seen , @xmath143 for detecting lines similar to the one in gb  870303 , assuming a low energy cutoff of 15  kev will suffice .",
    "if the detectability of the gb  880205 lines is dominated by the 38.6  kev line ( see figure  1 of paper  iii ) , and thus a low energy cutoff less than 25  kev is necessary , then @xmath144 .",
    "it is clear from these curves that despite the large number of bursts observed by batse in the past 5 years , lines would be detectable in relatively few bursts .    only for the rare strong bursts are lines detectable in spectra accumulated by  and the batse sds . since batse detects bursts with a much larger detector than the sds , whereas  detected bursts with the same detector which accumulated spectra , the batse burst database includes a larger fraction of weak bursts .",
    "in addition ,  reported lines at @xmath1 and @xmath2  kev .",
    "the  burst detector was sensitive down to 2  kev ( murakami et al .",
    "1989 ) whereas batse s @xmath101 is typically @xmath9820  kev . on the other hand",
    ", each batse sd has an area twice that of the  detector .",
    "therefore batse is usually less sensitive than  to lines below @xmath2  kev , and more sensitive above 40  kev .",
    "the necessary  data has not yet been extracted to complete the study of the consistency between the batse and  observations as presented in paper  ii . however , the small values of @xmath145 for the batse bursts and the preliminary value of @xmath146 for a  detection of lines similar to the one in gb  880205 ( fenimore et al .",
    "1993 ) , indicate that the apparent discrepancy between batse and  is not severe .",
    "for example , the probability that the one detection of a line similar to gb  880205 occurred in the  bursts and not in the batse data is ( papers i and  ii ) @xmath147 , which is hardly an improbable event .",
    "we now have a methodology which provides the probability for detecting a line in the bursts observed by batse .",
    "this probability can be used to evaluate the consistency between the line detections and nondetections by batse and other burst missions , estimate the frequency with which lines occur , and identify bursts in which lines are likely to be discovered by new search techniques .",
    "the new element in the methodology is the weighting of the probabilities for detecting a line in each of the spectra spanning the burst which can be formed from the sherb spectra provided by the telemetry .",
    "this weighting is model - dependent ; we explored three models where the line occurrence depends only on the time a line persists .",
    "implementing this methodology requires parameter values characterizing each spectrum in the bursts under consideration . to this end",
    "we built a database of the necessary information .",
    "we have been using this database to identify the bursts in which lines may be detected .",
    "we calculated the number of bursts in which lines of various types , as parameterized by the minimum snr and maximum low energy cutoff necessary for a detection , could have been detected if the lines were indeed present .",
    "this calculation assumes a small line frequency .",
    "these quantities are necessary for the probability that no lines would be detected in the batse data and for the distribution for the line frequency , and therefore these numbers are essential for measures of the consistency between the batse and  line observations .",
    "-like lines can be detected in relatively few of the large number of bursts batse has observed ; for example , lines similar to the gb  880205 pair of lines are detectable in only @xmath1 batse bursts .",
    "although comparable  data is not yet available , the discrepancy between  and batse does not appear to be severe .",
    "for example , a simple calculation shows that the probability that the gb  880205 line set would be detected in a  burst is 20% , which is hardly improbable .",
    "finally , to evaluate the significance of line candidates we have adopted the maximum likelihood ratio test which is more appropriate than the @xmath35-test .",
    "the @xmath35-test should be used when the uncertainties on the datapoints are unknown .",
    "these two tests give similar significances when the reduced @xmath148 is of order unity .",
    "indeed , we find little change in the significances given by the two tests for the line candidates identified by the visual search of batse spectra .",
    "we thank c.  graziani , d.  lamb , and t.  loredo for insightful discussion about statistics .",
    "we are grateful for the detailed comments of the referee , a.  connors .",
    "the work of the ucsd group is supported by nasa contract nas8 - 36081 .",
    "to evaluate the significance of a given spectral feature we have been using the @xmath35-test which compares fits with nested models ( i.e. , one model is a subset of the other ) .",
    "assume that @xmath149 results from fitting a spectrum of @xmath150 channels by a continuum model with @xmath151 parameters ( thus @xmath152 degrees - of - freedom ) , and that @xmath153 results from fitting the spectrum by a continuum+line(s ) model with @xmath154 parameters ( @xmath155 degrees - of - freedom ) .",
    "in the continuum+line(s ) model , the @xmath151 continuum parameters are the same as for the continuum model ; thus an additional @xmath156 parameters have been added by modeling the line(s ) .",
    "if the continuum model is correct and there are actually no lines then the quantity @xmath157 is distributed as @xmath158 .",
    "consequently @xmath159 is the probability of finding @xmath35 larger than or equal to @xmath160 when a continuum+line(s ) model is fit to a count spectrum resulting from a photon spectrum correctly described by the continuum model .",
    "thus this is the probability that the improvement in @xmath148 by adding the additional @xmath161 line parameters is a fluctuation .",
    "the @xmath35-test we have been using is based on a maximum likelihood ratio test where the uncertainties are unknown .",
    "the original version defines @xmath148 without uncertainties , @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the observed value and @xmath164 is the model value .",
    "then @xmath165 is distributed as @xmath166 ( eadie et al .",
    "1971 , p. 238 ) .",
    "since @xmath150 is large , there is little difference between @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "both @xmath160 and @xmath169 use ratios of @xmath148 and @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "thus the @xmath35 statistic eliminates the effect of a systematic multiplicative error in the uncertainties used in @xmath148 or of an unknown constant uncertainty on the datapoints in @xmath170 .",
    "this demonstrates why the @xmath35-test is appropriate for the case where the uncertainties are not known .    however , we find that the uncertainties in our data result predominantly if not exclusively from counting statistics , and consequently the uncertainties are known .",
    "thus we can use the fundamental maximum likelihood ratio test ( mlrt ) from which the @xmath35-test is derived .",
    "this test states that @xmath171 is distributed as @xmath172 if the continuum model is sufficient and no lines are present ( eadie et al .",
    "1971 , pp .",
    "230237 ) . as with the @xmath35-test",
    ", a small value of @xmath173 indicates a small probability that the continuum model alone describes the data . in figure  4",
    "we compare the mlrt to the @xmath35-test ( using the @xmath160 statistic of eq .  [ a1 ] ) for the same values of @xmath174 and different values of the reduced @xmath148 , @xmath175 .",
    "as figure  4 shows , the two tests give the same values for @xmath176 slightly less than 1 , which is not surprising since we expect @xmath177 if our spectral model is correct .",
    "a value of @xmath176 which differs significantly from 1 may result from an incorrect value for the uncertainties used in @xmath148 , which the @xmath35-test attempts to correct . however , other factors may cause @xmath176 to differ from unity , such as an incorrect continuum model and inaccuracies in the detector response model and the energy calibration .",
    "this is a major reason to favor the mlrt . to determine the continuum from which a candidate line deviates",
    ", we include all the spectral data , including continuum far from the line .",
    "however , we do not know the true continuum shape , which might raise @xmath176 . also , the @xmath35-test depends on the total number of datapoints ( the @xmath35 statistic has a distribution which is a function of the number of degrees - of - freedom ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the mlrt is a function of the number of added parameters @xmath161 .    in most cases",
    "the mlrt and the @xmath35-test will lead to the same conclusion as to whether a feature is significant . indeed , evaluating the line candidates from the visual search of batse sd spectra with the mlrt as opposed to the @xmath35-test ( which was used in paper  iv )",
    "does not lead to a qualitative difference in significance .",
    "figure  5 compares the probabilities given by these two tests .",
    "as concluded in paper  iv , none of the line candidates is significant .",
    "the following is a list of the symbols used in this paper .",
    "@xmath17the frequency with which a line type is present in any burst .",
    "the use of @xmath17 assumes that each burst , regardless of its characteristics , has the same probability of hosting the line type .",
