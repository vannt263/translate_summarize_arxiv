    "the dirac equation is a fundamental base of the relativistic field theory .",
    "however , it is an important model in the non - relativistic solid state theory as well .",
    "superconductors with @xmath0pairing @xcite , the cohen - blount two - band model of narrow - gap semiconductors @xcite , @xcite , electronic spectrum of the carbon tubes form an incomplete list of the non - relativistic applications of this equation . during the last two years",
    "extremely much attention was payed to the problem of the electronic spectrum of graphene ( see for the review @xcite ) .",
    "two - dimensional structure of it and a presence of the cone points in the electronic spectrum make actual a comprehensive study of the external fields effect on the spectrum and other characteristics of the electronic states described by the dirac equation in the 2 + 1 space - time .",
    "we consider in this work the bound states of the 2 + 1 dirac equation due to the short - range perturbation .",
    "particular attention to this case stems from the effectiveness of short - range scatterers in contrast to the long - range ones : an effect of the latter is suppressed by the klein paradox @xcite .",
    "our work takes into account the obvious fact that the kohn - luttinger matrix elements of the short - range perturbation calculated on the upper and lower band wave functions are not equal in a general case .",
    "this means that in the perturbed dirac equation not only the potential but the mass perturbation can be present .",
    "the dirac equation describing electronic states in graphene reads @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the limiting velocity of the band electrons , @xmath3 are the pauli matrices , @xmath4 is the electronic spectrum gap , @xmath5 is the two - component spinor .",
    "the spinor structure takes into account the two - band nature.@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the local perturbations of the mass ( gap ) and the chemical potential .",
    "a local mass perturbation can be induced by defects in the graphene film or in the substrate @xcite .",
    "we consider here the delta function model of the perturbation:@xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the polar coordinate radius and the perturbation radius .",
    "such short - range perturbation ( and the equivalent form @xmath11 with @xmath12 ) was used in the ( 3 + 1)-dirac problem for narrow - gap and zero - gap semiconductors in @xcite . the two - dimensional dirac problem with the scalar short - range perturbation ( [ delta ] ) ( but without the mass perturbation )",
    "was considered in @xcite .",
    "the obtained there characteristic equation for the discrete spectrum energy contains one mistake .",
    "we correct it here and take account of the mass perturbation @xmath13    let us present the two - component spinor in the form@xmath14 \\\\ g_{j}\\left (   r\\right )   \\exp\\left [   i\\left (   j+1/2\\right )   \\phi\\right ] \\end{pmatrix } , \\label{spinor}%\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the pseudospin quantum number ; @xmath16 . in the opposite to the relativistic theory , this quantum number has nothing to do with the real spin and indicates the degeneracy in the biconic dirac point .",
