    "a classical cryptographic communication system .    a message , called * plaintext * @xmath0 , is encrypted via a secret * key * @xmath1 into * ciphertext * @xmath2 , sent over a non - secure communication channel , and finally decrypted via a secret * key * @xmath3 back into readable plaintext @xmath0 . following the conventions of the cryptographic literature",
    ", we will refer to the transmitter as * alice * , to the receiver as * bob * , and to an adversarial eavesdropper as * eve*.    there are classical cryptographic systems which are * perfectly secure * ( see @xcite ) , such as the * vernam cipher * , better know as the * one time pad * , which uses a perfectly random key @xmath1 equal in length to the length of the message .",
    "the chief practical difficulty with such perfectly secure systems is that alice must first communicate a random key in secret via some totally secure channel . in most cases , the length of the key makes this secure communication impractical and too costly . because of the large cost of transmitting such long keys over a secure channel , alice is frequently tempted to use the same key twice .",
    "if she makes this fatal mistake , then her ciphertext immediately changes from being perfectly secure to ciphertext that is easily read by eve .",
    "thus , for almost all practical cryptographic systems , the key @xmath1 is substantially shorter than the length of the plaintext . as a result ,",
    "the ciphertext is no longer perfectly secure .",
    "however , if the encryption method and key @xmath1 are wisely chosen , then alice s communication to bob will be * practically secure*. by `` practically secure , '' we mean that , although adversary eve is theoretically able to decrypt alice and bob s communication without any knowledge of their key , she can not do so because the required computational time and resources are simply beyond her capability and means .",
    "the * data encryption standard ( des ) * is believed to be an example of such a practically secure encryption system .",
    "( see for example @xcite . )    in any case , one achilles heal of classical cryptographic communication systems is that secret communication can only take place after a key is communicated in secret over a totally secure communication channel .",
    "this is frequently referred to as the `` catch 22 '' of cryptography , i.e. ,       * catch 22 * : before alice and bob can communicate in secret , they must first communicate in secret .",
    "there is even more to this catch 22 , namely :       * catch 22a * : even if alice and bob somehow succeed in communicating their key over a secure communication channel , there is simply no classical cryptographic mechanism guaranteeing with total certainty that their key was transmitted securely , i.e. , that their `` secure '' communication channel is free of eve s unauthorized intrusion .",
    "as we shall see , quantum encryption does provide a means of circumventing this impasse of intrusion detection .       a proposed solution to the catch 22 of classical cryptographic communication systems",
    "is the modern * public key cryptographic system * ( * pkcs * ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "( see @xcite @xcite . )    for public key cryptographic systems , it is no longer necessary for alice and bob to exchange key over a secure channel . instead , alice and bob both create their own individual encryption / decryption key pairs @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "then they both keep their decryption keys @xmath6 and @xmath7 secret from everyone , including each other , and `` publish '' or publicly broadcast their encryption keys @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the entire world to see .",
    "the security of such a public key cryptographic system depends on the selection of an encryption / decryption algorithm which is a * trapdoor function*. as a result , recovering the decryption key from the encryption key is computationally infeasible .",
    "the rsa public key cryptographic system is believed to be an example of such a cryptographic system .",
    "( see for example @xcite . )",
    "fig2.ps + figure 2 . a public key cryptographic communication system .",
    "one major drawback to public key cryptographic systems is that no one has yet been able to prove that practical trapdoor functions exist . as a result ,",
    "no one is really sure how secure such public key cryptographic systems are .",
    "moreover , if researchers succeed in building a feasible quantum computer , shor s quantum factoring algorithm @xcite could break rsa easily , i.e. , in polynomial time .",
    "yet another drawback to public key cryptographic systems is that , in terms of some everyday implementations , such systems frequently do not circumvent the catch 22 of classical cryptography after all .",
    "the keys for many practical public key cryptographic systems are frequently managed by a * key bank * that is independent of alice and bob .",
    "thus , secret communications over a secure channel from the key bank to alice and bob are required before alice and bob can secretly communicate .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the most important contribution of quantum cryptography is a mechanism for detecting eavesdropping .",
    "this is a totally new contribution to the field of cryptography .",
    "neither classical cryptographic systems nor public key cryptographic systems have such a capability . in the next section",
    ", we will see how quantum mechanics provides a means for detecting intrusion .",
    "the recent results in quantum cryptography are based on the * heisenberg uncertainty principle * of quantum mechanics . using standard dirac notation ,",
    "this principle can be succinctly stated as follows :    * heisenberg uncertainty principle : * for any two quantum mechanical * observables * @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12   \\right\\rangle \\right\\|   ^{2}\\text{,}%\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and where @xmath14   = ab - ba\\text{.}%\\ ] ]    thus , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are variances which measure the uncertainty of observables @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for *",
    "incompatible * observables , i.e. , for observables @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that @xmath17 \\neq0 $ ] , reducing the uncertainty @xmath18 of @xmath10 forces the uncertainty @xmath19 of @xmath11 to increase , and vice versa . thus the observables @xmath10 and @xmath11 can not be simultaneously measured to arbitrary precision .",
    "measuring one of the observables interferes with the measurement of the other .",
    "young s double slit experiment is an example suggesting how heisenberg s uncertainty principle could be used for detecting eavesdropping in a cryptographic communications . this experiment is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 .    fig3.ps + figure 3 .",
    "young s double slit experiment when electron trajectories are not observed .",
    "the first of two incompatible observables is measured .",
    "an electron gun randomly emits electrons over a fairly large angular spread . in front of the gun",
    "is a metal wall with two small slits . beyond",
    "the wall is a backstop that absorbs the electrons that pass through the two slits .",
    "the probability density pattern of the absorbed electrons is described by the curves @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 which , for the convenience of the reader , have been drawn behind the backstop .",
    "the curve @xmath20 denotes the probability density pattern if only slit 1 is open .",
    "the curve @xmath21 denotes the probability density pattern if only slit 2 is open .",
    "finally , the curve @xmath23 denotes the probability density pattern if both slits 1 and 2 are open .",
    "thus , @xmath23 shows a quantum mechanical interference pattern demonstrating the wave nature of electrons .",
    "fig4.ps + figure 4 .",
    "young s double slit experiment when electron trajectories are observed by eve .",
    "the second of two incompatible observables is measured .    comparing this with our description of a classical cryptographic system",
    ", the electron gun can be thought of as the transmitter alice . and the interference pattern @xmath23 can be thought of as the message received by bob . if however , eve tries to eavesdrop by trying to detect through which slit each electron passes , as illustrated in fig",
    "4 , the interference pattern @xmath23 is destroyed and replaced by the bell curve @xmath24 ( which is a classical superposition of curves @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) drawn in fig .",
    "4 , thus demonstrating the particle nature of the electron . as a result",
    ", bob knows with certainty that eve is eavesdropping in on his communication with alice .",
    "bob knows that , because of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , both the wave and particle natures of the electron can not be simultaneously detected .       in the next sections ,",
    "we describe a number of methods , i.e. , * quantum cryptographic communication protocols * , that utilize the heisenberg uncertainty principle to communicate random binary sequences ( i.e. , keys ) with automatic eavesdrop detection .",
    "these quantum communication protocols provide a means of circumventing the `` catch 22 '' of classical cryptographic systems . as a result ,",
    "the perfect security of the vernam cipher ( i.e. , one - time - pad ) is an inexpensively implementable reality .",
    "all the quantum cryptographic systems we discuss in this paper can be implemented by transmissions over fiber optic cable of individual photons , each with a single bit encoded in its quantum mechanical state space .",
    "we describe all of these systems in terms of the polarization states of a single photon . it should be noted that they could equally well be described in terms of any two - state quantum system .",
    "examples of such a system include a spin-@xmath27 particle , and a two - state level atom .",
    "the quantum cryptographic protocols discussed will of necessity use some encoding scheme ( or schemes ) which associates the bits @xmath28 and @xmath29 with distinct quantum states .",
    "we call such an association a * quantum alphabet*. should the associated states be orthogonal , we call the encoding scheme an * orthogonal quantum alphabet*.",
    "the first quantum cryptographic communication protocol , called * bb84 * , was invented in 1984 by bennett and brassard @xcite .",
    "this protocol has been experimentally demonstrated to work for a transmission over 30 km of fiber optic cable @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , and also over free space for a distance of over one hundred meters@xcite @xcite . it is speculated , but not yet experimentally verified , that the bb84 protocol should be implementable over distances of at least 100 km .    in this section",
    "we describe the bb84 protocol in a noise free environment . in the next section ,",
    "we extend the protocol to one in which noise is considered .",
    "we now describe the bb84 protocol in terms of the polarization states of a single photon .",
    "please note that the bb84 protocol could equally well be described in terms of any other two - state quantum system .",
    "let @xmath30 be the two dimensional hilbert space whose elements representate the polarization states of a single photon .",
    "in describing bb84 , we use two different orthogonal bases of @xmath30 .",
    "they are the * circular polarization basis * , which consists of the kets @xmath31 for * right * and * left circular polarization states * , respectively , and the * linear polarization basis * which consists of the kets @xmath32 for * vertical * and * horizontal linear polarization states * , respectively .",
    "the bb84 protocol utilizes any two incompatible orthogonal quantum alphabets in the hilbert space @xmath30 . for our description of bb84",

    "eve could intercept alice s transmission with 100% accuracy , and then imitate alice by retransmitting her measurements to bob .",
    "if , for example , alice used only the orthogonal quantum alphabet @xmath36 , then eve could measure each bit of alice s transmission with a device based on some circular polarization measurement operator such as @xmath37 or if , alice used only the orthogonal quantum alphabet @xmath35 , then eve could measure each transmitted bit with a device based on some linear polarization measurement operator such as @xmath38 the above strategy used by eve is called * opaque eavesdropping * @xcite .",
    "( we will consider other and more sophisticated eavesdropping strategies later . )       to assure the detection of eve s eavesdropping , bennett and brassard require alice and bob to communicate in two stages , the first stage over a one - way quantum communication channel from alice to bob , the second stage over a two - way public communication channel .",
    "( please refer to figure 5 . )            in the first stage , alice is required , each time she transmits a single bit , to use randomly with equal probability one of the two orthogonal alphabets @xmath36 or @xmath39 .",
    "since no measurement operator of @xmath36 is compatible with any measurement operator of @xmath39 , it follows from the heisenberg uncertainty principle that no one , not even bob or eve , can receive alice s transmission with an accuracy greater than 75% .",
    "fig5.ps + figure 5 . a quantum cryptographic communication system for securely transfering random key",
    "this can be seen as follows . for each bit transmitted by alice",
    ", one can choose a measurement operator compatible with either @xmath36 or @xmath39 , but not both .",
    "because of incompatibility , there is no simultaneous measurement operator for both @xmath36 and @xmath39 .",
    "since one has no knowledge of alice s secret choice of quantum alphabet , 50% of the time ( i.e. , with probability @xmath40 ) one will guess correctly , i.e. , choose a measurement operator compatible with alice s choice , and 50% of the time ( i.e. , with probability @xmath40 ) one will guess incorrectly .",
    "if one guesses correctly , then alice s transmitted bit is received with probability @xmath29 . on the other hand , if one guesses incorrectly , then alice s transmitted bit is received correctly with probability @xmath40 . thus in general , the probability of correctly receiving alice s transmitted bit is @xmath41       for each bit transmitted by alice , we assume that eve performs one of two actions , opaque eavesdropping with probability @xmath42 , @xmath43 , or no eavesdropping with probability @xmath44 .",
    "thus , if @xmath45 , eve is eavesdropping on each transmitted bit ; and if @xmath46 , eve is not eavesdropping at all .       because bob s and eve s choice of measurement operators are stochastically independent of each other and of alice s choice of alphabet , eve s eavesdropping has an immediate and detectable impact on bob s received bits .",
    "eve s eavesdropping causes bob s error rate to jump from @xmath47 to @xmath48 thus , if eve eavesdrops on every bit , i.e. , if @xmath45 , then bob s error rate jumps from @xmath47 to @xmath49 , a 50% increase .         in stage 2 ,",
    "alice and bob communicate in two phases over a public channel to check for eve s presence by analyzing bob s error rate .",
    "phase 1 of stage 2 is dedicated to eliminating the bit locations ( and hence the bits at these locations ) at which error could have occurred without eves eavesdropping .",
    "bob begins by publicly communicating to alice which measurement operators he used for each of the received bits .",
    "alice then in turn publicly communicates to bob which of his measurement operator choices were correct .",
    "after this two way communication , alice and bob delete the bits corresponding to the incompatible measurement choices to produce shorter sequences of bits which we call respectively * alice s raw key * and * bob s raw key*.    if there is no intrusion , then alice s and bob s raw keys will be in total agreement .",
    "however , if eve has been at work , then corresponding bits of alice s and bob s raw keys will not agree with probability @xmath50         alice and bob now initiate a two way conversation over the public channel to test for eve s presence .    in the absence of noise , any discrepancy between alice s and bob s raw keys is proof of eve s intrusion .",
    "so to detect eve , alice and bob select a publicly agreed upon random subset of @xmath51 bit locations in the raw key , and publicly compare corresponding bits , making sure to discard from raw key each bit as it is revealed .",
    "should at least one comparison reveal an inconsistency , then eve s eavesdropping has been detected , in which case alice and bob return to stage 1 and start over .",
    "on the other hand , if no inconsistencies are uncovered , then the probability that eve escapes detection is : @xmath52 for example , if @xmath45 and @xmath53 , then @xmath54 thus , if @xmath55 is sufficiently small , alice and bob agree that eve has not eavesdropped , and accordingly adopt the remnant raw key as their * final secret key*.",
    "in this section , the bb84 protocol is extended to a noisy environment . since , in a noisy environment , alice and bob can not distinguish between error caused by noise and error caused by eve s eavesdropping , they must and do adopt the assumption that all errors in raw key are caused by eve .       as before , there are two stages to the protocol .",
    "this stage is exactly the same as before , except that errors are now also induced by noise .         in stage 2 ,",
    "alice and bob communicate over a public channel in four phases .",
    "phase 1 is dedicated to * raw key * extraction , phase 2 to * error estimation * , phase 3 to * reconciliation * , i.e. , to * reconciled key * extraction , and phase 4 to * privacy amplification * , i.e. , extraction of * final secret key*.         this stage is the same as before , except alice and bob also delete those bit locations at which bob should have received but did not receive a bit .",
    "such `` non - receptions '' could be caused by eve s intrusion or by dark counts in bob s detecting device .",
    "the location of the dark counts are , of course , communicated by bob to alice over the public channel .",
    "alice and bob now use the public channel to estimate the error rate in raw key .",
    "they publicly select and agree upon a random sample of raw key , publicly compare these bits to obtain an estimate @xmath56 of the error - rate .",
    "these revealed bits are discarded from raw key .",
    "if @xmath56 exceeds a certain threshold @xmath57 , then it will be impossible for alice and bob to arrive at a common secret key .",
    "if so , alice and bob return to stage 1 to start over . on the other hand , if the error estimate @xmath56 does not exceed @xmath57 , then alice and bob move onto phase 3 .         in phase 3 ,",
    "alice and bob s objective is to remove all errors from what remains of raw key to produce an error free common key , called * reconciled key*. this phase is of course called * reconciliation * , and takes place in two steps @xcite .    in step 1 , alice and bob publicly agree upon a random permutation , and apply it to what remains of their respective raw keys .",
    "next alice and bob partition the remnant raw key into blocks of length @xmath58 , where the length @xmath58 is chosen so that blocks of this length are unlikely to contain more than one error . for",
    "each of these blocks , alice and bob publicly compare overall parity checks , making sure each time to discard the last bit of the compared block . each time a overall parity check does not agree , alice and bob initiate a binary search for the error , i.e. , bisecting the block into two subblocks , publicly comparing the parities for each of these subblocks , discarding the right most bit of each subblock .",
    "they continue their bisective search on the subblock for which their parities are not in agreement .",
    "this bisective search continues until the erroneous bit is located and deleted .",
    "they then continue to the next @xmath58-block .",
    "step 1 is repeated , i.e. , a random permutation is chosen , remnant raw key is partitioned into blocks of length @xmath58 , parities are compared , etc .",
    "this is done until it becomes inefficient to continue in this fashion .",
    "alice and bob then move to step 2 by using a more refined reconciliation procedure .",
    "they publicly select randomly chosen subsets of remnant raw key , publicly compare parities , each time discarding an agreed upon bit from their chosen key sample .",
    "if a parity should not agree , they employ the binary search strategy of step 1 to locate and delete the error .    finally , when , for some fixed number @xmath59 of consecutive repetitions of step 2 , no error is found , alice and bob assume that to a very high probability , the remnant raw key is without error .",
    "alice and bob now rename the remnant raw key * *  reconciled key * * , and move on to the final and last phase of their communication .",
    "alice and bob now have a common reconciled key which they know is only partially secret from eve .",
    "they now begin the process of * privacy amplification * , which is the extraction of a secret key from a partially secret one @xcite @xcite .    based on their error estimate @xmath56 , alice and",
    "bob obtain an upper bound @xmath60 of the number of bits known by eve of their @xmath61 bits of reconciled key .",
    "let @xmath62 be a security parameter that alice and bob adjust as desired .",
    "they then publicly select @xmath63 random subsets of reconciled key , without revealing their contents , and without revealing their parities .",
    "the undisclosed parities become the common * final secret key*. it can be shown that eve s average information about the final secret key is less than @xmath64 bits .",
    "unfortunately , there is no known way to initiate authentication without initially exchanging secret key over a secure communication channel .",
    "so , quantum protocols have not entirely overcome the `` catch 22 '' of classical cryptography .",
    "however , this secret key exchange for authentication need only be done once .",
    "thereafter , a portion of the secure key communicated via a quantum protocol can be used for authentication .",
    "as with the bb84 quantum protocol , the b92 protocol @xcite can be described in terms of any quantum system represented by a two dimensional hilbert space . for our description , we choose the two dimensional hilbert space @xmath30 representing the polarization states of a single photon .",
    "b92 can be implemented in terms of any non - orthogonal basis .",
    "we choose as our non - orthogonal basis the kets @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote respectively the kets representing the polarization state of a photon linearly polarized at an angle @xmath68 and an angle @xmath69 with respect to the vertical , where @xmath70 .",
    "unlike bb84 which requires two orthogonal quantum alphabets , b92 requires only a single non - orthogonal quantum alphabet .",

    "alice uses the quantum alphabet @xmath71 to send her random binary sequence to bob .",
    "since @xmath66 and @xmath72 are not orthogonal , there is no one experiment that will unambiguously distinguish between these two polarization states .",
    "bob can use one of many possible measurement strategies .",
    "bennett @xcite suggests the measurements be based on the two incompatible experiments corresponding to the projection operators @xmath73 in this case , bob either correctly detects alice s transmitted bit , or an ambiguous result , i.e. , an * erasure * , denoted by `` @xmath74 '' . assuming that alice transmits 0 s and 1 s at random with equal probability and that , for each incoming bit , bob at random with equal probability chooses to base his experiment on either of the incompatible operators @xmath75 or @xmath76 , then the probability of bob s correctly receiving alice s transmission is @xmath77 and the probability of receiving an erasure is @xmath78 where @xmath79 and where @xmath70 .",
    "thus , bob receives more than 50% erasures .       on the other hand , ekert",
    "et al @xcite suggest a more efficient measurement process for bob .",
    "they suggest that bob base his experiments on the * positive operator valued measure * ( * povm * ) @xcite @xcite consisting of the operators @xmath80 with this more efficient detection method , the probability of an inconclusive result is now @xmath79 where again @xmath70 .",
    "stage2 for the b92 protocol is the same as that for the bb84 protocol except for phase 1 .       in phase 1 of stage 2 ,",
    "bob publicly informs alice as to which time slots he received non - erasures .",
    "the bits in these time slots become alice s and bob s raw keys .",
    "eve s presence is detected by an unusual error rate in bob s raw key .",
    "it is also possible to detect eve s presence by an unusual erasure rate for bob .",
    "however , ekert et al @xcite do point out that eve can choose eavesdropping strategies which have no effect on the erasure rate , and hence , can only be detected by unusual error rates in bob s raw key - state protocols with @xmath81 , eve s presence is always detectable from rejected key .",
    "see section 7 of this paper . ] .",
    "ekert in @xcite has devised a quantum protocol based on the properties of quantum - correlated particles .",
    "einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) in the their famous 1935 paper @xcite challenged the foundations of quantum mechanics by pointing out a `` paradox . '' there exist spatially separated pairs of particles , henceforth called * epr pairs * , whose states are correlated in such a way that the measurement of a chosen observable @xmath10 of one automatically determines the result of the measurement of @xmath10 of the other .",
    "since epr pairs can be pairs of particles separated at great distances , this leads to what appears to be a paradoxical `` action at a distance . ''",
    "for example , it is possible to create a pair of photons ( each of which we label below with the subscripts 1 and 2 , respectively ) with correlated linear polarizations .",
    "an example of such an entangled state is given by @xmath82 where the notation @xmath66 has been defined in the previous section .",
    "thus , if one photon is measured to be in the vertical linear polarization state @xmath83 , the other , when measured , will be found to be in the horizontal linear polarization state @xmath84 , and vice versa .",
    "einstein et al @xcite then state that such quantum correlation phenomena could be a strong indication that quantum mechanics is incomplete , and that there exist `` hidden variables , '' inaccessible to experiments , which explain such `` action at a distance . ''    in 1964 , bell @xcite gave a means for actually testing for * locally hidden variable * ( * lhv * ) theories .",
    "he proved that all such lhv theories must satisfy the * bell inequality*. quantum mechanics has been shown to violate the inequality .",
