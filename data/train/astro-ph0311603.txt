    "since the discovery of @xmath4 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs  @xcite ) , many efforts are being made to select the whole population of star - forming galaxies at the highest possible redshifts ( see  @xcite for a review ) , and to constrain the star formation history of the universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of @xmath5 galaxies allows to study the modes of early galaxy formation and the interplay between the first galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the redshift range @xmath6 is a very intriguing time during cosmic evolution , when hydrogen reionization is believed to be basically complete and the igm starts to be polluted with metals @xcite .    because a significant part of the bolometric luminosity of primeval star - forming objects escapes as ly@xmath0 emission , especially if dust is not yet ubiquitous , it seems profitable to search for the redshifted ly@xmath0 line of high redshift galaxies .",
    "the advent of ten meter class telescopes made this approach successful and efficient , and both narrow - band imaging and optical _ serendipitous _ spectroscopy found ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath7 @xcite . thanks to the recently increased sensitivity of ccds at @xmath8 m , the discovery of @xmath9 galaxies has also become possible . using narrow band filters sensitive to wavelengths in the range @xmath10 , i.e.  ly@xmath0 emission at @xmath11 and subsequent spectroscopy ,",
    "two groups have detected the first three galaxies known at @xmath5 .",
    "the first of these was found due to the strong lensing amplification ( 4.5 ) by the cluster abell 370  @xcite .",
    "the other two galaxies were found in a survey made with subaru suprime - cam instrument which provides a huge field of view ( 814 arcmin@xmath2  @xcite ) .",
    "we have used a new approach to search for ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath12 based on slitless spectroscopy in combination with a narrow band ( 2.2% ) filter and very deep imaging in a field with very low galactic extinction ( @xmath13=0.002 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 filter employed has a central wavelength of 9135  and fwhm of 200  and is therefore sensitive to ly@xmath0 at @xmath15 .",
    "the imaging was carried out through the @xmath14 filter ( to identify the sources of emission lines detected in the spectroscopy ) and the bessel @xmath16 filter ( to determine the @xmath17 colour or spectral break over the ly@xmath0 line ) .",
    "the observations were carried out with the fors2 instrument at the vlt during eight nights in october , november 2002 and february 2003 .",
    "total exposure times were 7.6 , 6.33 and 4.0 hours for the slitless spectroscopy , @xmath14 and @xmath16 band direct imaging , respectively .",
    "observing conditions were excellent resulting in 0.7 arcsec seeing on the resulting combined images .",
    "the field was also imaged earlier in bessel @xmath18 and gunn @xmath19 band .",
    "three authors ( jk , ac , ssa ) have independently searched for emission lines on the spectroscopic frame , resulting in a combined list of 161 emission lines .",
    "each emission line can originate from a counterpart on the direct image within a region of about 50@xmath20 .",
    "the emission lines are related to 345 possible counterparts in the @xmath14 image .",
    "four of these have @xmath21 , one of which is an [ oiii ] emitter at @xmath22 .",
    "this leaves three counterparts which may be ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , among the @xmath24 objects detected by sextractor on the @xmath14 image , there are ten other objects with these colours , which are considered lbg candidates at @xmath5 .",
    "the number of possible ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath3 detected in our field is consistent with the number densities of @xmath25 galaxies reported by other authors  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the recent subaru survey by  @xcite resulted in the detection of 73 ly@xmath0 candidates at @xmath3 ( with @xmath26 ) in an 814 arcmin@xmath2 field .",
    "based on this result , we expect to find in our available 43 arcmin@xmath2 field three candidate ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath3 .",
    "slitmask spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm the identity of the candidate ly@xmath0 emitters and the lbgs .",
    "these observations will provide higher signal to noise and higher spectral resolution to measure the characteristic asymmetric line profile of ly@xmath0 at high redshift .",
    "the larger wavelength coverage will allow the detection of emission lines from the presumed lbgs outside the @xmath14 filter .",
    "time has been allocated to carry out these observations with fors2 .",
