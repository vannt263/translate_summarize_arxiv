    "since the appearance of the pioneering paper of snyder and weinberg@xcite , many articles have been published on the problem of meson fields in the presence of strong electric and gravitational fields . in 1940",
    "schiff , snyder and weinberg@xcite carried out one of the earliest investigations of the solution of the klein - gordon equation with a strong external potential .",
    "they solved the problem of the square well potential and discovered that there is a critical point @xmath0 where the bound antiparticle mode appears to coalesce with the bound particle .",
    "popov@xcite showed that this phenomenon is a particular effect characteristic of short range potentials and , consequently it should not be expected to be observed when one deals with coulomb interactions@xcite the asymptotic limit of the schiff - snyder effect , for infinite walls , has been studied by fulling@xcite . in @xmath1 ,",
    "bawin and lavine@xcite demonstrated that the antiparticle @xmath2-wave bound state arises for some conditions on the potential parameters , showing in this way that , for short range potentials , the presence of the schiff - snyder effect strongly depends on the angular momentum contribution .",
    "the presence of strong fields introduces quantum phenomena , such as supercriticallity and spontaneous pair production , that can not be described using perturbative techniques .",
    "the discussion of overcritical behavior of bosons requires a full understanding of the single particle spectrum , and consequently of the exact solutions to the klein - gordon equation .",
    "overcritical behavior associated with scalar particles in strong short range potentials could be of interest in understanding quantum effects such as superradiance@xcite or particle production in the vicinity of black holes @xcite .",
    "in the present article , we solve the klein - gordon equation for a woods - saxon and cusp potentials .",
    "the interest in computing bound states and spontaneous pair creation processes in such potentials lies in the fact that they possess properties that could permit us to determine how the shape of the potential affects the pair creation mechanism .",
    "we show that the antiparticle bound states arise also for the woods - saxon potential well , which is a smoothed out form of the square well .",
    "we also show that a cusp potential well supports antiparticle bound states .",

    "we derive the equation governing the eigenvalues corresponding to the bound states and compute the bound states . in sec .",
    "4 we compute the bound states of the klein - gordon equation in the presence of an one - dimensional cusp potential well .",
    "we also show the dependence of supercritical states on the strength and shape of the potential . finally , in sec . 5 , we briefly summarize our results .",
    "the klein - gordon equation minimally coupled to a vector potential @xmath3 can be written as    @xmath4    where the metric @xmath5 has signature @xmath6 , and we have set @xmath7 choosing to work with a vector potential of the form ,    @xmath8    eq .",
