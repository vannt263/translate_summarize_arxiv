    "atomic nuclei provide a rich diversity of properties typical for mesoscopic systems .",
    "one of standard features of these systems is the mean field and the associated shell structure .",
    "indeed , the single - particle motion is a cornerstone of nuclear structure @xcite and the stability of nuclei depends on non - uniformities of the single - particle level distribution and presence of magic gaps .",
    "contrary to atomic systems , a strong spin - orbit interaction is a key ingredient to fully explain the observed magic numbers in atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of nuclear structure is the clustering phenomenon which is of particular importance in states close to their cluster decay thresholds @xcite due to generic features of the continuum coupling @xcite . in this context @xmath2-particle , which is strongly bound and @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction is not strong enough to make a bound state , can be considered as an effective building block of the nuclear structure . indeed ,",
    "many features of nuclear masses and excitations in even - even @xmath8 light nuclei can be explained by ( 2n-2p ) quarteting effects @xcite . this molecular viewpoint has been introduced by wheeler , von weizsacker and wefelmeier",
    "@xcite long before the nuclear shell model ( sm ) has been proposed @xcite , and cluster structures have been extensively studied for more than four decades @xcite ( for a selection of recent works , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . recently , theoretical and experimental investigations of clustering phenomena have been extended towards neutron - rich nuclei @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "if an @xmath2-cluster is expressed as the lowest @xmath9 sm configuration , it is a spin - zero system where only the central interactions contributes .",
    "the stability of such a cluster and , hence , its physical significance is closely related to the respective role of different components of the nuclear interaction in building shell structure and nuclear excitations . hence , the cluster - shell competition is a key issue to understand how effective building blocks of nuclear structure arise from complex nuclear forces .",
    "usually , this competition is studied at the level of two - nucleon forces only but it is expected that three - nucleon forces and four - nucleon forces may play some role in this problem as well .",
    "another important issue in this discussion is the role of coupling to the decay channels which would require the open quantum system formulation of the many - body problem , as provided by the continuum shell model ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . these two important issues will not be considered in this paper .",
    "being interested in the shell or cluster nature of a nuclear state the shell and cluster models , and their interrelation can guide us . in general",
    "both of these models provide us with a complete ( or overcomplete ) set of basis states , until we speak about the general shell and cluster models , without severe truncations which are necessarily applied in practical applications ( see e.g. the specific models applied later on in this article ) .",
    "it means that any state can be expanded in both basis .",
    "then there are four different possibilities .",
    "( i ) the expansion in the shell model basis is simple , but in the cluster basis is complicated ; we can call these states as shell - model - like ( sm ) states .",
    "( ii ) the expansion in the cluster model basis is simple , but in the shell basis is complicated ; we can call these states as cluster - model - like ( cm ) states ( sometimes they are called rigid molecule - like cluster states ) .",
    "( iii ) the expansion is simple both in the shell model basis and in the cluster basis ; we can call these states as shell - model - like cluster ( smc ) states .",
    "( iv ) the expansion is complicated both in the shell model basis and in the cluster basis ; these states are not interesting from our present viewpoint .",
    "( for a recent discussion , see ref . @xcite and references cited therein ) . in favorable cases , states ( i)-(iii ) can be characterized by simple symmetries .",
    "for example , sm states in the superconducting limit obey su(2 ) symmetry , rigid molecule - like cluster states can have so(4 ) symmetry , while states with su(3 ) symmetry have good shell and cluster nature at the same time .    in this work",
    ", we aim at obtaining a transparent picture of the cluster - shell competition based on studies of both binding energies and complex spectra .",
    "hence , even though different microscopic studies of the cluster - shell competition are currently possible @xcite , we apply here the gcm @xcite on a simple , flexible basis of antisymmetrized quasi - cluster ( aqc ) states @xcite , where the cluster - shell transition is described by a single parameter .",
    "the aqc parameterization is used here to extract the information about the cluster - shell competition in @xmath0ne and @xmath1 mg in various spatial configurations and for different values of the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "recently , a considerable interest is devoted to studying quantum phases and phase - transitions in algebraic models .",
    "( for a recent review , see @xcite and references cited therein . ) .",
    "the transition from a cluster state to the sm state when changing a control - parameter , seems to be analogous to this problematic .",
    "therefore , we discuss in this paper similarities and differences between the present gcm+aqc approach and the algebraic approach . as a result of this comparison ,",
    "a possible algebraic calculation is outlined for a further study of the cluster - shell competition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formulation of the model and details of the aqc approach are summarized in section ii . in section iii , we present results concerning the cluster - shell competition in @xmath0ne and @xmath1 mg . in particular , we exhibit the evolution of wave functions for different low spin states of @xmath0ne with the strength of the spin - orbit coupling by plotting the squared overlap between the variational gcm wave function and the aqc basis states .",
    "possible connections to a group theoretical understanding of the cluster - shell transition is discussed in section iv .",
    "finally , the main conclusions of this work are given in section v.",
    "in this section , we introduce the gcm+aqc approach and the many - body hamiltonian used in the cluster - shell transition studies of this work . let us begin by presenting the basic idea of the aqc wave function and its relation to other parameterized cluster - like wave functions .      in conventional @xmath2-cluster models ,",
    "the single particle wave function is described as a gaussian packet @xcite : @xmath10 \\chi_i ~ \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 represent the spin - isospin part of the @xmath12-th single particle , and @xmath13 is a real parameter representing the center of a gaussian for @xmath14-th @xmath2-cluster . to assure that the spurious center - of - mass kinetic energy is exactly removed",
    ", the parameter @xmath15 is the same for _ all _ nucleons . in this brink - bloch wave function @xcite ,",
    "four nucleons ( spin - up proton / neutron , spin - down proton / neutron ) share the common @xmath13 value .",
    "hence , the spin - orbit interaction vanishes for brink - bloch @xmath2-clusters . in general , even if there are valence nucleons around clusters , the spin - orbit interaction vanishes for a single slater determinant wave function because the time - odd components in the spatial part of such a wave function are missing @xcite .",
    "hence , the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction for valence nucleons around @xmath2-cluster(s ) can be taken into account only by performing the angular momentum projection and/or by superposing the slater determinants with complex coefficients .",
    "however , for @xmath16-nuclei , the spin - orbit interaction does not act even after these treatments , since all clusters have spin zero .      in amd @xcite and fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd )",
    "@xcite approaches , both deriving from the time - dependent cluster ( tdc ) approach @xcite , the gaussian center parameters are allowed to be complex . in this case , the single particle wave functions contain time - odd components , and the spin - orbit interaction acts even at the level of a single slater determinant , i.e. before the angular momentum projection .",
    "the single particle wave function of @xmath12-th nucleon has the following form : @xmath17 \\chi_i ~ \\ , \\label{amd}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a complex parameter @xcite .",

    "since this single particle wave function breaks the time - reversal symmetry , it allows to describe the boost of nuclei .",
    "thus , this variational ansatz ( [ amd ] ) for the wave function can be applied not only in static , nuclear structure calculations but also in dynamical nuclear reaction calculations @xcite . in the latter case , equations of motion for the time - evolution of parameters @xmath21 @xcite are derived from the variational principle associated with the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the aqc approach @xcite allows for a convenient transformation of the sm wave function in @xmath22 coupling scheme into the @xmath2-cluster wave function .",
    "hence , this approach is particularly well suited for studies of the cluster - shell competition and a description of the mixed phase in terms of quasi - clusters , i.e. the sm - like cluster states .",
    "let us suppose that the nucleus consists of few @xmath2-clusters and one quasi - cluster . in general , one can also consider valence nucleons but to keep the discussion of the cluster - shell competition as transparent as possible , we shall restrict ourselves to systems consisting of @xmath2-clusters and quasi - cluster(s ) .",

    "a reasonable approach would consist of two steps .",
    "the first one is the algebraic cluster model calculation , and the second step is the shell - model calculation .",
    "the two parts have a matching point : the @xmath174 dynamical symmetry is present in both models @xcite .",
    "the basic features of the algebraic studies can be summarized as follows .",
    "a group - theoretical model is considered with a well - defined model space . on the other hand the interactions ( but only the interactions )",
    "are varied .",
    "they have limiting cases , called dynamical symmetries .",
    "when a dynamical symmetry holds , the eigenvalue - problem has an analytical solution , due to the fact that the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the invariant operators of a chain of nested subgroups .",
    "in such a case the eigenstates of the hamiltonian have a complete set of good quantum numbers .",
    "the general hamiltonian , however , which has contributions from interactions with different dynamical symmetries , has to be diagonalized numerically .",
    "the relative weight of the dynamically symmetric limits serves as a control parameter , and it defines the phase - diagram of the system . when there are more than two dynamical symmetries , more than one control parameters appear .    in the limit of large particle number phase - transitions",
    "are seen in the sense that the derivative of the energy - minimum , as a function of the control - parameter , is discontinuous .",
    "the order of the derivative , showing the discontinuity , gives the order of the phase - transition .",
    "thus , in this framework the phase - transition is investigated quantitatively , like in the thermodynamics .",
    "a phase is defined as a region of the phase diagram between the endpoint of the dynamical symmetry and the transition point .",
    "it is also conjectured @xcite that such a quantum phase is characterized by a quasi - dynamical symmetry .",
    "therefore , although the real dynamical symmetry is valid only at a single point of the phase - diagram , the more general quasi - dynamical symmetry may survive , and in several cases does survive @xcite , in the whole phase . if this conjecture really turns out to be true , then the situation is similar to landau s theory : different phases are determined by different ( quasi - dynamical ) symmetries , and phase transitions correspond to a change of the symmetry .    in the case of the finite particle number",
    "the discontinuities are smoothed out , as the consequence of the finite size effect , but still remarkable changes can be detected in the behavior of the corresponding functions .    in this paper",
    "we have investigated the cluster - shell competition by enlarging the cluster - model - space with some shell - model basis states . the shell - model description , in general ,",
    "is based on a horizontal truncation of the model space ( e.g. to a single major shell ) , while the cluster model makes a vertical truncation ( e.g. a few nucleons with specific symmetry in many major shells ) . therefore , a model space containing both subspaces , and being a space for an irreducible representation of a dynamical algebra can be prohibitively large .",
    "thus , the formulation of the cluster - shell competition in terms of the group theoretical framework seems to be feasible in a two - step procedure .",
    "the first step is the cluster study based on an algebraic model , the second one is the shell - model calculation .",
    "the reason why they can be combined to a coherent investigation is that they have a matching point : both of them have a limit of the @xmath174 dynamical symmetry @xcite .",
    "we begin with the algebraic cluster model . in case of a binary cluster - configuration of closed - shell clusters , e.g. @xmath84o+@xmath175he , we practically need to describe only the relative motion .",
    "algebraically it can be done by applying the vibron model of @xmath176 structure @xcite , which have ( @xmath177 ) @xmath178 and and ( @xmath179 ) @xmath180 bosons , as building blocks .",
    "the pauli - principle can be taken into account by a basis - truncation in the simple case of closed - shell clusters @xcite , and with this constraint the vibron model can really give a reasonable approach to the @xmath2-cluster bands of @xmath0ne @xcite .",
    "the @xmath176 algebra of the relative motion can be considered as the dynamical algebra of the truncated harmonic oscillator problem for a finite spectrum ( as the compact form of the noncompact @xmath181 dynamical algebra of the oscillator problem without truncation ) .",
    "it is worth stressing here that this simplified algebraic structure is valid only from the viewpoint of the physical operators when no coupling to the internal cluster degrees of freedom is considered . from the viewpoint of the model space ,",
    "on the other hand , the internal degrees of freedom have to be taken into account , otherwise the pauli - principle could not be appreciated @xcite .",
    "the internal cluster structure is usually described in terms of the elliott - model of @xmath182 group structure , where @xmath183 refers to the spin - isospin degrees of freedom and @xmath184 stands for the space - part of the internal cluster wave function .",
    "the cluster model with the @xmath176 algebraic structure has two dynamical symmetries : @xmath174 , and @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , the phase - space is one - dimensional , having these limits as ending points .",
    "the @xmath174 limit corresponds to a soft vibrator in the language of the collective model , or to a shell - model - like clusterization from the microscopic viewpoint .",
    "the @xmath185 represents the rigid rotor limit , i.e a rigid molecule - like configuration , which extends to very many major shells @xcite . a recent schematic calculation @xcite showed that at a certain value of the control parameter",
    "a phase - transition takes place , and the quasidynamical @xmath174 symmetry characterizes the whole phase from the limit of the real dynamical symmetry up to very close to the point of transition .    when the coupling between the relative motion and internal cluster degrees of freedom is taken into account @xcite , then there is a third dynamical symmetry of the cluster model , denoted by @xmath186 , which corresponds to the weak - coupling limit .",
    "then the phase diagram is two dimensional , and can be illustrated by a triangle @xcite .",
    "the @xmath174 symmetry is known to be very important in the shell model since the pioneering work of elliott @xcite .",
    "a specific @xmath174 symmetry defines a ( collective ) rotational band in terms of the basis of the spherical shell model .",
    "( in the shell - model context the symmetry is usually called @xmath187 , and not @xmath174 .",
    "the two groups are uniquely related to each other , once the total number of particles ( oscillator quanta ) is given , this being the only extra generator of @xmath174 in comparison with @xmath187 . in the shell model calculations usually only a single major shell is incorporated , therefore , this number does not play any role , and it is not needed . in the cluster model , however , several major shells are included , thus it is more practical to use @xmath174 , which defines @xmath187 , too . )    the problem of a shell - model - like phase - transition has been studied in @xcite .",
    "this is also a schematic calculation , in which a finite fermion system was considered , with a hamiltonian having two dynamical symmetries : the @xmath187 one of the elliott model , and the @xmath188 dynamical symmetry , which diagonalizes the pairing interaction of the superconductivity .",
    "a phase - transition was observed at a critical point of the control parameter , and the quasi - dynamical @xmath187 symmetry turned out to be valid between the transition point and the endpoint of the @xmath187 limit .    from the viewpoint of the phase",
    "studies it is remarkable that recently a triangle - like phase diagram has been proposed also for the shell model @xcite , which , in addition to the @xmath187 and @xmath188 symmetries has the independent - particle model as the third corner .",
    "as the realistic calculations are concerned , the method of the works @xcite are especially remarkable from our viewpoint . there",
    "the @xmath0ne was described within a shell - model , by considering 4 nucleons in the full sd shell , and applying @xmath189(3 ) basis .",
    "the hamiltonian includes spin - orbit , quadrupole - quadrupole and pairing terms as well .",
    "the @xmath174 limit of the two ( cluster and shell ) models coincide with each other , as mentioned before , and will be discussed more in detail later on . the difference in the physical content , as indicated here ( vibrational limit in the cluster model and rotational limit in the shell model ) seems to be a contradiction , but in fact it is not .",
    "in the shell model the @xmath174 dynamical symmetry determines a rotational band from the basis states of a single major shell . on the other hand the vibrational limit of the cluster model is related to major shell excitations .",
    "if the algebraic ( @xmath174 ) shell model is extended by the inclusion of major shell excitations , then it has an algebraic structure of @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "in the limit of the large particle number , however , it simplifies to a @xmath191(3 ) boson model @xcite , ( or contracted symplectic model @xcite , ) which contains both the hydrodynamic model ( major shell excitations corresponding to giant resonances ) , and the elliott @xmath189(3 ) model .",
    "similarly , the @xmath191(3 ) dynamical symmetry of the cluster model incorporates the major shell excitations as well as the @xmath189(3 ) structure within the major shells @xcite .",
    "( in the language of the liquid drop collective model , elliott s @xmath187 corresponds to the vorticity of the liquid : the ( 0,0 ) @xmath187-scalar represents the irrotational flow , while non-@xmath187-scalar corresponds to non - zero vorticity . )    in this article we have introduced aqc model to describe the cluster - shell competition , where @xmath28 and @xmath79 are two parameters to characterize the state .",
    "we can map the values of @xmath28 and @xmath79 on the diagram in fig .",

    ", aqc model can be interpreted in terms of the group theory by introducing a diagram in fig . 10 .",

    "the first one is an extension of the work of ref .",

    "this could determine quantitatively , where the real nucleus sits on the phase diagram of the cluster model .",

    "the second part of the calculation should be a shell - model study , similar in spirit to those of @xcite .",
    "we discuss here the necessary scenario from the angle of the work @xcite .",
    "i ) include not only the ground - band , but also the negative parity band , and ii ) investigate the behavior of the system under the influence of the systematic change of the strength of the spin - orbit and/or pairing interactions .",
    "iii ) when doing so the survival of the quasidynamical @xmath187 could be determined from the analysis of the wave function .",
    "the control parameter is the relative weight of the @xmath174 symmetry - breaking interaction in both cases . on the cluster side it is the dipole interaction ( compared to the @xmath174-symmetric quadrupole one ) , while on the shell - model side it can be spin - orbit and pairing forces .",
    "the quasi - dynamical @xmath174 symmetry defines a phase on both sides of real @xmath174 dynamical symmetry ( being the matching point of the two phase - diagram ) .",
    "this kind of investigation could answer a question , like : where the system is located on the phase diagram of the cluster model and that of the shell - model .",
    "furthermore , one could figure out if phase - transition(s ) take(s ) place , and if so , what kind of transitions .",
    "recently , a microscopic calculation of the cluster - shell competition became possible , and in this work we introduced the gcm+aqc formalism to describe this competition in a simple way .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is a key quantity which drives the transition from cm states to sm states . in our model , this effect is implanted into the trial wave function . by introducing a single parameter @xmath28 , one @xmath2 cluster orbiting around @xmath84o is changed into a  quasi cluster \" , where the motion of four nucleons depends on the spin direction of each nucleon .",
    "the energy levels of @xmath0ne calculated in the gcm on a collective basis of the aqc states for different strengths of the spin - orbit interaction : @xmath68 mev , were compared with the experimental data .",
    "the experimental level spacing of @xmath135 shows a clear deviation from the @xmath128 rule , and the spin - orbit interaction is needed to explain this deviation .",
    "although a reasonable description of the scattering phase shift in @xmath137he+@xmath132 reaction is possible for @xmath62 mev , this value should be reduced for @xmath0ne .",
    "judging from the level spacing between the ground state @xmath125 and the @xmath133 excited state , the optimal value of the spin - orbit coupling strength is @xmath134 mev .",
    "thus , the spin - orbit strength is overestimated if the scattering phase shift in @xmath137he+@xmath132 is fitted without introducing the tensor interaction explicitly .",
    "both the experimental results and the gcm+aqc calculation show that the @xmath133 state in @xmath0ne deviates strongly from the rotational sequence .",
    "our studies demonstrate that the deviation increases with increasing the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .    for @xmath130 mev , the energy of a @xmath125 state as a function of @xmath28 exhibits a minimum at @xmath40 .",
    "with an increasing value of @xmath113 , the minimum is shifted towards a finite value of @xmath28 and the kinetic energy of nucleons in the @xmath2 quasi cluster increases as well . for @xmath134 mev ,",
    "the energy minimum is found at @xmath143 0.2 .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath28 value increases with increasing the angular momentum .",
    "the curves of energy as a function of @xmath28 show that an optimal value of @xmath79 ( a distance between @xmath84o and an @xmath2 quasi cluster ) is around 3 fm for @xmath126 .",
    "with increasing angular momentum , the optimal value of @xmath79 decreases ( @xmath79 = 2 fm for @xmath133 ) .      concerning the three different kinds of states from the viewpoint of their shell or cluster nature : the sm states , the cm states and the smc states , the following correspondence can be made in the language of the aqc formalism .",
    "the sm state ( type ( i ) ) corresponds to a situation of small @xmath79 and large @xmath28 , while a rigid molecule - like cm state ( type ( ii ) ) corresponds to large @xmath79 and small @xmath28 .",
    "the smc state ( type ( iii ) ) involves small @xmath79 and small @xmath28 values .",
    "usually , @xmath79 is finite due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "it follows from the present gcm+aqc study that even parity states of @xmath0ne and @xmath1 mg are of the type ( iii ) .",
    "we have also discussed how a similar study could be formulated in terms of algebraic models .",
    "a possible approach would consist of two steps .",
    "the first one is the description of experimental data in terms of the algebraic cluster model , and the second step is the shell - model calculation .",
    "the reason why they can be combined is that they have a matching point , the limit of the @xmath174 dynamical symmetry @xcite , which is the intersection of two phase - diagrams .",
    "the control parameter would be the relative weight of the @xmath174 symmetry - breaking interactions . via this route",
    ", one might hope to understand whether the phase - transition possibly takes place between the cluster- and shell - configurations and what could be the nature of this transitions .",
    "the @xmath174 symmetry is a common intersection of the cluster and shell models .",
    "cm and sm states can be characterized using the two triangles ( see fig .",
    "10 ) which merge in the @xmath174 limit . in this paper",
    ", we have studied the cluster - shell competition using the gcm+aqc microscopic framework . in this framework , @xmath28 and @xmath79 are parameters of a collective aqc basis , which give an insight into the nature of many - body states .",
    "these parameters can be associated with features shown on this diagram .",
    "the @xmath174 limit is characterized by small @xmath79 and small @xmath28 values , thus the wave function has the nature of both cluster and shell models .",
    "increasing @xmath28 changes @xmath2 cluster(s ) into @xmath22-coupling wave function , which corresponds to the shift from @xmath174 to the @xmath188 limit on the shell model side . finally , increasing @xmath79 corresponds to the change from @xmath174 to the @xmath185 limit ( the rigid rotor state ) on the cluster model side . in this way",
    ", the microscopic results of the gcm+aqc model can be interpreted in intuitive language of the group theory .",
