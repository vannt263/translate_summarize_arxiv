    "this article is devoted to the study of the existence and stability of vortex solutions of the ginzburg - landau equations in finite two - dimensional domains with boundaries . for the case of the infinite plane",
    ", a large amount of work has been devoted to such questions , motivated by the ubiquitous character of the ginzburg - landau equations either in the study of superconductors or for the abelian higgs model .",
    "it is known @xcite that for the infinite system the ginzburg - landau energy functional has a lower bound which is saturated for a special choice of the parameters ( which corresponds to the limiting case between type i and type ii superconductors ) .",
    "the minimizing equations at this special point , also called the dual point , are first order differential equations and they admit solutions with vortices .",
    "these different vortex solutions are classified by an integer of topological origin , namely the winding number of the order parameter which , roughly speaking , counts the number of vortices .",
    "although the ginzburg - landau equations in finite domains have been investigated @xcite , there is no generalization so far of the results concerning the dual point for finite two - dimensional domains ( that we shall also call hereafter ` billiards ' ) . in this paper",
    ", we study such a generalization ; besides a theoretical interest , our motivation has been triggered by a set of new experimental results obtained on small aluminium disks @xcite in a mesoscopic regime where the radius @xmath0 is comparable with both the coherence length @xmath1 and the london penetration length @xmath2 there , the magnetization , as a function of the applied magnetic field , presents a series of jumps with an overall shape reminiscent of type - ii superconductors .",
    "such a behaviour is very different from that of macroscopic systems : in the large , aluminium is a genuine type - i superconductor .",
    "these experiments were first analyzed in the framework of the linearized ginzburg - landau equations @xcite .",
    "although this approach explains some of the observed features , it fails to provide a satisfactory quantitative agreement , and can not account for the large spatial variations of the magnetic field inside the sample ( e.g. vortices ) .",
    "numerical solutions @xcite of the ginzburg - landau equations give a much better description of this phenomenon , and emphasize the importance of the nonlinear term .",
    "however , in this context , no analytical results are available for the full ginzburg - landau equations . using our results on the dual point , we shall derive an analytical expression for the free energy and for the magnetization of a mesoscopic superconductor as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the section 2",
    ", we shall describe the main features and the known results about the dual point and the lower energy bound for an infinite system .",
    "then , in section 3 , we shall study the case of a finite domain and derive an expression of the free energy which , in addition to the previous lower bound , includes a contribution of the boundary .",
    "section 4 contains a geometrical interpretation of these results . in section 5",
    ", our results are applied to analyze experimental data on small superconducting disks . in the conclusion ,",
    "we propose some extensions of our work and a scenario for the nucleation of vortices at the boundary .",
    "from now on , we study a superconducting billiard within the framework of the ginzburg - landau equations ( this assumes that both the order parameter and the vector potential have a slow spatial variation ) .",
    "the expression of the ginzburg - landau energy density @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the complex - valued order parameter , @xmath6 is the magnetic field and the @xmath7 s are real parameters .",
    "the coherence length and the london penetration length are related to these parameters as follows @xcite : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , so that we obtain for the dimensionless free energy @xmath10 @xmath11 , @xmath6 in units of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the quantum of flux .",
    "the lengths are measured in units of @xmath14 ( the numerical factor @xmath15 is for further convenience ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath16 is the only free parameter in ( 2 ) and it determines , in the limit of an infinite system , whether the sample is a type - i or type - ii superconductor @xcite .",
    "the integral is over the two - dimensional domain @xmath17 of the superconducting sample .",
    "the ginzburg - landau equations for the order parameter @xmath18 and for the magnetic field @xmath19 are obtained from a variation of @xmath10 : @xmath20 where the current density @xmath21 is given by @xmath22    the ginzburg - landau equations are nonlinear second order differential equations and their solutions are not known except for some particular cases . however , for the special value @xmath23 , the equations for @xmath18 and @xmath24 can be reduced to first order differential equations .",
    "this special point was first used by sarma @xcite in his discussion of type - i vs type - ii superconductors and then identified by bogomolnyi @xcite in the more general context of stability and integrability of classical solutions of some quantum field theories .",
    "we now review some of these properties of the ginzburg - landau free energy at the dual point .",
    "we shall use the following identity true for two dimensional systems @xmath25 where @xmath21 is the current density and the operator @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 . at the dual point , @xmath28 the expression ( 2 ) for @xmath10 can be rewritten using the identity ( [ ident ] ) as follows @xmath29 where the last integral over the boundary @xmath30 of the system results from stokes theorem .    for an infinite system",
    "we impose , as in @xcite , that the system is superconducting at large distance , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 at infinity .",
    "the boundary term in ( [ identitebog ] ) then becomes @xmath33 this last integral is known as the london fluxoid .",
    "it is quantized and using ( [ currentdens ] ) one shows that it is equal to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the phase of the order parameter .",
    "the integer @xmath36 is the winding number of the order parameter @xmath18 and as such is a topological characteristic of the system .",
    "the extremal values of @xmath37 , namely @xmath38 , are obtained when the bulk integral in ( [ identitebog ] ) vanishes identically , i.e. when the two bogomolnyi @xcite equations are satisfied : @xmath39 these two equations can be decoupled and one obtains that @xmath40 is a solution of the second order nonlinear equation @xmath41 this equation is related to the liouville equation .",
    "the set of equations ( [ equabogo],[liouville ] ) has been obtained without any assumption on the nature of the magnetic field and appears in various other situations , e.g. higgs @xcite , yang - mills @xcite and chern - simons @xcite field theories .",
    "it was proven that these equations admit families of vortex solutions @xcite . for infinite systems",
    ", it can be shown that each vortex carries one flux quantum and that the winding number @xmath36 is equal to the number of vortices in the system .",
    "however , for an infinite system there is no mechanism to select the value of @xmath36 , which only plays the role of a classifying parameter .",
    "it will be precisely the role of the boundary of a finite system to introduce such a selection mechanism and to determine @xmath36 , according to the applied magnetic field .",
    "from now on , we shall study finite size systems in an external magnetic field .",
    "the question then arises to know if such systems can sustain stable vortex solutions and how they behave as a function of the applied field . a simplified version , without applied magnetic field ,",
    "was extensively studied by bethuel et al .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "the mechanism for vortex creation is based on dirichlet boundary conditions of the type @xmath42 on @xmath43 and where @xmath44 is a complex function of degree @xmath36 . in the london limit , namely @xmath45 ,",
    "@xmath40 is 1 almost everywhere but , because of the degree @xmath36 imposed on the boundary , @xmath18 must vanish @xmath36 times in the bulk therefore leading to vortices .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations of the ginzburg - landau equations for a long and thin parallepiped in a uniform magnetic field @xcite show the existence of stationary vortex solutions whose number depends on the applied magnetic field .",
    "these simulations then indicate that the physical picture derived for @xmath46 remains valid for quite a large range of values of @xmath47 , and that the corresponding change of free energy is small ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , for finite systems their size @xmath0 becomes relevant as a new length scale so that @xmath47 is no more the only dimensionless parameter , and its value does not alone control the physics at the mesoscopic scale as it does for infinite systems .",
    "we shall study the case @xmath46 , i.e. the dual point , and extend the previous approach to a system with finite size where boundary effects are important .    in a finite system , there are in general non - zero edge currents and the order parameter is not equal to 1 on the boundary .",
    "hence , the identification of the boundary integral in ( [ identitebog ] ) with the fluxoid ( [ fluxoid ] ) is not possible anymore , and the free energy can not be minimized just by imposing bogomolnyi equations ( [ equabogo ] ) . however , the currents on the boundary of the system screen the external magnetic field and therefore produce a magnetic moment ( a circulation ) opposite to the direction of the field , whereas vortices in the bulk of the system produce a magnetic moment along the direction of the applied field . hence currents in the bulk circulate in a direction opposite to those at the boundary .",
    "if one assumes cylindrical symmetry , the current density @xmath48 has only an azimuthal component , with opposite signs in the bulk and on the edge of the system ( the radial component of @xmath49 is zero since @xmath49 is divergenceless ) .",
    "thus , there exists a circle @xmath50 on which @xmath48 vanishes @xcite .",
    "this allows us to separate the domain @xmath17 into two concentric subdomains @xmath51 such that the boundary @xmath52 is the curve @xmath50 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "on @xmath52 , the current density @xmath21 is zero , therefore one has @xmath53",
    "thus one deduces as above that bogomolnyi and liouville equations are valid in the finite domain @xmath54 as in the case of the infinite plane .",
    "the existence of vortices in a finite domain such as @xmath54 was checked using a numerical solution @xcite of ( [ liouville ] ) : assuming cylindrical symmetry , one shows that @xmath40 vanishes as a power law at the center of the disk , hence there is a vortex in the center ( more precisely a multi - vortex whose multiplicity is determined by the exponent of the power law ) ; moreover , @xmath40 saturates very rapidly to a constant value close to one for lengths larger than @xmath55 .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached by defining @xmath56 and linearizing ( [ liouville ] ) around @xmath57 .",
    "then , @xmath44 satisfies @xmath58 whose general solution is @xmath59 . from the behaviour of the bessel functions",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 , one obtains that for small @xmath62 , @xmath40 vanishes as a power law and saturates rapidly to a constant of order one in a finite range of @xmath62 s ( in units of @xmath63 ) .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath64 through @xmath54 is calculated , in units of the flux quantum @xmath65 , using the fluxoid and ( [ petitbogo ] ) so that @xmath66 as before @xmath36 is the winding number , i.e. @xmath67 , as well as the number of vortices .",
    "the free energy in @xmath54 is @xmath68    we consider now the contribution of @xmath69 to the free energy .",
    "it is given by ( 2 ) and can be rewritten using the phase and the modulus of the order parameter @xmath18 , as @xmath70 we know , from the london equation , that both the magnetic field and the vector potential decrease rapidly ( exponentially ) away from the boundary @xmath71 of the system over a distance of order 1 in units of @xmath72 .",
    "over the same distance , at the dual point , @xmath40 saturates to unity .",
    "one can thus estimate the integral ( [ tran1 ] ) using an elementary version of the saddle - point method .",
    "we assume cylindrical symmetry , and we neglect the term @xmath73 on the boundary because of the covariant neumann boundary conditions at the interface between a superconductor and an insulator @xcite .",
    "we obtain for the free energy the expression @xmath74 where the integral is now over the boundary of the system .",
    "to go further , we need to implement boundary conditions for the magnetic field @xmath75 and the vector potential @xmath76 . the choice @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the external imposed field , corresponds to the geometry of an infinitely long cylinder , where the flux lines are not distorted outside the system .",
    "this boundary condition is not adapted to describe a flat thin disk . a more suitable choice is provided by demanding @xmath79 which means that the total flux through the disk is identical to the flux of the external field , although flux lines are distorted by the superconducting sample .",
    "one can check , using numerical simulations @xcite , that this condition is well satisfied if the disk is thin enough .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath80 implies that the vector potential is identified by continuity to its external applied value @xmath81 which has only the azimuthal component @xmath82 .",
    "it should be noticed that the magnetic field @xmath83 has a non monotonous variation : it is low in the bulk , larger than @xmath78 near the edge of the system , because of the distortion of flux lines , and eventually equal to its applied value far outside the system @xcite .",
    "different choices of boundary conditions will give rise to different limits for a very large system ( i.e. for @xmath84 ) .",
    "the limit of an infinitely long cylinder corresponds to a superconducting bulk sample , whereas the limit of a thin disk , which is the case we consider here , corresponds to a superconducting thin sheet .",
    "the formula ( [ tran2 ] ) for the free energy is similar to the little - parks expression @xcite for a quasi one - dimensional hollow cylinder in a uniform applied magnetic field .",
    "the minimization with respect to @xmath40 gives @xmath85 performing the integral over the boundary of the system , we obtain @xmath86 we have neglected the contribution of the @xmath87 term , which is similar to the first term in the r.h.s . of ( [ free2 ] ) but smaller by a factor of the order @xmath88 .",
    "the integer @xmath36 which appears in ( [ free2 ] ) is the same as in ( [ free1 ] ) , since the order parameter @xmath18 is the same function in both subdomains .",
    "the circulation of its phase @xmath35 ( the winding number ) counts the number of zeroes in the domain @xmath17 , i.e. the number of vortices .",
    "the thermodynamic gibbs potential @xmath89 of the system is obtained from @xmath90 by a legendre transformation so that @xmath91 this relation consists in a set of quartic functions indexed by the integer @xmath36 .",
    "the minimum of the gibbs potential is the envelop curve defined by the equation @xmath92 , i.e. the system chooses its winding number @xmath36 in order to minimize @xmath93 .",
    "this provides a relation between the number @xmath36 of vortices in the system and the applied magnetic field @xmath94 . in the limit of a large enough @xmath95 ,",
    "the quartic term is negligible and the gibbs potential reduces to a set of parabolas ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the winding number @xmath36 is then given by the integer part @xmath96\\ ] ] the magnetization @xmath97 of the system , is given by @xmath98 for @xmath99 smaller that @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 increases linearly with the external flux .",
    "this corresponds to the london regime before the first vortex enters the system .",
    "the field @xmath103 at which the first vortex enters the system corresponds to @xmath104 , i.e. to @xmath105 the subsequent vortices enter one by one for each crossing @xmath106 ; this happens periodically in the applied field , with a period equal to @xmath107 this gives rise to a discontinuity of the magnetization @xmath108    there is a qualitative similarity between the results we derived using the bogomolnyi equations within the domain @xmath54 and those obtained from a linearised version of the ginzburg - landau functional @xcite .",
    "but the two approaches differ in their quantitative predictions due to the importance of the non linear term .",
    "an illustration of this is given in the next section .",
    "in an infinite system , one shows using the boundary conditions @xmath31 and @xmath32 at infinity that equation ( [ fluxoid ] ) implies the quantization of the magnetic flux : @xmath109 if one interprets @xmath6 as a curvature , this relation is analogous to the gauss - bonnet theorem , which states that , for a compact manifold @xmath110 without boundary , the integral of the gaussian curvature @xmath111 over the surface is equal to the euler - poincar characterics @xmath35 of the manifold , which is a topological invariant integer : @xmath112 this result is in fact more than an analogy and at the dual point the ginzburg - landau functional has a useful geometrical interpretation that we shall now highlight @xcite .",
    "the ginzburg - landau functional ( 2 ) for the energy of a superconductor corresponds to a u(1 ) gauge symmetry . for that symmetry",
    ", one can identify an abelian one - form connexion and a two - form curvature @xmath17 respectively given by the vector potential @xmath113 and by the magnetic field @xmath114 .",
    "the complex order parameter @xmath18 is a section of the u(1 ) fiber and the basis manifold is the infinite plane . the above boundary conditions allow to map the plan onto a compact manifold without boundary , namely the sphere .",
    "topological invariants of the problem are obtained from the chern - weil invariant polynomial @xmath115 ( see e.g. @xcite ) for the u(1 ) bundle over a sphere there is only one chern class , @xmath116 .",
    "the integral of that chern class over the basis manifold is a topological invariant integer called a chern number and is precisely given by ( [ chern ] ) .",
    "this chern number plays a role similar to @xmath35 . at the dual point ,",
    "the energy is @xmath117 this fact can be translated in geometrical terms by saying that the extremal free energy is identical to a topological invariant of the problem namely its chern number .    when the basis manifold @xmath110 has a boundary @xmath118 which is not a geodesic , the integral of its curvature is neither an integer nor a topological invariant .",
    "the gauss - bonnet theorem is then generalized by adding a boundary term so that the euler - poincar characteristics @xmath35 is now given by the relation @xmath119 where @xmath111 and @xmath120 are respectively the gaussian curvature of the manifold and the geodesic curvature of the boundary .",
    "a similar result holds for the u(1 ) problem in a bounded domain ( or in an infinite domain with boundary conditions different from those chosen above ) . in that case",
    "the relation equivalent to ( [ gb ] ) is given by the fluxoid relation ( [ fluxoid ] ) : @xmath121 as before , @xmath6 is the curvature of the connexion and the current density @xmath122 plays here the role of a geodesic curvature @xcite .",
    "the expression obtained in ( [ free2 ] ) for the bogomolnyi free energy of a system with a boundary can be rewritten as : @xmath123 the boundary correction is a function @xmath124 of the geodesic curvature .",
    "the results obtained in the preceeding section show that the geodesic curvature is given by @xmath125 for a cylindrically symmetric system and using the appropriate approximations we determined the function @xmath124 as being an even fourth order polynomial in the geodesic curvature .",
    "this geometric interpretation makes us believe that an expression such as ( [ energiegeom ] ) is fairly general .",
    "it could be well suited , as an ansatz , to describe finite systems which are known to have a topological description in the infinite limit ( for instance , a suitable generalisation of ( [ energiegeom ] ) to other symmetry group like su(2 ) could describe some phases of superfluids in a bounded domain ) .",
    "in order to compare our results to the experimental data given in @xcite , we shall consider the limit where the radius @xmath0 is larger than @xmath55 and @xmath1 , ( typically , @xmath126 is considered experimentally @xcite ) .",
    "the thickness of the system is assumed to be small enough so that we can neglect variations of both the magnetic field and the order parameter along the cylinder axis .",
    "we shall prove that within these approximations , the expression ( [ gibbs ] ) captures the main features observed experimentally i.e. the behaviour of the magnetization at low fields ( before the first discontinuity ) , the periodicity and the linear behaviour between the successive jumps and provides a fairly good quantitative agreement .",
    "the magnetization curve in fig.3 ( plotted for the ratio @xmath127 , chosen arbitrarily ) agrees qualitatively with both the numerical and experimental curves of fig.3 in @xcite . besides",
    ", taking the experimental parameters of @xcite , namely @xmath128 and @xmath129 at @xmath130 , we compute from our expressions @xmath131 and @xmath132 these values agree with the results of @xcite to within a few percent .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath133 scales like @xmath134 , whereas @xmath135 scales like @xmath136 in accordance with @xcite .",
    "we calculate the ratio of the magnetization jumps to the maximum value of @xmath110 to be 0.20 as compared to a measured value of 0.22 .",
    "the total number of jumps scales like @xmath137 and the upper critical field is independent of @xmath0 in our theory .",
    "this to agrees fairly well with the experimental data @xcite . we emphasize that this quantitative agreement can not be obtained from the linearized ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "we have investigated the problems of the existence and the stability of vortices in a two - dimensional bounded superconducting system . to that purpose , we have used the ginzburg - landau energy functional at the special dual point characterized by the value @xmath46 which corresponds , for an infinite system , to a superconductor between type i and type ii .",
    "we have shown for that case that it is still possible to obtain vortex solutions at the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "in contrast to the bogomolnyi solution obtained for the infinite plane , where there is no definite value for the number @xmath36 of vortices , there is a selection mechanism for a finite billiard in an external magnetic field that allows to compute the number of vortices as a function of the applied field .",
    "our reasoning is based on the existence of a contour @xmath50 which allows to separate the system in two parts , the bulk containing the vortices and the edge with screening currents .",
    "as such the system might be viewed as a kind of two - dimensional josephson junction or weak superfluid link @xcite .",
    "vortices enter ( or are expelled from ) the superconductor through @xmath50 , if the applied magnetic field is increased ( or decreased ) .",
    "although we considered the special case of the dual point , our analysis provides a satisfactory quantitative description of the behaviour observed experimentally on such small superconducting billiards at least for the regime where the density of vortices is low enough i.e. for small applied magnetic fields . for higher fields , the expression ( [ gibbs ] )",
    "does not describe properly the tail of the magnetization curve where both the periodicity @xmath138 and the amplitude @xmath139 of the jumps decrease and eventually vanish .",
    "in this regime , the vortices interact both between themselves and with the edge currents .",
    "this regime can be studied by a perturbative analysis around the dual point @xcite .",
    "so far , we have studied only equilibrium states . on the basis of numerical simulations of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations",
    "@xcite , we propose a mechanism for vortex nucleation . at each discontinuity of the winding number ,",
    "namely when @xmath140 is a half integer , there is a nodal line , joining the center of the system to its boundary , along which the order parameter @xmath18 vanishes and where its phase is ill defined .",
    "this might be interpreted as an opening of the ring of the screening currents which allows a flux line of the external field to enter the system . in this case",
    ", we expect the contour @xmath50 to coincide with the boundary of the system .",
    "the existence of such a nodal line has been discussed in the context of ginzburg - landau equations and for the related aharonov - bohm problem of a magnetic flux line piercing either the infinite plane @xcite or a finite domain @xcite .    * acknowledgment * it is our pleasure to thank a.ori and t.n.tomaras for useful and enlightening discussions .",
