    "understanding quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is a relevant fact in quantum many body problems @xcite .",
    "qpts usually occur in a system described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath0 , with @xmath1 exactly solvable , @xmath2 an interaction term and @xmath3 the corresponding control interaction - strength parameter .",
    "the qpt occurs when @xmath3 reaches some critical value @xmath4 in which the of the system change drastically .",
    "this is the case of an ensemble of atoms interacting with a single bosonic field mode described by the dicke hamiltonian .",
    "quantum mechanics offers different distributions to characterize phase - space properties @xcite .",
    "one is the wigner function , widely used in quantum optics .",
    "other is the husimi distribution , which is given by the overlap between a minimal uncertainty ( coherent ) state and the wavefunction .",
    "this distribution is sometimes more convenient because , unlike wigner distribution , it is non - negative .",
    "husimi distribution has been found useful for a phase - space visualization of a metal - insulator transition @xcite , to analyze quantum chaos in atomic physics @xcite or to analyze models in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "in addition , we would like to point out that the zeros of the husimi distribution have essential information , in particular , the quantum state can be described by its distribution of zeros @xcite .",
    "they are simply the least probable points in phase space and they have been considered as a quantum indicator of classical and quantum chaos @xcite    the husimi distribution has a great amount of information and it can be useful to consider informational measures as the so - called inverse participation ratio and wehrl entropy @xcite .",
    "recently , an analysis of qpt in the dicke model by means of information measures @xcite has been done in position and momentum spaces , separately .",
    "here we will do an informational description of the dicke model qpt in phase space in terms of the inverse participation ration ( and higher moments ) and the wehrl entropy of the husimi distribution and its marginals .",
    "additionally we will investigate the visualization of dicke model qpt through the zeros of the husimi distribution .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we briefly remind the dicke hamiltonian , introduce coherent states and the husimi distribution of the ground state , define moments , rnnyi - wehrl entropies and marginals of the husimi distribution and present numerical results . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we study a variational approximation to the ground state wave function in terms of symmetry - adapted coherent states and analyze the information measures in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "zeros of the husimi ( ansatz ) distribution are also computed and graphically represented in order to characterize the qpt .",
    "the single - mode dicke model is a well studied object in the field of qpts @xcite . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath5 describing an ensemble of @xmath6 two - level atoms with level - splitting @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 the angular momentum operators for a pseudospin of length @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the bosonic operators of the field with frequency @xmath13 .",
    "it is well known that there is a qpt at the critical value of the coupling parameter @xmath14 from the so - called normal phase ( @xmath15 ) to the superradiant phase ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "let us consider a basis set @xmath17 of the hilbert space , with @xmath18 the number states of the field and @xmath19 the so called dicke states of the atomic sector .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in this basis are : @xmath20 at this point it is important to note that time evolution preserves the parity @xmath21 of a given state @xmath22 .",
    "that is , the parity operator @xmath23 commutes with @xmath24 and both operators can then be jointly diagonalized . in particular",
    ", the ground state must be even ( see later on eq .",
    "( [ sacs ] ) ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) the standard ( canonical or glauber ) and spin-@xmath27 coherent states ( css ) for the photon and the particle sectors , respectively .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that coherent states form an overcomplete set of the corresponding hilbert space and fulfill the closure relations or resolutions of the identity : @xmath28 with @xmath29 the lebesgue measure on @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the probability amplitude of detecting @xmath32 photons and @xmath33 excited atoms in @xmath34 is given by : @xmath35 the ground state vector @xmath36 will be given as an expansion @xmath37 where the coefficients @xmath38 are calculated by numerical diagonalization of with a given cutoff @xmath39 .",
    "the husimi distribution of @xmath36 is then given by @xmath40 and normalized according to : @xmath41 before discussing marginals of the husimi distribution and their properties , let us introduce an important approximation which will simplify things greatly .",
    "we shall make use of the holstein - primakoff representation @xcite of the angular momentum operators @xmath42 in terms of the bosonic operators , @xmath43=1 $ ] , given by : @xmath44 for high values of @xmath27 ( and fixed @xmath45 ) , we can approximate @xmath46 and @xmath47 , so that the atomic sector can be practically described by an harmonic oscillator , just like the field sector . introducing then position and momentum operators for the two bosonic modes as usual : @xmath48 the wave function position representation is formally equivalent to that of a set of two coupled harmonic oscillators and can be written as @xcite : @xmath49 @xmath50 where we have made use of the definition of @xmath51 ( the hermite polynomials of degree @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively ) and we have truncated the hilbert space of the field sector to dimension @xmath39 looking for the numerical solution and convergence of the eigenproblem @xcite .",
    "this is a very convenient representation that has already been used in ref .",
    "analogously in momentum space : @xmath52 @xmath53 moreover , redefining @xmath54 in , it can be seen ( see e.g. @xcite ) that spin-@xmath27 coherent states @xmath55 go over to ordinary coherent states @xmath56 for @xmath57 ( when identifying @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) . thus , we shall assume the approximation : @xmath60 which turns out to be a quite good estimate , even for relatively small values of @xmath27 , for @xmath61 in a neighborhood of the equilibrium value @xmath62 in . with this approximation , the husimi distribution becomes @xmath63 where now @xmath64 with the new normalization @xmath65      important quantities to visualize the qpt in the dicke model across the critical point @xmath4 will be the @xmath66-th moments of the husimi distribution : @xmath67 note that @xmath68 since @xmath69 is normalized . among all moments we shall single - out the so - called `` inverse participation ratio '' @xmath70 which somehow measures the ( de-)localization of @xmath69 across the phase transition .",
    "the definition of the moments @xmath71 is not restricted to integer values of @xmath66 .",
    "once @xmath71 are known for all integer @xmath66 , there is a unique analytic extension to complex ( and therefore real ) @xmath66 , as integers are dense at infinity .",
    "the `` classical '' ( versus quantum von neumann ) rnyi - wehrl entropy is then defined as : @xmath72 which tends to the wehrl entropy @xmath73 when @xmath74 .    in order to differentiate between position and momentum behaviors",
    ", we shall study the marginals of the husimi distribution in each space : @xmath75 so that @xmath76 we shall also be interested in the moments of marginal distributions @xmath77 specially the marginal inverse participation ratios @xmath78 and marginal wehrl entropies @xmath79 in position ( @xmath80 ) and momentum ( @xmath81 ) spaces as a function of the control parameter @xmath3 . in general , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , but these quantities are approximately equal for high @xmath27 except in a close neighborhood of @xmath4 @xcite .    in appendix [ apa ] we provide a connection with other phase - space formulas for marginal distributions in position and momentum coordinates .",
    "this approach has been used in @xcite to visualize the metal - insulator qpt described by the aubry - andr model .",
    "we also make use of this representation to make numerical calculations more maneuverable .",
    "firstly we have calculated the participation ratio @xmath84 and the wherl entropy @xmath85 for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "the computed results are given in fig .",
    "[ parti ] where we present @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 @xmath87 and for @xmath88 ( for which @xmath89 ) .",
    "notice that the inverse partipation ratio ( top pannel ) is around @xmath90 in the normal phase decreasing around the critical point to reach the value @xmath91 in the superradiant phase .",
    "we can see that the change in the participation ratio is suddener as @xmath27 increases .",
    "the wherl entropy ( botton panel ) is approximately @xmath92 in the normal phase and around @xmath93 in the superradiant phase changing suddenly ( suddener as @xmath27 increases ) around the critical point .",
    "now we present analytical expressions for husimi s distribution , its marginals , moments and entropies using trial states expressed in terms of `` parity - symmetry - adapted '' css introduced by castaos et al .",
    "@xcite , which turn out to be an excellent approximation to the exact quantum solution of the ground ( + ) and first excited (  ) states of the dicke model .      using the direct product @xmath34 as a ground - state ansatz",
    ", one can easily compute the mean energy @xmath94 which defines a four - dimensional `` energy surface '' .",
    "minimizing with respect to these four coordinates gives the equilibrium points : @xmath95 note that @xmath96 and @xmath97 are real and non - zero above the critical point @xmath4 ( i.e. , in the superradiant phase ) .",
    "although the direct product @xmath98 gives a good variational approximation to the ground state mean energy in the thermodynamic limit @xmath99 , it does not capture the correct behavior for other ground state properties sensitive to the parity symmetry @xmath100 of the hamiltonian ( [ qpt01 ] ) like , for instance , uncertainty and entropy measures .",
    "this is why parity - symmetry adapted coherent states are introduced .",
    "indeed , a far better variational description of the ground ( resp .",
    "first - excited ) state is given in terms of the even-(resp .",
