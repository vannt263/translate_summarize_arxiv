    "as shown in uv - vis measures , temporal evolution presents an increase depending on the reduction time .",
    "this increase in intensity of absorption bands is given by the rise in the amount of gold nanoparticles deposited on natural rubber surface , that could generate nanoparticle aggregates mainly observed after the reduction time of 30 minutes @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , it is necessary to remark that electron microscopy only evaluates nanoparticles in the surface of natural rubber membranes , whereas uv - vis spectroscopy evaluates all deposited nanoparticles between the optical analysis path , since it was previously demonstrated that particles could be incorporated within 3 micrometers in the volume of natural rubber membranes @xcite .    according to nanoparticle evaluation through mlsos ( figure [ figqtty ] ) ,    * : concentration oscillates along reduction time .",
    "this scenario occurs due to the amount of blurred points in photomicrographs corresponding to this magnification ( namely 6 , 60 and 120 minutes ) ; this fact can also be attributed to the small amount of nanoparticles contained in the photomicrograph for the reduction time of 9 minutes .",
    "the higher concentration of nanoparticles in 15 minutes is attributed to the evaluation of an area with nanoparticles accumulated on the surface , for better comprehension of size and shape of formed nanoparticles . however , in 30 and 120 minutes it is possible to observe the increase of gold nanoparticles incorporated in the surface of natural rubber , equally presented by uv - vis spectroscopy results . * : concentration increases logarithmically , tending to stability .",

    "<S> this study consolidates multi - level starlet segmentation ( mlss ) and multi - level starlet optimal segmentation ( mlsos ) , techniques for photomicrograph segmentation that use starlet wavelet detail levels to separate areas of interest in an input image . </S>",
    "<S> several segmentation levels can be obtained using multi - level starlet segmentation ; after that , matthews correlation coefficient ( mcc ) is used to choose an optimal segmentation level , giving rise to multi - level starlet optimal segmentation . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> mlsos is employed to estimate the concentration of gold nanoparticles with diameter around @xmath0 , reducted on natural rubber membranes . </S>",
    "<S> these samples were used on the construction of sers / serrs substrates and in the study of natural rubber membranes with incorporated gold nanoparticles influence on _ leishmania braziliensis _ physiology . </S>",
    "<S> precision , recall and accuracy are used to evaluate the segmentation performance , and mlsos presents accuracy greater than 88% for this application .    * </S>",
