    ", we consider another two sets of inputs with @xmath48 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in table iv and v. fig .",
    "4 and 5 illustrate the evolution of @xmath4 in these three special cases : a ) @xmath51 ( table iii ) , b ) @xmath48 ( table iv ) and c ) @xmath87 ( table v ) for dirac and majorana neutrinos respectively . note that the input values of @xmath4 and @xmath45 at @xmath17 in table iv have the same absolute values but opposite signs as that in table iii . if neutrinos are dirac particles , the rge running behaviours of @xmath4 and @xmath45 in these two cases are entirely opposite .",
    "we can find that at @xmath200 gev , @xmath4 and @xmath45 in table iii and iv still have the same absolute values but opposite signs . for dirac neutrinos",
    ", @xmath212 is always decreasing and approaching zero in the mssm when running from @xmath17 to @xmath119 .",
    "it means that when evolving from @xmath17 to @xmath119 , positive @xmath4 decreases while negative @xmath4 increases on the contrary , but the signs of @xmath4 are not changed . however , if neutrinos are majorana particles , the running behaviours of the dirac - type cp - violating parameters @xmath4 and @xmath45 strongly depend on the majorana - type cp - violating parameters @xmath92 .",
    "a point need to be pointed out is that the running behaviours of @xmath4 in a ) , b ) and c ) three cases are somehow similar as shown in fig .",
    "5 . this is because of these three sets of inputs correspond to the same values of the majorana angles @xmath213 and @xmath214 in the standard parametrization . by choosing a different set of inputs of @xmath92 , we are able to make a very different evolution of @xmath4 for the same set of @xmath45 .",
    "a more special case is that @xmath87 but the majorana cp violation is nonzero as shown in table v. if @xmath87 is input at @xmath17 , @xmath4 will keep vanishing in case of dirac neutrinos .",
    "but for majorana neutrinos , @xmath4 can evolve to a nonzero value at @xmath119 , which indicates that the uts expand from a line and the dirac - type cp violation is radiatively generated from the majorana - type cp violations .",
    "as we have declaimed in the beginning section , both the dirac - type and the majorana - type cp violation can be illustrated by the six uts .",
    "therefore , the rge running of the dirac angle matrix @xmath1 and the majorana angle matrix @xmath2 also correspond to the evolutions and the rotations of the uts in the complex plane .",
    "we choose two examples in the mssm with @xmath210 where the majorana neutrino masses are nearly degenerate and show in fig .",
    "6 ( @xmath203 ) and 7 ( @xmath204 ) how the six uts evolve from @xmath17 to @xmath119 , where triangles with thicker sides are at higher energy scale .",
    "the common area of the six uts equals to @xmath215 .",
    "since the orientations of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 have no physical meaning , we simply choose one side of each triangle ( @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 ) to lie on the x - axial and point to the origin .",
    "in this way , the triangle lie above the x - axial is clockwise and corresponds to a positive @xmath4 and the triangle lie below x - axial is anti - clockwise corresponds to a negative @xmath4 on the contrary .",
    "then we can clearly see from fig .",
    "6 , when evolve from @xmath17 to the high energy scale @xmath119 , the jarlskog @xmath4 changed its sign as illustrated in table iii .",
    "in summary , we introduced the concepts of the dirac angle matrix @xmath1 and the majorana angle matrix @xmath2 for dirac and majorana neutrinos respectively and show that the angle matrix carries equivalent information to the complex mixing matrix itself , but with the added advantage of being basis and phase convention independent . our prescription works for any number of fermion generation .",
    "we further calculated the one - loop rges of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and some other rephasing invariant parameters .",
    "numerical analyses are carried out for illustration .",
    "we find that apparently different from the case of dirac neutrinos , for majorana neutrinos the rg - evolutions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 strongly depend on the majorana - type cp - violating parameters and are quite sensitive to the sign of @xmath5",
    ". they may receive significant radiative corrections in the mssm with large @xmath6 if three neutrino masses are nearly degenerate .",
    "of course , the numerical examples presented in this work are mainly for the purpose of illustration .",
    "the point is that the nature and the mass spectrum of neutrinos determine the rge running behaviours of those rephasing invariant parameters which may be crucial for building a realistic neutrino model .",
    "our analysis complement those previous studies of radiative corrections to the physical parameters of dirac and majorana neutrinos and are helpful for building a realistic neutrino mass model at a high energy scale .",
