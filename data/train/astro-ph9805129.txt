    "nearby compact groups may provide one of the best laboratories for studying the effects of on - going collisions on the structure and dynamics of galaxies .",
    "one of the most dense compact groups known is hgc 16 ( h16 ) , or arp 318 , originally catalogued by @xcite as an association of four late - type galaxies at v @xmath5 4000 @xmath8 with a small velocity dispersion of 123 @xmath8 and a median galaxy - galaxy projected separation of 44 h@xmath6 kpc ( @xcite , @xmath9 is the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath10/100 km sec@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) .",
    "@xcite found three other bright galaxies near the group , in the same redshift range , within a median radius of 0.197 h@xmath6 mpc .",
    "all seven galaxies were found to have nuclear emission lines , making h16 the highest concentration of starburst and active nuclei galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "rosat observations of the group ( @xcite ) revealed an intragroup medium with a total extent of @xmath5 400 h@xmath6 kpc , a temperature of 0.3 kev and density of n@xmath11 = 2.05 @xmath12 10@xmath13 cm@xmath6 .",
    "such density and temperature are typical of compact groups of galaxies , which were shown to fit well on the extension of the correlations between the x - ray luminosity and both the gas temperature and velocity dispersion of clusters of galaxies ( although with a steeper slope than for clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of diffuse x - ray emission around h16 is a strong evidence that this is a genuine group .",
    "compact groups that are true high - density systems , as h16 seems to be , provide excellent environments in which to study the properties of merger galaxies .",
    "such a study for a compact group galaxy is important not only to investigate the process of galaxy formation through mergers but it may also provide important information on the dynamical evolutionary stage of the compact group .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the dynamical state of the hickson compact group 16 through the study of the detailed 2-d kinematics of four of its member galaxies : h16a ( ngc 835 , mrk 1022 ) , h16b ( ngc 833 ) , h16c ( ngc 838 , mrk 1021 ) and h16d ( ngc 839 ) .",
    "the four galaxies are optically luminous systems , with m@xmath15 ranging from 20.3 @xmath16 5 log @xmath9 to 19.5 @xmath16 5 log @xmath9 .",
    "h16a , c and d are strong radio and infrared sources ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite report on co observations for three of the four galaxies and calculate large masses of molecular gas .",
    "analysis of their central spectra shows that h16a and d are liners , h16b is a seyfert galaxy and h16c has a starburst nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "rubin , hunter & ford ( 1991 , rhf91 ) obtained rotation curves ( rcs ) for the four galaxies and found they have `` abnormal '' shapes , a common feature among strongly interacting and merging galaxies .",
    "h@xmath4 emission - line observations of h16 a , b , c , d obtained with a scanning fabry - perot are used here to derive the spatial distribution and kinematics of their warm gas content .",
    "the warm gas is a good tracer of the total gas mass ( that is gas in all phases ) in a galaxy ( @xcite ) and it should also be a good tracer of the potential of the galaxy .",
    "the details of the kinematics of the emission - line velocity field can be used as diagnostics of the gaseous merger dynamical state .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows : section 2 gives details of the observations and data reduction . in section 3 , we present the results for the photometry , the internal kinematics and the various mass determinations of the galaxies .",
    "section 4 contains the discussion and our conclusions .",
    "images of h16a , b , c , d , in r and i were available for this study .",
    "the ccd r - band images were taken as part of a large study of the systematic properties of galaxies in compact groups .",
    "details of these data are described in @xcite .",
    "the images have kindly been made available by p. hickson . the i - band image was a 600s  frame ( 15 on a side , 0.44 arcsec pixels ) taken with the 1.5 m telescope at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory in october 1997 .",
    "the mean seeing values for the r and i images were 15 and 12 respectively .",
    "luminosity , ellipticity and position angle ( pa ) profiles were determined for h16b , c and d , using the isophote package in stsdas ( @xcite ) .",
    "h16a is not well described by concentric elliptical isophotes and therefore no fit of this galaxy was attempted .",
    "observations were carried out with the fabry - perot instrument cigale mounted on the eso 3.6 m telescope in august 1995 .",
    "cigale is composed of a focal reducer ( bringing the original f/8 focal ratio of the cassegrain focus to f/2 ) , a scanning fabry - perot , a narrow band interference filter and an image photon counting system detector ( ipcs ) .",
    "the ipcs , with a time sampling of 1/50 s and zero readout noise makes it possible to scan the interferometer rapidly ( typically 5 s per channel ) avoiding sky transparency , airmass and seeing variation problems during the exposures .",
    "table 1 contains the journal of the observations .",
    "the exposure times were two hours for each of two pointings , one on h16ab and one on h16cd .",
    "the two observed fields are represented with boxes in fig .",
    "table 2 presents general information on the four observed galaxies .",
    "reduction of the data cubes were performed using the cigale / adhoc software ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data reduction procedure has been extensively described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "wavelength calibrations were obtained by scanning the narrow ne 6599   line under the same conditions as the observations .",
    "the relative velocities with respect to the systemic velocity are very accurate , with an error of a fraction of a channel width ( @xmath17 ) over the whole field .",
    "the signal measured along the scanning sequence was separated into two parts : ( 1 ) an almost constant level produced by the continuum light in a 24   passband around h@xmath18 ( continuum map ) , and ( 2 ) a varying part produced by the h@xmath18 line ( monochromatic map ) .",
    "the continuum level was taken to be the mean of the three faintest channels , to avoid channel noise effects .",
    "the monochromatic map was obtained by integrating the monochromatic profile in each pixel .",
    "the velocity sampling was 16 @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "the monochromatic maps had one - pixel resolution in the center of the galaxies .",
    "spectral profiles were binned in the outer parts ( to 5x5 pixels ) in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "oh night sky lines passing through the filters were subtracted by determining the level of emission away from the galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "a rough flux calibration of the monochromatic images was attempted by adjusting the flux levels to those of the calibrated image of the cartwheel galaxy , obtained in the same run ( see details of how the cartwheel galaxy image was calibrated in @xcite ) .",
    "profiles for the h16 galaxies were measured to a minimum flux density between 0.1 @xmath12 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath6@xmath20 arcsec@xmath21 and 0.7 @xmath12 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath6@xmath20 arcsec@xmath21 ( corresponding to a s / n between three and eight ) .",
    "fig . 1 is the i - band image of the group with contours obtained from the continuum images superimposed .",
    "h16a and h16b are on the top right of fig . 1 ( h16a is the galaxy further to the east ) .",
    "they have been morphologically classified as early - type spiral galaxies ( sbab and sab respectively ) by @xcite from inspection of ccd images .",
    "this classification is in general agreement with morphological classifications given by rhf91 and the rc3 .",
    "the morphologies of h16a and h16b have been described in detail by rhf91 .",
    "we confirm the central dust and the low - surface brightness tidal tails to the east ( and a shorter one to the south ) of h16a extending over 20 h@xmath6 kpc .",
    "@xcite detected three dwarf galaxy candidates on the eastern tail of h16a ( discussed in section 4.3 ) .",
    "for h16b , the subtraction of a model galaxy with concentric elliptical isophotes uncovered an asymmetric cone - like structure to the west of the galaxy .",
    "h16c and h16d , on the top and lower left of fig . 1 ,",
    "have been classified as irregular galaxies by @xcite and as s0 pec by @xcite ( the rc3 catalog ) .",
    "the amorphous shapes of these galaxies make it difficult to visually determine if they are either bulge or disk dominated systems .",
    "r - band images of the central parts of these two galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "h16c has two bright centers @xmath5 2@xmath3 apart ( see fig .",
    "the resolution of the fabry - perot image ( fig .",
    "9a ) is too low to separate the two nuclei .",
    "neither of the two bright nuclei coincide with the center of the outer ( outside of 10@xmath3 ) isophotes of the galaxy .",
    "a bright extension of @xmath5 5@xmath3 directly west from both centers is also detected ( see fig .",
    "this extension is seen in the r , i , continuum and monochromatic images .",
    "3 presents the surface brightness profiles of h16c obtained by fitting the galaxy with concentric elliptical isophotes .",
    "profiles are obtained from the emission - line image and continuum - image in order to check if reasonable fits can be found to exponential or de vaucouleurs r@xmath22 profiles .",
    "the data are plotted in linear scale ( radius in arcsec ) for the two curves to the left of the diagram and in radius to the power @xmath23 , for the two curves to the right of the diagram .",
    "the profiles are not well fit by an r@xmath22 or linear profile .",
    "it is evident , however , that the slope of the monochromatic profile ( gaseous component ) is steeper than the slope of the continuum image ( stellar component ) outside a radius of 5 arcsec .",
    "this is typical for gaseous disks in elliptical and lenticular galaxies .    a dust lane of @xmath5 30-arcsec diameter crosses h16c from southeast to northwest , at pa @xmath5 120@xmath24 ( all pa measurements are made from north to east ) .",
    "the galaxy contains patchy dust throughout its center ( within a radius of 10  15 arcsec ) . outside this radius",
    "the subtraction of a concentric - elliptical isophote - model shows clean residuals . at large radii h16c",
    "has non - concentric isophotes , whose centers are displaced in the direction of h16d ( fig .",
    "dust is also detected in h16d , inside the central 15-arcsec radius .",
    "in addition , h16d has a high surface brightness nucleus in the inner 2-arcsec radius ( fig .",
    "a `` bar - like feature '' is visible out to 5@xmath3 and is embedded in dust .",
    "these features are also present but seem to be less prominent in the i image .",
    "the effect of these features can be noted in the ellipticity , pa and cos ( 4@xmath25 ) r and i profiles shown in fig .",
    "4 , for the inner region of the galaxy .",
    "the surface - brightness profiles in the r and i filters agree well except for the cos ( 4@xmath25)-diagram . outside a radius of 8 arcsec",
    "the galaxy is very flat ( ellipticity=0.55 ) .",
    "the effect of the bright nucleus and of the central bar - like structure in the inner 2 and 5 arcsec respectively is to cause an increase in the galaxy ellipticity , a variation in the pa ( with two discontinuities ) and peaks in the cos ( 4@xmath25 ) profile .",
    "these peaks are much more prominent in the r than in the i - band images ( seen also in the cos ( 4@xmath25)-diagrams ) , due to the effect of dust .",
    "the very central region , shown in fig .",
    "4 is also where the h@xmath4 gas in emission is detected ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "h16d has a second nucleus @xmath5 7 @xmath3 east of the main nucleus .",
    "this double nucleus is uncovered in a k image of the galaxy ( mendes de oliveira , unpublished ) .",
    "it is not visible in either the r or i bands , due to obscuration by the dust .",
    "the r and i surface brightness profiles can be well described by a r@xmath22profile for radii greater than 8@xmath3 , out to 61@xmath3 ( at the lowest detectable isophote level of @xmath26 = 25 mag / arcsec@xmath27 ) .",
    "a fit to an r@xmath22profile gives an effective radius for this galaxy of 10.5 arcsec ( 2 h@xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "the ellipticity and pa profiles are approximately constant for radii between 8@xmath3 and 61@xmath3 ( not plotted ) at values of 0.55 and 84@xmath28 respectively .",
    "h16d shows pointed isophotes , which , at small radii , could be due to the central bar - like structure .",
    "however , this pointed morphology dominates the whole structure of the galaxy , and not only its central part , where the bar - like feature is detected .      * the data : figs .",
    "5 to 12 show the monochromatic images , the velocity fields ( vfs ) of @xmath29 and the rotation curves ( rcs ) for galaxies h16a , b , c and d. the rotational velocities plotted have not been adjusted by the cosmological correction ( _  1  +  z  _ ) . *",
    "detailed discussion on the method used to obtain the systemic velocity , center , pa of the major axis and inclination of the galaxy are given in @xcite .",
    "advantages of fabry - perot observations in the study of galaxy kinematics are also discussed in that paper and in @xcite .      the pattern of the vf of h16a plotted in fig .",
    "5 is regular .",
    "the grand design of the isovelocity lines describe a normal rotating disk with differential rotation .",
    "morphologically , h16a is a barred galaxy and the signature of the bar is visible in the central parts of the vf .",
    "the classical distortions of the isovelocity lines when crossing a spiral arm are clearly seen all along the arms .",
    "the rc of h16a shown in fig .",
    "6 was plotted taking into account all velocity points except those within @xmath30 of the galaxy minor axis .",
    "the cloud of small points represents the portion of measured velocities within @xmath31 of the major axis in the plane of the sky .",
    "this gives a fair idea of the quality of our data .",
    "the mean rc of h16a ( obtained by averaging both sides of the galaxy ) is flat from 2@xmath3 to the limit of our measurements at @xmath5 30@xmath3 . in the outer 5@xmath3 small discrepancies between the two sides",
    "these are mainly due to the effects of the spiral arms .",
    "the plateau is reached within the inner 0.2 @xmath32 kpc - radius . the steep slope ( fast rise ) of the central rc is a typical signature of a bulgy galaxy .",
    "rhf91 found a peculiar gas velocity pattern for h16a . outside a radius of 16@xmath3 ,",
    "the rotation curve rises on one side of the galaxy and falls on the other .",
    "these points are also plotted on fig .",
    "we do not confirm this result .",
    "we conclude that the rc of h16a is flat out to a 6.5 @xmath32 kpc - radius ( 0.9 r@xmath7 ) and that the mass distribution does not seem perturbed by any interaction or merging in the group , inside this radius .",
    "the @xmath29 emission in h16b is very weak and clumpy ( see fig .",
    "the monochromatic map and the vf extend to a radius of @xmath33 ( 5.8 h@xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "the total integrated flux is f(h@xmath34 ) = 0.8 @xmath12 10@xmath35 erg s @xmath6 @xmath20 .",
    "the extended emission - line gas lies in a disk of inclination 72@xmath28 @xmath36 3@xmath28 and position angle 70@xmath28 @xmath36 3@xmath28 .",
    "these parameters are used to derive the rc plotted in fig .",
    "this plot shows that the rotation curve for h16b is non - axisymmetric .",
    "the northeastern side reaches a minimum velocity of 73 km s@xmath6 while the southwestern side reaches a maximum velocity of 173 km s@xmath6 . in the central parts of the galaxy",
    "the rotation curve rises very slowly compared to those of other spiral galaxies .",
    "rhf91 obtained a rotation curve for this galaxy , from measurements of the h@xmath4 and [ nii ] gas along the photometric major axis .",
    "their results , completely different from ours , are overplotted on fig .",
    "they found that the rotation is in the opposite sense of what we measure .",
    "we have re - checked the raw data and have confirmed the sense of rotation .",
    "we can not explain the discrepancy between the results .",
    "the rcs derived from the fabry - perot maps are based on the average of many more measurements ( @xmath5 500 in this case ) than for the long - slit determinations .",
    "the vf and the monochromatic image obtained for h16c were derived from good signal - to - noise data ( s / n @xmath5 30200 ) , inside a 13@xmath3-radius . as can be seen from fig .",
    "9a , the h@xmath4 emission for h16c is strongly peaked in the central region , although it can be detected out to a 30@xmath3-radius ( 6 h@xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "the h@xmath4 flux goes from 32 @xmath12 @xmath37 to 36 @xmath12 @xmath38 if integrated within the 13@xmath3 or the 30@xmath3-radius .",
    "close to 90 @xmath39 of the h@xmath4-emitting gas mass of the galaxy is within the inner 13@xmath3 radius .",
    "the vf of h16c is reasonably regular , except for the presence of a possible second component to the southwest of the galaxy ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "the analysis of the vf of h16c indicates that the extended emission - line gas lies in a disk of inclination 60@xmath28 @xmath36 5@xmath28 and position angle 120@xmath28 @xmath36 8@xmath28 .",
    "the morphology of the line - emitting region is decoupled from that of the continuum - light distribution ( fig .",
    "kinematic decoupling between gas and stars is also observed ( fig . 9b and section 3.3 ) .",
    "the rc for h16c is plotted in fig .",
    "10a for a major - axis pa of 120@xmath24 , an inclination of 60@xmath24 and the center measured from the vf .",
    "the rotation curve resembles that of a gas disk in differential rotation .",
    "the amplitude of the rc of the gas is similar for the receding and approaching sides of the galaxy .",
    "the presence of a second gas component does not significantly disturb the shape of the rotation curve as described by the main body of the galaxy ( when the center and pa of the major axis are determined from the vf ) .    in order to compare our results with the result of rhf91 , we plotted in fig . 10b a rc with the center and pa derived from the r image . in that study the photometric major axis of the galaxy",
    "was used to position the long - slit .",
    "it is clear that along the photometric major axis of the galaxy the shape of the rc is `` sinusoidal '' , mainly because the second gas component is crossed .",
    "10b resembles the rc determined by rhf91 , from long - slit spectroscopy of the gas in emission . a detailed discussion of fig .",
    "10 is in section 4.1 .",
    "the emission in h16d is much less extended than for the other three galaxies and also strongly peaked . the monochromatic map and the vf ( plotted in fig .",
    "11 ) extend to radii of @xmath5 10 @xmath3 and @xmath5 6@xmath3 respectively .",
    "analysis of the vf of h16d indicates that the gas lies on a disk of inclination 47@xmath28 @xmath36 5@xmath28 and position angle 70@xmath28 @xmath36 8@xmath28 .",
    "these parameters are used to build the rc shown in fig .",
    "this rc shows an extension of only @xmath36 5@xmath3 on each side of the galaxy .",
    "the maximum velocity is 110 @xmath36 7 km s@xmath6 , reached after 5 @xmath3 ( 1 h@xmath6 kpc ) . in the northeast side , the curve reaches a maximum and then falls to about 60 @xmath36 5 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this side of the curve may be affected by the presence of a second nucleus , 7@xmath3 east of the bright central nucleus . in fig .",
    "11 the position of the second nucleus is indicated in both pannels by a cross .",
    "h16c displays the largest misalignment between the kinematic axis inferred from the gas motions and the photometric ( major ) axis measured from the stellar light ( 40@xmath24 ) followed by h16b ( 16@xmath24 ) and h16d ( 14@xmath24 ) . for h16a the kinematic and stellar axes",

    "if falling rotation curves are common in compact groups , this would suggest that the individual dark matter halos are absent most probably because they were stripped by interactions .",
    "in particular both h16c and h16d were reported to have sinusoidal rcs , from measurements of the kinematics of the gas obtained through long - slit spectra taken along the photometric major axis of the galaxies . having the 2-d vfs of the galaxies we can check on the reality of the sinusoidal shapes of the rcs .",
    "10 shows two possible rcs for h16c ( described in section 3.2.3 ) .",
    "10b was built with the same parameters used by rhf91 , i.e. , pa=78@xmath28 and the center coinciding with the optical / continuum center .",
    "this curve clearly has a sinusoidal shape , in agreement with the curve presented in rhf91 .",
    "the rotation curve of h16c plotted using the kinematical center , inclination and position angle ( fig .",
    "10a and see  3.3 for how these quantities are defined and derived ) has a fairly normal shape typical of a disk in differential rotation .",
    "the sinusoidal rotation curve derived through long - slit spectroscopy ( fig .",
    "10b ) along the photometric major axis of h16c was caused by a misalignment between the gas and stellar components and the presence of a second kinematic component .",
    "there are a number of merger - candidates in the literature previously found to have sinusoidal rotation curves .",
    "it would be interesting to review these cases with a full 2-d velocity field analysis ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the case of h16b and h16d",
    "it is not possible to make their rotation curves look normal by changing the center or the position angle along which the curve is plotted .",
    "h16b has the peculiarity of having one side ( the northeast ) with a much lower velocity amplitude than the other side , while for h16d the velocity curve reaches a maximum and drops on both sides .",
    "dynamical processes may have worked very efficiently in hcg 16 , as exemplified by the high frequency of interaction indicators found for all member galaxies .",
    "it is of interest to investigate if the `` damage '' due to interactions and merging was large enough to affect the position of the galaxies in the tully - fisher or fundamental - plane relations .    in order to check if h16a , h16c and h16d follow the tf relation we have used the plots in figs .",
    "6 , 10 and 12 to estimate the shape and amplitude of the rotational velocity curves and we have then compared these with `` template curves '' based on the tf relation for normal galaxies ( rhf91 , fig .",
    "no attempt is made to check if h16b follows the tf relation since the two sides of its rotation curve do not coincide .",
    "h16a has a normal velocity amplitude for its luminosity , following the tf relation . for the main disk component of h16c",
    "the measured v@xmath53 is also within the expected value , for a galaxy of this luminosity ( see fig . 5 of rhf91 and table 2 ) . a similar exercise , for h16d shows that v@xmath53 is @xmath54 of the value expected for a normal galaxy of this luminosity , if the inclination given by the velocity field ( inclination = 47@xmath28 ) or r image ( inclination=57@xmath28 ) is used .",
    "there is a chance , however that the flattening of the velocity curve for h16d is due to dust .",
    "alternatively there could be problems in obtaining dynamical information about gravity from the measured gas properties in the inner 5 @xmath3 of an interacting galaxy .",
    "dynamical information from the stars would be much more reliable in this case .",
    "the surface - brightness of h16d follows an r@xmath22-profile , typical of early - type galaxies .",
    "it is , therefore , of interest to check if it follows the r@xmath55 vs. @xmath56 relation , a projection of the fundamental - plane relation , observed for bulges and elliptical galaxies . with the values of r@xmath57 = 10.5 and @xmath56 = 21.1 mag arcsec@xmath21",
    ", we find that h16d follows the fundamental plane relations of normal field galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of r images of hickson compact groups by @xcite yielded a sample of 47 candidate dwarf galaxies that may be associated with tidal arms and tails in interacting and merging galaxies .",
    "if the majority of these dwarf - galaxy candidates are confirmed as being gravitationally bound stellar systems , these authors estimated that a significant fraction ( perhaps as much as one - half ) of the dwarf population in compact groups is created in mergers occurred in the giant parent galaxies .",
    "three dwarf candidates are suggested by @xcite to sit on the eastern tail of h16a .",
    "two of the candidates were observed in our fields .",
    "we checked if emission lines are associated to the candidates . in both cases ,",
    "the emission - line map has a s / n twice higher on the corresponding pixels then in the direct neighbourhood of these pixels .",
    "we therefore confirm these may be star - forming knots at the redshift of the group .",
    "however , no conclusive information can be obtained from the examination of the velocity field , the line - width and the equivalent - line - width maps , due to insufficient s / n .",
    "we conclude that the `` dwarf candidates '' are at the same redshift of the group but we can not exclude the possibility that they are material connected to the main galaxies . longer exposure and higher spatial resolution are necessary to confirm the nature of the emission , if these are galaxies formed in interactions or just part of the main galaxy which will fall back in a few crossing times .      [",
    "[ a - census - of - the - interaction - related - properties - for - the - h16-galaxies ] ] a census of the interaction - related properties for the h16 galaxies ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    there are a number of `` interaction indicators '' that have been suggested over the years .",
    "these have been used to attempt to discern the different types of interactions ( primarily tidal interactions vs. merging ) that can occur between galaxies and are generally based on models of colliding systems .",
    "close tidal encounters which do _ not _ lead to merging can strongly affect the interstellar medium of the colliders , can trigger strong bursts of star formation on a timescale of a few 10@xmath58 years but can only mildly affect the _ kinematics _ of the central velocity fields of the colliding galaxies . in a merger , on the other hand ,",
    "even if the two nuclei have not yet mixed completely , the regular kinematic structure of the disks disappear and the velocity fields may display strong signatures of the collision ( e.g. the antennae galaxies , @xcite , n7252 , @xcite ) .",
    "we , therefore , use the indicator `` highly disturbed velocity field '' as one of our definite evidences for a merger .",
    "central double nuclei and/or double kinematic gas components are other definite indicators of mergers .",
    "double nuclei are present , for example , in the well known mergers , the antennae galaxy ( @xcite ) , n520 ( @xcite ) and iras 23128 - 5919 ( @xcite ) and double kinematic gas components are present in iras 23128 - 5919 , the cartwheel galaxy ( @xcite ) , hcg 31 and several other obvious merger candidates .",
    "we list as interaction indicators for collisions which do not necessarily lead to merging the following properties : kinematic warping , gaseous and stellar major axes misalignments , tidal tails , high infrared luminosity and central activity .",
    "although the presence of tidal tails and plumes are common in mergers and they are often taken as evidence for a major accretion event , we group it with the indicators of mild interaction since they can also be formed in interactions which do not lead to mergers .",
    "kinematic and photometric major axes misalignment and kinematic warping are properties that are also usually associated with galaxy collisions . in a sample of 75 normal spiral galaxies studied by @xcite , for which velocity fields were available , only a very small fraction of the galaxies showed kinematic warping and/or small gaseous / stellar major axes misalignments .",
    "another indicator listed in table 3 is `` high infrared luminosities '' .",
    "certainly not all strongly interacting galaxies have high ir luminosities but most ir loud galaxies have disturbed morphologies .",
    "finally , `` central activity '' is taken as an interaction indicator .",
    "although there is not a one - to - one correlation between interactions and central activity , there are several lines of evidence that strongly suggest that interactions may drive nuclear inflows and fuel central activity in interacting systems .",
    "the data presented in this paper support the existence of a regular gaseous rotating disk in the center of galaxies h16a , b , c and d. h16c may contain two disks .",
    "based on the interaction indicators for each galaxy listed in table 3 and in the context of the various models of galaxy interactions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) we suggest the following histories for the h16 galaxies .    * h16a : * this galaxy does not present any of the indicators common to merging galaxies , listed in table 3 .",
    "it has a normal mass distribution inside a radius of 30 arcsec and it does not contain any multiple nuclei or gas components . at large radii , however , the galaxy looks morphologically disturbed and shows tidal tails to the east and south . although numerical models of compact groups suggest that galaxies with extended tidal tails are excellent candidate mergers ( fig . 1 of @xcite ) , the grand - design isovelocity lines of h16a with no signs of disturbances inside a radius of @xmath5 r@xmath7 strongly suggest that this galaxy has not yet suffered a major merger .",
    "an interaction between galaxies h16a and h16b is very probable .",
    "the difference in systemic velocities between these two galaxies is less than 200 km s@xmath6 and their isophotes overlap .",
    "the normality of the velocity field of this galaxy compared with the peculiarities observed for the velocity fields of the other three very kinematically disturbed companions , leads us to the conclusion this may be a fairly new member to the heart of the group .",
    "* h16b : * although h16b is classified as an sb galaxy , it has a velocity field which is very peculiar , unlike that observed for any other normal spiral galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "strong warp of the kinematic major axis , misalignment between the optical and kinematic axes and a very slow rise in the velocities in the inner regions of the galaxies are obvious peculiarities related to past or ongoing interactions .",
    "in addition , the blue and red sides of its velocity curve do not match in shape nor in amplitude and its visual morphology is asymmetric , although smooth and `` well behaved '' ( if compared with the morphologies of other merger remnants ) .",
    "the close proximity of h16a and the overlapping isophotes with this galaxy suggest a clear ongoing interaction . h16b has little ionized gas compared to the other members of the group studied here ( table 2 ) . also the mass of molecular gas is four times smaller than the average value for the other members .",
    "it is the one galaxy from the four studied here that is not detected at radio or infrared wavelengths .",
    "although h16b does not show a double nucleus or a double gas system , which would be a clear sign of an ongoing merger , the very disturbed velocity field calls for a scenario where strong interactions or accretion events have occurred in the past , which have , however , left the disky morphology of the galaxy intact .",
    "a gas - poor accretion event is possible , given the lack of gas in h16b . the scarcity of gas and consequent low s /",
    "n of the data did not allow detection of a double gas component , if it was present .",
    "in addition to having suffered accretion events h16b may be involved in an on - going interaction with h16a , which may result in a major merger . unlike the two ongoing mergers in h16 ( h16c and h16d , see below ) the warm gas content of h16b is not concentrated to the center of the galaxy .",
    "* h16c : * this galaxy is clearly an ongoing starburst merging system .",
    "it presents seven indicators ( all but `` tidal tails '' ) for strong interactions and mergers , according to table 3 .",
    "the vf of h16c shows the existence of a second velocity component to the southwest of the galaxy , closely spaced in velocity and position to the main component",
    ". the observed kinematic warp and misalignment between gas and stars are strong evidences for external accretion of the central ionized gas in h16c .",
    "its infrared luminosity is comparable to that of other mergers ( log l@xmath59 = 11.6 l@xmath60 ) .",
    "the morphology of the galaxy as a whole is amorphous .",
    "no disks or spiral arms or tails are seen down to a surface brightness limit of r @xmath43 25 mag arcsec@xmath21 .",
    "the shapes of the continuum and monochromatic images of h16c ( fig .",
    "4 ) indicate that the emission - line isophotes are significantly flatter than the isophotes of the underlying stellar component , typical of early - type galaxies .",
    "however , the light profile of the galaxy does not follow an r@xmath22 law as is common for relaxed mergers .",
    "the kinematics of h16c resembles that of the merger remnant n6240 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the overall optical morphology of h16c , however , is much less peculiar than that of n6240 or of any other ongoing merger remnant from the toomre and toomre s sequence .",
    "it is possible that pre - existing tidal arms or tails were quickly ripped apart by the dynamical forces within the compact group , a situation which is unlikely to happen in less dense environments ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively tidal tails may have never been formed .",
    "the hi map of the group ( williams , private communication ) shows a strong connection between galaxies h16c and h16d .",
    "it also shows that the centers of the hi contours are displaced from the optical centers of h16c and h16d by almost one optical radius , in the direction of the line that joins the centers of these two galaxies .",
    "* h16d : * this galaxy may also be a merger remnant .",
    "it presents five of the eight indicators of interactions and mergers , from table 3 .",
    "double kinematic gas component , kinematic warping and tidal tails are not detected for this galaxy .",
    "the first two indicators are not observed probably due to the small range in radii where the gas kinematics can be measured .",
    "the lack of tidal tails is common to all mergers in group h16 and may be a common feature of mergers in compact groups in general .",
    "h16d has a double nucleus and a peculiar velocity field .",
    "it has a high infrared luminosity ( log l@xmath59 = 11.7 l@xmath60 ) , similar to that of other mergers . outside a radius of 8 arcsec the light profiles of the galaxy ( in the r and i bands )",
    "follow an r@xmath22-profile with an r@xmath55 of 10.5 arcsec . in the inner parts",
    "the galaxy profiles flatten , as is typical of the mass profiles of modeled merger remnants ( eg .",
    "h16d has a peculiar bar - like structure in the central 10@xmath3 which coincides with the peaked ionized gas , molecular gas and dust components .",
    "the rotation curve of h16d peaks and falls on both sides within the inner 2 h@xmath6 kpc region .",
    "we do not have kinematical information on the second nucleus , which lies 7 arcsec to the east of the main nucleus .",
    "the second nucleus is only seen in the nir due to obscuration from dust in the optical .",
    "the h@xmath4 emission in h16d ( and in h16c also ) is strongly spatially concentrated , in qualitative agreement with the results of simulations of gaseous collisions , in which the gas is driven towards the nucleus of the galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
