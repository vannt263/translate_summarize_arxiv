    "ammonia , nh@xmath0 , is a common molecule in ice giant planets , which appear to be found widely throughout the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of ammonia is therefore important for our understanding of planetary structures and their evolution , potentially to pressures of order 1tpa for the base of the ice - rock interface in icy exoplanets .",
    "an accurate eos for ammonia is also needed for studies of hypervelocity impacts , such as meteoroid collisions with ice giants .",
    "furthermore , ammonia is a simple prototype for bonds occurring in chemical explosives , for which densities from up to around twice that of zero - pressure solids are of interest for shock initiation and detonation .",
    "although shock compression experiments have been performed on ammonia to pressures of several tens of gigapascals @xcite , the only equation of state readily available is sesame 5520 @xcite , based on national bureau of standards gas phase data @xcite , and is tabulated to a maximum density of 0.765g/@xmath1 , which is barely greater than the zero - pressure density for liquid ammonia .",
    "quasistatic compression experiments have been performed in which the density and sound speed were measured along isotherms @xcite , but the highest pressures reported have reached only a few gigapascals .",
    "shock experiments have been reported previously in which the shock and particle speeds @xmath2 and @xmath3 were measured for a range of shock pressures , for liquid ammonia at an initial temperature of 203k @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hugupus ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath2 and @xmath3 were approximately 1% .",
    "these data can be fitted by a straight line fit @xmath4 with @xmath5 where the standard errors shown are from the residual fitting error , neglecting the uncertainty in measurement .",
    "the experimental measurements exhibited a slightly curved trend , but the number of points was not great enough to justify a higher - order fit . solving the rankine - hugoniot equations for a steady shock @xcite using the fitted parameters rather than the individual shock measurements , the highest shock pressure was 38.6gpa , giving a mass density of 1.54g/@xmath1 .",
    "the observed sound speed in liquid ammonia at 203k is 1.9535km / s @xcite , which is consistent with the extrapolated hugoniot data .",
    "[ fig : hugupus ] )        various universal eos have been proposed for different classes of material .",
    "it is interesting to compare with the ` universal liquid eos ' of @xcite , whose only material - specific parameter is the sound speed at zero pressure .",
    "this eos does not reproduce the shock data for ammonia , which is softer and more linear than the universal eos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hugupus ] ) .",
    "the fit to the shock hugoniot can be used to predict the mechanical equation of state , using the hugoniot as a reference curve @xcite @xmath6 \\\\ p_r(\\rho ) & = & { \\displaystyle\\frac{c_0 ^ 2\\rho_r\\rho(\\rho-\\rho_r)}{\\left[\\rho+s_1(\\rho-\\rho_r)\\right]^2 } } \\\\",
    "e_r(\\rho ) & = & e_0 + \\frac 12 p_r(\\rho)\\left(\\frac 1{\\rho_r}-\\frac 1\\rho\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the initial density on the reference curve , and @xmath8 was derived for zero initial pressure , as here .",
    "other experiments are required to determine @xmath9 , such as sound speed measurements on the hugoniot , a shock hugoniot from a different initial state , or ramp compression .",
    "however , @xmath10 can be estimated from the slope of the shock hugoniot as @xmath11 , which is accurate for cubic crystals @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath12g/@xmath1 and @xmath13 .",
    "given the mechanical eos , the isentrope through any state can be calculated by integrating the @xmath14 work numerically @xcite .",
    "isentropes calculated from grnseisen eos fitted to shock data typically behave unphysically at high compression , where the assumption that the grneisen parameter is a function of density only breaks down . for the ammonia fit , the breakdown occurred at a mass density of 2.145g/@xmath1 .",
    "the isentrope was well - behaved to several terapascals , though its accuracy was undetermined .",
    "the isentrope should be reasonably accurate at least up to the peak compression in the shock data , which equates to 22.1gpa on the isentrope . to investigate the sensitivity to the grneisen parameter",
    ", isentropes were calculated for the nominal value above , and for values 10%  lower and higher . with this variation in @xmath10 , the pressure varied by 10%  at 20gpa , rising to 25%  at 500gpa .",
    "[ fig : isendp ] )",
    "mass - radius relationships were calculated using the deduced eos , for a self - gravitating body comprising pure ammonia and also for differentiated bodies consisting of a rocky core and an ammonia mantle , using the numerical methods described previously @xcite .",
    "separate mass - radius curves were constructed for the nominal and perturbed values of the grneisen parameter . in all cases ,",
    "the temperature at the surface was taken to be 203k , to match the initial state in the shock experiments .",
    "the rocky core was modeled using an eos for basalt , sesame 7530 @xcite , as was done previously @xcite .",
    "the variations in @xmath10 made a negligible difference to the mass - radius relations . at high masses ,",
    "the mass - radius relation for pure ammonia asymptoted to a power - law behavior @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for an incompressible material , @xmath18 giving @xmath19 .",
    "the difference in the fitted value is small but significant ; @xmath20 is considerably less than the incompressible value of @xmath21 .",
    "the mass - radius relation was also deduced using the sesame eos , which matched that from the grneisen eos up to 0.1m@xmath22 , above which point the extrapolation beyond the bounds of the table gave unphysical behavior .",
    "( figs  [ fig : mr ] to [ fig : diffmr ] . )                the planetary radius for pure ammonia did not exhibit a maximum within the range of masses investigated .",
    "the range of compressions explored by the shock experiments was equivalent to the central pressure in bodies of pure ammonia up to around 2/3m@xmath22(1.5r@xmath22 ) .",
    "however , the mass - radius relation is accurate for significantly larger bodies , because the mass and volume are dominated by matter at much lower pressures until the average density exceeds 1.5g/@xmath1 or so : approximately 4m@xmath22 , 2.5r@xmath22 , and a core pressure of 100gpa .",
    "the relation may be accurate for even larger bodies , but it has not been validated by eos experiments .",
    "the relation between shock and particle speeds in liquid ammonia appears linear to within the scatter in the data up to pressures of at least 39gpa .",
    "a grneisen mechanical equation of state was constructed using the principal hugoniot of initial state zero pressure and 203k as a reference , and estimating the grneisen parameter @xmath10 from the slope of the hugoniot .",
    "isentropes were calculated through the same state , the sensitivity to @xmath10 rising with pressure .",
    "mass - radius relations were calculated for self - gravitating bodies consisting of ammonia , and differentiated ammonia - rock mixtures .",
    "the mass - radius relations were insensitive to variations in @xmath10 , indicating that the relations should be reliable for comparison to planetary measurements , to central pressures substantially above those reached in the shock experiments .",
