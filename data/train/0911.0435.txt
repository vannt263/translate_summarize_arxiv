    "accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars ( amxps ) are rapidly spinning neutron stars accreting matter from a low - mass stellar companion .",
    "these systems are thought to be the progenitors of the millisecond radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "therefore , their study allows us to better understand how neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) evolve into radio millisecond pulsars .",
    "furthermore , amxps are perfect laboratories to study the interaction between the neutron star magnetosphere and the accretion disk ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a total of ten amxps among the @xmath3 neutron star lmxbs were known by august 2009 .",
    "seven of these amxps showed outbursts lasting a few days to months , and recurrence times of at least  2 years . in all seven cases ,",
    "the pulsations were detected persistently during the whole outburst .",
    "the remaining three amxps showed pulsations only intermittently @xcite , bridging the gap between the small number of amxps and the large group of non - pulsating lmxbs @xcite .",
    "the reason why only a small amount of neutron star lmxbs show pulsations is still under debate .",
    "one of the proposed scenarios for the non - pulsating systems is that the neutron - star magnetic field could be temporarily buried by the accreted matter @xcite .",
    "if the time - averaged mass accretion rate of the accretors is relatively high , the accreted matter can bury the field throughout the life of the x - ray binary so the neutron star does not pulsate .",
    "however , if the average accretion rate is low enough that the magnetic field can diffuse through the accreted matter faster than it is buried , then these systems will probably exhibit pulsations .",
    "another of the proposed scenarios that explains why the majority of neutron stars in lmxbs do not pulsate is that of @xcite ; if neutron stars undergo long periods of accretion ( at high rates ) , then their magnetic poles are naturally forced to align to their spin axes as they spin up .",
    "when the accretion rate decreases , the magnetic poles can move away from the rotation axis ( due to magnetic dipole and other braking torques which cause neutron stars to spin down ) and oscillations powered by accretion should become visible .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite present clear predictions : we should find pulsations in many ( if not all ) of the systems which show low time - averaged mass accretion rates . very recently , a chandra x - ray observation serendipitously discovered a new x - ray transient in the globular cluster ngc  6440 ( * ? ? ?",

    "the frequency drifts we observe are consistent with an orbital period of 57.3 minutes and a semi - major axis ( @xmath44 sin@xmath45 ) of 6.22 light - msec , which shows that this new amxp is in an ultra - compact binary system .",
    "the characteristics of this new pulsar are similar to those of other amxps , particularly swift j1756.92508 @xcite , which showed pulsations at a frequency of 182  hz , an orbital period of 54.7 minutes , a projected semi - major axis of 5.94 lt - ms and a minimum companion mass of 0.0067 m@xmath1 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , such a low mass for a companion in this type of system is probably inconsistent with brown dwarf models while white dwarf models suggest that the companion is probably a he - dominated donor .",
    "the reason why only twelve ns lmxbs exhibit coherent pulsations out of about 100 systems is still unclear .",

    "this is consistent with the general tendency and furthermore , with the theoretical predictions @xcite that a significant fraction ( if not all ) of the ns lmxb systems with low time - averaged accretion rates harbor accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "the outburst durations ( @xmath26 days ) of the newly discovered amxp are short compared with those of the other amxps , although not uniquely so .",

    "our discovery of ngc  6440 x-2 indicates that there might exist a population of amxps undergoing weak outbursts .",
    "unfortunately , short low - luminosity outbursts can not be detected with the current all - sky x - ray monitors ( e.g. , asm aboard rxte ) .",
    "more sensitive instruments like the `` monitor of all - sky x - ray image '' ( maxi , which should detect x - ray  230 kev  sources of about 20 mcrab from 90 minutes observations , and sources of about 4.5 mcrab after a day observation , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will probably allow us to discover many more potential low - luminosity amxps .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , ngc  6440 x-2 has been in outburst at least five times in the last 250 days .",

    "if ngc  6440 x-2 continues undergoing this type of short outbursts and rxte is able to observe them , then ngc  6440 x-2 has the potential to be the best millisecond x - ray pulsar in which to study the evolution of the binary as well as that of the neutron star spin ( by means of coherent timing analysis ) .",
    "the globular cluster ngc  6440 is known for having at least 24 faint x - ray sources to a limiting luminosity of @xmath7 ergs s@xmath5 ( 0.52.5 kev , see * ? ? ?",

    "none of the known radio pulsars match the position ( nor the characteristics ) of ngc  6440 x-2 .",
    "although millisecond radio pulsars in binary systems have been found in other globular clusters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
