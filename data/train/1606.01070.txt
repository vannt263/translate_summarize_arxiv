    "( [ solitonnumber ] ) ] . in a static thermodynamics view , this is a sudden transition between metastable and stable solutions .",

    "consequently , even if for a given @xmath96 there are solutions that are energetically favorable , the system is dynamically frozen in a metastable one .",
    "although this _ per se _ explains why by increasing @xmath102 some lobes vanish until new solitons can enter the junction , we can go beyond by looking at the solitons arrangement along the junction when the magnetic field is swept .",
    "+ for the sake of symmetry , we first observe that in the midpoint of the system , i.e. , @xmath126 , the local field @xmath127 can be exclusively a local maximum ( accordingly , a soliton is pinned in the center of the junction and the total amount of solitons is odd ) or a local minimum ( the total amount of solitons is even ) ( see curves in figs .  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig5 ] for @xmath126 ) . as the local field at the midpoint , i.e. , @xmath128 , sudden switches from a minimum to a maximum ( or vice versa ) , the diffraction patterns abruptly jumps and , accordingly",
    ", the soliton number @xmath79 suddenly changes by one .",
    "+ due to the symmetry of the system , as the intensity of the magnetic field increases , the solitons set along the junction are shifted towards its center . for low fields ,",
    "this shift is strongly affected by the damping , so that solitons are less and less pushed by the external field as the damping increases .",
    "let s suppose that the junction contains an even number of solitons .",
    "when the external field value is such that a new pair of solitons is injected , if the two solitons near the center are close enough they can merge in a midpoint soliton . correspondingly , the total amount @xmath79 of solitons gets odd .",
    "however , high damping can prevent this phenomenon , so that , as a result of the solitons injection , @xmath79 changes by two and the total amount of solitons remains even .",
    "we have seen that the dissipative dynamics is crucial to understand the junction diffraction patterns . in general , the dissipative dynamics depends on the full evolution of the system .",
    "therefore , it is natural to wonder if the heat diffraction pattern changes with the history of the system .    to answer this question ,",
    "we have implemented a double - swept drive .",
    "the external `` staircase '' field @xmath96 is ramped up from @xmath129 to @xmath130 , then reduced to @xmath131 and subsequently raised again to zero . the corresponding heat diffraction pattern is shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig6 ] ( a ) , for @xmath108 and @xmath103 . as we can see , the forward , i.e. , with @xmath96 increasing , and the backward , i.e. , with @xmath96 decreasing , patterns are significantly different . for a given value of the magnetic field ,",
    "the heat transferred in the backward and forward evolutions are usually different and the system is found in a different diffraction lobe .",
    "following fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we can associate the forward and backward stable states ( at fixed @xmath96 ) with a different number of solitons in the junction .    the explanation of this difference can be found again in the damped dynamics .",
    "suppose that , for a given @xmath96 , we have @xmath132 solitons in the junction , so that new solitons are injected into ( extracted from ) the system by increasing ( decreasing ) the magnetic field .",
    "let s also assume that injection of solitons occurs for @xmath133 , so that now @xmath134 solitons set in the junction . in the backward evolution , when @xmath96 reaches the value @xmath135 , the dissipation terms opposes to the phase variations , so that @xmath136-solitons solutions can still be the most favorable ones .",
    "therefore , the system remains in the @xmath134 lobe even if @xmath135 is passed .",
    "this effect generates the asymmetry between the forward and backward evolution .",
    "interestingly , the overall effect is a hysteric behavior in the heat power [ see fig .  [ fig6](a ) ] .",

    "the phase dynamics is analyzed within the sine - gordon ( sg ) framework with proper boundary conditions modeling a slowly - changing external magnetic field .",
    "we have shown the lobes structure of the heat current diffraction patterns , which is closely related to the josephson vortices , i.e. , solitons , injections through the edges and arrangement along the jj length .",
    "the amount of solitons set along the system depends mainly on the junction length and the magnetic field intensity , but we observed modifications in the diffraction patterns when the value of the parameter @xmath102 , describing the damping of the system , is increased .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood by leaving the pure thermodynamical picture of the problem , and exploring the full dynamics of the sg model . moreover",
    ", the study of the full evolution of the system disclosed a clear hysteretic effect as a function of @xmath96 in both the diffraction pattern and the magnetic flux per unit area through the junction .",
    "finally , we analyzed noise - induced effects in the diffraction patterns by including a gaussian thermal noise source into the sg model .",
    "+ the proposed systems could be easily implemented by standard nanofabrication techniques through the setup proposed for the short jjs - based thermal diffractor  @xcite . besides being relevant from a fundamental physics viewpoint , the studied thermally - biased long jj represents the first effort to combine the physics of solitons and the emerging superconducting coherent caloritronics , e.g. , the implementation of josephson - based heat memories .",
