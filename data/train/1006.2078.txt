    "the indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 label the generations and @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to the chirality of the quark fields .",
    "the yukawa couplings for up - type and down - type quarks are @xmath12 matrices in flavour space , denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) entails the mass matrices @xmath15 the diagonalisations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 involve four unitary rotations in flavour space , one each for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . since the left - handed fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which were originally members of a common su(2 ) doublet , undergo different rotations , the electroweak su(2 ) symmetry is no more manifest in the physical basis in which mass matrices are diagonal .",
    "the mismatch between the rotations of the left - handed fields defines the unitary cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite , @xmath24 the ckm elements occur in the couplings of the @xmath25 boson , because the @xmath25 e.g.  couples the @xmath26 field to the linear combination @xmath27 as a consequence of the unitary rotations in flavour space .",
    "@xmath28 can be parametrised in terms of three angles and one phase , the cp - violating kobayashi - maskawa phase @xmath29 @xcite . with a history of more than 50 years , research in quark flavour",
    "has been essential for the construction of the standard model , having guided us to phenomena which were `` new physics '' at their time : highlights were the breakdown of the discrete symmetries p @xcite and cp @xcite , the prediction of the charm quark @xcite and its mass @xcite , and a heavy top quark predicted from the size of @xmath0  mixing@xcite . in the decade behind us",
    "the asymmetric b factories belle and babar have consolidated the ckm picture of quark flavour physics . with the advent of the lhc era",
    ", the focus of flavour physics has shifted from ckm metrology to physics beyond the standard model . in the standard model flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc )",
    "processes ( such as meson - antimeson mixing , @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) are forbidden at tree - level and only occur through highly suppressed one - loop diagrams .",
    "fcnc processes are therefore excellent probes of new physics .",
    "this is a strong rationale to complement the high-@xmath32 physics programs at atlas and cms with precision flavour physics at lhcb , na62 , belle - ii , super - b , bes - iii , j - parc and the future intense proton source project x at fermilab .    with the discovery of neutrino flavour oscillations , the much younger field of lepton flavour physics has emerged .",
    "the standard model in its original formulation @xcite lacks a right - handed neutrino field and can neither accommodate neutrino masses nor neutrino oscillations .",
    "the simplest remedy for this is the introduction of a dimension-5 yukawa term composed of two lepton doublets @xmath33 and two higgs doublets leading to majorana masses for the neutrinos and generating the desired lepton flavour mixing .",
    "alternatively one can mimic the quark sector by introducing right - handed neutrino fields ( and imposing @xmath34 , the difference between baryon and lepton numbers , as an exact symmetry ) . with both variants fcnc transitions among charged leptons ( such as @xmath35 )",
    "are unobservably small , so that any observation of such a process will imply the existence of further new particles .",
    "charged - lepton fcnc decays are currently searched for in the dedicated meg experiment ( studying @xmath35 ) , in b factory data ( on e.g.  @xmath36 ) and at three of the four major lhc experiments ( searching e.g.  for @xmath37 ) .    in the following section",

    "namely , the uncertainties in the mass differences @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the two @xmath46  mixing  complexes and in @xmath47 , which quantifies cp violation in @xmath48  mixing , completely dominate over the irrelevantly small experimental errors .",

    "yet the usual small dimension-4 yukawa interactions of the first two generations are sensitive to corrections from dimension-5 terms which are suppressed by @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "these contributions are welcome to fix the unification of the yukawa couplings , but may come with an arbitrary flavour structure , spoiling the predictiveness of the quark - lepton flavour connection .",
