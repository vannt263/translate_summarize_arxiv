    "<S> the modification of the doppler effect due to the coupling of the helicity of the radiation with the rotation of the source / receiver is considered in the case of the pioneer 10/11 spacecraft . </S>",
    "<S> we explain why the pioneer anomaly is not influenced by the helicity - rotation coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 03.30.+p ; 04.20.cv    keywords : pioneer anomaly ; helicity - rotation coupling    the pioneer 10/11 missions were launched about three decades ago and have been the first to explore the outer solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of radio tracking data since about two decades ago  when the effective acceleration away from the sun due to the solar radiation pressure on the spacecraft decreased below @xmath0  has persistently indicated the existence of an anomaly in the doppler navigational data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this pioneer anomaly is a doppler drift that may be interpreted as being due to a small constant acceleration @xmath1 of the spacecraft _ toward _ the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the source of the anomaly is suspected to be a systematic effect associated with the spacecraft ; however , no definitive answer is known as yet @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the modification of the doppler effect due to the coupling of photon spin with the rotation of the emitter / receiver has been elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> this result is of interest for the doppler tracking of spacecraft , since circularly polarized radiation is routinely employed to communicate with spacecraft and , moreover , the earth as well as the spacecraft rotate . </S>",
    "<S> the question then naturally arises whether the helicity - rotation coupling contributes to the pioneer anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> it is the purpose of this letter to explain why there is no such contribution , since the main effect has already been phenomenologically incorporated in the analysis of doppler data .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be the frequency and wave vector of a photon according to inertial observers at rest in a global inertial frame . </S>",
    "<S> the photon is received by a noninertial observer with velocity @xmath4 and rotation frequency @xmath5 such that @xmath6 . according to this rotating observer , the frequency of the photon is @xmath7\\;\\;,\\label{(1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the lorentz factor and @xmath9 is the unit helicity vector of the photon . </S>",
    "<S> the upper ( lower ) sign refers to a positive ( negative ) helicity photon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the photon helicity is related to its intrinsic spin @xmath10 by @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> a beam of positive ( negative ) helicity electromagnetic radiation is such that inertial observers at rest along the beam looking down at the approaching wave will see the electric and magnetic fields both rotate counterclockwise ( clockwise ) with frequency @xmath2 about the direction of propagation . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ ( 1 ) ] ) expresses the standard relativistic doppler effect together with an extra term due to the helicity - rotation coupling @xmath12 that may be neglected for @xmath13 ; otherwise , for a small but nonzero @xmath14 , ignoring helicity - rotation coupling would lead to a systematic doppler shift of magnitude @xmath15 along the beam .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to illustrate the contribution of helicity - rotation coupling to the doppler effect by a simple thought experiment . </S>",
    "<S> imagine an observer rotating uniformly with frequency @xmath16 about the direction of propagation of a plane monochromatic electromagnetic wave of frequency @xmath2 and definite helicity . </S>",
    "<S> looking down at a positive helicity wave , the observer sees the electric and magnetic fields rotate , relative to the observer , with frequency @xmath17 about the propagation direction ; for a negative helicity wave , the relevant frequency would be @xmath18 . taking the time dilation into account for the rotating observer </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath19 in agreement with equation ( [ ( 1 ) ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result has been experimentally verified using the gps system , where the helicity - rotation coupling is known as the `` phase wrap - up '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further observational confirmations in the microwave and optical domains are discussed in @xcite .    in connection with the pioneer doppler drift </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the rotation frequency of the earth @xmath20 is much smaller than that of the pioneer spacecraft , since @xmath21 for pioneer 10 and @xmath22 for pioneer 11 ; therefore , we shall first concentrate on the rotation of the spacecraft , which is essentially about the direction of uplink radio beam from the earth . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath2 be the frequency of the uplink radio beam with a definite helicity . in the case of the pioneer 10/11 spacecraft , @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that a spacecraft rotates with frequency @xmath16 about the uplink direction , the frequency received at the spacecraft is essentially @xmath24 according to equation ( [ ( 1 ) ] ) , where the upper ( lower ) sign refers to positive ( negative ) helicity radio waves . here </S>",
    "<S> we neglect terms of order @xmath25 by setting @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> let us next assume that the spacecraft transmits the same frequency @xmath27 back to the earth  though , in practice , the situation is more complicated @xcite  with the same helicity that was received . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ ( 1 ) ] ) then implies that @xmath28 . combining the two results , we find that the transmitted frequency received at the earth is @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect an anomalous spacecraft speed of @xmath30 , which amounts to a few centimeters per second for the pioneer spacecraft , based on the supposition that the helicity - rotation coupling has been totally neglected in the analysis of doppler data . </S>",
    "<S> that is , there would be a linear phase drift as the phase wraps up , but the derivative of the phase would be constant and hence there would be no anomalous acceleration of the spacecraft .    </S>",
    "<S> let us next consider the rotation of the antenna that is fixed with respect to the earth . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation of the earth would introduce an anomalous spacecraft speed of @xmath31 as well , where @xmath32 is the angle that the earth - spacecraft direction makes with the rotation axis of the earth ( colatitude ) . </S>",
    "<S> this anomalous speed is of order @xmath33 cm / sec and is too small to be significant in the analysis of pioneer data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath32 in general varies with time ; therefore , the spacecraft would experience an anomalous acceleration of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this anomalous acceleration is negligibly small in the case of the pioneer spacecraft and hence does not affect the pioneer anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the explanation of how the main helicity - rotation coupling term has in effect been taken into account in the analysis of doppler data .    </S>",
    "<S> pioneer 10 was launched on 2 march 1972 . in preparation for that launch , the navigation team at jpl </S>",
    "<S> was concerned about two unpredictable effects  the characterization of the acceleration and torques on the spacecraft from solar radiation pressure , and a possible spin bias in the radio doppler data used to determine the spacecraft s earth to jupiter transfer orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty in the solar radiation effect was based on unknown absorptivities and emissivities of spacecraft components and , to a lesser extent , their effective surface areas . </S>",
    "<S> a solar - pressure model solved that problem by providing physical parameters that could be inferred from the doppler tracking data . </S>",
    "<S> for example , shortly after launch the absorptivity and emissivity coefficients determined from the tracking data provided a physically reasonable thermal model for both the front and back sides of the high - gain parabolic antenna ( 2.74 m diameter ) . those parameters , determined for pioneer 10 in 1972 and later pioneer 11 after its launch on 5 april 1973 , were used with confidence for the duration of the pioneer mission , up until termination of tracking in october 1990 for pioneer 11 and march 2002 for pioneer 10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the spacecraft spin on the doppler data was not well understood at launch . </S>",
    "<S> the high - gain antenna that would transmit the radio carrier wave to earth was attached to the spin - stabilized spacecraft , and aligned with the spin axis , hence there was no doubt that the antenna would be spinning at the same rate as the spacecraft , and that the antenna would always be pointing approximately at earth . based on a simple argument that the radio wave s electric vector would be referenced to the rotating antenna , </S>",
    "<S> not inertial space , the navigation team concluded that a constant frequency shift would be introduced into the doppler data , but experts in radio wave propagation at jpl were not so sure . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation theory was complicated by the fact that accurate tracking required a two - way radio link with the spacecraft . </S>",
    "<S> there was no frequency reference on board the spacecraft and it was necessary to do doppler tracking by means of a spacecraft transponder , with both uplink and downlink transmissions referenced to atomic frequency standards at the stations . </S>",
    "<S> it was known that the deep space network ( dsn ) could transmit either left hand or right hand circularly polarized radio waves , and it was also known that at the spacecraft the transmission was right hand circularly polarized from the cross - dipole antenna feed and left hand circularly polarized from the parabolic dish . </S>",
    "<S> but there was no certainty in how this information translated into a possible doppler frequency bias , and indeed more than one communications engineer predicted there would be no spin effect in the two - way doppler data .    </S>",
    "<S> faced with uncertainties about a possible spin bias , the navigation team decided to apply a correction based on the idea that each revolution of the spacecraft adds one cycle of phase to both the uplink and downlink . </S>",
    "<S> the transponder ratio between the uplink frequency at s - band , approximately 2.11 ghz , and the downlink frequency was 240/221 , hence it was decided to add a bias equal to @xmath36 cycles per revolution of the spacecraft , or a frequency bias in hz of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the spacecraft spin period in seconds as measured by spacecraft sensors . however , even given that the bias was appropriate , its sign was unpredictable . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure shortly after launch was to apply the bias to the data , with alternately a positive and negative sign and to see which sign gave a better fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> the positive sign definitely gave a better fit , and further the alternative of no effect was ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the solar pressure constants , this inferred doppler bias was added to the frequency data for the duration of the mission . before 17 july 1990 </S>",
    "<S> it was added to the dsn data delivered to the trajectory analyst . </S>",
    "<S> after that , it was not added to the dsn raw data , and the analyst applied the correction . </S>",
    "<S> the pioneer project at nasa / ames research center provided the jpl analysts , by way of the dsn , with the spin data for both pioneer 10 and pioneer 11 . a bias introduced by the rotation of the dsn antenna in inertial space was never applied to the data . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear if this was an oversight , or if a calculation was made in the early 1970s and it was determined that the dsn bias was buried at a negligible level in the doppler noise . </S>"
