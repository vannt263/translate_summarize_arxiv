    "since the pioneering work of weinberg @xcite , there has been much progress and interest in treating low - energy nuclear physics using the renormalization group ( rg ) and effective field theory ( eft ) approach @xcite .",
    "a central idea here is that physics in the infra red region must be insensitive to the details of the short range ( high momentum ) dynamics . in low - energy nuclear physics , we are probing nuclear systems with low - energy probes of wave length @xmath4 ; such probes can not reveal the short range details at distances much smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , our understanding about the short range dynamics is still preliminary , and model dependent . because of these considerations ,",
    "a central step in the rg - eft approach is to divide the fields into two categories : slow fields and fast fields , separated by a chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath5 1 gev .",
    "then by integrating out the fast fields , one obtains an effective field theory for the slow fields only .",
    "this approach has been very successful in treating low - energy nuclear systems , as discussed in the references cited above .    in order to have an effective interaction appropriate for complex nuclei in which typical nucleon momenta are @xmath6 , we separate fast and slow modes by a scale much smaller than @xmath7 , namely @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to the pion production threshold , a scale often not considered in traditional eft methods , even though it represents the limit of available 2-nucleon data ; experiments give a unique effective interaction only up to this scale .",
    "this cutoff has been employed recently by several authors @xcite in a new development for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction : the derivation of a low momentum nn potential , @xmath0 . despite some general similarities",
    ", we would like to stress that @xmath0 is not a traditional eft construct , and would like to now attempt to clarify this issue .",
    "one drawback to the commonly used rg - eft , which adheres to order - by - order consistency in the power counting , is it s lack of predictability .",
    "the number of unknown parameters increases rapidly as the number of nucleons involved in the process increases .",
    "even if such a method were available for complex nuclei , the parameters would be far from first principle qcd .",
    "the key ingredient in our approach is the highly refined standard nuclear physics approach ( snpa ) and the objective is to marry the snpa to an eft @xcite .    as an illustration of our strategy",
    ", we briefly discuss how this marriage can be effectuated .",
    "as summarized recently @xcite , a thesis now develped for some time posits that by combining the snpa , based on potentials fit to experiments , with modern effective field theory , one can achieve more predictive power than the purist s eft alone .",
    "this combination of snpa and effective field theory , called eft * by kubodera @xcite , but more properly called _ more effective _ effective field theory ( meeft ) as noted by kubodera , was rediscovered in @xcite , and consists of an rg - type approach which limits @xmath9 to 2.1@xmath10 , because this is equal to the center of mass momentum up to which experiments measuring the nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shifts have been carried out .",
    "thus , the `` more effective '' in meeft arises from the guarantee that all experimental data will be reproduced by @xmath0 , which will contain no fourier components higher than those at which experiments have been carried out and analyzed .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 is reliable up to @xmath11 .",
    "this seems to be adequate for a description of shell model properties of complex nuclei .    in practice",
    ", the construction of @xmath0 begins with one of a number of available realistic models @xcite for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential @xmath12 .",
    "while these models agree well in the low momentum ( long range ) region , where they are just given by the one pion exchange interaction , in the high momentum ( short range ) region they are rather uncertain and , in fact , differ significantly from one another .",
    "naturally , it would be desirable to remove these uncertainties and model dependence from the high momentum components of the various modern nn potentials .",
    "following our rg - type approach to achieve this end , it would seem to be appropriate to integrate out the high momentum modes of the various @xmath12 models .",
    "this is how the @xmath0 was derived , and in section ii , we provide a brief outline of the derivation based on t - matrix equivalence .",
    "the low - momentum nn potential , @xmath0 , reproduces the deuteron binding energy , low - energy nn phase shifts and the low - momentum half - on - shell t - matrix .",
    "furthermore , it is a smooth potential and can be used directly in nuclear many body calculations , avoiding the calculation of the brueckner g - matrix @xcite .",
    "shell model nuclear structure calculations using @xmath0 have indeed yielded very encouraging results @xcite .",
    "these calculations apply the same @xmath0 to a wide range of nuclei , including those in the sd - shell , tin region , and heavy nuclei in the lead region . at the present",
    ", no algebraic form exists for @xmath0 , and it should be useful to have one . in the present work we study the feasibility of finding such an expression .",
    "a central result of modern renormalization theory is that a general rg decimation generates an infinite series of counter terms @xcite consistent with the input interaction .",
    "when we derive our low momentum interaction , the high momentum modes of the input interaction are integrated out .",
    "does this decimation also generate a series of counter terms ?",
    "if so , then what are the properties of the counter terms so generated ?",
    "we study these questions in section iii where we carry out an accurate determination of the counter terms and show that this approach reproduces not only @xmath0 , but the deuteron binding energy and low - energy phase shifts as well .",
    "we shall discuss that the counter terms represent generally a short range effective interaction and are important only for partial waves with angular momentum @xmath13 .",
    "the scaling behavior of the counter terms with respect to the decimation momentum will be studied in section iv . finally in section",
    "v , we examine the prospect for using @xmath0 and the counter term method in shell model calculations .",
    "since our method for deriving the low - momentum interaction @xmath0 has been described elsewhere @xcite , in the following we only outline the derivation .",
    "we obtain @xmath0 from a realistic @xmath12 model , such as the cd - bonn model , by integrating out the high - momentum components .",
    "this integration is carried out with the requirement that the deuteron binding energy and low - energy phase shifts of @xmath12 are preserved by @xmath0 .",
    "this preservation may be satisfied by the following t - matrix equivalence approach @xcite .",
    "we start from the half - on - shell t - matrix @xmath14 noting that the intermediate state momentum @xmath15 is integrated from 0 to @xmath16 .",
    "we then define an effective low - momentum t - matrix by @xmath17 where @xmath9 denotes a momentum space cut - off and @xmath18 .",
    "we choose @xmath19 , essentially the momentum up to which the experiments give us information in the phase shift analysis .",
    "note that in eq.(2 ) the intermediate state momentum is integrated from 0 to @xmath9 .",
    "we require the above t - matrices satisfying the condition @xmath20 the above equations define the effective low momentum interaction @xmath0 , and are satisfied by the solution @xcite @xmath21 which is just the kuo - lee - ratcliff folded - diagram effective interaction @xcite . here",
    "@xmath22 represents the irreducible vertex function whose intermediate states are all beyond @xmath9 ; @xmath23 is the same as @xmath22 except with its terms first order in the interaction removed .    for any decimation momentum @xmath9 ,",
    "the above @xmath0 can be calculated highly accurately ( essentially exactly ) using either the andreozzi - lee - suzuki @xcite ( als ) or the krenciglowa - kuo @xcite iteration methods .",
    "these procedures preserve the deuteron binding energy in addition to the half - on - shell t matrix , which implies preservation of the phase shifts . after obtaining the above @xmath0 , which is not hermitian",
    ", we further perform an okubo transformation @xcite to make it hermitian .",
    "this is done using the method given in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we first calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the wave operator obtained with the als method .",
    "then the hermitian @xmath0 is calculated in terms of these quantities in a convenient way ( see eq.(23 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "here we study whether the low - momentum interaction @xmath0 can be well represented by the low - momentum part of the original nn interaction supplemented by certain simple counter terms .",
    "specifically , we consider @xmath26 where @xmath27 is some bare nn potential @xmath12 . since @xmath0 and @xmath27 are both known , there is no question about the existence of @xmath28 in general .",
    "our aim is , however , to investigate if @xmath28 can be well represented by a short ranged effective interaction , such as a smeared out delta function .",
    "we shall check this conjecture by assuming a suitable momentum expansion form for @xmath28 and investigating how well it can satisfy the above equality . since @xmath27 is generally given according to partial waves as is @xmath0 , we shall proceed to determine @xmath28 separately for each partial wave . at very small radial distance",
    ", the bessel function @xmath29 behaves like @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that @xmath28 is a very short ranged interaction .",
    "hence the leading term in a momentum expansion of the partial wave matrix element @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "thus we consider the following expansion for the partial wave counter term potential , namely .1 cm @xmath33 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the counter term coefficients will be determined by standard @xmath34-square fitting procedure so that the difference between @xmath0 and ( @xmath27+@xmath28 ) is minimized .",
    "we note that for @xmath35 and @xmath36 being both s - wave , the leading term for @xmath28 is @xmath37 which is momentum independent and corresponds to a delta interaction . for other channels",
    ", however , the leading term for the counter potential is momentum dependent .",
    "for example , for @xmath35 and @xmath36 being both p - wave , the leading term is @xmath38 .    if we take the projection operator @xmath39 to project onto states with momentum less than @xmath9 , namely @xmath40 , we can rewrite @xmath27 of eq.(5 ) as @xmath41 . from now on we",
    "shall also abbreviate @xmath28 as @xmath42 .",
    "the above counter term approach for @xmath0 is similar to that used in rg - eft @xcite , as both methods impose some cutoff , integrate out the modes above that cutoff , and then attempt to recover the information contained in those states in a counter term series . ultimately , the main difference is the the cutoff scale used and the resulting potential to which @xmath42 is added .",
    "as already noted , in the representation of @xmath0 given above , we use a momentum cutoff above which no constraining data exists , and thus our `` slow '' potential is a bare nn potential projected onto the low momentum states . in the eft scheme ,",
    "the `` slow '' potential is obtained by integrating out heavy dynamical degrees of freedom above the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "hence , counter terms are added to @xmath43 , which is given by light mesons below the cutoff scale , and usually taken to be @xmath44 with unrestricted pion momentum .",
    "we have also tried to fit @xmath0 solely to a low order momentum expansion , and found the results to be less than satisfactory ; the number of terms needed to produce an accurate representation is much higher than the order used here .",
    "attempts at fitting ( @xmath44 + @xmath42 ) also generated results far less satisfactory than fitting it by ( @xmath27+@xmath42 ) .",
    "we shall discuss these points later .",
    "0.5 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now let us examine the counter terms themselves .",
    "in table i , we list some of the counter term coefficients , using cd - bonn as our bare potential .",
    "it is seen that the counter terms are significant only for the s , p and d partial waves .",
    "we do not list results beyond the @xmath45 partial waves , as the coefficients for them are all zero up to the level of our numerical accuracy ( all entries in the table with magnitudes less than @xmath46 have been set to zero ) .",
    "it is of interest that except for the above partial waves , @xmath0 is essentially the same as @xmath41 alone .",
    "this behavior is clearly a reflection that @xmath42 is basically a very short ranged effective interaction . from the table , @xmath37 is clearly the dominant term in the expansion .",
    "coefficients beyond @xmath47 are generally small and can be ignored . in the last row of the table",
    ", we list the rms deviations between @xmath0 and @xmath48 ; the fit is indeed very good .    comparing counter term coefficients for different @xmath27 potentials can illustrate key differences between those potentials .",
    "thus , in table ii , we compare the low order counter terms obtained for the cd - bonn @xcite , nijmegen @xcite , argonne @xcite and paris @xcite nn potentials .",
    "the @xmath37 coefficients for these potentials are significantly different , indicating that one of the chief differences between these potentials is the way in which they treat the short range repulsion . for instance",
    ", the paris potential effectively has a very strong short - range repulsion and consequently its @xmath37 is of much larger magnitude than the others .",
    "our counter term @xmath42 has been determined by requiring a best fit between ( @xmath27+@xmath42 ) and @xmath0 .",
    "we have explored other schemes of fitting : we have tried to determine @xmath42 by requiring a best fit between ( @xmath44+@xmath42 ) and @xmath0 .",
    "but the results are far from satisfactory , the resulting rms deviation at best fit being too large .",
    "it may be of interest to determine @xmath42 by requiring a best fit between @xmath0 and @xmath42 alone .",
    "we have also tried this , with similar unsatisfactory results ( large resulting rms deviation ) .",
    "a possible explanation may be the following .",
    "a main portion of @xmath0 come from @xmath49 and other higher order processes ; it appears that such contributions can not be compensated by the @xmath42 of the simple low - order form of eq.(6 ) .",
    "in fig . 5 we display the scaling behavior of counter terms @xmath37 and @xmath50 with respect to the decimation momentum @xmath9 .",
    "we note that for the @xmath51 channel , @xmath37 and @xmath50 display a weak @xmath9 dependence .",
    "this is a welcome result .",
    "we should note that in meeft , we are obliged to choose @xmath52 , because phase shifts from experiments have been carried out up through this momentum and the _ more effective _ in meeft means that we fit all available experimental data by @xmath0 .",
    "however , the @xmath37 for the @xmath53 channel varies significantly with @xmath9 . in this channel",
    ", there is tensor force which is a mid - range interaction coming from @xmath54 and @xmath55 mesons ; it has large momentum components in the intermediate momentum region of several @xmath10 .",
    "as we lower @xmath9 through this region , we are actually integrating out a predominant portion of the tensor force , in addition to the short range repulsion of @xmath27 . as a result",
    ", we would expect the @xmath37 to change to compensate for this loss of the tensor force .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath37 for @xmath51 comes mainly from integrating out only the short range repulsion , and little variation is seen .",
    "conversely , as @xmath9 increases , the tensor force is largely retained within the cutoff , and the two @xmath37 s come close to each other as seen in the figure . to justify this line of thinking",
    ", we removed the tensor force to see how it would effect the @xmath53 @xmath37 .",
    "we found that the scaling for this term was indeed quite different , displaying a flat behavior over the entire @xmath9 range ; @xmath37 only changed from 0.05 at @xmath56fm to 0.07 at @xmath57fm .",
    "it should be observed that our fig .",
    "5 does not cover the small @xmath9 region .",
    "the reason for this is that we have found that our counter term approach is not applicable to cases with @xmath58 or smaller . in this region , we have not been able to achieve a satisfactory fit between @xmath0 and ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "a likely reason for this is that for small @xmath9 s , we are integrating out a major part of the tensor force , which can not be compensated by the simple low order counter terms as indicated by eq.(6 ) .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the counter terms are all rather small except for the s waves .",
    "this is consistent with the rg - eft approach where the counter term potential is mainly a delta function force @xcite .",
    "when using @xmath60 , we see that the @xmath37 coefficients for the @xmath51 and @xmath53 channels are different .",
    "this suggests that the counter term potential is spin dependent and may be written as @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for the coefficients of table i",
    ", we have @xmath64 fm and @xmath65 fm . as indicated in fig .",
    "5 , this spin - dependent factor @xmath66 will diminish as @xmath9 increases .",
    "in shell model calculations , a basic input is the relative matrix elements @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the oscillator wave functions for the relative motion of the two nucleons and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the two - nucleon spin and isospin . the relative momenta @xmath72 and @xmath70 couple to total angular momentum @xmath73 . from these matrix elements ,",
    "the two - particle shell model matrix elements in the laboratory frame can be calculated @xcite .",
    "thus if @xmath0 and @xmath48 are to prove useful in a broad sense , they must preserve these matrix elements .",

    "to begin , we note that the harmonic oscillator matrix elements for @xmath0 are approximately the same regardless of which of the four bare potentials we use .",
    "so , as far as providing input for shell model calculations , this is further evidence that the @xmath0 is approximately unique .",
    "next , we come to the main result of the table , which is that the matrix elements for @xmath0 and @xmath75 are in very good agreement . we have used the cd bonn for the bare potential , but this holds for the other bare potentials as well .",
    "in fact for the @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 channels , the elements are virtually exact out to four significant figures , and there is only minimal disagreement in the coupled channel .",
    "while there are several models for the nucleon - nucleon potential in use today , they suffer from uncertainty and model dependence .",
    "motivated by rg - eft ideas , a low momentum nn interaction , @xmath0 , has been constructed via integrating out the high momentum , model dependent components of these different potentials .",
    "the result appears to give an approximately unique representation of the low momentum nn potential , and the main issue addressed in this paper was whether @xmath0 could accurately be cast in a form @xmath75 , where @xmath42 is a low order counter term series , and what the physical significance of this counter term series was .",
    "we have shown that this was indeed the case as @xmath0 is nearly identical to @xmath79 over all partial waves , and that @xmath79 reproduces both the deuteron binding energy and the nn phase shifts in the low momentum region .",
    "we have found that only the leading terms in the counter term series have much significance , indicating that the counter term potential is mainly a short range effective interaction which can be accurately represented by a simple low - order momentum expansion .",
    "furthermore , we examined the scaling properties of the s - wave counter terms with respect to @xmath9 and found that the tensor force is responsible for the behavioral differences exhibited between the @xmath53 channel and the @xmath51 channel .",
    "finally , we examined the potential for using @xmath0 and @xmath79 in shell model calculations .",
    "again , it was seen that not only does @xmath0 give approximately identical input matrix elements irrespective of which bare potential was used , but that the counter term approach provided nearly the same results .",
    "thus we have shown that the high momentum information integrated out of each bare nn potential can be accurately replaced by the counter terms , making the use of @xmath0 in a broad context much more tractable ."
