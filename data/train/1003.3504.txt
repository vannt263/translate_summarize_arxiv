    "quantum mechanics hoards intriguing variety of phenomena .",
    "many of which hinges on entanglement .",
    "a striking example is the teleportation @xcite which has no real counterpart in classical physics .",
    "indeed entanglement is at the heart of quantum mechanics .",
    "its fundamental role was already recognized in 1935 by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite and by schredinger @xcite .",
    "schredinger calls it `` the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics '' @xcite .",
    "entanglement , its characterization and properties have been studied ever since ( recent reviews are given , e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "the primitive system where entanglement can be defined , is a bipartite system .",
    "in such a system , it is intuitively clear that entanglement is attained by two particles ( subsystems ) in a pure state with nontrivial schmidt decomposition @xcite . with this understanding in mind",
    ", an immense effort has been undertaken to find a measure for entanglement ( entanglement monotone ) .",
    "in fact for bipartite systems a standard quantification exists . for pure states ,",
    "the von neumann entropy of either of the two parties , dubbed as entanglement entropy , was shown to be a successful measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "in fact , the entanglement entropy can be computed from a basic feature of a state  the two - particle concurrence @xcite . while the concurrence itself is intimately related to the ` impurity ' of the one - particle reduce state ( @xmath4}$ ] ) .",
    "therefore the impurity of the reduce state has also been used as a measure of bipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "we note here that there is a subtle difference between finite and infinite dimensional hibert spaces concerning bipartite pure states . in finite dimensional",
    "hilbert space bipartite pure states range from product states to maximally entangled states .",
    "however in continuous variable systems pure states could lay outside the hilbert space and may be treated as an ideal , limit case of physical states .",
    "for example , the epr is a maximally entangled state which lays outside the hilbert space .",
    "it can be considered as the infinite squeezing limit of a two - mode squeezed state ( tmss ) .",
    "the latter is a physical state and for any finite non - zero value of squeezing is a non - maximally entangled state .    except for this subtle point ,",
    "however , the full range of bipartite entangled states are successfully quantified .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask the following question : is entanglement analytical ?",
    "in other words , suppose we are given a family of states which is parametrized by some physical parameter , if we continuously change this parameter , does the entanglement of the parametrized state change continuously ?",
    "similar questions have been addressed @xcite in the settings of continuous variable systems . there , a peculiar behavior of entanglement , has been noticed , and have been shown to have both theoretical and practical consequences . from theoretical point of view , it was shown @xcite that in any neighborhood of every product state lies an arbitrarily strongly entangled state .",
    "this in turn , for example , implies on ways to retain meaningful measures of entanglement in continuous variable systems .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , in the literature there is only one explicit example @xcite for this kind of peculiar behavior of entanglement in infinite dimensions . in @xcite , a standard nonlinear optics interaction followed by a simple interaction with a beam splitter",
    "was shown to generate an arbitrarily large amount of entanglement in an arbitrarily short time .",
    "this important result has its effect upon the entangling power of unitary operations . here",
    ", we provide another example for such power .",
    "the example is given in terms of a family of tmss .",
    "we first identify a class of tmss which are parametrized by an angular variable @xmath0 and a squeezing parameter @xmath1 , @xmath5 .",
    "actually as we shall see it would be enough to consider the example only for @xmath6 .",
    "the two parameters set up a sequence of states , spreading from product states ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) to maximally entangled states ( @xmath9 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "then we calculate the measure of entanglement of a generic state in the family .",
    "we show that as the parametrized state becomes more squeezed ( @xmath10 ) , an abrupt change in the entanglement happens for certain values of @xmath2 .",
    "the entanglement is nearly a constant ( of the order of @xmath11 ) for every value of @xmath2 , except at the vicinity of @xmath7 where the entanglement rapidly decreases to zero . at @xmath7",
    "the state is an exact product state for every value of @xmath1 .",
    "this change is discontinuous in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the same argument will hold for @xmath12 as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin , in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] with a particular parametrization of one - particle mutual unbiased bases ( mub ) @xcite , which we have considered earlier @xcite .",
    "the parametrization is given in terms of an angular variable @xmath13 .",
    "the bases are constructed by considering infinitely squeezed states , in as much as position and momentum eigenstates are infinitely squeezed unbiased states .",
    "this part sets the stage for constructing , in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , parametrized bipartite maximally entangled states ( again with an angular variable @xmath2 ) which at the end would demonstrate the discontinuous property of entanglement . to get better understanding on how the discontinuity comes about",
    ", we apply our parametrization to two - mode squeezed states .",
    "our study compares the entanglement of two states with close values of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that at the vicinity of @xmath7 there is a rapid change in the entanglement .",
    "this change becomes discontinuous in the limit of maximally entangled states .",
    "this is done in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with final remarks and close with a short discussion on a possible experiment to demonstrate this feature of entanglement .",
    "consider the complete orthonormal basis @xmath14 , @xmath15 , defined by the eigenvalue equation , @xmath16 this defines @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath17 has a clear physical meaning , in quantum optics for example , the ` position ' and ` momentum ' operators ( quadratures ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the in - phase and the out - of - phase components of an electric field amplitude with respect to a strong ( classical ) reference field @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 is a position eigenstate while @xmath23 is a momentum eigenstate .",
    "it is convenient to consider the operators @xcite , @xmath24 such that , @xmath25    now , the state @xmath26 may be expressed in terms of the state at @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) @xcite , @xmath29\\cos \\theta-2yx\\right)}.\\ ] ] two bases ( in our case , two distinct values for @xmath2 ) are said to be mub if and only if the _ magnitude _ of the scalar product of a vector belonging to one basis with one belonging to the other basis is independent of their vectorial ( intra basis ) labels .",
    "we verify that the bases labelled @xmath2 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 , are mub : @xmath32 we now define the state @xmath33 as @xmath34 then , similarly to eqs .",
    "( [ lam],[prels ] ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a momentum eigenstate .",
    "now the well known fourier transform relation implies , @xmath37 we note that , since @xmath38 is an eigenfunction of @xmath19 , with eigenvalue @xmath39 , we have , @xmath40 underscoring that @xmath38 is a momentum eigenstate with an eigenvalue @xmath39 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is also a momentum eigenstate with an eigenvalue @xmath43 , . the @xmath2 labelling of mub suggests its extension to two - particle entangled states .",
    "the generic entangled state in phase space ( i.e. no spin ) is the epr state @xmath44 these operators when combined with @xmath45 form a complete set of operators . by analogy with our analysis above we now consider the complete orthonormal bases @xmath46 defined as , @xmath47 alternatively , we may consider the orthonormal bases @xmath48 defined as , @xmath49 we define the following operators @xmath50 that obey the commutation relations @xmath51=\\left[\\hat{b},\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}\\right]=1,\\ ] ] with all other commutators vanishing .",
    "we define @xmath52 with these definitions , we may write @xmath53 and , @xmath54 it follows that @xmath55",
    "to gain better understanding , and to show how discontinuity comes about , let us first consider a family of tmss which at the limit of infinite squeezing recover the maximally entangled states discussed above .",
    "the wigner representation of a tmss is given by @xcite @xmath56.\\ ] ] this wigner function approaches @xmath57 in the limit of infinite squeezing @xmath3 , corresponding to the original ( perfectly correlated i.e. maximally entangled , but unphysical ) epr state ( [ epr ] ) .",

    "= .50    indeed , in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , we plot @xmath59 as a function of @xmath70 for different @xmath1 values .",

    "this can also be seen directly by calculating the @xmath96 representation of the state and noting that it is of the same form as the epr state , i.e. its schmidt decomposition contains all the states paired with coefficients of equal magnitude @xcite : @xmath97 this is a maximally entangled state for @xmath98 while a product state for @xmath83 ( c.f . , eq  .([product ] ) ) .",
    "we interpret this to mean that entanglement is discontinuous .",
    "single particle mutual unbiased bases labelled by an angle @xmath2 was considered .",
    "this labelling was then used to define a set of two - particle states which we called @xmath2-parametrized tmss . within this set",
    ", we identified a class of states which are almost maximally entangled for @xmath99 and product states for @xmath83 .",
    "this unique class of states may be used to study the power of entangling operation in phase space and has a direct manifestation in ( nonlinear ) quantum optics .",
    "one could use , for example , bell s inequality for continuous variable systems to demonstrate this feature .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite how to construct an optimal bell s inequality for continuous variable gaussian states such as the @xmath2-parametrized tmss . then , using the experimental scheme proposed in @xcite one could test the violation of the suitable constructed bell s inequality by the @xmath2-parametrized tmss . in this proposed scheme the @xmath2-parametrized tmss",
    "is realized by a correlated state of light , where the correlation refers to two spatially separated modes of the electromagnetic field , and @xmath2 is related to a phase of a classical reference field .",
    "next , a photon counting experiment will lead directly to a measurement that is described by the wigner function .",
    "indeed , it was shown @xcite that these functions are given by joint photon count correlations and as such can be used to test local realism in the form of bell s inequalities .",
    "we expect that at the for @xmath9 and for large squeezing @xmath1 the violation will be almost maximal , i.e. close to @xmath100 , while at the vicinity of @xmath7 there will be a rapid decrease in the violation .",
