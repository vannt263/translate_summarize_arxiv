    "the movement of a light - emitting object relative to an observer causes relativistic beaming of the light ( aka doppler boosting ) since the specific intensity is not a relativistic invariant . when the object s radial velocity ( rv ) is periodically modulated , as is the case in binary systems , a periodic sinusoidal variation in the observed flux is induced .",
    "this effect is one of three that can be seen in light curves  of binary systems , not necessarily eclipsing .",
    "the other two are the ellipsoidal effect , when a member of the binary system is tidally affected by the gravitational pull of its companion , and the reflection effect , when light originating from one component is reflected by the other .",
    "the three effects were discussed in the context of planet - host stars by @xcite , and main sequence stellar binaries by @xcite . both studies addressed binary systems with orbital periods much longer than a day , finding that the required photometric accuracy necessitates space - based observations .",
    "observational detections of the beaming effect are rare .",
    "@xcite noted that the beaming effect is likely to be seen in their ground - based data of a sdb star + wd binary system with a period of @xmath2=2.28 hr , although the effect s amplitude was not measured and the light curve  is dominated by the ellipsoidal effect .",
    "@xcite measured the beaming and ellipsoidal effects in a _",
    "kepler _ light curve  of an a - type star + low - mass wd binary system with @xmath2=5.19 d @xcite , and",
    "in fact used these measurements to resolve the puzzling nature of the system ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite identified the beaming and ellipsoidal effects in _ corot _ data of a brown dwarf host star ( corot-3 ; @xmath2=4.26 d ) , and @xcite observed all three effects with _ kepler _ in a 9.69 hr sdb + wd binary .",
    "we show here that for high mass ratio detached , non - interacting double white dwarf ( wd ) binaries the relative beaming amplitude is above the 10@xmath3 level , while the ellipsoidal and reflection amplitudes are smaller by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "therefore , these systems represent an excellent opportunity to measure the beaming effect using ground - based telescopes .    following the discovery of the first eclipsing detached double wd binary nltt  11748  by @xcite we immediately noticed it is an excellent candidate for ground - based observations of the beaming effect .",
    "the observed rv amplitude is large ( @xmath4270 km s@xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the secondary is @xmath430 times fainter than the primary @xcite .",
    "in addition , the orbital period is short enough to be covered within a single night .",
    "nltt  11748  and similar systems where both the ( photometric ) beaming amplitude and the ( spectroscopic ) rv amplitude can be measured are a valuable tool for testing the relation between these two quantities , which is currently approximated using theoretical assumptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss the beaming effect in non - interacting double wd systems in .",
    "our observations and data analysis are described in .",
    "we present the results in where we also test them and compare our findings to theoretical expectations . in",
    "we summarize our results and give our conclusions .",
    "the relatively large beaming amplitude in non - interacting double wd binaries originates from the unique wd mass - radius , or mass - luminosity relation . in those binary systems",
    "the photometric primary ( hereafter , the primary ) is a helium core wd , a few times smaller in mass but larger in radius and luminosity than the photometric secondary ( hereafter , the secondary ) , a c / o core wd ( see also table 1 in @xcite ) . as shown by @xcite the observed beaming effect is the weighted difference between the individual beaming effects of the two binary components , shifted by a phase of 0.5 .",
    "however , the larger mass and smaller luminosity of the c / o wd make its own beaming effect much smaller , and even negligible relative to that of the he wd .",
    "this can be seen by assuming both stars radiate as blackbodies and rewriting equation  ( 6 ) of @xcite as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radial velocity amplitude of the primary , @xmath8 the speed of light , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the mass of the primary ( secondary ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the flux from the primary ( secondary ) .",
    "@xmath13 relates to the spectral index @xmath14 as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the effective temperature of the primary ( secondary ) .    for a high mass ratio non - interacting double wd binary the term @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beamamp1 ] ) right hand side becomes of order unity .",
    "this follows from the mass ratio and the flux ratio of the two stars , and also from the fact that @xmath20 is itself close to unity for the expected effective temperatures of the two stars . therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : beamamp1 ] ) reduces to : @xmath21 or in physical parameters : @xmath22 where @xmath23 the orbital inclination angle .",
    "the approximation neglects the contribution of the secondary and assumes a blackbody spectrum and a circular orbit .",
    "since @xmath24 has a value of a few in the optical for the typical temperatures of he wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the equation above shows that the beaming amplitude is expected to be at the few 10@xmath3 level , and therefore detectable from the ground .",
    "we note that this is not the accuracy required from a single measurement but the overall relative sinusoidal variability amplitude along the entire orbit .",
    "[ fig : beamamp2 ] shows the expected sdss-@xmath0 beaming amplitude versus orbital period , for nltt  11748-like systems ( solid line ) .",
    "also plotted ( dashed line ) is the expected amplitude for a system with an inclination angle of @xmath25 degrees .",
    "the figure shows that systems similar to nltt  11748 , but with longer periods and/or lower inclinations are also expected to show a beaming amplitude above the 10@xmath3 level .",
    "we observed nltt  11748  for 3.54.0 hr during each of the three nights of 2010 february 7 , 9 & 12 ut , obtaining data over all orbital phases .",
    "most orbital phases were observed during two different nights .",
    "our observations were done at the lcogt 2.0 m faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) , located at the haleakala observatory , hawaii .",
    "we used the spectral instruments 600 series camera and the sdss-@xmath0 filter .",
    "the camera has a 4k @xmath26 4k back - illuminated fairchild imaging ccd with a @xmath27 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "we used the default @xmath28 pixel binning mode , with an effective pixel scale of @xmath29 .",
    "the telescope pointing was adjusted to have the guiding camera fov include a suitable guide star .",
    "our observations were done while defocusing the telescope , spreading the stellar psf over more pixels and increasing the overall open shutter time relative to the camera dead time , mostly ccd readout time .",
    "the exposure time was 120 s , resulting in a median cycle time of 143 s.    data taken during each night was processed the same way .",
    "preliminary reduction , including bias and flat - field corrections was done using standard iraf routines .",
    "we applied aperture photometry using iraf / phot by using a few aperture sizes and eventually choosing a radius of 10 pixels ( @xmath30 ) , resulting in the smallest scatter in the final light curves  of the target and similar brightness stars , within 1 mag from that of the target .",
    "the target s light curve  was calibrated by dividing it by a comparison light curve   a weighted average light curve  of four comparison stars showing no variability , whether inter- or intra - night .",
    "this calibration included propagation of the errors of both the target and comparison light curves .    out of the total of 286 exposures",
    "seven were taken completely or partially during the 3 min eclipses @xcite , and were ignored in our analysis .",
    "two additional clear outliers in the target s light curve  were visually verified to result from a cosmic ray hitting within the photometric aperture .",
    "therefore , a total of 277 exposures were used in our analysis .",
    "the error estimates of the calibrated light curve  were directly based on the results of iraf / phot .",
    "we rescaled these errors to better reflect the true noise in the data , by fitting a 3rd degree polynomial to the flux ratio light curves  of each night , and inflating the error bars to make the reduced @xmath31 equal one .",
    "the derived scaling factors were 1.83 , 1.37 & 1.53 for the three nights , feb .  7 , 9 & 12 , respectively .",
    "we note that this polynomial fit was done only for the purpose of rescaling the error bars .",
    "the target s airmass varied from @xmath41 to @xmath42 during our observations , which is expected to affect the resulting light curve , depending on the difference in color between the target and comparison light curves .",
    "we removed these trends by taking the data from all three nights together and fitting a 2nd degree polynomial to the target s relative flux versus airmass , and dividing by the fit .",
    "this step resulted in the final light curve , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcnight ] .    in order to look for the beaming effect in the final light curve  we simultaneously fitted for the three known effects ( beaming , reflection and ellipsoidal ) . in our modeling",
    "we took the beaming effect to be a _ sine _",
    "modulation at the orbital period .",
    "the reflection effect has the same period but is lagging in phase by @xmath32 , hence it is a _ cosine _",
    "modulation at the orbital period .",
    "the ellipsoidal effect has half the orbital period but the same phase as the reflection effect , so it is a cosine modulation at the first harmonic of the period .",
    "we used the ephemeris of @xcite and fitted the phase folded light curve  with a 5-parameter model @xcite , including a sine and cosine terms for the orbital period and its first harmonic : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , time subtracted the mid primary eclipse time .",
    "the ephemeris of @xcite is based on observations done during 1.5 months prior to the observations presented here .",
    "this resulted in a negligible uncertainty in the phase during our observations , smaller than 20 seconds , or 10@xmath3 of the period , justifying keeping the phase fixed in our fit .",
    "results for the fitted coefficients are listed in the middle column of .",
    "the fitted beaming relative amplitude is @xmath35 , showing that the beaming signal is detected with a significance of @xmath36 .",
    "the other three fitted coefficients were found to be consistent with zero .",
    "the @xmath31 statistics of the fitted model was 283.9 , and the reduced @xmath31 was @xmath37 for the 272 degrees of freedom , indicating a good estimate of the errors . fig .",
    "[ fig : lccomb ] presents the phase folded light curve  and the fitted model is overplotted .",
    "we have tested our results in order to verify they are not a statistical fluctuation , and that the beaming signal was not accidently injected into the data by our analysis .    assuming the light curve  is non - variable ( equivalent to fitting a constant value equal to the weighted average ) results in @xmath38 for 276 degrees of freedom , and @xmath39 , clearly rejecting the no variability hypothesis . a bootstrap analysis , done by randomly permuting the light curve  points in time showed that the probability of the measured beaming signal being a random one is smaller than 10@xmath40 .",
    "both these tests show , in addition to the amplitude s high s / n , that the detected variability has a high statistical significance",
    ".    it could be that the way we accounted for the airmass induced variation has injected the sine signal into the data .",
    "we tested this in two ways .",
    "first , we changed the polynomial degree used in fitting the relative flux versus airmass . using a degree of 1 gave a 0.5@xmath41 increase in the fitted beaming amplitude and increasing the polynomial degree up to 6 decreased the amplitude by @xmath42 .",
    "in all these fits the other three fitted amplitudes were found to be consistent with zero .",
    "second , we examined the light curves  of similar color stars in the field , with a @xmath43 term within 0.1 mag from that of nltt  11748 . for those stars",
    "@xmath44 was similar at the 0.01 level to that of a non - variable model , indicating they show no significant variability , and that the way we accounted for the airmass variation during our observations did not induce the detected variability .",
    "another possibility is that the detected signal originated from a variability in one of the four comparison stars .",
    "we checked this in two ways .",
    "first , we repeated our analysis four times while excluding one of the four comparison stars , using only the other three .",
    "this changed the fitted coefficients by less than 1@xmath41 and resulted in similar @xmath31 values .",
    "second , we applied the same analysis for each comparison star , using only the other three as comparisons .",
    "as in the case of the similar color stars described above , for all four comparison stars this resulted in a similar @xmath31 when fitting the 5-parameter model and a non - variable model , and the fitted beaming amplitude was consistent with zero .",
    "these two tests show that the variability identified in the target did not originate from the comparison stars .",
    "we repeated our analysis three times using data from only two of the three nights .",
    "we were able to detect the beaming amplitude in each of the three analyzes , although with a lower significance , but still higher than 4@xmath41 . in each of those three",
    "analyzes the other three coefficients were found to be consistent with zero .    finally , we fitted the data also with a simpler , 2-parameter model , including a zero point and only the sine component corresponding to the beaming amplitude ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the result was the same as in the original 5-parameter model , and is listed on the second column from the right in .      for estimating the expected amplitude of the beaming effect in our data we first calculated it as a function of wavelength assuming a blackbody spectrum , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : beamamp2 ] ) .",
    "this function is plotted as a solid black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamamp ] .",
    "we then weighted it by the sdss-@xmath0 filter transmission curve and the ccd qe . the final estimates for each band are marked as filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamamp ] where the error bars due to the uncertainties in @xmath17 and @xmath7 are comparable to the size of the markers . fig .",
    "[ fig : beamamp ] also justifies our choice to observe in sdss-@xmath0 , as the beaming amplitude increases towards the blue , but observations in sdss-@xmath46 are difficult at ftn .",
    "the expected sdss-@xmath0 amplitude is ( @xmath47 , which is within 1@xmath41 from the measured amplitude of ( @xmath48 , marked by a diamond in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamamp ] .",
    "therefore , the measured amplitude for the beaming effect is consistent with the expected value assuming a blackbody spectrum .",
    "another way to estimate the expected beaming amplitude , in a more direct manner and without the need to assume a blackbody spectrum is to integrate over a measured spectrum of the system using eq .  2 of @xcite .",
    "for that end we used the ntt / efosc2 spectrum obtained by @xcite , which covers the sdss-@xmath0 band .",
    "this resulted in an expected amplitude of @xmath49 , less than 2@xmath41 away from the measured amplitude .",
    "however , we caution that the uncertainty on this result is difficult to estimate .",
    "this low resolution spectrum was derived from two 20 min exposures , and was affected by the doppler shift variation during the exposure , and by the rv difference between the two exposures , which could have been at the @xmath5050 km s@xmath5 level , depending on the exact orbital phases they were taken at .",
    "we estimate the amplitude of the ellipsoidal effect following @xcite to be about @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the orbital semi - major axis , @xmath53 the radius of the primary , and we have ignored an order to unity coefficient ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this expression is @xmath54 for nltt  11748 .",
    "although it is only a rough estimate and a more accurate one can be derived for this system , we use it only to show that the ellipsoidal effect is too small to be detected in our data . for the reflection effect we use @xmath55 as an upper limit , which is @xmath56 for nltt  11748 .",
    "therefore , both the ellipsoidal and reflection effects are not expected to be detected from the ground , in agreement with our results .",
    "we have presented a ground - based measurement , carried out with a 2.0 m telescope , of the relativistic beaming effect in the high mass ratio wd binary nltt  11748  @xcite .",
    "we showed that the measured amplitude , of @xmath1 , is within 1@xmath41 from an approximated theoretical estimate , and within 2@xmath41 from a more direct estimate using a low resolution spectrum of the system .",
    "the ellipsoidal and reflection effects were not detected in our data , in agreement with theoretical expectations . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first ground - based measurement of the relativistic beaming effect .",
    "our measurement is a first step in testing the relation between the beaming and rv amplitudes in systems similar to nltt  11748 , and it suggests it can be approximated by assuming a blackbody spectrum . although we were not able to obtain a high precision measurement of the beaming amplitude , it is identified at a high significance , of more than 7@xmath41 .",
    "although short period detached he + c / o wd binaries are rare , their discovery rate is increasing .",
    "five such systems were recently discovered @xcite by rv monitoring , and are expected to show beaming amplitudes of @xmath57 in the optical .",
    "all five have orbital periods of only a few hours , shorter than that of nltt  11748 , so they can be used to further test the relation between the rv amplitude and the beaming amplitude , and also the wavelength dependency of the latter , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamamp ] for nltt  11748 .",
    "the evolution of a low - mass he wd requires it to have a binary companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , once a he wd is identified the beaming effect can be used to look for a binary companion photometrically , in a very similar way to spectroscopic monitoring . since in this case",
    "the light curve  becomes analogous to the rv curve , high precision photometry can in principle be used to model the orbit and measure the mass ratio of the two components .",
