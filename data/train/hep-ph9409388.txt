    "the beautiful results of the lep1 experiments have shown that the electroweak theory has a predictive power like that of qed several decades ago .",
    "it is to be expected that eventually the electroweak theory will provide high precision predictions for many experiments in the present and near future .",
    "one may in particular think in this respect of the measurement of the z mass and width , a better determination of the w mass and a first indication of the value of the top mass .",
    "this will in the future require two - loop calculations in the electroweak theory .",
    "one then has to face several problems : amongst others , a large number of diagrams and many different non - negligible masses .",
    "it is known that analytical results for arbitrary non - vanishing masses are in general not obtainable for two - loop diagrams in the form of generalized polylogarithms .",
    "the present paper contributes to the knowledge about this problem by introducing and applying new analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "a number of new results will be presented .",
    "we focus on the simplest class of two - loop diagrams , i.e. the set of scalar two - loop self - energies .",
    "they are essential for physical predictions and moreover they show the typical problems one encounters in the evaluation of two - loop diagrams .",
    "there exist four non - trivial self - energy diagrams    ( 450,80 ) ( -50,-490 )    ( 60,-12)@xmath0 ( 165,-12)@xmath1 ( 270,-12)@xmath2 ( 372,-12)@xmath3 ( 60,3)@xmath4 ( 60,20)@xmath5 ( 60,40)@xmath6 ( 165,3)@xmath5 ( 150,32)@xmath6 ( 180,32)@xmath7 ( 168,13)@xmath4 ( 270,40)@xmath7 ( 270,27)@xmath4 ( 270,3)@xmath5 ( 248,23)1 ( 290,23)1 ( 370,15)@xmath4 ( 360,32)@xmath6 ( 390,32)@xmath7 ( 360,-4)@xmath5 ( 390,-4)@xmath8    in order to classify our conventions we give the explicit form of the so - called master diagram : @xmath9 where each bracket denotes a @xmath10 dimensional integration over one loop momentum @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary mass . the momenta of the propagators @xmath14 are determined by momentum conservation in terms of the external momentum @xmath15 and the integration momenta @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it can be immediately seen that the diagram @xmath18 can be reduced to a difference of two @xmath1 diagrams by partial fractioning of the propagators with the same momentum : @xmath19 in the special case @xmath20 this has to be taken as a derivative with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "so we are only left with three diagrams to be discussed . of these the master diagram is convergent in four dimensions , the other two are divergent . after evaluating them in @xmath22 dimensions",
    ", one would like to derive an expansion in @xmath23 which starts in @xmath24 and @xmath25 terms .    in recent years",
    "several groups derived small and large @xmath26 expansions for these diagrams .",
    "for the general massive case they obtained algorithms for symbolic evaluation of these expansion coefficients .",
    "for the general coefficients in these expansions , no closed expression was derived .",
    "more recently multiple series were found for which the general coefficient is known and which lead to generalized hypergeometric functions in several variables .",
    "one aim of this paper is to extend these results , an other to express the imaginary parts by elliptic integrals . on the other hand",
    "an elegant numerical method has been worked out leading to a two - dimensional integral representation @xcite .",
    "the second aim of our paper is to improve on this by introducing a one - dimensional integral representation containing only elementary functions . for this a general procedure for diagrams containing one - loop self - energy expressions in a subloop",

    "the actual outline of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "2 the analytic approach leading to generalized hypergeometric functions and the corresponding explicit series representations are given , the elliptic integrals for the diagrams are calculated in sect .",
    "3 . the next sect . describes the numerical approach by means of a one - dimensional representation which is derived by a self - energy insertion into one - loop diagrams .",
    "finally sect .",
    "5 presents some numerical comparisons and draws conclusions .",
    "in this section we present analytic results in an arbitrary number of dimensions @xmath10 for the two - loop scalar self - energy diagrams",
    ". they will be in the form of generalized hypergeometric functions , that is multiple series of ratios of @xmath26 and the masses .",
    "we also discuss the expansion of these results around @xmath27 .    the simplest case of a two - loop scalar self - energy diagram @xmath28 was discussed in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "in fact , the result turned out to be represented by lauricella functions which could be derived by @xmath29-space techniques or mellin - barnes representation for a massive propagator .",
    "it turns out that there is a third method using dispersion relations .",
    "since the latter method will be used several times in this paper we shall first rederive the result for @xmath30 by means of dispersion relations .",
    "then we focus our attention on the two - loop scalar self - energy diagram with four propagators @xmath31 where the small @xmath26 behavior can again be derived by the dispersion method and the large @xmath26 behavior by the mellin - barnes representation method .",
    "although we have three methods , the master diagram still poses many problems , the origin of which we will briefly discuss in the last section .",

    "the above result is valid for small @xmath26 but it can be analytically continued to the large @xmath26 region , using known analytic continuation formulae for the lauricella function @xmath51 . with the dispersion method described above we derive the _ small _ @xmath26 _ result _ for @xmath1 in @xmath10 dimensions .",

    "they have not been studied in the mathematical literature .",
    "one can however obtain information on the convergence region .",
    "the series in @xmath71 can be written as @xmath41 functions which can be transformed into @xmath41 functions with variable @xmath72 .",

    "the following combination of the general massive case with a massless case is chosen in such a way that the infinite parts cancel @xcite @xmath76    an analytic form of this combination is obtained by expanding the multiple series and their coefficients in @xmath23 , where the first and the second logarithmic derivatives of the @xmath77-function occur at integer arguments @xmath78 with the euler constant @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "the analysis of @xcite one can easily find the first term of each of the contributing series .",
    "for the subgraph representing the whole diagram the first term in the series should be the massless diagram .",
    "this series then corresponds to the first term in ( [ large ] ) , i.e. @xmath101 .",
    "the series which originates from the subgraph where two lines have been removed , e.g. 2 and 3 , starts with the product of two massive tadpoles .",
    "they contribute a factor @xmath102 which can be identified with the sixth term in ( [ large ] ) .",
    "the remaining subgraphs are obtained by removing one internal line , e.g. line 3 .",
    "this yields a series starting with a massive tadpole proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "this is the third term in ( [ large ] ) .",
    "the last term in ( [ large ] ) corresponds to the diagram where three internal lines are removed whose reduced graph is the vacuum diagram .",
    "thus the seven series in ( [ large ] ) can be related directly to the seven subgraphs which are required for the method of @xcite .",
