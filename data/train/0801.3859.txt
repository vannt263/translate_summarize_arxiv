    "recently there has been renewed interest in the higher order effects associated with gravitational lensing by black holes in both the weak and strong field limits .",
    "the motivations for such studies arise from both observational and theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "firstly , advances in the ability to perform high precision measurements and observations are at the point where higher order effects are close to being measurable . secondly , many alternative gravity theories ( e.g.  those with higher dimensions , higher derivatives or higher powers of curvature ) differ from general relativity at second - order and beyond . in those cases ,",
    "the differences between the theories need to be understood in order to guide what observations are to be made by experimental relativity practitioners .    within general relativity itself",
    "the properties of charge and rotation associated with black holes only appear as higher order corrections to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "therefore in order to determine what measurable effects such properties might have requires an analysis that goes beyond simply utilising first order computations in a perturbative analysis .",
    "the possibility that a black hole may be able to hold some non - zero electric charge has been raised by a number of authors @xcite . in general relativity",
    "the charge appears at second order in the vacuum reissner - nordstrm solution and therefore higher order computations are required in order to explore the differences between this and the uncharged schwarzschild solution .",
    "charged black holes may well be the end point of the evolution of massive , highly magnetized stars where the neutralization of charge is avoided through some mechanism of selective accretion @xcite .",
    "isolated black holes may then be capable of remaining charged for some time and may therefore be detectable through their influence on the passage of light rays in the space surrounding them . alternatively the reissner - nordstrm spacetime can act as an approximation to the gravitational field of a slowly rotating neutron star or other compact astrophysical object that has been able to maintain a residual surface charge . since the reissner - nordstrm solution is the unique spherically symmetric electrovac solution in four spacetime dimensions , any gravitational lensing effects that arise due to the presence of electrostatic charge from other considerations should be compared against what one would expect in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "however black holes ( both charged and uncharged ) appear in higher dimensional theories of gravity as well",
    ". if spacetime is truly higher dimensional then black hole solutions in those higher dimensions may make themselves known through the differences in the expected physical behaviour of test particles in four dimensions .",
    "the question one might ask is whether it is possible to make observations capable of measuring the differences between black holes in four space time dimensions and those that might exist in higher dimensions . for charged black holes in four - dimensions , these objects will have electromagnetic fields where the source of those fields are due to the existence of non - zero charges .",
    "however higher dimensional black holes can have electromagnetic fields arising from the purely geometric structure of the higher dimensions in the sense of the original kaluza - klein theory .    in order to understand the physics that might arise as a result of gravitational collapse in higher dimensions we undertake a study of the gravitational lensing of photons passing by charged black holes that are obtained as electro - vacuum solutions in four dimensional einstein theory and five - dimensional ( classical ) kaluza - klein theory .",
    "that is we compare the gravitational lensing occurring in the vicinity of a reissner - nordstrm black hole to that which occurs due to a class of charged black hole solutions in kaluza - klein theory that have been discussed by liu and wesson @xcite .",
    "these higher dimensional black holes can exist also without charge .",
    "however in that case the projection onto a four - dimensional spacetime of the uncharged solution is equivalent to the 4-dimensional schwarzschild solution and no difference in gravitational light ray bending would be measured . in the uncharged case",
    "the fifth dimension is flat and will have no influence on the geodesic motion of test particles . therefore in order to determine whether or not the higher dimensional case might exist ,",
    "it is necessary that the black holes be capable of acting as a source of electric field and this will produce differences between the four and five - dimensional black holes solutions . since the fifth dimension is now non - flat it can be expected to have an influence on the motion of photons in four dimensions .",
    "this should lead to differences in the light deflection angle and the `` shapiro time delay '' suffered by photons passing by the black holes .",
    "it has already been shown by sereno @xcite that the deflection angle of a reissner - nordstrm black hole is less than that for a schwarzschild black hole with the same mass .",
    "that is the effect of the charge is to decrease the deflection angle .",
    "this would result in lensed images that appear closer to the position of the lens and to each other .",
    "a gravitational lensing observation alone is insufficient to determine both the charge and the dimensionality of the black hole .",
    "however should the black hole have an accretion disk of ionized material surrounding it , one can in principle determine the charge from the lorentz force law .",
    "the electric fields associated with the 4d and 5d charged black holes that are considered here can be expected to take on their flat space coulombic configuration at large distances and therefore the charge could be determined independently of the spacetime dimensions .",
    "a number of spherically symmetric solutions to the 5d kaluza - klein equations are known . among the vacuum solutions many lack event horizons and",
    "therefore can not be considered as describing black hole solutions .",
    "alternatively , solutions with event horizons can be created by assuming a form of the metric that mimics the schwarzschild solution but then these require a non - zero effective energy momentum tensor on the right - hand - side of the field equations .",
    "indeed a number of authors @xcite have studied gravitational lensing of braneworld black holes where string tension is responsible for the formation of such objects . however , in what follows we will concentrate on a particular class of solutions that have event horizons and are solutions to the 5d vacuum field equations . in the appropriate limit",
    "such solutions reduce to the standard 4d schwarzschild solution .",
    "some of the properties of these solutions have been discussed previously by liu and wesson @xcite who referred to these objects as 5d charged black holes .",
    "using coordinates @xmath0 = @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents a spatial coordinate in the fifth dimension together with the standard spherical polar ( schwarzschild or curvature ) coordinates , the line element for the charged black holes can be written in the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are `` potentials '' that can be obtained by solving the five - dimensional , spherically symmetric , vacuum einstein equations . as explicit functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath7 , the potentials are also dependent upon two arbitrary parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "they may be written in the form ( with @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 of these potentials it can be shown that the potential @xmath12 is the solution to the kaluza - klein equations that are equivalent to the maxwell equations and this leads to a static radial electric field component which contributes to a faraday tensor @xmath13 with a single non - zero component : @xmath14 using the expression for @xmath15 and @xmath12 and the condition that as @xmath16 the electrostatic potential must agree with the coulomb potential one has : @xmath17 this in turn allows for the determination of the parameter @xmath8 ; @xmath18    therefore in terms of the charge @xmath19 and the mass @xmath9 of the black hole , the contributions to the metric coefficients are : @xmath20 and the electric field becomes : @xmath21 the projection of this metric onto the 4d subspace differs from the standard reissner - nordstrm solution even in the limit of large @xmath7 since the 4d line element of the kaluza - klein solution has the approximate form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the 2-metric on the surface of the unit sphere . in practice ,",
    "the electrostatic energy density will be small ( @xmath24 ) and the differences between the charged and uncharged black hole solutions can be expected to be minor .",
    "when @xmath19 vanishes it is easy to see that the solution reduces to the 5d schwarzschild vacuum solution which is just the 4d schwarzschild solution with a flat fifth dimension .",
    "since the contribution from the charge for the reissner - nordstrm spacetime introduces `` second - order '' terms in the metric , the standard gravitational lensing and time delay formulae must be extended to second order so as to include terms of the form @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 etc .  where @xmath28 is a length scale that is of the same order as @xmath9 .",
    "one can derive these either by expanding the integrand that appears upon integrating the first order differential equation form for the geodesic equations or by expanding the differential equations themselves and solving these equations order by order .",
    "the former technique was employed by @xcite , but we take the latter approach here in order to verify the results obtained in those references . here",
    "it must mentioned that the higher order results may be coordinate dependent since the deflection angle calculations are often computed with respect to the distance of closest approach of the photon to the lens . to first order the distance of closest approach and the impact parameter are equivalent .",
    "however at second order , they differ and the differences are coordinate dependent due to the fact that unlike the impact parameter ( which can be written in terms of the constants of the motion and is therefore an invariant ) the definition of the radius of closest approach will depend upon how one defines the radial coordinate .    in this section the standard method of deriving a set of equations governing the motion of test particles is used where we obtain a general second order differential equation for the inverse radial distance @xmath29 from the black hole as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath30 . for the motion of null particles",
    "these equations has been derived by bodenner and will @xcite for a schwarzschild black hole using schwarzschild , isotropic and harmonic radial coordinates .",
    "we follow this method to derive the light bending angles associated with the reissner - nordstrm , and kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "one begins by recognizing that a general four dimensional , static , spherically symmetric line element can be written as @xmath31 the equations of motion can be obtained either by varying the lagrangian for the motion of zero - mass particles or directly from the null geodesic equations . to simplify the calculations ,",
    "the variation in the polar angle can be set to zero since we are dealing with spherical symmetry and motion in the plane defined by @xmath32 .",
    "the equations of motion for this case are @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the constants of the motion associated with the energy and angular momentum of the photon , @xmath36 is an affine parameter along the geodesic , and a prime represents a derivative with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "substituting equations ( [ equation : tee ] ) and ( [ equation : phi ] ) into ( [ equation : are ] ) , making the substitution @xmath37 and re - writing the equation such that @xmath30 is the independent variable , we obtain a second order differential equation for the inverse radial distance from the black hole @xmath38 , @xmath39 one now introduces the impact parameter @xmath40 . once the metric coefficients are specified explicitly , equation  ( [ equation : ugen ] ) can be solved by successive approximations to find the angle of deflection .",
    "while the form of the metric for both the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions allows one to use the form ( 9 ) and the geodesic equation ( 13 ) , it will be seen that the 5d metric ( 1 ) also leads to the same equations of motion ( 13 ) for photons which will allow us to use the same method of solution for all three spacetimes .      in schwarzschild",
    "coordinates the metric coefficients are @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this will leave equation  ( [ equation : ugen ] ) as @xmath43 assuming the solution is expandable in the form @xmath44 will enable us to approximate the solution to arbitrary order in @xmath45 .",
    "the solution to the homogeneous ( zeroth order ) equation is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is equal to the inverse of the impact parameter ( @xmath48 ) which at this order is equal to the inverse of the distance of closest approach .",
    "if we now set @xmath49 , equation  ( [ equation : uss ] ) can be written as    @xmath50    so that the equations up to second order in @xmath45 become    @xmath51    solving these leaves us with the following expression for the inverse radial distance from the black hole ,    @xmath52 + \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\mbox{\\hspace{18pt } } \\left.\\frac{3}{16}m^2u_n^2[20\\phi\\sin\\phi + \\cos(3\\phi)]\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when the light ray originates at a distant source located at @xmath53 and terminates at a distant observer located at @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 or equivalently @xmath56 the deviation from straight line motion is going to be very small .",
    "the deflection angle can be found by solving for @xmath57 , using the source and observer angles @xmath58 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : defl ] ) . since @xmath59",
    ", the trigonometric functions can be expanded in powers of @xmath57 .",
    "the trajectory is symmetric about @xmath60 , so that the total deviation from straight line motion is the angle @xmath61 .",
    "the expression for the deviation angle to second order in @xmath62 can then be found to be : @xmath63 however the bending angle is often written in terms of the distance of closest approach @xmath28 which is the value of @xmath7 when @xmath64 .",
    "this leads to the relation : @xmath65 the approximation of the deflection angle up to second order @xmath66 now becomes : @xmath67 it must be remembered that the second order terms in this latter expression is valid only for schwarzschild coordinates since @xmath28 depends upon the choice of the radial coordinate used to express the metric . since the impact parameter @xmath68 depends only upon the constants of the motion , the expression ( 19 ) will be invariant with respect to all choices of radial coordinates . of course the first order expression which yields the `` einstein angle '' is independent of the radial coordinate since to this order @xmath69 .",
    "the metric coefficients for the reissner - nordstrm solution are @xmath70 and @xmath42 . following the exact same procedure as for the schwarzschild case , equation ( [ equation : ugen ] )",
    "becomes @xmath71 so that the expanded form of equation ( [ equation : urn ] ) is @xmath72    since @xmath47 is assumed to be small , the last term involving the charge @xmath19 will be second order in @xmath45 as long as @xmath19 is less than or equal to @xmath9 ( i.e. there are no naked singularities present ) .",

    "the equations of geodesic motion for the kaluza - klein black hole spacetime will be in terms of the 5-dimensional coordinates .",
    "since the interest is in the behaviour of photons in four dimensions , we need to determine the equations in the 4d space .",
    "the first step to solving the geodesic equations is to determine what constants of the motion exist and this can be most easily be accomplished by analyzing the lagrangian associated with the metric ( [ equation : kkm ] ) @xmath77 - \\mathcal{d } \\left [ \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\lambda } + \\mathcal{a } \\frac{dt}{d \\lambda } \\right ] ^2   \\label{equation : lagr},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the metric coefficients derived in section ii . here",
    "@xmath36 is an affine parameter along the geodesic curve . as in the case of both the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions ,",
    "the test particle orbit remains in the plane defined by @xmath78 . with @xmath79",
    "the lagrangian ( [ equation : lagr ] ) leads directly to three constants of the motion :    @xmath80\\mathcal{a } \\\\ j & \\equiv & r^2 \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\lambda } \\\\ n & \\equiv &   \\mathcal{d } \\left [ \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\lambda } + \\mathcal{a}\\frac{dt}{d \\lambda } \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the constants @xmath35 and @xmath81 are , as before , related respectively to the angular momentum and the energy of the photons whereas the constant of motion @xmath82 must be proportional to the charge @xmath83 of the test particle in order to recover the lorentz force law in the appropriate limiting case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since it is the motion of photons that are of interest here , the line element and therefore the lagrangian @xmath84 must vanish .",
    "the test particle charge also vanishes which leaves only two non trivial constants of the motion along with the condition : @xmath85    therefore the radial equation of motion becomes , after substituting in the constants of the motion and the explicit expressions for the metric coefficients : @xmath86 .\\ ] ]    this equation can be written in the form : @xmath87 where the ` effective potential ' takes the form : @xmath88 which has a @xmath89 term for @xmath90 .",
    "the effective potential has a form similar to that for massive test particles in the schwarzschild spacetime and therefore will lead to trapped photon orbits in the vicinity of the 5d black hole .",
    "that is , the effective potential will have both a local minimum and a maximum . unlike the 4d case , one can have stable circular photon orbits for this particular kaluza - klein black hole . since the radius of the circular orbits are also energy dependent one would expect to see a `` rainbow '' effect if one were to pass through the region of stable photon orbits . as the charge approaches zero we just obtain the schwarzschild configuration where there is only an unstable orbit at a distance of three schwarzschild radii .",
    "for a non zero charge we find two critical orbits ; an unstable one closer to the black hole and a stable one located further outward .",
    "these orbits can be found at @xmath91\\ ] ]    returning to the weak lensing case where @xmath7 is always well outside of the the region close to the black hole we expect to obtain hyperbolic orbits and we will now proceed to derive a scattering angle for such trajectories .    the equation for the angle @xmath30 in terms of the radial position of the photon can be written as : @xmath92 this result reduces to the 4d schwarzschild result for photons when @xmath93 .    with the metric coefficients given by ( [ equation : kkmc1 ] ) , ( [ equation : kkmc2 ] ) , ( [ equation : kkmc3 ] ) and using ( [ equation : kkmc5 ] ) , one obtains for the inverse radial coordinate : @xmath94 since we are going to approximate the solution to this equation only at distances larger than the impact parameter , it can again be written in terms of a perturbation parameter @xmath45 , such that @xmath95 .",
    "the zeroth order solution to the now inhomogeneous equation is @xmath96 .",
    "if we now set @xmath97 , equation ( [ equation : ukk ] ) becomes @xmath98 .",
    "again expanding @xmath38 in terms of a power series in @xmath45 , the equations to first and second order in @xmath45 become : @xmath99 respectively .",

    "this is to be expected since the fifth dimension is then flat and will have no influence on the motion in the four lower dimensions .",
    "however when the charge does not vanish , there is a negative contribution to the deflection angle at first order and this should have a significant effect on gravitational lensing as compared to the reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "the effect becomes even more significant for small values of @xmath28 ( or equivalently @xmath103 ) as will be shown in the next section .",
    "the deflection angles can also be calculated exactly by finding an expression for the azimuthal angle in terms of the radial distance .",
    "following  8.5 of @xcite we find that the total deflection angle can be found by solving an integral in terms of the four dimensional metric coefficients .",
    "@xmath104 fortunately the metric coefficient associated with the fifth dimension does not come in into play for the motion of photons in the kaluza klein case since the last term in the line element was found to be zero for uncharged test particles .",
    "one can evaluate the above integral numerically using a standard simpson s rule method and setting the upper limit on the radial position to @xmath105 times the value of @xmath28 . a plot of the deflection angle @xmath106 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : angl ] ) shows that the deflection decreases as the charge on the black hole increases .",
    "this effect is clearly larger for the five dimensional kaluza - klein solution than it is for the reissner - nordstrm solution . when the charge on the black hole is zero , both the reissner - nordstrm and kaluza - klein solutions reduce to the schwarzschild solution .     total deflection angle @xmath107 ( in radians ) as a function of the inverse distance of closest approach @xmath108 ( in schwarzschild radii).,width=321 ]",
    "the deviations from the flat - space travel time ( i.e. the shapiro time delay ) for photons passing by a black hole can be estimated for all three geometries . rather than take the approach that was used to compute the bending angle ,",
    "the alternative is to use the formal integral expression obtained from the geodesic equation for the temporal coordinate , approximate the integrand to second order in the appropriate expansion parameter and then evaluate the resulting integrals term by term .",
    "following  8.7 of @xcite , we find that when curvature coordinates are used , the exact time delay is given by @xmath109 again some straightforward computations are required which are outlined in the following subsections .",
    "these spacetimes can be handled together by simply computing the results for the reissner - nordstrm solution and setting @xmath110 to obtain the schwarzschild result .",
