    "the recent renewed interest in the theoretical study of the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of isolated many - body quantum systems is largely motivated by extraordinary advances in experiments with ultracold atomic gases , which provide highly tunable set ups with very high degree of isolation from the environment @xcite . among many remarkable experimental results , one can mention the collapse and revival of matter - wave coherence after the sudden quench from a superfluid to a mott insulator @xcite , the finding that one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose gases can relax to nonthermal equilibrium states @xcite , and the almost perfect agreement between the nonequilibrium dynamics observed in experiments with 1d lattice bosons and numerically exact simulations of the unitary dynamics using the time - dependent renormalization group approach @xcite .",
    "motivated by the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite , intensive theoretical efforts have been devoted to understanding the description after relaxation of isolated integrable systems following a sudden change in a hamiltonian parameter ( sudden quench ) . in quenches between integrable systems ,",
    "in which the initial state is an eigenstate of an integrable hamiltonian ( usually the ground state ) , many studies have shown that observables do not relax to the thermal predictions @xcite . instead , they relax to the predictions of generalized gibbs ensembles ( gges ) , which take into account the presence of nontrivial sets of conserved quantities @xcite .",
    "the gge maximizes the entropy while taking into account the constraints imposed by those conserved quantities @xcite .",
    "microscopically , the gge has recently been shown to work for 1d lattice hard - core bosons @xcite because of a generalization of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the eigenstates of the final hamiltonian that overlap with the initial state have very similar expectation values of the conserved quantities ( properly accounted for in the gge ) and very similar expectation values of few - body observables , i.e. , eth is valid within that restricted set of eigenstates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for quenches very close to integrable points , there is a separation of time scales in which the system usually relaxes to a prethermalized state before thermalizing @xcite .",
    "observables in that prethermalized state have been shown to be described by a gge @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for quenches from eigenstates of nonintegrable systems to an integrable point , it has been argued that thermalization can occur because the initial state provides an unbiased sampling of the eigenstates in the final hamiltonian , very much as the thermal ensembles do @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , most works that have directly probed the nonequilibrium dynamics of isolated integrable systems have focused on initial states that are eigenstates ( usually the ground state ) of the hamiltonian before the quench .",
    "this opens questions as to how general the conclusions obtained in those studies are for more generic finite - temperature systems .",
    "thermal initial states were considered for quenches in the quantum ising model in ref .",
    "there , it was shown that for sufficiently high initial temperatures nearly thermal distributions occur for the conserved quantities after a sudden quench . since away from the critical point",
    "the quantum ising model is gapped , `` sufficiently high '' in this case means higher than the values of the relevant gaps .    in this work ,",
    "we study what happens for quenches starting from equilibrium finite - temperature states in 1d lattice hard - core bosons ( the @xmath0 model ) . within this model , a local chemical potential ( a site - dependent @xmath1 magnetic field )",
    "can be used to generate gaps in the spectrum .",
    "we focus on the resulting entropy and distribution of conserved quantities after a sudden quench and compare them to the predictions of thermal ensembles and the gge relevant to the final system in equilibrium .",
    "understanding the outcome of the relaxation dynamics for initial states at finite temperature is particularly important to address current ultracold gases experiments , where quenches are performed starting with the gas at some effective finite temperature .    in the previous and closely related work , we studied the same quantities and quenches similar to the ones considered here but starting from the ground state of the initial hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we showed that , if the initial state was the ground state of a half - filled system in a period 2 superlattice ( an insulating state ) , the distribution of conserved quantities after the superlattice was turned off approached that in thermal equilibrium upon increasing the superlattice strength .",
    "( an understanding of this phenomenon in terms of bipartite entanglement was recently provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) at the same time , the entropy of the gge approached that of the thermal ensemble ( grand - canonical ensemble ; ge ) .",
    "however , contrary to what happens in nonintegrable systems , the difference between the gge and the thermal ensemble predictions for the entropy and the conserved quantities did not vanish in the thermodynamic limit for any finite strength of the superlattice . for all other quenches considered in that work , the predictions of the gge and the thermal ensembles were quantitatively and qualitatively different .",
    "here we show that following a sudden quench and upon increasing the temperature of the initial state , similarly to what was found in ref .",
    "@xcite when increasing the strength of the initial superlattice potential and consistent with the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite for the quantum ising model , the distribution of conserved quantities and the entropy in the gge approach the thermal predictions .",
    "however , this should not be confused with thermalization , as , for any given initial finite temperature and finite hamiltonian parameters before and after the quench , the differences between the two ensembles remain finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence , our results show that for quenches between integrable systems , there is no fundamental difference between starting with an eigenstate of the hamiltonian and starting with a state in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thermalization does not generally occur in either case .",
    "the exposition is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model of interest , and the definition of the statistical ensembles and the observables studied . in sec .",
    "[ sec : weight ] , we discuss the behavior of the weights of the eigenstates of the final hamiltonian in various ensembles .",
    "the energy density distributions are also studied in that section .",
    "subsequently , in sec .  [",
    "sec : entropy ] , we study various entropies and perform a series of scaling analysis to assess finite - size effects as well as the influence of the control parameters in the properties of the system after the quench . a similar study , but for the behavior of the conserved quantities , is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conserved quantity ] .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we focus on the nonequilibrium properties of 1d lattice hard - core bosons following a sudden quench .",
    "this is an integrable model with hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hopping parameter and @xmath4 is the strength of a local alternating ( superlattice ) potential .",
    "we consider lattices with @xmath5 sites and open boundary conditions . the hard - core boson creation ( annihilation ) operators",

    "in addition to the bosonic commutation relations @xmath8=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , there applies a constraint that suppresses multiply occupancy of the lattice sites in all physical states , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "we note that , in the following , @xmath10 , and the hopping energy is set to @xmath11 ( our unit of energy ) .    to be solved exactly , this model can first be mapped onto the spin-1/2 @xmath0 hamiltonian through the holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite and , subsequently , via the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , to noninteracting fermions . instead of diagonalizing the full many - body hamiltonian , one can then write each many - body eigenstate in the form of a fermionic slater determinant with appropriate modifications following the mapping rules .",
    "these slater determinants are constructed as products of single - particle eigenstates of the noninteracting fermionic hamiltonian . utilizing properties of slater determinants",
    ", one can compute exactly all one - particle @xcite and two - particle @xcite observables in the eigenstates , at finite temperature in the ge @xcite , and out of equilibrium @xcite .    before the quench",

    ", we disconnect the system from the reservoir and change the strength of the alternating potential from its initial value @xmath15 to its final value @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the initial thermal state , which is a mixed state , can be expressed in the basis of the many - body eigenstates @xmath18 of the initial hamiltonian @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the many - body density matrix can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix is given by @xmath23 in which the time - evolving many - body eigenstates of the initial hamiltonian @xmath24 can be written in terms of the many - body eigenstates of the final hamiltonian , @xmath25 : @xmath26 following eq .  ,",
    "the infinite time average of eq .   can be written in the form of a diagonal density matrix , which corresponds to the so - called diagonal ensemble ( de ) @xcite , @xmath27 here , @xmath28 corresponds to the weight of state @xmath29 in the de .",
    "as we show below , @xmath28 is strongly dependent of the initial state temperature and the quench protocol . in eq .",
    ", the overlaps between eigenstates of the initial and those of the final hamiltonian @xmath30 are evaluated numerically as the determinant of the product of two matrices , with each matrix composed of the matrix elements of the slater determinant representing the eigenstates @xcite .",
    "note that the dimension of the hilbert space for our model is @xmath31 , and the computation time for the entire set of de weights is proportional to @xmath32 , i.e. , it is exponential in the system size .    the expectation value of any observable @xmath33 after relaxation , if relaxation takes place , is equal to the infinite - time average @xmath34 and can be calculated as @xmath35 $ ] @xcite . following the definition of the von neumann entropy @xmath36 $ ] , one can also calculate the entropy of the de as @xmath37 this entropy has recently been shown to satisfy the required properties of a thermodynamic entropy , namely , it increases when a system in equilibrium is taken out of equilibrium , it satisfies the fundamental thermodynamic relation @xcite , and it is additive and equal ( up to subextensive corrections ) to the entropy of thermal ensembles used to describe generic systems after relaxation @xcite .    here ,",
    "the de is compared with various statistical ensembles .",

    "we are first interested in learning how the weights @xmath28 are distributed among different eigenstates , how they depend on the initial temperature and quenching protocol , and how they compare to the weights of the eigenstates in the ce .",

    "the results are obtained for quenches @xmath71 to @xmath67 , and for three different initial temperatures .",

    "[ fig : weight 1](e ) and [ fig : weight 1](f ) ] , the bands in the de merge and the weights very closely resemble the canonical weights , i.e. , the expectation value of observables after relaxation in such quenches will be nearly thermal .",
    "it is not difficult to understand this because , in the @xmath74 limit , the initial thermal state will have a completely flat ( featureless ) distribution of conserved quantities .",
    "such a distribution of conserved quantities coincides with the one at infinite temperature in thermal equilibrium after the quench .",
    "hence , the initial state will essentially provide an unbiased sampling of the eigenstates that make the main contribution to the ce .",

    "[ fig : weight 1 ] , namely , a quench from @xmath68 to @xmath75 , are depicted in fig .",

    "@xcite , results for quenches starting from the ground state showed that only for half - filled systems and large values of @xmath15 does a gaussian shape develop in @xmath80 in the de . here",
    "we find that , at finite and not too low initial temperatures , the energy densities as well as other observables are qualitatively similar for different filling factors .",
    "this is in strong contrast with what happens for quenches starting from the ground state .",
    "such a contrast is expected , as the ground states for different fillings may be qualitatively different , e.g. , insulating at half - filling and superfluid away from half - filling , but those differences are washed out with increasing temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy dens ] , note that the gaussian like shape observed in the de is slightly wider that in the ce .",
    "however , the width of both gaussians is expected to vanish in the thermodynamic limit .    the results for quenches from @xmath68 to @xmath75 ( depicted in the figs .  [ fig : energy dens ] ) also develop a gaussian shape in both ensembles .",
    "however , this is less evident because of the presence of gaps in the spectrum . for these quenches",
    ", we also find that the results for the various observables studied here are qualitatively similar for different fillings when the temperatures are not too low . because of this , in the remainder of the paper we focus on the half - filled case .",

    "this is interesting because , for quenches starting from pure states that are eigenstates of the initial hamiltonian , gaussian - like energy distributions are only generically observed in nonintegrable systems @xcite .",
    "since the energy density is calculated through a coarse graining of the weights , in the following , we calculate the entropy associated with the de and compare it to the entropy in the ge and the gge .",

    "( ii ) for all quenches at finite temperature , @xmath86 is a fraction of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and our finite - size scaling analysis indicates that this will be the case in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , exponentially fewer states are involved in the de compared to the other two .",
