    "in the past years strong observational evidence of high rates of evolution for infrared ( ir ) galaxies has been obtained by means of two independent findings : the detection of a large amount of energy contained in the cosmic infrared background ( cirb , hauser & dwek 2001 ) , and the number counts from several deep cosmological surveys ( from 15 @xmath0 m to 850 @xmath0 m ) largely exceeding the no - evolution expectations .",
    "both results agree in requiring a strong increase in the ir energy density between the present time and @xmath1@xmath212 .",
    "the discovery of the cirb , which is interpreted as the integrated emission from dust present in galaxies , has offered new perspectives on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , since it provides a key constraint on the history of star - formation ( sf ) and accretion in the universe .",
    "the resolution of the cirb into individual sources has been one of the main goals for the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ; kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al . 2004 ) . the deep cosmological surveys carried out by _ iso _ and _ spitzer _ allowed new insights into the ir population contributing to the cirb , showing source counts in excess with respect to no - evolution predictions and revealing the existence of a population of distant , dusty ir - bright galaxies that are missed by optical surveys .",
    "the major contributors to the cirb are luminous ( l@xmath3 l@xmath4 , lirgs ) and ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( l@xmath5 l@xmath4 , ulirgs ) : they have been discovered by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ; neugebauer 1984 ) as rare objects in the local universe radiating most of their energy in the ir , but have been successively found by _ iso _ , _ spitzer _ and also _ scuba _ on the jcmt in the sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) , to become more and more important as the redshift increases . in particular , the so - called `` sub - mm galaxies '' ( smgs ) detected by _ scuba _",
    "( i.e. smail , ivison & blain 1997 ) and subsequently confirmed by _ spitzer _",
    "( i.e. pope et al .",
    "2006 ) , which emit a significant fraction of their rest - frame bolometric luminosity in the far - infrared ( fir)/sub - mm and seem to be mostly at @xmath6 , represent a direct evidence for that . the existence of this strongly evolving population of dusty , massive galaxies that form the bulk of their stars at high redshifts ( smgs and high - z ( u)lirgs are found to be already massive galaxies at @xmath7 ; i.e. dye et al .",
    "2008 ) , is an example of anti - hierarchical behaviour , showing how crucial this ir - bright , dust - obscured galaxy population is to understand galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "( _ spica _ ; nakagawa et al .",
    "2009 ) , open a new perspective to study in detail the population of ir galaxies beyond @xmath8 , requiring new models to explain the high rate of evolution observed at lower redshifts .",
    "two main weaknesses exist in most of the current models for ir sources : 1 ) the failure in reproducing the observed redshift distributions ; 2 ) the severe underestimate of the contribution from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the new models should take into account that ir galaxies can host both sf and agn activity ( i.e. lutz et al . 1998 ) and that in the far - infrared ( fir ) even the emission from seyfert and quasars can be dominated by sf ( lutz et al . 2004 ; schweitzer et al .",
    "2006 ; shao et al .",
    "we can no longer neglect the agn contribution in modelling and interpreting ir data , but we should rather understand and quantify the agn presence within ir galaxies and its connection with sf activity .",
    "in particular , a key cosmological question that needs to be answered by models and future observations regards the role of agn in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in fact , the seminal discovery that all massive galaxies in the local universe harbour super - massive black holes ( smbh ; @xmath9 ) implies that all massive galaxies have hosted agn at some time during their life ( i.e. magorrian et al .",
    "recent works in the x - rays , optical and mid - infrared ( mir ) have shown that many heavily obscured agns escape detection even in the deepest optical and x - ray observations , but , as expected from their high level of obscuration , reveal themselves in the ir ( i.e. daddi et al .",
    "2007 ; fiore et al .",
    "2008 ) . when planning future ir surveys with new facilities and/or when trying to interpret new data results , it is therefore necessary to consider models that properly take into account the presence of agns within a significant fraction of the ir population , in order to be able to answer the still open questions about galaxy formation and evolution , like i.e. what drives the evolution of the massive , dusty distant galaxy population ?",
    "what feedback / interplay exists between the agn and star - forming phase and how does it relate to cosmic downsizing ?    we have developed a new backward evolution model fitting all the main constraints provided by the ir / sub - mm surveys ( from 15 @xmath0 m to 500 @xmath0 m ) , where we have taken particular care in properly identifying and modelling the agn contribution at different luminosities and redshifts .",
    "our model starts from the classical approach consisting of evolving a local luminosity function ( llf ) in luminosity and/or density with redshift .",
    "in particular , we have decomposed the llf into different populations of galaxies and agns , each of them evolving independently . what is really new in this model is the way we have distinguished between the different ir populations : the separation into classes is based on a detailed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) study performed on a large spectroscopic sample of mir selected sources ( gruppioni et al .",
    "the shape of the sed provides a more meaningful physical characterisation of different populations than e.g. their luminosity , which is commonly used to separate ir sources into different classes ( i.e. ligs , uligs , hyligs ) .",
    "we have constrained our model by means of the mir ( i.e. from _ iso _ and _ spitzer _ ) and fir ( i.e. from _ herschel _ ) data .",
    "in particular , as constraints in the fir we have considered the very recent results of the pacs evolutionary probe ( pep ) survey ( berta et al .",
    "2010 ; gruppioni et al .",
    "2010 ) , of the _ herschel_-atlas ( h - atlas ) survey ( eales et al .",
    "2010 ; clements et al .",
    "2010 ) and of the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extra - galactic ( hermes ) survey ( oliver et al . 2010 ; vaccari et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the model evolutions and luminosity functions have then been used to derive the evolution with redshift of the star - formation and accretion densities from ir luminosity . to this purpose",

    "our model expectation is in very good agreement with all the ir data estimates , confirming the rapid increase of @xmath20 up to @xmath1@xmath21 .",

    "therefore , galaxies likely to contain a low - luminosity agn and galaxies powered by a starburst are responsible for the peak of the ir luminosity density at @xmath1@xmath212 , then galaxies hosting increasingly powerful agns become increasingly important towards the higher @xmath1 s .    the total ir emissivity predicted by our model at @xmath1@xmath222 is lower and shows a faster convergence than previously published results based on uv / optical or h@xmath21 observations ( i.e. hopkins & beacom , 2006 ) , which are subject to large extinction corrections , or on 24-@xmath0 m data ( i.e. perez - gonzalez 2005 ) , which require large spectral extrapolations to derive the total ir luminosity , especially at high redshifts .",

    "also our model expectations are very uncertain , since no constraint from data at @xmath1@xmath2222.5 are available from pre-_herschel _ surveys . the large numbers of high-@xmath1 galaxies provided by the deep surveys performed with _ herschel _ ( and furtherly with _ spica _ ) will be crucial to assess galaxy and agn evolution in the ir at @xmath1@xmath222.5 .",

    "the geometry correction is based on statistical arguments , employing the ratio between obscured and unobscured quasars as required by recent x - ray background synthesis models ( gilli et al .",
    "2007 ) to infer a typical torus covering factor of @xmath40 ( hence @xmath37@xmath261.5 ) . as reported by vasudevan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , this value is also consistent with the covering factor obtained from recent detailed clumpy torus models ( i.e. nenkova et al .",
    "2008 ) for typical torus parameters ( e.g. number of line - of - sight clouds @xmath41 , opening angle @xmath230 - 45@xmath42 ) .",
    "the effect of orientation was computed from the ratio between the luminosities of a face - on and an edge - on agn using the agn seds of silva et al . (",
    "consistent results were derived in pozzi et al.(2010 ) using a more sophisticated approach , i.e. computing the bolometric corrections using the best - fitting torus models , as the ratio between the accretion disk luminosity given as input to the radiative transfer model and the observed reprocessed infrared luminosity in output ( see fig . 4 from the pioneering work of pier & krolik 1992 ) .",
    "since the latter approach implies an exploitation of the degeneracy of the torus solutions which is beyond the scope of the present work , we prefer the first , simpler and straightforward , method .",

    "the uncertainty region of the single contributions and of the total estimate have been obtained by considering , as for the sfd , the sed - fitting and spectroscopic fractions of the different agn types respectively as upper and lower limits in our calculations .",
    "we note that for the agn1 and agn2 sed objects the difference between the numbers derived by sed - fitting and by optical spectroscopy is small , while for the llagn the fraction of spectroscopically confirmed agns is only about 30% of the sed - fitting one ( see gruppioni et al .",
    "however , even considering the lower limits for objects containing an agn , which conservatively takes into account the possibility that a significant fraction of our llagn are not agns , but starburst galaxies not well reproduced by our limited set of templates , the global result of our analysis does not change significantly .",

    "the bhar obtained from our ir estimate is reasonably consistent in shape with previous derivations from x - rays ( i.e. merloni , rudnick & di matteo 2004 ; merloni & heinz 2008 ) , though it is about a factor of @xmath22 higher at 1@xmath47@xmath1@xmath473 , where the bhar peaks . note that the derivation of bhar from ir luminosity is completely independent from that obtained from x - ray data and requires bolometric corrections at least a factor of @xmath210 lower and probably less uncertain than those required from observations in the x - ray band ( @xmath21.52 against @xmath21040 in the x - rays ) .",
