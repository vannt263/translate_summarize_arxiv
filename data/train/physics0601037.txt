    "the study of the wave propagation in optical periodic structures such as photonic crystals  @xcite has attracted growing interest in recent years .",
    "the periodic photonic structures exhibit unique properties allowing to manipulate the flow of light at the wavelength scale and create the basis for novel types of integrated optical devices .",
    "in such periodic dielectric structures , the propagation of light is governed by the familiar bloch theorem due to the interplay between the light and the surrounding periodic structure  @xcite , that introduces the spatially extended linear waves , the so - called bloch waves , as the eigenmodes of the corresponding periodic potential .",
    "thus , the properties of electromagnetic waves in periodic structures are fully determined by the bloch wave dispersion which , for the spatial beam propagation , represents the relation between the longitudinal and transverse components of the bloch wavevector .",
    "since any finite beam can be expressed as a superposition of such bloch waves  @xcite , the beam propagation in any periodic structure is also determined from the local dispersion .",
    "in particular , the beam propagation direction is defined by the normal to the dispersion curve while the beam spreading is governed by the curvature of this curve .",
    "the study of bloch waves and their temporal and spatial dispersion provides a key information about overall properties of any periodic structure .",
    "in particular , depending on the local dispersion and a local value of the wave vector , an optical beam ( or pulse ) experience normal , anomalous or even vanishing diffraction ( or dispersion )  @xcite . experimentally , the bloch - wave character of electromagnetic waves in photonic crystal waveguides has been deduced indirectly by detecting the out - of - plane leakage of light  @xcite , by investigating the evanescent field coupling between a tapered optical fiber and a photonic crystal waveguide  @xcite , and more directly by local near - field probing of the intensity distribution in a waveguide  @xcite .",
    "the full band structure of a photonic crystal waveguide has been recovered very recently by employing a near - field optical microscope and probing both the local phase and amplitude of the light propagating through a single - line defect waveguide  @xcite .",
    "the bloch - wave dynamics in periodic structures becomes even more dramatic in the presence of the nonlinear medium response that may lead to the formation of strongly localized structures , discrete and gap solitons  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the bloch modes of nonlinear periodic structures have been extensively studied in the one - dimensional geometries , including the bragg gratings and waveguide arrays  @xcite , as well as the study of modulational instability of one - dimensional waves  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the brillouin zone structure of nonlinear two - dimensional photonic lattices was characterized based on the features of collective wave dynamics for partially coherent multi - band excitations  @xcite . nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no experimental studies of individual two - dimensional bloch waves from different bands and probing the bloch wave local dispersion have been reported yet .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we probe the local spatial dispersion of the bloch modes of a two - dimensional optically - induced photonic lattice by analyzing the evolution of linear and nonlinear propagation modes associated with the high - symmetry points of the first brillouin zone . in particular",
    ", we excite the bloch waves associated with the high - symmetry points of the two - dimensional lattice by matching their unique phase structure and observe different regimes of the linear diffraction .",
    "second , we employ a strong self - focusing nonlinearity and study nonlinear self - action effects for the two - dimensional bloch waves .",
    "this allows us to probe and characterize the spatial diffraction of each particular bloch mode , depending on the curvature of the dispersion surfaces at the corresponding point of the brillouin zone .",

    "dots indicate the main symmetry points .",
    "inset in ( b ) depicts the corresponding first brillouin zone . ]",
    "[ sect : theory ]    we study the propagation of an extraordinary polarized optical beam ( a probe beam ) in a biased photorefractive crystal with an optically induced two - dimensional photonic lattice .",
    "we consider a spatially periodic pattern of the refractive index in the form of a square lattice , which is stationary in the longitudinal ( @xmath1 ) direction [ fig .",
    "[ fig : bandgap](a ) ] .",
    "the photonic lattice is formed by the interference of four mutually coherent ordinary polarized optical beams . this interference pattern [ fig .",
    "[ fig : bandgap](a ) ] , @xmath3+\\cos[\\pi ( x - y)/d]\\}^2 , \\ ] ] induces a refractive index modulation of the crystal for extraordinary polarized light via the strong electro - optic effect  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are the transverse coordinates , and @xmath6 is the lattice period .",
    "the spatial evolution of the extraordinary polarized beam with a slowly varying amplitude @xmath7 propagating along the lattice is then governed by the following nonlinear parabolic equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 describes the refractive index change that includes the two - dimensional lattice itself and the self - induced index change from the probe beam .",
    "the parameters used for numerical calculations are chosen to match the conditions of typical experiments discussed below : the dimensionless variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath1 are normalized to the typical scale @xmath10 , and @xmath11 mm , respectively ; the diffraction coefficient is @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the refractive index of a bulk photorefractive crystal , @xmath14 nm is the laser wavelength in vacuum , the parameter @xmath15 is the constant dark irradiance , @xmath16 is a nonlinear coefficient proportional to the electro - optic coefficient and the applied dc electric field , lattice modulation is @xmath17 , and @xmath18 m is the lattice period .",
    "such a periodic modulation of the refractive index results in the formation of a bandgap spectrum for the transverse components of the wave vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ". then the propagation of linear waves through the lattice is described by the spatially extended two - dimensional eigenmodes , known as the two - dimensional bloch waves .",
    "they can be found as solutions of linearized equation  ( [ eq : nls ] ) in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a periodic function with the periodicity of the underlying lattice , and @xmath23 is the propagation constant . for a square lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandgap](a ) , the dispersion relation @xmath24 is invariant with respect to the translations @xmath25 , and therefore is fully defined by its values in the first brillouin zone [ fig .  [ fig : bandgap](b , inset ) ] .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath26 for this lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandgap](b ) where the high - symmetry points of the lattice are marked by red dots .",
    "it is important to note that , for the chosen lattice parameters , there exists a full two - dimensional band gap between the first and the second spectral band .",
    "the existence of a typical bandgap structure of the lattice with a complete two - dimensional gap and the highly nonlinear properties of the photorefractive crystal make the optically - induced photonic lattice a direct _ analog of a two - dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal_. therefore , our experiments offer an ideal test - bench for the similar phenomena with highly nonlinear and tunable two - dimensional photonic crystals that may be studied in the future with fabricated structures in nonlinear materials .",
    "intensity ( top ) and phase ( bottom ) of different bloch modes from the high symmetry points of the first and second band of a square lattice .",
    "the blue color for the phase distribution corresponds to the zero phase , while the red color corresponds to the @xmath27 phase . ]",
    "the intensity and phase structure of the calculated bloch waves for the high symmetry points of the lattice from the first and second spectral bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : blochmodes ] .",
    "the upper row shows the bloch - wave intensity profiles and the bottom row shows the corresponding phase structure . as a reference",
    ", the first column shows the light intensity of the lattice itself .",
    "for the two - dimensional bloch waves from the first band , the intensity distribution of all modes is reflecting the structure of the square lattice , with the intensity maxima coinciding with those of the lattice .",
    "however , the phase structure differs substantially . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : blochmodes ] , the phase of the two - dimensional bloch waves originating from the @xmath28 point is constant .",
    "the phase structure becomes nontrivial for the modes from the x@xmath29 and m@xmath29 points .",
    "for the x@xmath29 ( y@xmath29 ) point , the phase represents a stripe - like pattern being constant along one principal direction of the lattice and exhibiting @xmath27 phase jumps along the other direction . for the bloch waves originating from the m@xmath29 point the phase distribution resembles a chessboard pattern .    on the other hand , the two - dimensional bloch modes from the second spectral band have the intensity maxima centered between the maxima of the square lattice .",
    "the phase structure has a form of stripes oriented along one of the principal directions of the two - dimensional lattice for the x@xmath30 point , or in @xmath31 with respect to the principal axes for the m@xmath30 point .",
    "the @xmath32 point appears to be nearly degenerate with the propagation constants nearly the same for the second , third , and fourth bands , and we do not consider it here .    the difference in the phase structure of the two - dimensional bloch waves translates into the differences in propagation dynamics for beams of a finite size which spectrum is localized in the vicinity of the corresponding high - symmetry points in the brillouin zone . indeed , the alternating phase is a signature of strong bragg scattering , that may lead to an enhanced diffraction of beams similar to the effect of the dispersion enhancement in the bragg gratings  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the beams can experience anisotropic diffraction due to the asymmetric phase structure of the corresponding bloch waves , and this can be detected by analyzing the beam broadening in the linear regime .",
    "the sign of the curvature of the related dispersion surface can be identified experimentally utilizing the nonlinear self - action of the beam . in the case of a medium with positive ( self - focusing ) nonlinearity ,",
    "increasing input beam intensity will result in either focusing or defocusing of the output beam depending on whether the curvature of the dispersion surface is convex or concave , respectively . a close examination of the spatial dispersion defined by the bandgap spectrum of the lattice [ fig .",
    "[ fig : bandgap](b ) ] shows that the beams associated with the @xmath28 and x@xmath30 points will experience self - focusing in both @xmath33 directions due to the convex curvature along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions .",
    "on the other hand , the beams associated with the m@xmath29 point will experience nonlinear self - spreading due to the concave curvature at the corresponding point of the dispersion surface .",
    "totally different behavior is expected for the beams associated with the x@xmath29 point of the lattice spectrum , as the curvatures of the dispersion surface are opposite in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions .",
    "such beams will experience an anisotropic nonlinear response : they will focus along the direction of the constant phase and at the same time will self - defocus in the orthogonal direction .",
    "the symmetry point m@xmath30 of the dispersion curve is degenerate between the second and the third bands , with both bands having opposite but isotropic curvatures . due to this degeneracy",
    "the nonlinear self - action of the beams associated with this point will result in a complex beam dynamics .",

    "is placed in the focal plane of the telescope to eliminate higher - order spectral components and ensure that the optical beam entering the crystal will have the phase and amplitude structure required to match the specific bloch mode .",
    "the modulated probe beam is combined with the lattice onto a beam splitter .",
