    "the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) is foundational to our understanding of gravity .",
    "it states that ( i ) all test bodies fall with the same acceleration regardless of their composition ( the weak equivalence principle , or wep ) and ( ii ) the outcome of any local nongravitational test experiment is independent of the velocity and the spacetime orientation and location of the ( freely - falling ) apparatus @xcite .",
    "theories which obey the eep , such as general relativity and brans - dicke theory are called metric theories because they endow spacetime with a metric @xmath3 that couples universally to all non - gravitational fields .",
    "non - metric theories do not have this feature : they break universality by coupling auxiliary gravitational fields directly to matter . in this context",
    "a violation of the eep means the breakdown of either local position invariance ( lpi ) or local lorentz invariance ( lli ) ( or both ) so that observers performing local experiments could detect effects due to their position ( if lpi is violated ) or their velocity ( if lli is violated ) in an external gravitational environment by using clocks and rods of differing composition .",
    "limits on lpi and lli are set by gravitational red - shift and atomic physics experiments respectively @xcite , each of which compares relative frequencies of transitions between particular energy levels that are sensitive to any potential lpi / lli - violating effects .",
    "the next generation of gravitational experiments will significantly extend our current understanding of the empirical foundations of the eep . a proposed etvs experiment in space , known as the satellite test of the equivalence principle ( step )",
    "attempts to test wep to one part in @xmath4 .",
    "the precision of gravitational red shift experiments could be improved to one part in @xmath5 by placing a hydrogen maser clock on board solar probe , a proposed spacecraft ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the dominant form of energy governing the transitions these experiments probe is nuclear electrostatic energy , although violations of wep / eep due to other forms of energy ( virtually all of which are associated with baryonic matter ) have also been estimated @xcite . however there",
    "exist many other physical systems , dominated by primarily non - baryonic energies , for which the validity of the eep is comparatively less well understood @xcite .",
    "such systems include photons of differing polarization @xcite , antimatter systems @xcite , neutrinos @xcite , mesons @xcite , massive leptons , hypothesized dark matter , second and third generation matter , and quantum vaccum energies .",
    "indeed , potential violations of the eep due to vacuum energy shifts , which are peculiarly quantum - mechanical in origin ( _ i.e. _ do not have a classical or semi - classical description ) provide an interesting empirical regime for gravitation and quantum mechanics .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects that eep - violating couplings have on lamb - shift transition energies .",
    "such transitions arise solely due to the radiative corrections inherent in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "a test of the eep for this form of energy therefore provides us with a qualitatively new empirical window of the foundations of gravitational theory .",
    "the lamb shift is the shift in energy levels of a hydrogenic atom due to radiative corrections .",
    "such energy shifts break the degeneracy between states of with the same principal quantum number and total angular momentum , but differing orbital and spin angular momenta .",
    "the best known example is the energy shift between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states in a hydrogen - like atom , which arises due to interactions of the electron with the quantum - field - theoretic fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . for metric theories ,",
    "the lowest order contribution for the lamb shift is @xmath6 mhz for hydrogen atoms .",
    "there is a @xmath7 mhz discrepancy with the experimental value of@xmath8 mhz @xcite or @xmath9 mhz @xcite , that can be improved with the inclusion of higher order terms and corrections coming from the structure and recoil of the nucleus .",
    "any breakdown of lpi / lli is determined entirely by the form of the couplings of the gravitational field to matter since local , nongravitational test experiments simply respond to their external gravitational environment .",
    "to explore such effects it is necesssary to develop a formalism capable of representing such couplings for as wide a class of gravitational theories as possible .",
    "we consider in this paper lagrangian - based theories in which the dynamical equations governing the evolution of the gravitational and matter fields can be derived from the action principle [ action0 ] d^4xld^4x(l_g+l_ng)=0 .",
    "the gravitational part @xmath10 of the lagrangian density contains only gravitational fields ; it determines the dynamics of the free gravitational field .",
    "the nongravitational part @xmath11 contains both gravitational and matter fields and defines the couplings between them .",
    "the dynamics of matter in an external gravitational field follow from the action principle [ action1 ] d^4xl_ng=0 by varying all matter fields in an external gravitational environment .",
    "we work in the context of a wide class of non - metric theories of gravity as described by the formalism @xcite .",
    "phenomenological models of @xmath11 provide a general framework for exploring the range of possible couplings of the gravitational field to matter and , thus , the range of mechanisms that might conceivably break lpi or lli .",
    "the formalism is one such model .",
    "it deals with the dynamics of charged particles and electromagnetic fields in a static , spherically symmetric gravitational field .",
    "in addition to all metric theories of gravitation , the formalism encompasses a wide class of non - metric theories .",
    "a quantum - mechanical extension of the original classical formalism was developed by will @xcite to calculate the energy shifts ( due to _ e.g. _ hyperfine effects ) in hydrogenic atoms at rest in a gravitational field . since the ticking rate of a hydrogen - maser clock is governed by the transition between a pair of these atomic states , this extension can be used to determine the effect of the gravitational field on the ticking rate of such clocks .",
    "this provides a basis for a quantitative interpretation of gravitational redshift experiments which employ hydrogen - maser clocks , for example , the gravity probe a rocket - redshift experiment @xcite .",
    "such experiments are a direct test of lpi .",
    "this formalism was further extended by gabriel and haugan @xcite who calculated the effects the motion of an atomic system through a gravitational field would have on the ticking rate of hydrogen - maser and other atomic clocks .",
    "their extension can be used to compute energies of hyperfine and other energy shifts of hydrogen atoms in motion through a field . here the physical effect under consideration is time dilation rather than the gravitational redshift .",
    "when lli is broken , the rates of clocks of different types that move together through the gravitational field are slowed by different time - dilation factors .",
    "this nonuniversal behavior is a characteristic symptom of the breakdown of lli @xcite , just as nonuniversal gravitational redshift is the hallmark of lpi violation @xcite .",
    "we are concerned in this paper with extending this analysis to the lamb shift , an energy shift whose origin is due to radiative corrections .",
    "we compute the gravitationally modified ( gm ) lamb shift in a field , and then discuss experiments which could potentially measure such effects .",
    "we find both eep - violating contributions to the lamb shift from the semiclassical hamiltonian and its radiative corrections .",
    "the semiclassical contribution violates lli only and is isotropic ; the radiative corrections violate both lli and lpi and are not isotropic .",
    "these contributions are functions of non - metric parameters which arise in the leptonic sector of the standard model , and so are not constrained by previous high - precision experiments which have set stringent bounds for analogous parameters in the baryonic sector @xcite .",
    "of course all such contributions vanish for metric theories .    in order to calculate the ( gm ) radiative corrections",
    ", we shall modify the feynman rules of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) within the context of the formalism .",
    "although we can not use lpi / lli symmetries , the gauge invariance of the theory is still present .",
    "we shall be concerned with the one photon contribution to the ( gm ) lamb shift up to order @xmath12 , with the nucleus treated as a fixed point charge .",
    "we do not include further ( higher - order ) refinements , since we are interested in the role of lamb shift energies in the investigation of possible lpi / lli violations and so expect any such violations to be qualitatively different from higher order corrections .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the action is introduced and extended to frames moving with respect to the preferred frame defined by the gravitational field .",
    "this formalism is then used to calculate the electromagnetic fields produced by a point - like charge and to formulate ( gm)qed . in sec .",
    "iii the ( gm ) dirac equation is used to find the energy levels of hydrogenic atoms , and we compute the radiative corrections for those states in sec .",
    "iv . in sec . v the gm lamb shift is related to redshift and time dilation parameters to study possible lpi and lli violations respectively .",
    "final conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "several appendices summarize details of our calculations .",
    "the formalism was constructed to study electromagnetically interacting charged structureless test particles in an external , static , spherically symmetric ( sss ) gravitational field , encompassing a wide class of non - metric ( and all metric ) gravitational theories .",
    "originally employed as a computational framework designed to test schiff s conjecture @xcite , it permits one to extract quantitative information about the implications of eep - violation that can be compared to experiment .",
    "it assumes that the non - gravitational laws of physics can be derived from an action : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the rest mass , charge , and world line of particle @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . the parameters @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are arbitrary functions of the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath24 ( which approaches unity as @xmath25 ) , as are @xmath26 and @xmath27 which in general will depend upon the species of particles within the system ( leptons in the present case ) .",
    "a quantum mechanical extension of the action ( [ 1 ] ) which incorporates the dirac lagrangian was used by will @xcite to study the energy levels of hydrogen atoms . in that case a local approximation to the action is employed .",
    "the spacetime scale of atomic systems allows one to ignore the spatial variations of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and evaluate them at the center of mass position of the system , @xmath28 .",
    "this work was further extended by gabriel and haugan @xcite who showed that after rescaling coordinates , charges , and electromagnetic potentials , the field theoretic extension of the action ( [ 1 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath29 where local natural units are used , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 with the subindex `` 0 '' denoting the functions evaluated at @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is the ratio of the local speed of light to the limiting speed of the species of massive particle under consideration .    the action ( [ 1 ] ) ( or ( [ act ] ) ) has been widely used in the study of lpi / lli violating effects such as the effect of non - metric gravitational fields on the differential ticking rates of different types of atomic clocks , a violation of lpi @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the electrostatic structure of atoms and nuclei in motion through a gravitational field using ( [ 1 ] ) shows that the non - metric couplings encompassed by the formalism can also break lli @xcite .",
    "this symmetry is broken when the local speed of light @xmath33 differs from the limiting speed of a given species of massive particle @xmath34 , the latter being normalized to unity in ( [ act ] ) .",
    "further implications of the breakdown of lli on various aspects of atomic and nuclear structure have also been investigated .",
    "shifts in energy levels ( including the hyperfine splitting ) of hydrogenic atoms in motion through a gravitational field have been calculated @xcite by transforming the representation of the action ( [ act ] ) to a local coordinate system in which the atom is initially at rest and then analyzing the atom s structure in that frame .",
    "the local coordinate system in which the action is represented by eq .",
    "( [ act ] ) , is called the preferred frame ; moving frames are those systems of local coordinates that move relative to the preferred frame .    in the present work we generalize this analysis by using the action ( [ act ] ) to study radiative corrections to bound state energy levels in hydrogenic atoms .",
    "we follow the scheme given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and analyze the atomic states in moving frames whose velocity is @xmath35 .",
    "consider an atom that moves with velocity @xmath35 relative to the preferred frame .",
    "the moving frame in which this atom is initially at rest is defined by means of a standard lorentz transformation . a convenient representation @xcite of the action in this new coordinate system if the nongravitational fields @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 transform via the corresponding lorentz transformations laws for dirac , vector , and electromagnetic fields is , to @xmath40 , @xmath41\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the electromagnetic 4-current associated with some external source ( taken here to be a pointlike spinless nucleus ) . in our formulation ,",
    "all non metric effects arise from the inequality between @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the electromagnetic sector of the action .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath45 measures the degree to which lpi / lli is broken for a given species of particle .",
    "the natural scale for @xmath46 in theories that break local lorentz invariance is set by the magnitude of the dimensionless newtonian potential , which empirically is much smaller than unity in places we can imagine performing experiments @xcite .",
    "we are therefore able to compute effects of the terms in eq .",

    "this ` semiclassical ' nonmetric contribution to the lamb shift is isotropic in the 3-velocity @xmath35 of the moving frame and vanishes when @xmath94 . hence it violates lli but not lpi .    in order to proceed to a computation of the relevant radiative corrections , we need to find the perturbative corrections for the energies and spinor states given by ( [ e ] ) and ( [ n ] ) respectively .",
