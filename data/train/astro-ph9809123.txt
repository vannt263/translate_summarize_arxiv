    "the narrow line regions ( nlr ) of active galaxies are the largest structures which directly derive their energy input from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "in many nearby seyfert galaxies the nlr are spatially resolved , and often extend over distances of several kpc , so that the energy input processes may be studied in detail .",
    "such spatially - resolved nlr are often referred to as extended narrow line regions ( enlr ) ( @xcite 1987 ) . in both seyfert 1 and seyfert  2 galaxies",
    "the enlr appears as a filamentary system of high excitation gas and in seyfert  2 galaxies this gas is often confined to a bi - cone structure centred on the nucleus , the so called `` ionization cones '' . in other cases , the morphology is more complex , and bent jet - like structures are sometimes observed .",
    "according to the model developed some twenty years ago ( @xcite 1978 ; @xcite 1983 ; @xcite 1984 ) , and which remains the dominant paradigm ( @xcite 1987 , @xcite 1992 ) , the nlr are excited by photoionization by a powerful ( approximately power - law ) non - thermal uv continuum produced by the agn .",
    "this scenario appeals to the unified schemes for agn in which the nucleus and the broad - line region are surrounded by an optically thick torus ( @xcite 1985 ) . in this picture",
    "the differences between seyfert types 1 and 2 are ascribed to an orientation effect in which type 1 seyferts are oriented so that the line of sight falls within the opening angle of the cones , while in type 2 seyferts the line of sight to the nuclear region is obscured by the torus .",
    "this scenario explains the conical enlr observed in some type 2 seyferts as due to shadowing of the ionizing radiation from the nucleus by the absorbing torus .",
    "shocks may also be important for the morphology , kinematics and excitation of the nlr in seyfert galaxies . in some seyferts the morphology of the emission line gas",
    "is directly related to that of the radio emission , providing evidence for dynamical interaction between the radio plasma and the ambient interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "for example , high resolution narrow band imaging with hst has revealed bow - shock shaped emission line regions around radio lobes , and jet - like emission line regions in sources with jet - like radio structures ( @xcite 1998 , @xcite 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "shocks probably dominate the physics of the large scale outflows observed in seyfert galaxies . in a series of papers , (",
    "@xcite 1996a , @xcite 1996b , @xcite 1998 ) colbert and collaborators show that optical emission suggestive of large scale outflows is present in @xmath3 of their sample of 22 edge - on seyfert galaxies , @xmath4 of the sample have kiloparsec scale radio structures , and 3 of their sample , including ngc  2992 , have similarly extended soft x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite ( 1998 ) favour an interpretation in which these large scale outflows originate as agn driven non - thermal jets that entrain the surrounding thermal material , and heat it by shocks over kpc spatial scales .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the x - ray gas results from starburst driven winds from the circumnuclear region .",
    "seyfert galaxies are radio quiet , and simple equipartition arguments have long suggested that the pressure in the relativistic plasma responsible for the radio wavelength synchrotron emission is inadequate to drive high velocity shocks into the interstellar medium ( @xcite 1988 ) .",
    "however , this picture may be wrong if mass entrainment into the jet occurs close enough to the source .",
    "recently @xcite ( 1998 ) has shown that although the radio jets of seyferts start off mildly relativistic , over most of their length the internal energies of seyfert jets must be dominated by thermal plasma .",
    "the combined pressure of the thermal and relativistic gas is then sufficient for the jets to power the optical emission of the nlr .",
    "this idea finds observational support from the work of @xcite ( 1998 ) which suggests that the large scale outflows in seyfert galaxies are predominantly winds of thermal x - ray emitting gas .",
    "this thermal phase will dominate the pressure , consistent with the requirements of the theory described in @xcite ( 1998 ) .",
    "models of shocks for seyfert galaxies have considered various scenarios for the excitation of the gas .",
    "bow - shock models developed by @xcite ( 1992 ) ( which can account for the wide range of line profile shapes observed in the nlr ) consider the excitation mechanism to be photoionization , whereby the shocks simply serve to compress the gas which is then illuminated by uv continuum from the nucleus .",
    "more recent models show that shocks themselves can provide an alternative mechanism for the ionization of the nlr based on the input of mechanical energy .",
    "these shock models advanced by @xcite ( 1993 ) and developed in detail by @xcite ( 1996 ) show that high velocity shocks generate strong uv radiation in the high temperature cooling zone behind the shock front , the hardness of which depends on the shock velocity .",
    "this photon field is then available to produce a highly ionized precursor region , which emits a spectrum like that observed in the nlr .",
    "@xcite ( 1995 ) find that their shock+precursor models can account for the observed optical emission line ratios of a sample of seyfert galaxies .",
    "this raised the possibility that such models may be generally applicable to narrow emission line regions .    in order to find observational support in favour of either the shock or the photoionization model of the nlr ,",
    "we have undertaken a detailed spectroscopic and dynamical study of the enlr of a number of nearby seyferts . amongst these",
    ", the subject of this paper , ngc  2992 provides a particularly good test case to compare the predictions of the models with observations .",
    "ngc  2992 is a gas - rich ( @xcite 1982 ; @xcite 1985 ) sa type galaxy classified as having a seyfert 1.9 active nucleus .",
    "it is inclined at @xmath570  to our line of sight and is crossed by a disturbed dust lane .",
    "it is interacting with ngc  2993 which is connected to the southern part of ngc  2992 by a tidal tail with a projected length of 2.9 .",
    "the nuclear redshift is z=0.0077@xmath6 which gives angular scale 150 pc arcsec@xmath7 assuming h@xmath8=75 km  s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "it provides an interesting test case because it displays a striking and unusually extensive bi - conical enlr which emerges almost perpendicularly from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "narrow band images show the spatial extent of bright bi - cones is @xmath54 kpc , with the se cone brighter than the nw cone . fainter emission is extended up to 8 kpc .",
    "figures 1a and 1b show narrow band filter images obtained at the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) .",
    "these are respectively [ ]  @xmath15007 , and h@xmath2 + [ ] and are presented on a logarithmic stretch so as to bring out the fainter regions .",
    "figure  1c shows a blue continuum image of ngc  2992 .",
    "the radio structure of ngc  2992 is described in detail in a paper by @xcite ( 1988 ) which includes a synopsis of previous radio observations . in summary ngc  2992",
    "has 20 cm radio emission which extends approximately 25  along pa@xmath9160 , and has a one sided extension along pa@xmath9130 . at a wavelength of 6 cm",
    "there is visible a smaller scale figure-8-shaped structure , with its long axis extending approximately 8  along pa@xmath9 - 26 , and centred on the nucleus .",
    "the figure-8 may represent edge brightened bubbles of relativistic plasma or else magnetically - compressed arches , either of which are indicative of an expanding region of over - pressured relativistic plasma .",
    "however , comparison of the radio images with optical narrow band images shows no obvious correlation between the structures - see figures 1d , 1e and 1f where these radio maps are overlaid on our [ ]  @xmath15007 , and continuum images .",
    "ngc  2992 was included in durret and bergeron s investigation of the physical properties of the ionized gas in emission line galaxies ( @xcite 1988 , @xcite 1990 ) . in the earlier paper they present long slit observations of ngc  2992 .",
    "the second paper describes the physical properties of the ionized gas and other general characteristics derived from their spectra .",
    "here we briefly summarise their results .",
    "first , in the nuclear spectrum a broad component of h@xmath2 is detectable , but there is no corresponding broad h@xmath10 component .",
    "ngc  2992 is therefore classified as an intermediate type seyfert ( 1.9 ) .",
    "this classification is confirmed from the shape of the far - ir to far - uv continuum ( @xcite 1986 ) .",
    "second , @xcite ( 1988 ) found the extranuclear spectra along pa = 197  have similar line ratios to the nuclear region , and are characteristic of those found in seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "this excludes the possibility that the enlr is excited by ob stars .",
    "the excitation of the gas appears to decrease from the nucleus to the outer regions .",
    "the reddening of the inner regions is high , ranging up to a@xmath113 , and a similar reddening was estimated by @xcite ( 1983 ) from the [ ]  @xmath12(4069 + 4076)/(6717 + 6731 ) ratio .",
    "third , using the h@xmath2/h@xmath10 to correct line ratios for reddening @xcite ( 1988 ) found a temperature of t@xmath13=19900k from the [ ] lines in the nuclear regions .",
    "the velocity field of ngc  2992 is complex . a kinematical study by @xcite ( 1987 ) revealed blue asymmetries in the [ ] lines at the center of the galaxy , and showed that the nuclear region is dynamically decoupled from the off - nuclear regions . @xcite ( 1987 )",
    "find some indication of radial outflow within a plane highly inclined to the galaxy plane , and that the kinematics of the se region may be accounted for by tidal interaction with ngc  2993 .",
    "recently @xcite ( 1998 ) have reported a kinematical study of ngc  2992 with the h@xmath2 and [ ] lines measured along nine position angles .",
    "they note that outflow of the gas within a conical envelope or on the surface of a hollow cone as one possible picture to account for the double peaked profiles and assymetries detected in several regions .",
    "however they use a simple kinematical model of circular rotation with a constant radial outflow , where the out - flowing velocities are considered as radial motions in a plane very close to that of the gas disk . while this model provides a good approximation to the observed kinematics we caution that such a model is not unique , and prefer to interpret the kinematics as a general outflow or wind , not necessarily constrained to a particular plane .",
    "this was reported briefly by us in @xcite ( 1995 ) and details will appear in a future paper . in summary ,",
    "our higher spectral resolution study of the ngc  2992 nlr shows double component line profiles at most positions .",
    "one of the kinematical components follows a galactic rotation curve , while the other component is identified as a wind which is expanding out of the plane of the galaxy with velocities up to 200 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "these kinematical studies generally assume the disk of ngc  2992 to be oriented with nw edge closest , in concordance with trailing spiral arms . in this orientation ,",
    "with the axis of the bi - cone perpendicular to the disk , the se cone is the closer and is directed towards us , consistent with the outflow interpretation .",
    "if on the other hand the spiral arms lead , then the se edge of the galaxy and the nw cone would be closer . in this orientation the kinematics would indicate inflow instead of outflow .",
    "other possibilities also exist if the bi - cone axis is highly inclined with respect to the galaxy disk .",
    "the x - ray spectral properties of ngc  2992 are described by @xcite ( 1996 ) ( and references therein ) to have a significant absorbing column and a prominent fe k@xmath2 fluorescence emission line .",
    "the x - ray flux varies by a factor of 2@xmath143 on timescales of days to months .",
    "there is an excess of soft x - ray ( 0.1@xmath142.0 kev ) flux above that expected from the extrapolation of the 2@xmath1410 kev power law ( @xmath15=1.7 ) , and there is also some evidence for extended soft x - ray emission on a scale of @xmath52 kpc .",
    "x - ray images of ngc  2992 taken with the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) , and high - resolution imager ( hri ) are presented by @xcite ( 1998 ) . soft x - ray ( 0.2 @xmath14 2.4 kev ) emission extends out to @xmath51  along pa@xmath5100 , and is roughly co - spatial with the 20  cm radio emission .",
    "recently @xcite ( 1997 ) have reported that the near infrared light - curve of ngc  2992 ( monitored @xmath53 times a year over the past 15 years , with an 9  aperture ) shows an outburst in 1988 .",
    "the amplitude of the event was greatest in the l(3.5 @xmath16 m ) band , which increased 102 mjy above the base level in less than 254 days , then decayed exponentially with an e - folding time of @xmath5900 days .",
    "@xcite ( 1997 ) compare the total energy output of the event ( 6@xmath17 j ) to the explosion energies of types i and ii supernovae .",
    "they find that while a conventional un - obscured supernova does not provide a direct fit , the outburst may be explicable in terms of a model similar to that of @xcite ( 1992 ) , which seeks to explain the characteristics of seyfert nuclei in terms of multiple supernova explosions in dense  regions .",
    "this paper presents the results of mapping the enlr of ngc  2992 with long slit spectroscopy in order to investigate the detailed spatial dependence of line ratios and the physical properties with the objective of understanding the mode of excitation of the enlr .",
    "the observations and data reductions are described in section 2 , including the line flux measurements and representative spectra .",
    "three distinct spectral regions of the enlr are identified in section 3 in which we show the spatial variation of the line ratios . in section 4",
    "we derive the physical properties of the emission line gas .",
    "the observations are compared to shock and photoionization model predictions with line ratio diagnostic diagrams in section 5 .",
    "we discuss the @xmath0-test for photoionization from a central source in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we compare the excitation of the gas with the kinematics , and consider the possibility of a thermal pressure energy source for the excitation of the enlr .",
    "ngc  2992 was observed with the double beam spectrograph ( dbs ) on the anu 2.3 m telescope at siding spring , australia on march 5th and 9th 1994 .",
    "loral ccd detectors were used on both the red and blue arms of the spectrograph . the 158 line",
    "mm@xmath7 grating was used in the red arm giving a dispersion of 4.1    pixel@xmath7 , a spectral resolution of 11.9    and covering a wavelength range 5840@xmath149725  .",
    "the 300 line  mm@xmath7 grating was used in the blue arm , providing a dispersion of 2.2   pixel@xmath7 , and yielding a 4.9   spectral resolution over the wavelength range 3440@xmath145570  .",
    "the slit width was fixed at 2  for all observations of ngc  2992 , but was increased to 5  for observations of standard stars so as to ensure that slit losses were negligible .",
    "the spatial scale along the slit was the same in both red and blue arms ; 089 pixel@xmath7 .",
    "spectra were obtained for a total of nine slit positions all orientated at pa 30 .",
    "these were placed @xmath92",
    "apart so as to efficiently cover the enlr and provide a set of spatially independent spectra .",
    "a total of three 1000  s exposures were taken at each slit position .",
    "the fwhm of the standard star profiles along the wide slit provides an estimate of the seeing plus the guiding errors . at the beginning of the first night",
    "the median seeing was @xmath92  but improved to @xmath918 by the end of the night .",
    "the seeing in the middle of the second night was @xmath523 .",
    "data reduction was performed using the standard iraf routines .",
    "pixel to pixel variations in the ccd response were removed by appropriately normalised spectral flat fields derived from quartz - iodine lamp spectra , while a correction for the slit function was made by a low order fit to the illumination of the slit by the twilight sky .",
    "the dbs has very low vignetting , so this correction is not very important .",
    "the wavelength scale was established by fitting 5th order chebychev polynomials to lines identified in helium - argon comparison lamp spectra obtained throughout the observations on both nights .",
    "long - slit observations are usually affected by misalignments and optical distortions which cause the dispersion direction not to be exactly aligned along the lines of the ccd .",
    "spectra of standard stars through a narrow slit revealed this effect to be of order 2.5 pixels over the 1000-pixel length of the ccd , and the arc lines are tilted by approximately 2 pixels .",
    "the distortion in each object and standard star frame was found by tracing the continuum along the dispersion direction .",
    "the distortion in the slit direction was similarly found by tracing the lines in the arc frames .",
    "two dimensional fits to the wavelength and geometrical correction as a function of position was done with the iraf task _ fitcoords_. the two transformations were inverted to map the wavelength as a linear function along lines of the frame , and the position along the slit as a linear function along the columns .",
    "the subtraction of the background sky contribution could then be performed , having first normalised the spectra by fitting a 2nd order polynomial to the background in each column .",
    "all frames were divided by a smoothed spectrum of a featureless dc white dwarf star in order to remove the effects of the dichroic transmission variability , which because of interference effects is a complex oscillatory function of wavelength . the sensitivity function derived from the measured standard stars",
    "can then be fit by a low order polynomial .",
    "the spectrophotometric standards l745 - 46a and w485a were used to calibrate the absolute fluxes of the spectra on the first night , while only l754 - 46a was observed on the second night .",
    "the nights appeared to be photometric , with atmospheric transmission varying less than 10% .",
    "no attempt was made to remove the atmospheric molecular absorption bands .",
    "an error frame was calculated for each 2-dimensional spectrum by taking the square root of the counts after the instrumental corrections and propagating the error through the reductions .    since the observations were made without the aid of an auto - guider , and the slit positions",
    "were set up by offsetting from the nuclear peak of light as it appeared in the tv display , the slit positions were not very accurately controlled .",
    "more accurate slit positions were found by matching the intensity profile of the brightest line in the spectrum [ ]  @xmath15007 to the intensity profile generated from an narrow band image of the galaxy in this same emission line .",
    "this technique involves firstly rotating and binning the image to the same pixel scale and spatial orientation as the 2-d spectra ( 089 pixel@xmath7 , pa 30 ) .",
    "simulated intensity profiles for slits positioned at 03 steps across the enlr were then generated from the image , and were compared to the observed slit profiles .",
    "the best match in each case was found by cross - correlating the observed intensity profile with the set of simulated slit profiles .",
    "the iraf task _ fxcor _ was used in its pixel correlation mode for this purpose .",
    "the correlation function calculated for each simulated slit with the observed profile is a measure of how well the simulated profile matches the observed profile , and gives the relative shift in pixels between the two profiles .",
    "the height of the correlation functions provide three or four best match candidates , which are then inspected manually and a best match chosen . for all but slits -5 and",
    "3 the best match was obvious upon inspection so in general we regard the slit positions as known to within 03 .",
    "the derived slit positions are shown overplotted on the [ ]  @xmath18 image contours in figure  2 . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we refer all spatial positions in the enlr of ngc  2992 to the coordinate system shown in this figure .",
    "the relative and absolute flux calibrations of all slits was assessed by extracting the flux of [ ]  @xmath15007 from the calibrated narrow band image at the @xmath19 coordinates of the spectra and comparing with the line flux measured from the spectra .",
    "the spectra and image fluxes match within 20% at most @xmath19 positions .",
    "one dimensional spectra were extracted from the long slit frames by summing every three pixels along the slit .",
    "the @xmath20 coordinate of the extraction is known from the @xmath20 position of the best match simulated slit , and the @xmath21 coordinates are determined from the relative shift given by the cross - correlation .",
    "this results in a grid of spectra covering the enlr of ngc  2992 with a spacing of approximately 2  in the @xmath20 direction , and closer spacing in the @xmath21 direction . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio in the faint , outer regions of the enlr we have co - added up to 8 spectra into a more coarse grid .",
    "average spectra of the nw cone , se cone and inter - cone regions of the enlr are shown in figures 3a , 3b and 3c .",
    "a sky feature is seen at 6860  and the red end of the spectra are not shown as that region is contaminated with sky features .",
    "the fluxes , wavelengths and widths of the bright emission lines were measured in each grid point spectrum by fitting gaussians to the line profiles with a linear fit to the continuum in the wavelength region of the line .",
    "we find that approximating the continuum as a linear function does not significantly affect the measurement of the bright lines .",
    "the bright emission line measurements were done with the iraf stsdas task @xmath22 .",
    "for the [ ] , [ ] and [ ] doublets the fwhm and wavelength ratio of the lines were fixed in the fitting procedure .",
    "@xmath23 uncertainties in the flux , wavelength and fwhm measurements were calculated from the error spectrum derived from the error frames described above .      at all locations in the enlr",
    "the emission line spectrum is superimposed on an underlying galaxy stellar spectrum .",
    "figure  3b shows that the galaxy contribution is much stronger on the se side of the galaxy .",
    "the main stellar features are readily identified as the ca h and k bands , the g band of c - h at 4290@xmath144313   , h@xmath10 absorption , mg  b at around 5170    and 5890@xmath145896   .",
    "we find that these stellar features and the general shape of the underlying galaxy spectrum can be matched by the spectrum of the e4 peculiar galaxy ngc  1316 ( @xcite 1985 ) with some correction for reddening .",
    "subtraction of the stellar population is very important for the detection and measurement of faint emission lines .",
    "@xcite ( 1996 ) emphasize the importance of subtracting stellar features to obtain accurate measurements of the h@xmath24 , [ ]  @xmath14363 , and  @xmath14686 lines in enlr spectra .",
    "using @xcite ( 1996 ) as a guide for matching the stellar features we have fitted the observed spectra of the nw and se cones , using the ngc  1316 galaxy template to account for the underlying galaxy continuum .",
    "the fit was done over the wavelength range 4200@xmath145300   , with the iraf @xmath22 package . in the fitting procedure",
    "we constrain the redshift of the template to a range close to that determined for the emission lines in the spectrum .",
    "a reddening correction is applied in the fitting procedure using the @xcite ( 1989 ) reddening curve and allowing e(b - v ) to be a free parameter .",
    "the emission lines h@xmath24 , [ ]  @xmath14363 ,  @xmath14686 , h@xmath10 , the [ ]  @xmath124959,5007 doublet and [ ]  @xmath15200 were included in the fit as gaussian components .",
    "the widths of the h@xmath24 and h@xmath10 lines were linked to have the same value in the fit , as were the widths of the [ ]  @xmath124959,5007 doublet lines .",
    "[ ]  @xmath14363 was not linked to the other [ ] lines because the asymmetry observed in the brighter [ ] lines is not seen in the the fainter [ ]  @xmath14363 line .",
    "an error spectrum derived from the original photon statistics of the ccd observations was used in the fitting procedure and allows the calculation of uncertainties in all the fit parameters .",
    "the 1@xmath25 uncertainties in the nw and se cone spectra are approximately 0.15 and 0.4 @xmath26  ergs  s@xmath7  @xmath27  @xmath7 respectively over the wavelength range of the fit .",
    "the nw cone and se cone spectra are both well fit by this procedure , with the template galaxy component matching the wavelengths and depths of the stellar absorption features .",
    "the underlying galaxy spectra in the nw cone required an e(b - v ) of 0.16 and the se cone required an e(b - v ) of 0.17 .",
    "figures 4a and 4b show the result of the fits for the nw and se cones respectively where we show the galaxy template component overplotted on the observed spectra . for each case",
    "we have also subtracted the fitted galaxy template spectrum to reveal the spectrum of the emission line gas .",
    "a small amount of residual structure is seen the spectrum after template subtraction , however this structure is within the 1@xmath28 noise level .",
    "the template subtracted spectrum of the nw cone clearly shows the h@xmath24 , [ ]  @xmath14363 and  @xmath14686 lines . in the se cone h@xmath24 and  @xmath14686 are clearly seen , but [ ]  @xmath14363 is only just above the noise level resulting in a relatively uncertain measurement of the [ ]  @xmath14363 flux for the se cone .",
    "ngc  2992 has a prominent dust lane and the observed spectra show that the reddening varies as a function of position in the enlr , and that the reddening derived from the emission lines is higher than for the underlying galaxy spectrum .",
    "the most severely reddened spectra occur in the regions associated with the dust lane , with the h@xmath2/h@xmath10 ratio observed as high as 10 . for each grid point spectrum",
    "where both h@xmath2 and h@xmath10 are detected we derive a value of the reddening from the h@xmath2/h@xmath10 ratio , using the reddening curve of @xcite ( 1989 ) and assuming an intrinsic h@xmath2/h@xmath10 ratio of 3.1 .",
    "the reddening within the dust lane thus corresponds to a@xmath29=3.6 and decreases outwards along the @xmath20 direction away from the dust lane .",
    "the average reddening values in the nw and se cones are a@xmath29=0.86 and 1.8 respectively . with the orientation of ngc  2992 described in section  1",
    ", we might expect the nw cone , seen through the disk of the galaxy to have the greater reddening .",
    "the disturbed nature of the dust lane may account for this discrepancy .",
    "the emission line measurements for the average spectra of the nw and se cone , and inter - cone regions are given in table 1 along with their reddening corrected values . in each case",
    "the line fluxes are given relative to h@xmath10=100 .",
    "the spectra of the enlr of ngc  2992 are typical of seyfert  2 type galaxies with strong lines of [ ]  @xmath15007 , [ ]  @xmath13727 , h@xmath2 and also the low ionization lines [ ]  @xmath126717,6731 , [ ]  @xmath16583 and [ ]  @xmath16300 .",
    "highly ionized iron lines ( , , ) sometimes seen in seyfert galaxies are not detected in our spectra .",

    "we also detect a blue asymmetry in the line profiles of the [ ]  @xmath124959,5007 lines in the se cone .",
    "the fainter lines of [ ]  @xmath14363 , h@xmath24 and  @xmath14686 are also detected in co - added spectra of the nw and se cones .",
    "a striking feature of this set of spectra is the strong variation of the line ratios as a function of position in the enlr .",
    "figure  5a shows how the [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 and [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 line ratios separate the spectra of the enlr into three groups that correspond to different regions within the enlr .",
    "the open circles indicate spectra extracted from the nw cone of the enlr , the filled squares are for points within the se cone , and the open triangles correspond to spectra extracted from regions between the two cones , and from the outer edges of the two cones .",
    "this effect is shown even more clearly in figure  5b where we have used the ratio of [ ]  @xmath15007 to h@xmath2 instead of h@xmath10 .",
    "using the brighter h@xmath2 line allows us to include spectra down to a fainter brightness limit , thus covering more of the enlr , especially those fainter regions between the cones .",
    "the disadvantage of using the [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath2 ratio is that the reddening correction is greater than the correction to [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 .",
    "this larger reddening correction with its greater uncertainty causes more scatter of the points in figure  5b . for the faintest regions where h@xmath10 is not detected ,",
    "we have applied a value for the reddening which has been extrapolated from adjacent points at which h@xmath10 is measured .",
    "this procedure is most uncertain for the spectra extracted from points between the cones and within the dust lane of the galaxy . for these points",
    "we apply the average reddening of the dust lane points which is equivalent to assuming an h@xmath2/h@xmath10 ratio of 6 before reddening correction . despite these uncertainties in the reddening correction for the [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath2 ratio ,",
    "the inferred spatial variation of the line ratios remains similar to those found in figure  5a .",
    "figure  6 shows the spatial locations of the spectra used in figures 5a and 5b .",
    "we shall maintain the distinction between these three spatial regions by using the same plotting point styles throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "figures 5a and 5b show that the the nw and se cones have significantly different [ ]  @xmath30/h@xmath2 ratios .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath31/h@xmath2 ratio of the average spectrum of the nw cone is 0.46 compared to 0.76 for the se cone .    since the se cone has a stronger underlying galaxy continuum we have investigated the possibility that the variation in [ ]  @xmath30/h@xmath2 between the two cones is due to a greater amount of h@xmath2 absorption in the se cone .",
    "to test this possibility we use the fit to the blue region of the underlying stellar distribution that was discussed in the previous section , and apply it to the spectral range around the h@xmath2 and [ ] lines . in the spectral region around h@xmath2 it is more difficult to make an independent fit for the underlying galaxy continuum .",
    "we therefore fit the galaxy template in the 6450@xmath146700    spectral range using the same multiplicative scale and reddening parameters derived for the blue region .",
    "the h@xmath2 line and each of the [ ]  @xmath126548,6583 emission lines are fitted with single component gaussian profiles with the fit constrained so that the [ ] doublet line wavelengths were at the known ratio . for the fit",
    "the flux ratio [ ]  @xmath16583/@xmath16548 was fixed at 3.0 , and both [ ] components were constrained to have the same line widths .    the results of the fits to the nw cone and se cone and dust - lane region spectra over the 6450@xmath146700    range are shown in figure  7 . in each panel",
    "we show the total fit overlaid on the data and also the result of subtracting the template from the data .",
    "the lighter weight curves in figure  7 show the fitted galaxy template and the individual gaussian component fits to the h@xmath2 and [ ] emission lines .",
    "we obtain an excellent fit to the spectrum in the nw cone .",
    "since the stellar contribution is faint in this cone there is only a small amount of h@xmath2 absorption which is barely discernable in the plot , and is insignificant relative to the emission line fluxes .",
    "the fit to the se cone ( middle panel of figure  7 ) demonstrates that stellar h@xmath2 absorption is more important on the se side of the enlr .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the h@xmath2 flux measurement by @xmath32% and decreases the [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 ratio by @xmath33% compared to the values obtained by using a linear continuum level in the measurement of these lines .",
    "this is not large enough to make a significant difference to the [ ]  @xmath30/h@xmath2 ratio .",
    "we have thus established that the variation of the ratio between the nw and se cones can not be attributed to h@xmath2 absorption , and must therefore be due to real physical differences between the excitation conditions in the cones .",
    "the slight excess shown by the fit at the wavelength of the [ ]  @xmath16548 line is most likely due to a blue asymmetry in the h@xmath2 line similar to the asymmetry in the [ ]  @xmath15007 line seen at the same location .",
    "while it is possible to add another component of h@xmath2 to obtain a better fit to the spectrum , we would also need to include similarly blue shifted [ ] components , and this data simply do not have the resolution or signal to noise required to properly constrain the relative fluxes or line widths of such additional components .",
    "the lower panel of figure  7 shows the fit to the brightest point in the dust - lane region of the enlr . here",
    "h@xmath2 and the [ ]",
    "lines are well fitted by single component gaussians , and yield a [ ] @xmath30/h@xmath2 ratio of 0.59 @xmath34 which is intermediate to the values measured in the nw and se cones .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath14363/ [ ]  @xmath15007 line ratio is the well known temperature diagnostic often referred to as r@xmath35 .",
    "we estimate the temperature from r@xmath35 using the iraf stsdas @xmath36 package which draws on the atomic data of @xcite ( 1983 ) for the o@xmath37 ion . an assumed density of 100 @xmath38 was used in the temperature calculation , and we note that the calculation is relatively insensitive to density .",
    "the average spectrum of the nw cone has r@xmath35=0.019 @xmath39 corresponding to t@xmath13=14780@xmath40 .",
    "the average spectrum of the se cone has r@xmath35=0.025 @xmath41 corresponding to t@xmath13=16990@xmath42 , the greater uncertainties in the se cone are due to the large uncertainty in the [ ]  @xmath14363 measurement .",
    "these temperatures are lower than the value of 19900 k obtained by @xcite ( 1988 ) for the nuclear region .",
    "it is well known that temperature fluctuations in the ionized region tend to drive the value of r@xmath35 up , so the measured temperatures are probably somewhat higher than the mean temperature characterising the o@xmath37 zone .",
    "the ratio of [ ]  @xmath16717/ [ ]  @xmath16731 is a density diagnostic sensitive in the range 100@xmath1410000  @xmath38 .",
    "density estimates from the [ ] ratios were calculated with the iraf stsdas @xmath36 package which draws on the atomic data of @xcite ( 1993 ) for the s@xmath43 ion .",
    "figure  8 shows these densities plotted against the projected radius of the spatial locations within the enlr",
    ". the average error bar on the density measurements is approximately 80 @xmath38 .",
    "we find that the [ ] ratios are close to the lower limit of the diagnostic range , and that some points have [ ] ratios which can only be used as an upper limit for the density .",
    "the central regions have the higher density values .",
    "although figure  8 shows a general trend of decreasing density with distance from the nucleus , the densities in the cones ( when these can be measured ) remain relatively constant with distance .",
    "@xcite ( 1990 ) demonstrated that the [ ] / [ ] line ratio is proportional to the ionization parameter @xmath44 for radiation - bounded photoionized clouds irrespective of the shape of the ionizing continuum .",
    "following @xcite ( 1990 ) we estimate the ionization parameter by the relationship :    @xmath45\\;\\lambda5007\\;/\\;[{\\mathrm o\\;ii}]\\ ; \\lambda 3727\\ ] ]    where we use the reddening corrected ratio of [ ]  @xmath15007 / [ ]  @xmath13727 .",
    "figure  9 shows the values of @xmath44 plotted against the projected radius .",
    "interpreted literally , this shows that the nw cone has slightly higher mean @xmath44 than the se cone , while the dust lane and outer regions of the cone have the lowest ionization parameter .",
    "the utility of line diagnostic diagrams consisting of selected pairs of emission line ratios is well established . with such diagrams ,",
    "different excitation mechanisms can be distinguished , chemical abundances may be estimated ( in special circumstances ) , and physical parameters may be derived .",
    "the most commonly used diagrams involve ratios of bright , easily measured lines ( @xcite 1981 ) , and the best of these restrict the choice of line ratios to emission lines that are close together in wavelength , avoiding the necessity to determine reddening corrections with great accuracy ( @xcite 1987 ) .",
    "our main objective in this section is to analyse the excitation mechanisms responsible for the emission lines .",
    "to do this we compare the observed line ratios with grids of shock and photoionization model predictions .",
    "the models used here are :    * the mappings  ii shock and shock+precursor models of @xcite ( 1996 ) .",
    "these models are parameterised by the shock velocity @xmath46=200@xmath14500 km  s@xmath7 , and the magnetic parameter @xmath47 = 0@xmath144 @xmath16 g  @xmath48 . in these models ,",
    "euv photons produced within the cooling region of the shock , diffuse both upstream and downstream .",
    "those that go downstream are trapped by the shocked gas and produce a low - ionization parameter photoionized region near the point where hydrogen recombines .",
    "the combined spectrum of the cooling and photoionized gas we refer to as the `` shock only '' model .",
    "the ( undoubtedly important ) effect of thermal instabilities are not accounted for in this model .",
    "the photons which pass upstream produce a photoionized region of high ionization parameter and excitation in the pre - shock medium",
    ". the importance of this region depends upon whether this medium is able to absorb the ionizing photons .",
    "shock models which include the contribution of both the shocked gas and its ionized precursor are referred to as `` shock+precursor '' . * the power - law photoionization models presented in @xcite ( 1998 ) .",
    "these are simplified photoionization models calculated with a ionizing spectrum of the form f@xmath49 , with @xmath2=-1 , -1.4 and -2 and a range of ionization parameters ( @xmath50 ) , and densities ( 100@xmath141000 @xmath38 ) .",
    "these models were calculated with the same mappings  ii code as the shock models described above . * the @xmath51 sequence of @xcite ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is a sequence of photoionization models which include both matter bounded and ionization bounded clouds , such that the ionizing spectrum incident on the ionization bounded clouds is filtered by the matter bounded component .",
    "@xcite ( 1996 ) find that this two component model can account for some of the discrepancies of single component photoionization models .",
    "this sequence is parametrised by @xmath51 which is the solid angle ratio of the matter bounded clouds to the ionization bounded clouds .",
    "in plotting the observed points on the resulting line ratio diagrams , we maintain the same plotting point styles as used in section 3 to distinguish between the nw cone ( open circles ) , se cone ( closed squares ) and inter - cone ( open triangles ) regions . in each diagram",
    "we show the average error bar of the observed line ratio , and also provide an arrow indicating the direction of reddening correction .",
    "the shock model grids are labelled with the shock velocity and magnetic parameter . the power - law photoionization @xmath44 sequences are plotted for @xmath52  @xmath38 and @xmath53  @xmath38 with grid lines of constant @xmath44 every 0.25  dex .",
    "the @xmath51 sequence is labelled with @xmath51 and tick marks at intervals of 0.2  dex .      in figures 10 through 16 we show the bright - line diagnostic plots which are generally used for determining excitation conditions in agn .",
    "on these diagrams , we have sufficient observational points to analyse the detailed spatial structure of the ionization cones and the inter - cone region . in all of these diagrams",
    "the line ratios fall within limits that characterise seyfert galaxies , in fact the points from this single object cover almost completely the regions of this diagram filled by samples of seyfert galaxies ( @xcite 1987 ) , indicating that the nlr of ngc  2992 is characterized by a wide range of physical parameters .",
    "this is also reflected in the way that the points fall over a large range of the parameter space covered by the various models .    in section 3",
    "we have already shown how the [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 , and [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath2 versus [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 diagrams separate the nlr of ngc  2992 into 3 distinct spatial regions .",
    "these diagrams are repeated here ( figures 10 and 11 ) with the model grids overlaid .",
    "similar behaviour is clearly shown in other excitation - dependent diagnostic plots such as [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 versus [ ]  @xmath126717,6731/h@xmath2 ( figure  12 ) , or [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 versus [ ]  @xmath13727/ [ ]  @xmath15007 ( figure  13 ) , but is not apparent when the ratios of low - excitation lines with hydrogen are compared , such as the [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 and [ ]  @xmath126717,6731/h@xmath2 line ratios ( figure  14 ) . in these diagrams",
    "the points from the different regions tend to cluster more tightly , and are not clearly separated as they are in figures 10 and 11 .",
    "we will now consider how well the various theoretical sequences match ( or do not match ) the observations .",
    "first , the shock - only grid fails to match any of the observational data , for any of these diagnostic plots .",
    "thus , if the enlr gas is shock - excited , the shocks must be occuring in a matter - rich environment where the euv photons produced by the shocks can be absorbed .",
    "we will not discuss the shock - only grids further .",
    "the shock+precursor grids do much better . in all of the diagrams , with the exception of those which involve ratios of the [ ] lines , such as [ ]  @xmath16300/ [ ]  @xmath15007 ( figure 15 ) , the observations define shock velocities which are reasonably consistent from one diagnostic diagram to another . for example , in figures 10a , 11a and 12a the points from the nw and se cones fall within the high shock velocity region ( 350@xmath14500 km  s@xmath7 ) of the shock+precursor model grid . the inter - cone points show a large range in [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 which extends these points along lines of decreasing shock velocity , down to as low as 200  km  s@xmath7 with approximately constant magnetic parameter in the shock+precursor model grid .",
    "however , the different diagnostic plots do not agree very well as to the value of the magnetic parameter , other than broadly excluding the possibility that this is less than about @xmath54 g  @xmath48 .",
    "however , such scatter as is observed in this parameter between the different diagrams can probably be ascribed to differences between the abundance set used in the models , and those that are applicable to ngc  2992 , as well as to collisional de - excitation effects in the [ ] and [ ] lines , which are not modelled in these ( low density limit ) shock models .",
    "turning now to the simple photoionization models . in each of the diagnostic plots ,",
    "the photoionization models overlap the same region of parameter space in this diagnostic diagram as the shock+precursor models , and so the observed points also fall within the photoionization @xmath44-sequences .",
    "however , different regions tend to be characterized by different ionization parameters and spectral index .",
    "for example , on figure  10b , the nw cone points are within the @xmath55 models with ionization parameter @xmath56 .",
    "the points from the se cone show more scatter , but indicate an average ionization parameter which is lower than in the nw cone .",
    "most of the se cone points fall between the @xmath57 and @xmath58 sequences which may indicate a higher spectral index in the nw cone than in the se cone .",
    "there is however a degree of degeneracy in the photoionization models such that increase in density or an increase in spectral index have a similar effect on the predicted line ratios .",
    "the spread of the inter - cone points may therefore be partially explained by a wider range in density than we computed in the photoionization models . to investigate this possibility we extended the photoionization grid by calculating models with densities down to 10@xmath59 @xmath38 , for ionization parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and spectral index @xmath62 .",
    "the low density limit occurs for density @xmath631.0 @xmath38 , below which [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 remains constant at @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "however , the observed points extend over a wider range down to [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath68 , making it difficult to account for the observations with a photoionization models with a single value of the spectral index @xmath2 such as would be required in a self - consistent photoionization model of the whole nlr .",
    "different diagnostic plots yield different estimates for both @xmath2 and for @xmath44 .",
    "for example , the nw cone points that fall within the @xmath62 @xmath44-sequence in figures 10b and 11b , are shifted closer to the @xmath69 @xmath44-sequences in figure  12b , with a lower value of @xmath44 .",
    "the shift of the points with respect to the photoionization @xmath44-sequences is significant , being approximately 4 times the average 1@xmath25 error bar of the [ ]  @xmath126717,6731/h@xmath2 observations .",
    "for the [ ]  @xmath129069,9532/h@xmath2 versus [ ]  @xmath126717,6731/h@xmath2 plot ( figure  16 ) , @xmath70 is indicated . in general ,",
    "most of the plots are consistent with @xmath71 for the bright parts of the cones , but those involving [ ]  @xmath16583 /h@xmath2 versus [ ]  @xmath126717,6731/h@xmath2 , and [ ]  @xmath129069,9532/h@xmath2 versus [ ]  @xmath126717,6731/h@xmath2 are more consistent with @xmath72 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that not only are the observations inconsistent with a single value of @xmath2 within individual line ratio diagrams , but also that different diagnostic diagrams do not furnish consistent values of @xmath2 between one another . since photoionization models should be characterised by a unique value of @xmath2 determined by the intrinsic nuclear spectrum ( although @xmath44 may change from one region to another ) , these observations provide a serious challenge to photoionization modellers .",
    "by contrast , the shock+precursor models indicate values of the shock velocity which are consistent from one diagram to another ; of order 350@xmath14500 km  s@xmath7 in the cones , falling to as low as 200  km  s@xmath7 in the inter - cone region . in the shock+precursor picture , the apparent changes in both @xmath2 and @xmath44 according to the photoionization interpretation is the result of changes in the spectral energy distribution and the total energy flux in the ionizing radiation as a function of shock velocity .",
    "these problems with photoionization models are not resolved by use of the @xmath51 sequence .",
    "indeed , the fact that @xmath51 sequences are very similar to @xmath44-sequences , when plotted on the traditional line ratio diagrams was shown in @xcite ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is apparent in figures 10b , and 11b where the @xmath51 sequence is very close to the higher density @xmath2=-1.4 @xmath44-sequence .",
    "with respect to the @xmath51 sequence , the observed points from the se and nw cones shown in figures 10b and 11b cluster around the sequence for values of @xmath51 in the range 1@xmath736 .",
    "the se cone points tend to have [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 higher than the @xmath51 sequence prediction , while the nw cone points have [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 slightly lower than the @xmath51 sequence , and favour higher values of @xmath51 . as with the @xmath44-sequences ,",
    "the inter - cone points tend to diverge from the @xmath51 sequence . in general the @xmath51 sequences",
    "can neither explain the range or the direction of scatter of the observations in ngc  2992 .",
    "in addition , in some cases such as in the [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 versus [ ]  @xmath126717,6731/h@xmath2 and the [ ]  @xmath129069,9532/h@xmath2 versus [ ]  @xmath126717,6731/h@xmath2 diagrams ( figures 14 and 16 respectively ) , the @xmath51 sequence is offset from the observations by an amount which is larger than could be explained by abundance variations .",
    "the result of comparing the ratios of the bright lines mapped over the nlr of ngc  2992 can be summarized as follows : the ratios of [ ] , [ ] , [ ] and [ ] generally fall within the parameter space covered by both the shock+precursor , and photoionization @xmath44-sequence models",
    ". the ratios of these lines fall consistently in the same location of the diagnostic diagrams relative to the shock+precursor grid , but do not provide consistency with respect to the photoionization models .",
    "[ ] appears to be slightly overestimated in both shock+precursor and photoionization models , and [ ] is predicted to be too strong in all the models .",
    "the lines of [ ]  @xmath13426 ,  @xmath14686 and [ ]  @xmath14363 also are important diagnostics , but are relatively faint lines so we are not able to spatially map them over the entire enlr of ngc  2992 . in the following three diagrams we compare the model predictions with the observations of these lines in the average spectra of the nw and se cones",
    ".    figure  17 shows [ ]  @xmath126717,6731/h@xmath2 versus  @xmath14686/h@xmath10 . in this diagram",
    "the shock - only and shock+precursor models overlap , so we show the shock - only model grid with dashed lines . it is clear from this diagram that the  @xmath14686/h@xmath10 ratio is underestimated in the shock+precursor models but the photoionization @xmath44-sequence shown in figure  17b can account for the large  @xmath14686/h@xmath10 ratio with @xmath741 and ionization parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the line ratios used in figure  17 are identified by @xcite ( 1996 ) as one of the combinations for which @xmath51 and @xmath44-sequences show markedly different behaviour .",
    "this is apparent in figure  17b where the @xmath51 sequence cuts across the @xmath44-sequences curves .",
    "the data points for the nw and se cones fall relatively close to the @xmath51 sequence for a@xmath761 .",

    "the relative positions of the various grids in this diagram are similar to those figure  17 , and we find that the points fall in similar positions with respect to the @xmath51 sequence and @xmath44-sequences , but fall well off the shock and shock+precursor grids .",

    "this includes the  and [ ] lines as well as higher excitation species such as [ ] .",

    "the a@xmath79 sequence is an example this .",
    "the two components used in the a@xmath79 models can be considered to be a simple approximation of an inhomogeneous medium which may contain regions of different optical thickness to ionizing radiation .",
    "the success of the a@xmath79 sequence in predicting the line ratios as shown in the faint - line diagnostic diagrams may attest to the presence of inhomogeneities in the ionized clouds .",
    "the ionized precursor gas in our shock+precursor models is homogeneous and is thus not expected to reproduce these lines accurately .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite ( 1997 ) has shown that an optically thin , high ionization parameter component which emits high ionization lines , can be produced in the context of more complex shock models associated with shocked entrainment layers at the boundary of ionization cones",
    ".    it may also be possible for combined shock and central source photoionization models to provide a better match to the observed line ratios .",
    "such models are however difficult to constrain and we find no obvious spatial or spectral separation of shock and central source components in our data , so we have not attempted a combined model .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that these diagnostics involving faint high excitation lines will be very useful in developing more sophisticated models of shocks , photoionization or combinations of shocks and central source phtoionization .",
    "a long - standing problem in agn modelling has been the so - called temperature problem . briefly the nature of this problem is that simple photoionization models give low temperatures ( less than 15000  k ) , which disagrees with observations of [ ]  @xmath14363/ [ ]  @xmath15007 in nlrs of some active galaxies , for which the inferred electron temperatures range up to @xmath522000  k ( @xcite 1989 ) .",

    "recently @xcite ( 1996 ) have shown the @xmath51 models can also predict high values of [ ]  @xmath14363/ [ ]  @xmath15007 . also some of the earlier [ ]  @xmath14363 line measurements may be overestimated due to poor subtraction of the underlying galaxy spectrum .",

    "@xcite ( 1996 ) rule out the possibility that this result is due to a projection effect because it would require @xmath88 to increase towards the nucleus , which is inconsistent with the observed sharp edged shape of the cone . @xcite",

    "although photoionizing shocks ( @xcite 1995 ) provide a local source of uv which might explain the rising trend of @xmath90 it is more likely that the apparent increase in @xmath84 is spurious , and is the result of overestimating the average density using the [ ]  @xmath16717/@xmath16731 ratio .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath16717/@xmath16731 ratio is only sensitive as a density diagnostic over the range @xmath5100@xmath1410000 @xmath38 .",

    "if we take the value of @xmath84 as measured near the nucleus where the density is relatively well determined , we find @xmath91 , in units of photons s@xmath7 .",
    "this value is probably reliable , and reflects the true value for the central ionizing source .",
    "using this value of @xmath84 , and the measurements of the ionization parameter and de - projected distances , we rearrange equation  2 to calculate the density required at each location , @xmath92 to keep @xmath84 constant :    @xmath93    the diagrams on the right hand side of figure  22 show the results of this calculation , with @xmath94 plotted against @xmath87 for each of the de - projections .",
    "the dashed line indicates the lower useful limit for the [ ] density diagnostic .",
    "most of the points indicate that @xmath95 is below this limit .",

    "however , if the local density is really as high as 200@xmath14300  @xmath38 in the regions at large @xmath87 where we can measure it , then we would still require shocks if only to produce a local compression .      in this section",
    "we compute the rate of hydrogen recombinations @xmath97 from the h@xmath2 luminosity and compare this to the rate of ionizing photons @xmath84 , derived from the emission line ratios above . in photoionization equilibrium",
    "the rate of hydrogen recombinations must equal the rate of ionizing photons .",
    "the rate of hydrogen recombinations @xmath97 can be derived from the h@xmath2 luminosity by comparing the effective recombination coefficient to produce h@xmath2 photons with the total ( case b ) recombination coefficient for hydrogen :    @xmath98    where l@xmath99 is the h@xmath2 luminosity ( in units of 10@xmath100 ergs  s@xmath7 ) . in the case where a central source is illuminating the nlr :    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the fraction of ionizing photons that are absorbed , and",
    "@xmath103 is the solid angle subtended by the h@xmath2 emitting region as seen from the nucleus .",
    "the reddening corrected h@xmath2 luminosities of the nw and se cones are estimated from our h@xmath2 + [ ] narrow band image , corrected for reddening with a reddening map derived from the grid of h@xmath2/h@xmath10 ratios measured from the spectra .",
    "the reddening map was constructed by re - sampling the semi - regularly spaced grid of reddening constants from the spectra onto the image pixel grid with the idl _ trigrid _ routine .",
    "the h@xmath2 + [ ] flux is summed over the specified region in the reddening corrected image , and a correction applied for the [ ] contribution using the average [ ] /h@xmath2 ratio of the region as measured from the spectra .",
    "this yields the total h@xmath2 flux which is then converted to a luminosity using the distance to ngc  2992 ( 30.8 mpc ) .",
    "for each of the se and nw cones , we have used only the h@xmath2 luminosity of the cones ( corresponding to the same region over which @xmath84 is calculated in the previous section ) and have specified @xmath103= 2.26 steradian , the solid angle of the cone subtended at the nucleus .",
    "the calculation of @xmath97 for the entire nlr region ignores the cone geometry and uses the total h@xmath2 luminosity and @xmath104 .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in these calculations are errors in the reddening correction , and the implicit assumption that @xmath102 is unity .",
    "this means that the @xmath97 values derived represent a lower limit estimate of the number of ionizing photons @xmath84 .",
    "the values of l@xmath105(h@xmath2 ) and @xmath97 computed for the nw and se cones , and the nlr as a whole are shown in table 2 ( [ ] ) calculated from the reddening corrected [ ] narrow band image ] . comparing @xmath97 derived from the h@xmath2 luminosity , and the @xmath84 derived from the forbidden emission line ratios we find that @xmath97 lies within the computed range of the @xmath84 values for all the regions considered .",
    "if the whole region was photoionized by a single central source then we should expect the values of @xmath97 to correspond to the value of @xmath84 as determined for the inner parts of the nlr in the previous section .",
    "however , our lower limits for @xmath97 are however consistently higher than the value of @xmath84 derived at the inner edge of the nlr ( 10@xmath106 photons s@xmath7 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "although the @xmath0-test in its original form is invalid , there does appear to be real evidence for a local source of ionizing photons with a hard spectrum within the cone .",
    "this can only come from photoionizing shocks .",
    "we note that a method along the lines of the @xmath0-test as described here , but devoid of the density diagnostic limitations , to quantify the relative contributions to the ionizing field from local and central sources .",
    "this would aid the development of combined shock and central source photoionization models .",
    "the emission line properties of the enlr of ngc  2992 appear to be understandable in the context of shock excitation of the gas . in this section",
    "we compare the excitation of the gas to the kinematics of the outflow / wind , and also compare the energetics of the radio and x - ray plasma to the emission line gas .",
    "as described in section  1 , the kinematics of the emission line gas shows a outflow velocity field superimposed on the underlying galaxian rotation .",
    "figure  23a shows a map of the the velocity difference of the wind component to the galaxy rotation from our high resolution spectra of the [ ] line . the wind component is systematically blueshifted in the se cone , and redshifted in the nw cone with velocities of up to @xmath5200 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "a map of the fwhm of the wind component shown in figure  23b reveals that the se cone has the broader fwhm , and we consider this to be evidence of greater dynamical activity in the se cone .",
    "if shocks are important for the excitation of the gas , we may expect the kinematical properties of the gas to in some way correlate with excitation . to compare the excitation of the gas with the kinematics we re - binned the high and low resolution spectra onto a common spatial grid covering the enlr , and extracted the emission line ratios , and kinematical properties at each grid point .",
    "we now compare the [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 , and [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 ratios to the kinematics .    in figure  24a",
    "we plot the [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 ratio , which is a measure of the excitation of the gas , versus the fwhm of the kinematical components .",
    "the kinematical component identified with the galaxy rotation are plotted as the solid circles , the main outflow components ( as shown in figure  23 ) are plotted as open squares and where the extra component is detected ( at a few locations ) , this is plotted as open triangles .",
    "the uncertainty in the fwhm is generally less than 100  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the outflow component points show a wide range in fwhm from 100 to 670  km  s@xmath7 , whereas the fwhm of the rotational component is much more quiescent , and is generally less than @xmath5200 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the excitation of the rotational component covers the full range in [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 , while the wind components tend to show higher [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 ratios in locations where the lines are wider .",
    "no regions with line fwhm@xmath107250 km  s@xmath7 display low excitation .",
    "we also compare the data points on the excitation versus line width diagram to the theoretical curves predicted by the shock+precursor models .",
    "the solid curve assumes the fwhm is directly related to the shock velocity , and the dashed curve assumes that the fwhm is associated with the projection of randomly oriented shocks so that @xmath108fwhm/@xmath109 . while the spread of the observed points is very suggestive of shock activity , it is not what would be expected for a simple shock moving into an undisturbed pre - shock medium . in this case , the regions of very high [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 ratio would arise in the precursor , which would be kinematically undisturbed , and therefore there would be an inverse correlation of line width and excitation",
    ". however , if the shocks arise in a mass - entraining flow , the strong shocks are located near the outer boundary of the entrainment flow , and the photoionized precursor medium is the fast - moving material inside this ( @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "this geometry would provide the direct correlation between line width and excitation observed .",
    "in figure  24b we plot the [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 ratio versus the fwhm of the outflow components . as in figure  24a",
    "the square points indicate the main outflow component , and the triangles indicate the extra component . here",
    "we make the distinction between the cones by using filled symbols for the se cone and open symbols for the nw cone .",
    "the cones are clearly separated in figure  24b because the nw cone has lower [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 and lower fwhm , while the more dynamically active se cone has higher [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 .",
    "the shock+precursor curves plotted on figure  24b show that the models predict higher [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 for faster shock velocities .",
    "this suggests that the higher [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 in the se cone is directly related to the greater dynamical activity in that cone .",
    "the difference in shock velocity between the cones inferred from these curves is however greater than that indicated by the [ ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath10 ratio which indicates only slightly faster average shock velocity in the se cone ( see figure  10a ) . as such , the increase in [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 is likely due to a combination of faster shock velocity and increased magnetic parameter , both of which may be expected in the more turbulent conditions within the se cone .",
    "another aspect of shock energetics is related to the question of whether there is sufficient energy in the radio plasma to power the optical emission . for seyferts ,",
    "classical equipartition arguments suggest that the pressure in the relativistic plasma is inadequate to drive high velocity shocks into the interstellar medium and produce the observed emission line flux ( @xcite 1988 ) .",
    "recently @xcite ( 1998 ) have argued that the radio plasma may only trace a fraction of the available energy which exists in an entrained thermal phase , which is not detected in synchrotron emission , and that the nlr may well be powered by the energy and momentum flux originally carried by the radio - emitting jets .    briefly summarising the physics detailed in @xcite ( 1998 ) :",
    "the total energy of a jet - fed lobe is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the jet energy flux , @xmath112 is the age of the lobe and @xmath113 is a factor which accounts for energy lost in adiabatic expansion .",
    "expansion of the lobe gives rise to narrow line emission via shocks and the jet energy flux @xmath111 can be estimated from the [ ]  @xmath15007 luminosity , l([])@xmath114 .",
    "the relativistic electrons in the lobe emit radio wavelength synchrotron radiation , and the ratio of the monochromatic radio power of the lobe ( in synchrotron radiation ) to the jet energy flux can be expressed as :    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the power - law exponent of the electron energy distribution , @xmath117 depends on synchrotron parameters , and @xmath118 is the randomly oriented magnetic field .",
    "@xmath119 is the fraction of the total energy in relativistic electrons and positrons , and is thus a measure of non - thermal to thermal composition of the plasma .",
    "we now use the relationships detailed in @xcite ( 1998 ) to investigate the possibility of a thermal energy source for the enlr of ngc  2992 .",
    "our reddening corrected [ ]  @xmath15007 luminosity gives an estimate of @xmath120  ergs  s@xmath7 , and the 335 mjy flux density detected in the fleurs map of @xcite ( 1980 ) gives a radio power at 1.4 ghz of p@xmath121=3.8 @xmath122  ergs  s@xmath7  hz@xmath7 .",
    "this yields @xmath123  hz@xmath7 , which is typical of seyfert galaxies ( eg . @xcite 1998 ) .",
    "the total pressure can be expressed as : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the total pressure in relativistic electrons @xmath126 plus the pressure in thermal particles @xmath127 .",
    "the minimum pressure magnetic field is obtained by minimising the total pressure subject to the constraint of the observed radio surface brightness .",
    "normally when estimating the pressure in the plasma of radio galaxies via minimum pressure arguments , one takes @xmath128 .",
    "for ngc  2992 , using @xmath129 , an assumed spectral index of 0.7 and an electron index @xmath130 we obtain @xmath131  dyn  @xmath27 , and a minimum pressure magnetic field of @xmath132  g. @xcite ( 1998 ) infer the pressure of the x - ray gas to be @xmath133  dyn  @xmath27 for t=0.1  kev , and @xmath134  dyn  @xmath27 for t=1  kev .",
    "this is larger than the value for @xmath135 obtained in the minimum pressure calculation with @xmath129 , although only marginally so for t=0.1  kev .",
    "therefore it is possible that the conventional estimate of the minimum pressure associated with the non - thermal plasma is an underestimate .",
    "moreover , we note that in order to drive a shock with velocity @xmath136  km  s@xmath7 into gas with a pre - shock number density of @xmath137  @xmath38 , we require a pressure of @xmath138  dyn  @xmath27 .",
    "this is well above the upper x - ray estimate , although the latter is based upon the total extended x - ray luminosity and is therefore an average .",
    "nevertheless the point remains that the pressure of the x - ray emitting gas is possibly well above the conventionally calculated non - thermal value .",
    "therefore we consider values of the parameter @xmath139 .",
    "we find that the thermal pressure , @xmath140 , is equal to upper value for the pressure in the x - ray gas for @xmath141 .",
    "the minimum pressure magnetic field in this case is @xmath142  g. if the lower x - ray pressure is relevant , we obtain values of @xmath143 and @xmath144  g ; that are close to the minimum pressure values for the @xmath129 case .    using these values of @xmath145",
    "we now estimate @xmath119 :    @xmath146^{-1 } = [ 1 + k/2]^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the energy densities of the relativistic and thermal components .",
    "this gives @xmath119=0.026 for @xmath141 , and @xmath119=0.25 for @xmath143 .",
    "these low values of @xmath119 , in particular @xmath119=0.026 , indicate that the relativistic gas which is responsible for the radio emission may constitute only a small fraction of the total energy .    estimating the age to be @xmath149  yrs from the expansion time - scale , and @xmath113",
    ", we obtain @xmath150  yrs for @xmath119=0.026 , and @xmath151  yrs for @xmath119=0.25 . using these values of @xmath152 and the corresponding minimum pressure magnetic fields we can read off @xmath153 from figure  2 in @xcite ( 1998 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath153 in the range @xmath154  hz@xmath7 . these values are larger than the observed value of @xmath153 described above , implying that the energy associated with the radio and x - ray gas is less than the amount required to power the total optical emission of the enlr .",
    "given the uncertainties in the x - ray images and the reddening correction to the [ ]  @xmath15007 luminosity , we may view the results presented here as accurate to an order of magnitude .",
    "even so , this result represents a significant difference compared to the traditional value of @xmath155 which is implicitly used when the radio emission is considered as a scaled down version of a radio galaxy lobe .",
    "another possibility is that minimum pressure conditions are not appropriate . in this case , with @xmath129 , the magnetic field required for the total particle pressure to equal the x - ray gas pressure is @xmath156  g for the upper value of the x - ray gas pressure , and @xmath157  g for the lower value of the x - ray pressure . using the same estimates for @xmath112 and @xmath158 as above leads to estimates of @xmath159  hz@xmath7 for the upper value of the x - ray pressure and @xmath160  hz@xmath7 for the lower value of the x - ray pressure .",
    "the observed value of @xmath153 is outside of these ranges , but only marginally so for the upper value of the x - ray pressure .    in the context of the theoretical work of @xcite ( 1998 )",
    "the properties of the optical , radio and x - ray emitting gas in ngc  2992 indicate that the energy associated with the radio plasma and the x - ray emitting gas may provide a larger fraction of the energy required to power the enlr than anticipated by previous calculations for seyferts which assume @xmath161 .",
    "the uncertainties in the above calculations could be reduced if an accurate estimate of the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas was available .",
    "the physical properties of ngc  2992 derived from the emission line spectra show that the enlr is characterized by relatively high temperature , [ ] densities up to 400 @xmath38 and a fairly wide range of excitation .    in comparing the",
    "spatially mapped line ratios with an extensive shock and photoionization model grids , we have shown that the observations generally fall within the parameter space defined by either class of model . however , in terms of the consistency of the model predictions from one diagnostic diagram to another , the shock+precursor models provide a better outcome .",
    "the ionization cones are characterised by a shock velocity of 350@xmath14500  km  s@xmath7 , consistent with the line widths found in high resolution observations . in the inter - cone region , and about the edges of the ionization cones , the velocities inferred are lower , ranging down to about 200 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "single component photoionization models would require a range of spectral indices in the different regions , which is not allowed in a model where the photons are provided by a central source .",
    "in addition , different line ratios demand different values of the ionization parameter in the same region , which is again inconsistent .",
    "the two component @xmath51 sequence model of @xcite ( 1996 ) is generally better able to account for the observed line ratios than the simple single component photoionization models .",
    "indeed , the fit provided by both the shock and photoionization hypotheses , in particular for the higher ionization lines , would be improved by more sophisticated multi - component models .",
    "we have applied the @xmath0-test for a central ionizing source and have shown that the apparent increase in the rate of ionizing photons , @xmath0 , with distance from the nucleus is most likely due to overestimation of the average density with the [ ]  @xmath16717/@xmath16731 ratio .",
    "the most reliable values of @xmath0 determined at the inner edge of the nlr , are however below the lower limits for the hydrogen recombination rate @xmath97 suggesting that there is a source of locally produced ionizing photons which may be attributed to the ionizing field generated by fast shocks .    despite the lack of any direct morphological indication of interaction between the radio or x - ray plasma with the emission line gas in ngc  2992 , shocks must play an important role in this object .",
    "the outflow kinematics attest to this , because strong shocks with mach numbers of order 40 simply must occur in such dynamically active gas .",
    "furthermore , the observation of co - spatial x - ray and radio emitting plasma support the entrainment theory of @xcite ( 1998 ) in which the seyfert jets are dominated by the entrained thermal plasma . in this object",
    "we find that the energy associated with the radio and x - ray plasma may account for a large fraction of the energy required to power the total optical emission of the enlr .    while the emission line ratios alone can not uniquely determine shocks as the dominant excitation mechanism , the observed ratios and the velocity field and the kinematical line widths are all broadly consistent with shocks , and with the energetics as determined from the radio and x - ray plasma .",
    "we find no spectral evidence for significant contribution to the ionizing field or outflow from a starburst component , and favour the interpretation of @xcite ( 1998 ) that the source of the outflow is an initially relativistic jet originating at the agn .",

    "<S> this paper presents long slit spectral maps of the bi - cone shaped extended narrow line region ( enlr ) in the seyfert galaxy ngc  2992 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the physical properties of the enlr via emission line diagnostics , and compare the observations to shock and photoionization models for the excitation mechanism of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> the line ratios vary as a function of position in the enlr , and the loci of the observed points on line ratio diagrams are shown to be most consistent with shock+precursor model grids . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the energetics of a nuclear ionizing source for the enlr , and perform the @xmath0-test in which the rate of ionizing photons from the nucleus is inferred from measurements of the density and ionization parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-test is shown to be invalid in the case of ngc  2992 because of the limitations of the  density diagnostic . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation of the gas is shown to be broadly consistent with the kinematics , with higher [ ]  @xmath16583/h@xmath2 present in the more dynamically active region . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the pressure associated with the x - ray emitting plasma may provide a large fraction of the pressure required to power the enlr via shocks . </S>"
