    "recent observations with high spatial resolution and polarimetric sensitivity revealed that quiet photospheric regions contain a large amount of horizontal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the size of the horizontal field patches varies from less than one to a few arcsec @xcite .",
    "those with sizes comparable to the average size of the granular pattern are very dynamic @xcite .",
    "such horizontal internetwork fields ( hif ) appear in internetwork as well as in plage regions with no significant difference in the rate of occurrence .",
    "their lifetimes range from a minute to about ten minutes , comparable to the lifetime of granules .",
    "some of them are recognized to be loop - like structures emerging cospatially with granules .",
    "they appear first inside the granule , then move to the intergranular lanes where they disappear @xcite . around @xmath6 of such loop - like",
    "features rise and thus may contribute to the heating of higher atmospheric layers @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some hif are associated with downflows @xcite .",
    "mhd simulations show that horizontal magnetic field may appear during flux cancellations @xcite or flux emergence over single or multiple granules @xcite .",
    "additionally , a significant amount of small - scale horizontal field is possibly produced through local dynamo action @xcite . to estimate",
    "what fraction of hif has its origin in each of these processes could , however , be challenging since their observable signature may be similar .",
    "previous studies of hif were based on slit observations of selected features that appear as single events , mostly associated with upflows .",
    "here we use the first imaging observations obtained with the imaging magnetograph experiment ( imax , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard sunrise , a balloon - borne solar observatory @xcite , to obtain statistical properties of hif . mounted on a 1-m aperture telescope ,",
    "imax provides two - dimensional maps of the vector magnetic field with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution . using these data , we study all structures that show significant linear polarization signal in the selected quiet sun time series . we examine their properties , in particular their connection with the velocity field .",
    "we use two data sets obtained on june 9 2009 , 00:36:02 - 00:58:46  ut ( data set 1 ) and 01:30:54 - 02:02:29  ut ( data set 2 ) .",
    "the fov covers @xmath7 of a quiet region at disk center .",
    "polarization maps were taken in 5 wavelength positions over the fe  i  525.02  nm line with a cadence of @xmath8  s and a pixel size of @xmath9 .",
    "after data reduction @xcite , two types of data are produced : non - reconstructed ( level 1 ) and data reconstructed using phase - diversity information ( level 2 ) , reaching a spatial resolution of 0.15 - 0.18 arcsec .",
    "all data are corrected for instrumental effects , including intensity fluctuations due to interference fringes , dust particles , and illumination effects , as well as jitter - introduced polarization cross - talk , and blueshift over the fov due to the collimated setup of the magnetograph etalon .",
    "the noise level of the non - reconstructed stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 data is @xmath12 .",
    "the reconstruction process amplifies the power of all spatial frequencies and , therefore , also increases the noise level by a factor of 2.5 - 3 .",
    "although the polarization signals are also amplified by the reconstruction , a significant amount is , nevertheless , lost in the noise .",
    "thus , to identify the hif we use the non - reconstructed linear polarization signal averaged over the 4 wavelength positions in the spectral line ( * ? ? ?",
    "15 ) . to reduce the noise",
    "additionally , we applied the gaussian filter with fwhm of 2 pixels ( @xmath13 ) to the linear polarization maps prior to the hif identification .",
    "to obtain statistical properties of a large number of features with significant linear polarization signal , we use a modified version of the mlt ( multi level tracking ) algorithm of @xcite as an automatic detection method .",
    "mlt applies a sequence of thresholds with decreasing values to the mean linear polarization map .",
    "the algorithm identifies features when they show the largest signal and expands them in three dimensions ( two spatial and one temporal ) as the threshold value is decreased . after extensive tests we chose to use 13 thresholds ranging from @xmath14 to a final threshold of @xmath15 . to avoid artificial splitting of structures with several intensity peaks we set an additional criterion .",
    "if two features were separate for threshold @xmath16 and their maximum intensity does not exceed the @xmath17th threshold value by more than @xmath18% , we let them merge @xcite .",
    "as an example , fig .",

    "the detected hif have a wide range of sizes and appear to be organized on mesogranular scales .    ) .",
    "overplotted contours mark the position of the features identified with mlt .",
    "the observations were obtained at the times given in the top panels ( in ut ) .",
    "the hif evolution during its whole lifetime ( 00:36 - 00:40  ut ) is shown in the movie provided as online material .",
    "[ fig : ex1],scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the total number of features that are followed in time and space from their appearance to their disappearance is 4536 ( 1911 in data set 1 and 2625 in data set 2 ) .",
    "taking into account that the features are detected during 22  min ( data set 1 ) and 31  min ( data set 2 ) in a fov of @xmath7 , we obtain a rate of occurrence of @xmath19  s@xmath1  arcsec@xmath2 ( data set 1 ) and @xmath20  s@xmath1  arcsec@xmath2 ( data set 2 ) .",
    "this is of 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than the values reported in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the detected features occupy @xmath21% of the image area .",
    "the distributions of lifetime and maximum area of the detected features are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : basics]a , b , respectively . since the duration of the observations is comparable to the lifetimes of longer - lived features , we tend to underestimate their number .",
    "therefore , we correct the lifetime distribution by multiplying with a weight of @xmath22 for structures that live @xmath23 frames , where @xmath24 is the total number of frames . owing to the limited spatial resolution and the finite time cadence of our observations , both distributions ( lifetime and maximum area ) show peaks at small values .",
    "both distribution also have the extended tails that can be fitted with exponentials .",
    "this implies that the features do not have a characteristic lifetime or size .",
    "their lifetimes range from @xmath2533  s ( features that appear in only one frame ) to @xmath26  min , with @xmath2740% of the features living less than @xmath28  s. the area distribution has a peak at 0.1  arcsec@xmath29 , with @xmath2712% of the features being smaller than that . around @xmath30% of the features are smaller than @xmath31  arcsec@xmath29 , which was given as the mean hif size in previous studies @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : basics]c and d show scatter plots of maximum area and maximum linear polarization signal versus feature lifetime . figure  [ fig : basics]d has a cutoff at @xmath32% , which is the lowest threshold value taken for mlt segmentation .",
    "the curves connect binned values for @xmath33 points each .",
    "the plots indicate that longer - lasting features tend to be larger , and to display a higher mean linear polarization signal .",
    "the largest feature has a lifetime of @xmath34  min and occupies up to @xmath35  arcsec@xmath29 in the course of its evolution .",
    "its mean linear polarization signal reaches @xmath36% .    in order to study whether the features are located in preferred locations with respect to the granular pattern , we follow the method of @xcite .",
    "unsharp - masked continuum images are obtained by subtracting , from the originals , the images smoothed with a 59 pixel wide ( 3.2@xmath37 ) boxcar function . in this way , intensity variations on scales larger than granulation ( due to , e.g. , p - mode oscillations ) are suppressed .",
    "the pixels are then sorted into 250 equally populated intensity bins , ranging from dark intergranuar lanes to bright granular centers . the fractional area occupied by the hif",
    "is calculated for each bin .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : basics]e .",
    "the solid line represents unsharp - masked continuum values ( see y - axis on the left ) .",
    "the right y - axis shows the range of fractional areas occupied by the hif in each bin .",
    "the distribution is similar to the results shown by ( * ? ? ?",
    "it has a peak of 3.5% at positive values of the unsharp - masked intensity distribution .",
    "this suggests , as @xcite noticed , that hif tend to be located at intermediate intensities , presumably at the periphery of granules .    . the hif evolution during its whole lifetime ( 01:49 - 01:55  ut ) is shown in the movie provided as online material .",
    "[ fig : ex2],scaledwidth=50.0% ]      to estimate which percentage of the features are emerging or submerging , we study the distribution of the associated line of sight ( los ) velocities .",
    "the los velocities are derived from gaussian fits to the non - reconstructed stokes  @xmath38 profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : basics]f shows the fractional area of the detected features associated with upflows .",
    "the distribution shows that the majority of features have a large area fraction associated with upflows .",
    "however , most of the features also have part of their area associated with downflows .",
    "only @xmath2716% of the features are fully embedded in upflows .",
    "the features fully embedded in downflows make up @xmath278% of the total number of the detected features .",
    "figures  [ fig : basics]g and  [ fig : basics]h show hif lifetimes versus the minimum and maximum velocities , respectively , associated with the hif during their lifetimes .",
    "positive velocities correspond to downflows .",
    "the plots confirm that most features are assocciated with both up- and downflows .",
    "moreover , the hif tend to sample strong upflows and less strong downflows .",
    "this implies that the linear polarization signal tends to disappear before or when plasma overturns at granule edges .",
    "only @xmath39% of the hif show the stronger ( @xmath40  km / s ) downflows in intergranular lanes .",
    "features that are fully embedded in upflows ( v@xmath41 ) or downflows ( v@xmath42 ) during their whole lifetime tend to be shortlived .",
    "they are also small in size ( @xmath43  arcsec@xmath29 for the former and @xmath44  arcsec@xmath29 for the latter ) .    since emerging horizontal features",
    "have been studied in some detail by other authors @xcite , we consider here two examples of features associated with downflows . figures  [ fig : ex1 ] and  [ fig : ex2 ] show the intensity pattern and los velocity together with the mean linear and circular polarization signals at two time instances : before and during the hif lifetime .",
    "overplotted contours mark the position of features detected with mlt . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex1 ] , the continuum images show a granule at [ 4@xmath37 ,  2.5@xmath37 ] which is fragmenting along two dark lanes . in the course of the fragmentation , one downflow lane develops while another , already existing , intergranular lane broadens .",
    "adjacent to the granule , at the junction of the lanes being formed , a patch of stronger linear polarization signal appears at [ 2.5@xmath37 ,  3@xmath37 ] .",
    "it disappears after @xmath46  min , when the fragmentation process finishes .",
    "the circular polarization maps show a dominant negative polarity patch at this location .",
    "a small positive patch is also visible @xmath47 away from the hif ( at [ 3.5@xmath37 ,  3@xmath37 ] ) , at the beginning of the hif evolution . towards the end ,",
    "the magnetic concentration of negative polarity also becomes weaker .",
    "figure  [ fig : ex2 ] presents a similar case .",
    "the granule at [ 4@xmath37 ,  2@xmath37 ] is fragmenting followed by the appearance of a strong downflow at the same location .",
    "linear polarization maps show a hif appearing in the intergranular lane , at [ 3@xmath37 ,  2@xmath37 ] , growing with time and then disappearing at the same location . during the same period , two adjacent patches of opposite polarity",
    "are visible in the circular polarization maps .",
    "the positive polarity patch increases in size , while the negative becomes weaker at the location of the downflow ( at [ 3@xmath37 ,  1@xmath37 ] ) .",
    "the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex2 ] belongs to @xmath2753% of the detected features that have circular polarization signal ( cp ) of both polarities associated with them .",
    "the features that are associated with only one polarity ( as the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex1 ] ) make up @xmath2742% of the total number of the detected features .",
    "the rest of the hif has no cp higher than @xmath48 ( @xmath49% ) in their vicinity ( in the region of @xmath50  pixels around them ) .",
    "if we consider only features that are fully embedded in downflows , then @xmath2760% of them are associated with only one polarity and @xmath2731% is associated with cp of both polarities .",
    "considering results from mhd simulations , we can think of two possible scenarios for horizontal fields associated with downflows . in the first",
    ", a magnetic loop is submerged by a downflow @xcite . in the second scenario ,",
    "the field is organized in small loop - like structures and forms bundles which , observed with limited spatial resolution , appear as patches of higher linear polarization signal located in downflow lanes @xcite . as flux",
    "is being redistributed owing to the granular evolution , the bundles are dispersed and the spatial smearing of more isolated loop - like structures reduces the linear polarization signal to values below the noise level .",
    "based on sunrise / imax data and using an automated detection method , we obtained statistical properties of 4536 features with significant linear polarization signal .",
    "their lifetimes are consistent with examples given previously in the literature .",
    "however , the lifetime distribution indicates no characteristic value , in contrast to previous studies @xcite .",
    "the detected features have no characteristic size either . around @xmath30% of them are smaller than @xmath271  arcsec@xmath29 , which is the value previously taken as the mean size of hif @xcite .",
    "we find that their rate of occurrence is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than reported earlier @xcite .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to selection effects .",
    "if we take only the biggest features ( sizes @xmath51  arcsec@xmath29 ) , only @xmath274% of the detected features remain and the rate of occurrence decreases to @xmath52  s@xmath1  arcsec@xmath2 , which is in closer agreement with the references cited above .",
    "longer - lived hif tend to be larger and display a higher mean linear polarization signals .",
    "the hif appear preferentially at the granule boundaries , with most of them being caught by downflows at some point in their evolution .",
    "we showed that @xmath2716% of the features we detected are completely embedded in upflows and @xmath278% are entirely embedded in downflows .",
    "the latter are very small in size ( as illustrated by the two examples discussed in greater detail ) .",
    "although their origin is still uncertain it is clear that they do not fit into the scenario of magnetic flux emergence as their physical cause .",
