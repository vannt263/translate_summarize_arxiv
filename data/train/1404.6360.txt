    "collective opinion formation in society seems to be an emerging phenomenon that occurs in networks of agents that interact and exchange opinions .",
    "the voter model is an individual - based stochastic model for collective opinion formation that has been studied in , above all , statistical physics and probability theory communities for decades @xcite .    in the voter model ,",
    "a node assumes one of the different states ( i.e. , opinions ) that can stochastically change over time .",
    "the configuration in which all nodes take the same state , i.e. , consensus , is the only type of absorbing configuration of the voter model .",
    "the mean time to consensus , which we denote by @xmath2 , is a fundamental property of the voter model . for a given size of the population ,",
    "@xmath2 depends on the network structure , which suggests that opinions spread faster on some networks than others .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath2 is small for well - connected networks such as the complete graph for which @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the number of nodes in the network @xcite .",
    "more complex networks with small mean path lengths also yield linear or sublinear dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath2 can be large for networks in which communication between nodes is difficult for topological reasons . for example , the one - dimensional chain yields @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "networks with community structure also yield @xmath4 when intercommunity links are rare @xcite because coordination between the different communities is a bottleneck of the entire process .    in this study , we explore network structure that maximizes the consensus time . in practice , answering this question may help us understand why consensus is difficult in real society @xcite . in theory , we expect that there exist networks for which @xmath2 is larger than @xmath5 for the following reason .",
    "the mean consensus time of the voter model is often analyzed through the random walk .",
    "in fact , the so - called coalescence random walk is the dual process of the voter model , implying that the mean time before random walkers coalesce into one gives @xmath2 for the voter model @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the voter model on the chain , positions of active links , i.e. , boundaries between adjacent nodes possessing the opposite states , perform a random walk until different active links meet and annihilate .",
    "this relationship helps us to calculate @xmath2 for the chain [ i.e. , @xmath4 ] through the hitting or cover time of the random walk .",
    "because the hitting time @xcite and cover time @xcite of the random walk are known to scale as @xmath0 for some networks , @xmath2 of the voter model may also scale as @xmath0 for these and other networks .    in networks in which the degree ( i.e. , number of neighboring nodes for a node ) is heterogeneous ,",
    "the consensus time depends on the specific rule with which we update the state of nodes @xcite .",

    "<S> we explore the networks that yield the largest mean consensus time of voter models under different update rules . by analytical and numerical means , we show that the so - called lollipop graph , barbell graph , and double - star graph maximize the mean consensus time under the update rules called the link dynamics , voter model , and invasion process , respectively . for each update rule , the largest mean consensus time scales as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of nodes in the network . </S>"
