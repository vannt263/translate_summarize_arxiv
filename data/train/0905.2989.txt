    "the transitional phase , that links the blue and red galaxy states , is reflected in a sparsely populated region in color - magnitude diagrams that is referred to as the ` green valley ' . on the other hand ,",
    "past cosmological models have been unsuccessful in describing the formation of massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have led to systematic over - predictions of the number of both massive blue , and the most massive red galaxies in the universe .",
    "only recently have these problems been overcome by implementing ` agn feedback ' in the models @xcite .",
    "two types of agn feedback are often invoked .",
    "the first is known as the ` quasar ' or ` truncation ' mode . in this mode",
    "quasar winds are thought to quench star formation , and cause galaxies to fade to red colors by expelling a fraction of the gas from the galaxy .",
    "the second , often referred to as ` radio ' or maintenance mode is linked to radio agn outflows in already massive , red galaxies .",
    "these outflows are thought to heat the surrounding medium , and thereby prevent further star formation in the galaxy and hence limit growth from creating overly high mass galaxies .",
    "although observational evidence supporting agn feedback is growing @xcite , its impact on galaxy formation and evolution is still poorly understood . here",
    "we focus on studying the link between radio agn activity and massive galaxy formation",
    ".    studies of radio agn suggest that powerful (  @xmath2  ) and weak (  @xmath3  ) radio agn represent different galaxy populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". based on a sample of local radio agn , @xcite have shown that those with strong emission lines of high - ionization potential species are predominantly powerful in radio .",
    "as has been suggested in a model developed by @xcite this high / low excitation classification may represent a principal separator between populations fundamentally different in their black hole accretion mechanisms ( see also @xcite ) . in this model , central super - massive black holes of high - excitation radio agn ( heragn hereafter ) accrete in a standard ( radiatively efficient ) way from the cold phase of the intra - galactic medium ( igm ) , while those of low - excitation radio agn ( leragn hereafter ) are powered in a radiatively inefficient manner by bondi accretion of the hot igm .",
    "although still awaiting a robust confirmation , this model successfully explains many observed properties of radio agn .",
    "recently , @xcite have used a unique sample of weak ( vla - cosmos ; @xcite ) radio agn , that reaches out to @xmath4 , to study their host galaxies , and cosmic evolution .",
    "they find that , i ) already at @xmath5 , weak radio agn occur in red - sequence galaxies with the highest stellar and black hole masses , and ii ) contrary to powerful radio agn , the volume - averaged number - density of weak radio agn evolves only modestly with cosmic time ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "based on these results , they have proposed an evolutionary scenario in which powerful ( predominantly high - excitation ) and weak ( predominantly low - excitation ) radio agn represent different ( i.e.  earlier and later , resp . )",
    "stages of the blue - to - red galaxy evolution .",
    "this scenario suggests that the triggering of radio agn activity is a strong function of host galaxy properties , linked to different stages of massive galaxy formation .",
    "it also illuminates the mechanisms of ` agn feedback ' , regularly invoked in cosmological models , as it suggests that powerful and weak radio agn activities are bound to different types of feedback .",
    "the main goal of this letter is to test the above outlined models and scenarios . to do this",
    "we utilize a large local sample of radio agn ( ) , in which accurate low / high excitation classifications can be obtained . in",
    "we explore the fundamental differences between these types of radio agn , and we put them into a perspective of massive galaxy build - up in .",
    "in order to investigate the principal differences between various radio agn types , we make use of a unified catalog of radio objects detected by nvss , first , wenss , gb6 , and sdss @xcite .",
    "we have augmented this catalog with derivations of emission line fluxes , 4000  breaks , stellar masses , and stellar velocity dispersions , drawn from the sdss - dr4 ` main ' spectroscopic sample ( see @xcite and reference therein)lines@xmath6v5.0@xmath64.fit ) , and stellar mass , dn(4000 ) , and stellar velocity dispersions ( agn.dat@xmath6dr4@xmath6release.v2 ) have been downloaded from www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr4/ ] .",

    "in order to access the most accurate emission line flux estimates we restrict the above defined sample of unique objects in redshift to @xmath0 , and select only sources with stellar mass , and 4000  break measures luminosity estimates . ] . we define emission - line galaxies as those where the relevant emission lines ( h@xmath8 , h@xmath9 , o[iii,@xmath105007 ] , n[ii,@xmath106584 ] ) have been detected at @xmath11 , and consider all galaxies with @xmath12 in these lines as absorption line systems . given that the latter are luminous at 20  cm , they can be considered to be ( low excitation ) agn ( see e.g.  @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "further , using standard optical spectroscopic diagnostics @xcite we sort the emission - line galaxies into 1 ) star forming , 2 ) composite , 3 ) seyfert , and 4 ) liner galaxies ( see ) .",
    "the last two classes have been selected by requiring @xmath11 in s[ii,@xmath10@xmath106717,6731 ] and [ oi , @xmath13 , as well as ` unambiguously ' by imposing combined criteria using 3 emission line flux ratios ( see middle and right panels in ) .",
    "the spectroscopic selection yields final samples of @xmath14 star forming galaxies and @xmath15 agn , out of which @xmath16 are ` unambiguous ' seyferts , @xmath17 are ` unambiguous ' liners , and @xmath18 are absorption line systems .",
    "hereafter , we will separately analyze the properties of absorption line agn , liners , and seyferts , keeping in mind that the first two are low - excitation systems , while the last has luminous and hard uv sources which ionize the observed emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the full range of 20  cm radio power ) , and assuming a spectral index of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) ] in these samples is @xmath21  .",
    "in , we show the distributions of color , 4000  break strength [ @xmath22 and stellar mass for the host galaxies of radio luminous agn , spectroscopically divided into seyfert , liner , and absorption line galaxies . while liner and absorption line systems follow very similar distributions ( as expected if low - excitation systems form one family ) , there are obvious differences compared to seyfert galaxies .",
    "the former on average have redder optical @xmath23 colors ( left panel in ) , larger values of @xmath24 ( implying older stellar populations ; middle panel ) , and higher stellar masses ( left panel ) . from these plots",
    "it is obvious that seyfert galaxies represent a population with properties in an intermediate range , linking those of star forming galaxies at one extreme to those of massive red galaxies at the other .",
    "in particular , seyfert galaxies in the first - nvss - sdss sample are consistent with ` green valley ' objects , a population thought to be in transition from star formation dominated- to a ` red - and - dead'- state ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we will discuss this further in .    in order to investigate",
    "the central super - massive black hole properties of radio agn , in  we show the distribution of stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath25 ) , and the ratio of o[iii ] luminosity and @xmath26 for the liners and seyferts in the first - nvss - sdss sample . as black hole mass",
    "is tightly correlated with the bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath27 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath28 is a proxy for black hole mass .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath29}$ ] traces well the agn bolometric luminosity ( see @xcite for details ) , the quantity @xmath29}/\\sigma^4 $ ] is proportional to the mass accretion rate onto the black hole ( in eddington units ; @xmath30 ) .  shows that radio luminous liners have systematically higher black hole masses , and lower accretion rates ( in eddington units ) than radio luminous seyferts .",
    "this is consistent with the overall properties of liner and seyfert galaxies @xcite , and in support of the radio agn scenario developed by @xcite , and based on the results presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e06 hereafter ) .    using high resolution x - ray imaging of radio cores in a sample of 22 3crr ( @xmath31 ) radio galaxies ,",
    "e06 have studied accretion rates in various types of radio agn .",
    "they have found that x - ray cores of usually powerful , edge brightened ( fr  ii ) radio galaxies are dominated by absorbed , accretion related emission .",
    "contrary to this , they find that x - ray cores of typically weak , core dominated ( fr  i ) radio galaxies likely arise from a jet , and any additional accretion - related components in these have low radiative efficiencies .",
    "based on these results , @xcite have assumed that it is the excitation state ( rather than radio morphology ) that is the principal separator of the black - hole accretion mechanism in radio agn .",
    "recently , high - quality optical spectroscopy , that allows a robust high / low excitation classification of the e06 sample , has become available .",
    "@xcite have computed emission line fluxes for a large number of radio agn , including most of the galaxies in the e06 sample .",
    "thus , it is now possible to view the e06 sample robustly separated into low - excitation ( liner ) and high - excitation ( seyfert ) state systems . in  we have overplotted the 3crr galaxies studied in e06 with available spectroscopic line measurements .",
    "the properties of this sample are summarized in",
    ".  clearly shows that the 3crr radio galaxies independently classified as radiatively inefficient accretors ( e06 ) are liners , while those identified as accreting efficiently are seyferts ( see also last column in ) .",
    "only two galaxies ( 3c  31 , and 3c  449 ) are classified here as seyferts , yet they have been identified as radiativelly inefficient accretors by e06 . however , as evident from  their black hole accretion efficiencies may also be consistent with radiativelly efficient accretion .",
    "overall , the black hole masses of the 3crr liner galaxies ( @xmath32  ) are systematically higher than those of 3crr seyferts ( @xmath33  ) , consistent with the black hole properties of first - nvss - sdss liners and seyferts .",
