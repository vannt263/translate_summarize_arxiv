    "thereby , the impurity quadrupoles were overcompensated by the conduction electrons , leading to the residual entropy of ( 0.5)@xmath14ln2 and the nfl behavior : the magnetic susceptibility @xmath15 and the specific heat divided by temperature , @xmath16 , show ln@xmath3 dependence , and the electrical resistivity follows @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is residual resistivity and @xmath19 is a coefficient.@xcite nfl state and the residual entropy were also expected in a quadrupole kondo ` lattice ' , in which quadrupole moments are periodically placed.@xcite very recently , the peculiar temperature dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath20 have been theoretically predicted.@xcite moreover , in the lattice model , new types of electronic ordered states have been proposed.@xcite nevertheless , there is no experimental evidence on the exotic states , probably because there are rare systems carrying purely active quadrupoles .    over the past few decades ,",

    "<S> this is the first observation of the nfl state in the nonmagnetic quadrupole - active system , whose origin is intrinsically different from that observed in the vicinity of the conventional quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> it implies possible formation of a quadrupole kondo lattice resulting from hybridization between the quadrupoles and the conduction electrons with an energy scale of @xmath10 . at @xmath110.13 </S>",
    "<S> k , @xmath7 and @xmath8 exhibit anomalies as @xmath5 approaches 5 t. this is the manifestation of a field - induced crossover toward a fermi - liquid ground state in the quadrupole kondo lattice . </S>"
