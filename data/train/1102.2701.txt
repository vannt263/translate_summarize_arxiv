    "the @xmath0-index has been introduced by hirsch ( 2005 ) as a research performance indicator for individual scholars .",
    "the @xmath0-index is designed as a single score , balancing the two most important dimensions of research activity , _",
    "i.e. _ the productivity of a scholar and the corresponding impact on the scientific community . indeed , according to the original definition of the empirical @xmath0-index provided by hirsch ( 2005 ) , `` a scientist has index @xmath0 , if @xmath0 of his or her @xmath1 papers have at least @xmath0 citations each , whereas the other @xmath2 papers have no more than @xmath0 citations each '' .",
    "notwithstanding that the @xmath0-index has been only recently proposed , it is increasingly being adopted for evaluation and comparison purposes to provide information for funding and tenure decisions , since it is considered an appropriate tool for identifying `` good '' scientists ( ball , 2007 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", several reasons explain its popularity and diffusion ( costas and bordons , 2007 ) .",
    "as it is apparent from its definition , the @xmath0-index displays a simple structure allowing easy computation , using data from web of science , scopus or google scholar , while it is robust to publications with a large or small number of citations .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-index may be adopted for assessing the research performance of more complex structures , such as journals ( setting up as a competitor of the impact factor , see _",
    "e.g. _ braun _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) , groups of scholars , departments and institutions ( molinari and molinari , 2008 ) and even countries ( nejati and hosseini jenab , 2010 ) .    quite obviously",
    ", the @xmath0-index has received considerable attention by researchers in the fields of scientometrics and information science ( van noorden , 2010 ) .",
    "even if the hirsch index was originally introduced in a descriptive framework , scientometricians often aim to assume a statistical model for citation distribution and the interest is focused on the empirical @xmath0-index ( see _ e.g. _ glnzel , 2006 ) . in a proper statistical perspective , beirlant and einmahl ( 2010 ) have managed the empirical @xmath0-index as the estimator for a suitable statistical functional of the citation - count distribution .",
    "accordingly , these authors have proven the consistency of the empirical @xmath0-index and they have given the conditions for its large - sample normality .",
    "in addition , beirlant and einmahl ( 2010 ) have provided an expression for the large - sample variance of the empirical @xmath0-index and a simplified formula for the same quantity when the underlying citation - count distribution displays pareto - type or weibull - type tails .",
    "these two special families have central importance in bibliometrics , since heavy - tailed citation - count distributions are commonly assumed ( see _ e.g. _ glnzel , 2006 , and barcza and telcs , 2009 ) .",
    "beirlant and einmahl ( 2010 ) have developed the asymptotic theory for the empirical @xmath0-index by assuming a continuous citation - count distribution , even if the citation number is obviously an integer .",
    "hence , scientometricians may demand results on the empirical hirsch index under a more general approach . thus , on the basis of a suitable reformulation of the empirical @xmath0-index , we provide distributional properties , as well as exact expressions for the mean and variance , of the empirical @xmath0-index when citation counts follow a distribution supported by the integers .",
    "moreover , the general large - sample properties of the empirical @xmath0-index are obtained and the link between the `` integer '' and the `` continuous '' cases is fully analyzed .",
    "in addition , a simple and consistent nonparametric estimator for the variance of the empirical @xmath0-index is also introduced under very mild conditions .",
    "accordingly , the achieved theoretical results are assessed in a small - sample study by assuming some specific heavy - tailed distributions for the citation counts .",
    "finally , an application to the `` top - ten '' researchers for the web of science archive in the field of statistics and probability during the period 1985 - 2010 is carried out .",
    "let @xmath3 be a positive random variable ( r.v . ) and let @xmath4 be the corresponding survival function ( s.f . ) , _ i.e. _    @xmath5    even if @xmath3 is a discrete r.v . in the common bibliometric applications",
    "( since it represents the citation number for a paper of a given scholar ) , we actually provide a more general approach . similarly to beirlant and einmahl ( 2010 ) , it is assumed that @xmath6 for each @xmath7 since an unbounded support for the r.v .",
    "@xmath3 is usually required in scientometrics ( egghe , 2005 ) .",
    "if the left - hand limit of @xmath4 is denoted by    @xmath8    on the basis of the hirsch definition of the empirical @xmath0-index reported in the introduction , for each integer @xmath9 , a `` natural '' expression for the theoretical hirsch index @xmath10 , corresponding to the law of @xmath3 , is given by    @xmath11    obviously , it turns out that @xmath12 since @xmath4 is a strictly positive function .",
    "it is at once apparent that ( 2.1 ) encompasses the definition of the theoretical @xmath0-index given by beirlant and einmahl ( 2010 ) when the r.v .",
    "@xmath3 is assumed to be continuous .",
