    "consider the _ hypergeometric differential equation _ @xmath0 and define its _ schwarz map _ by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are linearly independent solutions of [ eq : hgde ] and @xmath4 is the complex projective line .",
    "the schwarz map of the hypergeometric differential equation was studied by schwarz when the parameters @xmath5 are real .",
    "since the work on schwarz study was a great success , many kinds of high - dimensional versions are studied analytically , algebro - geometrically and arithmetically , in these decades .",
    "but the authors have had a slight reservation about the schwarz map in : its target seems not to be exactly the correct one , because even if the monodromy group of @xmath6 , the projective monodromy group of the equation , is discrete in @xmath7 , it does not , in general , act properly discontinuously on any non - empty open set of the target @xmath4 , and so the image would be chaotic .",
    "we propose a variation of the schwarz map ( _ hyperbolic schwarz map _ ) , which solves the difficluty above .",
    "it is defined as follows : change the equation [ eq : hgde ] into the so - called @xmath8-form : @xmath9 and transform it to the matrix equation @xmath10 we now define the _ hyperbolic schwarz map _ , denoted by @xmath11 , as the composition of the ( multi - valued ) map @xmath12 and the natural projection @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a fundamental solution of the system , @xmath15 the space of positive - definite hermitian matrices of size @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the multiplicative group of positive real numbers ; the space @xmath18 is called the _ hyperbolic @xmath19-space_. note that the target of the hyperbolic schwarz map is @xmath18 , whose boundary is @xmath4 , which is the target of the schwarz map . in this sense , our hyperbolic schwarz map is a lift - to - the - air of the schwarz map .",
    "note also that the monodromy group of the system acts naturally on @xmath18 .",
    "here we state a defect of our hyperbolic schwarz map .",
    "there are no standard way to transform our equation [ eq : hgde ] into a matrix system ( this freedom is often called the _ gauge ambiguity _ ) ; we made a choice .",
    "the cost is that the symmetry of the equation [ eq : hgde ] , which descends to the schwarz map , does not necessarily descends to the hyperbolic schwarz map .    but , on the contrary , thanks to this choice",
    ", the image surface ( of @xmath20 under @xmath11 ) has the following geometrically nice property : it is one of the _ flat fronts _ in @xmath18 , which is a flat surface with a certain kind of singularities @xcite .",
    "moreover , the classical schwarz map @xmath6 is recovered as the _ hyperbolic gauss map _ of the hyperbolic schwarz map as a flat front .",
    "the papers @xcite gave a method of constructing flat surfaces in the three - dimesnional hyperbolic space . since any closed nonsigular flat surface is isometric to a horosphere or a hyperbolic cylinder , such surfaces have necessarily singularities : generic singularities of flat fronts are cuspidal edges and swallowtail singularities @xcite , see section  [ sec : sing ] .",
    "we will publish a series of papers about the hyperbolic schwarz map and its singularities ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the first one . in this paper",
    ", we study the hyperbolic schwarz map @xmath11 of the equation [ eq : hgde ] when the parameters @xmath5 are real , especially when its monodromy group is a finite ( polyhedral ) group or a fuchsian group . in general , generic singularities of flat fronts are cuspidal edges and swallowtails , in our special cases , we find that , in each case , there is a simple closed curve @xmath21 in @xmath20 around @xmath22 , and two points @xmath23 such that the image surface has cuspidal edges only along @xmath24 , and has swallowtails only at @xmath25 .",
    "we made our best to visualize the image surfaces ; we often show part of the surfaces , several copies of the images of @xmath26 , since each of the images of the three intervals @xmath27 and @xmath28 lies on a totally geodesic surface in @xmath18 .    in a computational aspect of this visualization , we use the composition of the hyperbolic schwarz map @xmath29 and the inverse of the schwarz map @xmath6 , @xmath30 , especially when the inverse of the schwarz map is single - valued globally ; refer to section  [ sec : schwarz ] .",
    "this choice is very useful , because the inverse map is often given explicitly as an automorphic function for the monodromy group acting properly discontinuously on the image of the schwarz map .",
    "moreover , in one of the cases where we treat the lambda function for drawing pictures , it is indispensable , because we have a series that converges very fast .    in the forthcoming papers we mentioned , we inroduce the derived schwarz map , investigate an associated parallel family of flat fronts , and study confluence of swallowtail singularities .",
    "basic ingredients of the hypergeometric function and its schwarz map can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ acknowledgment _ : after the authors posted the first manuscript in arxiv , professor d. dumas informed them about the paper @xcite , which introduced the notion of hyperbolic gauss map to nonsingular surfaces in @xmath18 , and made some useful comments .",
