    "a variety of techniques including simultaneous differential imaging @xcite , spectral differential imaging @xcite , angular differential imaging @xcite , and others have been developed ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "whatever the approach , observations taken with either successive photometric filters or a spectrograph then measure the planet s thermal emission . in principle",
    "reflected light could also be detected from these planets , but the planet - star contrast ratios are much lower : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the planet s geometric albedo .",

    "similar to directly - imaged planets but easier to study are solivagant ( free - floating ) or widely - separated planetary - mass objects . whether these objects form like traditional planets is as yet undetermined ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",

    "these have no nearby host star and so can be characterized even by seeing - limited observations ( without the need for adaptive optics ) , just as brown dwarfs have been studied for several decades .",
    "a further advantage of any type of direct imaging is that once the necessary contrast has been reached , one obtains much higher s / n and spectral resolution than is possible for a transiting planet of comparable brightness .",
    "this is because photon shot noise is much reduced by suppressing the host starlight and planets are visible all night , every night rather than for just a few hours per orbit .",
    "transiting planets occult their host stars , resulting in a periodic flux decrement approximately equal to @xmath11  this is @xmath12 for earth orbiting the sun , but is @xmath13 for a 1.5@xmath14super - earth orbiting an m4 dwarf and 12%  for a typical hot jupiter .",

    "[ fig : methods ] demonstrates how transits , eclipses , and phase curves all provide complementary insights into a transiting planet s atmosphere .",

    "[ sec : hds ] .",
    "the most profitable tool for studying transiting exoplanet atmospheres has been space - based spectroscopy with hst , which has been used to study the atmospheres of a rapidly - growing number of both hot jupiters and sub - jovians @xcite .",
    "observations with spitzer and ground - based telescopes have also been frequently employed @xcite but with typically less secure characterization of atmospheric properties .",
    "jwst will soon be the superlative instrument for these studies , providing over 10@xmath1 the total spectral range of hst / wfc3 , with a sensitivity @xmath53@xmath1 greater than hst and 8@xmath1 greater than spitzer @xcite .",
    "phase curves track the modulation of planetary thermal emission and/or reflected starlight throughout a planet s orbit .",
    "these observations complement secondary eclipses , which only measure emission from a transiting planet s day side .",
    "phase curves provide a wealth of information about planetary atmospheric dynamics and energetics by measuring longitudinal brightness temperature maps , thereby constraining atmospheric conditions across the planet s surface .",
    "the phase curve amplitude determines the day - night temperature contrast in the thermal infrared , or constrains the planet s albedo at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the phase offset measures the longitude of the planet s brightest or dimmest point relative to the substellar meridian .",
    "phase curve morphologies are in general a degenerate outcome an atmosphere s radiative , advective , and drag timescales and the efficiency with which winds circulate incident stellar energy around the planet .",
    "if the incident stellar flux is immediately re - radiated , the hottest point on the planet is at the substellar point ( which receives the highest level of incident flux ) .",
    "nonzero infrared phase offsets thus imply heat transport around the planet .",
    "clouds or hazes can move the infrared photosphere to higher altitude , resulting in a larger observed temperature contrast and smaller phase offset @xcite . large phase offsets",
    "could indicate strong advection or drag forces @xcite or re - radiation of thermal energy deposited by shock fronts in the planet s atmosphere where supersonic equatorial jets transition to subsonic speeds @xcite .",

    ", one observes a system for some substantial fraction of an orbit @xcite .",
    "if the planet is transiting , one or more secondary eclipses provides an absolute reference to disentangle stellar flux from combined `` star plus planet '' light .",
    "if the planet does not transit , the resulting constraints on atmospheric properties are looser @xcite .",
    "while a phase curve provides substantially more information than a secondary eclipse , the former requires considerably more observing time and is more susceptible to degradation by slowly - varying , low - amplitude instrumental systematics @xcite .",
    "ground - based telescopes permit large , massive spectrographs with @xmath24 , vs.  a few thousand at most for hst or jwst .",
    "the increased spectral resolution dramatically increases the contrast of absorption features in exoplanetary spectra , more than making up for the increased calibration challenges resulting from ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "when applied to short - period hot jupiters , high - dispersion spectroscopy treats planet - star systems as double - lined spectroscopic binaries .",
    "the technique now regularly detects thermal emission from hot jupiters at the @xmath25 level relative to the star , ascertains whether targets have a temperature inversion , and measures molecular abundances as small as @xmath26 .",
    "this powerful new technique has produced a surge in the number of planets with robust molecular detections or constraints on atmospheric properties @xcite .",
    "a further strength of high - dispersion doppler spectroscopy is its applicability to non - transiting planetary systems , where high - dispersion observations break the @xmath27 degeneracy that plagues interpretation of non - transiting phase variations .    when coupled to an ao system ,",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopy can also be use to great effect to study directly imaged planets .",
    "this has been done for several planets at medium resolution @xcite and at @xmath28 ; for beta  pic  b @xcite .",
    "the latter type of observation directly constrains planetary rotation rates and could eventually place high - fidelity constraints on planets thermal structure @xcite and global 2d surface brightness profiles @xcite .",
    "the previous section describes the observations used to constrain an exoplanet s atmosphere , but these data do not automatically provide atmospheric parameters . only by comparison to physically relevant models can the parameters of interest  temperature , abundances , etc .",
    " be inferred . like the observations themselves , obtaining useful model - derived properties is challenging . in the simplest cases ,",
    "toy models provide useful insights  constraining temperatures via comparison with blackbodies @xcite , or deriving temperature and mean molecular weight from rayleigh scattering slopes @xcite  but typically more elaborate models are needed",
    ".    analyses of exoplanet atmospheres fall into two general categories : forward models , which assume a particular combination of parameters to generate an observable ( e.g. , a spectrum ) ; and the inverse or `` retrieval '' approach , which explicitly aims to determine the best - fit parameters and their uncertainties from the available data .",
    "the recent review by @xcite discusses both of these techniques . though sometimes seen as at odds with each other , the two approaches are complementary .",
    "forward models are essential to predict the observable properties of previously unobserved objects for which scant data exists .",
    "such models have played a key role in focusing attention on especially interesting or easily observable atmospheric features : e.g. , alkali absorption in hot jupiters @xcite . forward",
    "models also often include more detailed treatments of atmospheric properties which would be too time - consuming to include in a retrieval ; for example , dust formation and dispersal in substellar atmospheres @xcite .    retrieval tools ( * ? ? ?",

    "to adequately sample the atmospheric parameter posterior distributions in a timely manner various simplifications are often made : molecular abundances may be constant with altitude , thermal profiles may assume an arbitrary parametrization without enforcement of radiative equilibrium , and so forth .",
    "however , techniques and computing power are quickly advancing to the point where many of these assumptions can already be relaxed @xcite . in any case",
    ", the power of retrieval is that  subject to the model assumptions and the reliability of the data  the technique provides statistically robust confidence intervals on the desired parameters .    for whatever reason ,",
    "retrieval analyses have focused mainly on transiting planets ( with some exceptions ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while analyses of directly imaged planets have relied mainly on forward models .",
    "some of the latter studies compare observations to multidimensional grids of precomputed template spectra , though the variables are typically fewer than in the retrieval analyses described above .",
    "it seems likely that the field could benefit from the complementary perspectives that would be provided by application of retrieval methods to spectra of directly imaged planets .",
    "one of the first questions asked about an exoplanet s atmosphere is , `` what is it made of ? ''",
    "the last few years have seen rapid strides toward answering this question for a wide range of molecules and atomic species , as were seen in the preceding years for studies of brown dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "progress in both these areas will only accelerate in the coming years : spectroscopy with new facilities such as jwst , wfirst - afta , and ground - based extremely large telescopes , and discoveries of many new planets from ongoing or imminent surveys from gpi , sphere , tess , and gaia .",
    "direct imaging surveys using gpi , sphere , and similar instruments are already underway .",
    "these will discover and obtain low - resolution spectroscopy of perhaps dozens of young , self - luminous planets .",
    "the improved contrast provided by these facilities over existing instruments ( see fig",
    ".  [ fig : contrast ] ) will also permit higher - quality spectra of planets currently known .",
    "the astrometric gaia mission , also underway , is projected to find tens of thousands of planets on several - au orbits ; a fraction of these will also be accessible to characterization via direct imaging @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of these systems with ground - based systems and with jwst s significantly broader wavelength coverage @xcite will place ever - tighter constraints on the composition , chemistry , and thermal structure of giant planetary atmospheres .",
    "planetary variability and rotation rates will provide insight into circulation and cloud processes for a growing number of planets .",
    "optical - wavelength observations may reveal signs of ongoing accretion and planet formation ( sallum et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , and heroic efforts for a small number of systems could begin to detect starlight reflected from old , cold gas giants .",
    "studies of brown dwarfs will continue to lead the way in demonstrating what can be learned about cool , substellar atmospheres from reliable , high - quality data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    the upcoming transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess ) mission , scheduled for launch in 2017 , will find thousands of new terrestrial planets , sub - jovians , and hot jupiters transiting bright stars @xcite .",
    "many of these will be suitable for atmospheric study with jwst via transits , eclipses , and phase curves @xcite .",
    "proposals for jwst s guaranteed time and cycle  1 observations are scheduled for 2017 , which means that tess planets will arrive too late for observation in the first 12 years of jwst operations .",
    "fortunately , the k2 mission @xcite is already finding planets suitable for jwst transmission spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "there is an outside chance that transmission spectroscopy with jwst could reveal the features of truly earthlike atmospheres orbiting late - type m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "such measurements will be extremely challenging for even relatively favorable planetary systems ; whether these efforts will succeed depends on jwst s on - orbit systematic noise floor , which is as yet unknown . depending on the success of jwst s transit spectroscopy ,",
    "tess and k2 s discoveries may justify development of dedicated instruments or missions for dedicated spectroscopic surveys of large numbers of these new systems @xcite .",
    "the next generation of high - resolution , near - infrared spectrographs ( see table 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will measure abundances and planetary fluxes at multiple longitudes for short - period planets @xcite .",
    "together with low - resolution spectroscopic phase curves from hst and jwst @xcite , this means we are entering the era of precision exocartography : such observations will constrain temperature / pressure profiles and chemistry as a function of planetary longitude . from these observations",
    ", we can soon expect global temperature and chemical abundance maps for many exoplanets atmospheres , which will allow comparison to models of atmospheric circulation and chemistry at an unprecedented level of detail .      a decade from now",
    ", jwst s extended mission will be near its end ; spitzer , hst , kepler , and tess will be long defunct ; today s next - generation high - contrast imagers will have surveyed most of their accessible systems . at this point the two most - anticipated developments will be ( 1 ) the completion of one or more ground based , giant segmented - mirror telescopes ( gsmts ) operating in the optical and infrared , and ( 2 ) nasa s planned wfirst - afta mission , whose current design includes a high - contrast imaging system operating at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the gsmts will allow for instruments with significantly greater spectral resolution and angular resolution . with high - dispersion spectrographs , gsmts will measure atmospheric abundances and structure and determine the signatures of atmospheric dynamics for many more planets .",
    "such instruments will also be capable of creating global weather maps and movies of many brown dwarfs and some giant , young planets on wide orbits via doppler imaging @xcite .",
    "these large telescopes might even successfully detect o@xmath3 or other biosignature gases using high - dispersion spectroscopy on extrasolar planets orbiting small m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "any detection would require a dedicated campaign lasting many years @xcite , but such a result would capture the world s attention like never before .",
    "the angular resolution provided by a gsmt s large aperture greatly expands the feasible direct - imaging science cases .",
    "that these will include young , self - luminous planets has been long appreciated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "properly designed , these ground - based imagers could access a small number of temperate super - earths , along with substantial numbers of larger planets already known from radial velocity surveys @xcite .",
    "if high - dispersion spectroscopy is coupled to high - contrast instruments , then the dual advantages of both high - contrast and high spectral resolution would allow elts to probe yet fainter objects  perhaps even habitable , earth - sized planets orbiting nearby , bright m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "a comparable but more sensitive instrument is the 2.4m - diameter wfirst - afta @xcite .",
    "though still in its early stages , current plans call for a visible - wavelength , low - resolution integral field spectrograph capable of achieving planet / star contrast levels as low as @xmath74 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : contrast ] ) . this facility would enable a wide range of atmospheric science including reflected - light spectroscopy of many known planets ( down to smaller sizes than could be accessed by a gsmt ) , and potentially even the discovery or characterization of terrestrial planets in or near the habitable zone around the nearest , most favorable fgk stars @xcite  complementing the gsmt s high - contrast imaging around m dwarfs .",
    "it is hoped that these ground- and space - based efforts will in turn set the stage for a large - aperture , high - contrast , optical / infrared mission in the coming decades @xcite . aside from providing the best opportunity yet to survey worlds like our own , such a program would facilitate an incredible diversity of exoplanetary science and so continue to fuel the exoplanet revolution for many years to come .",
