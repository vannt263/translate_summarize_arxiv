    "the bright southern star @xmath0 sco ( hr 5953 , hd143275 ; ra @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) is listed in the bright star catalogue ( bsc ) @xcite as a b0.3iv star .",
    "it is listed in the sixth catalog of visual binary stars @xcite as a spectroscopic triple and occultation quadruple system ; however , the overwhelming evidence is that it is a binary system with very high eccentricity .    in 2000",
    "@xcite observed a remarkable brightening of this star and since then it has exhibited irregular variability .",
    "it is now classed in simbad as a b0.2ive star , and it has been suggested that it may be a @xmath8 cas type variable @xcite .",
    "we report here observations made with the sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ) from 1999 to 2007 that are consistent with the development of an optically thick circumstellar disk around the primary star and discuss the implications for our understanding of @xmath8 cas variable stars .",
    "the orbital elements for @xmath0 sco have been determined both from interferometry and spectroscopy ( see section [ sec : history ] ) but the elements found by the the two techniques are inconsistent . following",
    "@xcite we present a new analysis of the orbital and radial velocity ( rv ) data that simultaneously minimises the residuals in @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the cartesian coordinates of the secondary with respect to the primary projected onto the plane of the sky and @xmath11 is the heliocentric radial velocity of the secondary .",
    "this new solution is consistent with both the interferometric and spectroscopic data and allows us to estimate the masses of the a and b components of @xmath0 sco as well as the dynamical parallax of the system .",
    "the binary nature of @xmath0 sco was first reported by @xcite , who observed it during a lunar occultation in 1899 .",
    "this work was largely forgotten until 1974 when @xmath0 sco was rediscovered to be binary using lunar occultation @xcite , by interferometry with the narrabri stellar intensity interferometer ( nsii ) @xcite and by speckle interferometry @xcite . since then it has been regularly observed with speckle interferometry ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for references ) .",
    "@xcite observed @xmath0 sco with the masked aperture - plane interference telescope ( mappit ) . using his measurement and the measures previously obtained with speckle interferometry he was able to calculate an orbit for the system .",
    "the mappit data were also used to estimate the brightness ratio of the two components .",
    "the orbital elements were recalculated by @xcite . a revised orbit using more recent spectroscopic data has been calculated by @xcite but it is clearly inconsistent with the interferometric data .",
    "the accurate determination of the orbital elements using interferometry has proved to be rather difficult .",
    "part of the reason is that @xmath12 , the brightness ratio of the secondary to the primary , is approximately @xmath13 . for interferometric observations the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the fringe modulation due to the binary ( see equation ( [ eq : doublemono ] ) )",
    "is multiplied by a factor of @xmath14 and for @xmath0 sco this is approximately 0.3 .",
    "the other difficulty is the large eccentricity of the orbit ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] that there are no speckle observations near periastron since the two stars are too close to be resolved when using apertures of the order of 5 metres . the original motivation for this work was to observe @xmath0 sco near periastron with susi using a baseline of 40 m ( corresponding to an angular resolution of @xmath16mas for an observing wavelength of @xmath17 nm ) .",
    "the bsc @xcite noted that @xmath0 sco is a spectroscopic binary with a period of approximately 20 days ( see * ? ? ? * ) , although @xcite found a period closer to 80 days .",
    "more recent spectroscopy ( see below ) shows no clear evidence of a short period companion .    prior to 1993 @xmath0 sco",
    "had been regarded as a typical b star and was listed as a photometric standard in several catalogues @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite reported that the h@xmath18 profile showed emission on the flanks of the absorption line and they proposed that it should be classified as a be star .",
    "@xcite noted that this observation was made approximately 10 months after periastron and speculated that the two events might be related .",
    "@xmath0 sco was initially observed with susi using the original `` blue '' configuration described in @xcite .",
    "like most two - aperture interferometers , susi measures the squared modulus of the fringe visibility , and for binary stars this is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the visibilities of the primary and secondary respectively , @xmath23 is the brightness ratio , @xmath24 is the baseline vector projected on the sky , @xmath25 is the vector separation of the two stars , and @xmath26 is the wavelength @xcite . as explained elsewhere",
    "@xcite , due to the difficulty of calibrating binary star observations with the original , blue - sensitive susi instrumentation , the observed squared visibilities , @xmath27 , were fitted using @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are fitting parameters , and @xmath31 is the time . the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 reflect the fact that seeing diminishes the fringe visibility and that the seeing loss in general increases in a roughly linear fashion during the night .    in the case of @xmath0 sco",
    "it was assumed that the angular diameters of the individual stars were much smaller than the angular separation and that the orbital motion during any given night was negligible .",
    "it follows that @xmath32 and there are five fitting parameters : the angular separation @xmath25 , the position angle @xmath33 , the brightness ratio @xmath12 and the two empirical fitting parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath0 sco was observed on the nights of 29 , 30 , 31 may and 3 june , 1999 at a wavelength of 442 nm and a baseline of 5 m .",
    "based on the published orbital elements the rates of change in the position angle and separation were expected to be @xmath34 day@xmath35 and @xmath36 mas@xmath37day@xmath35 , respectively , and the variation over several nights should have been negligible compared to the observational uncertainties . the actual data , however , showed considerable night - to - night variation .",
    "it was eventually realised that this was the result of variable seeing . for each night",
    "the data were fitted using the procedure outlined above .",
    "the data were then scaled by @xmath38 to produce `` unbiased '' values of @xmath39 , and the data for the different nights were then plotted together .",
    "this immediately highlighted portions of the data that were badly affected by seeing .",
    "these data points were removed and the data refitted .",
    "after several iterations a consistent set of data was obtained for the four nights , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : merged_data ] .",
    "the best fit values for the angular separation , position angle and brightness ratio for the epoch j1999.4 are : @xmath40 the brightness ratio expressed as a magnitude difference is also listed in table [ table : magdiff ] along with the values obtained with the nsii and mappit .",
    ".the magnitude difference between the two components of @xmath0 sco [ cols=\"<,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    it is clear from fig .  5 in @xcite that their orbit does not fit the interferometric data as well as the @xcite orbit .",
    "conversely , their fig .  6 shows that the hartkopf elements do not reproduce their rv curve .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that the spectroscopic data provide a very precise value for the epoch of periastron @xmath41 .",
    "the symmetry of the rv curve around @xmath41 also implies @xmath42 is very close to zero .",
    "ideally one should fit the two sets of data simultaneously and we have followed the procedure outlined by @xcite with a few modifications . because @xmath0 sco is a single - lined spectroscopic binary it is natural to choose @xmath43 , the physical semimajor axis of the primary s orbit in kilometres , as an additional orbital element . for convenience",
    "the fitting algorithm actually optimizes the rv amplitude @xmath44 ; the semimajor axis is then found using the standard relation @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a numerical factor depending on the units of @xmath47 .",
    "is in days , @xmath48 .",
    "it is equal to @xmath49 or @xmath50 if @xmath47 is in julian or besselian years , respectively .",
    "] similarly we can also derive the mass function in solar masses : @xmath51 or @xmath52    the @xcite simplex algorithm was used to fit the objective function , which was essentially the same as the one used by @xcite except that the last term ( the sum of the rv residuals for the secondary ) was omitted .",
    "the uncertainties in the elements were estimated by monte carlo simulation .",
    "all the interferometric measures ( @xmath25 , @xmath33 values ) listed in @xcite were used as well as the measure reported here .",
    "where necessary the phases were adjusted by adding @xmath53 to make them consistent with that found by @xcite with phase - closure .",
    "the besselian epochs in the fourth catalog were also converted to julian epochs ( this made a small but significant improvement to the fit ) .",
    "a total of 36 interferometric measures were used .",
    "the 30 rv values were taken from table 3 in @xcite .",
    "the interferometric data span the epoch j1973.2 to j1999.4 ; the spectroscopic data are mostly concentrated around the epoch of periastron , j2000.7 , with four points measured near the epoch j2001.1 .",
    "the initial guesses for the orbital elements were taken from @xcite ; the initial guesses for the amplitude and the @xmath8-velocity were @xmath54km@xmath37s@xmath35 and @xmath55km@xmath37s@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the results of our analysis are shown in the last column of table  [ table : elements ] .",
    "this table also lists the elements previously obtained by @xcite and @xcite . the interferometric orbit is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] along with the data and the `` observed minus calculated '' ( o - c ) vectors . fig .",
    "[ fig : rv ] shows the rv data and the best fitting rv curve .",
    "the most significant differences between our orbital fit and the previous ones are in the semimajor axis and the period .",
    "we found @xmath56mas and @xmath57 yr ; these should be compared to the values of @xmath58mas and @xmath59 yr found by @xcite and assumed by @xcite .",
    "the other orbital elements are in excellent agreement with those found by @xcite , who inferred a value for @xmath60 from the h@xmath18 profile .",
    "the most uncertain quantity is the mass function .",
    "the large uncertainty in @xmath61 is almost entirely due to @xmath62 .",
    "the magnitude difference between the two components is @xmath63 , suggesting that the secondary is also an early type star . in this section",
    "we examine this in more detail and estimate the masses of the two components .    assuming that the two stars have the same age and chemical composition , the luminosity and mass are related by the empirical mass - luminosity relation @xcite .",
    "@xmath64    we have previously used this method to determine the masses of the two massive components of the @xmath26 sco system @xcite . in that case there was strong circumstantial evidence that the stars were formed at the same time : it is a triple system and the orbits of the secondary and tertiary lie in the same orbital plane . for @xmath0 sco there is no additional information to support the hypothesis that the two stars were formed together ; indeed , the fact that the orbit is so eccentric may be evidence that the system may have suffered some kind of disruption in the past .    because of the development of the emission region around the primary we also need to treat the brightness ratio with caution . although @xcite reported h@xmath12 emission prior to 1999",
    "there is no indication of photometric brightening and we believe that the emission region was optically thin in the continuum at this time .",
    "this is supported by the data in table  [ table : magdiff ] : there are no significant differences between the @xmath65 measured at the three epochs 1971 , 1991 and 1999 .",
    "the brightness ratio was measured at 442 nm and we assume that @xmath66 is equal to the b magnitude . to estimate the luminosity ratio we must know both the b - v and bolometric corrections ( bc ) for the two stars , but the spectral class of the secondary is unknown .",
    "we initially assumed that both stars had the same b - v and bc and used the mass - luminosity relation to make a preliminary estimate of the masses .",
    "we then used the zams model grid of @xcite assuming solar metallicity to determine the effective temperatures from the masses .",
    "the b - v and bolometric corrections were then found by interpolating the tables in @xcite .",
    "the luminosity ratio was found from the experimentally determined brightness ratio @xmath67 using : @xmath68 this was used to estimate the next approximation for the masses and the procedure was repeated until the solution converged .",
    "it should be noted that the interpolation formulas given by @xcite made this quite straightforward .",
    "four iterations were sufficient and we estimate the mass ratio @xmath69 for the two stars to be @xmath70 the individual masses can be determined from @xmath61 and @xmath69 : @xmath71    it should be noted that the choice of a zams model grid may introduce systematic errors as the @xmath0 sco system may be somewhat evolved . however , the uncertainty in the masses of the stars is dominated by the uncertainty in the mass function and consequently more detailed modelling is not justified at present .",
    "the colour indices for the a and b components found by the procedure outlined above are b - v = @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , suggesting that the spectral type of the secondary is approximately b2 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observation by @xcite that the spectroscopy suggests that the primary and secondary have similar effective temperatures .",
    "given the masses , the dynamical parallax can be found from @xmath74",
    "the revised hipparcos parallax @xmath75mas @xcite is in good agreement with our dynamical parallax .",
    "our parallax allows us to determine the physical size of the @xmath0 sco disk ; we estimate its diameter to have been @xmath76au in 2000/2001 and @xmath77au in 2005/2006 .",
    "the physical separation of the two stars at periastron is @xmath78au .    as noted previously",
    ", @xcite suggested that @xmath0 sco might be a @xmath8 cas type variable star .",
    "these are be stars that exhibit eruptive irregular variability , with light amplitudes reaching up to 1.5 in v @xcite .",
    "the bright b0.5e star @xmath8 cas is also a binary system that is slightly further away than @xmath0 sco ( its revised hipparcos parallax is @xmath79mas ) .",
    "it is well known for its unique and complex x - ray emission that consists of several distinct components .",
    "the evidence strongly suggests that the x - ray emission occurs at the be star itself or its disk @xcite .",
    "the orbit was determined by @xcite to be moderately eccentric ( @xmath80 ) whilst @xcite found the orbit to be circular .",
    "although this discrepancy has yet to be resolved it is nevertheless clear that the binary characteristics of @xmath8 cas , however , are quite different to @xmath0 sco ; in particular its orbital period is approximately 200 days .",
    "@xcite reported the mass of the @xmath8 cas companion to be @xmath81 @xcite ; according to @xcite the secondary is most likely a dwarf and is not a white dwarf or neutron star . in comparison",
    ", @xmath0 sco has a highly eccentric orbit , a period of 10.7 years and its companion is a relatively massive b2 star .",
    "x - ray emission typical of b stars had been detected from @xmath0 sco prior to the periastron events of 2000 @xcite , but we are not aware of any more recent x - ray observations . if @xmath0 sco is analogous to @xmath8 cas we would now expect its x - ray spectrum to exhibit some of the unusual features seen in the x - ray behaviour of @xmath8 cas .",
    "further work , particularly x - ray observations of this intriguing system , are needed to clarify the nature of @xmath0 sco .",
