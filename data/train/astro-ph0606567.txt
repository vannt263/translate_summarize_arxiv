    "the detection of an extremely bright prompt optical flash accompanying grb 990123 @xcite highlighted the possibility of using grb afterglows as backlighting sources to probe the high - redshift universe and the reinonization era @xcite .",

    "the optical / nir afterglow of grb 050904 was observed by different telescopes over almost five decades in time and more than six decades in flux density . due to its very high redshift",
    ", it was not detected at wavelengths shorter than the @xmath28 band .",
    "we compiled all data from the following papers : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all data were corrected for galactic extinction assuming @xmath29 @xcite , and then transformed into ab magnitudes @xcite . to transform the magnitudes into flux densities , we used the zero points given in @xcite to transform their data and standard zero points for all other data .",
    "data in @xcite , @xcite and @xmath30 data from @xcite are already ab magnitudes .",
    "the highest data density is available in the @xmath31 band .",
    "therefore , we started with the @xmath31 band to construct a synthetic light curve by achromatically shifting the other bands to the @xmath31-band light curve .",
    "this method is justified , as no systematic color evolution was found in the data set . for the normal forward shock evolution of the afterglow ( once the cooling frequency @xmath32 has passed the optical / nir bands ) such achromacy is expected .",
    "while the early steep - to - shallow transition at @xmath33 days may be chromatic , we only have @xmath31 band data at this time anyway . in the following",
    ", we will always assume an achromatic evolution of the afterglow .",
    "we fitted the @xmath31-band data with a broken power - law ( for more details on the fitting procedure , see * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth z06 ) . as @xcite have noted , the early @xmath31-band data before 0.3 days are brighter than the extrapolation of later data to these times , indicating the steeper decline from what could be a reverse shock flash . initially , we excluded these early data from our fit .",
    "we used the derived light curve parameters from the fit to the @xmath31-band light curve as a reference light curve and fitted the @xmath34-band data with this reference curve .",
    "we thus found a color @xmath35 .",
    "assuming @xmath36 , we shifted the @xmath34-band data to the @xmath31 zero point , merging the light curves .",
    "we then fitted the combined @xmath37 light curve again and shifted the @xmath34-band data points in small increments until @xmath38 is minimized , thus deriving the true @xmath35 color and the light curve parameters of the joint light curve which spans a longer time range ( 0.3 to 12 days in the observer frame ) and gives a better constraint on the post - jet break ( after 2.6 days ) decay slope @xmath39 ( it is @xmath40 ) .",
    "the @xmath41-band data ( where we make no distinction between @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and the @xmath44-band data were added in the same way .",
    "these additional shifts were not larger than 0.03 mag .",
    "we transformed the hst nicmos f160w ( ab ) data point from @xcite to @xmath34 ( ab ) by using the conv_ab value from the @xmath45 package @xcite , @xmath46 .",
    "as the final hst data point is corrected for host contribution , we also corrected the other data points in the same way . from the synthetic host spectrum presented in @xcite , we derived for the host galaxy a @xmath31-band flux density of 0.055 @xmath47jy , which transforms into @xmath48 .",
    "we assumed conservative errors of 0.3 mag .",
    "the effect of host subtraction is very small , at most 0.03 mag , since the last afterglow data point at 5 days is still 4 magnitudes brighter than the host galaxy .",
    "[ j ]      the @xmath49 composite light curve consists of an early steep decay @xcite , which goes over into a typical afterglow decay , followed by a further break , which is identified as a jet break @xcite .",
    "we fitted the two breaks separately , using the equation from z06 ( fixing the host flux to zero as the data have been corrected for host contribution ) .",
    "for the first fit , we excluded all data beyond 3 days from the fit . the break smoothness parameter @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "z06 ) had to be fixed to @xmath51 ( a negative value , as the break is from steep to shallow ) .",
    "the jet break was fitted with @xmath50 left as a variable in the fit . for this fit , data earlier than 0.3 days were excluded .",
    "we thus derived three decay constants , which we label @xmath52 ( the steep early decay ) , @xmath53 and @xmath39 ( the typical pre- and post - jet break decay ) .",
    "we then transformed all data from ab back to vega magnitudes using standard zero points .",
    "the @xmath30 data @xcite are already affected by ly@xmath54 damping . while we used the composite reference light curve to find the @xmath55 color , we did not implement the @xmath30 data in the derivation of the light curve parameters .",
    "we also did not implement the subluminous @xmath56 measurement from @xcite .",
    "@xcite give the tarot measurements both as flux density at 9500  and as @xmath28 magnitudes .",
    "we used the flux density and transformed it to @xmath30 magnitudes . comparing these with the @xmath28 magnitudes of @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath57 mag .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the @xmath58 color of 2.48 mag derived from late afterglow data at 1.2 days , where @xmath59 is the vlt fors2 @xmath60-band filter ( for details on the @xmath61 and @xmath59 filters , see * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath55 color derived at late times was then used to shift all @xmath30 data points to the @xmath31 zero point ( as always , we assume achromacy , i.e. , a constant spectral slope ) .",
    "the result is a final composite light curve which includes all data from the early prompt emission to the late hst detection . in the following ,",
    "when we speak of the @xmath31-band light curve , we always refer to this composite light curve .",
    "the results of the light curve fits using the @xmath49 light curve are given in table [ lc ] , and the complete composite light curve is shown in fig .",
    "as expected , @xmath53 derived from the two different fits ( cf .  [ sec22 ] ) agrees within errors .",
    "there is some scatter in the light curve data which leads to the high values of @xmath38 .",
    "this is either due to additional measurement uncertainties or small deviations from a power - law decay , as it has been found that the x - ray afterglow was extremely variable @xcite .",
    "the values we derived are in full agreement with those of other authors ( table [ lc ] ) .",
    "these light curve parameters are typical for afterglows ( see z06 for a compilation of light curve parameters of all pre-_swift _ afterglows ) . the light curve steepening @xmath62 is high but also not extraordinary ( z06 , their fig .",
    "we note that this is one of the few light curves that allow the smoothness of the jet break to be fitted as a free parameter , and the result is in full agreement with the potential relationship between @xmath53 and @xmath50 found by z06 ( their fig . 8) .    for our fit ,",
    "the extrapolation to very early times meets the earliest tarot detection at 0.002 days , similar to what @xcite find .",
    "however , the following plateau phase around 0.001 days and the flare are much brighter than the extrapolated light curve ( 1 and almost 3 magnitudes , respectively ) .",
    "this implies that the decay after the optical flare must be steep .",
    "taking into account the upper magnitude limit at 0.09 days @xcite , we find @xmath63 .",
    "such a steep decay implies that the flare could be either due to reverse shock emission or internal shocks from late central engine activity @xcite .",
    "since this is even steeper than @xmath52 , an additional break must exist , but no data are available during this time span . in particular , we find that the afterglow peaks at @xmath64 , which is among the brightest nir afterglows ever detected and is a first hint at its extreme luminosity .",

    "[ z ]      to construct the sed , we used the colors @xmath35 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 that were derived in  [ sec21 ] ( @xmath44 , @xmath31 , @xmath34 and @xmath41 data are not affected by lyman @xmath54 damping ) .",
    "the sed is fitted as described in k06 .",
    "first , we find an observed spectral slope @xmath80 .",
    "then the sed was fitted with an additional dust extinction curve , using dust models for the milky way , the large and the small magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "this gives us the extinction in the @xmath81 band in the host galaxy frame @xmath82 and an intrinsic spectral slope @xmath83 , corrected for the host extinction .    to extend the sed further into the optical bands ( in the observer frame ) , we used reported @xmath84 upper limits .",
    "by shifting the composite light curve to these limits , we produced additional @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 colors which are lower limits on these colors . instead of a flat or downward curved sed , we actually found a slight upward curvature , mainly due to the @xmath44-band data ( which have large errors ) being slightly too bright ( fig .",
    "2 , this can also be seen in figs . 2 and 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a fit with smc dust , which is typically favored for grb host galaxies ( k06 , and references therein ) , finding a negative extinction , which is unphysical .",
    "the best result is actually obtained for milky way dust , even though this does not imply that the host galaxy of grb 050904 has dust resembling that of the milky way . while smc dust is characterized by strong far - ultraviolet extinction , mw dust has a much flatter extinction curve at these wavelengths .",
    "indeed , @xcite have found dust with flat fuv extinction in a quasar at almost the same redshift as grb 050904 , and @xcite find that the optical and x - ray afterglow of grb 020405 can be explained by dust with similar properties , although this grb lies at a much closer redshift .",
    "the characteristic 2175  bump of mw dust is not visible due to the very low extinction value we derive .",
    "we thus conclude that the extinction in the host galaxy is very low and the dust is dissimilar to smc - type dust . in the following , we will use the values derived from the mw dust fit , deeming this as a conservative approach .",
    "the results of the sed fitting are given in table [ sed ] .",
    "once again , our fits are in good agreement with those of other authors , except for @xcite , who ascribe the low value they derive to possible short term fluctuations . @xcite and @xcite also note that while source frame dust extinction may be present , it must be low .",
    "the hydrogen column density along the line of sight in the host galaxy derived via optical spectroscopy is large ( log @xmath88 , * ? ? ?",
    "coupled with the very low extinction , this implies a dust - to - gas ratio that is even lower than for the smc .",
    "the result is similar to grb 990123 , and in this case also , the prompt flash may have burned dust along the line of sight ( cf .",
    "fig . 6 in k06 , and references therein ) .",
    "knowledge of the light curve parameters and the intrinsic spectral slope allows us to derive conclusions on the nature of the circum - burst environment via closure relations @xcite .",
    "we find that using @xmath53 and @xmath83 , a model is strongly favored where the cooling break frequency @xmath32 lies redward of the source frame ultraviolet after 0.4 days .",
    "this is substantiated by the spectral slope of the late x - ray afterglow , which is identical to that in the ultraviolet within errors .",
    "@xcite find @xmath89 , @xcite find @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite used their radio detections of the afterglow of grb 050904 to perform broadband modeling and arrived at the same conclusion . in this case , one can not draw any conclusion on whether the grb environment is of constant density ( ism ) or is shaped by a progenitor wind .",
    "the observed very soft jet break ( @xmath91 , table [ lc ] ) may be indicative of a wind environment @xcite , whereas @xcite use an ism model .",
    "finally , @xcite propose that the afterglow passes through a termination shock somewhere before 0.5 days in the observer frame , switching from an early wind medium to a late ism medium .",
    "given the location of @xmath32 redward of the optical / nir bands , an electron spectral index of @xmath92 is found , which is typical for grb afterglows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the standard fireball model predicts @xmath93 @xcite , consistent with the @xmath39 we find within @xmath94 ( table [ lc ] ) .",
    "in the observer frame @xmath95 band , the afterglow was unobservable due to lyman damping .",
    "typically , grb afterglows have the highest data density in the @xmath95 band , and all afterglows that were examined in k06 were @xmath95-band afterglows . because of the synchrotron nature of the afterglow radiation ( described by a power - law , @xmath96 , with @xmath83 being the spectral slope ) , and assuming @xmath97const .",
    ", we can construct the @xmath95-band light curve from the @xmath31-band light curve .",
    "the spectral slope we derived from the observer frame nir data can be extrapolated into the observer frame optical , allowing us to find a @xmath85 color without the damping influence of lyman @xmath54 .",
    "for this purpose , we used the observed spectral slope that has not yet been corrected for host galaxy extinction , @xmath80 .",
    "since the host galaxy extinction is very low , the spectral curvature is negligible and we can use a simple power - law for the extrapolation .",
    "this power - law has an error from the fitting process , which we added in quadrature to the measurement errors of the data points .      in order to place the afterglow of grb 050904 in the context of the afterglow sample discussed in k06",
    ", we shifted the afterglow to a redshift @xmath2 . using the derived intrinsic spectral slope @xmath83 , the source frame extinction @xmath82 ( both from the mw dust fit ) and the redshift , we computed the magnitude shift denoted @xmath98 in k06 .",
    "this shift takes into account the extinction correction , the redshift difference and cosmological @xmath99-corrections @xcite when moving the source from its original redshift to @xmath2 .",
    "the magnitude shift creates a further error ( from @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) which we again added in quadrature to the errors of the data .",
    "we find @xmath102 mag , which is higher than any value found in k06 . applying this correction to the @xmath95-band afterglow",
    ", we finally arrive at our main result : had grb 050904 lain at @xmath2 and been unaffected by any line - of - sight extinction ( including lyman @xmath54 damping ) , the optical flare detected by tarot would have peaked at @xmath103 , almost visible to the naked eye .",
    "this is more than one magnitude brighter than the reverse shock peak of grb 990123 ( the flux density is higher by a factor of 2.8 ) , making the afterglow of grb 050904 the most luminous optical transient ever detected .",
    "@xcite , neglecting @xmath99-correction , find a peak flux density of 1080 mjy ( in the @xmath81 band ) for the afterglow of grb 990123 and 1300 mjy ( in the @xmath28 band ) for the afterglow of grb 050904 after scaling it to the redshift of grb 990123 , but do not remark upon this further except to call the two events comparable . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the absolute @xmath95-band magnitude is @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , making the afterglow in the @xmath95 band alone between 60 and 600 times brighter than the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the gravitationally lensed",
    "hyperluminous bal quasar apm 08279 + 5255 , the most luminous persistent source known @xcite .",
    "the complete composite @xmath107band light curve is shown in comparison with other afterglows in fig .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the optical afterglow of grb 050904 was much brighter than any other afterglow over almost two decades in time . at the peak of the prompt flash , it was six magnitudes brighter than grb 021004 , which is the brightest afterglow at late times , and another six magnitudes brighter than grb 041006 , one of the faintest grbs in the sample .",
    "this span is much larger than at one day after the grb , where the afterglow luminosities tend to cluster ( k06 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at later times ,",
    "though , it resembles other afterglows . at one and four days after the burst ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we find @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , which transforms to absolute magnitudes @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively ( cf . k06 , their figs . 9 and 10 ) .",
    "this ranks it among the brightest afterglows at one day , but it is not the brightest , as it has also been noted by @xcite . at four days after the burst , it lies close to the center of the luminosity distribution .      since no multi - color data for the prompt emission phase are available , we shifted the early optical emission achromatically , assuming no spectral changes between this phase and the late afterglow phase ( where no color evolution is evident ) .",
    "the assumption of achromacy for the first 100 seconds after a grb is surely an oversimplification .",
    "strong spectral changes are expected within this time @xcite .",
    "however , does this imply that the true luminosity of the flare was actually lower than what we have derived ?",
    "the spectral slope of the late optical / nir afterglow , consistent with the cooling break lying at longer wavelengths than the optical , is very steep , @xmath112 . during the prompt emission",
    ", the forward shock afterglow is expected to be in the fast cooling phase ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "if the medium surrounding the grb progenitor is of constant density ( ism model ) , the optical band lies between the cooling frequency @xmath32 ( at longer wavelengths ) and the peak frequency @xmath113 , the expected spectral slope is @xmath114 . in case",
    "even the cooling frequency has not yet passed the optical bands , the spectral slope in the optical actually rises , with @xmath115 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a similar situation would be seen if the early optical emission is dominated by the low energy tail of the prompt emission , a situation which was seen for grb 041219a and grb 050820a @xcite .",
    "this has also been suggested for grb 050904 @xcite , although the optical flux in the flare is much brighter than the extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum for grb 050904 @xcite , in contrast to the cases of grb 041219a and grb 050820a @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the spectrum in the optical bands during the prompt emission was not steeper than at late times , and possibly shallower , i.e. @xmath116 .",
    "on the one hand , this implies that the @xmath95 magnitude of the afterglow at @xmath0 would be brighter than what we derived with the spectral slope of the late afterglow . on the other hand ,",
    "when we apply the cosmological shift to @xmath2 , the @xmath98 shift would become smaller .",
    "we find @xmath117 mag for @xmath114 and @xmath118 mag for @xmath115 ( also correcting for the small host extinction ) , resulting in @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "thus , for @xmath115 , the extrapolated @xmath95-band magnitude at @xmath2 of the flare would be comparable to that of grb 990123 .",
    "however , we should also note that the same argument may apply to the flare of grb 990123 , so that the flare of grb 050904 truly is brighter with a high probability .",
    "in the literature on grb 050904 , consensus is not reached on whether grb 050904 is , apart from its redshift , a special event .",
    "let us review some aspects of both the prompt emission and the afterglow :    in many ways , grb 050904 does not differ from the typical mean values found for grbs . in the source frame , @xmath121 seconds , with @xmath1-ray emission detected up to 69 seconds after the trigger , including the flare seen prominently in the x - rays and the optical @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic luminosities of the x - ray @xcite , the late optical ( as shown in this work ) and the radio afterglow @xcite are typical , as are the light curve decay parameters and the jet break time in the rest frame ( z06 , k06 ) .",
    "but some aspects of grb 050904 do stand out .",
    "the peak energy @xmath122 lies beyond the _ swift _ bat energy range . from joint",
    "fitting of _ swift _ bat and _ suzaku _ wam data , @xcite report a _ preliminary _",
    "@xmath123 kev , translating into @xmath124 kev in the rest frame .",
    "this peak energy is the highest found in the compilation of 56 bursts @xcite , only grb 050717 ( observer frame @xmath125 kev , time - integrated spectrum , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) very probably has a higher peak energy ( the redshift is not known but assumed to be high ) .",
    "the isotropic energy is not exactly known , @xcite derive @xmath126 erg .",
    "the upper end of the range is higher than for any other burst , including grb 990123 @xcite , and even the lower value is higher than for most grbs with well - determined @xmath127 . using a jet break time of @xmath128 days , @xcite derive log @xmath129(erg)@xmath130",
    "this is the second highest beaming - corrected energy ever found @xcite , after grb 050820a ( log @xmath129(erg)@xmath131 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .the x - ray afterglow is the most variable ever seen by _ swift _",
    "@xcite , implying that , in the source frame , the central engine was active for several hours after the burst @xcite .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the early optical / nir emission is brighter than for any other grb detected so far .",
    "@xcite derive a high circum - burst density of 680 @xmath132 from broadband afterglow modeling , noting that a density typical for grb environments ( 10 @xmath132 ) is ruled out by the absence of a bright early radio afterglow .",
    "there is no aspect of grb 050904 that exceeds the typical grb parameters so much that one could claim that the progenitor of grb 050904 was markedly different from those of all other long grbs , e.g. a population iii star .",
    "however , it is clear that grb 050904 is one of the most extreme grbs ever observed , comparable only to grb 990123 ( cf .",
    "* ) , and exceeding even this seminal event in some aspects .",
    "we have shown that the early flare of grb 050904 detected by the tarot telescope is the most luminous optical / nir transient ever detected , exceeding even the peak magnitude of the prompt optical flash of grb 990123 . while grb 050904 is not markedly different from other grbs in any single aspect , it is among the most extreme grbs ever detected .",
    "so far , only a single grb at the end of the reionization era has been detected .",
    "it is thus not possible to decide whether grb 050904 is typical for grbs at a very high redshift , or if it is simple observational bias that the first grb to be found at @xmath133 is one of the most extreme events ever detected .",
    "more typical events would not have sufficient follow - up to determine the necessary parameters , especially the redshift .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite , with its high sensitivity in an energy band that is typical for highly redshifted hard bursts and its possibility of long - duration image triggers , is a very powerful instrument for detecting these very distant events .",
    "probably , more very high redshift grbs will be detected during the lifetime of _ swift _ , possibly even breaking the redshift records for quasars @xcite and galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , a grb at a higher redshift than grb 050904 may have already been found , grb 060116 @xcite .",
    "while the detection of a grb by _ swift _ is the first and most important step , most parameters characterizing the event can only be obtained by ground - based telescopes .",
    "the determination of the true burst energetics depends on the measurement of the redshift and the jet break time , and grbs at @xmath133 are bright only in the nir .",
    "while optical spectroscopy is still feasible to @xmath134 , any higher redshifts will move the metal lines that are used for an exact determination of @xmath135 beyond the typical limit of optical spectroscopy ( and the region beyond @xmath136 m is already strongly affected by sky lines ) .",
    "nir spectroscopy even at large facilities needs bright sources , and thus far , nir spectroscopy of a grb afterglow has never been successful in detecting any lines .",
    "the dilemma is that observing time at large facilities is precious and observations would only be triggered in case there is already a strong suspicion that the event lies at a very high redshift .",
    "this implies the need for rapid photometric redshift determinations that use the lyman @xmath54 trough , as it has been successfully applied to grb 050904 @xcite .",
    "one telescope that is already in use and has the capability for rapid multi - color photometry is the magnum telescope , which also observed grb 050904 @xcite .",
    "a key element would be the deployment of more moderately large robotic nir telescopes such as pairitel @xcite and rem @xcite , which also has an optical camera .",

    "<S> with a redshift of @xmath0 , grb 050904 is the most distant gamma - ray burst ever discovered . </S>",
    "<S> it was an energetic event at all wavelengths and the afterglow was observed in detail in the near - infrared bands . </S>",
    "<S> we gathered all available optical and nir afterglow photometry of this grb to construct a composite nir light curve spanning several decades in time and flux density . </S>",
    "<S> transforming the nir light curve into the optical , we find that the afterglow of grb 050904 was more luminous at early times than any other grb afterglow in the pre-_swift _ era , making it at these wavelengths the most luminous transient ever detected . given the intrinsic properties of grb 050904 and its afterglow , we discuss if this burst is markedly different from other grbs at lower redshifts . </S>"
