    "quantum communication between different registers / processors is a vital task in fast developing quantum technology . using mobile particles , such as photons or",
    "moving electrons , for carrying information is one option which either faces the complexity of interface equipments for different physical objects ( e.g. photons and electrons ) or needs a fine control over the bus which is still challenging @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to let the information _ flow _ through a quantum channel , physically realized by a chain of permanently coupled localized particles , exploting the dynamical properties of the channel itself .",
    "there are several possibilities for realizing channels that might serve this purpose , amongst which spin-1/2 chains have revealed particularly suitable for transferring quantum information from one point to another @xcite .",
    "depending on the specific physical realization of the overall system , it might be easier to act on the structure of the hamiltonian ruling the channel dynamics or to prepare the channel in a specific initial state .",
    "for instance , spin chains in solid state physics represent a vast reservoir of possible quantum channels , characterized by the most diverse hamiltonians , though with fixed parameters @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "initializing a spin chain embedded on a solid - state matrix might be a hard task .",
    "quite complementary , recent progress in optical lattices are making a real chance out of several theoretical proposals for realizing spin chains with cold atoms @xcite , though with some restrictions on the structure of the effective spin hamiltonians actually attainable @xcite .",
    "moreover , different initial states can be realized in an optical lattice @xcite , and new cooling techniques @xcite also provide the possibility of reaching temperatures in which the magnetic phases are not disturbed by thermal fluctuations and so the real magnetic ground state of the system becomes reachable .",
    "there are two essential features that characterize quantum channels made of interacting localized objects : their dynamics is dispersive , due to the non trivial structure of the many - body hamiltonian that describes the channel , and it depends on the initial state of the channel itself .",
    "dispersion is always detrimental to quantum information transmission , and designing a non dispersive channel requires a detailed engineering of the local couplings@xcite , which is practically hard to achieve .",
    "it is therefore relevant to understand up to what extent according to the type , parameters and the length , a homogeneous non locally engineered spin chain is usable for quantum communication . in particular , and at variance with some recent works in which high quality transmission is achieved independent of the system initialization @xcite we would like to see whether or not one can improve the quality of transmission by means of a specific initialization .",
    "another issue which is less studied in the literature ( unless very few cases for the case of engineered chains @xcite ) is the effect of hamiltonians which do not conserve the number of excitations .",
    "in fact our investigation here includes a wide class of hamiltonians which change the number of excitations during the time evolution .",
    "we consider quantum channels realized by finite spin-1/2 chains with homogeneous nearest neighbor exchange interaction of the heisenberg type , possibly in the presence of a uniform external magnetic field . as for the initial state of the channel we consider the ferromagnetic state , with all the spins parallel to each other , the nel state , where the spins are alternatively parallel , the state built as a series of singlets , and the ground state . in order to study the interplay between the properties of the channel hamiltonian and the structure of the initial state in determining the quality of the transmission processes",
    ", we specifically deal with different hamiltonians and different initial states .",
    "we present a comprehensive study for the transmission quality over whole phase diagram of the xy and xxz hamiltonians with the above initial states .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ setup ] we introduce our scheme for quantum state transfer and entanglement distribution in a general language . in section [ sec_xy ]",
    "we study free fermionic models , i.e. xy hamiltonian , while the section [ xxz ] is devoted to the xxz model as an example of interacting systems .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] we comment upon our results .",
    "the quantum channel consists of @xmath1 spin-1/2 particles sitting at sites @xmath2 to @xmath1 of a one dimensional lattice and interacting through the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the exchange integrals , @xmath6 is an external uniform magnetic field applied in the @xmath7 direction , and @xmath8 are the pauli operators of the spin sitting at site @xmath9 .",
    "we prepare the channel in some initial pure state @xmath10 , which can be either entangled or separable with respect to single - spin states .",
    "an extra qubit which carries the information is labelled by the site index @xmath11 and initially set in some arbitrary state @xmath12 . the schematic picture of the system is shown in fig .",

    "the density matrix of the qubit @xmath1 , namely @xmath21 , is obtained by tracing out the qubits @xmath22 from @xmath23 . on the other hand",
    ", one can define the superoperator @xmath24 which maps the initial density matrix of the qubit 0 , i.e. @xmath12 , to the density matrix of qubit @xmath1 at time @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath25 , according to @xmath26.\\ ] ] when the transmission of a generic pure quantum state @xmath27 is in order , according to the scheme depicted in fig .",

    "in fact , the quality of the channel is better assessed by the average fidelity @xmath31 , where integration is over the surface of the bloch sphere and @xmath32 the corresponding measure .",
    "there are essentially two mechanisms that cause average fidelity to deteriorate during a transmission process of the type we are describing : dispersion , which is a collective phenomenon due to the channel being an interacting many - body system , and local rotations . as a matter of fact",
    ", the average fidelity does not distinguish between bad transmission , i.e. dispersion of the state all over the chain , and good transmission with an extra rotation during the dynamics ; on the other hand , the latter can be safely handled with an extra unitary operation on the site @xmath1 , thus leaving dispersion as the _ only _ destructive effect in transmitting quantum states .",
    "assume a unitary operator @xmath33 , that does not depend on the state @xmath30 , is found such that the average fidelity for the rotated final state @xmath34 equals the maximum attainable value through the specific channel , then one could get a quantitative estimate of the dispersiveness of the transmission , which might be a very useful tool for characterizing the channel suitability for state transfer processes . aiming at such goal , we introduce the optimal average fidelity ( oaf ) @xmath35r{|{\\psi_{_0}}\\rangle } ~,\\ ] ] where maximization over @xmath33 guarantees that the effect of local rotations is removed .",
    "it is of absolute relevance that , as shown in appendix a , the oaf can be determined explicitly in terms of the superoperator @xmath24 @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the singular values , in decreasing order , of the matrix @xmath38~,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the pauli matrices . the optimal average fidelity , once computed via eq .  ( [ fav2 ] ) , gives a quantitative indication about how well a channel behaves , as far as the pure states transmission is concerned .",
    "notice that the above expression has the very same form of the maximal fidelity with respect to maximally entangled states @xcite , which , on the other hand is a completely different measure ( an entanglement measure , in fact ) .",
    "when entanglement distribution comes into play , mixed state transmission must be considered , and other strategies are necessary .",
    "let us prepare qubit @xmath11 in a maximally entangled state with an isolated qubit @xmath41 , see fig .",

    "the dynamical evolution cause the mixed state of qubit 0 to be transmitted to qubit @xmath1 , thus generating entanglement between qubit @xmath41 and @xmath1 .",
    "we can quantify the quality of such transmission by the amount of entanglement between qubits @xmath41 and @xmath1 at time @xmath17 .",

    "consistently with the transfer process , our scheme implies the existence of an arrival time when both the optimal average fidelity @xmath47 and the concurrence @xmath48 get their maximum value .",
    "in fact , due to the finite size of the chain , the information travels from @xmath11 to @xmath1 and viceversa multiple times , and the above quantities displays multiple peaks during the dynamics . throughout this paper",
    "we concentrate on the first peak , whose position defines the arrival time @xmath49 , as in a practical situation waiting for longer times is unwise due to the effect of decoherence .",

    "results for the nel state and the series of singlets are found to be very close to each other ( therefore only those for the former state are plotted ) : this shows that the inherent entanglement in the initial state has a very little effect when a state is attached at one end of a spin chain .",

    "[ fig7](a ) we see that even the oaf strongly depends on @xmath92 : for @xmath148 the ground state clearly gives the best possible initialization , while for @xmath149 the phenomenology is much more complicated . when considering the entanglement distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) the situation is somehow reversed , with a specific state , namely the ferromagnetic one , granting the best possible initialization for @xmath149 , and a more complex scenario for @xmath150 .    the general phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] embodies the complex balance between the effect of interference , which can be varied by acting on the initial state of the chain , and the dispersiveness of the channel which depends on @xmath147 .",
    "as we already noted , in the xxz case also the oaf is affected by interference , and the overlap of @xmath151 observed in fig .  [ fig7](a ) in the @xmath152 point is due to its corresponding to a non - interacting model , for which , as proved in section [ sec_xy ] , the oaf does not depend on the initial state . on the other hand , there is no @xmath147 value where the entanglement distribution is independent on the destructive effects of interference .",
    "therefore , the only mechanism for removing such effect is that of choosing a ferromagnetic initial state , whose dynamics can be resolved in the single particle sector @xcite where interference does not occur .",

    "indications about the effects of dispersiveness of the channel on the transmission processes can also be extracted : the ground state is seen to minimize such effects for whatever @xmath147 , though this implies a better entanglement distribution only for @xmath154 where interference probably plays a minor role leaving dispersion as the main destructive effect .",
    "in this paper we have studied the quality of state and entanglement transmission through quantum channels described by spin chains varying both the hamiltonian parameters and the initial state of the channel .",
    "we have considered a vast class of hamiltonians , including interacting and non - interacting fermionic systems , which contains some of the most relevant experimental realizations of one dimensional many - body systems , both in the framework of solid state physics and in the realm of cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "we find that if a free - fermionic model is available and an xy - like spin hamiltonian can be effectively realized , then the best possible tuning of the parameters is that corresponding to the xx model with a ferromagnetic initial state , both for state and entanglement transfer , whose quality stays surprisingly high even for chains as long as @xmath155 . in the anisotropic case , a state transfer of the same quality as that attained at @xmath116 ,",
    "is obtained for @xmath109 and @xmath53 : referring to the framework developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we infer that the relevant excitations lie in the linear zone of the dispersion relation and the resulting dynamics is essentially dispersionless .",
    "moreover , good results for both state and entanglement transmission are found in a wide range of the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath6 , providing the channel is initialized in its ground state .",
    "when an interacting xxz model with a specific @xmath147 is at hand , one has to choose whether to optimize the state or the entanglement transmission , since these goals are obtained with different initial states .",
    "in fact , we find that the optimal average fidelity is more sensitive to the dispersiveness of the channel , while the entanglement distribution is more sensitive to the interference with the initial state of the chain . as a matter of fact",
    "the former gets its maximum in the antiferromagnetic isotropic ( @xmath156 ) channel initialized in its ground state , while the latter is maximized by an xx ( @xmath152 ) channel initialized in a ferromagnetic state .",
    "our analysis show that the fidelity and the entanglement do not necessarily quantify the quality of quantum communication in the same way .",
    "namely , highest entanglement transfer can occur along a spin chain which is different from that giving the highest average fidelity .",
    "in fact , to the best of our knowledge , these results are the first example in which state and entanglement transmission show different features due to the different role played in such processes by dispersion , essentially set by the parameters of the hamiltonian , and interference , which explicitly depends on the initial state of the channel . however ,",
