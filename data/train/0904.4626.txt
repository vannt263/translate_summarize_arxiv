    "in recent years , observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) [ 1 , 2 ] , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations [ 3 , 4 ] , and large - scale structures ( lss ) [ 5 , 6 ] indicate that the universe is accelerating , therefore some form of dark energy whose fractional energy density is about @xmath3 must exist in the universe to drive this acceleration .",
    "dark energy has been one of the most active fields in modern cosmology since the discovery of accelerated expansion of our universe .",
    "investigation on the nature of dark energy becomes one of the most important tasks for modern physics and modern astrophysics .",
    "up to now , many candidates of dark energy have been proposed to fit various observations which include the simplest one , the einstein s cosmological constant [ 7 ] , or a dynamical scalar field , such as quintessence [ 8 ] , phantom [ 9 ] , k - essence [ 10 ] , tachyon [ 11 ] and so on .",
    "the present data seem to slightly favor an evolving dark energy with the equation - of - state parameter  ( eos ) @xmath4 around present epoch and @xmath5 in the near past .",
    "obviously , @xmath0 can not cross @xmath6 for quintessence or phantom alone .",
    "some efforts have been made to build dark energy model whose eos can cross the phantom divide . in a universe filled with quintessence and phantom fields this case",
    "can be realized easily .",
    "this implement of dark energy , called as quintom , has been first proposed in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] , where the quintom model with an exponential potential and the existence , stability of cosmological scaling solutions in the context of spatially homogeneous cosmological models have been investigated .",
    "phase - plane analysis of the spatially flat frw models shows that the phantom - dominated scaling solution is the unique late - time attractor and there exists a transition from @xmath5 to @xmath4 [ 13 ] .",
    "wei and cai [ 14 ] suggested a hessence model , in which a non - canonical complex scalar field plays the role of dark energy .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the hessence dark energy is also investigated ; it is found that the big rip never appears in the hessence model even in the most general case while beyond particular potentials and interaction forms .",
    "the action of dilaton field in the presence of einstein s cosmological constant has been derived in ref . [",
    "the potential is the counterpart of the einstein s cosmological constant in the dilaton gravity theory .",
    "since it can be reduced to the einstein cosmological constant when the dilaton field is set to zero , the dilaton potential is called the cosmological constant term in the dilaton gravity theory .",
    "compared to the ordinary scalar field , the action for phantom scalar field has only a sign difference before the kinetic term .",
    "later , the explicit expression of the phantom potential have been given in ref .",
    ". a model of the universe dominated by the dilaton field with a liouville type potential has been presented in ref . [",
    "17 ] .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the cosmological evolution of a two - field model of dark energy where one is a dilaton field with canonical kinetic energy and the other is a phantom field with a negative kinetic energy term with liouville type potentials .",
    "let us start from a 4-dimensional theory in which gravity is coupled to dilaton and maxwell field with an action : @xmath7 where _ r _ is the scalar curvature , @xmath8 is the usual maxwell contribution , @xmath9 is an arbitrary constant governing the strength of the coupling between the dilaton and the maxwell field , @xmath10 is a potential of dilaton @xmath11 which is given by ref .",

    "one can verify that the potential reduces to the einstein cosmological constant when @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "compared to the action of the ordinary scalar fields , the phantom field has one negative kinetic term . in order to obtain a real action of the einstein - maxwell field in the presence of the phantom",
    ", we can make substitutions in the action as follows ref .",
    "[ 16 ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the imaginary unit .",
    "thus we get the action @xmath18 and the potential for the phantom field @xmath19.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can also verify that , when @xmath20 or @xmath21 the action reduces to the einstein - maxwell action and when @xmath22 the action reduces to the einstein - phantom action .",
    "we consider the action in a simple model which contains a normal scalar field @xmath11 and a negative - kinetic scalar field @xmath23 , assuming that there is no direct coupling between the phantom field and the normal scalar field with such potentials , @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the lagrangian density of matter fields . considering a flat universe which is described by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric",
    ", the homogeneous fields @xmath11 and @xmath23 can be described by a fluid with an effective energy density @xmath26 and an effective pressure @xmath27 given by @xmath28 the corresponding equation of state ( eos ) parameter is given by @xmath29 then the equations of motion for the fields and the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the density of fluid with a barotropic equation of state @xmath32 with @xmath33 a constant and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 for radiation and @xmath36 for dust mater ) . the equation ( [ as7 ] ) is the friedmann constraint equation .",
    "in this section , we investigate the two - field dilaton model via the conventional phase space analysis . similar as in ref . [ 18 ] , we define the following new dimensionless variables @xmath37 ^ 2},\\nonumber \\\\",

    "strictly speaking , the above system is not an autonomous system .",
    "thus , if we want to discuss the phase plane , we need to find the constraints on the potential , or equivalently the conditions under which the potential may have the property we require in order that we can get some explicit results .",

    "substituting linear perturbations @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 into the four independent equations , we obtain the equation of perturbations to the first - order : @xmath74    the linear perturbations of system ( [ as4])-([as5 ] ) about each fixed point gives four eigenvalues .",
    "the theory of stability requires that the real part of all eigenvalues should be negative .",

    "@xmath83 , the equations ( [ as1])-([as2 ] ) have one fixed point type @xmath84 embedded in six - dimensional phase - space which corresponds to eigenvalues @xmath85 , @xmath0 becomes meaningless and @xmath86 .",
    "this indicates that the critical point is not a dynamical attractor .",
    "our numerical studies indicate that the eos parameter @xmath0 changes from @xmath87 to @xmath88 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "we have assumed that there is no direct coupling between the phantom field and the normal scalar field in this paper . without the loss of generality ,",
    "the initial conditions @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be fixed in order to get the eos today @xmath91 [ 19 ] , and the energy density of dark energy today @xmath3 .",

    "of the two - field dilaton model of dark energy .",
    "the blue line represents the eos of the two - field model , the black line represents the single dilaton model and the red line represents the single phantom model . ]",
    "in summary , we have investigated the possibility of constructing a two - field dark energy model which has the equation of state @xmath0 crossing @xmath6 by using the dilaton and phantom fields . we have made a phase - space analysis of the evolution for a spatially flat frw universe filled with a barotropic fluid and phantom - dilaton fields .",
    "it is shown that there exists the stable late - time attractor solution in the model .",
    "also , we showed that the equation of state @xmath0 can cross @xmath6 naturally .",
    "so the two - field dilaton field is a viable candidate for dark energy .",
    "it is apparent that our model is also plagued with the instability problem at the quantum level which makes its existence doubtful .",
    "in fact , this is a common problem for nearly all phantom models .",
    "however , as argued by carroll et al .",
    "[ 20 ] , these models might be phenomenologically viable if considered as effective field theories valid only up to a certain momentum cutoff . according to their discussions ,",
    "the instability timescale of the phantom quanta can be greater than the age of the universe provided that the cutoff is at or below 100 mev . in this sense ,",
    "the phantom quanta are stable against decay into gravitons and other particles .",
    "therefore , considering astronomical observations favoring the phantom model for dark energy , it remains open if the phantom matter exists and acts as dark energy .",
    "we are grateful to zhang xin - min , wei hao , feng bo for kind help and discussions .",
    "we also thank zhao gong - bo  for plotting the fig .",
