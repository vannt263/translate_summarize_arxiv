    "magnetohydrostatic equilibrium describes the balance of the magnetic and thermal pressures across individual sunspots @xcite . along the direction parallel to the solar surface , the local environment of a sunspot markedly shifts from the cooler , convection inhibited , umbral region , hosting multi - kilogauss magnetic fields , to the convectively turbulent , hotter , external plasma of the quiet sun with considerably lower magnetic flux density .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this inverse relationship between magnetic field strength and temperature remains unclear @xcite since umbrae host a wide range of thermal - magnetic field distributions @xcite .",
    "interesting , however , is the empirical relationship between peak magnetic field strength and minimum intensity for different umbrae @xcite . support a single power law to express this relationship . as such",
    ", the total magnetic pressure of a sunspot always _ more than _ compensates for the corresponding reduction in thermal pressure , leading to a predictably larger spatial extent for umbrae with greater field strengths @xcite and lower minimum intensities @xcite .",
    "however , to date , no study of the temporal stability of the relationship claimed by norton and gilman has been completed for a statistically significant number of umbrae .",
    "we are interested in whether this equilibrium structure is influenced by solar cycle progression .",
    "the recent study of 3931 umbrae by revealed a solar - cycle oscillation in average umbral intensity between 1992 and 2003 .",
    "this agreed well with the mean intensity variation observed by as well as both the mean intensity and magnetic field changes reported by ; though , both of those reports neglected the necessary size parameter , as addressed by .",
    "importantly , the intensity oscillation reported by @xcite occurs without any evident corresponding umbral size variation .",
    "this thus agrees with the constant umbral size spectrum shape observed over multiple solar cycles by . since the observed relationship between intensity and size did not change , the reported mean intensity oscillation insinuates that the magnetic field - size relationship changes over the solar cycle",
    "if the relationship claimed by @xcite is indeed constant .",
    "a cycle variation in the umbral magnetic twist might influence this relationship , but has not yet been observed @xcite .    as this is the only significant evidence for the local magnetic properties of sunspot umbrae being influenced by the evolution of the global solar field , further exploration is imperative as it may have implications to both the solar dynamo @xcite and umbral magnetic field orientation @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting , though , that reported a significantly lower number of sunspot groups with strong fields in odd numbered solar cycles compared to each cycle s preceding even numbered cycle pointing to a possible solar cycle influence on sunspot group generation .",
    "we address this topic more completely than previous authors by revisiting the data from the kitt - peak spectromagnetograms ( section  [ s : data ] ) used by to exploit its measurements of magnetic field for the first time in tandem with the intensity measurements .",
    "automating our sunspot detection ( section  [ s : selection ] ) yields the greatest number of umbrae so far measured for this type of study .",
    "we explore the temporal variability of the relationships between peak magnetic field strength , minimum intensity , and umbral size ( section  [ s : results ] ) to discuss the alleged dependence of sunspot structure on solar cycle progression .",
    "we analyze 2771 full - disk daily maps of line - of - sight ( los ) magnetic flux density and continuum intensity produced by the nasa / nso spectromagnetograph ( spm ) @xcite between 1993 and 2004 at the kitt peak vacuum telescope ( kpvt ) .",
    "each map results from the on - line analysis of scanned long - slit spectra in both states of circular polarization centered on the 8688   fe i absorption line ( land g @xmath0 1.66 ) as described in .",
    "values for los magnetic flux and continuum intensity are therefore spatially and temporally synchronous .",
    "the full - disk maps have a field of view of @xmath1 and a pixel size of @xmath2 .",
    "los magnetic flux measurements from spm are utilized despite problems alluded to by .",
    "new observations from the spectropolarimeter onboard hinode @xcite as well as more precise infrared measurements @xcite have shown that many synoptic magnetographs have underestimated magnetic flux , especially within active regions .",
    "mdi underestimates los field values in the penumbra by almost a factor of two @xcite .",
    "values from spm compare well with gong+ , but both are 2040 percent lower than mdi @xcite . in accordance with , we multiply the spm magnetic flux values by 1.41 to calibrate their values with mdi .",
    "we proceed with our use of the spm magnetic flux values since they are crucial to the study at hand , but we are careful to compare their results with other measurements .    as always , stray light is a considerable problem when discussing umbral intensity and it also can affect the determination of the magnetic field .",
    "we fully acknowledge that for a more precise description of the intensity of a sunspot , a stray light correction is necessary .",
    "daily stray - light corrections are unfortunately impossible with the spm for it is a scanning slit device in which the limb is observed at different times than the center of the disk .",
    ", though , studied the long term variation of stray - light within the instrument and found a very weak temporal trend ( about 0.5% ) .",
    "furthermore , as the spm measures the continuum at infrared wavelengths , intensity measurements are expected to be less affected by stray - light than instruments operating at visible wavelengths .",
    "thus , while stray light does affect our complete determination of the sunspot intensity , its effect is constant enough to allow us to comment on its solar cycle variability .",
    "we identify umbrae on the full - disk spm continuum maps using a thresholding method @xcite with a single definition for the umbra - penumbra boundary as in and .",
    "the contrast of features on each map is the ratio of the measured intensity to the local intensity .",
    "we define the local intensity using the legendre polynomial fits of observed continuum intensity with respect to the cosine of the heliocentric angle ( @xmath3 ) which are recorded in each data file header .",
    "this method reduces inconsistencies in determining the local photospheric intensity due to large multi - umbrae active regions as well as local brightenings due to diverted energy flux and plage regions around the sunspot @xcite .",
    "our umbra - penumbra boundary definition is set at a contrast value of 0.62 for the spm maps of continuum intensity near 8688  , which is slightly lower than that used by , 0.655 , and , 0.68 .",
    "this differs also from the variable umbra - penumbra boundary defined by , which will be discussed in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "our method for including complex spots is consistent with the approach used by other authors @xcite .",
    "multiple umbrae that share the same penumbra within single complex sunspots are treated as individual umbrae .",
    "we require these umbrae to be separated by at least one @xmath4 arcsec pixel with a penumbral intensity value , and each umbra must contain at least two observable pixels with umbral intensity values .",
    "our conservative intensity threshold value counts connected umbrae as one .",
    "furthermore , we find only 4.5% of the umbrae selected to be closely spaced , where we consider closely spaced to mean the smaller umbrae of a two - umbrae pair is less than two times its radius away from the nearest pixel of the larger umbra .",
    "we , in general , do not attempt to locate umbrae that are close to the limb ( @xmath5 ) since magnetic field values are less reliable , projection effects are difficult to remove consistently , and the wilson depression conceals a portion of the umbrae .",
    "we also verify the selection of each umbra using the synchronous maps of magnetic field .",
    "we require that each umbra have a peak magnetic flux greater than 50 gauss , which is more than three sigma deviations from the background noise of the spm magnetograms . in total",
    ", we locate 12967 umbrae between 1993 and 2003 .    for each umbra",
    "we glean values for the umbral area and radius , as well as the minimum continuum intensity and its corresponding magnetic flux density .",
    "the umbral area simply corresponds to its spatial coverage by counting the number of pixels observed and correcting for angular foreshortening .",
    "we calculate an  effective  umbral radius ( later referred to as simply the radius ) by assuming that each umbra is circular . using the solar ephemeris for each individual spm map ,",
    "angular units are converted into physical units ( 10@xmath6 km ) .",
    "the use of microhemispheres in section  [ s : size_dist ] is also corrected for the annual variation in the apparent solar semidiameter .",
    "all values of los magnetic flux and continuum intensity presented here reflect the value measured at the darkest point in each sunspot umbra , which nearly always corresponds to the peak umbral magnetic field strength .",
    "this dark umbral core evolves the least during its formation and evolution ( socas - navarro 2003 ) and is least affected by umbral dots , which affect the intensity distribution of the umbra but only minimally affect the determined umbral radius . furthermore , in the dark umbral core the magnetic field is known to be the most vertically directed which allows us to adopt the vertical field approximation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the heliocentric angle , @xmath9 , is the angular distance between the observer s line of sight and the local radial vector .",
    "in choosing to measure minimum intensity ( * i * ) , corresponding magnetic flux density ( * b * ) , and umbral size ( * r * ) , we parameterize a much more complicated system into merely three interdependent variables .",
    "we are interested not only in whether the interdependencies of these variables change over the solar cycle , but also whether the average umbral intensity and magnetic field vary as suggested by . for this",
    ", we begin with a size spectrum analysis of the observed umbrae to address whether the solar cycle influences the distribution of umbrae generated at a particular phase . a regression analysis",
    "is then performed to test the temporal stability of the b ",
    "r , and i  r relationships .",
    "we finish by showing the temporal variation of the mean intensity and magnetic field as in @xcite and carefully use the relationships derived to show that they are consistent with a temporal variation in size .",
    "as a much greater number of smaller umbrae appear on the solar disk than larger umbrae , our regression analysis requires binning to ensure that the smaller spots do not dominate the information available in larger spots .",
    "thus , prior to performing any regression analysis , the data is binned using the horizontal ( independent ) variable into bins of equal width . using the levenberg - marquardt least - squares procedure",
    ", the regression is derived between the mean values of the independent and dependent variables . the standard error of each mean is also carefully propagated into the analysis and is reflected in the regression error .",
    "an analysis of the spectrum of umbral sizes has been carried out in the manner described by .",
    "it is important to address the spectrum of umbral sizes over the solar cycle rather than merely the average size . deriving the size spectrum of umbrae",
    "has traditionally been used to comment on the generating mechanism for sunspot umbrae , whether that be flux - tube fragmentation or coalescence . in a similar fashion",
    ", we utilize the size spectrum as a means to explore the influence of the solar cycle on the generation of umbrae . as @xcite remark , however , the spectrum derived is not identical to the distribution of umbral areas at a particular time .",
    "rather , it is the statistical probability of locating a spot of a particular size on the solar disk at any given time .",
    "thus , it can not account for daily , monthly , or even annual variations of the mean umbral size , especially during solar minimum when solar activity is reduced .",
    "furthermore , unlike mere averaging of umbral sizes , the spectrum is influenced less by the ability to consistently select small spots ( comparable in size to the atmospheric seeing limit ) .",
    "the report of gave convincing evidence for a stable size spectrum , independent of cycle phase , between 1917 - 1982 .",
    "though , since we are studying a solar cycle not included in that study , it is important to address the spectrum observed for we can not assume one cycle is identical to another . for our selected umbrae ,",
    "we follow nearly the same procedure as @xcite to determine the log - normal distribution defined by @xmath10 where a is the umbral area ( in microhemispheres ) , @xmath11 is the spectrum mean , @xmath12 is the geometric standard deviation , and dn / da is the size distribution function .",
    "the distribution function and its error , which is conservatively taken to be the square root of the number of umbrae in each bin , is divided by the number of maps measured as in the @xcite study .",
    "we employ the levenberg - marquardt least - squares fit procedure to determine the fit parameters for our observed size distribution over different portions of the solar cycle .",
    "the error in the observed distribution is propagated into the fit .",
    ".size spectrum lognormal fit parameters [ cols=\"<,^,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the minimum umbral intensity versus umbral radius is presented in figure  [ fig : size_int ] .",
    "the data are binned by radius into bins of equal width ( 250 km ) before any regression analysis is attempted .",
    "thus , each data point represents the mean value of the umbral intensities in a given bin .",
    "the small hatted error bars give the standard error of each mean while the larger unhatted error bars show the observed spread of the data by illustrating the 10- to 90- percentile range of the data .",
    "the standard error of each mean is typically small and is propagated into the regression analysis .",
    "we find that a 2nd order polynomial , as opposed to a power law relation , lowers the reduced chi - square of the fit .",
    "similar to the previous sections , this analysis is performed for various portions of the solar cycle as well as the whole data set .",
    "no significant variation of the relationship is found over the solar cycle , which agrees with the analysis of and . for a quadratic fit of the form @xmath13 where r is the umbral radius in seconds of arc and i@xmath14 is normalized to the surrounding photosphere , we find these best fit parameters for r @xmath15 13000 km : @xmath16 , j@xmath17 , and k@xmath18 .",
    "the numeric values given in parentheses reflect the one sigma deviation of the fit parameters .",
    "the relationship is also plotted in figure  [ fig : size_int ] . additionally , the functions determined by and are provided in the figure . as each of these studies observes the continuum intensity at different wavelengths , the functions given by the authors have been altered using the planck function to reflect an lte approximation for the expected intensity of each previous study at the kpvt / spm wavelength ( see section  [ s : mag_int ] ) .",
    "we find some consistency between the kpvt / spm data and the stray - light corrected mdi data analyzed by . for larger umbrae ,",
    "the kpvt / spm values are larger than the mdi values suggesting a greater influence of stray light on these umbrae . for smaller",
    "umbrae , kpvt / spm gives a lower mean minimum intensity than the mdi data .",
    "the differences may be due to stray light effects , or different umbral radius threshold intensities , which change with wavelength as well as different author s determinations .",
    "we do not find a meaningful comparison between the presented data and the function provided by .",
    "finally , we address the previous reports of a temporal trend in the mean minimum intensity and mean magnetic field strength by examining these parameters as a function of time in the current data set . the filled diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : cycle_evol ] display the mean value of magnetic flux ( top ) and minimum intensity ( bottom ) for annual bins between 1993 and 2004 .",
    "the error bars give the standard error of each mean .",
    "the oscillation in mean minimum umbral intensity as reported by remains evident in our study though the oscillatory amplitude is reduced .",
    "a similar oscillation is notable in the mean magnetic field strength in the top plot .",
    "although @xcite found no significant temporal variation in the mean umbral size of their selection , our larger sample size reveals that the selection does exhibit a mean umbral size variation , as shown in figure  [ fig : cycle_evol ] . while the variation is smaller than the error in the size spectrum analysis given in section  [ s : size_dist ]",
    ", different bins show significant deviation from others . putting this to task ,",
    "we evaluate the expected variation in the umbral minimum intensity and corresponding maximum magnetic flux with time based only on the umbral size and the previously determined time - independent relationships ( equations  [ eq : size_mag ] and  [ eq : size_int ] ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient between the measured values of intensity and the calculated ones is 0.91 . between the observed magnetic flux values and the calculated ones ( excluding error ) ,",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.65 .",
    "we plot these values in figure  [ fig : cycle_evol ] as filled squares .",
    "the error bars associated with these calculated values reflect both the standard error of the annual bin as well as the one sigma error in the determined relationship between umbral radius and the two parameters shown . the one sigma error for the real values and",
    "the calculated values are comparable in the figure . for the mean minimum umbral intensity oscillation",
    ", we find that changes in umbral radius can account for the perceived oscillation . and for the magnetic field , all the values calculated from the umbral radii ( except 2003 ) are within the one sigma error of the measured values .",
    "the unchanging relationships of b  r and i  r fully account for the variations of mean umbral intensity and mean magnetic flux over the solar cycle due to a varying mean umbral radius .",
    "thus , the mean maximum magnetic field strength for the observed umbrae as well as the mean minimum umbral intensity do not give evidence for a solar cycle change in the equilibrium balance between sunspot umbrae and the quiet sun .",
    "our analysis of more than 10000 umbrae observed between 1993 and 2003 gives insight into the temporal stability of bulk umbral structure over the solar cycle , which has been debated since @xcite s initial report in 1978 of a cycle dependent change in sunspot intensity .",
    "we find the following :    1 .   the relationships of b ",
    "r , and i  r exhibit power law , linear , and quadratic relationships , respectively , and display no significant modulation during the solar cycle .",
    "2 .   minimum intensity measurements support umbral limb - darkening observed in the same spectral region by and can be corrected .",
    "the umbral size spectrum of the selected umbrae agrees with the conclusion of .",
    "the umbra size spectrum shape remains constant in time .",
    "the periodic variation of the mean umbral intensity and magnetic flux density over the solar cycle can be explained by a corresponding , yet nearly insignificant , change in mean umbral radius .",
    "our last result directly conflicts with who reported a solar cycle oscillation in mean umbral intensity without a corresponding mean umbral radius oscillation .",
    "that claim relied solely upon no variation observed within annually binned data whose standard errors were large primarily due to a lower number of selected umbrae .",
    "we expand the selection and address the dependencies on umbral radius directly , unlike all reports claiming a solar cycle variation in umbral intensity and/or magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we also test whether our umbral limb - darkening correction and the change in the umbra - penumbra boundary convention affect our result , and no change is evident .",
    "we find the unvarying relationship claimed by to be a fairly consistent representation of the bulk magnetohydrostatic equilibrium for sunspots over the solar cycle ; however , we also find that considerable scatter plagues the robust use of this relationship even for infrared measurements . along with the lack of a significant change in the size distribution of umbrae generated by the sun",
    ", we must conclude that no compelling evidence has yet been found to suggest that the equilibrium balance and/or mean umbral strength is influenced by the progression of the solar cycle .",
    "though , we add that significant annual variations in the mean umbral radius , as testified by the previously reported oscillations in minimum umbral intensity and maximum magnetic field , do exist .",
    "this claim is further supported by who studied the ratio of the total daily sunspot area to the number of sunspots between 1874 to 2004 .",
    "this ratio exhibited a prominent periodicity consistent and in phase with the solar cycle . both of these claims may point to an amplification phase of the toroidal field strength followed by a decay phase .",
    "still , however , no change in the generated size distribution , as described by , has been found and the oscillations seen in this paper are not large enough to enact a significant change in the observed size spectrum .",
    "we express thanks to bill livingston for providing his infrared measurements for this work .",
    "thanks are also extended to harry jones with whom we discussed the operation and measurements of the kpvt spectromagnetograph and jack harvey for his careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions .",
    "the nso / kitt peak data used here were produced cooperatively by nsf / noao , nasa / gsfc and noaa / sec .",
    "this work was supported by the national solar observatory .",
