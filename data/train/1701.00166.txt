    "the high number of dengue , chikungunya and zika viral infections in brazil were a major cause for concern during rio de janeiro s 2016 olympic games .",
    "news reports on microcephalic newborns in the poor northern regions of the country alarmed the world and urged public health authorities to take action . since all such viruses are transmitted by the same disease vector , the moquito _ aedes aegypti _ ,",
    "a better understanding of which climate conditions favor their proliferation is crucial for vector - control strategies .",
    "we analyzed climate data from 7 brazilian state capitals and found that climate effects often occurring months before the outbreaks may be of critical importance for prediction .",
    "thus , the early incidence of key temperature and precipitation signatures  that vary from city to city  should urge municipal health authorities to anticipate early interventions and ensure adequate responses to the local climate conditions .",
    "dengue fever is a tropical mosquito - borne viral disease present in more than 110 countries and a current threat to half of the world population  @xcite .",
    "the denv virus  and the more perilous chikungunya and zika virus  are primarily transmitted to humans through infected _ aedes aegypti _ mosquitoes , which were the subject of much debate during the 2016 olympic games in rio de janeiro .",
    "this main disease vector is well adapted to urban environments , which allow viruses to spread easily through cities .",
    "still , regional climate conditions play a critical role in the development of epidemic outbreaks in major urban centers . in this work",
    "we analyze temperature and precipitation time series data for brazilian state capitals and determine critical periods and seasons in which these climate variables might favor the mosquito development cycle and therefore the occurrence of dengue outbreaks .    the first cases of dengue in brazil date from the end of the @xmath0 century , and despite the elimination of the _ aedes aegypti _ in 1955 , the mosquito was reintroduced in the country in the 70s .",
    "a historically important outbreak occurred in 1981 in boa vista , in the state of roraima , following several outbreaks in central america involving the denv-1 and denv-4 serotypes  @xcite .",
    "since then , dengue has become one of the major public health problems in brazil , with several epidemics reported yearly across the country .",
    "while dengue symptoms are usually limited to fever and muscle / joint pain , some develop more severe forms of the disease such as hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome .",
    "the epidemics were aggravated with the latest zika and chikungunya developments .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 thousand cases of zika and 39,017 thousand cases of chikungunya were reported in 2016 from february to april alone  @xcite , which caught the world s attention just in time for the olympic games in rio de janeiro . until recently , brazilian authorities limited their actions to vector control measures , but a first - generation vaccine may represent a turning point for stopping these epidemics   @xcite .",
    "the proliferation of _ aedes aegypti _ and the sustained transmission of dengue are influenced by a complex , interplay of multi - scale factors such as the circulation of different serotypes  @xcite , the commuting of infected and susceptible humans within a city  @xcite , and the population size of the mosquitoes .",
    "there is also a growing body of evidence showing that local climate conditions such as temperature and precipitation may highly influence the development of the mosquitoes throughout the different stages of their life cycle  @xcite .",
    "complicating our understanding is the fact that several regions experienced a nontrivial alternation between periods with and without epidemic outbreaks over the past years , suggesting that the specific critical climate conditions that propitiate the transmission of the disease is heterogeneous and still poorly understood   @xcite .",

    "may significantly improve dengue outbreak forecasting in the upcoming years .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in this work we analyze climate and epidemiological data from seven major brazilian cities that in the recent past had years with and without dengue outbreaks in order to identify critical climate signatures that may have contributed to the epidemic outcomes .",
    "figure  [ schematic_overview ] is a schematic overview of the work presented .",
    "we estimate the influence of climate conditions in different epochs preceding epidemic periods using two data - driven methodologies ; the first one is based of the singular value decomposition and exploits the low dimensional structures present in the climate time series  @xcite , and the second one is based of machine learning algorithms for clustering and classification  @xcite such as support vector machines ( svm ) applied to climate variables that are key to the life cycle of the mosquito  @xcite .",
    "a crucial step in our methodology includes the usage of compressed sensing to recover missing data  @xcite  in a plausible and in a @xmath3-optimal way  from climate recordings by the national institute of meteorology ( inmet )  @xcite .",
    "this allow us to explore the link between climate and dengue in the following major brazilian cities : aracaj , belo horizonte , manaus , recife , rio de janeiro , salvador and so lus .",
    "for each city , we highlight epochs that are critical for both methodologies .",
    "surprisingly , there is a strong correlation between dengue epidemics and favorable climate conditions during winter and spring .",
    "this long - term influence is important evidence that the interplay between climate , mosquito populations and dengue outbreaks are extremely complex .",
    "the insights of this work may help taylor public health policies for each different city by increasing vector control measures during neglected critical epochs and ultimately improving the forecasting of dengue outbreaks  which would allow the public health system to make earlier logistic preparations to better accommodate a large number of patients , or alternatively , mosquito eradication programs can be enacted during the winter and spring months that are known to be associated with epidemic outbreaks .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the * methods * section",
    ", we describe both epidemiological and climate datasets , our techniques for data completion and other details of our analysis . in the * results * section we present our findings for all seven brazilian capitals , emphasizing epochs that are critical for all methods . in the * discussion *",
    "section we summarize the most important seasons for dengue epidemics in each city , highlighting the long - term impact of climate .",
    "we also discuss the limitations of this work , its potential impact for improving early warning systems , and the usage of our methods as a modest outbreak prediction tool .",
    "all epidemiological data utilized in this work were taken from the publicly available datasets of the brazilian notifiable diseases information system ( sinan ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this includes the total number of dengue cases per year ( from 2002 to 2012 ) for all brazilian state capitals .",
    "we also include data made available for rio de janeiro by the city s hall health department for 2013  @xcite . a year is conventionally classified as an _ epidemic _ year for a given city if the incidence of dengue is above 100 cases ( per 100,000 inhabitants ) and classified as a _ non - epidemic _ year otherwise . in order to find critical climate signatures that may have contributed to the epidemic outcomes , we restrict ourselves to seven state capitals that displayed at least 3 epidemic years and 3 non - epidemic years in the recent past .",
    "this allowed us to investigate the correlation between distinct climate conditions and the complicated alternations between years with and without epidemic outbreaks over time .",
    "the climate data utilized in this work was obtained from the national institute of meteorology ( inmet ) and included time series for the average temperature and precipitation for the state capitals aracaj , belo horizonte , manaus , recife , salvador , and so lus ( from 1/1/2001 to 12/31/2012 ) and for rio de janeiro ( from 1/1/2002 to 12/31/2013 ) .",
    "the time series of our selected climate dataset contain episodical gaps on days where variables ( temperature and precipitation ) were not recorded .",
    "to fill in the missing data gaps , we employ two different methods : compressive sensing  @xcite and interpolation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for illustrative examples ) . for temperature time series data with 2 or more consecutive missing recordings",
    ", we use a recently developed compressive sensing method based upon @xmath3-convex optimization for approximating the missing data  @xcite . the compressive sensing method attempts to reconstruct a signal from a sparse , subsampling of the time series data . in this case",
    ", the sparse subsampling occurs from the fact that we have missing data .",
    "the signal reconstruction problem is nothing more than a large underdetermined system of linear equations . to be more precise ,",
    "consider the conversion of a time series data to the frequency domain via the discrete cosine transform ( dct )    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the signal vector in the time domain and @xmath6 are the cosine transform coefficients representing the signal in the dct domain .",
    "the matrix @xmath7 represents the dct transform itself .",
    "the key observation is that most of the coefficients of the vector @xmath6 are zero , i.e. the time series is sparse in the fourier domain .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath7 is of size @xmath8 while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath9 vectors .",
    "the choice of basis functions is critical in carrying out the compressed sensing protocol .",
    "in particular , the signal must be sparse in the chosen basis .",
    "for the example here of a cosine basis , the signal is clearly sparse , allowing us to accurately reconstruct the signal using sparse sampling .",
    "the idea is to now sample the signal randomly ( and sparsely ) so that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a few ( @xmath12 ) random samples of the original signal @xmath5 ( ideally @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus @xmath14 is a subset of randomly permuted rows of the identity operator .",
    "more complicated sampling can be performed , but this is a simple example that will illustrate all the key features .",
    "note here that @xmath11 is an @xmath15 vector while the matrix @xmath14 is of size @xmath16 .",
    "approximate signal reconstruction can then be performed by solving the linear system @xmath17 where @xmath11 is an @xmath15 vector , @xmath18 is @xmath9 vector and @xmath19 is a matrix of size @xmath16 . here",
    "the @xmath18 is the sparse approximation to the full dct coefficient vector .",
    "thus for @xmath13 , the resulting linear algebra problem is highly underdetermined .",
    "the idea is then to solve the underdetermined system using an appropriate norm constraint that best reconstructs the original signal , i.e. the sparsity promoting @xmath3 is highly appropriate .",
    "the signal reconstruction is performed by using @xmath20 if the original signal had exactly @xmath12 non - zero coefficients , the reconstruction could be made exact ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , ch .",
    "we applied this technique specifically to the climate series of rio de janeiro , salvador and so lus .",
    "for the other capitals , we just linearly interpolate the time series whenever a single daily recording is missing .",
    "we note that there were intractable large gaps for the inmet precipitation series for rio de janeiro , which forced us to use alternative data sources made available by the city s alert system of rain events  @xcite .",

    "we let _ @xmath21 _",
    "denote a sampling period of @xmath2 days starting at the date @xmath22 .",
