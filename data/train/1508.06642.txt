    "0.13 cm 0.13 cm    the relationship between mathematics and physics has a long history .",
    "traditionally , mathematics provides the language physicists use to describe nature , while physics brings mathematics to life : to discover the laws of mechanics , newton needed to develop calculus .",
    "the very idea of a precise physical law , and mathematics to describe it were born together . to unify gravity and special relativity ,",
    "einstein needed the language of riemannian geometry .",
    "he used known mathematics to discover new physics .",
    "general relativity has been inspiring developments in differential geometry ever since .",
    "quantum physics impacted many branches of mathematics , from geometry and topology to representation theory and analysis , extending the pattern of beautiful and deep interactions between physics and mathematics throughout centuries .",
    "0.13 cm string theory brings something new to the table : the phenomenon of duality .",
    "duality is the equivalence between two descriptions of the same quantum physics in different classical terms . ordinarily , we start with a classical system and quantize it , treating quantum fluctuations as small",
    ". however , nature is intrinsically quantum .",
    "one can obtain the same quantum system from two distinct classical starting points .",
    "for every precise question in one description of the theory , there is a corresponding question in the dual description .",
    "duality is similar to a change of charts on a manifold , except it also has the power to map large fluctuations in one description to small fluctuations in the dual , and relate very hard mathematical problems in one are of mathematics to more manageable ones in another .",
    "dualities are pervasive in string theory .",
    "0.13 cm understanding dualities requires extracting their mathematical predictions and proving the huge set of mathematical conjectures that follow .",
    "the best understood duality is _",
    "mirror symmetry_. but , mirror symmetry is but one example ",
    "many striking dualities have been discovered in quantum field theory ( qft ) and many more in string theory over the last 20 years .",
    "duality gives quantum physics , and especially string theory , the power to unify disparate areas of mathematics in surprising ways and provides a basis for a long lasting and profound relationship between the physics and mathematics .",
    "to illustrate these ideas , i will pick one particular area of mathematics , knot theory .",
    "the central question of knot theory is : when are two knots ( or links ) distinct ?",
    "a knot is an oriented closed loop in @xmath0 .",
    "a link consists of several disjoint , possibly tangled knots .",
    "two knots are considered equivalent , if they are homotopic to each other .",
    "one approaches the question by constructing knot or link invariants , which depend on the knot up to homotopy .",
    "knot theory was born out of 19th century physics .",
    "gauss study of electromagnetism resulted in the first link invariant : the gauss linking number , which is an invariant of a link with two knot components , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "one picks a projection of the link onto a plane and defines ( twice ) the linking number as the number of crossings ,    counted with signs :    @xmath3    gauss discovered the linking number , and gave a beautiful integral formula for it : @xmath4 maxwell discovered it independently , some time later , and noted that it is not a very good link invariant  it is easy to find links that are non - trivial , yet the invariant vanishes .",
    "note that , while the first formula for the linking number relies on a choice of a projection , the second one makes it manifest one is studying a link in three dimensional space .",
    "strikingly , quantum physics enters knot theory . in @xmath5 ,",
    "vaughan jones found a very good polynomial invariant of knots and links , by far the best at the time , depending on one variable @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the jones polynomial is a laurent polynomial in @xmath7 ; it can be computed in a simple way by describing how it changes as we reconnect the strands and change the knot .",
    "one picks a planar projection of the knot , and a neighborhood of a crossing .    and defines the value of the jones polynomial by the skein relation it satisfies :    @xmath8 together with specifying its value for the unknot .",
    "while there are examples of distinct knots with the same @xmath9 , there is no known examples of non - trivial knots with @xmath9 the same as for the unknot . despite the ease of construction",
    ", the jones polynomial seems mysterious .",
    "since one has to pick a projection to a plane to define it , it is not obvious at the outset that one obtains an invariant of knots in three dimensional space , rather this is something one must prove .",
    "secondly , what is the meaning of @xmath6 ?",
    "witten discovered that the jones polynomial has its origin in quantum field theory : chern - simons ( cs ) gauge theory in three dimensions . like yang - mills theory , chern - simons theory on a three - manifold @xmath10 is written in terms of a connection @xmath11 associated with a gauge group @xmath12 .",
    "the theory is topological from the outset  its classical action is given in terms of chern - simons form on @xmath10 , @xmath13 and hence it is independent of the choice of metric on @xmath10 .",
    "the path integral of the theory @xmath14 where one integrates over spaces of all connections on @xmath10 and divides by the gauge group is a topological invariant of @xmath10 .",
    "we can introduce a knot @xmath15 in the theory by inserting a line observable along @xmath15 , @xmath16 in some representation @xmath17 of the gauge group ( @xmath18 denotes path ordering of the exponential ) .",
    "this preserves topological invariance , so @xmath19 is a topological invariant of the knot @xmath15 in the three manifold @xmath10 , which depends only on @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath20 ( more precisely , chern - simons theory produces an invariant of a framed three - manifold @xmath10 , with framed knots .",
    "framing is a choice of a homotopy class of trivialization of the tangent bundle of @xmath10 and @xmath15 . the need to fix the framing reflects an ambiguity in the phase the partition function @xcite . )",
    "the constant @xmath21 is required to be an integer , for the integrand to be invariant under `` large '' gauge transformations , those corresponding to non - trivial elements of @xmath22 .",
    "witten made use of the topological invariance of the theory to solve chern - simons theory exactly on an arbitrary three manifold @xmath10 with collection of knots , by cutting the three manifold into pieces , solving the theory on pieces and gluing back together .",
    "he showed that , taking @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the defining two dimensional representation of @xmath25 , a suitably normalized chern - simons partition function @xmath26 equals the jones polynomial @xmath27 the normalization we chose corresponds to setting @xmath28 .",
    "chern - simons theory gave a manifestly three dimensional formulation of the jones polynomial .",
    "it leads immediately to a vast generalization of jones knot invariant , by varying the gauge group @xmath12 , the representations , and considering knots in an arbitrary three manifold @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the relation to chern - simons theory showed that the jones polynomial is a quantum invariant : it is a laurent polynomial in @xmath29 where @xmath30 plays the role of @xmath31 , the planck constant , in chern - simons theory .",
    "let me pause for a moment to sketch what one means by saying the theory is solvable @xcite .",
    "it is known that every three manifold @xmath10 can be related to @xmath32 by a repeated application of surgery . a surgery to produce from @xmath10 a new three manifold proceeds as follows .",
    "one picks an imaginary knot in @xmath10 , cuts out its solid torus neighborhood , and glues it back in up to an @xmath33 transformation of the boundary .",
    "if @xmath34 is not identity one obtains a new manifold @xmath35 .",
    "quantum field theory is a functor that associates to a closed three manifold @xmath10 a complex number @xmath36 , the value of the path integral on @xmath10 , and to a manifold with a boundary @xmath37 a state in the vector space @xmath38 , the hilbert space of the theory based on @xmath37 .",
    "vector spaces associated to the same @xmath37 , with opposite orientation , are canonically dual .",
    "gluing two manifolds over a common boundary @xmath37 is the inner product of the corresponding states .",
    "so surgery on three manifolds translates to a following statement in qft : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the state corresponding to solid torus with no insertions , and @xmath41 the state corresponding to @xmath35 with a neighborhood of the knot @xmath15 cut out .",
    "an arbitrary state in @xmath42 can be obtained from a solid torus with a line observable colored by a representation @xmath17 running through it .",
    "if we denote the resulting state @xmath43 , we can write @xmath44 the sum runs over a finite set of representations of @xmath12 , depending on @xmath21 .",
    "( the hilbert space @xmath45 of chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath12 at level @xmath21 is the same as the space of conformal blocks of @xmath46 wzw model ; the latter is finite dimensional for any @xmath37 . )",
    "this implies @xmath47 where @xmath48 corresponds to the partition function on @xmath35 with an actual knot @xmath15 colored by representation @xmath17 running through it . in this way , by repeated surgeries , we can reduce any three manifold invariant to that of @xmath32 with a braid running along the @xmath49 . in turn",
    ", the later can be computed by @xmath50 which comes about by first cutting the @xmath32 open into @xmath51 , straightening the braid out , and then recovering the original braid by finding a collection @xmath52 of time - ordered diffeomeorphisms of a sphere @xmath53 with marked points , which re - braid the braid . gluing the ends together",
    "corresponds to taking the trace of @xmath52 , acting on the hilbert space @xmath54 of the theory on @xmath53 with marked points colored by representations @xmath55 determined by the braid .    to solve the theory one needs only a finite set of data .",
    "the @xmath56 transformations of the torus are generated by a pair of matrices , @xmath57 and @xmath58 satisfying @xmath59 representing the action of @xmath60 on @xmath42 . similarly , the brading matrix @xmath52 from is obtained from a finite set of data , the braiding matrix @xmath37 and fusion matrix @xmath61 on a four punctured sphere @xcite . for chern - simons theory based on gauge group @xmath12 , at level @xmath21 , the @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath37 and @xmath61",
    "are finite dimensional matrices acting on conformal blocks of@xmath46 wzw 2d cft .",
    "reshetikhin and turaev formalized this in terms of modular tensor categories @xcite .",
    "thus , one can reduce finding knot and three manifold invariants for arbitrary @xmath12 and @xmath21 and representations @xmath17 to matrix multiplication , of a small set of matrices .",
    "quantum physics enters modern mathematics in other places as well . _",
    "gromov - witten theory _ is an example .",
    "there , one studies quantum intersection theory of a projective variety @xmath62 ( see @xcite for a review , and @xcite for a quick overview ) .",
    "classical intersection corresponds to picking classes @xmath63 with degrees @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and computing their intersection numbers , counted with signs : @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the poincare dual of @xmath68 .",
    "enumerative geometry turns this into a deeper geometric question by counting intersections over algebraic curves , insead over points : one would like to know how many algebraic curves of a give degree @xmath69 and genus @xmath70 meet @xmath71 at points .",
    "the corresponding invariant @xmath72 can be defined by picking a curve @xmath73 of genus @xmath70 , with @xmath74 marked points @xmath75 , ",
    "@xmath76 , and considering intersection theory on the moduli space @xmath77 of holomorphic maps @xmath78 of degree @xmath79 .",
    "more precisely , as explained by kontsevich , one needs consider _ moduli space of stable maps _ @xmath80 .",
    "this is a compactification of @xmath77 by allowing the domain curve @xmath81 to have `` ears '' , which are additional @xmath53 that bubble off , and considering _ stable maps _ , which he defined . imposing the incidence condition that @xmath82 is implemented by pulling back the poincare dual class @xmath83 via the evaluation map @xmath84 .",
    "the evaluation map maps a point in the moduli space of maps to @xmath85 :    @xmath86 } \\;{\\rm ev}_1^*(\\gamma_1^{\\vee})\\cdots { \\rm ev}_n^*(\\gamma_n^{\\vee}),\\ ] ]    where the brackets @xmath87 $ ] denote the ( virtual ) fundamental class . for genus zero ,",
    "degree zero curves , the definition agrees with the classical intersection numbers in . at genus zero , it is natural to combine the classical answer and the higher degree data into a generating function of quantum intersection numbers of @xmath62 ,    @xmath88    for a map of degree @xmath89 to @xmath62 , @xmath90 is the exponent the area of the target curve , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the kahler form on @xmath62 .",
    "the leading term in the series is the classical intersection , and the subleading terms are quantum corrections to it .",
    "gromov - witten theory originates from string theory .",
    "it computes the amplitudes of a topological variant of superstring theory , called the _ a - model topological string_.    in quantum field theory , to describe a particle propagating on a manifold @xmath62 one sums over all maps from graphs @xmath93 to @xmath62 , satisfying certain conditions , where one allows moduli of graph to vary . in string theory , we replace point particles by strings , the maps from graphs @xmath93 by maps from riemann surfaces @xmath73 to @xmath62 . in superstring theory ,",
    "one formulates this in terms of a path integral of a supersymmetric 2d qft on @xmath73 , describing a string propagating on @xmath62 . to get topological string theory",
    "one modifies the supersymmetry generator @xmath94 to square to zero , @xmath95 on arbitrary @xmath73 .",
    "this turns the 2d qft into a topological quantum field theory on @xmath73 of cohomological type , with differential @xmath94 .",
    "the world sheet path integral receives contributions only from configurations that are annihilated by @xmath94 . if @xmath62 is a calabi - yau manifold , there are are two inequivalent ways to obtain a tqft , leading to topological @xmath96- and the @xmath37-model string theories .",
    "they correspond to two distinct generators @xmath97 and @xmath98 , each satisfying @xmath99 .",
    "topological @xmath96-type string exists for any kahler manifold @xmath62 . restricting to configurations annihilated by @xmath97",
    "turns out to restrict one to studying holomorphic maps to @xmath62 only , leading to gromov - witten theory . in the b - model ,",
    "the maps annihilated by @xmath98 are the constant maps , resulting in a simpler theory , depending on complex structure of @xmath62 only .",
    "topological string theory was introduced by witten in @xcite , and developed by many ( see for e.g. @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the mathematical formulation of gromov - witten theory is due to kontsevich , manin , fukaya and many others @xcite .",
    "the development of gromov - witten theory is an example of new mathematics that is inspired by questions in physics .",
    "a quantum system is described by a collection of observables @xmath100 , corresponding to physical quantities in the theory , and expectation values of these observables , @xmath101 which physicists call amplitudes , or correlation functions . in chern - simons theory",
    ", the observables ended up associated to knots in a three manifold @xmath10 , colored by representations @xmath17 of the gauge group ; in gromov - witten theory , the observables were related to homology classes @xmath68 in @xmath62 .    to find the correlation functions ,",

    "the description we are giving assumes quantum fluctuations are small .",
    "this opens up a possibility for the same physical system to have different descriptions , with different starting classical points , yet which result in the same set of quantum amplitudes .",
