    "in fact , the experimental information on @xmath2 was scarce until recently : the early data samples from fopi @xcite allowed the identification of @xmath2 s via the invariant mass distribution of @xmath15 pairs in restricted phase - space regions for the reactions ni ( 1.93 agev ) + ni and ru ( 1.69 agev ) + ru .",
