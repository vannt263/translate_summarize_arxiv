    "explaining the recent cosmic acceleration , believed to be related to some form of dark energy , and supported by the observations of high redshift supernovae and by other independent observational data , such as the results coming from cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and with baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) , is one of the present day challenges in cosmology . among the many possible proposals ( for recent reviews ,",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and also references therein ) , possibly a cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) is the simplest answer to explain the late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "of course , this also brings some theoretical difficulties , which are how to explain its origin , right magnitude and why it comes to dominate just now .    just like the early - time cosmic acceleration associated with inflation ,",
    "a negative pressure can be seen as a possible driving mechanism for the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe as well .",
    "one of the earliest alternatives that could provide a mechanism producing such accelerating phase of the universe is through a negative pressure produced by viscous or particle production effects .",
    "for instance , one of the first works relating particle production , in particular as a result of a nonstationary gravitational field and that can be described phenomenologically by means of a negative pressure , is due to zeldovich  @xcite .",
    "this is much similar to the idea put forward by murphy  @xcite and also later by hu  @xcite , that particle production might also be described equivalently in terms of a bulk viscous pressure in the cosmological fluid . in this context , since a bulk viscous pressure is a negative pressure contribution in the energy - momentum stress tensor  @xcite , it has lead to an extensive literature on applications related to bulk viscous cosmology ( for a partial sample of the earliest works on bulk viscous cosmologies , see for example refs .",
    "in addition , more recently , there has also been a surge of interest in exploring the effects of the bulk pressure as the origin of the present accelerated expansion of the universe ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "a closed related scenario to the bulk viscous cosmology is that of the so - called adiabatic matter creation , which makes use of ideas of the thermodynamics of open systems in the context of cosmology and initiated by prigogine and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "a covariant formalism approach has later been formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite the fact that bulk viscous and matter creation cosmologies apparently look similar , they have some fundamental differences .",
    "bulk viscous cosmologies are associated with a generalization of the hydrodynamics of ideal fluids for the case of nonideal ones , with constitutive equations describing the viscous pressures built as additional correction terms to the equilibrium energy - momentum stress tensor  @xcite . as such",
    ", the viscous pressure contributions can be seen as small nonequilibrium contributions for the energy - momentum tensor for nonideal fluids .",
    "it happens , however , that most of the effects of a bulk viscous pressure to cosmology , as for example when it is used as a mechanism for inflation , it typically requires an extrapolation beyond the limit of validity for these theories  @xcite ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the context of matter creation , even though also a negative effective pressure can be associated with it , there is in principle no such limitation as with a negative bulk viscous pressure .",
    "particle creation models  @xcite , as the one treated in this work , should also not be confused with other cosmological scenarios where particle production is present , like , e.g. , in warm inflation  @xcite . in warm inflation models",
    "the inflationary evolution can be strongly influenced by relativistic ( radiation ) particle production . in these models there",
    "can also be negative pressure effects as a result of a bulk viscous pressure from the radiation bath , but these effects are in general small in the inflationary context  @xcite .",
    "many authors have explored scenarios of matter creation in cosmology , but here we are particularly interested in the gravitationally induced particle creation scenario denominated `` creation of cold dark matter '' ( ccdm ) @xcite in which a special choice of the particle production rate produces a cosmology that , at the background level , is indistinguishable from the standard @xmath1 cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) model . however , as we are going to discuss in this paper , at the perturbative level this degeneracy is more subtle and care should be taken when contrasting ccdm predictions with those obtained in the standard @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "furthermore , perturbations in the case of ccdm cosmology have mostly been studied in the context of the so - called neo - newtonian formalism  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , here we will show that this formalism for studying density perturbations has limitations and a fully relativistic one ( like that , for example , of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is required in the case in which the effective speed of sound can not be neglected .",

    "let us briefly review here the thermodynamics of matter creation . for simplicity , we will restrict to the case of a single fluid , but it can easily be generalized to multiple coupled fluids as well . to describe the thermodynamic states of a relativistic simple fluid we use the following macroscopic variables : the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 ; the particle flux vector @xmath3 ; and the entropy flux vector @xmath4 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor satisfies the conservation law , @xmath5 , and here we consider situations in which it has the perfect - fluid form    @xmath6    in the above equation @xmath7 is the energy density , @xmath8 is the isotropic dynamical pressure , @xmath9 is the metric tensor and @xmath10 is the fluid four - velocity ( with normalization @xmath11 ) .",
    "the dynamical pressure @xmath8 is decomposed as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the equilibrium ( thermostatic ) pressure and @xmath14 is a term present in scalar dissipative processes .",
    "usually , it is associated with the so - called bulk pressure  @xcite . in the cosmological context , besides this meaning , @xmath14 can also be relevant when particle number is not conserved  @xcite . in this case , @xmath15 is called the `` creation pressure '' .",
    "it is important to mention that , the bulk pressure , as already mentioned in the introduction , can be seen as a correction to the thermostatic pressure when near to equilibrium , thus , it should be always smaller than the thermostatic pressure , @xmath16 .",
    "this restriction , however , does not apply for the creation pressure .",
    "so , when we have matter creation , the total pressure @xmath8 may become negative and , in principle , drive an accelerated expansion .",
    "the particle flux vector is assumed to have the following form    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the particle number density .",
    "@xmath3 satisfies the balance equation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the particle production rate .",
    "if @xmath21 , we have particle creation , particle destruction occurs when @xmath22 and if @xmath23 particle number is conserved .",
    "the entropy flux vector is given by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the specific ( per particle ) entropy .",
    "note that the entropy must satisfy the second law of thermodynamics @xmath26 .",
    "here we consider adiabatic matter creation , that is , we analyze situations in which @xmath27 is constant . with this condition , by using the gibbs relation , it follows that the creation pressure is related to @xmath20 by  @xcite ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter , @xmath30 is the scale factor of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric [ see eq .",
    "( [ frw ] ) below ] and the overdot means differentiation with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that , if @xmath27 is constant , the second law of thermodynamics implies that @xmath31 and , as a consequence , particle destruction ( @xmath22 ) is thermodynamically forbidden  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath32 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) that , in an expanding universe ( @xmath33 ) , the creation pressure @xmath34 can not be positive .",
    "before we discuss the evolution of linear perturbations in cosmological models with matter creation , we first consider their background equations . by assuming spatial homogeneity and isotropy , which is a good approximation at large scales , we are lead to the frw line element ,    @xmath35\\ , .",

    "we also assume flat space ( @xmath38 ) , which is in good agreement with cmbr observations .",
    "in this paper we are mainly interested in processes that occurred after radiation domination .",
    "therefore , as a first approximation , we neglect radiation and , for the sake of simplicity , we also neglect baryons considering only the presence ( and creation ) of pressureless ( @xmath39 ) dark matter particles .",
    "the einstein equations for the models we consider can be expressed simply as    @xmath40    @xmath41    to the above equations we add eq .",

    "( [ h2 ] ) , the dark matter energy density can be written as    @xmath60\\ , .",
    "\\label{rho2}\\ ] ]    as remarked above , the ccdm model mimics exactly the @xmath1cdm background expansion history , so we should expect good accordance of this model with kinematic cosmological tests like from supernovae type ia ( snia ) and bao , that essentially depend only on distances and , thus , does not depend on the perturbation results .",
    "does this mimicry remains at the perturbation level ?",
    "answering this question is somewhat subtle and we will discuss it in sec .",
    "[ ccdm ] .",
    "another point to be stressed here is that , although in ccdm we have a kind of unification of the dark sector , it does not solve or alleviate the so - called cosmological constant problems .",
    "for instance , the old cosmological constant problem is not solved since , like in quintessence , @xmath1 is assumed to be zero from the beginning .",
    "of course we hope that this problem will be resolved in the context of quantum field theory and not by cosmology . however , the fine - tuning and the cosmic coincidence problems are essentially the same as in @xmath1cdm . to better understand this",
    ", we now write the total dark matter energy density @xmath61 as    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the conserved part of the dark matter energy density and @xmath64 is the created one .",
    "the cosmological problems can now be cast as follows : why was the created ( and constant ) part so small ( as compared to the energy densities of other fields ) and finely adjusted in the beginning of the universe evolution ?",
    "why only at recent times are the conserved and the created ( and constant ) dark matter energy densities comparable ?",
    "therefore , ccdm model has essentially the same conceptual difficulties as @xmath1cdm .",
    "indeed , from the theoretical point of view the situation is even worse in ccdm .",
    "although some authors ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) try to motivate the ccdm scenario in terms of gravitational particle production in an expanding universe , currently there is no fundamental basis for the chosen particle production rate and we can only treat ccdm as a phenomenological model . in this context",
    ", we adopt a more pragmatic approach and , in the following sections , we discuss if observations that depend on the growth of perturbations can distinguish ccdm from @xmath1cdm .",
    "if yes , the ccdm model can be tested .",
    "if it produces results that are not compatible with the observations , then it can be discarded from the beginning .",
    "if the results are better than the ones produced with the @xmath1cdm , then we can pursue further and look more closely for the microscopic motivations for the model . however ,",
    "if the ccdm and @xmath1cdm are observationally degenerated with each other , then we must resort to the occam s razor principle to guide us .",
    "accordingly , the simplest model ( i.e. , @xmath1cdm ) becomes preferable unless further theoretical developments change the current situation .",
    "we now turn our attention to the growth of linear perturbation in matter creation models . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we first consider it in the neo - newtonian context .",
    "the idea of a newtonian expanding universe was developed by milne  @xcite and also by mccrea and milne  @xcite in the 1930 s . by considering a pressureless fluid and assuming newtonian dynamics and gravitation",
    ", it was shown that the governing newtonian differential equations are identical in form to the relativistic ones .",
    "this approach , known as newtonian cosmology ( nc ) , is quite helpful in giving insight into the physical significance of an expanding universe .",
    "the nc equations were generalized to include uniform pressure by mccrea  @xcite in a paper in which the hypothesis of continuous creation of matter was investigated .",
    "the same equations were reobtained later in ref .",
    "@xcite in a different context . however , as pointed out in ref .",

    "( iii ) _ measurements of the hubble parameter at different redshifts _  for this observable we use the same data set and procedure as described in ref .",
    "@xcite and we obtain @xmath145 .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , besides the result for the @xmath133 test ( solid curve ) , we also display the one - dimensional pdf for @xmath55 for each background test : cmb / bao ( dotted curve ) , sneia ( dashed curve ) and ohd ( dash - dotted curve ) .",
    "we also display in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( right panel ) the @xmath55 one - dimensional pdf for the combined @xmath133 plus the three background tests , which gives @xmath146 .    at this point",
    "it is important to make the following remark .",
    "if we have considered @xmath147 , instead of eq .",
    "( [ delta_a ] ) , we would get from eq .",
    "( [ rdelta ] ) the following differential equation    @xmath148    it can be shown that below the jeans length , @xmath149 , the @xmath78 dependence of the last term in the left - hand side of the above equation can cause strong oscillations if @xmath150 , or exponential growth if @xmath151 . only models with @xmath152 are acceptable at linear scales .",
    "an interesting question , but that is beyond the scope of this paper , is to estimate upper limits that will be imposed on @xmath81 by future surveys like euclid .    in our approximation",
    ", we have not considered the presence of baryons .",
    "if we had taken them into account , still assuming @xmath153 , it can be shown that their density contrast has the same dependence with redshift as clustered dark matter ( given by eq .",
    "( [ deltam ] ) ) . since the dependence with redshift of both energy densities is also the same , it will not be possible to distinguish the ccdm scenario from @xmath1cdm , by using measurements of the gas mass fraction in clusters @xcite , as suggested in ref .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the ccdm scenario as a possible explanation for the late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "we have compared the relativistic and neo - newtonian differential equations for the density contrast for the ccdm model .",
    "both relativistic and neo - newtonian cases agree with each other only when the effective sound speed @xmath81 is equal to zero .",
    "we have argued that even in the more general case , in which @xmath81 is considered nonvanishing , but the momentum dependent term in the equation for the density contrast is neglected , a somewhat common consideration assumed by some authors , that this is also not a consistent approximation for the density contrast differential equation .",
    "this approximation of neglecting the momentum dependent term is only justifiable in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath38 ) , which is in turn exactly the case where the newtonian approximation is not valid .",
    "thus , the neo - newtonian approach is not consistent with the full relativistic equations when @xmath154 , and the newtonian approximation is not valid in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "next , we have compared the ccdm predictions at the perturbative level with those obtained from the @xmath155 .",
    "we have used for this comparison redshift - space - distortion observational data .",
    "we have shown that the ccdm model produces results for the parameter @xmath55 ( that at the background level plays the role of the cosmological constant density parameter ) that are fully consistent with the ones expected from @xmath155 .",
    "independent tests were also carried out at the background level .",
    "these tests show that the result for @xmath55 predicted by the ccdm models is also consistent with the result from @xmath1cdm .",
    "we pointed out that this consistency with the @xmath1cdm can only be achieved when we properly identify the clustering part ( @xmath156 ) of the density contrast , as analyzed and argued in sec .",
    "this subtle issue concerning the density contrast may be related to the difficulties with the ccdm model found in previous works .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have found that ccdm models tend to overestimate peculiar velocities of galaxies in the linear regime .",
    "they have also found that because the density contrast today , obtained from the @xmath1cdm model , tends to be higher than the one predicted by the ccdm , that this would result also in an overestimate of the present density of massive galaxies clusters in these alternative models .",
    "this result comes as a consequence of the density contrast suppression as we increase @xmath55 and shown in the previous section .",
    "however , this difficult is no longer present when the clustering part @xmath156 is used instead . as pointed out in sec .  [ ccdm ] , the matter in ccdm clusters exactly in the same manner as it does in @xmath1cdm , since the gravitational potential is the same .    in summary , we have shown that ccdm models with @xmath94 are degenerate with @xmath1cdm not only at the background level , but also at the linear perturbative level .",
    "we can generally expect this degeneracy to remain at higher order .",
    "although @xmath1cdm has several conceptual problems ( smallness of @xmath1 , cosmic coincidence problem , etc ) , the ccdm model does not solve any of them either .",
    "therefore , in the absence of a more fundamental microscopic basis for the particles creation rate and that originates the specific ccdm model treated here , @xmath1cdm is a simpler alternative to explain observations ( occam s razor ) .",
