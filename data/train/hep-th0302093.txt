    "in integrable quantum field theory ( qft ) , the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba )  @xcite continues to be an important method for the study of massive and massless renormalization group ( rg ) flows including the study of excited states  @xcite .",
    "moreover the tricritical ising model ( tim ) , which is the simplest member @xmath0 of the unitary minimal series  @xcite beyond the critical ising model @xmath6 , remains a rich example for studying both thermal and boundary flows  @xcite .    in part",
    "i of this series ( hereafter referred to as pcai  @xcite ) we considered the massive tricritical ising model @xmath0 perturbed by the thermal operator @xmath1 in a cylindrical geometry and systematically derived the tba equations for all excitations by using a lattice approach .",
    "more specifically this was achieved by solving , in the continuum scaling limit , the tba functional equation satisfied by the double - row transfer matrices of the @xmath3 lattice model of andrews , baxter and forrester ( abf ) in regime  iii  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we turn our attention to the massless tricritical ising model which is obtained as the continuum scaling limit of the @xmath3 lattice model in regime  iv .",
    "our goal is to systematically derive and study the massless tba equations which describe the renormalization group ( rg ) flow from the tricritical @xmath0 to critical @xmath6 ising model .",
    "we apply the methods developed in pcai and use the concepts and notations introduced in that paper without further elaboration .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we discuss the classification of excitations using @xmath4 systems including a description of the three mechanisms by which the string contents change along the flow . in section  3",
    "we derive in detail the massless tba equations in the @xmath7 vacuum sector .",
    "we do not discuss the very similar derivation of the tba equations in the other 5 sectors .",
    "the numerical solution of the tba equations to yield continuous flows is discussed in section  4 .",
    "we finish in section  5 with a brief discussion .",
    "for small perturbations , the scaling limit of the excitations in regime  iv of the @xmath3 lattice model are classified by precisely the same @xmath4 systems  @xcite as at the conformal critical point  @xcite and throughout the massive regime  iii  @xcite . unlike the massive case",
    ", however , we find that in the massless regime the string content can change by one of three mechanisms along the flow .",
    "this was first observed empirically by direct numerical diagonalization of a sequence of finite - size transfer matrices approaching the scaling limit @xmath8 for modest values of the system size @xmath9 and @xmath10 and is confirmed by our numerical solutions of the tba equations . here",
    "@xmath11 measures the perturbation strength and @xmath12 is the departure - from - criticality variable .",
    "the mass @xmath13 and continuum length scale @xmath14 usually occur in the single combination @xmath15 .",
    "notice that in the finite - size scaling we use the regime  iii correlation length exponent @xmath16 even though the actual  @xcite correlation length exponent in regime  iv is @xmath17 .",
    "let us consider the vacuum sector with boundary condition @xmath7 .",
    "the excitation energies are given by the scaling limit of the eigenvalues of the double - row transfer matrix @xmath18 , or equivalently the normalized transfer matrix @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the spectral parameter .",
    "the two relevant analyticity strips in the complex @xmath20-plane are respectively @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the crossing parameter .",
    "the excitations are classified by their string contents @xmath23 at the conformal critical point ( @xmath24 ) the string contents satisfy the @xmath4 system @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath9 are even , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the @xmath31 incidence matrix with entries @xmath32 . for the leading excitations @xmath33",
    "are finite but @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "as explained in pcai , an excitation with string content @xmath4 is uniquely labelled by a set of quantum numbers @xmath36 where the integers @xmath37 with @xmath38 give the number of 2-strings whose imaginary parts @xmath39 are greater than that of the given 1-string @xmath40 .",
    "the 1-strings @xmath41 and 2-strings @xmath42 labelled by @xmath43 are closest to the real axis .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath44 satisfy @xmath45 for given string content @xmath4 , the lowest excitation occurs when all of the 1-strings are further out from the real axis than all of the 2-strings . in this case",
    "all of the quantum numbers vanish @xmath46 . bringing the location of a 1-string closer to the real axis by interchanging the location of the 1-string with a 2-string increments its quantum number by one unit and increases the energy .",
    "although we do not make use of it here , we mention in passing that , for the tricritical ising model , there exists a bijection  @xcite between the patterns of 1- and 2-strings classifying the eigenvalues of the double - row transfer eigenvalues and rsos paths on @xmath3 .",
    "this has as a consequence that the finitized partition functions ( virasoro characters ) satisfy the same recursions  @xcite as the one - dimensional configurational sums of the corner transfer matrices ( ctms ) .",
    "let @xmath19 be the normalized double row transfer matrix as in pcai .",
    "in regime  iv the eigenvalues @xmath47 of @xmath19 are doubly periodic meromorphic functions in the period rectangle @xmath48 where @xmath49 is related to the departure - from - criticality variable @xmath12 by @xmath50 however , in regime  iv the @xmath3 lattice model also admits the symmetry @xmath51 so we can restrict ourselves further to the rectangle @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , this means that for @xmath53 the distinction between the two strips effectively disappears  the two are joined along the scaling edge at @xmath54 in the scaling limit ( [ scalinglimit ] ) .",
    "this allows zeros to move between the putative strips  1 and 2 by crossing the scaling edge .",
    "the combination of strips  1 and 2 in the upper half plane into one extended strip is shown in figure  1 .",
    "there is a complex conjugation symmetry between the upper and lower half planes .",
    "note that this is consistent with the picture at the conformal point since in the limit @xmath55 the zeros are infinitely far below ( strip  1 ) or infinitely far above ( strip  2 ) the scaling edge as @xmath56 .     in the complex @xmath20-plane for the @xmath3 lattice model in regime",
    "iv showing the putative strips 1 and 2 .",
    "the schematic location of zeros reflects the complex conjugation symmetry and the symmetry ( [ xsymm ] ) . in the scaling limit the imaginary period @xmath56 and",
    "it is the behaviour of the zeros near the indicated scaling edge at @xmath54 that is relevant . ]",
    "let us consider the extended analyticity strip @xmath57 .",
    "empirically , we find that as @xmath15 is increased from @xmath58 the strip  1 zeros approach the scaling edge at @xmath54 from below while the strip  2 zeros approach the scaling edge from above . potentially , this allows zeros to collide or migrate from one strip to the other .",
    "in fact we find that the zero patterns change by one of the following three mechanisms which occur at the scaling edge :    1 .   if 1-strings are closest to the scaling edge in both strips  1 and 2 then these 1-strings collide and move symmetrically in opposite directions parallel to the scaling edge until they reach @xmath59 . at this point",
    "the two zeros no longer contribute and they can be removed from the analyticity strip . this mechanism applies if @xmath60 .",
    "2 .   if a 2-string is closest to the scaling edge in strip  2 and a 1-string is closest to the scaling edge in strip  1 then the 2-string moves to the scaling edge and leaves the analyticity strip .",
    "this mechanism applies if @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "3 .   otherwise ,",
    "if a 2-string is closest to the scaling edge in strip  1 , then this 2-string moves to the scaling edge and leaves the analyticity strip .",
    "this mechanism applies if @xmath63 .",
    "similar mechanisms are also observed  @xcite in the boundary flows of the tricritical ising model . if @xmath64 only mechanisms b and c apply according to whether @xmath61 or @xmath65 . if @xmath66 then mechanism c applies . in each of the three mechanisms",
    "exactly two zeros are removed from the extended analyticity strip .",
    "these three mechanisms are shown schematically in figure  2 .",
    "they are confirmed by the numerics discussed in section  4 .",
    "remarkably , as we explain in this subsection , the empirical rules giving the three mechanisms a , b , c for changing string contents under the flow suffice to determine a map in each sector @xmath2 between finitized characters for the uv ( @xmath24 , @xmath67 ) and ir ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) fixed points .",
    "since two zeros leave the analyticity strip under the flow , this map from the uv to ir takes the form @xmath70 we find that the primary operators @xmath2 of the tricritical ising model flow to the primary operators @xmath71 of the critical ising model as shown in table  1 .",
    "this pattern of flows is consistent with the flow of operators observed with periodic boundaries but , in the presence of a boundary , the flow is always to the primary operator not to an associated descendant as can occur in the periodic case .",

    "additional excitation energy is generated by permuting the order of 1-strings and 2-strings in each strip as dictated by the sum of quantum numbers @xmath133 in each strip and is given by the gaussian polynomials or @xmath5-binomials @xmath134 with the @xmath5-factorials @xmath135 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "explicitly , using the recursion ( [ qbinprops ] ) , we decompose it into three terms @xmath139 these three terms correspond precisely to the energy levels effected by mechanisms a , b and c respectively .",
