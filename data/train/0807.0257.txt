    "a typical problem of interest in this paper is the efficient representation of functions of elliptic linear operators such as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is smooth , and @xmath6 ^ 2 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have in mind the inverse , the square root , and the exponential of @xmath7 as important examples of functions of @xmath7 .",
    "while most numerical methods for inverting @xmath7 , say , would manipulate a right - hand side until convergence , and leverage sparsity or other properties of @xmath7 in doing so , the scope of this paper is quite different . indeed , we present expansions and iterative algorithms for manipulating operators as `` symbols '' , which make no or little reference to the functions of @xmath0 to which these operators may later be applied .",
    "the central question is of course that of choosing a tractable representation for differential and integral operators . if a function @xmath8 has @xmath2 degrees of freedom  if for instance it is sampled on @xmath2 points  then a direct representation of operators acting on @xmath8 would in general require @xmath9 degrees of freedom .",
    "there are many known methods for bringing down this count to @xmath10 or @xmath11 in specific cases , such as leveraging sparsity , computing convolutions via fft , low - rank approximations , fast summation methods @xcite , wavelet or x - let expansions @xcite , partitioned svd and h - matrices @xcite .",
    "the framework presented in this paper is different , in the sense that we aim for a complexity essentially independent of @xmath2 , i.e. , at most a low - degree polynomial of @xmath3 , for representing and combining operators belonging to standard classes . like the methods above ,",
    "the operator is `` compressed '' in such a way that applying it to functions remains simple ; it is only for this operation that the complexity needs to be greater than @xmath2 , in our case @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote a generic differential or singular integral operator , with kernel representation @xmath13 expanding the distributional kernel @xmath14 in some basis would be cumbersome because of the presence of a singularity along the diagonal @xmath15 . for this reason we choose to consider operators as _ pseudodifferential symbols _",
    "@xmath16 , by considering their action on the fourier transform ] ] @xmath17 of @xmath8 ; @xmath18 one often writes @xmath19 for @xmath7 , where @xmath20 . in this representation ,",
    "the singularities of @xmath14 are turned into the oscillating factor @xmath21 , which can be discounted by focusing on the symbol @xmath16 .",
    "the latter is usually smooth , and in a very peculiar way .",
    "it is the special form of the smoothness estimates for @xmath22which we now describe  that guarantees the efficiency of the discretizations proposed in this paper .",
    "a symbol defined on @xmath23 is said to be pseudodifferential of order @xmath24 ( and type @xmath25 ) if it obeys @xmath26 .",
    "this symbol class is denoted @xmath27 ; the operator corresponding to some @xmath22 in this class is denoted @xmath19 , and belongs by definition to the class @xmath28 .",
    "manifestly , one power of @xmath29 is gained for each differentiation , meaning that the larger @xmath29 , the smoother @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , the symbols of differential operators are polynomials in @xmath1 and obey ( [ eq : type10 ] ) when they have @xmath30 coefficients . large classes of singular integral operators also have symbols in the class @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the standard treatment of pseudodifferential operators makes the further assumption that some symbols can be represented as polyhomogeneous series , such as @xmath31 which defines the `` classical '' symbol class @xmath32 when the @xmath33 are of class @xmath30 .",
    "corresponding operators are said to be in the class @xmath34 . the series should be understood as an asymptotic expansion ; it converges only when adequate cutoffs smoothly removing the origin multiply each term .",
    "only then , the series does not converge to @xmath16 , but to an approximation that differs from @xmath22 by a smoothing remainder @xmath35 , smoothing in the sense that @xmath36 .",
    "for instance , an operator is typically transposed , inverted , etc .",
    "modulo a smoothing remainder @xcite .",
    "the subclass ( [ eq : classical ] ) is central for applications",
    " it is the cornerstone of theories such as geometrical optics  but the presence of remainders is a nonessential feature that should be avoided in the design of efficient numerical methods .",
    "the lack of convergence in ( [ eq : classical ] ) may be acceptable in the course of a mathematical argument , but it takes great additional effort to turn such series into accurate numerical methods ; see @xcite for an example . in a sense",
    ", the goal of this paper is to find adequate substitutes for ( [ eq : classical ] ) that promote asymptotic series into fast - converging expansions .",
    "there are in general no explicit formulas for the symbols of functions of an operator .",
    "fortunately , some results in the literature guarantee exact closedness of the symbol classes ( [ eq : type10 ] ) or ( [ eq : classical ] ) under inversion and taking the square root , without smoothing remainders . a symbol @xmath37 , or an operator @xmath38 , is said to be elliptic when there exists @xmath39 such that @xmath40    * it is a basic result that if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 .",
    "see for instance theorem 18.1.8 in @xcite , volume 3 .",
    "* it is also a standard fact that if @xmath43 , then its adjoint @xmath44 . *",
    "if @xmath45 , and @xmath7 is elliptic and invertible is a bijection from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , hence obeys @xmath48 .",
    "ellipticity , in the sense in which it is defined for symbols , obviously does not imply invertibility . ] on @xmath49 , then @xmath50 .",
    "this result was proved by shubin in 1978 in @xcite .",
    "* for the square root , we also assume ellipticity and invertibility .",
    "it is furthermore convenient to consider operators on compact manifolds , in a natural way through fourier transforms in each coordinate patch , so that they have discrete spectral expansions .",
    "a square root @xmath51 of an elliptic operator @xmath7 with spectral expansion @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are the spectral projectors , is simply @xmath54 with of course @xmath55 . in 1967 , seeley @xcite studied such expressions for elliptic @xmath56 , in the context of a much more general study of complex powers of elliptic operators . if in addition @xmath24 is an even integer , and an adequate choice of branch cut is made in the complex plane , then seeley showed that @xmath57 ; see @xcite for an accessible proof that involves the complex contour `` dunford '' integral reformulation of ( [ eq : as ] ) .",
    "we do not know of a corresponding closedness result under taking the square root , for the non - classical class @xmath28 . in practice",
    ", we will also manipulate operators that come from pde on bounded domains with certain boundary conditions ; the extension of the theory of pseudodifferential operators to bounded domains is a difficult subject that this paper has no ambition of addressing .",
    "let us also mention in passing that the exponential of an elliptic , non - self - adjoint pseudodifferential operator is not in general pseudodifferential itself .",
    "numerically , it is easy to check that smoothness of symbols is remarkably robust under inversion and taking the square root of the corresponding operators , as the following simple one - dimensional example shows .",
    "let @xmath58 on the periodic interval @xmath59 $ ] where @xmath60 is a random bandlimited function shown in figure [ fig : sec11](a ) .",
    "the symbol of this operator is @xmath61 which is of order 2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sec11](b ) , we plot the values of @xmath62 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 on a cartesian grid .    since @xmath7 is elliptic and invertible , its inverse @xmath63 and square root @xmath64 are both well defined .",
    "let use @xmath65 and @xmath66 to denote their symbols . from the above theorems , we know that the orders of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are respectively @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we do not believe explicit formulae exist for these symbols , but the numerical values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 are shown in figure [ fig : sec11](c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "these plots demonstrate regularity of these symbols in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 ; observe in particular the disproportionate smoothness in @xmath1 for large @xmath71 , as predicted by the class estimate ( [ eq : type10 ] ) .    [",

    "an interesting question is what form discrete symbol calculus should take when other boundary conditions than periodic are considered , or on more general domains than a square .",
    "one can speculate that the discrete sine transform ( dst ) should be used as @xmath72 for dirichlet boundary conditions on a rectangle , or the discrete cosine transform ( dct ) for neumann on a rectangle .",
    "whatever choice is made for @xmath72 should dictate the definition of the corresponding frequency variable @xmath1 .",
    "a more robust approach could be to use spectral elements for more complicated domains , where the spectral domain would be defined by chebyshev expansions .",
    "one may also imagine expansions in prolate spheroidal wavefunctions .",
    "regardless of the type of expansions chosen , the theory of pseudodifferential operators on bounded domains is a difficult topic that will need to be understood .",
    "another interesting problem is that of designing absorbing boundary conditions in variable media .",
    "we hope that the ideas of symbol expansions will provide new insights for this question .",
    "symbol - based methods may help solve other equations than elliptic pde .",
    "the heat equation in variable media comes to mind : its fundamental solution has a nice pseudodifferential smoothing form that can be computed via scaling - and - squaring .",
    "a more challenging example are hyperbolic systems in variable , smooth media .",
    "the time - dependent green s function of such systems is not a pseudodifferential operator , but rather a fourier integral operator ( fio ) , where @xmath73 needs to be replaced by @xmath74 .",
    "we regard the extension of discrete symbol calculus to handle such phases a very interesting problem , see @xcite for preliminary results on fast application of fio .",
    "as previously , write @xmath75 for the fourier series coefficients of @xmath16 in @xmath0",
    ". then we can express ( [ eq : psido - sum ] ) as @xmath76 we seek to interchange the two sums .",

    "if in addition we assume @xmath82 , then we can apply fubini s theorem and write @xmath83 where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the operator of multiplication by @xmath86 on the @xmath1 side . by plancherel ,",
    "we have @xmath87 therefore , by the triangle inequality , @xmath88 as we have seen , the sum over @xmath89 converges .",
