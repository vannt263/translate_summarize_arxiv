    "this work deals with the discretization of darcy flows in fractured porous media for which the fractures are modelized as interfaces of codimension one . in this framework ,",
    "the @xmath0 dimensional flow in the fractures is coupled with the @xmath1 dimensional flow in the matrix leading to the so called , hybrid dimensional darcy flow model .",
    "we consider the case for which the pressure can be discontinuous at the matrix fracture interfaces in order to account for fractures acting either as drains or as barriers as described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in this paper , we will study the family of models described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is also assumed in the following that the pressure is continuous at the fracture intersections .",
    "this corresponds to a ratio between the permeability at the fracture intersection and the width of the fracture assumed to be high compared with the ratio between the tangential permeability of each fracture and its length .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more general reduced model taking into account discontinuous pressures at fracture intersections in dimension @xmath2 .",
    "+ the discretization of such hybrid dimensional darcy flow model has been the object of several works . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite a cell - centered finite volume scheme using a two point flux approximation ( tpfa ) is proposed assuming the orthogonality of the mesh and isotropic permeability fields .",
    "cell - centered finite volume schemes have been extended to general meshes and anisotropic permeability fields using multipoint flux approximations ( mpfa ) in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in @xcite , a mixed finite element ( mfe )",
    "method is proposed and a mfe discretization adapted to non - matching fracture and matrix meshes is studied in @xcite .",
    "more recently the hybrid finite volume ( hfv ) scheme , introduced in @xcite , has been extended in @xcite for the non matching discretization of two reduced fault models .",
    "also a mimetic finite difference ( mfd ) scheme is used in @xcite in the matrix domain coupled with a tpfa scheme in the fracture network .",
    "discretizations of the related reduced model @xcite assuming a continuous pressure at the matrix fracture interfaces have been proposed in @xcite using a mfe method , in @xcite using a control volume finite element method ( cvfe ) , in @xcite using the hfv scheme , and in @xcite using an extension of the vertex approximate gradient ( vag ) scheme introduced in @xcite .    in terms of convergence analysis ,",
    "the case of continuous pressure models at the matrix fracture interfaces @xcite is studied in @xcite for a general fracture network but the current state of the art for the discontinuous pressure models at the matrix fracture interfaces is still limited to rather simple geometries .",
    "let us recall that the family of models introduced in @xcite and @xcite depends on a quadrature parameter denoted by @xmath3 $ ] for the approximate integration in the width of the fractures .",
    "existing convergence analysis for such models cover the case of one non immersed fracture separating the domain into two subdomains using a mfe discretization in @xcite or a non matching mfe discretization in @xcite for the range @xmath4 $ ] . in @xcite ,",
    "the case of one fully immersed fracture in dimension @xmath2 using a tpfa discretization is analysed for the full range of parameters @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "+ the main goal of this paper is to study the discretizations of such models and their convergence properties by extension of the gradient scheme framework .",
    "the gradient scheme framework has been introduced in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to analyse the convergence of numerical methods for linear and nonlinear second order diffusion problems . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "this framework accounts for various conforming and non conforming discretizations such as finite element methods , mixed and mixed hybrid finite element methods , and some finite volume schemes like symmetric mpfa , the vag schemes @xcite , and the hfv schemes @xcite .",
    "our extension of the gradient scheme framework to the hybrid dimensional darcy flow model will account for general fracture networks including fully , partially and non immersed fractures as well as fracture intersections in a 3d surrounding matrix domain .",
    "each individual fracture will be assumed to be planar .",
    "the framework will cover the range of parameters @xmath4 $ ] excluding the value @xmath5 in order to allow for a primal variational formulation .",
    "two examples of gradient discretizations will be provided , namely the extension of the vag and hfv schemes defined in @xcite and @xcite to the family of hybrid dimensional darcy flow models . in both cases , it is assumed that the fracture network is conforming to the mesh in the sense that it is defined as a collection of faces of the mesh .",
    "the mesh is assumed to be polyhedral with possibly non planar faces for the vag scheme and planar faces for the hfv scheme .",
    "two versions of the vag scheme will be studied , the first corresponding to the conforming @xmath6 finite element on a tetrahedral submesh , and the second to a finite volume scheme using lumping for the source terms as well as for the matrix fracture fluxes .",
    "the vag scheme has the advantage to lead to a sparse discretization on tetrahedral or mainly tetrahedral meshes .",
    "it will be compared to the hfv discretization using face and fracture edge unknowns in addition to the cell unknowns .",
    "note that the hfv scheme of @xcite has been generalized in @xcite as the family of hybrid mimetic mixed methods which which encompasses the family of mfd schemes @xcite .",
    "in this article , we will focus without restriction on the particular case presented in @xcite for the sake of simplicity .",

    "<S> we investigate the discretization of darcy flow through fractured porous media on general meshes . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a hybrid dimensional model , invoking a complex network of planar fractures . </S>",
    "<S> the model accounts for matrix - fracture interactions and fractures acting either as drains or as barriers , i.e. we have to deal with pressure discontinuities at matrix - fracture interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical analysis is performed in the general framework of gradient discretizations which is extended to the model under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> two families of schemes namely the vertex approximate gradient scheme ( vag ) and the hybrid finite volume scheme ( hfv ) are detailed and shown to satisfy the gradient scheme framework , which yields , in particular , convergence . </S>",
    "<S> numerical tests confirm the theoretical results . </S>",
