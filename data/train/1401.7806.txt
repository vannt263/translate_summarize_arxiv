    "it is supposed to be a theory of dynamical fuzzy spaces @xcite , and its dynamical variables are a canonical conjugate pair of tensors with three indices of a certain cardinality values , say @xmath1.]@xmath2 .",
    "the model is formulated as a totally constrained system with a number of first - class constraints including hamiltonian ones .",
    "remarkably , the hamiltonian constraints can be uniquely fixed by the algebraic consistency of the constraints and some other physically reasonable assumptions .",
    "indeed , the theoretical structure of the model is very similar to the adm formalism of general relativity @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", our knowledge of the dynamics of the model is quite limited ; locality is favored as a result of quantum dynamics at least for @xmath0 @xcite , and the mini - superspace approximation of general relativity in any dimensions can be derived from the model with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus the present stage of its study is really far from deciding if the classical space - time can be derived as an infrared emergent phenomenon , because of the lack of efficient methods to treat the model .",
    "a possible strategy to study the dynamics of a model would be to relate it to a simpler system . in this paper , a certain statistical system on random networks is considered as such a simpler system .",
    "the random character of networks can be incorporated by defining the partition function of a system in terms of a certain integral form .",

    "there exist also some closely related works @xcite from mathematical viewpoints .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : isingspin ] , we first present a grand type of partition function which has a formal expansion in a dummy variable so that each order of the expansion gives the partition function of a statistical system on random networks of the corresponding number of trivalent vertices .",
    "the symmetries of the system are discussed . in section [ sec : perturbation ] , as the simplest non - trivial case of the statistical model , we study the phase structure of the ising model on random networks by numerically evaluating the polynomial function expressing the partition function . we see that the phase diagram agrees with the prediction made by regarding the hamiltonian vector field of the canonical tensor model with @xmath0 as the renormalization group flow of the ising model . in section [ sec : meanfield ] , we apply the laplace method to obtain an explicit exact expression of the free energy of the ising model on random networks in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the result agrees with the study in section [ sec : perturbation ] . in section [ sec : nonperturbative ] , we discuss the non - perturbative definition of the grand partition function , and , in section [ sec : numnon ] , study its singular property in the non - perturbative regime .",

    "the statistical model considered in this paper is generated from the following grand type of partition function , @xmath4 where the indices take integer values from 1 to @xmath2 , and we take the convention that repeated indices are supposed to be summed over , unless otherwise stated . here",
    "@xmath5 is a real symmetric tensor with three indices , and @xmath6 is a dummy variable introduced for convenience . to define the grand partition function properly",
    ", a special care of the integration contours of @xmath7 is needed due to the unboundedness of the triple coupling term .",
    "this will be discussed in section [ sec : nonperturbative ] .    here",
    "let us first treat the grand partition function @xmath8 in perturbation of @xmath6 .",
    "a formal expansion is given by @xmath9 in this perturbative treatment , the integration contours are set over the real axes , . ] and the integrations are well defined for each @xmath10 . by employing the wick theorem for the gaussian integrations , @xmath10 can be described graphically by the summation of the feynman diagrams which are closed networks randomly connecting @xmath11 trivalent vertices . note that @xmath12 for trivalent vertices .",
    "note also that such networks contain disconnected ones in general , but actually such contributions are negligible in the thermodynamic limit @xmath13 , which will be discussed later .",
    "this can be checked explicitly by computing the @xmath3 case , which has only the graphical degrees of freedom , and comparing the perturbative expansions in @xmath6 of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the coefficients of the latter expansion count only the connected diagrams as textbook knowledge .",
    "thus the networks representing @xmath10 can effectively be regarded as connected ones with probability 1 in the large @xmath11 limit .",
    "in addition to the graphical aspect above , each vertex of a feynman diagram is weighted by @xmath5 , and the summation over the indices can be regarded as that over the degrees of freedom on edges . thus @xmath10 can be regarded as the partition function of a statistical system on random networks which have @xmath11 trivalent vertices and one degree of freedom , which can take @xmath2 different values , on each edge .    in this paper",

    "alternatively , one can put ising spins on vertices . in this case , the relation to the thermodynamic variables is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a two - by - two real matrix satisfying @xmath25 for the ferromagnetic case @xmath26 , it is possible to find such a real @xmath24 .    the partition function @xmath10 defined in is invariant under the orthogonal group transformation , @xmath27 , as @xmath28 where @xmath29 this invariance can be proved by using the invariance of the integration measure in under the orthogonal group transformation of @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",

    "in fact , there exists a simple choice of the integration contours satisfying this invariance , as will be discussed in section [ sec : nonperturbative ] , and we have @xmath32    the grand partition function also has a rescaling invariance given by @xmath33 with real @xmath34 . by ignoring the transformation of the dummy variable @xmath6 , these orthogonal and scale transformations of @xmath16 can be considered to define the gauge transformations of the statistical model .",

    "in fact , there exists a proper way to take the integration contours in complex planes to reconcile the two requirements .    for illustration ,",
    "let us first discuss the simplest case with @xmath3 .",
    "the grand partition function is given by @xmath101 let us assume @xmath102 .",

    "this is equivalent to deforming the integration contour continuously so that @xmath111 for @xmath104 is forced to hold throughout the continuous change of @xmath112 in complex values . with this procedure",
    ", one can easily show that the grand partition function can be equivalently defined by considering first pure imaginary @xmath113 with the integration of @xmath30 over the real axis from @xmath99 to @xmath100 and then performing the analytical continuation of @xmath114 to real values .",

    "this is true for any @xmath2 , and the contours can be taken to be @xmath118 with real @xmath119 .",
    "this simplest common choice of the contours guarantees the gauge invariance of the grand partition function .",
    "more complicated choices of contours depending on @xmath7 or on the signature of @xmath119 will make the invariance a complicated issue to be proved , since the orthogonal transformation mixes the @xmath7s and also the positive and negative values of the @xmath119s .    since the integration contours of @xmath7 are deformed from the real axes into the complex planes , the grand partition function takes complex values in general even for real @xmath112 .",
    "since the perturbative part is the same as the one obtained by the gaussian integrations over the real axes , imaginary values appear only in the non - perturbative corrections to the grand partition function .",

    "in this paper , we have shown the close relationship between the canonical tensor model and a statistical system on random networks of trivalent vertices .",
    "this is explicitly studied for the case of @xmath0 , which corresponds to the ising model on random networks .",
    "we have seen that the phase structure of the ising model agrees with the prediction from the canonical tensor model with @xmath0 , made by regarding the hamilton vector field of the canonical tensor model as the renormalization group flow of the ising model . along the way , we have discussed a general procedure to obtain the exact free energy of the statistical system in the thermodynamic limit , and have actually obtained an explicit exact expression for the ising model on random networks .",
    "we have also provided a non - perturbative definition of the grand partition function which sums up the partition functions of the statistical system on random networks of any number of vertices .",
    "we have numerically investigated it for @xmath0 , and have seen that , in a non - perturbative extreme limit , it seems to develop singularities , the locations of which agree with the prediction from the canonical tensor model .    an important by - product of this paper is that a mean - field - like method has been shown to give the exact free energy of the statistical system on random networks in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is a rather straightforward consequence from the concise expression of the partition function in terms of integrals .",
    "one would in principle be able to analyze the phase structure rather easily by the mean - field - like method for more complicated cases with @xmath163 . new aspects would be expected to appear .",
    "the grand partition function defined in with the integration contour as well as @xmath164 in would be useful as the basic tools for mathematical investigations of the statistical system on random networks .",
    "they are mathematically rigorously defined , and their rather simple expressions would be convenient for obtaining mathematically rigorous arguments to determine rigorously the thermodynamic properties of the statistical system on random networks .",
    "in particular , the numerical study of the singular properties of the grand partition function in section [ sec : numnon ] must be improved by rigorous analytical arguments .",
    "it would also be straightforward to generalize the ( grand ) partition function to the cases of networks of vertices with higher degrees , which are commonly discussed in the literature .",
    "an interesting suggestion of this paper is that there might exist a renormalization group - like procedure for the statistical system on random networks .",
    "this sounds rather curious , since the locality of a system is usually a necessary ingredient in the coarse - graining process , but random networks do not have this property . on the other hand",
    ", the consistency between the hamiltonian vector field of the canonical tensor model and the phase structure seems to suggest the existence of such a process",
    ". it would be highly interesting to find the correct meaning of the flow .",
    "the initial motivation of the present work is to use the statistical model to understand the quantum dynamics of the canonical tensor model .",
    "an important goal is to solve the wheeler - dewitt equation of the canonical tensor model .",
    "though this can be done in a direct manner for the simplest non - trivial case of @xmath0 @xcite , an efficient method is necessary for larger @xmath2 .",
    "since the grand partition function has the same symmetries as the kinematical ones of the canonical tensor model , as well as properties reflecting the hamiltonian vector field , this could be used as a kind of basis of solving the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "another more physically interesting possibility is that the phase structure of the statistical model may be useful in understanding the qualitative behavior of the dynamics of the canonical tensor model .",
    "it is considered that the universe has experienced some phase transitions after its birth , and even the birth itself might have been a phase transition",
    ". it would be especially interesting if we can map the phase transitions of the statistical system to the quantum dynamics of the canonical tensor model , or even the universe itself .",
