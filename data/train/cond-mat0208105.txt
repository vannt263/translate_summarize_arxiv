    "in order to investigate the mechanism of superconductivity ( sc ) in cuprate high-@xmath2 superconductors@xcite , we examine the ground state of the two - dimensional three - band hubbard model for cuo@xmath3 planes which are contained usually in their crystal structures .",
    "it is believed that the cuo@xmath3 plane contains the essential features of high-@xmath2 cuprates.@xcite it is not an easy task to clarify the ground state properties of the 2d three - band hubbard model because of strong correlations among @xmath0 and @xmath4 electrons .",
    "we must treat the strong correlations properly to understand the phase diagram of the high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "the quantum variational monte carlo method ( vmc ) is a tool to investigate the overall structure of phase diagram from weak to strong correlation regions . in this paper",
    "we investigate possible ground states in the three - band hubbard model for cuo@xmath3 plane by employing vmc .",
    "superconductivity in the one - band hubbard model has been studied by numerical@xcite and analytical@xcite calculations .",
    "the three - band hubbard model has also been investigated with intensive efforts recently@xcite .",
    "the exact diagonalization computations for the three - band model in early stage of high-@xmath2 research supported a possibility of superconductivity by showing that holes can bind in small systems@xcite .",
    "it is also reported that the attractive interaction works for both the @xmath0-wave and extended-@xmath5 wave channels based on finite temperature quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations@xcite .",
    "it has been shown recently that one can predict finite @xmath2 for the three - band hubbard model based on perturbative calculations such as generalized rpa treatments@xcite . in perturbative treatments of the one - band and three - band hubbard models , the spin fluctuations induced by the on - site coulomb interaction",
    "promote anisotropic pairing correlations .",
    "qmc evaluations with some constraints due to the fermion sign problem are against a possibility of superconductivity in the three - band hubbard model@xcite .    in order to investigate the possibility and origin of superconductivity ,",
    "the recent work by kondo is important where it has been shown that the @xmath0-wave state has lower energy than the normal state for small @xmath6 by employing the perturbation theory in @xmath6 for the one - band hubbard model.@xcite this indicates that the ground state is superconductive with @xmath0-wave symmetry for small values of @xmath6 .",
    "we can expect that this also holds for the three - band model@xcite .",
    "it is then natural to expect that the @xmath0-wave state is stable for finite @xmath6 unless there occurs some ordering in the ground state . among several possible long - range orderings , antiferromagnetic",
    "one should be examined because the state with antiferromagnetic ordering is considerably stable near half - filling .",
    "in fact , according to vmc work for the one - band hubbard model , the antiferromagnetic ( af ) energy gain is larger than the sc energy gain by almost two order of magnitude near half - filling",
    ". then the competition between sc and af states is very severe for the sc state@xcite .",
    "the sc region for the one - band hubbard model is considerably restricted and a possibility of pure superconducting state is very small@xcite .",
    "a similar feature has been obtained by vmc evaluations for @xmath7 three - band hubbard model@xcite where antiferromagnetic region extends up to 50 percent doping and the @xmath0-wave phase exists only in the infinitesimally small region near the boundary of antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "thus vmc results performed recently are consistent with the constrained path qmc calculations@xcite in the sense that a possibility of @xmath0-wave phase for the one - band hubbard model and @xmath7 three - band hubbard model is small at present , although an attractive interaction works for @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "we expect that the antiferromagnetic region will shrink for the three - band hubbard model if we adjust parameters contained in the model .",
    "the parameters of the three - band hubbard model are given by the coulomb repulsion @xmath8 , energy levels of @xmath4 electrons @xmath9 and @xmath0 electron @xmath10 , and transfer between @xmath4 orbitals given by @xmath1 .",
    "a purpose of this paper is to investigate the property of antiferromagnetic state and a competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity for finite @xmath8 based on the three - band model following ansatz of gutzwiller - projected wave functions .",
    "it has also been argued that holes doped in the antiferromagnetically correlated spin systems induce incommensurate spin correlations in the ground state for the one - band hubbard model@xcite and three - band model@xcite within the mean field approximation . in the mean - field treatment",
    "the energy scales appear to be extremely large compared to values for real materials .",
    "recent neutron - scattering experiments revealed incommensurate spin structures@xcite developed at low temperatures and at low energies .",
    "the static incommensurate structure was reported on lsco samples : la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 , la@xmath14nd@xmath15cuo@xmath13 and la@xmath11sr@xmath12nio@xmath16 .",
    "the incommensurate magnetic peaks have been also reported for yba@xmath3cu@xmath17o@xmath18 by the inelastic neutron - scattering experiments .",
    "this type of inhomogeneous state may possibly provide a key concept to resolve the anomalous properties of high-@xmath2 cuprates in the underdoped region .",
    "we will examine a possible phase of incommensurate states for the three - band hubbard model by variational monte carlo method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the wave functions are presented .",
    "the sc state and uniform sdw state are discussed in section iii and a stability of incommensurate state is examined in the subsequent section .",

    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the operators for the @xmath4 electrons at site @xmath27 . similarly @xmath28 and @xmath29 are defined .",
    "other notations are standard and energies are measured in units of @xmath30 . for simplicity",
    "we neglect the coulomb interaction among @xmath4 electrons .",
    "we consider the normal state , bcs and sdw wave functions with the gutzwiller projection .",
    "these types of functions are standard wave functions and well describe the ground - state properties with several long - range orderings .",
    "they have been investigated intensively for the one - band hubbard model@xcite . in refs.@xcite",
    "it has been discussed that they can be improved systematically by operating correlation factors @xmath31 . for the model shown above",
    "they are written as @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the linear combination of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 constructed to express an operator for the lowest band of a non - interacting hamiltonian in the hole picture . for @xmath39 , @xmath35",

    "is given by a linear combination of two wave numbers @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the commensurate vector @xmath68 .",
    "we can also investigate the incommensurate sdw state with incommensurate vector @xmath69 by diagonalizing the hartree - fock hamiltonian with antiferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "the system sizes are given by @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the projected bcs wave function and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the incommensurate sdw states .",
    "our calculations are performed with the periodic and the antiperiodic boundary conditions for the @xmath23- and @xmath24-direction , respectively .",
    "this set of boundary conditions was chosen so that @xmath59 does not vanish for any @xmath66-points possibly occupied by electrons .",
    "the expectation values are calculated following the standard monte carlo procedure by using the metropolis algorithm . in the process of finding a minimum of energy",
    ", we should optimize many parameters included in the wave functions .",
    "for such purpose we employ correlated measurements method to reduce the required cpu time@xcite .",
    "first , let us discuss the sdw phase near half - filling by evaluating the ground - state energy for optimized parameters @xmath77 , @xmath40 and af order parameter @xmath78 .",
    "we set @xmath79 throughout this paper .",
    "it is expected that holes introduced by doping are responsible for the disappearance of long - range antiferromagnetic ordering@xcite .",
    "we show the sdw energy gain @xmath80 in fig.1 as a function of doping ratio for several values of @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath80 increases and the sdw region becomes large as @xmath81 increases .",
    "the figure 2 shows the sdw energy gain for several values of @xmath1 , where @xmath80 is reduced as @xmath1 increases . in figs.3(a ) and 3(b ) the dependence on coulomb repulsion @xmath8 is shown ; the sdw phase extends up to 30 percent doping when @xmath8 is large .",
    "then it follows that the sdw region will be reduced if @xmath81 and @xmath8 decrease or @xmath1 increases .",
    "in fact , fig.4 shows the boundary of sdw phase in the @xmath1-@xmath82 plane for @xmath83 where @xmath82 is the hole density and negative density indicates electron doping .",
    "compared to the calculations for @xmath7 the sdw region is reduced greatly@xcite .",
    "next , let us turn to the projected - bcs wave function , where the gutzwiller parameter @xmath77 , effective level difference @xmath40 , chemical potential @xmath84 and superconducting order parameter @xmath85 are considered as variational parameters . in fig.5",
    "we show the energy as a function of @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath83 and @xmath87 and doping ratio is given by @xmath88 for ( a ) and @xmath89 for ( b ) .",
    "the @xmath0-wave superconductivity is most stable among various possible states such as isotropic @xmath5-wave and anisotropic @xmath5-wave pairing states .",
    "the squares in fig.5 denote the values for the normal state , which are estimated independently by using an alternative monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the finite sc energy gain indicates that the attractive interaction works for @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "the sc energy gain ( which is called the sc condensation energy in this paper ) is also dependent on @xmath81 , as is shown in fig.6 for @xmath90 , @xmath83 and @xmath88 on @xmath70 lattice .",
    "this shows a tendency that the sc condensation energy increases as @xmath81 increases , which is consistent with calculations for @xmath7.@xcite it is noted that the dependence on @xmath81 for the sc energy gain is rather weak compared to the sdw energy gain .",
    "we also note that the sc energy gains for @xmath83 are mostly of the same order of those for @xmath7.@xcite    from the calculations for the sdw wave functions , we should set @xmath81 and @xmath8 small so that the sdw phase does not occupy a huge region near half - filling . in fig.7",
    "we show energy gains for both the sdw and sc states for @xmath83 , @xmath90 and @xmath87 , where the negative delta indicates the electron - doping case .",
    "solid symbols indicate the results for @xmath71 and open symbols for @xmath70 . for this set of parameters",
    "the sdw region extends up to 20 percent doping and the pure @xmath0-wave phase exists outside of the sdw phase .",
    "the @xmath0-wave phase may be possibly identified with superconducting phase in the overdoped region in the high-@xmath2 superconductors .    the superconducting condensation energy obtained by our calculations",
    "is estimated as @xmath91mev per site in the overdoped region near the boundary of sdw phase from the difference between the minimum and the intercept of the @xmath92 curve with the vertical axis , where we set @xmath93ev as estimated from cluster calculations@xcite .",
    "we have also estimated @xmath94 from several experiments such as specific heat or critical field measurements for optimally doped samples .",
    "they are given as @xmath95mev from specific heat data@xcite and @xmath96mev from critical magnetic field value @xmath97@xcite .",
    "our value is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data as was already shown for the hubbard model where the sc energy gain in the bulk limit is given by 0.00117t / site=0.59mev / site@xcite .",
    "this agreement between the theoretical and experimental condensation energy is highly remarkable .",
    "we expect that this value is not far from the correct value according to the evaluations for improved wave functions@xcite , where it was shown that the energy gain is not changed so much due to multiplicative correlation factors @xmath98",
    ". we can not estimate the sc condensation energy in the underdoped region because the sdw state is more stable than @xmath0-wave state and the sc condensation energy is not available experimentally due to a loss of entropy in the underdoped region@xcite .",
    "the phase structure obtained by our calculations agrees well with the available phase diagram indicated by experiments qualitatively , which means that a large sdw phase exists in the underdoped region and there is a @xmath0-wave superconducting phase next to sdw phase in the overdoped region .",
    "our calculations for electron - doping case predict @xmath0-wave symmetry away from half - filling , which is consistent with recent experiments on nd@xmath99ce@xmath100cuo@xmath101@xcite .",
    "in this section let us discuss the underdoped region where the sdw state is significantly stable as shown in the previous section .",
    "let us note that the sdw state can be possibly stabilized further if we take into account a spin modulation in space , as has also been studied for the one - band hubbard model@xcite and the t - j model@xcite .",
    "we can introduce a stripe in the uniform spin density state so that doped holes occupy new levels close to the starting fermi energy keeping the energy loss of antiferromagnetic background minimum .",
    "the wave function with a stripe can be taken of the gutzwiller type : @xmath102 .",

    "@xmath121 denotes the position of a stripe . in actual calculations we set @xmath122 and @xmath123 since the energy expectation values are mostly independent of @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "since any eigenfunction of the hamiltonian @xmath105 can be a variational wave function , we optimize @xmath117 instead of fixing it in order to lower the energy expectation value further .",
    "it is also possible to assume that @xmath113 and @xmath114 oscillate according to cosine curve given as cos(@xmath124 ) and cos(@xmath125 ) , respectively .",
    "both methods give almost the same results within monte carlo statistical errors .",
    "recent neutron scattering experiments suggested that modulation vectors are given by @xmath126 and @xmath127 in the underdoped region , where @xmath82 denotes the doping ratio .",
    "here we define @xmath128-lattice stripe as an incommensurate state with one stripe per n ladders for which @xmath109 is given by @xmath129 .",
    "then the incommensurate state predicted by neutron experiments for @xmath130 is given by 4-lattice stripe .",
    "for the three - band model , the transfer @xmath1 between oxygen orbitals plays an important role to determine a possible sdw state .",
    "if @xmath1 is very large , the uniform sdw state is expected to be stabilized because holes doped on oxygen sites can move around on the lattice producing disorder effect on spin ordering uniformly . for small @xmath1 the stripe states",
    "are considered to be realized@xcite .",
    "our motivation to consider non - uniform states for the three - band model lies in the idea that the distance between stripes may be dependent upon @xmath1 , i.e. for small @xmath1 the distance between stripes is large , for intermediate values of @xmath1 the 4-lattice stripe state is realized and for large @xmath1 the uniform state or normal state is stable .    in fig.8",
    "we show the energies for commensurate and incommensurate sdw states on @xmath72 lattice at @xmath130 as a function of @xmath1 , where we impose the antiperiodic and periodic boundary conditions in @xmath23- and @xmath24-direction , respectively , so that the closed shell structure is followed for doped holes .",
    "we assumed that @xmath131 , 2 and 2.4 .",
    "the 8-lattice stripe state for small @xmath1 changes into uniform state as @xmath1 increases .",
    "it shows that incommensurate states become stable for large level difference @xmath81 . the spin and charge densities of incommensurate state",
    "are shown in fig.9 for @xmath132 and @xmath87 where the charge density is a sum of hole numbers on @xmath0- , @xmath50- and @xmath51-orbitals at site @xmath133 .",
    "spin density @xmath134 vanishes at the positions of stripes associated with peaks of hole density .",
    "the spin structure factor @xmath135 really has incommensurate peaks as is shown in fig.10 .",
    "the figures 11(a ) and 11(b ) present the energies of incommensurate states for @xmath76 lattice ( which contains 768 atoms ) where we set antiperiodic and periodic boundary conditions in @xmath23- and @xmath24-direction , respectively , for ( a ) and in @xmath24- and @xmath23- direction , respectively , for ( b ) .",
    "both figures give almost the same results as an evidence that the effect of boundary conditions is small for @xmath76 system .",
    "as expected , the structure of incommensurate state is dependent upon the values of @xmath1 .",
    "let us turn to a discussion of the energy gain due to a formation of stripes , which is estimated from an extrapolation to the bulk limit as shown in fig.12 .",
    "one notes that the energy gain increases as the system size increases .",
    "the energy gain per site for 4-lattice stripe state is given by @xmath136mev .",
    "furthermore the energy difference between commensurate and incommensurate states is found to be finite in the bulk limit , which is shown in fig.13 .",
    "thus within vmc the stripe state with spin modulation is stable at @xmath130 doping .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order parameter @xmath118 in eq.(18 ) is of the order of @xmath137ev , while the sc order parameter @xmath85 ( which gives the minimum of energy ) is of the order of @xmath138mev@xmath139mev at @xmath140 .",
    "the magnitude of sc order parameter agrees with measurements of tunneling spectroscopy@xcite where @xmath85 is estimated as @xmath141mev for ybco sample.@xcite the antiferromagnetic order parameter is larger than sc order parameter at least by one order of magnitude .",
    "the charge order parameter @xmath117 in eq.(17 ) is small and negligible compared to @xmath114 .",
    "we have presented our evaluations for the 2d three - band hubbard model based on the variational monte carlo method . our work is regarded as a starting step for more sophisticated calculations in future such as the inclusion of correlation factors of jastrow type or green function monte carlo approaches .",
    "the sc energy scales obtained from our evaluations are consistent with experimental indications , which provides a support to our approaches .    according to vmc the attractive interaction works for @xmath0-wave pairing due to electron correlations .",
    "the strength of @xmath8 is also important to determine the phase boundary of the sdw phase .",
    "if @xmath8 is extremely large , the sdw region extends up to large doping for which the @xmath0-wave region is restricted to infinitesimally small region near the boundary of antiferromagnetic phase . for intermediate values of @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath81 the sdw region is reduced and the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase may exist . the fact that the sc condensation energy agrees reasonably with the experimental data for optimally doped samples supports our computations .",
    "the magnitude of sc order parameter is also consistent with tunneling spectroscopy experiments . from our data for @xmath142 and @xmath85 and the relation @xmath143 , the effective density of state @xmath144 can be estimated as @xmath145 at @xmath140 in the overdoped region , which is not far from the bcs estimate @xmath146 to 3(ev)@xmath147 by using @xmath148 for optimally doped ybco.@xcite",
    "we expect that the pure @xmath0-wave state from optimal to overdoped regions may be described by the projected - bcs wave function .",
    "the phase diagram for electron - doping is consistent with the available experimental indications suggesting that the properties of electron - doped materials may be understood within our approach . in the sdw region",
    "the incommensurate spin structures are stabilized for the low - doping case to keep the energy loss minimum due to disorder effect caused by holes .",
    "a competition among the uniform sdw state , sdw state with stripes , and pure @xmath0-wave sc is highly non - trivial .",
    "a picture for the hole - doping case followed from our evaluations is that a stripe state is stable in the underdoped region and changes into the @xmath0-wave sc in the overdoped region .",
    "we thank s. koikegami for valuable discussions .",
