    "a _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ wfpc2 h@xmath1  image of the   region deml106",
    "@xcite in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) revealed a pair of bright , compact  regions embedded within a large shell nebula @xcite .",
    "deml106  has been previously cataloged by @xcite as n30 , and the two compact  regions were identified as an  knot and designated as n30b . as shown in figure  1 , while the main body of n30b is unremarkable , it is surrounded by a halo with sharp edges on the northern rim facing the luminous b[e ] supergiant hen s22",
    "(= hd34664 ; * ? ? ?",
    "b[e ] supergiants are known to possess stellar winds @xcite .",
    "the nebular morphology and relative location of hen s22 and n30b thus appear to suggest that the halo of n30b is a bow shock produced by dynamical interactions with the wind of hen s22 .",
    "a two - component stellar wind model has been proposed for b[e ] supergiants : ( 1 ) a cool , slow wind along a dusty equatorial disk which gives rise to narrow , low - excitation emission lines of , e.g. , , [ ] , and [ ] , and ( 2 ) a hot , fast polar wind that is responsible for the broad , high - excitation absorption lines of , e.g. , , , and @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 spectra of hen s22 in the 18003200   range are dominated by p cygni type lines of , from which it is derived that the equatorial disk is viewed nearly edge - on and the terminal wind velocity along the disk is @xmath6 km  s@xmath3@xcite ; while @xmath5 spectra in the 11501950   range show blue - shifted absorption of and indicating that the polar wind of hen s22 has an expansion velocity @xmath71000 km  s@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "n30b is projected at 20@xmath830@xmath8 ( or 57.5 pc for a distance of 50 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from hen s22 ; its 24@xmath8 spatial extent ( figure 1 ) has a good chance to be partially located above the disk and interact with the polar wind of hen s22 .    to determine the nature and physical properties of the bow - shock - like halo around n30b , we have obtained high - dispersion , long - slit echelle spectra of n30b , its bow - shock - like halo , its surrounding interstellar medium , and hen s22 .",
    "we find that the bow - shock - like halo shows surprisingly broad h@xmath1  line profiles similar to that of hen s22 , suggesting that it is a reflection nebula .",
    "furthermore , the spectral features vary from the east side to the west side of n30b , indicating that _ n30b indeed sees the wind of hen s22 along a range of viewing angles_. recently archived @xmath0 wfpc2 images of n30b obtained by the hubble heritage project provide additional support to the interpretation of a reflection nebula for the halo of n30b . in this paper , we report these observations , and discuss the physical properties of n30b , the nature of its halo , and the implication of our results on the disk and polar winds of the b[e ] supergiant hen s22 .",
    "our @xmath0 wfpc2 images of deml106 ( pi : chu ) were obtained on 1998 november 14 .",
    "the observations were made through the _ f656n _ ( h@xmath1 ) filter for @xmath9 s. the images were processed using the standard @xmath0 data pipeline and then combined to remove cosmic rays and to produce an image with a total exposure time of 2400 s. we further processed the resultant image with the standard procedures outlined in @xcite to extract h@xmath1  fluxes .",
    "two corrections have been applied to these h@xmath1  fluxes due to the @xmath10300 km  s@xmath3 red - shift of the lmc .",
    "first , the filter transmission of the red - shifted h@xmath1  line is @xmath11% of the peak transmission , so the extracted h@xmath1fluxes are multiplied by a correction factor of 1.07 .",
    "second , the [ ]  @xmath126548 line is red - shifted into the h@xmath1  passband at @xmath13% of the peak transmission . using the [ ]",
    "@xmath126548/h@xmath1  ratio measured from our echelle spectra ( see  2.2 ) , we find that the [ ]  @xmath126548 line contributes to @xmath14% of the h@xmath1  flux . therefore , an additional correction factor of 0.96 is applied to the extracted h@xmath1  fluxes .",
    "the @xmath0 wfpc2 images of deml106 for the hubble heritage project ( pi : noll ) were obtained on 2001 october 18 .",
    "the observations were made with the @xmath15 ( wfpc2 @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 ( wfpc2 @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 ( wfpc2 @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 ( [ ] ) , and @xmath22 ( [ ] ) filters for exposure times of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 s , respectively .",
    "note that the broad - band images may contain contributions from nebular lines , e.g. , the @xmath16 band contains the h@xmath28 , h@xmath29 , and h@xmath30 lines and the @xmath18 band contains the h@xmath31 line .",
    "we have processed these images using standard procedures .",
    "we have also adjusted the coordinates using astrometric solutions calculated from the gsc2.2 positions of 9 stars on the wf2 chip ; our final coordinates should have @xmath10 02 accuracy .",
    "the wfpc2 images of n30b are presented in figure 2 .",
    "high - dispersion spectra of deml106 were obtained with the echelle spectrograph on the 4 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) from two observing runs , 2000 january 22 and december 7 .",
    "both runs used the 79 line mm@xmath3 echelle grating in the single - order , long - slit observing configuration , in which a flat mirror replaced a cross disperser and a post - slit h@xmath1  filter was inserted to isolate a single order .",
    "the red long focus camera and the 2000@xmath322000 site2k_6 ccd were used to record data .",
    "the 24 @xmath33 m pixel size corresponds to roughly 0.082   along the dispersion and 026 perpendicular to the dispersion .",
    "limited by the optics of the camera , the useful spatial coverage is @xmath103@xmath34 .",
    "the spectral coverage is wide enough to include both the h@xmath1  line and the flanking [ ]  @xmath12@xmath126548 , 6583 lines .",
    "a slitwidth of 250 @xmath33 m ( 164 ) was used and the resultant fwhm of the instrumental profile was @xmath35 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the spectral dispersion was calibrated by a th - ar lamp exposure taken in the beginning of the night , but the absolute wavelength was calibrated against the geocoronal h@xmath1  line present in the nebular observations . the journal of echelle observations is given in table  1 .",
    "the two small  regions in n30b are aligned roughly along the east - west direction , thus we call these two regions n30b - e and n30b - w , respectively . in the h@xmath1  image ,",
    "apart from the bow - shock - like halo , the bright central regions of these two  regions have simple morphologies expected for strmgren spheres .",
    "n30b - e is about 7@xmath8 ( 1.7 pc ) in diameter and shows a bright spot at its northern edge , while n30b - w is 6@xmath8 ( 1.45 pc ) across and has a rather uniform surface brightness .",
    "the @xmath0 wfpc2 h@xmath1  image , with stellar emission excised , can be used to estimate the h@xmath1  luminosities and required ionizing fluxes of the  regions in n30b .",
    "we have made two measurements which differ in their assumption as to whether the halo is a reflection nebula or part of the  regions . if the halo around the  regions is an envelope reflecting the light from hen s22 , a background component similar to the halo",
    "should be subtracted .",
    "the resultant integrated h@xmath1  fluxes for the 7@xmath8 and 6@xmath8 strmgren spheres of n30b - e and n30b - w are @xmath36 ergs  @xmath37  s@xmath3 and @xmath38 ergs  @xmath37  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these fluxes have been corrected for the filter transmission and [ ]  contamination .",
    "if the halo is ionized , a low background exterior to n30b should be used and the integrated fluxes of the  regions including the halo would be about 80% larger ; however , as we show in  3.3 this is not the case , so these large fluxes will not be used in further discussions . adopting the extinction of d106 - 10 in n30b - w , @xmath39 = 0.14 @xcite , and a distance of 50 kpc",
    ", we derive h@xmath1  luminosities of @xmath40 ergs  s@xmath3 and @xmath41 ergs  s@xmath3 and required ionizing fluxes of @xmath42 photons  s@xmath3 and @xmath43 photons  s@xmath3 for the strmgren spheres of n30b - e and n30b - w , respectively . using the average surface brightness and adopting an emitting path length similar to the diameter of the  region",
    ", we have further derived the rms densities of n30b - e and n30b - w , both @xmath1075 h - atoms @xmath44 .    to examine the stellar content and to estimate the available ionizing fluxes in n30b ,",
    "we have carried out photometry for stars brighter than @xmath18 = 20 , using the wfpc2 @xmath16 and @xmath18 images .",
    "such bright stars are expected to be of early types , so it is possible to apply constant zeropoints to transform the wfpc2 @xmath16 and @xmath18 to johnson @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram of johnson @xmath18 versus @xmath45 is presented in figure 3 . using the colors and magnitudes and assuming that these stars are still on the main sequence",
    ", we can deredden the stars and estimate their spectral types .",
    "this is easily done by projecting the position of a star in the color - magnitude diagram along the dereddening direction back to the main sequence .",
    "the photometric measurements and estimated spectral types are given in table 2 .",
    "most of these stars have also been studied by @xcite using ground - based observations .",
    "the differences between her results and the new wfpc2 results are also given in table 2 for comparison .",
    "excellent agreements in photometry are found for stars in isolation , but the ground - based measurements for faint stars in crowded regions may have errors as large as @xmath46 1 mag .    in n30b and its vicinity ,",
    "stars brighter than @xmath18 = 20 are all b stars . ionizing fluxes from early - type stars have been given by @xcite down to b3 and @xcite down to b0.5 .",
    "the ionizing fluxes of b0v and b0.5v stars given by the latter are significantly higher than those of the former .",
    "n30b - e contains only one early b star , star # 13 in table 2 ; the ionizing flux of this b2.5v star is @xmath47 photons s@xmath3 @xcite , two orders of magnitude lower than that required to ionize n30b - e .",
    "it is possible that the b[e ] supergiant hen s22 , of spectral type b0b0.5 @xcite , plays a significant role in the photoionization of n30b - e .",
    "n30b - w contains the bright star # 6 , which is saturated in the wfpc2 images , but has been previously classified spectroscopically as a b1.5v star (= d106 - 10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ionizing flux of a b1.5v star given by @xcite is 2@xmath3210@xmath48 photons s@xmath3 , which is also about two orders of magnitude lower than the required .",
    "however , extrapolating from the ionizing fluxes of b0v and b0.5v stars given by @xcite , we find that the ionizing flux of the b1.5v star # 6 ( d106 - 10 ) is sufficient to ionize n30b - w .",
    "the relationship between the  regions in n30b and the surrounding giant shell deml106 may be assessed from their kinematic properties .",
    "an example of our echelle observations is illustrated in figures 4a and 4b in two stretches to show the h@xmath1  and [ ]  @xmath126548 lines from the e - w slit centered near the star # 6 in n30b - w .",
    "the vertical axis is spatial with east on top , and the horizontal axis is spectral with wavelength increasing to the right . for convenience",
    ", we have converted wavelengths to heliocentric velocities of the h@xmath1  line and marked them along the horizontal axis in figure 4 .",
    "( all radial velocities in this paper are heliocentric . )",
    "the narrowest lines with uniform surface brightness along the slit are telluric h@xmath1  and oh lines , located near 0 , @xmath2425 , and + 660 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the nebular h@xmath1  and [ ]  @xmath126548 lines can be found at + 300 and @xmath2380 km  s@xmath3 , respectively . the h@xmath1  line in figures 4a and 4b shows a bright , narrow component and a faint , broad component .",
    "the spatial extent of the broad component coincides with that of n30b s halo ; this component will be discussed in  3.3 .",
    "the narrow h@xmath1  component arises from ionized gas .",
    "the two h@xmath1  emission peaks near the center of figure 4a correspond to the  regions n30b - e and n30b - w , while the fainter h@xmath1  emission extending throughout the entire slit length corresponds to the giant shell in deml106 .",
    "no line splitting is detected in h@xmath1  or [ ]  for either n30b or deml106 .    to analyze the kinematics of ionized gas quantitatively , we have extracted velocity profiles of the h@xmath1  and [ ]  lines along each slit , made gaussian fits , and plotted the results in figure 5 .",
    "the fitted velocities are plotted along the slit positions , with h@xmath1  in filled symbols and [ ]  in open symbols ; the fitted fwhm of the h@xmath1  line is plotted as the  error bar \" at each position , except where data points are densely packed .",
    "the observed fwhm of the h@xmath1  line is the quadratic sum of the instrumental fwhm ( 13.5 km  s@xmath3 ) , the thermal fwhm ( 21.4 km  s@xmath3  at a temperature of 10@xmath49 k ) , and the turbulent fwhm .",
    "thus the observed h@xmath1  fwhm of @xmath1026 km  s@xmath3  for the  regions in n30b implies a turbulent fwhm of @xmath106 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this small internal turbulence is consistent with the expectation for  regions ionized by early b - type stars , because they lack strong fast stellar winds .",
    "the giant shell in deml106 has a larger observed fwhm in h@xmath1 , 3540 km  s@xmath3 , implying a turbulent fwhm of 2431 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the lack of line splitting suggest that this large turbulent fwhm is dominated by turbulence instead of a systematic shell expansion .",
    "further kinematic information is provided by the velocity variations shown in figure 5 .",
    "the average heliocentric velocity of deml106 is @xmath10 300 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "gradual velocity excursions of up to @xmath5010 km  s@xmath3  from the average velocity are seen . along",
    "the ns slit centered on hen s22 , a systematic blue - shift of @xmath210 km  s@xmath3  is seen in the [ ]  @xmath126583 line .",
    "( the nebular h@xmath1  line is too contaminated by the stellar emission to be measured near the star . )",
    "these blue - shifts provide the only evidence that the internal motion of deml106 does contain a component of systematic expansion at a level of @xmath1010 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the kinematics of deml106 show that this giant shell , formed by hen s22 and the other massive stars in the ob association lh38 @xcite , is by no means a simple expanding shell with a large central cavity .",
    "the interior of deml106 may still contain a significant amount of gas in the form of dense cloudlets , and the dynamical interactions between the fast stellar winds and the cloudlets contribute to the large turbulent fwhm observed in deml106 .",
    "the systemic velocities of the  regions in n30b are similar to that of deml106 , suggesting that n30b is physically associated with deml106 .",
    "the gas in the vicinity of n30b and especially between its two   regions shows blue - shifts of @xmath25 to @xmath210 km  s@xmath3  from the systemic velocity ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "low - velocity flows can be produced by an evaporation off the ionization fronts in  regions or dynamic interactions between stellar winds and  regions . in an evaporation flow ,",
    "the gas projected outside the  disk would have motions perpendicular to the line of sight and show no offsets from the systemic velocity .",
    "in a dynamic interaction scenario , if the stellar wind source is on the far side of an  region , the ablation of the   region by the stellar wind would produce a gas flow toward us .",
    "the ubiquitous blue - shifts observed in the vicinity of n30b indicate that the dynamic interaction between the stellar wind of hen s22 and the  regions in n30b is responsible for these low - velocity gas flow .",
    "n30b is probably one of the dense clouds within deml106 ; its visibility is attributed to the early - b stars formed in its interior .",
    "we initially speculated that the bow - shock - like halo around n30b was produced by interactions between the fast polar wind of hen s22 and the  regions , and expected to see corresponding supersonic kinematic features within the spatial extent of the halo .",
    "the h@xmath1 + [ ]  echellogram of n30b in figure 4 shows that the only kinematic feature that matches the spatial extent of the halo is a prominent , broad h@xmath1  emission component .",
    "the continuous distribution of this broad component over 18@xmath8 , from the eastern edge of n30b - e s halo to the western edge of n30b - w s halo , indicates that the halo envelopes the  regions of n30b .",
    "the broad h@xmath1  emission is centered near 300 km  s@xmath3  and detected over a velocity range greater than 1000 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "such high velocities obviously can not be accelerated by the wind of hen s22 ; furthermore , such strong shocks would have produced more dramatic dynamic effects , such as x - ray emission , which is not seen @xcite .",
    "large velocity widths ( @xmath7 1000 km  s@xmath3 ) have been observed in other  regions , for example , the carina nebula in our galaxy and the giant  region ngc5471 in m101 .",
    "the broad hydrogen balmer line emission in the car ii region in the carina nebula has been attributed to the dust - scattered balmer emission of @xmath51 carinae and is detected at as far as 5 pc from @xmath51 car @xcite .",
    "the broad h@xmath1  and [ ]  lines in ngc5471 have been suggested to be powered by supernova explosions and fast stellar winds @xcite .",
    "clearly , n30b can not be associated with supernova explosions , since no x - ray emission has been detected from this region @xcite .",
    "furthermore , n30b does not show broad [ ]  lines as are seen in ngc5471 , and therefore it should not have the same physical nature as the broad - line region in ngc5471 .",
    "we will thus focus on whether the broad h@xmath1  line from the halo of n30b may be dust - scattered h@xmath1  emission of the b[e ] supergiant hen s22 .    to compare the broad h@xmath1  emission from the halo of n30b to that of hen s22",
    ", we display the echellogram and h@xmath1  line profiles of hen s22 in figure 4c  d , below the echellogram of n30b .",
    "while they show qualitatively similar profiles with an absorption component blue - shifted from the centroid of the broad h@xmath1  emission , the widths and depths of the absorption are different .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in the reflection nebula car ii near @xmath51 car .",
    "@xcite extracted h@xmath1  line profiles from six positions in car ii ; these broad profiles ( in their figure 3 ) all show an absorption component on the blue side of the nebular line , but the absorption strength decreases radially from @xmath51 car .",
    "@xcite suggested that the spatial variations in the dust - scattered h@xmath1  line in car ii reflected the temporal variability of the h@xmath1  profile of @xmath51 car @xcite .",
    "however , after monitoring the h@xmath1  profiles of @xmath51 car and car ii from 1985 to 1997 , @xcite show that the the absorption feature in the reflected h@xmath1  line is spatially variable across car ii but temporally invariable over the 12-yr span , and conclude that the reflection nebula is located within a 46@xmath52-wide cone of light from @xmath51 car along the axis of its bipolar homunculus nebula .",
    "we suggest that the broad h@xmath1  line from n30b s halo is also dust - scattered h@xmath1  emission from a nearby h@xmath1-emitting star , hen s22 in this case .",
    "the position - dependence of the broad h@xmath1  line in n30b is also caused by different viewing angles , instead of a temporal variability of hen s22 , as discussed further in  3.5 .",
    "the reflection nebula around n30b is not unique in the vicinity of hen s22 .",
    "our echelle observations also detected broad h@xmath1   line profiles in the nebulosity at 20@xmath8 east of n30b , at a much fainter level .",
    "the bow - shock - like morphology of the reflection nebula around n30b is also not unique among reflection nebulae , as a similar nebula has been observed around the b2v star lss3027 in our galaxy @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the bow - shock - like structure curves with the apex toward an ob association , lh38 for n30b @xcite and stock 16 for lss3027 @xcite .",
    "the relative nebular and stellar positions are highly suggestive that the stellar radiation and winds from the ob association are responsible for the bow - shock - like morphology of the reflection nebula . for n30b ,",
    "the dynamical interaction is further supported by the small blue - shift , @xmath25 to @xmath210 km  s@xmath3 , of the ionized gas in the vicinity of the two  regions .",
    "this flow velocity , @xmath25 to @xmath210 km  s@xmath3 , is subsonic for 10@xmath49 k ionized gas but supersonic for cold neutral gas .",
    "since the reflective envelope of n30b contains dust and mostly neutral gas , flow velocities of 510 km  s@xmath3  would be supersonic ; thus the morphology of n30b s halo may indeed be produced by a bow shock .",
    "the nature of n30b s halo as a reflection nebula is supported by the wfpc2 @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 images in figure 2 .",
    "these three broad - band images show similar morphologies among one another , with almost uniform surface brightness across n30b .",
    "hardly any enhancement is seen over the strmgren spheres where bright h@xmath1  emission is present , indicating that the contribution of nebular line emission from the  regions is minimal compared to the scattered stellar continuum and line emission .",
    "therefore , we may use the observed broad - band surface brightness of n30b s reflection nebula and a few simple assumptions to determine the likely position of n30b relative to the b[e ] star hen s22 .",
    "first , we assume a single value for the spherical albedo of every dust grain .",
    "we also assume that the reflection nebula is optically thick , i.e. , every photon from hen s22 incident upon the reflection nebula is either absorbed or scattered .",
    "it has been shown that dust scattering has an angular dependence and follows the phase function @xmath53 where @xmath1 is the deviation of the photon from the forward direction , @xmath28 is the spherical albedo of the dust grains , and @xmath54 is a measurement of the asymmetry of the phase function as given by the expression , @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we have adopted dust grain properties reported by @xcite for wavelengths longward of 3000  , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "as shown in figure 6 , the scattering angle @xmath1 is related to the projected distance @xmath58 from hen s22 to the reflection nebula by @xmath59 . using the phase function and the brightness of hen s22",
    ", we can calculate the surface brightness of the reflection nebula expected for a given geometry of the reflection .",
    "the broad - band photometry of hen s22 from 1957 to 1991 show stable brightnesses and colors : @xmath60 and @xmath45 = + 0.28 @xcite .",
    "the reddening of hen s22 , @xmath39 = 0.250.30 , is higher than those of the other stars in deml106 because of its edge - on disk @xcite .",
    "the broad - band photometry of hen s22 made by @xcite in 1994 shows a similar @xmath61 , but a higher @xmath39 = 0.46 .",
    "we have adopted an @xmath39 of 0.25 to deredden the johnson @xmath16 magnitude of hen s22 , and converted it to the wfpc2 @xmath16 ( @xmath15 ) magnitude .",
    "we then calculate the expected surface brightness of the reflection nebula in the wfpc2 @xmath16 band for a range of scattering angles . to compare these predictions to observations ,",
    "a reddening appropriate for the reflection nebula needs to be applied . as",
    "the reflection nebula is on the surface of n30b , its extinction should be no greater than the minimum extinction found among stars in n30b , @xmath62 .",
    "we have applied this amount of extinction to the expected surface brightness of the reflection nebula , and the results are presented in table  3 .",
    "the maximum expected surface brightness comes at a scattering angle of @xmath1040@xmath63 , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath108  pc between hen s22 and the reflection nebula .",
    "we have measured an average surface brightness of 1.6  @xmath32  10@xmath64  ergs  s@xmath3  @xmath37  arcsec@xmath65 for n30b s reflection nebula in the wfpc @xmath16 band .",
    "this observed surface brightness is 20% higher than the maximum expected surface brightness . considering that our assumptions and calculation are crude , the observed and expected surface brightness of the reflection nebula are in remarkably good agreement .",
    "as discussed in  3.5 , the reflection nebula is above the equatorial disk and sees a less reddened hen s22 , the expected surface brightness of the reflection nebula is thus higher and would be in even better agreement with the observations .",
    "we conclude that the reflection nebula around n30b is consistent with forward scattering by the dust grains , i.e. , n30b is on the near side of hen s22 .",
    "the most likely position of n30b is @xmath108 pc from hen s22 and the scattering angle @xmath1 is @xmath1040@xmath52 .",
    "the broad h@xmath1  line profiles from the reflection nebula around n30b not only change with position ( figure 7 ) but also differ from that of hen s22 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "adopting the most likely geometry of reflection suggested in  3.4 , @xmath66 8 pc and @xmath67 , the light travel time from hen s22 to us via the reflection nebula is 6 yrs longer than the direct travel time .",
    "thus the spectra of the reflection nebula should be compared to the spectra of hen s22 taken 6 yrs earlier ; unfortunately none are vailable with sufficient resolution .",
    "spectra of hen s22 available in the literature were taken from the late 1960 s to early 1980 s . while these observations yield a consistent systemic velocity of hen s22 , @xmath68 km  s@xmath3  @xcite , different blue - shifts ( from the systemic velocity ) of the absorption component in the hydrogen balmer lines",
    "have been reported : @xmath270 km  s@xmath3  derived from the h8 to h31 lines observed with a reciprocal dispersion of 20   mm@xmath3 in the years 19681975 @xcite , @xmath287 km  s@xmath3  from the h@xmath1  line observed with 38   mm@xmath3 in 1979 , and @xmath240 km  s@xmath3  from the h@xmath31 , h@xmath28 , and h@xmath29 lines observed with 20   mm@xmath3 in 1982 @xcite .",
    "since these measurements were made for different balmer lines with different spectral dispersion at different epochs , it is not clear whether the differences in the blue - shifts of the absorption component are caused by atmospheric effects ( low and high balmer lines have different profiles ) or temporal variations in the stellar wind .",
    "our echelle observations of hen s22 were made in 2000 january and december with a reciprocal dispersion of 3.4   mm@xmath3 .",
    "these two spectra show almost identical h@xmath1  profiles , with the absorption component detected at 260 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "relative to a systemic velocity of 293 km  s@xmath3 , the blue - shift of our h@xmath1  absorption is @xmath233 km  s@xmath3 . to compare our h@xmath1  profiles to",
    "that reported by @xcite , we have convolved our spectra with a gaussian with @xmath69 = 32 km  s@xmath3 , but we find that the overall h@xmath1  profiles do not match that presented in their figure 5 .",
    "this mismatch might be caused by an incorrect wavelength scale in their figure 5 , where the displacement of the absorption dip from the systemic velocity appears to be @xmath7050 km  s@xmath3 , significantly less than what they reported in their text .    from the above comparisons we find no conclusive or convincing evidence to indicate that the h@xmath1  line profile of hen s22 varied .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath18 magnitude and the @xmath45 color of hen s22 did not change for more than 0.1 mag from 1957 to 1996 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can not attribute the spatial variations of the broad h@xmath1  line from the refection nebula to hypothetical temporal variations of the h@xmath1  line of hen s22 .",
    "figure 7 shows smooth spatial variations of the broad h@xmath1  profile , especially the absorption component , across n30b , similar to what has been observed in car ii @xcite .",
    "the explanation of this spatial variation is best illustrated by the homunculus nebula of @xmath51 car , as described and analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the bipolar lobes of the homunculus are dusty and scatter the incident starlight of @xmath51 car ; the reflected spectra at higher latitudes show h@xmath1  absorption extending to larger blue - shifts .",
    "as the homunculus is smaller than 1 ly in size , temporal variations in the spectrum of @xmath51 car are negligible over the differential light travel time ; therefore , the latitude - dependence of the h@xmath1  absorption in the reflected spectra must indicate an anisotropic stellar wind from @xmath51 car .",
    "hen s22 has been shown to possess both a slow disk wind and a fast polar wind @xcite , consequently its spectral properties should also be latitude - dependent .",
    "thus , the variations in the absorption component in the reflected h@xmath1  emission at n30b must be a result of viewing hen s22 from different latitudes , too .",
    "the reflected spectra on the west side of n30b resemble better the observed h@xmath1  line of hen s22 , while those on the east side show the absorption component extending to larger blue - shifts , almost @xmath2100 km  s@xmath3  from hen s22 s systemic velocity of 293 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "these variations suggest that the east side of n30b views the wind of hen s22 from a higher latitude and the west side of n30b is close to the disk plane .",
    "the absorption component in the h@xmath1  line of a b[e ] star arises from the dense , disk component of the wind close to the star , as illustrated in the cartoon in figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "the variations of the absorption component in the reflected stellar h@xmath1  line emission across n30b thus offer an invaluable opportunity to study the transition from the disk component to the polar component of the stellar wind of a b[e ] star .",
    "future high - s / n , high - resolution spectroscopic observations and stellar atmospheric modeling are needed for a better understanding of the stellar wind of the hybrid - spectrum b[e ] supergiant hen s22 .",
    "@xmath0 wfpc2 h@xmath1  images reveal a bow - shock - like halo around the compact  regions in n30b on the side that faces the b[e ] supergiant hen s22 .",
    "long - slit , high - resolution spectroscopic observations of the h@xmath1  line show both narrow and broad emission components in n30b .",
    "the narrow component originates from the ionized gas in the  regions ; its velocity variations reveal a gas flow at @xmath25 to @xmath210 km  s@xmath3  relative to the  regions , indicating dynamic interactions with the stellar wind from hen s22 .",
    "the broad h@xmath1  emission component has the same spatial extent as the halo of n30b , but its width ( @xmath71000 km  s@xmath3 ) is too high to have been produced dynamically without detectable x - ray emission .",
    "the spectral shape of the broad h@xmath1  emission is similar to that of hen s22 , both having a blue - shifted absorption component .",
    "we suggest that the halo of n30b is a reflection nebula scattering the stellar emission of hen s22 .",
    "@xmath0 wfpc2 broad - band images show morphologies consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the bow - shock - like morphology is probably indeed formed as a bow shock , as the downstream flow velocity of @xmath25 to @xmath210 km  s@xmath3  is supersonic to the neutral gas in the halo of n30b .",
    "assuming typical properties of interstellar dust , we have modeled the surface brightness of the reflection nebula of n30b for a range of scattering angles .",
    "we find that the observed surface brightness of the reflection nebula in the wfpc2 @xmath16 band is within 20% from that expected from dust - scattering at a distance of @xmath108 pc from hen s22 for a scattering angle of @xmath1040@xmath52 .",
    "the absorption component in the broad h@xmath1  emission profile varies across the reflection nebula of n30b as a result of different viewing angles .",
    "the west side of n30b lies closer to the equatorial disk plane of hen s22 , while the east side of n30b is at higher latitudes .",
    "we suggest that the anisotropic wind of the b[e ] supergiant hen s22 can be studied by modeling the broad h@xmath1  line profile and the blue - shifted absorption component , taking into account the 3-dimensional geometry .",
    "this unique opportunity could reveal important insights on the physical conditions and evolution of these enigmatic massive stars .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for pointing out the existence of monitoring observations of @xmath51 car and its reflection nebula car ii .",
    "we also thank nathan smith and nolan walborn for useful discussions , jayanne english for suggesting deml106 to the hubble heritage project , and monica shaw for assistance in initial data analyses .",
