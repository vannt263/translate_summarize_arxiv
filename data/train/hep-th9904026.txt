    "although both gravity and gauge theories contain a local symmetry , they have rather disparate physical properties .",
    "qcd , for example , is a confining theory while gravity is not .",
    "similarly , in four dimensions qcd is renormalizable while field theories of gravity are non - renormalizable . nonetheless , within the context of the perturbative expansions some remarkable ` squaring ' relations exist between the tree - level @xmath3-matrix elements of gravity and gauge theories in both string and field theories  @xcite .",
    "these squaring relations imply that gauge symmetry is more closely related to the diffeomorphism invariance of gravity than one might suspect based on the respective lagrangians .",
    "recently , there has also been a resurgence of interest in perturbative gravity both in anti - de sitter spaces  @xcite and in phenomenological applications of large compact dimensions  @xcite , further motivating an investigation of these relations .    in this letter",
    "we will show that one can construct a low energy lagrangian for gravity directly from qcd @xmath3-matrix elements and then discuss how this lagrangian relates to the usual einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "the starting point of our investigation is the kawai , lewellen and tye ( klt ) relations expressing closed string tree amplitudes in terms of open string amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "these relations arise from the property that the integrand of a closed string amplitude is composed of left- and right - mover open string components ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the low energy limit where string theory reduces to field theory , the klt relations express gravity tree amplitudes in terms of a sum of products of",
    "` left ' gauge theory amplitudes and ` right ' gauge theory amplitudes .",
    "the klt relations were first exploited by berends , giele and kuijf to obtain an infinite sequence of maximally helicity violating pure gravity tree amplitudes  @xcite using known gauge theory results . by unitarity",
    ", tree - level relations necessarily imply that loop amplitudes in the two theories are also related .",
    "indeed , the method of constructing @xmath3-matrix elements via their analytic properties ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) provides a means for exploiting this to obtain loop - level ( super ) gravity amplitudes . using these ideas ,",
    "the divergence structure of @xmath4 supergravity has been investigated with the result that it appears to be less divergent than previously thought  @xcite .",
    "two infinite sequences of maximally helicity violating one - loop amplitudes in gravity theories have also been constructed  @xcite . these may be viewed as results in an effective field theory of gravity which necessarily must match the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory , such as string or @xmath5 theory .",
    "the ability to use the squaring relation between gravity and gauge theory to perform non - trivial gravity computations suggests that one can develop a deeper understanding of perturbative gravity by exploring this relationship .",
    "from the point of view of the field theory lagrangians , the klt relations are rather mysterious : the einstein - hilbert lagrangian does not factorize in any obvious way in terms of the yang - mills lagrangian .",
    "it is not even completely clear what the notion of ` left ' and ` right ' parts of the theory mean given that the graviton is a symmetric tensor .",
    "another obvious difficulty is that the yang - mills lagrangian has only three- and four - point interactions while the einstein - hilbert lagrangian has an infinite set of interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the gravity @xmath3-matrix does have the property that it is composed of products of two gauge theory amplitudes and that a graviton , very roughly speaking , is composed of ` left ' and ` right ' gauge fields , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "when one has a property of the @xmath3-matrix , a natural idea is to organize the underlying formalism so that it reflects that property . as a well known example , the general superiority of feynman diagrams as compared to time ordered perturbation theory follows from their preservation of manifest lorentz symmetry . here",
    "we wish to rearrange the gravity lagrangian so it captures properties associated with the factorization of the @xmath3-matrix into sums of products of gauge theory amplitudes .",
    "the analysis of this letter will consist of two parts . in the first part we will systematically construct a gravity lagrangian from qcd gluon amplitudes using the klt relations .",
    "we explicitly carry out the procedure through five graviton interactions ; in principle , the procedure can be carried out to arbitrarily high orders , although as a practical matter the complexity of the computations increases rapidly with the number of gravitons .",
    "nevertheless , the procedure shows that a lagrangian for gravity can be obtained using qcd amplitudes .",
    "the gravity lagrangian obtained in this way has the properties that ( a ) by construction it produces the correct tree - level amplitudes and ( b ) graviton lorentz indices associated with the ` left ' gauge theory do not contract with ones associated with the ` right ' gauge theory .",
    "a lagrangian with the property that the associated feynman diagrams factorize into left and right parts has been presented previously by siegel  @xcite . a spin - off from our analysis",
    "is that it can be used to provide a simpler set of gravity feynman rules than the conventional  @xcite de donder gauge rules .",
    "moreover , in our construction , the gravity three vertex is given directly as sums of squares of gauge theory vertices .",
    "in the second part , we will find a set of field variables which allows us to interpret the gravity lagrangian obtained from qcd in terms of the conventional einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "non - linear field redefinitions and gauge fixings have been used previously by van de ven  @xcite to simplify the computation of two - loop divergences in gravity . here",
    "we wish to consider such field redefinitions and gauge fixings in order to find a particular set of field variables which helps clarify the connection to qcd .",
    "this construction indicates that there is a closer correspondence between ordinary gauge invariance and the diffeomorphism invariance of einstein gravity than one might have suspected .",
    "a basic property of integrands for closed string amplitudes is that they factorize into open string integrands ( except for the momentum zero mode ) . at tree - level ,",
    "klt  @xcite used this property to find simple relationships expressing closed string amplitudes in terms of products of open string amplitudes . in the infinite string tension limit where string theory reduces to an effective field theory , for the four- and five - point",

    "color does not appear in these relations because the gauge theory partial amplitudes are independent of color .",
    "the arguments of the amplitudes label the external legs .",
    "these relations hold for any particle states appearing in any closed string theory since they follow from the basic factorization of the string integrands into ` left ' and ` right ' sectors .",
    "in particular , they hold in pure einstein gravity , gravity coupled to a dilaton , anti - symmetric tensor or gauge field , and in supergravity theories .",
    "moreover , these klt relations generalize to an arbitrary number of external legs .",
    "( explicit expressions may be found in appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite . ) a basic property of the klt formulas is that any lorentz indices associated with the ` left ' gauge theory amplitude do not contract with the lorentz indices of the ` right ' gauge theory amplitude .",
    "the klt relations give tree - level gravity amplitudes directly from known gauge theory amplitudes , which are generally far easier to compute .",
    "this was first applied by berends , giele and kuijf  @xcite to obtain an infinite sequence of maximally helicity violating @xmath12-point einstein gravity tree amplitudes using known qcd gluon amplitudes . beyond tree - level , one may exploit the klt relations using the cutting method developed for performing qcd amplitude calculations of phenomenological interest  @xcite . with this method",
    "one can reconstruct complete loop amplitudes ( in a given dimensional regularization scheme ) from their @xmath13-dimensional unitarity cuts .",
    "the one - loop amplitudes are specified in terms of tree amplitudes which satisfy the klt relations ; one can then obtain higher loop amplitudes by iterating the procedure . in this way , one can obtain loop - level ( super ) gravity @xmath3-matrix elements without reference to a lagrangian or feynman rules  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the computational method follows from the fact that one is _ recycling _ previously performed gauge theory calculations to obtain new results in gravity theories .    1.9 truein    -.3",
    "cm    for example , consider the unitarity cuts of a one - loop four - point amplitude in any gravity theory coming from the low energy limit of a string theory .",
    "as depicted in , a gravity tree amplitude appears on each side of the cut .",
    "thus , on the cut one must evaluate the product , @xmath14 summed over all states in the gravity theory that can cross the cut . from the klt relations ( [ kltexamples ] )",
    "we may re - express this product in terms of gauge theory amplitudes , @xmath15 the sum over the gravity theory states necessarily factorize into a sum over the states of two gauge theories because the underlying string theory has this property .",
    "this is a generic property holding for all cuts . in this way",
    ", one can re - express cut gravity amplitudes in terms of gauge theory ones .",
    "this has led to the construction of a number of non - trivial gravity loop amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss a procedure for constructing an off - shell low energy lagrangian for pure gravity starting from qcd gluon amplitudes .",
    "we explicitly carry this out for up to five graviton interactions . by construction ,",
    "the lagrangian that we obtain is equivalent to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian in that it produces identical tree - level @xmath3-matrix elements .    in field",
    "theory one usually takes a given lagrangian and constructs feynman rules that can then be used to obtain the @xmath3-matrix elements . here",
    "we wish to reverse this process , since from the klt relations we have the gravity @xmath3-matrix in terms of qcd amplitudes , but wish instead to obtain a lagrangian that preserves the ` left'-`right ' factorization of lorentz indices .    to obtain the @xmath12-graviton term in the lagrangian we start with the tree - level @xmath12-graviton amplitudes , given in terms of the qcd amplitudes , and subtract all diagrams containing up to @xmath16-graviton interaction vertices . by iterating this procedure we can systematically build a gravity lagrangian",
    ". however , to jump - start this process we first need a propagator and three vertex .",
    "consider the graviton propagator .",
    "the standard de donder gauge propagator , @xmath17 { i\\over k^2 + i\\eps } \\ , ,   \\equn\\label{dedonderpropagator}\\ ] ] is unacceptable since it contracts ` left ' and ` right ' indices ; for example , the last term contracts @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , it contains explicit dependence on the dimension @xmath13 , which must somehow cancel from the tree - level @xmath3-matrix elements since there is no such dependence in the klt relations or in the gauge theory amplitudes .",
    "( we have chosen @xmath20 to have signature @xmath21 . )",
    "a better propagator is  @xcite @xmath22 however , even this propagator is unacceptable because of the second term , which contracts a left index with a right one . to prevent such contractions , we wish to use instead the propagator , @xmath23 in a sense , for each graviton @xmath24 we assign the index @xmath18 to be a ` left ' index and @xmath19 to be a ` right ' index . of course",
    ", since @xmath24 is symmetric it does not matter which index is assigned to the left and which to the right , but once the choice is made we demand that left indices never contract with right ones . at first sight",
    "the gravity propagator ( [ newpropagator ] ) might seem rather peculiar since it appears to violate the fundamental property of the graviton being a symmetric tensor field . nevertheless , it is not difficult to show that one may use the propagator  ( [ newpropagator ] ) instead of  ( [ symmetricpropagator ] ) with no effect on the @xmath12-graviton @xmath3-matrix elements , provided that all vertices satisfy a _ rigid _ left ",
    "right interchange symmetry . by a rigid symmetry",
    "we mean that each @xmath12-point vertex be symmetric under a simultaneous interchange of all left and right lorentz indices , @xmath25 where the @xmath26 are the left indices associated with each graviton and the @xmath27 are the right indices .    with this requirement",
    ", one can show that there is no need to symmetrize the graviton propagator in the left and right indices .",
    "consider , for example , the diagram in .",
    "the external legs of the diagrams do not need to be explicitly symmetrized since the external graviton polarization tensors automatically symmetrize the legs .",
    "the interchange of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 indices can be undone by performing a rigid interchange of left and right indices on the left - most vertex .",
    "although the rigid interchange will also flip the indices on the external legs , this can be undone since the indices of each external leg are contracted with a symmetric tensor polarization .",
    "the same type of argument works for general diagrams .",
    "thus , the propagator ( [ newpropagator ] ) can be used instead of the propagator ( [ symmetricpropagator ] ) since the symmetrization of indices is automatically taken care of by the rigidly symmetrized vertices and by the symmetric polarization tensors on the external legs .",
    "1.2 truein    -.2 cm    given the propagator ( [ newpropagator ] ) we must also choose a three vertex .",
    "any three vertex which agrees on shell with the three - graviton vertex is suitable for our purposes .",
    "( kinematic restrictions prevent a massless particle from decaying into two others , but in terms of formal polarization tensors the vertex does not vanish ; below we shall also obtain the same vertex from the einstein - hilbert action . ) from string theory ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the on - shell three - graviton vertex can be expressed in terms of products of gauge theory vertices .",
    "this motivates the choice of the three graviton vertex , @xmath28\\ , , \\cr } \\equn\\label{gravityymthreevertex}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the color ordered gervais - neveu  @xcite yang - mills three vertex , from which the color factor has been stripped .",
    "our main reasons for using the vertex ( [ gravityymthreevertex ] ) is its simplicity and the fact that it makes the relationship to gauge theory manifest . by construction",
    ", this vertex is symmetric under the rigid interchange of left and right indices .",
    "armed with the propagator  ( [ newpropagator ] ) and the three vertex ( [ gravityymthreevertex ] ) we may then use the klt relations to find a gravity lagrangian using qcd gluon amplitudes as input . at the first step of the process one defines a four - vertex by subtracting from the four - point @xmath3-matrix obtained via the klt relations all diagrams containing a kinematic pole , as shown in .",
    "this four vertex automatically has the property that left lorentz indices do not contract with right ones , since the gravity @xmath3-matrix and diagrams containing the three - point vertex ( [ gravityymthreevertex ] ) have this property .",
    "moreover , the vertex defined in this way also has the rigid symmetry under an interchange of left and right indices .    3.8 truein    -.2 cm    we may then convert this four - vertex to an @xmath30 term in the lagrangian by inverting the usual procedure of obtaining feynman vertices from lagrangians .",
    "of course , there is some ambiguity in this process since one can always add terms which vanish on shell . as long as these terms",
    "do not mix left and right lorentz indices and satisfy a rigid left - right symmetry , which can always be imposed by hand , they are acceptable terms ; differences in the four - vertex then induce differences in the deduced higher - point vertices .",
    "once the four - graviton terms in the lagrangian have been chosen we can then continue the process to obtain a five vertex by subtracting from the five - graviton amplitude all diagrams containing three- and four - point vertices . in principle",
    ", one can continue in this way to an arbitrary number of external legs , allowing one to build a lagrangian for gravity order by order in perturbation theory using qcd gluon amplitudes . by construction",

    "the lagrangian ( [ gaugelagrangian ] ) does contain general coordinate invariance although it is not manifest since the symmetry has been gauge fixed . to make this explicit ,",
    "we now relate the lagrangian ( [ gaugelagrangian ] ) to the usual einstein - hilbert one . in order to do",
    "so we must first eliminate all terms in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian which contract left with right graviton indices , i.e , @xmath38 \\ , , \\equn\\label{badterms}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 \\equiv h_{\\mu_1 \\mu_2 } h_{\\mu_2 \\mu_3 } \\cdots h_{\\mu_n \\mu_1}$ ] . because of the way that these types of terms are tangled in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , it is not obvious how one can accomplish this .",

    "@xcite the dilaton was introduced to allow for a field redefinition which removes the graviton trace from the quadratic terms in the lagrangian .",

    "@xcite because we have chosen to normalize the dilaton kinetic term differently so as to slightly simplify the induced interaction terms discussed below . )    for the case of purely graviton external states the dilaton will not contribute to the tree - level @xmath3-matrix because of the selection rule that @xmath47 must be created or annihilated in pairs .",
    "of course , if the dilaton , or any matter fields appearing in the theory , are taken as external states they can propagate in intermediate states . in this case , one would need to specify the precise matter content of the theory before proceeding with the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the fundamental factorization of the @xmath3-matrix implied by the klt relations would still hold , since it follows from the underlying string theory .    here",
    "we wish to generalize the field redefinitions ( [ fieldredef ] ) to all orders in @xmath48 so as to remove all terms of the form ( [ badterms ] ) from the lagrangian .",

    "although the two lagrangians differ somewhat even after integrating out the auxiliary dilaton , we have explicitly shown that for up to five gravitons they generate the same on - shell scattering amplitudes .",
    "presumably , similar results can be obtained without introducing the dilaton ; nevertheless , we found it useful for clarifying the required reorganization of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "other reorganizations based on introducing other fields such as an anti - symmetric tensor , which is also motivated by string theory , are also possible  @xcite .",
    "at loop level there are also ghost contributions that can be obtained via the usual methods .",
    "( the jacobian generated by the field redefinition is trivial , at least in perturbation theory , since it is a point transformation . )",
    "additionally the auxiliary dilaton would propagate in the loops , which would then need to be subtracted ( see e.g. , ref .",

    "the unitarity method advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite is , however , an efficient way to obtain the @xmath3-matrix without the need for feynman rules .",
    "as one simple application , one may obtain the soft factor for gravity amplitudes directly from the soft behavior of qcd amplitudes .",
    "gravity tree amplitudes have the well known behavior  @xcite , @xmath62 as the momentum of graviton @xmath12 , which we have taken to carry positive helicity , becomes soft .",
    "using the three - graviton vertex ( [ gravityymthreevertex ] ) which is expressed in terms of the qcd three - gluon vertex , the gravity soft factor can then be expressed in terms of the qcd soft factor : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the eikonal factor for a positive helicity soft gluon in qcd .",
    "the @xmath65 are spinor inner products and @xmath66 are massless weyl spinors of momentum @xmath67 , labeled with the sign of the helicity ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "although not manifest , the soft factor ( [ finalsoftgrav ] ) is independent of the choices of null helicity ` reference momenta ' @xmath68 and @xmath69 . by choosing @xmath70 and @xmath71 we recover the form of the soft graviton factor for @xmath72 used in , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite .    as a less trivial example",
    ", the explicit factorization of the left and right indices of the interaction vertices would imply that the all - plus helicity graviton current satisfying eqs .",
    "( b.10 ) and ( b.11 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite do actually follow from einstein gravity . in ref .",
    "@xcite the hitch in obtaining these recursion relations from einstein gravity was the different choices of helicity reference momenta on the left and on the right .",
    "( although , not derived directly from einstein gravity these recursion relations were useful for defining ` half - soft ' functions which serve as building blocks for one - loop gravity amplitudes . ) in this case , @xmath73 , which prevented a derivation of the recursion relations from einstein gravity . with the factorization of left and right lorentz indices ,",
    "such contractions simply do not occur .",
    "since the tree - level @xmath3-matrix is generated by solving perturbatively the classical equations of motion , one might suspect that it is possible to relate more general solutions of the classical equations of motion for gravity to gauge theory solutions .",
    "the property that the @xmath3-matrix can be expressed in terms of ` left ' and ` right ' sectors is generic in string theory .",
    "for this reason , it should be possible to extend the discussion in this letter to theories containing , for example , the anti - symmetric tensor or to supergravity theories .",
    "it also seems reasonable that gravity theories in curved spaces can be reformulated to express tree - level amplitudes in terms of gauge theory ones .",
    "moreover , the intimate connection of perturbative gravity amplitudes with gauge theory ones suggests a closer connection of diffeomorphism invariance with non - abelian gauge symmetry than one might have suspected .",
    "we feel that these issues deserve further attention .",
