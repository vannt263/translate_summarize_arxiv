    "coherent elastic neutrino - nucleus scattering is a well - predicted standard model interaction that is of wide - spread interest .",
    "characterizing the process can provide a probe of beyond the standard model physics , such as through non - standard neutrino interactions  @xcite , and can contribute to our understanding of supernova dynamics . although experiments have been proposed to search for this channel  @xcite , neutrino - nucleus coherent elastic scattering has never been observed .",
    "this paper shows that , for existing proposed layouts of neutrino sources and ton - scale dark matter detectors , discovery of coherent neutrino scattering can occur with a 2  ton@xmath0year exposure under an optimistic detection scenario . along with coherent neutrino physics ,",
    "the observation of rare , wimp - like events with a well predicted flux ( shape and absolute normalization ) and cross section in a well - known time window can provide a cross - check of the sensitivity and efficiency of dark matter detectors .",
    "furthermore , in the case that a substantial event sample is collected with a dedicated experiment close to the neutrino source , sensitivity to physics beyond the standard model and a unique probe of @xmath1 can be obtained through a coherent neutrino scattering cross section measurement .",
    "we discuss the physics importance of the coherent neutrino interaction in the next section and detection methods in section  [ sec : detection ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discovery ] provides our assumptions for a few example experiments and the raw rates in these detectors with various exposures and as a function of envisioned energy thresholds and baseline lengths .",
    "the effect of coherent events as a background for wimp interactions is also considered .",
    "then , we consider the scenario in which a detector module is brought within tens of meters of the neutrino source and used to obtain a high statistics sample of events for coherent neutrino physics ( section  [ sec : closedetector2 ] ) .",
    "the coherent scattering cross section , @xmath2 , depends on the number of neutrons , @xmath3 , and protons , @xmath4 , of the target material with mass @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 is the recoil energy of the interaction and the incoming neutrino has energy @xmath7 , @xmath8    in this equation , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the precisely known fermi constant and weak charge [ @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the form factor , @xmath12 , dominates the @xmath135% cross section uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "as the cross section is well predicted , coherent elastic neutrino - nucleus scattering is an ideal source to search for new physics in the neutrino sector .",
    "a cross section measurement with @xmath1310% uncertainty will result in an uncertainty on @xmath1 of @xmath135%  @xcite . while this uncertainty is large compared to existing and planned precision atomic parity violation and mller scattering measurements , a discrepancy from the standard model prediction already observed in the neutrino sector by the nutev experiment  @xcite motivates more neutrino - based measurements .",
    "notably , a @xmath1 measurement with coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering would be at @xmath14  gev / c , well away from all previous neutrino scattering measurements ( including nutev s at @xmath15  gev / c ) .",
    "a coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering cross section measurement agreement within 10% uncertainty of the standard model prediction will result in limits on non - standard neutrino interactions ( nsi ) which improve on the present ones by more than an order of magnitude  @xcite . the low-@xmath16 existing and planned precision measurements mentioned above are not sensitive to new physics unique to neutrino interactions .",
    "nsi terms can enter the standard model lagrangian through an extra term , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a first generation standard model fermion , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath23 terms can appear due to a range of sources , including incorporating neutrino mass into the standard model  @xcite and supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 terms , in particular , are poorly constrained by existing measurements . measuring a coherent scattering cross section in disagreement with the standard model expectation",
    "could be an indication of nsi . in the case that a cross section discrepancy is observed , multiple nuclear targets could be employed in order to disentangle effects from nsi , a @xmath1 anomaly ( e.g. consistent with nutev ) , and/or nuclear physics .    characterizing neutrino coherent scattering is also essential to the understanding of supernova evolution as the energy carried away by neutrinos comprises @xmath1399% of the supernova s total energy and the coherent channel s cross section exceeds all others by at least an order of magnitude in the relevant energy region . in a stellar core collapse",
    ", the density of the electron / nucleus plasma at the core can reach @xmath26@xmath27  @xmath28 . at these densities ,",
    "a 20  mev neutrino s mean free path is on the order of 0.5  km  @xcite with the opacity in nucleus - rich regions dominated by coherent scattering .",
    "along with being relevant for supernova evolution in general , the coherent cross section may also affect the supernova neutrino signals expected on earth .",
    "the coherent process is important for supernova burst neutrino detection as well , providing information about all flavors of neutrinos  not just @xmath29/@xmath30 . for coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering specifically , unlike other channels of flavor - blind neutral current interactions , the nuclear recoil energy is proportional to neutrino energy due to the elastic nature of the interaction .",
    "such information could be combined with charged current @xmath29/@xmath30 interaction information from other sources to develop a complete picture of oscillations with supernova neutrinos .",
    "note that approximately seven neutrino - nucleus coherent events in one ton of ar during a ten second window for a galactic core - collapse supernova at 10  kpc are expected with a recoil energy threshold of 5  kev  @xcite .",
    "although the detectors discussed below are probably too small to provide a sizable sample of supernova burst neutrino - nucleus coherent scatters ( unless the supernova is very close ) , an accelerator - based measurement to confirm the predicted interaction cross section would prove valuable to a next - generation coherent neutrino scattering experiment s supernova burst neutrino measurement .",
    "the coherent neutrino - nucleus cross section favors very low recoil energies , in the few - to - tens of kev range .",
    "this is well below the threshold of the most sensitive recent and existing large - scale low energy neutrino detectors , like sno  @xcite , borexino  @xcite , and kamland  @xcite , which explains why this relatively high cross section process has not yet been observed .",
    "dark matter detectors , on the other - hand , have energy thresholds in the @xmath1310  kev range and lower . as such , these detectors are potentially ideal coherent neutrino scattering detectors if given a sufficiently large target mass and neutrino flux",
    ". a ton - scale dark matter detector at its nominal depth underground of  1 - 2 km , in combination with an intense decay - at - rest ( dar ) neutrino source , could discover the coherent neutrino scattering process .",
    "it is worth noting that dark matter detectors could observe @xmath31b solar neutrino coherent events , as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "the @xmath31b rate depends on the detector threshold and material , with more events for lighter target nuclei and lower thresholds .",
    "this solar neutrino signal becomes negligible for high-@xmath32 targets when the low - energy recoil threshold of the experiment is between 5 and 10  kev or more .",
    "there are zero solar coherent events expected with a 5/10  kev threshold for the targets ( xe , ge / ar ) and exposures considered here . in contrast , the dar accelerator source described in section  [ sec : discovery ] will produce a significant number of events within a well - defined time window when the accelerator is on .",
    "these events can therefore only be considered a wimp background during those times ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : wimpsearch ] ) . in terms of a coherent neutrino physics measurement",
    ", the accelerator - based case has the luxury of an _ in - situ _ background measurement ( when the source is off ) in addition to the higher - energy , above - threshold nuclear recoils .",
    "in order to be reasonably concrete , we study a set of experimental designs inspired by proposals for the deep underground science and engineering laboratory ( dusel ) .",
    "we note that the detector designs are not very different from those under consideration at other underground laboratories and that the results can be easily scaled . for the neutrino source",

    "each 1 mw accelerator will provide @xmath38 neutrinos of each flavor per year produced as an isotropic flux within the time window , expected to be about 67  ms out of 500  ms for the near accelerator with the current design  @xcite .",
    "the absolute normalization of the neutrino flux , determined with electron - neutrino elastic scattering ( @xmath39 ) as measured by ultra - large water cerenkov detector(s ) , will have a systematic uncertainty of 1% with dominant contributions from the cross section and energy scale uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the statistical uncertainty on the flux depends on the run period , but is expected to be on the order of 1% as well .",
    "the near accelerator site is envisioned at or near the surface of the laboratory with the other cyclotrons located many kilometers away .",
    "note that the far sites will produce insignificant coherent rates due to the 1/@xmath40 dependence of the flux .",

    "the total expected background rate during the 13% of beam - on time would therefore be 0.15  events/(4.5  ton@xmath0year ) for the baseline and 0.17  events/(4.5  ton@xmath0year ) for the optimistic scenario .",

    "the cyclotron would then be located just outside the tunnel in a building against the cliff face .",
    "as discussed earlier , a coherent cross section measurement is sensitive to a number of physics possibilities . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a flux - integrated total cross section measurement as our figure of merit .",
    "however , the shape of the cross section as a function of energy is also interesting , especially in the case that a measured total cross section is inconsistent with expectation .    although many low - threshold nuclear - recoil - sensitive detector technologies could work ( including a noble liquid detector  @xcite or other dark matter detector technology ) , for concreteness we consider the specific example of a set of geodm - derived detectors with 16.7  kg raw mass , 20  m away from the stopped - pion neutrino source . with the optimistic efficiency estimate ( figure  [ efficiency ] ) and a fiducial mass of 10  kg , we expect a detected coherent rate of 0.74  events/(10  kg@xmath0day ) within the 13% beam - on time window .",
    "the background rate design goal for such an experiment would be @xmath330.1  events/(10  kg@xmath0day ) within the same window .",
    "this rate seems reasonable with @xmath13300  ft of rock shielding along with modest passive / active shielding immediately surrounding the detector for prompt cosmic - ray - induced background attenuation / tagging .",
    "the radiogenic background is assumed negligible , at a rate consistent with geodm deep underground .",
    "the uncertainty on the non - beam related background estimate will easily be statistics - dominated with an @xmath62 background measurement during beam - off .",
    "we also assume that there are no background events from neutrons produced by the dar neutrino source at a 20  m baseline with 17  m rock and 3  m fe shielding .",
    "this assumption was justified by performing a geant4  @xcite simulation of an isotropic neutron source along a 20  m baseline , fitting the flux at various distances from the neutron source to the functional form @xmath63 where @xmath32 and @xmath64 are fit parameters and @xmath65 is the distance along the baseline .",
    "the rate from this fit was extrapolated to 20  m distance and a 50  kg@xmath0year exposure , and the number of neutron events was found to be negligible .",

    "dark matter detectors can double as coherent neutrino scattering experiments as the products of wimp and coherent scattering interactions are predicted to be nearly identical . in the case of a decay - at - rest neutrino source and a suite of dark matter experiments at the same site , the deep underground detectors there would merely need to receive a beam timing signal in order to participate in the coherent search .",
    "furthermore , these detectors would receive a free dark matter detection consistency check in the form of non - wimp rare events in a well - known time window  all with a modest cost to the wimp analysis / exposure .",
    "the power of this consistency check is strongly dependent on the number of coherent neutrino events collected , a value which is expected to be fairly low in most configurations . in both optimistic and baseline detection scenarios , the best limit on the wimp - nucleon cross section uses only data from the period when the dar source is off . in the optimistic scenario ,",
