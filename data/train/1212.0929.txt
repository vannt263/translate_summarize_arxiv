    "recently , searches for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson at both the atlas and cms experiments have furnished compelling evidence for a new particle consistent with a higgs boson , having a mass near 125 gev  @xcite .",
    "both collaborations report an apparent excess of events in the @xmath13 channel and the @xmath14 channel . at the same time",
    ", searches in the channel @xmath15 have excluded a sm higgs boson at the @xmath16 confidence level for masses above @xmath17 gev and combined searches exclude from 110 to 122.6 gev  @xcite .",
    "results from lep ii preclude the mass region below @xmath18 gev  @xcite .",
    "the lhc is now taking data for its 2012 run at a center of mass ( cm ) energy of 8 tev , after which it is planned to be offline for a year before an upgraded run in 2014 .    with the detection of this new particle , the higgs program at the lhc moves into a new phase of testing to determine the properties of the particle in as much detail as possible .",
    "for this mass range , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 channels should continue to provide the best mass resolution . however , it is worthwhile to consider all potential channels which can make any significant contribution , both to refine our results with additional data and to test the consistency of any discovery with the standard model or its variations .    towards this end",
    "we consider the potential for detection of the higgs decaying to @xmath21 , where one @xmath0 decays hadronically and one leptonically , @xmath22 or @xmath2 .",
    "this channel has previously been considered for the tevatron and the lhc , but generally not for such a low higgs mass  @xcite .",
    "the atlas collaboration has released the results of a search in this channel with @xmath23 of data at 7 tev , focusing on the 300 to 600 gev mass range , for which they find no significant excess , although this channel by itself does not yet exclude the expected standard model cross - section  @xcite .",
    "cms finds no evidence for a higgs in the range 170 to 600 gev and excludes a sm higgs for 230 - 480 gev  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we will consider the lower mass range consistent with the announced discovery .",
    "the @xmath2 signal presents some difficulties in this relatively low mass range .",
    "first , it is clearly well below the nominal @xmath24 production threshold , so that a resonantly produced higgs boson will decay with at least one @xmath0 far below its mass shell .",
    "this means that @xmath24 is not the leading branching fraction and our signal is smaller than it would be at higher masses . on the other hand , as we shall see , this far - off - shell case presents some kinematic characteristics which can help distinguish it from the backgrounds .",
    "the second problem is that introducing jets in our signal inevitably involves dealing with large qcd backgrounds .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath15 is currently being searched and has already yielded strong upper limits on a sm higgs .",
    "this channel has the advantage of having primarily backgrounds from weak interactions .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of two neutrinos limits our ability to reconstruct the event kinematics .",
    "allowing one of the @xmath0s to decay hadronically means we must contend with the large @xmath25 background , but has the advantage of including only one neutrino in the signal .",
    "although the single neutrino still presents us with an unmeasured momentum , we can determine its components as described in our analysis and identify a characteristic mass peak near the physical higgs mass nonetheless .",
    "we estimate the rates for the signal and the background with appropriate cuts and show that this channel ( @xmath8 ) can contribute a @xmath6 statistical significance by itself with @xmath26 tev and an integrated luminosity ( @xmath4 ) of 25 fb@xmath5 for the 2012 running in each experiment ( atlas or cms ) at the lhc .",
    "we also find that an independent @xmath7 discovery of a 125 gev higgs boson in this channel can be achieved for the design cm energy of 14  tev with @xmath27 .",
    "additionally , we consider a proposal by sullivan and menon to augment this channel with the development of c - tagging algorithms  @xcite . we show that with ideally perfect c - tagging , one could potentially increase the significance of the signal in 2012 data to @xmath28 . with modest assumptions for c - tagging performance",
    "we find only marginal improvements to the statistical significance , although the ratio of signal to background would be improved .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the characteristics of the signal and the background for @xmath8 .",
    "section iii presents our strategy to reconstruct the higgs signal for the final state with one neutrino .",
    "sections iv and v describe details of our simulations and acceptance cuts .",
    "promising results are shown in section vi , and prospects with c - tagging are discussed in section vii .",
    "optimistic conclusions are drawn in section viii .",
    "for a typical signal event of @xmath8 , a higgs particle near its mass shell ( in the 125 gev region ) will decay into two @xmath0 bosons .",
    "one of these will be essentially on - shell while the other will be highly virtual , with an invariant mass roughly equal to @xmath29 gev .",
    "either the hadronically or leptonically decaying @xmath0 may be the on - shell particle and the events are approximately evenly distributed between these two cases .",
    "the dominant physics background for our signal is @xmath25 where the jets are produced by qcd processes .",
    "thus , before any selection cuts , the background is typically an on - shell leptonically decaying @xmath0 and a pair of jets which can fake a second @xmath0 whether real or virtual .",
    "the dijet invariant mass distribution is , to first order , a smoothly falling function for the qcd background .",
    "hence , to minimize background we select events with a higher dijet invariant mass and a leptonic invariant mass which is far from the on - shell @xmath0 mass . therefore we will concentrate on the half of the signal with an on - shell @xmath0 decaying into two jets and a virtual leptonically decaying @xmath0 .",
    "the neutrino momentum is not directly measured so we must make some assumptions to reconstruct the leptonic @xmath0 or the higgs invariant mass . previous analysis have often used the assumption that the neutrino comes from an on - shell @xmath0 , which is not suitable for our case .",
    "we will assume that the transverse neutrino momentum can be approximated by the missing transverse energy ( @xmath30 ) , computed from the sum of all detected particles .",
    "the higgs invariant mass can be approximately located by using the cluster transverse mass  @xcite , defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the invariant mass of the 2-jet plus charged lepton system .",
    "this quantity can be understood as the invariant mass constructed from the known momenta ( assuming @xmath30 for the transverse neutrino momentum ) with the longitudinal neutrino momentum chosen so as to minimize it .",
    "equivalently , it corresponds to the invariant mass at an endpoint in the physically allowed parameter space with real momenta .",
    "we will use this principle to reconstruct the neutrino s longitudinal momentum as detailed in section iii .",
    "the cluster transverse mass is particularly useful in this scenario because of the low higgs mass in comparison to the real @xmath24 diboson mass . for the signal ,",
    "the actual invariant mass of the @xmath2 system is typically near the minimum value allowed by the visible particles plus @xmath30 .",
    "as we raise cuts on the energy of the jets or the leptons , so long as we do not move beyond the range of energies the signal can produce , the @xmath2 invariant mass will still be at the relatively low mass , typical of the higgs resonance , and @xmath33 will be a good approximation to the actual mass . for the background , higher cuts on the produced particles will favor a higher @xmath33 since there is no resonance which keeps a low minimum invariant mass as a physical solution .",
    "the signal also has a characteristic spin structure which we consider as a potential discriminant against background  @xcite . in our higgs signal ,",
    "the higgs boson is a scalar decaying into vector bosons with opposite spins and those @xmath0 bosons couple only to left - handed particles in their decays . as a result",
    ", the up - type quark coming from the decay of one @xmath0 will tend to be aligned with the charged lepton coming from the other , while the down - type quark will tend to be aligned with the neutrino .",
    "in general we do not know which jet originates from the up - type quark , but we can still try to select for events where one jet is aligned and the other anti - aligned with respect to the charged lepton .",
    "this phenomenon can be characterized by the angles @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath34 is defined as the angle between the @xmath37 and the @xmath38 decay planes in the rest frame of the higgs .",
    "@xmath35 is the angle in the rest frame of the hadronically decaying @xmath0 between the leading jet ( in energy ) and the direction of boost from the higgs rest frame .",
    "@xmath39 is similarly defined , with the charged lepton in place of the leading jet .",
    "the signal is maximized for @xmath40 and for @xmath41 .",
    "as discussed above , we can use the cluster transverse mass @xmath42 to approximate the resonance peak of the higgs . assuming the neutrino transverse momentum @xmath43",
    "can be identified with the missing transverse energy for the event , this is equivalent to choosing the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the energy and 3-momentum of the sum over the three visible particles @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the same concept can be applied to the transverse mass @xmath50 often used with leptonically decaying @xmath0 s : @xmath51 where @xmath52 this method of assigning neutrino momentum is essentially the same as in the modified maos ( mt2 assisted on - shell ) method detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite for use with two invisible particles .    since we expect a low invariant mass ( @xmath53 ) for the virtual @xmath0 from higgs decay , @xmath54 and its associated @xmath55 value can also work as signal discriminant .",
    "let us call the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino in the first scheme above @xmath56 and in the second @xmath57 . in general @xmath56 will perform slightly better for reconstructing the higgs mass near its true peak and @xmath57 is slightly better for @xmath0 reconstruction , particularly at higher values of @xmath58 .",
    "we have also considered an intermediate , weighted case using the prescription @xmath59k_t } { \\sqrt { [ e^{vis } m_t(w)^2 + e^\\ell m_c(h)^2]^2   -[p^{viz}_z m_t(w)^2 + p^\\ell_z m_c(h)^2]^2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which approximately minimizes the product @xmath60 when used in reconstructions . in practice ,",
    "after cuts to select the mass peaks , there are only small differences in the distributions resulting from using @xmath61 or @xmath62 . in our analysis",
    ", we assign the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino according to @xmath56 , which appears to give us slightly better signal discrimination than the other options .",
    "@xmath56 gives the sharpest edge to the higgs mass peak and also performs well for the @xmath0 reconstruction in the far below shell region we are selecting .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations for the signal and the background events using the madgraph5 package  @xcite .",
    "our typical signal jets do not have particularly high momentum so we are sensitive to contamination from initial - state radiation . to control this , and to have a better estimate of signal and background shapes , we use the built - in mlm - style matching scheme .",
    "this option combines matrix element and showering routines in a consistent way to avoid over - counting .",
    "we include up to one additional jet at the matrix element level in both signal and background .",
    "showering and hadronization is performed by the event generator pythia  @xcite , after which our events are passed to the delphes fast detector simulation for reconstruction  @xcite . at the delphes level , we define our jets according to the cambridge - aachen ( c - a ) algorithm with a size parameter of @xmath63 .",
    "we require at least one isolated lepton ( @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) in each event and take the leading lepton in transverse momentum ( @xmath66 ) as our candidate from the leptonic @xmath0 decay .",
    "since delphes includes electrons in its listing of jets , we subtract the lepton momentum from any jet within a @xmath67 cone in @xmath68 and recombine any remaining momentum according to the c - a prescription .",
    "the transverse momenta of our jets are typically @xmath69 gev or less .",
    "energy loss from hadronization , reconstruction and detector effects can be significant for jets in this momentum range . to ameliorate this",
    "we apply a jet - energy correction factor according to the pseudo - rapidity and magnitude of the momentum of each candidate jet .",
    "this correction factor is based on comparison between jets at reconstruction level and quarks / gluons at parton level when they can be well matched , averaged over a large number of background and signal simulated events . for jets with momentum",
    "@xmath70 gev this can be an order one correction .",
    "we apply a similar correction procedure to the charged lepton , although that is only a small adjustment .",
    "as noted above , the background is dominated by @xmath25 production .",
    "we separate this into two pieces , a leading qcd piece with only two electroweak vertices , and a sub - leading piece with four electroweak vertices which includes non - higgs - generated @xmath71 events .",
    "we also consider @xmath72 events .",
    "the higgs signal is produced primarily through gluon fusion , which is implemented in madgraph via an effective theory derived from one loop calculations with the top quark .",
    "however , the total production is significantly enhanced at higher order , suggesting a k - factor of @xmath73 compared to our leader order ( lo ) simulations . to take this into account we scale our signal results for @xmath74 up to match the higher order ( nnlo ) results , which find a production cross - section of @xmath75 pb at 8 tev and @xmath76 pb at 14 tev  @xcite",
    "we provide results for a 123 , 125 and 127 gev higgs in table i. for the 123 gev and 127 gev cases we assume the same scaling as for @xmath77 gev .    for the backgrounds ,",
    "we have made use of the mcfm program suite for computing @xmath25 at the next - to - leading - order ( nlo )  @xcite .",
    "we impose a @xmath66 cut of 5 or 10 gev and require an invariant mass cut 55 gev @xmath78 105 gev for the nlo results .",
    "we impose the same mass cut for our madgraph lo plus matching simulation .",
    "the matching algorithm has an implicit cutoff @xmath79 gev which defines the boundary between matrix element and showering effects . at 7 tev",
    "the nlo and lo+matching cross - sections agree quite well and are stable when varying the @xmath66 cut between 5 and 10 gev . at 14 tev",
    "the nlo estimates are approximately @xmath80 higher than lo + matching , although with estimated errors of the same order . for",
    "the results presented below we do not apply a k - factor beyond our lo + matching calculations for our @xmath25 backgrounds . for the @xmath72 background",
    "we include a k - factor of 2 .",
    "figure  1 shows invariant mass distributions ( @xmath81 ) with basic cuts : @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 gev , @xmath84 , and 55 gev @xmath78 105 gev . in each event",
    ", we assume that there are two jets and one isolated leptons as well as missing transverse energy from a neutrino . in this figure",
    ", we present the reconstructed masses for the signal with @xmath77 gev and for the background from @xmath25 .     with basic cuts on @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath58 for ( a ) the higgs signal from @xmath87 with @xmath88 125 gev ( blue solid ) , and ( b ) the dominant physics background ( red dash ) from @xmath89 .",
    "we have normalized the cross section for both the signal and the background .",
    "[ fig : hww_mass ] ]",
    "we apply a series of acceptance cuts to improve the statistical significance .",
    "we first require that all events have at least two jets and one isolated charged lepton .",
    "after jet - energy corrections , the first and second leading jets by transverse momentum are required to have @xmath90 gev and @xmath91 gev .",
    "the invariant mass of this jet pair ( @xmath58 ) must be between @xmath92 and @xmath93 gev .",
    "conversely , the charged lepton must have a transverse momentum @xmath94 gev , and the missing transverse energy @xmath30 can be capped at @xmath29 gev .",
    "we consider jets with a pseudo - rapidity @xmath95 and require the charged lepton to have @xmath96 .    with these inputs",
    "we reconstruct the longitudinal neutrino momentum as described above and equate the neutrino transverse momentum to @xmath30 . using this assumption",
    "we can calculate the momentum of @xmath97 , the leptonically decaying weak boson , and @xmath98 , the candidate higgs boson .",
    "in addition , we impose the following cuts :    * @xmath99 gev , * @xmath100 gev , * @xmath101 , and * @xmath102 gev ,    where @xmath103 is the energy of the leptonically decaying @xmath0 in its rest frame . with these cuts",
    "applied , the remaining background is kinematically similar to the signal , although the signal s characteristic peaks are somewhat sharper .",
    "further tightening the cuts can reduce the ratio of signal to background but generally reduces the statistical significance due to loss of signal .",
    "we do not find that angular correlations in the variables @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are sufficiently distinct from the background to improve our results .",
    "with the procedures and cuts discussed above , we present our estimates of signal and background rates in table i. we consider two cases : the lhc 2012 running at @xmath104 tev cm energy , and the planned lhc running at a target cm energy of 14 tev . for 14",
    "tev we raise the @xmath66 cut on the second jet to @xmath105 gev .",
    "the results include a signal calculated for input higgs masses of 123 , 125 , and 127 gev .",
    "we use the same cuts and one can see in table i that the difference in expected signal events is small , although slightly increasing for higher masses .",
    "this is owing to the increasing @xmath24 branching fraction as the higgs mass increases , an effect which it mitigated by the decreasing efficiency of the @xmath106 gev cut as the signal peak moves up in mass .",
    "obviously , this cut would drastically reduce our signal for masses much larger than those considered .",
    "[ sigma1 ]    .cross section of @xmath87 in fb at the lhc with all acceptance cuts for three values of @xmath107 and 127 gev and two values of cm energy ( a ) @xmath108 8 tev and ( b ) @xmath108 14 tev . also shown",
    "are the contributions from dominant physics backgrounds and the statistical significance for the higgs signal with an integrated luminosity of 25 fb@xmath5 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the table above",
    "one can see that c - tagging does potentially improve our statistical significance , as well as improving the ratio of signal to background .",
    "however , realizing this potential would require excellent c - tagging acceptance while keeping the ratio @xmath109 low .",
    "in the ideal case , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we would have @xmath28 at @xmath26 tev based on statistical uncertainty . at @xmath9",
    "tev a @xmath112 detection could be made with @xmath113 .",
    "on the other hand , let us consider the more modest but still optimistic case where c - tagging has a similar performance to current b - tagging . if @xmath114 with @xmath115 , our nominal significance with 2012 data would be @xmath116 , virtually the same as the untagged case .",
    "however , the signal to background ratio would be improved to @xmath117 .",
    "thus an efficient c - tagging can reduce our sensitivity to background systematics . at @xmath9",
    "tev the statistical significance would be somewhat worse than the untagged case , requiring @xmath118 for a @xmath112 result .",
    "this is because the background after c - tagged cuts , especially the @xmath119 component , grows more quickly with increasing beam energy than the overall background with untagged cuts .",
    "in this letter we have investigated the discovery channel @xmath8 for a standard model higgs with a mass of 125  gev , consistent with recent lhc results .",
    "we have demonstrated that by selecting for an on - shell hadronically decaying @xmath0 paired with a far - off - shell leptonic decaying @xmath0 , combined with transverse - mass based reconstruction techniques , one can reduce the large @xmath25 backgrounds to a workable level .",
    "based on monte carlo simulations we estimate that the 2012 run of the lhc could provide evidence for this channel at the @xmath6 level with an integrated luminosity of 25  fb@xmath5 based on statistical uncertainty . at the design energy of 14 tev",
    ", @xmath7 significance could be achieved with @xmath120 of data . however",
    ", this analysis does not include a full estimation of systematic uncertainties which will play an important roll given the small ratio of signal to background .",
    "careful study of the @xmath25 background will be required to make this channel feasible .",
    "nonetheless , our results are promising .",
    "we also considered the prospects for c - tagging to improve our results .",
    "we find that exceptional c - tagging capabilities , with high acceptance and good rejection of light jets , could yield somewhat improved statistical significance .",
    "however , with more realistic assumptions for c - tagging efficiencies , we would have at best marginal improvement in terms of significance . on the other hand ,",
    "the increased signal to background ratio is a distinct advantage of this scenario .",
    "we note that our study is based on a simulation of traditional calorimeter - based jets . due to the relatively low energy of our typical jets , we are quite sensitive to loss of resolution from energy loss and uncertainty in jet - energy corrections .",
    "this limits our ability to pick out the pronounced hadronic decaying @xmath0 mass peak and the higgs transverse mass peak .",
    "a study with particle - flow based jet reconstruction may well be able to improve on our findings .",
