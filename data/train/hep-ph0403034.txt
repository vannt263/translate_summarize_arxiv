    "radiative @xmath6 decays into kaons provide abundant issues for both theorists and experimentalists .",
    "after the first measurement at cleo , @xmath7 is now also measured in belle and babar : @xmath8 theoretical advances in @xmath7 have been noticeable for a decade .",
    "qcd corrections at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of @xmath9 was already considered in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , relevant wilson coefficients have been improved @xcite up to three - loop calculations .",
    "recent developments of the qcd factorization @xcite helped one calculate the hard spectator contributions systematically in a factorized form through the convolution at the heavy quark limit @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 is also analyzed in the effective theories at nlo , such as large energy effective theory @xcite and the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath10 , higher resonances of kaon also deserve much attention .",
    "especially , it was suggested that @xmath11 can provide a direct measurement of the photon polarization @xcite . in particular , it was shown that @xmath12 can produce large polarization asymmetry of @xmath13 in the standard model . in the presence of anomalous right - handed couplings , the polarization can be severely reduced in the parameter space allowed by current experimental bounds of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that the @xmath6 factories can now make a lot of @xmath15 pairs enough to check the anomalous couplings through the measurement of the photon polarization .    as for the axial @xmath2 , unfortunately , current measurements give only upper bounds for @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath16 for the decays of @xmath17 , cleo and the @xmath6 factories have reported the branching ratios @xmath18 since the higher resonant kaons are rather heavy @xmath19 , it is quite natural and attractive to consider them as heavy mesons .",
    "the advent of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) provoked many studies .",
    "although the hqet simplifies the analysis by reducing number of the independent form factors involved , other non - perturbative methods are needed to complete the phenomenological explanation .",
    "these hqet - based analyses include hqet - isgw ( isgur - scora - grinstein - wise ) @xcite and hqet - nrqm ( non - relativistic quark model ) @xcite .",
    "other model calculations have been done in @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the branching ratios of @xmath0 at nlo of @xmath1 are calculated .",
    "we adopt the qcd factorization framework where the hard spectator interactions are described by the convolution between the hard - scattering kernel and the lint - cone distribution amplitudes ( da ) at the heavy quark limit .",
    "all the non - perturbative nature are encapsulated in the da while the hard kernel is perturbatively calculable .",
    "basically , @xmath0 shares many things with @xmath7 .",
    "only the difference is the da for the daughter mesons .",
    "vector and axial vector mesons are distinguished by the @xmath20 in the gamma structure of da and some non - perturbative parameters .",
    "but the presence of @xmath20 does not alter the calculation , giving the same result for the perturbative part .",
    "as for the non - perturbative parameters , the decay constant is most important . if higher twist terms are included , the gegenbauer moments in the gegenbauer expansion are also process dependent .",
    "we will not consider higher twists for simplicity .",
    "another nlo contributions are the vertex corrections to the relevant operators .",
    "they are all proportional to the leading operator @xmath21 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath21 are parameterized by several form factors . for the radiative",
    "decays where the emitted photons are real , only one form factor enters the decay amplitude .",
    "however , other non - perturbative calculation is needed for the value of the form factor .",
    "we use the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) results for it @xcite .",
    "thus at nlo , @xmath7 and @xmath0 are characterized by the weak form factor @xmath22 and decay constant , plugged by the common perturbative and kinematical factors . with",
    "@xmath23 at hand , near future measurements of @xmath0 will check this structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "general setup and leading contribution to @xmath0 are given in the next section .",
    "section iii is devoted to the nlo corrections .",
    "the resulting branching ratios and related discussions appear in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .",

    ", only the terms proportional to @xmath126 survive . and",

    "@xmath43 amounts to @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "similar effects are expected in @xmath2 .",

    "for example , relevant wilson coefficients are known up to the three - loop level .",
    "the idea of the qcd factorization reduces model or process dependences . and",
    "various versions of effective theories of qcd such as hqet or scet have simplified the analysis dramatically .    in this paper ,",
    "radiative @xmath6 decays to the axial kaons are examined at nlo of @xmath9 .",
