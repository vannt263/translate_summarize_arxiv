    "what is the nature of the dark energy ( for simplicity , let us use the term `` dark energy '' to generically signify either a form of dark energy or a cosmological constant , i.e. the parameter @xmath1 ) that has been detected empirically to very high significance in observations of the universe with several different telescopes and different types of surveys ?",
    "this is one of the two key questions of this conference .",
    "however , the `` detection '' of dark energy would be meaningless without the underlying general - relativistic models of the universe .",
    "these models are the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker models .    what did de  sitter @xcite ,",
    "friedmann @xcite , lematre @xcite and robertson @xcite state were the two properties of the constant curvature 3-manifold of spatial sections of the universe that would need to be determined by observations ?",
    "they referred to both curvature and topology .",
    "it is through the link between curvature and the various density parameters ( e.g. the total density @xmath2 ) that we infer from observations that dark energy must ( according to the exact - flrw model ) exist .",
    "what is the role of topology ?",
    "we now know that theoretically , there are many different possibilities for the 3-manifold of the comoving spatial section of the universe for any of the three curvatures @xcite ( for a shorter introduction , see @xcite ) . for many years",
    ", it was thought that topology has no effect on the friedmann equation of an flrw model , since the einstein equations are , by definition , local , while topology ( used in this context to mean the @xmath3 homotopy group of a 3-manifold ) is a global property of a 3-manifold .",
    "indeed , for a perfectly homogeneous flrw model , this argument appears to be correct .    however , this parallel session is about the fact that the universe is not perfectly homogeneous .",
    "the planet earth , the solar system , the galaxy , clusters of galaxies and the cosmic web of large - scale structure exist and constitute violations of perfect homogeneity .",
    "many of the contributions in this session constitute work that may lead to ( or already has led to ) claims that the present `` dark energy '' is an approximation error rather than a physical phenomenon .",
    "that is , the einstein equations should in principle be solved by an inhomgeneous solution rather than by an homogeneous solution with perturbations added afterwards .",
    "is there a topological feedback effect on the friedmann equation in an almost - flrw universe , i.e. in one that is close to homogeneous but contains perturbations ?",
    "an elementary , weak - limit calculation for a flat universe with one simply - connected direction shows that in the presence of a density perturbation , a gravitational feedback effect does exist @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is algebraically similar to dark energy . in more general 3-manifolds",
    ", several further interesting characteristics are found @xcite .",
    "first consider a flat spatial section with one simply - connected direction , i.e. with spatial section @xmath5 , informally known as the three - dimensional 1-torus @xmath4 ( sect .",
    "3.1 , * ? ? ?",
    "3-spatial section , showing three copies of the fundamental domain of length @xmath6 .",
    "the model is homogeneous except for one massive particle ( perturbation ) as indicated .",
    "a massless test particle is located at distance @xmath7 from the massive particle along the short fundamental direction of the 3-manifold .",
    "[ f - t1],scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure  [ f - t1 ] shows this schematically .",
    "place a particle of mass @xmath8 , e.g. a high - mass cluster of galaxies , in an homogeneous background in a @xmath4 universe of comoving side - length @xmath6 and consider a nearby test particle at `` physical '' distance @xmath7 .",
    "assume that the particle horizon is large enough that gravitational signals from not only the nearby , `` original '' instance of the massive object , but also from the two nearest distant topological images of the object , have been received .",
    "approximating this in the weak limit , it is clear that the acceleration induced by the image of the cluster at the right - hand side of the figure will be nearly equal to , but slightly stronger than , the acceleration induced by the image of the cluster at the left - hand side of the figure .",
    "hence , these two `` topological '' accelerations do not quite cancel .",
    "the pull to the right is slightly stronger than that to the left , giving a residual acceleration .",
    "the residual acceleration ( in addition to the acceleration from the copy of the cluster immediately adjacent to the test particle ) is @xmath9                      \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx &   \\frac{4gm}{l^2}\\;\\frac{x}{l }    \\label{e - firstimage - test - object}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to first order in @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant .",
    "_ thus , in the presence of a density perturbation , a gravitational feedback effect due to global topology can exist .",
    "_ spherically symmetric solutions to the einstein equations can not represent this effect , because the distribution of matter in the covering space is not perfectly spherically symmetric .",
    "the multiple topological images of a single , physical , massive object prevent any possibility of spherical symmetry .",
    "algebraically , the residual acceleration effect derived in eq .",
    "( [ e - firstimage - test - object ] ) is similar to that of dark energy : @xmath12 the test particle sees an effect that opposes its `` normal '' attraction to the nearby instance of the massive particle .",
    "the further the test particle is displaced from the ( nearby instance of the ) massive particle , the stronger the effect . a fully relativistic , and necessarily non - spherically - symmetric , derivation of this effect remains to be carried out , but as derived here in the weak limit , it is algebraically similar to the effect of dark energy : it is an acceleration effect .",
    "the effect is unlikely to explain the presently observed dark energy .",
    "as derived heuristically in sect",
    ".  4.1 of ref  @xcite , the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath13 , for pressure @xmath14 , density @xmath15 and space - time unit conversion constant @xmath16 , would be @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the comoving separation such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the scale factor . for a typical distance of an object inside a `` unit '' of large - scale structure , i.e. a typical distance from a massive cluster of @xmath21 , and a typical value of @xmath22 for the 3-manifold favoured from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data , either for the poincar",
    "dodecahedral space @xcite or the 3-torus @xmath23 @xcite , we have @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the effect is small at the present .",
    "on the other hand , its role may have been important during early epochs .",
    "for example , in inflationary scenarios , the pre - inflationary universe might have been highly inhomogeneous .",
    "the existence of an effect of topology on the dynamics of an almost - flrw model shows that top - down effects , from global to local , can in principle play a role in physical models of the universe .",
    "the simplest way to explain the near - absence of structure in the wmap sky maps on scales above @xmath25 ( comoving ) , i.e. the nearly zero auto - correlation function on these scales ( see in particular refs @xcite ) , is that the compactness scale of the universe is close to this scale @xcite .",
    "the missing fluctuations interpretation is a more conservative interpretation of the wmap cosmological signal than what is frequently called the `` low quadrupole '' problem or the `` axis of evil '' problem @xcite .",
    "the type of 3-manifold that statistically can be expected to best match the data is one that is well - proportioned , i.e. that has approximately equal fundamental lengths of its fundamental domain in different directions @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is the regular 3-torus and the poincar dodecahedral space , both of which are well - proportioned , that are at present the favoured models , although some authors find that an infinite , flat model is preferred @xcite . among the spherical spaces , there also exist two other well - proportioned spaces , the octahedral space @xmath26 and the truncated - cube space @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "what is the nature of the residual gravitational acceleration effect , as derived above , in these spaces ?      in a regular @xmath23 perturbed - flrw model , i.e. containing a massive particle as before , consider fig .",
    "[ f - t1 ] .",
    "in addition to the adjacent topological images to the `` left '' and `` right '' , consider images of the massive particle that are `` below , above , in front of , and behind '' , relative to the 2-plane of the page .",
    "all four of these images are in the 2-plane that exactly bisects the `` left - hand '' and `` right - hand '' images .",
    "hence , the additional gravitational effect of these four images , in the weak limit , is to pull the test particle back towards the left , i.e. it opposes the effect given in eq .",
    "( [ e - firstimage - test - object ] ) . by",
    "how much is the effect weakened ? also , more generally , we need to consider a test particle offset from the massive particle in an arbitrary direction , rather than along one of the fundamental axes . in sect .",

    "3.1 of ref  @xcite , this more general calculation is given to first order for slightly irregular @xmath23 models and to third order for regular @xmath23 models , respectively , using taylor expansions in the displacement from the massive particle .",
    "for the regular @xmath23 model , the opposition between the four `` extra '' images and the initial images considered in the @xmath4 case leads to the cancellation of the first - order term in the residual acceleration .",

    "( 12 ) , @xcite}.    in this sense , we can say that a regular @xmath23 model is not only well - proportioned , but it is also well - balanced : the first - order terms balance each other perfectly , i.e. they cancel , leaving the third - order terms to dominate the expression .",
    "this relies on perfect regularity .    as shown in sect .",
    "3.2 of @xcite , if the three side - lengths are unequal , then the linear terms fail to cancel , so that the effect is again a linear effect , similar to the @xmath4 case .",
    "the effect is strongest in the shortest direction .",
    "it appears that this effect is a stabilising effect .",
    "given the heuristic argument in @xcite , an irregular @xmath23 model will have slightly anisotropic scale factors in the different directions in the sense that opposes the irregularity .",
    "shorter side - lengths will expand a little faster and longer side - lengths a little slower . before this result was found , perfectly regular @xmath23 models were the preferred @xmath23 model discussed in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) , but without any physical motivation .",
    "the residual gravity effect suggests a physical motivation for a regular @xmath23 model : it appears to be an equilibrium point ( a stable attractor ) in the phase space @xmath32 at which the residual gravity effect drops from a linear expression ( in terms of the dimensionless displacement ) to a third - order expression . here",
    ", @xmath33 are the three comoving side - lengths and @xmath34 are their respective derivatives with respect to proper time ( cosmological time ) .",
    "what happens in the spherical well - proportioned spaces ? calculating the residual acceleration effect for the spherical well - proportioned spherical spaces , i.e. the octahedral space @xmath26 , the truncated - cube space @xmath27 and the poincar dodecahedral space @xmath0 , is most easily done by embedding the covering space @xmath35 in euclidean 4-space @xmath36 . as explained in sect .",
