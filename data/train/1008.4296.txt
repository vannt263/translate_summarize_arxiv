    "in this paper , a _ principal shift - invariant space _ on the real line is a shift - invariant space @xmath8 generated by a function @xmath9 , @xmath10 such that @xmath11 is a riesz basis for @xmath8 , i.e. , there exist positive constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath14 the function @xmath2 is called the _ generator _ of the principal shift - invariant space @xmath8 , and it is called the _ orthonormal generator _ if @xmath11 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath8 , i.e. , holds for @xmath15 .",
    "principal shift - invariant spaces have been widely used in approximation theory , numerical analysis , sampling theory and wavelet theory ( see e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the classical models of principal shift - invariant spaces on the real line are the paley - wiener space @xmath16 also known as the space of bandlimited functions ( the set of all square - integrable functions bandlimited to @xmath17 $ ] ) and the spline space @xmath18 ( the set of all @xmath19-differentiable square - integrable functions whose restriction on any integer interval @xmath20 $ ] coincides with a polynomial of degree at most @xmath21 ) .",
    "more precisely , the paley - wiener space @xmath16 is the shift - invariant space generated by the sinc function @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 and the spline space @xmath24 is generated by the @xmath13-spline @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the characteristic function on @xmath28 and @xmath29 , are defined iteratively by @xmath30 .",
    "now we consider principal shift - invariant spaces that are invariant under additional set of translates other than @xmath31 .",
    "the shift - invariant spaces with additional invariance have been used in the study of wavelet analysis and sampling theory @xcite , and have been completely characterized in @xcite for @xmath32 and in @xcite for @xmath33 for a subspace @xmath34 of @xmath35 , let @xmath36 for any closed subspace @xmath34 of @xmath37 , one may verify that @xmath38 is a closed additive subgroup of @xmath39 , and hence @xmath38 is either @xmath40 , or @xmath39 , or @xmath41 for some @xmath42 .",
    "it can be shown that @xcite for a principal shift - invariant space @xmath8 on the real line @xmath43 we say that a shift - invariant space @xmath34 on the real line has additional invariance if @xmath44 .",
    "it is well - known that the paley - wiener space @xmath16 are invariant under all translations .",
    "thus , @xmath45 a closed subspace @xmath34 of @xmath37 with @xmath46 is usually known as a _ translation - invariant space_. the fact that the space of bandlimited functions @xmath16 is translation - invariant ( @xmath47 ) makes it useful for modeling signals and images . however , it is known that any function @xmath2 that generates a riesz basis for @xmath16 has slow spatial - decay in the sense that @xmath48 , e.g. , @xmath49 this slow spatial - decay property for the generator of principal shift - invariant spaces @xmath8 that are also translation - invariant is not unique to the space of bandlimited functions @xmath50 in fact , in this paper , we first show that the generator @xmath2 of any translation - invariant principal shift - invariant space @xmath8 on the real line is not integrable .",
    "[ bandlimited.tm ] let @xmath51 and @xmath11 be a riesz basis for its generating space @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath8 is translation - invariant then @xmath52 .",
    "the slow spatial - decay of the generators of shift - invariant spaces that are also translation - invariant is a disadvantage for the numerical implementation of some analysis and processing algorithms .    on the other hand , riesz bases for the spline spaces @xmath26",
    "can be generated by the compactly supported b - spline functions @xmath53 this is one of the reasons that spline spaces are often used in signal and image processing algorithms as well as in numerical analysis .",
    "moreover , the b - spline functions @xmath25 are also well localized in frequency domain , since @xmath54 . however , the spaces @xmath26 have no invariance other than by integer shifts . in fact",
    ", it can be shown that any principle shift - invariant space @xmath8 generated by a compactly supported function @xmath2 can not have any invariance other than by integer shifts @xcite .",
    "one way to circumvent some of the problems is to seek principle shift - invariant spaces @xmath8 that are close to being translation invariant , with a generator @xmath2 which is well localized in both space and frequency domains , i.e. , @xmath2 and @xmath55 are well localized .",
    "specifically , we ask whether we can find a shift - invariant space @xmath56 such that @xmath56 is also @xmath1 invariant for some @xmath57 , and such that @xmath2 and @xmath58 are well localized .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to construct functions @xmath2 that are well - localized in time and frequency domains , that generate shift - invariant spaces @xmath8 that are also @xmath1 invariant . however , there are uncertainty and balian - low type obstructions , as will be described below .",
    "specifically , the classical uncertainty principle tells us that there is a lower limit on the simultaneous time - frequency localization of functions as shown by    for any function @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "if we impose more conditions , the time - frequency localization deteriorates even further ( see e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) . for example , if the gabor system @xmath63 of a function @xmath64 is a riesz basis for @xmath65 , we will have the following balian - low theorem :    let @xmath66 . if @xmath67 is a riesz basis for @xmath65 , then @xmath68    the balian - low theorem implies that if function @xmath64 generates a gabor riesz basis , then it is not possible for the functions @xmath64 and @xmath69 to be simultaneously well - localized .",
    "in particular @xmath70 can not hold simultaneously with @xmath71 .      for the case of a shift - invariant space @xmath8 which is also @xmath1 invariant for some @xmath72 , we obtain the following surprising result :    [ gup ] if @xmath51 has the property that @xmath11 is a riesz basis for its generating space @xmath8 , and that @xmath8 is @xmath1-invariant for some @xmath0 , then for any @xmath4 , we have @xmath73    @xmath74 +    1 .   theorem [ gup ]",
    "is a balian - low type result .",
    "if we choose @xmath75 in of theorem [ gup ] , we get @xmath76 it should be noted that in the balian - low theorem @xmath77 can be finite , while in the case of theorem [ gup ] @xmath78 is always infinite . for the case",
    "@xmath79 , the theorem above should be comparable to the @xmath80 version of the balian - low theorem ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   if we do not require other invariances besides integer shifts , then we can find @xmath8 such that @xmath81 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath34 and such that @xmath2 decays exponentially in both time and frequency .",
    "in particular for such a @xmath2 it is obvious that @xmath82 where @xmath83 are any positive real numbers .",
    "there is also a decay restriction in the fourier domain .",
    "specifically , the fourier transform of an integrable generator @xmath2 of a principal shift - invariant space which is @xmath1-invariant for some integer @xmath84 can not decay faster than @xmath85 for any @xmath86    [ fgup ] let @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 have the property that @xmath11 is a riesz basis for its generating space @xmath8 , and that @xmath8 is @xmath1-invariant , then for any @xmath4 , @xmath89    we conclude from theorem [ fgup ] that there is an obstruction to pointwise frequency ( non)-localization property .",
    "the conclusion of theorem [ fgup ] remains valid if we weaken the condition that @xmath88 to @xmath90 and @xmath58 is continuous .",
    "now , we show the optimality of the results of theorems [ gup ] and [ fgup ] .",
    "the following result shows that in theorem [ fgup ] is sharp and that for any @xmath57 there exists a generator @xmath88 ( that depends on @xmath21 ) for @xmath8 such that @xmath58 decays like @xmath91 .",
    "this is done by constructing time - frequency localized generators @xmath2 that achieve the desired properties :    [ pointwisefreqloc ] for each integer @xmath84 , there exists a function @xmath88 ( and hence @xmath58 is continuous ) which depends on @xmath21 , such that @xmath92 is an orthonormal basis for its generating space @xmath8 , @xmath8 is @xmath1-invariant , and    @xmath93    @xmath94    @xmath95    1 .   note that by giving up the translation invariance and only allowing @xmath96 invariance as in theorem [ pointwisefreqloc ] , we are able to have an @xmath97 generator , while this is not possible for translation invariance as shown in theorem [ bandlimited.tm ] .",
    "note that theorem [ pointwisefreqloc ] shows the optimality of both theorems [ gup ] and [ fgup ] simultaneously .",
    "we now turn our attention to the integral measure of time - frequency localization , and show that in theorem [ gup ] is nearly optimal .",
    "[ time.tm ] for any @xmath57 , @xmath4 , @xmath98 @xmath99 , @xmath100 with @xmath101 there exists @xmath90 ( that depends on @xmath102 ) such that @xmath92 is an orthonormal basis for its generating space @xmath8 , @xmath8 is @xmath1-invariant and @xmath2 satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",

    "@xmath104 3 .",
    "@xmath105    @xmath106    * note that the orthonormal generator @xmath107 for the paley - wiener space @xmath16 satisfies the first and third localization properties in theorem [ time.tm ] .",
    "this shows that theorem [ gup ] is optimal .",
    "however , the @xmath108 function does not satisfies the second time localization inequality .",
    "in fact no function @xmath2 generating a shift - invariant space @xmath8 that is also translation invariant can satisfy the second inequality of theorem [ time.tm ] , as is shown in theorem [ bandlimited.tm ] .",
    "thus by relaxing translation invariance to @xmath1 invariance we are able to get better time localization in the sense of the second localization inequality above . for this however , we needed to trade off some frequency localization by allowing infinite support in frequency .",
    "* we do not know what happens for the case @xmath109 * using lemmas [ timelem ] , [ timelemp ] and [ freqlem ] , theorem [ time.tm ] can be shown to be valid for other norms and other weights .",
    "* @xmath11 is a riesz basis for its generating space @xmath8 if and only if @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are positive constants , and * @xmath11 is an orthonormal basis for its generating space @xmath8 if and only if @xmath113          suppose on the contrary that there exists a principal shift - invariant space @xmath8 on the real line such that @xmath8 is translation - invariant and the generator @xmath2 is integrable .",
    "let @xmath116 since @xmath117 by assumption , @xmath58 is continuous , and hence @xmath118 is an open set . from proposition [ sis.prop ]",
    "it follows that the lebesgue measure of the set @xmath119 is zero for all @xmath120 .",
    "this together with the fact that @xmath118 is an open set gives that @xmath121 recall that @xmath122 is connected and that any connected set is not a union of nonempty disjoint open sets .",
    "thus @xmath123 is not an open covering of the real line , i.e. , @xmath124 , which in turn implies the existence of a real number @xmath125 with the property that @xmath126 as @xmath58 is uniformly continuous by the assumption that @xmath117 , for any @xmath4 there exists @xmath99 such that @xmath127 there exists an integer @xmath128 such that @xmath129 combining , and yields @xmath130 since @xmath4 can be chosen to be arbitrarily small , the last inequality contradicts the riesz basis property that there exists @xmath131 such that @xmath132 for almost all @xmath114 .",
    "[ sis.prop2 ] ( @xcite )  let @xmath84 be an integer , and @xmath51 with the property that @xmath11 is a riesz basis for its generating space @xmath8",
    ". then @xmath8 is @xmath1-invariant if and only if for almost all @xmath133 , one and only one of the following vectors @xmath134 is nonzero .",

    ". then we obtain that @xmath152 and @xmath153 where @xmath154 is used to obtain the second inequality , where the third inequality is obtained by letting @xmath155 and using hlder inequality .",
    "also we have that @xmath156 where the first equality follows from .",
    "combining , and with proposition [ riesz.prop ] gives @xmath157 which is a contradiction .",
    "note that @xmath158 implies that @xmath58 is uniformly continuous .",
    "now , suppose on the contrary that @xmath159 for some positive constants @xmath160 and @xmath4 .",
