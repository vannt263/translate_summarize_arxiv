    "one of the most important features of the standard model of the electroweak interactions @xcite is the non - abelian gauge nature of the vector bosons . in the present paper ,",
    "we discuss this point , namely the structure of the self couplings of the electroweak vector bosons . in order to do it ,",
    "we analyze @xmath0 production in deep inelastic ( anti)neutrino - nucleon scattering by using the parton model @xcite , in the context of an electroweak model with non - standard vector boson self interactions .",
    "such a model was proposed by m. kuroda _ et al . _",
    "( kmss model ) @xcite . in this model the trilinear vector boson coupling constants depend on only one free parameter , @xmath5 , the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the @xmath0 @xcite . the diagrams which contribute to the @xmath0 boson production cross section , at the quark level in the lowest order in @xmath8 , contain only three vector boson self interactions ,",
    "hence the boson production rates depend only on @xmath5 . at the present time the best limits on @xmath5 are @xmath9 from a recent analysis of the l3 collaboration at lep @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have discussed the heavy boson production via the deep inelastic @xmath10 in the context of the standard model .",
    "we pointed out there that the process @xmath11",
    "( @xmath2 : @xmath3 proton , @xmath4 neutron ) is the only one which gets contribution from photon - exchange diagrams and that its total cross section reaches significant values for ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) neutrinos@xcite colliding on a target nucleon .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves our study in this paper to the mentioned process .- scattering can be obtained from those of @xmath10-scattering by the replacement @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14-type quarks @xmath15 @xmath16-type quarks ]    in this work , we calculate in the context of the standard model separately the contribution to the process @xmath11 from the two different mechanisms which contribute at the lowest order in @xmath8 , keeping only photon exchange diagrams : production at the leptonic vertex and through the boson self interaction .",
    "we show explicitly the compensation via destructive interference inherent to the standard model as a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "we find that this compensation reaches up to four orders of magnitude , for ultrahigh - energy neutrinos with energy @xmath17 colliding on a target nucleon .",
    "hence , one could expect that even small deviations from the coupling structure of the standard model , like an anomalous dipole magnetic moment different from 1 , would lead to observable effects in the predictions for charged boson production in @xmath10 collisions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we take the formulae given in [ 6 ] for heavy boson production in @xmath10-scattering and extended them for the case of @xmath18 boson production via the process @xmath11 , in the frame of an electroweak model , in which the trilinear vector boson coupling constants may deviate through an anomalous magnetic dipole moment term from those given by the standard model . in section iii , we describe briefly the non - standard electroweak model , which we will take for our study . in section iv",
    ", we present and discuss our results for the total cross section of deep inelastic process @xmath11 , which is the only one that gets contribution from @xmath19-exchange diagrams .",
    "finally , in section v , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we have discussed in [ 6 ] the heavy boson production via the deep inelastic @xmath10 collisions in the context of the standard model .",
    "we showed there that the process @xmath21 is the only one which gets contribution from photon - exchange diagrams and that its total cross section reaches significant values for uhe neutrinos colliding on a target nucleon .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves our study in this paper to the mentioned reaction . in fig .",
    "1 are depicted the diagrams which contribute at the lowest order in @xmath8 at the quark parton level to the cross section of process ( 1 ) .",
    "we have presented in detail the kinematics of heavy boson production in deep inelastic @xmath22 scattering in [ 6 ] and we pointed out there how to take care for the different ways in which the bosons are arranged in the non - abelian couplings diagrams .",
    "now we will extend the formulae given there for the process ( 1 ) in the case in which the @xmath18 boson may have an anomalous magnetic moment @xmath23 different from that predicted by the standard model .",
    "we will assume for the trilinear coupling constants of the vector bosons the following general form : @xmath24 the standard model self interactions are obtained by taking @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 being the electroweak mixing angle ) .    in order to calculate @xmath18 boson production through process ( 1 ) with the non - standard non - abelian couplings given in ( 2 )",
