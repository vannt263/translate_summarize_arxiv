    "<S> in contrast to twist maps,@xcite the periodicity of the elements of the continued fraction expansion has not been linked to the periodicity of the critical residue sequence and therefore our new result would not have been predicted . </S>",

    "<S> one important characteristic of nontwist maps is the existence of multiple orbit chains ( _ up _ and _ down _ orbits ) of the same winding number , which can undergo bifurcations when the map parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 are changed . when two invariant tori collide , the winding number profile shows a local extremum and the orbit at collision is referred to as the _ shearless _ torus . for a given winding number these collisions occur along bifurcation curves @xmath40 in parameter space.@xcite    in order to study a shearless invariant torus , </S>",

    "<S> + the study of the breakup of tori with non - noble winding numbers is difficult because , due to numerical limitations , only periodic orbits for a small number of elements of the continued fraction expansion can be found . </S>",
    "<S> therefore one can not numerically distinguish between a torus that has 2 s as all entries in the continued fraction expansion and one that has 2 s until one reaches the numerical limit , and then 1 s for the tail ( i.e. , a noble number ) .    to make a definite prediction for the @xmath0 torus we study the breakup of a series of sixteen invariant tori @xmath46 , starting with @xmath47 $ ] up to @xmath48 $ ] with fifteen 2 s in the continued fraction expansion .    </S>",
