    "high - energy neutrinos can be produced in the direct vicinity of charged cosmic ray sources by the interaction of the high - energy cosmic rays with matter or photon fields . in those processes ,",
    "charged pions are produced and result in a flux of high - energy neutrinos .",
    "the latter are unique messengers with which to observe the universe , as they have no charge and interact weakly , traveling directly from their point of creation essentially without absorption , distinguishing them from cosmic rays and high energy photons .",
    "neutrinos are key in understanding the mechanisms of cosmic ray acceleration , and their detection from an astrophysical point source would be a clear indication of hadronic acceleration in that source .",
    "time - integrated analyses suffer from a high irreducible background of atmospheric neutrinos and atmospheric muons , making them less sensitive for the detection of flares .",
    "time - dependent analyses aim to reduce this background by searching over smaller time scales around the flares .",
    "the searches discussed in this paper are about a factor of four to five more powerful than time - integrated searches for flares of @xmath1  second .",
    "four searches for time - dependent neutrino emissions from various categories of flaring sources are presented in this paper using data from the incomplete 22 and 40-string configurations of icecube .",
    "we call `` triggered '' searches those using multi - wavelength ( mwl ) information from photon experiments as a method of selecting flaring periods . based on this information , we select catalogues of interesting candidate neutrino - emitting flares .",
    "we focus on flares of larger duration than grbs that are covered by other icecube searches @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "sources we consider are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and one period of activity from the newly discovered soft gamma repeater , sgr 0501 + 4516 .",
    "the underlying assumption of triggered searches is that the neutrino emission follows the time - dependent emission of the photons , as a consequence of an excited state of the source when the jet can accelerate particles to higher energies than in the quiescent state .",
    "this hypothesis is assumed in the likelihood method as a prior . in order to make the search for flares as general as possible , an `` untriggered '' scan for clusters of events in time and direction without prior timing information",
    "is also performed .",
    "untriggered searches are capable of detecting flares of duration similar to gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) to flares lasting many days , as seen in agns . while dedicated grb searches are more sensitive , the untriggered all - sky search is capable of detecting quenched grbs which may have been undetected by photon telescopes and",
    "hence not included in the dedicated searches .",
    "all - sky searches are affected by large trial factors , hence a catalogue of promising sources which are variable in mwl observations is selected for an additional untriggered search .    the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "the properties of the flaring sources , agns , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and sgrs are considered . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "the data samples of 40 strings and 22 strings of icecube are described . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "the time - dependent likelihood method is illustrated in general and compared with the time - integrated method .",
    "the four searches for flares are :    * an untriggered all - sky scan for short - duration neutrino emission from point - like sources ( section [ sec6 ] ) ; * an untriggered search for flares from a predefined catalogue of 40 sources identified as variable in gev photons ( section [ sec5 ] ) ; * a triggered search for continuously monitored sources using mwl information .",
    "data from the fermi - lat and also from swift ( section [ sec7 ] ) are used ; * a triggered search using sporadic information on flares collected by various x - ray experiments and imaging cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) with typical energy thresholds around 300 gev ( section [ sec8 ] ) .",
    "these experiments have a reduced duty cycle compared to fermi and tend to monitor sources mainly during their flaring states .    in sections 5 to 8",
    "each search method and its expected discovery potential are presented , and results are provided . in all searches",
    "the background is estimated directly from scrambled data , since the signal contribution is expected to be small . to avoid any bias toward discovery ,",
    "each search has been performed in a blind fashion by defining cuts and search methods before looking at the final event sample .",
    "the final significance , which accounts for the different trials , is calculated by scrambling data in time . for each search",
    "the resulting probabilities ( @xmath2-values ) that the data could be due to background fluctuation are provided ( see also section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "trial factors between searches are not included in the @xmath2-values , as these trial factors are negligible compared to the 5@xmath3 significance required by icecube for a claim of discovery .",
    "galactic and extra - galactic sources exhibit time - dependent variability ranging from short bursts with durations between seconds and minutes ( e.g. grbs or giant flares from sgrs ) to long periods of high activity lasting hours to weeks ( e.g. agn flares ) .",
    "one of the main targets of the searches presented in this paper is variable emission from agns .",
    "flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacs , commonly unified in the agn class of blazars , exhibit relativistic jets pointing towards the earth and some of the most violent variable high energy phenomena .",
    "their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) extend orders of magnitudes across the electromagnetic spectrum and are characterized by structures of low and high energy non - thermal peaks .",
    "after 11 months of operation , the fermi - lat collaboration published their first agn catalogue @xcite containing 709 gev - sources associated with agns , many of which are in the previously published bright source list catalogue @xcite .",
    "a previous stacking search for neutrinos from agns used amanda data @xcite .",
    "the low energy component in the radio to soft x - rays is due to synchrotron radiation of electrons gyrating in a magnetic field .",
    "the high energy component ( x - ray to @xmath4-ray ) is explained in leptonic models by synchrotron emissions of electrons in the jet and subsequent up - scattering of photons ( inverse compton ) by the electron population responsible for the synchrotron emission .",
    "hadronic models are used to explain the high energy component with relativistic protons , with energies above the threshold for p-@xmath4 or p - p pion production , which will decay to @xmath4-rays and also neutrinos .",
    "proton synchrotron emission can also contribute to the high - energy component if they are accelerated to very high energies ( for a review on models see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the emission from blazars is known to be variable at all wavelengths .",
    "simultaneous mwl observations are crucial for understanding the cause of this variability @xcite .",
    "the intensity of these objects can vary by more than an order of magnitude between different observing epochs .",
    "the typical time scales of agn flares vary from hours to days , though high - energy variability has been observed on much shorter time scales , in some cases even down to just a few minutes @xcite .",
    "while leptonic models enjoy relatively good success reproducing the observed emission , other arguments favor a hadronic component .",
    "perhaps the most compelling evidence are observations of `` orphan '' flares , defined as tev photon emission without accompanying x - rays , such as the 1es 1959 + 650 flare in 2002 @xcite .",
    "an a posteriori observation with amanda - ii of two events @xcite , one exactly during the flare and another 31 days later , triggered some theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "two recent flares included in the mwl triggered searches ( see sections [ sec7 ] and [ sec8 ] also @xcite ) are suspected to be orphan flares , but x - ray observations were not simultaneous with gamma - ray observations and there is a possibility of having missed the x - ray flare .",
    "grbs , believed to be produced by the most powerful phenomena in the universe @xcite , are interesting as time - dependent candidate neutrino sources @xcite .",
    "icecube conducts dedicated searches which are triggered by satellite information for these objects ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the untriggered all - sky search presented in this paper is also sensitive to this source class if two or more neutrinos can be detected from the same grb .",
    "while the dedicated searches are in general much more sensitive ( because they use the known time and direction of grbs observed in gamma- or x - rays ) , the untriggered search has the potential to detect a burst which was not observed in photons ( due to e.g. absorption or lack of monitoring ) .",
    "another possibility for powerful emission is given by sgr s , x - ray pulsars that show variability at different timescales and a persistent x - ray emission with luminosity @xmath5  erg / s with short bursts of x- and @xmath4-rays with @xmath6  erg / s lasting @xmath7 seconds ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "these x - ray pulsars , together with anomalous x - ray pulsars , are considered to be the best candidates for magnetars , isolated neutron stars powered by huge magnetic fields ( @xmath8 ) . at times",
    "these sources emit giant flares with initial spikes of hard non - thermal radiation up to luminosities of @xmath9  erg / s lasting some seconds .",
    "the enormous photon fluxes from these flares saturate most detectors .",
    "the flares may also accelerate baryons and produce neutrinos @xcite .",
    "limits for photons in the 10 tev-100 pev energy range using amanda - ii data were published from the powerful giant flare observed in dec .",
    "2004 from sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite . in the catalogue ( table [ ic40flare ] )",
    "used in one of the triggered flare searches ( section [ sec8 ] ) , we consider six days from a period of intense flaring from sgr 0501 + 4516 is included , which was discovered by swift beginning aug .",
    "22 , 2008 and also observed by rxte / asm , konus - wind and the fermi gbm @xcite .",
    "even if the period of activity of sgr 0501 + 4516 is not as intense as a giant flare and the observed power law component was quite soft @xcite , this was a long - lasting period of flares that lead to the object s discovery as an sgr .",
    "periods of activity from known sgrs 1e 1514 - 57 and sgr 1806 - 20 were omitted , since the large background of atmospheric muons severely limits icecube sensitivity to southern hemisphere objects .",
    "the icecube neutrino observatory is composed of a deep array of 86 strings holding 5,160 digital optical modules ( doms ) , which are deployed between 1.45 and 2.45 km below the glacial surface at the geographic south pole @xcite .",
    "icecube strings are horizontally separated by about 125 m with doms positioned vertically 17 m apart along each string .",
    "each dom consists of a hamamatsu photomultiplier with 25 cm diameter @xcite , electronics for waveform digitization @xcite , and a spherical , pressure - resistant glass housing .",
    "icecube construction started with a first string installed in the 2005 - 6 season @xcite and has recently been completed in the austral summer of 2010 - 11 .",
    "the configurations of icecube that have been used for the present analyses ( 22-string and 40-string ) are shown in figure  [ ic2240_geometry ] .",
    "the icecube neutrino observatory includes a dense subarray , deepcore , designed to enhance the physics performance of icecube below 1 tev @xcite and a surface array , icetop , for extensive air shower measurements on the composition and spectrum of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "icecube uses a simple multiplicity trigger , which requires that at least eight doms are triggered within 5 @xmath0s . for a dom to trigger , it is both required that the dom pmt voltage crosses the discriminator threshold ( 0.25 of a typical photoelectron ) , and this `` hit '' to be in coincidence with at least one other hit in the nearest or next - to - nearest neighboring doms on a string within @xmath10s .",
    "this greatly reduces hits due to uncorrelated pmt noise and radioactivity in the glass . once the simple multiplicity condition is satisfied , information from all triggered doms within a @xmath1110 @xmath0s window",
    "is read out and merged to create an event .",
    "this means that 20 @xmath0s is the effective limit on how close two events can be in time for the 40-string or 22-string data .",
    "improvements in event definition remove this constraint for data taken with the completed detector .",
    "standard icecube runs are eight hours long , runs in the 40 and 22-string configurations have a roughly two minute gap between the end of one run and the beginning of the next , improvements have eliminated this gap in the operation of the full detector .",
    "the rate of each run is monitored and checked for any deviation from an average that accounts for a seasonally adjusted average rate @xcite .",
    "identification of neutrino - induced muon events in icecube was demonstrated using atmospheric neutrinos as a calibration tool @xcite .",
    "the measurement of atmospheric neutrinos by the 40-string configuration has been presented in @xcite .",
    "this sample of upgoing events dominated by atmospheric neutrinos is used to look for astrophysical signals from point sources using directional and energy information . in the 40-string sample ,",
    "the icecube field of view has been extended compared to the upgoing only sample of 22-strings @xcite to also include downgoing events from the southern hemisphere .",
    "this technique was used for the first time to include events to @xmath12 declination with the 22-string configuration @xcite .",
    "the background sample in the downgoing region consists of very high energy muons .",
    "atmospheric muons are roughly five orders of magnitude more numerous than neutrino - induced muons at the depth of icecube",
    ". however , their number can be reduced by selecting high energy events so that the astrophysical signal can potentially emerge , if the signal spectrum is harder than that of the atmospheric background .",
    "this results in a different sensitivity for the northern hemisphere , where tev - pev neutrino astronomy is possible due to absorption of atmospheric muons in the earth , with respect to the southern hemisphere , where only pev - eev neutrino searches are performed in the current analysis .",
    "the selection of the data from the icecube 40-string configuration used in this search is discussed in the paper on the time - integrated searches , @xcite .",
    "we refer to this paper for all details on the selection of the muon events in the filtered stream ( l1 ) that is sent over satellite from the south pole and on the final cuts to obtain the data sample used in this analysis .",
    "the cuts were optimized using an @xmath13 spectrum signal , as expected of neutrinos directly accelerated in astrophysical sources via stochastic shock acceleration . while this idea was first presented by @xcite , and further developed by e.g. @xcite .",
    "the resulting particle spectra follow a power - law close to @xmath13 .",
    "detailed calculations show , however , that depending on the shock conditions , the spectra can also be somewhat flatter or steeper , see e.g. @xcite . here",
    ", we use an @xmath13 spectrum as a first order estimate .",
    "it also includes a detailed discussion on the analysis method .",
    "the final sample consists of 36,900 atmospheric neutrino and muon events from the whole sky ( @xmath14 to + 85@xmath15 in declination ) detected by icecube in the 40-string configuration in 375.5 days of good data taking , which corresponds to 92% uptime during the nominal operation period between april 5 , 2008 and may 20 , 2009 or modified julian date ( mjd ) 5456154971 . in this sample ,",
    "14,121 events are up - going , while 22,779 events are down - going .",
    "deadtime for this analysis is mainly due to test and calibration runs during and after the construction season . for time - dependent analyses in general ,",
    "parts of the detector may be excluded for short periods from the acquisition , but the remaining part can be useful in case an astrophysical event occurs ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the triggered search for flares ( section [ sec8 ] )",
    "we also consider events observed during data taking with 22 strings of icecube , with a livetime of 275.7 days , or 89% of the operation period from may 31 , 2007 to april 5 , 2008 ( mjd 54251 - 54561 ) .",
    "this sample is described in @xcite , and consists of 5114 candidate events from declinations -5@xmath15 to + 85@xmath15 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties have been evaluated and presented in sec .",
    "6 of @xcite for the 40-string data and have also been discussed in @xcite for the 22-string data .",
    "the main uncertainties on the limits to the fluence of an @xmath13 signal of muon neutrinos come from photon propagation , absolute dom efficiency , and uncertainties in the earth density profile and muon energy loss , accounting for a total of 16% . in this paper",
    "we focus on issues related to transient searches , such as the stability in time of the data sample and effects of the detector asymmetry for flares lasting less than one day .",
    "before cuts are applied to the data , the samples are dominated by downgoing atmospheric muons .",
    "this is the case in the upgoing signal region as well , since some atmospheric muons are misreconstructed as upgoing and must be rejected in the process of applying analysis cuts .",
    "the atmospheric muon rate exhibits a seasonal variation of roughly @xmath16 due to changes in density of the atmosphere at the south pole @xcite . when the atmosphere is warmer and less dense during the austral summer , the fraction of pions and kaons in air showers which decay before interacting is increased compared to the winter .",
    "the muon rate also varies several percent on timescales of several days as a result of weather phenomena in antarctica . for upgoing atmospheric neutrinos",
    "the seasonal variations are smaller , approximately 5% , since neutrinos are created over a wide range of earth s latitudes compared to the atmospheric muons created near the south pole . to ensure stable detector conditions , the event rates of runs were required to be within @xmath17 from a rolling average over @xmath18 days .",
    "this loose constraint allows for short - term weather variability .",
    "all events have initial reconstructions performed using track and cascade based hypotheses , some of which are selected for transmission over satellite to the northern hemisphere for additional processing and analysis .",
    "the muon filter focuses on the selection of upward - going track - like events .",
    "the temporal variation of the event rate for the 22-string and 40-string runs is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , where the seasonal modulation is clearly visible .",
    "the rate of the 40 string final event sample is shown in figure  [ figrates ] for upgoing and downgoing events and for the total sample .    due to the requirements for triggering and filtering , the cuts applied , earth absorption properties and detector geometry , the final sample of events is not uniform in the detector local coordinates zenith ( @xmath19 ) , and azimuth ( @xmath20 ) . for time - integrated point source searches , the azimuth dependence is usually neglected because it is smoothed in right ascension by the rotation of the earth over long integration times . however , in a time - dependent analysis the azimuth dependence becomes important for time scales shorter than 1 day .",
    "the local coordinate ( zenith and azimuth ) distribution of 40 string data is shown in figure  [ figlocalcoords ] ( left ) . in the northern sky",
    "there is the effect that events traveling along the longer axis ( see figure  [ ic2240_geometry ] ) of the detector have a longer lever arm , and are more likely to trigger the detector and be well - reconstructed .",
    "well reconstructed events typically have angular reconstruction errors of @xmath21 and energy reconstruction resolution of 0.3 in @xmath22 . in the southern sky",
    ", there is an online cut on the integrated charge seen in all doms for a given event .",
    "this gives a preference to events which pass near a line of strings , yielding a six - fold peak in rates corresponding to the main axes of the detector symmetry .",
    "the unbinned likelihood searches performed here are based on the method described in @xcite and extended to searches for time - dependent behavior in @xcite . in this likelihood ratio method ,",
    "a combination of signal and background populations is used to model the data . for a data set with @xmath23 total events ,",
    "the probability density of the @xmath24 event is given by :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the unknown number of signal events with signal fraction of @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the background probability density function ( pdf ) and @xmath29 is the signal pdf .",

    "the maximization provides the best - fit values of these parameters .",
    "the background pdf , @xmath28 , is given by :    @xmath32    and is computed using the distribution of data itself .",
    "the spatial term @xmath33 is the event density per unit solid angle as a function of the local coordinates , shown in figure  [ figlocalcoords ] ( left ) .",
    "the energy probability , @xmath34 , is determined from the reconstructed energy distribution of data as a function of the cosine of the zenith angle @xmath35 ( see figure  [ figlocalcoords ] on the right ) .",
    "this energy reconstruction , described in detail in @xcite , compares the measured to the expected density of photons along the muon track due to stochastic energy losses of pair production , bremsstrahlung and photonuclear interactions which dominate over ionization losses for muons above 1 tev .",
    "the reconstructed energy value represents an estimate of the muon energy in gev .",
    "the energy cut for the southern sky sample increases for smaller zenith angles , creating a strong zenith dependence of the energy in the southern sky as can be seen in figure  [ figlocalcoords ] ( right ) .",
    "the goal of the energy cut is to sample a constant number of events per unit solid angle in the southern sky .",
    "note that for the northern sky the energy dependence on zenith is small .",
    "the time probability @xmath36 of the background can be modeled including the expected seasonal modulations ( done in section [ sec5 ] ) , which are less than @xmath16 and depend on the zenith angle , or taken to be flat since these modulations are negligible compared to possible signal fluctuations ( all other searches ) .",
    "the signal pdf @xmath29 is given by :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 depends on the angular uncertainty of the event @xmath39 and the angular difference between the event coordinate @xmath40 and the source coordinate @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 , the energy dependent pdf which is a function of the reconstructed event energy @xmath43 , and of the spectral index @xmath44 ( a power - law spectrum with no cutoff such that @xmath45 ) is calculated from an energy distribution of simulated signal in a zenith band that contains the event .",

    "it depends on the particular signal hypothesis , which will be described in detail in each section . for each search",
    ", signal is injected with the same functional form in time as is being tested . due to the low number of signal events involved , cross tests using one emission profile for the injection and a different one for the search yield largely similar results .",
    "the searches were designed to improve discovery potential with a minimum of source assumptions .",

    "the best fit parameters @xmath49 and any fit time parameters @xmath50 ( which will be explained for each search ) are obtained by maximizing @xmath47 .",
    "several searches differ in the methods used to find the maximum value of @xmath47 , and may include weighting terms for values of a best fit parameter , which will be included in their description below .",
    "larger values of @xmath47 are less compatible with the null hypothesis , and indicate its rejection at a significance level corresponding to the fraction of the scrambled trials above the @xmath47 value found in the data .",
    "data scrambling is done by assigning a random time to each event from a period of active data taking and performing the proper coordinate transformation to get a new right ascension and declination .",
    "the fraction of trials above the @xmath47 value obtained from data is referred to as the _ @xmath2-value_.",
    "this leads to the definition of the discovery potential at a particular significance level : the average number of signal events required to achieve a @xmath2-value less than a specified threshold in 50% of trials .",
    "icecube uses a one - sided 5@xmath3 significance level as the threshold for discovery , corresponding to a @xmath2-value of 2.87@xmath51 .",
    "similarly , the sensitivity is defined as the average signal required to obtain a @xmath2-value less than that of the median of the test statistic distribution of scrambled ( background - only ) samples in 90% of trials .    aside from the @xmath2-values from searches , in the absence of a signal upper limits on the fluence are provided , defined as the integral in energy and time of the flux upper limit : @xmath52 ~~ , \\label{eq : fluence}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the upper limit on the normalization on an @xmath13 spectrum and @xmath54 and @xmath55 specify the declination dependent energy range containing 90% of the signal spectrum at final sample selection criteria obtained from simulations .",
    "@xmath56 is the duration of the emission .",
    "there is a correspondence between the fluence and the average number of events detected , shown as a function of the declination in figure  [ fig : em2fluence ] .",
    "the limits are calculated according to the classical ( frequentist ) construction of upper limits @xcite and the systematic error of 16% is neglected in all upper limits since the limits are dominated by statistical fluctuations for flares .",
    "limits in this paper have been produced assuming a flux of only muon neutrinos .",
    "the scenario of standard neutrino oscillations over astronomical distances @xcite assumes equal fluxes of all flavors of neutrinos at the earth from a source producing neutrinos via pion decay with a ratio of @xmath57 .",
    "when considering equal fluxes of muon and tau neutrinos at the earth , the resulting upper limits on the sum of both fluxes are about a factor of 1.7 times higher than if only muon neutrinos are considered rather than the expected factor of two due to oscillation if no tau neutrinos would be detectable . for an @xmath13 spectrum of the signal neutrino flux the contribution due to the detectable tau neutrino flux for sources at the horizon is 10% and up to 15% for sources in the northern hemisphere .",
    "this is due to the tau decay channel into muons with a branching ratio of 17.7% and in part to the tau leptons with energy greater than some pevs that may travel far enough to be reconstructed as tracks in icecube before decaying . in the upgoing region",
    "we have considered tau regeneration in the earth .",
    "the all - sky time - dependent search presented here complements the all - sky search applied to the icecube 40-string data in @xcite .",
    "while that search has the best sensitivity to steady sources , a source which has emitted neutrinos for only a limited period of time might not be detected .",
    "the time - dependent analysis here scans for a significant excess with respect to background over all time scales ( from sub - seconds to the full year ) at each direction of the sky . for flares shorter than @xmath58100 days , the discovery potential of the time - dependent search typically becomes better than the time - integrated one , and in principle a short burst can be discovered with only two events if they occur close enough together in time ( @xmath59 seconds for @xmath13 spectrum events ) .",
    "the advantage of such untriggered searches is their ability to cover all emission scenarios , including neutrino emission without any observed counterpart in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the method in @xcite is adapted for this search to a real detector with non - uniform acceptance and deadtime .",
    "the non - uniform acceptance can be seen in [ figlocalcoords ] , deadtime compensation is shown below in [ fig6.0 ] .",
    "the time - dependent probability density function from equation [ llh_signal_time1 ] for this search is a gaussian function :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the arrival time of the event , and",
    "fit parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the mean and sigma of the gaussian describing flaring behavior in time .",
    "the maximization of the test statistic returns the best - fit values of the gaussian mean ( the time at which the flare peaks ) and sigma ( corresponding to the duration of the flare ) .",
    "both the background and expected number of events are small , distinguishing a box - type function from a gaussian would require many more events than required for a 5@xmath3 discovery , and we find that using either of these flare hypotheses performs similarly ( see section  [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "it was found that the fitting method used in this section worked better with a continuous function , so a gaussian functional form was chosen .    because there are many more independent small time windows than large ones , the test statistic formula of equation [ eq : ts ]",
    "is modified to include a weighting term to correct for this effective trial factor and avoid undue preference for short flares using a bayesian approach @xcite .",
    "the test statistic formula that is maximized is then :    @xmath64~ ,    \\label{marginalize}\\ ] ]    where the first factor in the square brackets is the weighting term and the second is the likelihood ratio .",
    "t is the total livetime of data taking , @xmath65 are the best - fit values for the number of signal events , spectral index , width and mean of the gaussian flare , respectively . in order to prevent the weighting term from becoming less than 1 ,",
    "a constraint is placed on the flare width @xmath66 .",
    "this is done to prevent flares with zero amplitude ( @xmath67=0 ) from having a positive test statistic , which would happen if the flare width @xmath66 were allowed to be greater than @xmath68 .",
    "as described in @xcite , the numerical maximizer needs an initial candidate flare ( a `` first guess '' ) . in that paper",

    "so , for a stream consisting of time - ordered events numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ... , the initial test uses events ( 1,2 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ( 3,4 ) etc . , ( 1,2,3 ) , ( 2,3,4 ) , ( 3,4,5 ) etc . , ( 1,2,3,4 ) , ( 2,3,4,5 ) , ( 3,4,5,6 ) etc . , and ( 1,2,3,4,5 ) , ( 2,3,4,5,6 ) etc",

    "the candidate with the best test statistic ( from equation [ marginalize ] ) is used as the initial first guess in the maximization . in the current analysis , the maximum number of consecutive events for the initial test has been increased with respect to @xcite to m = 10 , improving the sensitivity to longer flares .",
    "this brings the performance of the analysis close to that of the corresponding time - integrated analysis at large time scales .",
    "given that more than 5 events are required for discovery for @xmath74 days ( see fig  [ fig6.1 ] ) , if the maximum is not increased the method will occasionally only find a subset of the injected events , hence increasing the total signal required to cross the threshold for discovery .",

    "the fact that the 50% 5@xmath3 discovery potential curve descends below the 90% median upper limit curve is due to the effect of poisson statistics .",
    "the untriggered search must observe at least two events in order to identify a flare .",
    "for a simulated flaring source which injects a mean number of events @xmath0 , @xmath0 must equal at least 1.68 for 50% of simulated trials corresponding to 2 or more signal events .",

    "their observations are nevertheless extremely important for neutrino searches , because they detect photons at tev energies that are potentially better correlated to neutrinos of the energies to which icecube is sensitive .",
    "while these observatories can issue alerts for source activity , they often can not constrain the beginning or end of the activity to within a few days . for alerts such as these",

    ", there was no overlap between sources with flares seen by fermi and by iacts and tested in this paper .",
    "the nature of this analysis is a simple cut in time between @xmath122 and @xmath123 , which can be expressed as :    @xmath124    where @xmath61 is the arrival time of the event , @xmath123 and @xmath122 are the predefined the upper and lower bounds of the time window defining the flare , and @xmath125 is the heavyside step function .",

    "five of the seven flares tested with the 22 string data ( table [ ic22flare ] ) showed no excess of events in the vicinity of the corresponding sources in the selected time windows , while s5 0716 + 71 and 1es 1959 + 650 showed one event each .",

    "in this paper we discuss four time - dependent searches : two are `` untriggered '' and scan over direction , energy and time to find clusters of neutrino events ; the others are `` triggered '' by multi - wavelength information . while the first two searches are generic and sensitive to flares not seen in photons , the others are more sensitive because of the reduced trial factor but concern specific catalogues of variable sources .",
    "time - dependent searches can be more sensitive to short flares thanks to the reduction of the background of atmospheric muons and neutrinos over short time scales .",
    "the untriggered search using a predefined catalogue of 40 variable sources shows a post - trial @xmath2-value of 95% and upper limits on the fluence are calculated ( see table [ table_ic40list_results ] ) .",
    "eight of these sources are also triggered on observed flares in the triggered search .",

    "<S> searches which integrate over time are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a larger background of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the use of additional timing information . flaring </S>",
    "<S> sources considered here , such as active galactic nuclei , soft gamma - ray repeaters and gamma - ray bursts , are promising candidate neutrino emitters .    </S>",
    "<S> two searches are `` untriggered '' in the sense that they look for any possible flare in the entire sky and from a predefined catalog of sources from which photon flares have been recorded . </S>",
    "<S> the other two searches are triggered by multi - wavelength information on flares from blazars and from a soft gamma - ray repeater . </S>",
    "<S> one triggered search uses lightcurves from fermi - lat which provides continuous monitoring . </S>",
    "<S> a second triggered search uses information where the flux states have been measured only for short periods of time near the flares . </S>",
    "<S> the untriggered searches use data taken by 40 strings of icecube between apr 5 , 2008 and may 20 , 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> the triggered searches also use data taken by the 22-string configuration of icecube operating between may 31 , 2007 and apr 5 , 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> the results from all four searches are compatible with a fluctuation of the background . </S>"
