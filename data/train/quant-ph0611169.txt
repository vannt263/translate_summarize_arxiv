    "the orbital angular momentum of light beams is a consequence of their azimuthal phase structure @xcite .",
    "light beams with a phase factor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an integer and @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle , carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of @xmath3 per photon along the beam axis @xcite .",
    "these light beams can be generated in the laboratory by optical devices which manipulate the phase of the beam , such as spiral phase plates or holograms . in cases where such a device generates a light beam with an integer value of @xmath1 , the resulting phase structure has the form of @xmath4 intertwined helices of equal phase . for integer values of @xmath1 the chosen height of the phase step generated by the optical device is equal to the mean value of the oam in the resulting beam .",
    "recently , spiral phase steps with fractional step height @xcite as well as special holograms @xcite have been used to generate light beams with fractional oam . here , the generating optical device imposes a phase change of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is not restricted to integer values .",
    "the phase structure of such beams shows a far more complex pattern ; a series of optical vortices with alternating charge is created in a dark line along the direction of the phase discontinuity imprinted by the optical device @xcite . in order to obtain the mean value of the orbital angular momentum of these beams one has to average over the vortex pattern .",
    "interestingly , this mean value coincides with the phase - step only for integer and half - integer values .",
    "our aim is to exploit the well - known formal connections between optics and quantum theory to represent beams with fractional oam as quantum states .",
    "we anticipate that this will be particularly useful , when applied to single photons and related quantum phenomena .",
    "until now , the theoretical description of light modes with fractional oam has been based on the generating optical device . for integer oam values",
    ", however , a fundamental theoretical description exists which provides the only known way to treat the angle itself as quantum mechanical hermitian operator @xcite .",
    "this description provides the underlying theory for a secure quantum communication system @xcite and it gives a form of the uncertainty relation for angle and angular momentum which has been confirmed in an optical experiment @xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalise this theory to fractional values of @xmath6 thereby creating a quantum mechanical description of fractional oam .",
    "such a rigorous formulation is of particular interest as the use of half - integer spiral phase plates has been reported recently in actual and proposed experimental schemes to study high - dimensional entanglement @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that fractional oam states are characterised not only by the height of the phase step but also by the orientation of the phase dislocation @xmath7 .",
    "for half odd - integer values of @xmath6 , that is for @xmath8 , states with the same @xmath6 but with a @xmath9 difference in @xmath7 are orthogonal . in light of recent applications of integer oam in quantum key distribution @xcite and",
    "the conversion of spin to orbital angular momentum in an optical medium @xcite a rigorous formulation is important for possible applications of fractional oam to quantum communication .",
    "the component of the oam in the propagation direction @xmath10 and the azimuthal rotation angle form a pair of conjugate variables @xcite . unlike linear position and momentum , which are both defined on an unbound and continuous state space ,",
    "the state spaces for oam and the rotation angle are different in nature ; whereas the oam eigenstates form a discrete set of states @xmath11 with @xmath1 taking on all integer values , eigenstates of the angle operator are restricted to a @xmath12 radian interval , as it is physically impossible to distinguish between rotation angles differing by @xmath12 radians .",
    "the properties of the angle operator are rigorously derived in an arbitrarily large , yet finite state space of @xmath13 dimensions @xcite .",
    "this space is spanned by the angular momentum states @xmath14 with @xmath1 ranging from @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath12 radian interval @xmath16 is spanned by @xmath17 orthogonal angle states @xmath18 with @xmath19 . here , @xmath20 determines the starting point of the interval and with it a particular angle operator @xmath21 . only after physical results",
    "have been calculated within this state space is @xmath22 allowed to tend to infinity , which recovers the result of an infinite but countable number of basis states for the oam and a dense set of angle states within a @xmath12 radian interval .",
    "we conduct the analysis of fractional oam in the finite dimensional space .",
    "after we have calculated expectation values or probabilities we can give final results in the limit of @xmath23 .    a quantum state with fractional oam",
    "is denoted by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath1 is the integer part and @xmath26 is the fractional part . we choose ` fractional ' rather than ` non - integer ' to follow the terminology in earlier work , but @xmath27 can take on every real number @xmath28 not just rational numbers .",
    "this distinction , however , is not relevant for practical purposes .",
    "the state @xmath24 is decomposed in angle states according to @xmath29 in general @xmath30 will be a multivalued function but a common way to render a multi - valued function single - valued is the introduction of a branch cut @xcite , which restricts the range of the function .",
    "usually , the branch cut is chosen to be along the negative real axis in the complex plane , such that the function has no discontinuities . here , we choose the position of the branch cut @xmath7 , that is the position of the discontinuity in the function @xmath30 , independently of @xmath20 , the starting angle of the @xmath12 radian interval .",
    "to achieve this we introduce an integer - valued function @xmath31 which takes on the values @xmath32 and @xmath33 , depending on whether @xmath34 is smaller or greater than @xmath7 : @xmath35 it is important to note that @xmath7 is bounded by @xmath36 , so that the orientation of the discontinuity is always understood as measured from @xmath20 .",
    "we should stress that according to the mathematical definition we do not create a branch of the multivalued function , as we explicitly include the discontinuity . with this construction",

    "for the appropriate choice of input state , phase shift and orientation this is equivalent to the action of a spiral phase plate operator acting on an integer oam state @xcite .",
    "it is formally possible to introduce a unitary operator @xmath40 which rotates the position of the discontinuity by writing @xmath41 , where @xmath42 such that the index of the operator is matched by the integer part of @xmath6 .",
    "we have introduced @xmath43 as short hand notation for the modulo @xmath12 addition . the action of the operator @xmath40 on a general state @xmath44 results , not only in a rotation of the orientation , but also in a phase shift : @xmath45 | m'(\\alpha \\oplus \\beta ) \\rangle.\\ ] ] further properties of this operator are described in appendix [ app : unitaryrotation ] .",

    "the phase is represented in false colour , such that the colours for the phase of @xmath33 and @xmath12 are identical .",
    "a vortex corresponds to a point where all colours meet and for a vortex of strength @xmath147 a circle surrounding the vortex goes through the colour circle once .",
    "the sign of @xmath153 determines if the colours run through the circle clockwise or anti - clockwise .",
    "the most prominent feature in the phase profiles is the creation of additional vortices in the region of zero intensity for half odd - integer phase steps . in figure ( [ fig : phase35]a ) , for @xmath151 , one can see that there are no additional vortices , while in figure ( [ fig : phase35]b ) one pair of vortices has formed and another pair is in the process of forming . at greater propagating distances",
    "the series of vortex pairs moves closer together . from the different rotation sense for the colours",
    "it can be seen that the vortices in this series have alternating charge .",
    "the vortices annihilate each other differently depending on whether the phase step has a fractional part @xmath27 of just under @xmath143 or just over @xmath143 @xcite .",

    "this rotation would be uniform , but due to the presence of the imprinted phase discontinuity , which does not change under propagation , the rotation of the phase pattern changes .",
    "if one follows for example the red line of zero phase roughly along the negative @xmath155-axis in figure [ fig : phase35]a , this line will rotate counter - clockwise on propagation and at some distance it will be oriented along the negative @xmath156 axis . within the same propagation distance the line of zero phase , that is roughly oriented along the positive @xmath155 axis , will rotate through the phase discontinuity until it is oriented along the negative @xmath155 axis . over the same propagation distance these two lines of zero phase",

    "fractional modes develop a number of features which can only be seen in the exact solution .",
    "although the paraxial solution approaches the exact solution for @xmath157 the paraxial solution does not show the changing position of the integer vortices or the formation and movement in the chain of vortices .",
    "in this article we have derived a rigorous quantum formulation of fractional orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",
    "this formalism is a generalisation of the quantum theory of rotation angles by barnett and pegg @xcite to fractional values of the oam .",
    "fractional values of oam require the introduction of a branch cut in the angle representation of the oam eigenfunctions .",
    "the orientation of the branch cut is an additional parameter in the description of fractional oam .",
    "we have calculated the overlap of two general fractional oam states and we have found that for half odd - integer values of the oam and a relative orientation of @xmath9 radian the overlap is zero and the corresponding states are orthogonal .",
    "this confirms earlier work on fractional oam with half - integer spiral phase plates @xcite .",
    "we have applied our theory to the propagation of light beams with fractional oam . for light carrying integer oam a stable optical vortex of corresponding integer strength forms on the propagation axes . for fractional",
    "oam no fractional strength vortices are stable on propagation , and instead a number of strength @xmath147 vortices are formed in the central region of the beam . additionally , a line of low intensity is visible corresponding to the orientation of the branch cut or the phase step discontinuity in the generating optical device . for",
    "half - integer phase steps a chain of additional vortices with alternating charge is formed in this region of low intensity .",
    "we have confirmed theoretical and experimental results regarding the evolution of optical vortices in light beams with fractional oam .",
    "further to existing theories we have calculated the propagated fields in the paraxial and non - paraxial regime for an incident beam of finite width .",
    "the gradual formation of additional vortices in the region of low intensity is a phenomenon which is only visible in the non - paraxial solution .",
