    "diffractive events in @xmath0 collisions are characterized by the presence of a leading proton or antiproton which remains intact , and/or a rapidity gap , defined as a pseudorapidity of a particle is defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the polar angle of the particle with respect to the proton beam direction . ]",
    "region devoid of particles .",
    "diffractive events involving hard processes ( `` hard diffraction '' ) , such as production of high @xmath3 jets ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diff_diagram ] ) , have been studied extensively to understand the nature of the exchanged object , the pomeron , which in qcd is a color singlet entity with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "one of the most interesting questions in hard diffractive processes is whether or not they obey qcd factorization , in other words , whether the pomeron has a universal , process independent , parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "results on diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) from the @xmath4 collider hera show that qcd factorization holds in ddis",
    ". however , single diffractive ( sd ) rates of @xmath5-boson @xcite , dijet @xcite , @xmath6-quark @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite production relative to non - diffractive ones measured at cdf are @xmath8(10 ) lower than expectations from pdfs determined at hera , indicating a severe breakdown of factorization in hard diffraction between tevatron and hera .",
    "the suppression factor at the tevatron relative to hera is approximately equal in magnitude to that measured in soft diffraction cross sections relative to regge theory predictions based on regge factorization .",
    "the suppression relative to predictions based on ddis pdfs is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_jj ] , which shows the `` diffractive structure function '' @xmath9 measured at cdf by using diffractive dijet data with a leading antiproton detected in roman pots @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 ( integrated over antiproton momentum loss @xmath11 and four momentum transfer squared @xmath12 ) was obtained as a function of @xmath13 , the momentum fraction of the parton in the pomeron , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is @xmath16-bjorken of the parton in the antiproton , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_jj ] ) , by measuring the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive dijet rates and using the known leading order pdfs of the proton .",
    "the measured suppression of @xmath9 relative to the expectation from the h1 pdfs is approximately equal to that observed in soft diffraction .",
    "cdf has also studied dijet events with a double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) topology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_diagram ] ) using the roman pot trigger sample at @xmath17 gev @xcite . by measuring the ratio of dpe to sd dijet rates ( @xmath18 ) and comparing it with that of sd to nd rates ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "a breakdown of qcd factorization was observed as a discrepancy of the double ratio @xmath20 from unity .",
    "in run ii , being currently under way , cdf plans to study various topics on diffraction , including @xmath21 and @xmath11 dependence of @xmath9 in sd , gap width dependence of @xmath9 in dpe , production of exclusive dijet , heavy flavor and low mass states in dpe , and dijets with a large gap in - between jets .",
    "two recently installed `` miniplug '' ( mp ) calorimeters cover the region @xmath22 , and 7 stations of scintillation counters , called beam shower counters ( bsc ) , mounted around the beam pipe , extend the coverage to the very forward region of @xmath23 . the roman pots ( rp ) used in run",
    "i were re - installed and are being operated to trigger on leading antiprotons in the kinematic range @xmath24 and @xmath25 gev@xmath26 .",
    "= 3.5 cm    = 6.0 cm",
    "triggering on a leading antiproton in the rp in conjunction with at least one calorimeter tower with @xmath27 gev , a study of diffractive dijet events has been performed . from a sample of 352k triggered events , about 15k sd dijet events with dijets of corrected @xmath27 gev in the range @xmath24",
    "were obtained .",
    "the @xmath11 ( fractional momentum loss of antiproton ) was measured by using all calorimeter information . using a non - diffractive dijet sample triggered on the same calorimeter tower requirement ,",
    "the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive dijet rates was measured as a function of @xmath16-bjorken of the parton in the antiproton , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_xbj ] .",
    "this figure shows that ( i ) the ratio observed with run ii data in approximately the same kinematic region as in run i reproduces the run i results , and ( ii ) there is no appreciable @xmath11 dependence in the ratio , as already seen in run i. measurement of the @xmath11 dependence at still lower @xmath11 values ( @xmath28 ) is one of our run ii goals and is being currently under study .",
    "preliminary results of the @xmath21 dependence of the ratio , where @xmath21 is defined as the square of average value of the mean dijet @xmath3 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_xbj ] .",
    "no significant @xmath21 dependence is observed , indicating that the pomeron evolves with @xmath21 in a similar way as the proton .",
    "for a study of dpe dijets in run ii , a dedicated trigger has been implemented that requires a rapidity gap in the bsc in the outgoing proton direction in addition to the presence of a leading antiproton in the rp and a single calorimeter tower of @xmath27 gev .",
    "the requirement of a bsc gap on the proton side enhances the dpe signal , as can be seen in the two - dimensional lego plot of mp versus bsc hit multiplicity of sd dijet events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dpe ] ) .",
    "offline , requiring in addition a gap in the proton - side mp , we obtained about 16k dijet events ( about 100 times more data than in run i ) , which are qualitatively consistent with dpe dijets .",
    "figure  [ fig : dpe ] ( middle and right ) shows the @xmath3 , mean @xmath29 and azimuthal angle difference @xmath30 of the two leading jets for the dpe candidate events ( points ) .",
    "as seen in run i dpe data , the @xmath3 distributions look similar to those of sd dijets ( histograms ) , while the mean @xmath29 and @xmath30 show that the dpe dijets are more central and more back - to - back .",
