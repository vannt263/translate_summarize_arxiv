    "e.g. _ , mott insulator@xcite and high temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "motivated by the experiments of high temperature superconductors , people have been look for spin liquid phase@xcite that does not break any symmetry in in large @xmath0 hubbard model and its generalization .",
    "recently , meng _",
    "_ @xcite have studied the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method .",
    "they only consider the bipartite system in which the hamiltonian only connects states on different sublattices .",
    "the reason is that the qmc does not have sign problem in this case .",
    "they report a gapped spin liquid phase for a range of u / t .",
    "this phase is an insulating that does not appear to break any symmetry .",
    "the true nature of the phase is still under debate .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied the phase diagram of the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice ( see fig . 1 and 2 ) using the generalized slave - particle technique @xcite which include charge fluctuations . within meanfield approximation , we find a mott phase transition to the insulating phase at @xmath1 above which charge gap opens up and we obtain the gapped spin liquid phase ( spin / charge gapped phase ) .",
    "there is also another phase transition between the spin liquid and the anti - ferromagnetic order phases at @xmath2 . in this phase , in contrast to the the gapped spin liquid phase , the mass of spinons is very small and negligible . in the case of nearest neighbor hopping hubbard model , which is a bipartite system ,",
    "the gauge theory of our meanfield spin liquid phase is the compact staggered u(1 ) . in this phase ,",
    "all excitations are gapped except gauge fluctuations .",
    "these results are within mean - field and due to the compactness of the u(1 ) lattice gauge theory , stability of such mean - field states are under question . in compact @xmath3 gauge theories , instanton ( anti - instanton ) configurations",
    "are allowed and when they proliferate , spinons become confined and the results of the mean - field are no longer valid . therefore studying",
    "the fate of this gapped spin liquid is necessary .",
    "in this paper we find that instanton configurations are relevant .",
    "instantons have nonzero fugacity and we do obtain a confined phase . more importantly , instanton operators carry a non - trivial crystal momentum .",
    "also , under 60 degree lattice rotation and parity , an instanton is changed to an anti - instanton",
    ". however , the instantons carry trivial quantum numbers for other symmetries .",
    "since a triple instanton carries trivial quantum numbers for all symmetries , so triple instanton can proliferate which leads to a confined phase .",
    "since single instanton carries non - trivial crystal momentum , this allows us to conclude that the @xmath3 confined phase is a phase that break translation symmetry but not spin rotation symmetry .",
    "therefore we finally obtain an insulating phase at half filling that breaks the lattice translation symmetry ! on the other hand , in the presence of second neighbor hopping in the hubbard model the charge / spin gapped phase can be spin liquid that do not break translation , parity , 60 degree lattice rotation , and spin rotation symmetries .",
    "+     ( @xmath4 ) , as a function of @xmath5 . there is a phase transition to the anti - ferromagnetic order at @xmath6 .",
    "after ref .",

    "[ fig : subfigureexample ]    since the unit cell of the honeycomb lattice has two sites in it , and we can label them by a and b or @xmath7 , any lattice point can be represented as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ( a is the lattice spacing between a and b atoms ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 takes 0 and 1 values .",
    "the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice are @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . type a atoms are connected to type b atoms by the following three vectors : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "honeycomb lattice is invariant under five symmetry transformations : time reversal , parity @xmath17 , 60 degree rotation ( @xmath18 ) , translation along @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is easy to check these symmetry operations act on the lattice as the following @xcite : @xmath23",
    "in the anderson - zou slave particle method , electron operators are represented as : @xmath24 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }                               f_{i,\\sigma}^\\dag \\\\",
    "\\sigma f_{i,-\\sigma }                             \\end{array}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 creates a state with a single electron on it ( a spinon ) , @xmath26 creates a state with no charge on it ( a holon ) , and @xmath27 creates a state with two electron on site @xmath28 ( a doublon ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the physical hilbert space contains only four states : empty state ( holon ) , one electron ( spinon ) and two electrons ( doublon ) on each site .",
    "so we always have one and only one slave particle on each site .",
    "so we conclude that we should put the local constraint @xmath29 , to get rid of redundant states .",
    "this is the physical constraint which should be satisfied on every site .",
    "we could also obtain this result by noting that the electron operators are fermion and should satisfy the anticommutation relations . from the definition of @xmath30 it is obvious that it is invariant under u(1 ) gauge transformation ( we require @xmath31 and @xmath32 to remain bosonic operators i.e. , preserve their statistics after transformation , otherwise we would have su(2 ) gauge invariance .",
    "however at @xmath33 we have only fermions and only in that case we have su(2 ) gauge symmetry ) .",
    "it is worth noting that all the slave particles carry the same charge under the internal u(1 ) gauge . since the above constraint and as a result the hubbard hamiltonian are also gauge invariant , so is the action of the hubbard model .    using this slave technique",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian can be rewritten as the following : @xmath34 in which we have used these notations @xmath35 . within mean field and by using hubbard - stratonovic we can decouple spinons and bosons and obtain a mean field state . in our numerical studies",
    "we have obtained three phases . at small u / t limit",
    "we obtain a semi - metallic phase . at large u / t limit",
    "we obtain af order and for moderate values of u / t we obtain a spin liquid phase .",
    "now let us focus on the spin liquid phase . in this phase",
    ": @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the effective hamiltonian of spinons in this phase is of the following forms : @xmath37    now let us use the following ansatz : @xmath38 .",
    "so we have @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the structure factor of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "therefore the energy spectrum of spinons are : @xmath41 . from the energy spectrum",
    "we see that spinons are gapped .",
    "but what if we include the effect of instantons ? to answer this important question , we first study the gauge theory of this mean - field state .    in the above effective hamiltonian",
    "we transform operators as : @xmath42 and @xmath43 for any arbitrary phase @xmath44 , _ i.e. _ assuming a staggered global gauge transformation , then the effective hamiltonian does not change",
    ". therefore the @xmath45 of the hamiltonian is staggered @xmath3 .",
    "the reason is that there is no hopping term due to the non - zero charge gap and the if we the gauge transformation of two neighboring sites have opposite phases , the total phase change of the pairing term becomes zero and therefore gauge fluctuations are described by staggered compact @xmath3 instead of compact @xmath3 gauge theory .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming have positive unit charge on sublattice a and negative unit charge on sublattice b for slave particles under the internal gauge transformation .",
    "so , at mean field level , the charge / spin gapped phase has a neutral spinless @xmath3 gapless mode as its only low energy excitations .",
    "however , it is well known that @xmath3 theory in 2 + 1d is confined due to instanton effects .",
    "so in the latter part of this paper , we will assume that the @xmath3 fluctuations are weak and use the semiclassical approach to study the @xmath3 confined phase where the @xmath3 mode is gapped .",
    "we like to remark that it is possible to break this staggered compact @xmath3 down to a @xmath46 @xcite one by anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "if we add second neighbor hopping to the hubbard model , within slave boson this term generate pairing terms of the form @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e. _ it induces the same sublattice pairing and the hamiltonian is no longer invariant under the staggered global @xmath3 gauge transformation . in this case",
    "gauge fluctuations are gapped and thus our mean filed state is stable and we can trust our results . therefore for this case spin liquid phase",
    "is physical . on the frustrated lattices like the triangular lattice",
    "the gauge theory is @xmath46 because we can not dive the lattice in two sublattices , a and b.    it is useful to do particle hole transformation on sublattice @xmath48 , so that we can see the gauge theory of the transformed hamiltonian manifestly : @xmath49    in the absence of @xmath50 energy band of spinons has two nodal points around @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "3).if we expand the @xmath53 around these two points we have : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "so we have 8 flavors of spinons depending on their physical spin degree of freedom , sublattice index , and wether their momentum is around @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "therefore we define the 8 component spinor as : @xmath58 . using the linearized hamiltonian around @xmath56 and @xmath57 it is straightforward to show that the continuum model can be written as : @xmath59\\psi{\\left(x\\right)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 ( @xmath610,1,2,3 ) are pauli matrices acting on the sublattice indices , @xmath62 are pauli matrices acting on the physical spin , and @xmath63 are pauli matrices that act on the valley indices . it is known that if filled band has a nontrivial total chern number , then instanton effects can be ignored , since the nontrivial chern number lead to a chern - simons term for the @xmath3 gauge field .",
    "so we need to calculate the chern number of the filled band .",
    "we will calculate the chern number through the dirac nodes .",
    "each dirac node contribute @xmath64 chern numbers , and each filled band have an even number of dirac nodes . so adding the contribution from all the dirac nodes , we obtain an integer chern number for the filled band .",
    "let us consider the following two by two dirac theory : @xmath65 \\psi{\\left(x\\right)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 are pauli matrices .",
    "the mass of the above hamiltonian is by definition @xmath67 .",
    "it has been shown that each massive dirac cone with mass @xmath67 has @xmath68 nontrivial chern number @xcite .",
    "now let us consider following hamiltonian : @xmath69 \\psi{\\left(x\\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we us the following transformation : @xmath70 , then the above hamiltonian can be rearranged as the following : @xmath71 \\psi'{\\left(x\\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the mass of this hamiltonian is @xmath72 , and therefore it has @xmath73 nontrivial chern number .    using the above arguments it can be shown that the mass of the two dirac cones at @xmath74 is @xmath75 and they contribute @xmath76 chern number .",
    "the mass of the two other dirac cones at @xmath77 is @xmath78 and they contribute @xmath79 chern number .",
    "therefore the total chern number of our theory is @xmath80 .",
    "so the coefficient of the chern - simon action is zero , and it does not constraint the proliferation of instantons .    on the other hand since we have a massive dirac theory , instant - instanton correlation function at large distances does not decay exponentially",
    ". therefore nothing prevents instantons from proliferation . they will proliferate and gap out the gauge particles .",
    "so the @xmath3 gauge theory is in the confined phase .",
    "now we should compute the quantum numbers@xcite of instantons , in order to understand the symmetry properties of the @xmath3 confined phase . to do so",
    "let us first derive the instanton operators .    since instantons ( instantons ) in the presence of the chern - simon action with chern number @xmath81 ,",
    "create @xmath81 fermions , therefore the instanton operator creates @xmath82 fermions at @xmath74 ( _ i.e. _ annihilates 1 fermion at @xmath83 ) , and creates @xmath84 fermions at @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , we obtain many different possibilities for the instanton operators , which include :    @xmath85    it is obvious that all the above operators carry nonzero crystal momentum which is equal to @xmath86 .",
    "since the microscopic hubbard hamiltonian does not break translation symmetry , therefore the single instanton operator can not appear in the path integral .",
    "on the other hand since @xmath87 , triple - instanton is not forbidden and will appear in the path integral .",
    "so the the path integral contain a triple - instanton gas , which will cause a confinement of the @xmath3 theory .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .symmetry transformation rules of spinon operators under translation , time reversal , parity and @xmath88 rotation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now we like to compute other nontrivial quantum numbers of the above instanton operators . to do so ,",
    "let us first comment on the transformation of the continuum wave - function .",
    "using transformation rules in table 1 , we obtain following relations :    @xmath89    _ physical spin rotation around z axis by angle @xmath90 _ : @xmath91    @xmath89    _ physical spin rotation around y axis . by angle @xmath90",

    "using symmetry transformation of continuum wavefunction , we can read the corresponding transformation of monopole operators . under @xmath88 rotation ( @xmath18 )",

    "[ fig : subfigureexample ]",
    "we have found a triple - instanton operator that has all symmetries of the microscopic hamiltonian . therefore this term is relevant and has a non - zero fugacity .",
    "because of instanton proliferation , the u(1 ) gauge fluctuations are now gapped out . on the other hand , since single instanton operator carries nonzero crystal momentum , the translation symmetry breaks spontaneously . to have a better insight of the situation , we can use the duality between @xmath3 gauge theory and the nonlinear sigma model . if we identify @xmath113 operator with @xmath116 , then @xmath117 . the @xmath3 gauge theory with triple - instantons",

    "this model has three inequivalent ground states determined for @xmath122 ( see fig .",
    "therefore the ground - state degeneracy of our model is also three .",
    "this happens because we lose the translation symmetry along @xmath19 and @xmath20 direction .",

    "but it is easy to show that @xmath113 is invariant under @xmath123 and @xmath124 transformation .",
    "so the basis vectors of the new lattice are @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the area of the unit cell is three times bigger and it contains six atoms in it .    in summary ,",
    "if we treat the u(1 ) gauge field as a semi - classical field ( _ i.e._gaussian approximation ) , by analogy to the nonlinear sigma model , instantons proliferate , gauge field gaps out and lattice symmetry spontaneously breaks .",
