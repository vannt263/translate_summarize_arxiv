    "there has been considerable interest in the localized solutions of the einstein s equations with nonlinear field sources in recent years ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "gravitating non - abelian solitons and black holes with yang - mills fields is investigated in @xcite .",
    "such problems were not investigated earlier in the history of gr , mainly because of two reasons : 1 .",
    "it was widely accepted that the gravitational effects are too weak to affect -in an essential way- the properties of soliton solutions of nonlinear field theories .",
    "2 . the resulting equations are usually formidable such that the ordinary analytical approaches become idle .",
    "more recently , however , the availability of high speed computers and advanced numerical methods have changed the case , and extensive numerical attempts have been made in this direction ( see e.g. 387n term project in @xcite ) .",
    "it has emerged from recent studies that the effects due to the inclusion of gravity are not always negligible .",
    "consider , for example , the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) system .",
    "it has been shown that the eym equations have both soliton and black hole solutions ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the fact that vacuum einstein and pure yang - mills equations do not have by themselves soliton solutions .",
    "we can therefore conclude that gravity may have dramatic effects on the existence or non - existence of soliton solutions of nonlinear field equations .",
    "another interesting example is the discovery that black hole solutions may have skyrmion hair @xcite .",
    "it was previously believed that stationary black holes can only have global charges given by surface integrals at spatial infinity ( the so - called no - hair theorem ) .    in the ordinary o(3 )",
    "model , spherically symmetric solutions have an energy density which behave like @xmath0 at large distances ( @xcite ) .",
    "when formulated in a curved background , this model leads to a spacetime which is not asymptotically flat , and the adm mass is not well defined ( @xcite ) . a nonlinear o(3 )",
    "model ( thereafter referred to as the isovector model ) was introduced in ( @xcite ) , which possesses spherical , soliton - like solutions with a @xmath1 energy density at large distances .",
    "such a model , is therefore expected to be well behaved in an asymptotically flat background . in the present paper",
    ", we examine this model , and discuss its self - gravitating solutions .",
    "these new solutions are compared with those obtained previously in a flat spacetime .",
    "the present manuscript is organized in the following way . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we will review the isovector model of @xcite . in section [ sec3 ] , flat - space solitons of the isovector model and their resemblence to charged particles",
    "are introduced . in section [ sec4 ] , the isovector model will be reformulated in a curved background . the resulting differential equations for a spherically symmetric ansatz will be introduced in this section , together with the necessary boundary conditions .",
    "these equations will be solved numerically , for several choices of the coupling constant .",
    "we will compare the self gravitating solutions with those obtained for a flat spacetime .",
    "soliton masses using the tolman formalism will be discussed in section [ sec5 ] , together with the behavior as a function of the model parameter .",
    "section [ sec6 ] will contain the summary and conclusion .",
    "consider an isovector field @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with a @xmath4 vacuum at @xmath5 each component @xmath2 is a pseudo - scalar under spacetime transformations , and @xmath6 is a constant .",
    "a topological current can be defined for such a field according to ( @xcite ) @xmath7 for the time being , spacetime is assumed to be the flat minkowski spacetime and @xmath8 with @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is assumed throught this paper ) . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the totally anti - symmetric tensor densities in 4 and 3 dimensions , respectively . it can be easily shown that the current ( [ topcur ] ) is identically conserved ( @xmath13 ) , and the total charge is quantized @xmath14 where @xmath15 . in this equation ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are area elements of @xmath4 surfaces in the @xmath18-space ( as @xmath19 ) and @xmath20-space ( as @xmath21 ) , respectively .",
    "the current ( [ topcur ] ) can identically be written as the covariant divergence of an anti - symmetric , second - rank tensor @xmath22 where @xmath23,\\ ] ] in which @xmath24 is an auxiliary vector field .",
    "the dual field @xmath25 with the tensorial components @xmath26 satisfies the equation @xmath27 provided that the vector field @xmath28 is a solution of the following wave equation @xmath29 it can be easily shown that the right hand side of this equation defines another conserved current @xmath30 with @xmath31 using the language of differential forms , ( [ feq ] ) can be written in the following form @xmath32 where the components of the 2-forms @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 we now have @xmath37 and @xmath38 the 2-form @xmath39 is therefore hodge - decomposable , and cohomologous with @xmath33 ( i.e. they belong to the same cohomology class , since they differ only by an exact form ) .",
    "the resemblance of equations ( [ max1 ] ) and ( [ max2 ] ) to the maxwell s equations and the capability of this model to provide non - singular solutions behaving like charged particles were discussed in @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we will only outline the main results valid in a flat spacetime .",
    "the requirement of having non - singular , finite energy and stable solitons , severely restrict the possible choices of the lagrangian density of the isovector field .",
    "let us follow @xcite , and adopt the following lagrangian density which satisfies the above requirements : @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 real constants .",
    "the potential @xmath43 satisfies the following conditions @xmath44 which leads to the spontaneous breaking of the ( global ) @xmath45 symmetry of the system . the dynamical equation for the isovector field",
    "is easily obtained , using the variational principle @xmath46 , which leads to @xmath47 similar to the ansatz used in the skyrme model ( @xcite ) , we start with the so - called hedgehog ansatz @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath3 represent the euclidean coordinates @xmath18 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , respectively",
    ". this ansatz immediately leads to @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the unit vector in the radial direction , and @xmath55 is the elementary topological charge defined in ( [ topcharge ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the charge density corresponding to this ansatz is easily obtained to be @xmath58 which leads to @xmath59 showing that the ansatz bears unit topological charge . note that in deriving this result , we have used the boundary conditions @xmath60 and @xmath61 it can be shown that the following asymptotic solutions are valid : @xmath62 , \\ ] ] close to the center of the soliton ( @xmath63 ) , where @xmath64 is a dimensionless constant , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 far from the soliton ( i.e. @xmath19 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the total soliton energy @xmath67 4\\pi r^2 dr=5.21\\phi_o^3\\left [ b_o(-4\\lambda)^3\\right]^{1/4}.\\ ] ] using the scale transformation @xmath68 ( while keeping @xmath20 unchanged ) , it can be shown that @xmath69 has a minimum at @xmath70 , which is a signature of the stability of the soliton under radial perturbations .",
    "by self - gravitating isovector solitons , we mean static solutions of the coupled isovector - gravitational equations which are everywhere regular and represent localized lumps of energy . by numerically integrating the coupled nonlinear equations",
    ", we will show that such solutions do arise depending on the value of the model parameters . based on or results",
    ", we will also criticize the widely expressed view that gravity has only a minute effect on the structure and properties of extended solitons .",
    "let us start with the action@xmath71 in which @xmath33 is the gravitational constant , @xmath72 is the curvature scalar , @xmath73 is the lagrangian density of the matter source , and @xmath74 is the determinant of the metric tensor . as the source of gravity , we consider the isovector field ( [ isolag ] ) . by varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath75 and @xmath2",
    ", we obtain the corresponding field equations : @xmath76 , \\ ] ] and @xmath77 by contracting equation ( [ einseq ] ) , we obtain the following equation for the curvature scalar:@xmath78 this equation is useful , since it expresses a simple relation between the curvature scalar and the self - interaction potential of the isovector field , and provides a means to check some of the calculations .",
    "we employ the coordinates @xmath79 , and the general , spherically symmetric , static metric @xmath80 . for the hedgehog ansatz ( [ hedge ] ) ,",
    "the independent field equations become @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 note that equation ( [ isograv ] ) reduces to the flat - space equation ( [ isoeq ] ) , by putting @xmath84 .",
    "equations ( [ met1 ] ) and ( [ met2 ] ) , however , become inconsistent for obvious reasons ( the spacetime can not be flat in the presence of matter sources ) .",
    "let us introduce the following three length scales @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 which appear naturally in equations ( [ met1 ] ) to ( [ isograv ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath88 is proportional to the geometric mean of @xmath89 and @xmath90 : @xmath91    emergence of new length scales is similar to what happens in non - abelian gauge fields ( @xcite ) , and leads to the appearance of new branches of spherical , static solitons .",
    "having additional length scales , one expects departures from the einstein - maxwell solutions and the appearance of more subtle features . using these two length scales , equations ( [ met1 ] ) to ( [ isograv ] )",
    "can be made dimensionless and suitable for numerical integration ; @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 in these equations , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 which is the dimensionless parameter of the system : @xmath98 and @xmath99    the asymptotic behavior of the non - singular solutions can be found by using the following series ansatze : @xmath100 for @xmath101 , and @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "the unknown coefficients are calculated by inserting these ansatze into equations ( [ metdim1 ] ) to ( [ isogravdim ] ) and balancing the terms of the same order in @xmath18 .",
    "table [ coeff ] shows the leading coefficients for the above asymptotics .",
    ".leading , non - vanishing coefficients of the asymptotic solutions . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to solve the coupled nonlinear des numerically , we used the gerald s shooting method , which is based on two guesses for the initial slope of the unknown functions . using these initial guesses ,",
    "the equations are integrated via the runge - kutta - fehlberg method , reaching the end point of the independent variable .",
    "a better guess for the initial slope is then found by comparing the end point values with the boundary conditions , and interpolating for the initial slope ( @xcite ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for asymptotically flat spacetime read @xmath104 and @xmath105 the procedure described above is iterated until the correct boundary values are reached with a reasonable accuracy .    in order to test the method ,",
    "flat space solutions were first computed and compared to the solutions obtained via energy minimization algorithms ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows numerical variations of the @xmath106 function for several values of the parameter @xmath107 .",
    "the corresponding results for the metric coefficients @xmath108 and @xmath109 are shown in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , respectively .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath107 of the order of unity , the self - gravitating solutions differ only slightly from the flat - space solution .",
    "the difference vanishes completely as @xmath110 .",
    "as @xmath107 becomes much smaller than 1 , significant differences with the flat - space solution emerge .",
    "for example , the metric signature changes at some @xmath111 for sufficiently small @xmath107 .",
    "although there are still controversies about an exact definition for the total mass of a self - gravitating system ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) , we adopt the tolman formalism for computing the total mass of the gravitating solitons ; @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 .\\ ] ]    in most cases ( including the model we are discussing here ) , the second term is absent since the matter lagrangian does not contain derivatives of the metric tensor . for the isovector model , we have @xmath115.\\ ] ] using the transformations ( [ epseq ] ) and ( [ weq ] ) , the total mass can be written in terms of a dimensionless integral : @xmath116^{1/4}s_t,\\ ] ] where @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the dimensionless integral @xmath120 were computed numerically for several values of the parameter @xmath107 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ massfig ] .",
    "it is seen that ( 1 ) @xmath121 as @xmath122 , leading to the asymptotic ( flat space ) mass , ( 2 ) there is a maximum mass around @xmath123 , and ( 3 ) the total mass decreases as @xmath124 , with @xmath125 at @xmath126 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that in the asymptotic series solutions summarized in table [ coeff ] , the coefficients @xmath127 and @xmath128 vanish , which imply vanishing total mass of the soliton as deduced from the asymptotic form of the metric @xcite .",
    "we extended the isovector model to incorporate the effects of gravity .",
    "the resulting equations were integrated numerically for spherically symmetric ansatz , using the gerald s shooting method .",
    "it was found that for large values of the dimensionless parameter of the system the effect of gravity is negligible . for small values of @xmath107",
    ", however , gravity has a considerable effect on the qualitative and quantitative behavior of the solutions .",
    "such dramatic changes in the behavior of the spherical solutions in the presence of gravity were also reported in the framework of eym equations ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "gravitating solitons of the isovector model in an asymptotically flat background bear quantized topological charges , exactly similar to the flat - space solitons .",
    "the quantization is due to a @xmath129 homotopy between the boundary of the curved space ( @xmath4 at @xmath130 ) , and the vacuum @xmath4 of the isovector field ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "this is in analogy with the quantization of the magnetic pole intensity in the thooft polyakov monopoles ( @xcite ) .",
    "solutions presented in this paper ( figures [ fig1 ] to [ fig3 ] ) do not exhibit horizons . using the well - known result from general relativity ( @xcite ) , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the emitted ( at @xmath135 ) and detected ( at @xmath136 ) periods of photons ,",
    "event horizons correspond to @xmath137 , which are not fulfilled by the present solutions .",
    "however , the appearance of horizons and signature changes is not ruled out and will be addressed elsewhere . in particular , it should be interesting to know whether isovector black holes have hair . as pointed out in @xcite",
    ", solitons can make bound states with ordinary black holes to form hairy black holes .",
    "in such a case , the total adm mass of the hairy black hole is the sum of the mass of the bare black hole , the mass of the soliton , and the gravitational binding energy between the two ( @xcite ) .",
