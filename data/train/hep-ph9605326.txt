    "if higgs boson(s ) ( generically denoted as @xmath5 ) exist and are discovered at either the cern lhc or a future next linear @xmath6 collider ( nlc ) , it will be extremely important to determine both the magnitude and the cp nature of their couplings . as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , determining the cp properties of a higgs boson through its couplings will be especially challenging .",
    "the most promising approaches proposed to date include : photon polarization asymmetries in @xmath7 @xcite ; momentum correlations among the final state @xmath8 or @xmath9 decay products appearing in @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 or @xmath13 , respectively @xcite ; and weighted cross section integrals in @xmath14 at the lhc @xcite and in @xmath15 at the nlc @xcite .",
    "the latter @xmath16 analyzes examined what can be accomplished using a single observable .",
    "@xcite found that under ideal circumstances a sm - like cp - even higgs boson can be distinguished from a purely cp - odd higgs boson at a statistically significant level using @xmath14 data from the lhc .",
    "@xcite found that a statistically significant signal for the cp - violating cross term generically present in the @xmath15 cross section for a higgs boson with both cp - even and cp - odd components might be possible .",
    "however , neither of these analyzes took full advantage of all the information available in the cross section as a function of the kinematical variables .    in this letter , we outline the optimal technique for determining the coefficients @xmath17 appearing in a cross section that can be written in the generic form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the final state phase space configuration . the application upon which we shall focus is @xmath15 production , where the @xmath17 are functions of the higgs couplings . by extracting the @xmath17",
    "we can determine all the higgs couplings and , thence , its cp nature .",
    "this use of the full information contained in the final state distributions , as encoded in the @xmath17 , leads to significant improvement in the statistical precision with which the couplings / cp - nature of a higgs boson can be determined .",
    "for example , in @xmath15 at @xmath1 , if @xmath20 and final state reconstruction efficiency is of order @xmath21 , a sm - like cp - even higgs boson can be distinguished from a pure cp - odd higgs boson at roughly the @xmath22 statistical level .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are known functions of the location in final state phase space , @xmath19 , and the @xmath17 are model - dependent coefficients ( taken to be dimensionless in our convention ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath17 can be extracted by using appropriate weighting functions @xmath25 such that @xmath26 . in general ,",
    "different choices for the @xmath25 are possible .",
    "however , there is a unique choice such that the statistical error in the determination of the @xmath17 is minimized in the sense that the entire covariance matrix is at a stationary point in terms of varying the functional forms for the @xmath25 while maintaining @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we require @xmath28 \\sigma(\\phi)d\\phi=0\\,,\\quad ( b):~~\\int \\delta w_i(\\phi ) f_j(\\phi)=0\\ , , \\label{variational}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the covariance matrix .",
    "the weighting functions which satisfy these conditions are of the form @xmath30 since , for the @xmath25 so defined , the constraint ( b ) implies the minimization condition ( a ) in eq .",
    "( [ variational ] ) .",
    "we may then compute @xmath17 as @xmath31 it can then be demonstrated that the covariance matrix is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the integrated cross section and @xmath34 is the total number of events , with @xmath35 being the luminosity times efficiency .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( [ cerror ] ) applies only for the optimal weighting functions .",
    "we note that the above procedure is the optimal one regardless of the relative magnitudes of the @xmath17 .",
    "various limits of the optimal weighting functions have previously appeared in the literature .",
    "for example , if all of the @xmath17 are small except for @xmath36 , then to isolate the @xmath17 ( @xmath37 ) the appropriate weighting function reduces to @xmath38 , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our procedure is not altered if cuts are imposed on the kinematical phase space over which one integrates .",
    "although such cuts may be required in the actual experimental analysis , we have not included cuts in our model computations to follow .    in the @xmath15 process , upon which we shall now focus , in order to fully define a point in phase space we must identify the @xmath9 and @xmath39 and have no more than one invisible particle .",
    "thus , we must employ the final state mode in which one @xmath9 decays leptonically and the other hadronically .",
    "further , the @xmath9 and @xmath39 must be reconstructed . the overall efficiency for the mixed leptonic - hadronic final state decays and the double reconstruction will be denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "then the effective luminosity is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the total integrated luminosity .",
    "we shall take @xmath21 .",
    "if a subset , @xmath43 , of the kinematical variables @xmath19 can not be determined ( as is the case for @xmath15 if the @xmath44 decay to the purely hadronic or double - leptonic final state ) the above technique can be applied using the variables , @xmath45 , that _ can _ be observed and the functions @xmath46 .",
    "this is the case even if one or more @xmath47 are zero .",
    "for example , in @xmath48 the @xmath49 that is a cp - odd function of the variables @xmath19 reduces to @xmath50 if one can not distinguish between the @xmath9 and @xmath39 .",
    "we have applied the above procedure to the extraction of higgs couplings using the process @xmath48 .",
    "we define the higgs couplings via the feynman rules : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the usual electroweak coupling constant .",
    "thus , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are defined relative to couplings of sm - magnitude .",
    "the sm higgs boson has @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "a purely cp - odd higgs boson has @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; the magnitude of @xmath54 depends upon the model  we will display results for @xmath60 , which would correspond to @xmath61 in a two - higgs - doublet model of type ii ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) . this latter choice would , in particular , apply for the cp - odd @xmath62 of the minimal supersymmetric model ( with @xmath61 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 cross section contains five distinct terms : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 of these , the only term in @xmath65 that is actually cp - violating is that proportional to @xmath66 ; this is the term upon which ref .  @xcite focused .",
    "our approach makes use of the fact that the full cross section contains additional information regarding both @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we have considered three distinct higgs coupling cases :    * \\i ) the standard model higgs boson , with @xmath56 , @xmath57 . *",
    "\\ii ) a pure cp - odd higgs boson , with @xmath58 , @xmath60 . *",
    "\\iii ) a cp - mixed higgs boson , with @xmath67 .    for unpolarized beams , @xmath1 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the integrated cross sections in cases i , ii and iii are @xmath70 , 0.53 , and @xmath71 , respectively . adopting @xmath72 , we then computed @xmath73 ( see eq .",
    "( [ cerror ] ) ) as a function of location in @xmath74 parameter space , where the @xmath75 for a given case are computed from the model input values of @xmath74 ( given above ) using eq .",
    "( [ cdefs ] ) .",
    "surfaces of constant @xmath76 and 36 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ contour ] for each of the three cases .",
    "we have indicated the parameter space location of models i , ii and iii by a solid bullet , square , and star , respectively .",
    "the @xmath76 surfaces indicate the @xmath77 errors on the parameter determinations .",
    "the @xmath78 ( or @xmath79 ) surfaces will be useful as a reference in assessing the level at which we can distinguish the above three model cases from one another .",
    "=    due to the fact that the five @xmath17 are functions of only the three parameters , @xmath74 , the @xmath76 surfaces in fig .",
    "[ contour ] are not perfect ellipsoids .",
    "nonetheless , we follow the usual procedure of defining the @xmath80 errors in any one of the @xmath74 parameters by the largest and smallest values that the given parameter takes as one moves about the @xmath76 surface .",
    "( these extrema define the locations of the two planes of constant parameter value that are tangent to the @xmath76 surface . )",
    "the resulting @xmath77 errors are tabulated in table  [ abcerrors ] .",
    "( the upper and lower limits for @xmath74 employed for the @xmath76 surface plots of fig .",
    "[ contour ] are only _ just _ beyond the extrema values . )",
    "we observe that @xmath53 is well determined in all cases , but especially for the @xmath81 cases i and iii .",
    "similarly , @xmath54 is well determined in the @xmath59 cases ii and iii .",
    "the magnitude of the error in @xmath55 is similar for all three cases , and is never especially small . of course , a much better measurement (  @xmath82 for a sm - like @xmath5 ) of or bound on @xmath55 will be available from inclusive @xmath83 production",
    "; however , this does not lead to reduced errors for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "some improvement in the errors is possible if the electron beam can be negatively polarized without loss of luminosity ; the errors for @xmath84 are given in the table .",
    "in what follows , we shall only consider the case of unpolarized beams .",
    ".we tabulate the @xmath77 errors , as defined in the text , in @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for the three higgs coupling cases i , ii and iii , assuming @xmath85 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath72 .",
    "results for unpolarized beams and for 100% negative @xmath86 polarization are given . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ modeldisc ]    we can also analyze our ability to determine that the cp - violating component of @xmath65 , proportional to @xmath87 , is non - zero .",
    "we consider model iii ( the only one of our three models for which @xmath88 ) .",
    "we plot the @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) surface in @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath66 space and look for the extrema of @xmath66 .",
    "we find that these extrema occur for @xmath89 and that @xmath66 can range from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , assuming @xmath72 and unpolarized beams .",
    "clearly , we are not far from establishing a non - zero signal at the @xmath77 level . for twice as much luminosity , @xmath92 ,",
    "the extrema of @xmath66 on the @xmath77 surface are + .15 and + .79 , and a non - zero value of @xmath66 would have been established at better than the @xmath77 level . at the @xmath77 level , @xmath72 upper bounds on @xmath93 in models i and ii are 0.65 and 0.55 , respectively .",
    "the above results are all somewhat better than obtained for these same models using either of the observables ( @xmath94 or @xmath95 ) employed in ref .",
    "in this letter , we have outlined the optimal technique for extracting the coefficients that appear in a general cross section which is a sum of model - dependent coefficients times known kinematical functions .",
    "application of this technique to @xmath15 results in good prospects for pinning down the cp nature of the @xmath5 at a @xmath96 @xmath6 collider operating at an expected luminosity of @xmath20 , provided only that the @xmath5 has a reasonable production cross section ( roughly @xmath97 ) and that the @xmath16 final state can be reconstructed with reasonable efficiency ( roughly @xmath98 ) . in particular , for a higgs mass of 100 gev and unpolarized beams , it will be possible to demonstrate , using @xmath15 production only , that a sm higgs boson has the expected cp - even couplings to @xmath13 and @xmath99 within @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively , and that any cp - odd coupling to @xmath13 is less than 76% of the cp - even sm strength .",
    "the precision with which both the cp - odd and cp - even @xmath13 higgs couplings can be determined is somewhat improved for a negatively polarized electron beam , assuming there is no loss of luminosity .",
    "most importantly , the coefficients of the various terms in the @xmath15 cross section can be determined well enough that higgs cp mixtures that are significantly different from one another can generally be distinguished at a substantial ( sometimes very substantial ) level of statistical significance .",
    "we have implicitly assumed that the systematic error in the overall normalization of the @xmath16 cross section will be relatively small ,  @xmath102 .",
    "if this is not the case , then one can focus on the ratios of the different cross section coefficients to one another .",
    "our technique is easily adapted to this situation .",
