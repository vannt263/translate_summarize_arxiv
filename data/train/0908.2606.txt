    "the current panoply of high - energy astronomical observatories is impressive : _ integral _ , _ swift _ , _ fermi - glast _ , _ rhessi _ , _ suzaku _ , and _",
    "agile_. these satellites have made fundamental contributions to their fields and in fact have had broad impact beyond their immediate purviews .",
    "these areas of study include @xmath0ray bursts ( _ swift _ , _ integral _ , _ fermi - glast _ ) , solar physics ( _ rhessi _ ) , supernovae ( _ swift _ ) , galactic astronomy ( _ integral _ , _ fermi - glast _ ) , galactic transients ( _ swift _ , _ suzaku _ ) , and agn ( _ suzaku _ ) .",
    "a basic consideration of the theory of photon interaction as a function of energy divides naturally into three regimes : photoelectric interactions at @xmath2 mev , compton scattering for @xmath3 mev , and pair production for @xmath4 mev ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this natural ordering has provided the impetus for three basic telescope designs , ( i ) coded aperture mask for low energies , in which the illumination of a non - redundant array grid casts a shadow on a detector , thereby giving a sky position ( e.g. , the bat on _ swift _ ) , ( ii ) a compton telescope for medium energies ( e.g. , comptel on _ cgro _ , and ( iii ) pair telescope in which an incident high - energy @xmath0ray interacts with a medium and produces a @xmath5 pair .",
    "the secondary phase consists of signal detection , which for the three cases is carried out by ( i ) scintillators ( e.g. , nai , bgo , csi , labr@xmath6 , and gso ) , ( ii ) solid state detectors ( e.g. , si , cdznte , ge , hgi@xmath7 ) , and ( iii ) pair trackers ( e.g. , spark chamber , si ) . figure 2 shows the history of @xmath0ray technology , with examples of observatories based on these 3 strategies .",
    "ray telescope technology.,height=308 ]",
    "the earliest astronomical spacecraft ( actually - unintentionally astronomical ) to utilize collimated detectors were the _ vela _ satellites ( klebesadel , strong , & olson 1973 ) .",
    "each carried six 10 @xmath8 csi scintillation counters distributed so as to achieve optimal nearly isotropic sensitivity .",
    "the detectors were sensitive in the energy range between @xmath9 and @xmath10 mev for _ vela 5 _ and @xmath11 mev for _ vela _ 6 , with a detector efficiency @xmath12 .",
    "the scintillators were shielded against direct penetration by electrons below @xmath13 mev and protons below @xmath14 mev . a high @xmath15shield ( i.e. , a shield to protect against nuclei with large atomic number ) attenuated photons with energies below that of the counting threshold .",
    "no active anti - coincidence shielding was provided .",
    "the accumulated data included a background component due to cosmic particles and their secondary effects .",
    "the observed background rate was @xmath16 c s@xmath17 for _ vela _ 5 and @xmath14 c s@xmath17 for _ vela _ 6 .",
    "_ heao - i _ ( 1977 - 1979 ) had gas - proportional counters , with each counter possessing a multigrid collimator ( wood et al 1984 ) .",
    "each collimator was composed of a stack of etched mo sheets interleaved with spacer frames . to maintain thermal stability",
    "a heat shield made of 2 @xmath18 m kimfol polycarbonate film and coated with 80 nm of al was put in front of each collimator .",
    "incident x - rays passed through the heat shield and mylar film , with the net transmission of the two layers determining the response to soft x - rays .",
    "collimation of @xmath0rays and background reduction for the osse instrument ( johnson et al .",
    "1993 ) aboard _ cgro _ ( 1991 - 2000 ) were achieved via active shielding and a passive w collimator .",
    "each of the four osse detectors consisted of a nai scintillation crystal shielded behind by an optically coupled 7.6 cm thick csi scintillation crystal in a `` phoswich '' ( phosphor sandwich ) configuration .",
    "each phoswich was enclosed in an annular shield of nai scintillation crystals providing anticoincidence for @xmath0ray interactions in the phoswich .",
    "the annular shield also enclosed a w slat collimator which sets the @xmath19 fwhm @xmath0ray fov of the phoswich detector .",
    "the bat instrument on _ swift _ ( 2004- ) has a d - shaped coded mask made of @xmath20 pb tiles ( @xmath21 mm ) mounted on a 5 cm thick composite honeycomb panel which is mounted by composite fiber struts 1 m above the detector plane ( gehrels et al .",
    "the bat coded mask uses a random 50% open/50% closed pattern rather than the more common uniformly redundant array pattern .",
    "the mask area is 2.7 m@xmath22 , which yields a half - coded fov of 1.4 sr .",
    "oso-3 ( 1967 - 1968 ) achieved the first extensive @xmath0ray observation in space , using a cerenkov scintillator detector ( badhwar , kaplon , & valentine 1974 ) , and showed the galactic disk to be a strong source of high - energy @xmath0rays .",
    "the detector consisted of 0.64 cm thick plastic scintillators and a 1 in thick lucite cerenkov radiator over a 0.16 cm thick pb sheet to convert @xmath0rays into @xmath23 pairs .",
    "the discriminator thresholds on all detectors were set using sea level muons .",
    "the energy threshold was 50 mev ( 1% ) , rising to 13.5% at 200 mev , and 17% at 1 gev , where the percentages indicate the fraction of the total geometric area .",
    "the false alarm rate for singly charged particles was about 0.15% .",
    "the @xmath0ray telescope flown on sas-2 ( 1972 - 1973 ) consisted of an assembly with 16 spark chamber modules above a set of four plastic scintillators , with another 16 modules below the scintillators ( fichtel , kniffen , & hartman 1973 ) .",
    "thin w plates ( which had a thickness of @xmath24 radiation lengths ) were interleaved between the spark chamber modules , with an area @xmath25 cm@xmath22 . the large number of w plates and spark chambers provided material for an incoming @xmath0ray to be converted into a @xmath23 pair , which could then be identified and used to provide a direction for the incoming @xmath0ray , and a way of determining the energy of the electrons in the pair by measuring the coulomb scattering .",
    "the sensitivity range of the instrument was about @xmath27 mev .",
    "after _ vela _ , cos - b ( 1975 - 1982 ) was the primary workhorse for studying @xmath0ray bursts ( boella et al .",
    "cos - b consisted of a dome - shaped 1.1m@xmath28 mm thick plastic scintillator viewed by nine photomultipliers for rejection of charged particles ( the anti - coincidence counter , or aco ) .",
    "the aco maximum sensitivity was at 700 kev .    the egret instrument ( kanbach et al . 1988 ) on _ cgro _ consisted of an anticoincidence system , a spark chamber with interspersed conversion material to materialize the incident photons and determine the trajectory of the secondary @xmath23 pair , a triggering device to detect the presence of charged particles with the correct direction , and an energy measuring device - a total - absorption spectrometer nai crystal .",
    "the 2-cm - thick plastic scintillators were viewed by 24 photomultiplier tubes coupled to the lower perimeter so as to keep the egret fov free of irregular mass distributions .",
    "the conversion of the incoming @xmath0rays into @xmath23 pairs occurred in an upper stack of 28 spark chambers interleaved with ta foils with an average thickness of 90 @xmath18 m ( @xmath29 radiation lengths ) . the total depth for on - axis radiation was hence about 0.54 radiation lengths , leading to a conversion efficiency of about 30% at 100 mev .",
    "the volume of the upper chamber was @xmath30 @xmath8 , so that an effective area @xmath31 cm@xmath22 resulted for the center of the fov .",
    "the lat ( atwood et al . 2009 ) on board _ fermi - glast _ ( 2008- ) is a pair conversion telescope with a precision converter - tracker and calorimeter , each consisting of a @xmath32 array of 16 modules supported by a low - mass al grid structure .",
    "a segmented anticoincidence detector covers the tracker array , and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system uses prompt signals from the tracker , calorimeter , and anticoincidence detector subsystems to form a trigger .",
    "the precision converter - tracker has 16 planes of high - z material in which @xmath0rays incident on the lat can convert to an @xmath23 pair .",
    "the converter planes are interleaved with position - sensitive detectors that record the passage of charged particles , thus measuring the tracks resulting from @xmath23 pair conversion .",
    "this information is used to reconstruct the directions of the incident @xmath0rays , each tracker module has 18 @xmath33 , @xmath34 tracking planes , consisting of two layers ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) of single - sided si strip detectors .",
    "the 16 planes at the top of the tracker are interleaved with high - z convert material ( w ) , i.e. , material capable of generating interactions with nuclei of high atomic number .",
    "the comptel instrument ( schnfelder 1991 ) on _ cgro _ combined a large fov with imaging .",
    "it consisted of two detector arrays , and upper one of low - z material and a lower one of high - z material .",
    "in the upper detector an incoming @xmath0ray was compton scattered , and the scattered photon subsequently made a second interaction in the lower detector .",
    "a time - of - flight measurement was utilized to confirm the causal relation .",
    "the locations and energy losses of both interactions were monitored .",
    "for events that were completely absorbed , the arrival direction of the @xmath0ray had to lie within a known angle of the direction of the scattered @xmath0ray , which allowed a determination of its original direction on the sky .",
    "incompletely absorbed events yielded uncertainty cones that did not constrain the source position .",
    "actual imaging of hard x - rays ( @xmath35 kev ) can be achieved using multilayer mirrors .",
    "the technology has been proven with the infoc@xmath18s balloon instrument , which obtained a 2.6 arcmin resolution image of 4u 0115 ( tueller et al 2005 ) .",
    "the pt / c reflector surface multilayer mirror had a diameter of 40 cm and a focal length of 8 m. the incident angle could lie in the range @xmath36 deg .",
    "there were 255 nestings and 2040 reflectors .",
    "the overall telescope had an effective area of 49 cm@xmath22 at 30 kev , an angular resolution of 2.4 arcmin ( half - power diameter ) , and a field of view of 11 arcmin .    currently under development",
    "is the _ nustar _",
    "instrument , a nasa smex mission slated for launch in @xmath37 which will contain an extensible boom for its multilayer mirrors , and cdznte detectors ( harrison et al .",
    "_ heft _ , a proof - of - concept balloon payload , contains three co - aligned conical - approximation wolter i mirrors , each of which focuses hard x - rays / soft @xmath0rays onto a shielded solid - state csznte focal plane .",
    "each of the three optics has 70 shells , with radii between 4 and 12 cm .",
    "the reflectors are coated with w / si multilayers , providing good reflectance up to the w k - edge at 69.5 kev .",
    "the total collecting area on - axis at 30 kev is 100 cm@xmath22 .",
    "_ nustar _ consists of three co - aligned telescope modules with a 10-m focal length , and the optics and detectors are placed at either end of an extensible mast .",
    "the optics consist of 130 shells each , with radii between 5.5 and 16.9 cm .",
    "the shells are coated with a combination of w / sic and pt / sic multilayers .",
    "combined with low graze angles , the smooth response goes up to 80 kev .",
    "_ nustar _ will achieve angular resolution of 40 arcsec ( half - power diameter ) .",
    "the _ nustar _ and _ heft _ focal plane detectors have the same dimensions , but the _ nustar _ detectors are surrounded by an active csi shield rather than graded - z / plastic shield .",
    "looking further into the future , new methods are being discussed that could in principle take advantage of the very short wavelength of @xmath0rays to achieve ultra - high resolution imaging .",
    "the diffraction - limited angular resolution @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lens diameter .",
    "this ultra - high resolution could be applied to directly image the event horizons of black holes .",
    "one technique for accomplishing direct , high - resolution imaging is through fresnel lenses ( skinner et al .",
    "fresnel zone plates ( fzps ) focus radiation by blocking with opaque annuli the photons contributing to spatial frequencies that would arrive at the image plane non - optimally .",
    "this technique is similar in spirit to `` apodization '' ( literally - `` reducing the feet '' - referring to the diffraction pattern ) used by optical astronomers in which a psf is enhanced by minimizing the higher order maxima of the diffraction pattern , effectively by throwing more of the light into the central , on - axis maximum .",
    "phase zone plates ( pzps ) go one step better by replacing the opaque annuli with media possessing a thickness of refractive material which imposes a phase shift of @xmath40 .",
    "the final step in improvement consists of phase fresnel lenses ( pfls ) in which the refractive material has a profile that is radial with respect to the central optical axis , so that all the radiation arrives at the focal point with exactly the correct phase .",
    "this is an exact analog of the optical astronomers apodization .",
    "the use of pfls for high - energy photons is achievable because all materials have a refractive index that differs from unity . for x - rays and @xmath0rays the refractive index @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a small positive number , leading to a @xmath18 value slightly less than unity .",
    "another possibility for direct imaging is through the use of laue concentrators ( von ballmoos et al .",
    "this method takes advantage of the phase information carried within the high - energy photons by using bragg diffraction , which refers to the interference between the periodic ( wave ) nature of light and the periodic structure of matter in a crystal lattice . in a laue diffraction lens",
    ", a large number of crystals are oriented in an annular configuration so that incident photons are imaged onto a common focal spot .",
    "the background noise is kept low because of the resultant small detector volume . in a laue - type crystal diffraction",
    "lens the crystals are positioned along concentric rings .",
    "in order to be diffracted the wavelength and incident angle of the incoming photon must obey the bragg relation @xmath43 where @xmath39 is the crystal plane spacing , @xmath44 the incident angle of the photon , @xmath45 the reflection order , and @xmath46 the photon wavelength .",
    "a crystal at a distance @xmath47 from the optical axis is oriented such that the angle between the incident beam and the crystalline planes is the bragg angle @xmath44 . for a given focal distance @xmath48 of the lens ,",

    "it was sensitive in the range @xmath55 mev and used wire ionization detectors .",
    "the astrophysical findings were upper limits ( perlow & kissinger 1951ab ) .",
    "the first @xmath0ray maps were made by _",
    "explorer-11 _ and _ oso-3_. the high - energy instruments on these satellites were of the cathode - ray type , and their design foreshadowed future directions in their use of converter , calorimeter , and plastic anticoincidence ( kraushaar , clark , & garmire 1968 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the first @xmath0ray map , a distribution characterized by a broad maximum toward the galactic center , and an isotropic component with a softer energy spectrum .",
    "the spark - chamber era , spanning 20 mev @xmath56 10 gev , was dominated by cos - b from 1975 to 1981 , and by egret on _ cgro _ from 1991 to 2000 .",
    "the current instrument continuing this thread is the lat on _ fermi - glast _ , with @xmath57 channels and 70 m@xmath22 of si surface .",
    "the galactic map obtained by egret has yielded a plethora of galactic sources and enriched our knowledge of their high - energy behavior .",
    "the third egret catalog ( figure 4 ) , which contains data from 1991 april 22 to 1995 october 3 , has 271 sources ( @xmath58 mev ) .",
    "the list includes a solar flare , the lmc , five pulsars , one probable radio galaxy detection ( cen a ) , 66 blazars , and 170 unidentified egret sources ( hartman et al .",
    "model predictions indicate that _",
    "fermi-_lat should be able to detect 9900 sources at @xmath59 in a one - year all - sky survey .",
    "early compton telescopes ( @xmath60 mev ) were flown on balloon programs at mpe in germany , and uc riverside and unh in the us .",
    "this unexplored energy range is technically challenging due to scattering , and localizations on the sky are typically to @xmath61 .",
    "a major advance was the comptel instrument on _ cgro _ which operated from 1991 to 2000 ( schnfelder et al .",
    "1993 ) . a new window to astronomy was hereby opened : comptel produced a reliable @xmath60 mev sky map , shown in figure 5 .",
    "( schnfelder et al .",
    "this was the first complete @xmath62 mev all - sky survey , which found 32 non - variable sources and 31 @xmath0ray bursters . among the continuum sources were pulsars that had spun down , stellar black - hole candidates , supernova remnants , interstellar clouds , agn , @xmath0ray bursters , and the sun during solar flares .",
    "line detections were also made : 1.809 mev ( @xmath1al ) , 1.157 mev ( @xmath63ti ) , 0.847 and 1.238 mev ( @xmath64co ) , 2.223 mev ( neutron capture ) .",
    "mev sky map.,height=221 ]    the history of grb research has been almost entirely written by high - energy , space - borne instruments .",
    "grbs were discovered as a phenomenon in 1967 by the _",
    "vela _ satellites ( klebesadel , strong , & olson 1973 ) , which were initially launched to verify the atmospheric nuclear test ban treaty . for many years",
    "grb research was strongly impeded by the fact that the distances to the sources were completely unknown .",
    "this began to change with the launch of _ cgro _ in 1991 and the use of batse and osse ( kurfess et al .",
    "1992 , 1997 ) . within a few months ,",
    "the uniform sky distribution of grbs made it clear that there was no concentration of sources to the galactic plane , and therefore grbs had to lie at either much smaller ( @xmath65solar system ) , or much larger ( @xmath65cosmological ) distances .",
    "the tradition of outstanding grb research begun by batse has been continued with the bat on _ swift _ , which is yielding @xmath66 arcmin localizations using a shadow mask design with cdznte detectors ( barthelmy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "one of _ swift _ s major successes has been the first position determination of a short grb ( gehrels et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the _ integral _ sky as seen by the ibis instrument has built upon the previous comptel results .",
    "an all - sky map was produced which represented the first complete scan of the entire central equatorial zone of the galactic plane at energies above 20 kev with a limiting sensitivity of @xmath67 mcrab . in the central radian ( bird et al .",
    "the resultant catalog also included a substantial coverage of extragalactic fields , and contained more than 200 high - energy sources .",
    "the mean position error for sources detected with significance above @xmath68 was @xmath69 arcsec , enough to identify most of them with a known x - ray counterpart ( bird et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this is important given the high galactic aborption inherent in most earlier surveys .",

    "gamma - ray astronomy has taken enormous strides in the last few decades .",
    "dramatic improvements in both spectral and imaging capabilities have thrust @xmath0ray telescopes into the forefront of astronomical research . for about a decade",
