    "linear transport in heterogeneous and random media emerges in several applications in nuclear reactor physics , ranging from the analysis of the effects of the grain size distribution in burnable poisons ( especially gadolinium ) and of pu agglomerates in mox fuel pellets , the quantification of water density variations in concrete structures and in the moderator fluid during operation ( e.g. , steam flow in bwrs ) or accidents ( e.g. , local boiling in pwrs ) , the assessment of the probability of a re - criticality accident in a reactor core after melt - down ( corium ) , or the investigation of neutron diffusion in pebble - bed reactors  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of applications of stochastic media is actually far reaching  @xcite , and concerns also inertial - confinement fusion  @xcite , light propagation through engineered optical materials  @xcite , atmospheric radiation transport  @xcite , tracer diffusion in biological tissues  @xcite , and radiation trapping in hot atomic vapours  @xcite , only to name a few .",
    "the stochastic nature of particle transport stems from the materials composing the traversed medium being randomly distributed according to some statistical law : thus , the total cross section , the scattering kernel and the source are in principle random fields . particle transport theory in random media is therefore aimed at providing a description of the ensemble - averaged angular particle flux @xmath0 and related functionals . for the sake of simplicity , in the following we will focus on mono - energetic transport in non - fissile media , in stationary ( i.e. , time - independent ) conditions .",
    "however , these hypotheses are not restrictive , as described in  @xcite .",
    "a widely adopted model of random media is the so - called binary stochastic mixing , where only two immiscible materials are present  @xcite . in principle",
    ", it is possible to formally write down a set of coupled linear boltzmann equations describing the evolution of the particle flux in each immiscible phase .",
    "nonetheless , it has been shown that these equations form generally speaking an infinite hierarchy ( exact solutions can be exceptionally found , such as for purely absorbing media ) , so that in most cases it is necessary to truncate the infinite set of equations with some appropriate closure formulas , depending on the underlying mixing statistics .",
    "perhaps the best - known of such closure formulas goes under the name of the levermore - pomraning model , initially developed for homogeneous markov mixing statistics  @xcite .",
    "several generalisations of this model have been later proposed , including higher - order closure schemes  @xcite . along the development of deterministic equations for the ensemble - averaged flux ,",
    "monte carlo methods have been also proposed , such as the celebrated chord length sampling  @xcite .",
    "the common feature of these approaches is that they allow a simpler , albeit approximate , treatment of transport in stochastic mixtures , which might be convenient in practical applications where a trade - off between computational time and precision is needed .    in order to assess the accuracy of the various approximate models it is therefore mandatory to compute reference solutions for linear transport in random media .",
    "such solutions can be obtained in the following way : first , a realization of the medium is sampled from the underlying mixing statistics ( a stochastic tessellation model ) ; then , the linear transport equations corresponding to this realization are solved by either deterministic or monte carlo methods , and the physical observables of interest are determined ; this procedure is repeated many times so as to create a sufficiently large collection of realizations , and ensemble averages are finally taken for the physical observables .    for this purpose , a number of benchmark problems for markov mixing have been proposed in the literature so far  @xcite . in a previous work  @xcite , we have revisited the benchmark problem originally proposed by adams , larsen and pomraning for transport in binary stochastic media with markov mixing  @xcite , and later extended in  @xcite . in particular , while these authors had exclusively considered @xmath1 slab or rod geometries , we have provided reference solutions obtained by monte carlo particle transport simulations through @xmath2 extruded and @xmath3 markov tessellations , and discussed the effects of dimension on the physical observables .    in this work",
    ", we further generalize these findings by probing the impact of the underlying mixing statistics on particle transport .",
    "the nature of the microscopic disorder is known to subtly affect the path of the travelling particles , so that the observables will eventually depend on the statistical laws describing the shape and the material compositions of the random media  @xcite .",
    "this is especially true in the presence of distributed absorbing traps  @xcite .",
    "we will consider three different stochastic @xmath3 tessellations and compute the ensemble - averaged reflection and transmission probabilities , as well as the particle flux .",
    "two distinct benchmark configurations will be considered , the former including purely scattering materials and voids , and the latter containing scattering and absorbing materials .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ section_models ] we will introduce the mixing statistics that we have chosen , namely homogeneous and isotropic poisson ( markov ) tessellations , poisson - voronoi tessellations , and poisson box tessellations , and we will show how the free parameters governing the mixing statistics can be chosen in order for the resulting stochastic media to be comparable . in sec .",
    "[ size_effects ] we will illustrate the statistical features of such tessellations , which is key to understanding the effects on particle transport . in sec .  [ transport_benchmark ] we will propose two benchmark problems , provide reference solutions by resorting to the tripoli-4 ^^ monte carlo code , and discuss how mixing statistics affects ensemble - averaged observables .",
    "conclusions will be finally drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce three mixing statistics leading to random media with distinct features .",
    "the subscript or superscript @xmath4 will denote the class of the stochastic mixing : @xmath5 for poisson tessellations , @xmath6 for voronoi tessellations , and @xmath7 for box tessellations .",
    "for each stochastic model , we describe the strategy for the construction of three - dimensional tessellations , spatially restricted to a cubic box of side @xmath8 . without loss of generality , we assume that the cubes are centered at the origin .",
    "markovian mixing is generated by resorting to isotropic poisson geometries , which form a prototype process of stochastic tessellations : a domain included in a @xmath9-dimensional space is partitioned by randomly generated @xmath10-dimensional hyper - planes drawn from an underlying poisson process  @xcite . in order to construct three - dimensional homogeneous and isotropic poisson tessellations restricted to a cubic box , we use an algorithm recently proposed for finite @xmath9-dimensional geometries  @xcite . for the sake of completeness , here we briefly recall the algorithm for the construction of these geometries ( further details are provided in  @xcite ) .",
    "we start by sampling a random number of hyper - planes @xmath11 from a poisson distribution of intensity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radius of the sphere circumscribed to the cube and @xmath14 is the ( arbitrary ) density of the tessellation , carrying the units of an inverse length .",
    "this normalization of the density @xmath14 corresponds to the convention used in  @xcite , and is such that @xmath14 yields the mean number of ( d-1)-hyperplanes intersected by an arbitrary segment of unit length .",
    "then , we generate the planes that will cut the cube . we choose a radius @xmath15 uniformly in the interval @xmath16 $ ] and then sample two additional parameters , namely , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , from two independent uniform distributions in the interval @xmath19 $ ] .",
