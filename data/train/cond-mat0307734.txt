    "these features agree well with the experimental observations in disordered solids .",
    "the lls bundles show ` zero ' critical strength as the bundle size goes to infinity in one dimension .",
    "it is not clear at this stage if , in higher dimensions , lls bundles are going to have non - zero critical strength@xcite . in any case , the associated dynamics of failure of these higher dimensional bundles with variable range load transfer@xcite should be interesting .",
    "we believe , the elegance and simplicity of the model , its common - sense appeal , the exact solubility of its critical behavior in the mean field ( els ) limit , its demonstrated universality , etc , would promote the model eventually to a level competing with the ising model of magnetic critical behavior .",
    "we are grateful to pratip bhattacharyya for useful discussions .",
    "one of the author ( bkc ) is grateful to the selected high - school leaving students ( in the undergraduate associateship programme of the saha institute of nuclear physics ) for their enthusiastic participation , comments and suggestions .",
    "their involvement and appreciation encouraged the comparative view of the usefulness of the model over the ising model discussed above .",

    "<S> this model also shows elastic - plastic like nonlinear deformation behavior when the fiber strength distribution has a lower cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> we solve analytically the fatigue - failure in a democratic bundle , and the behavior qualitatively agrees with the experimental observations . the strength of the local load sharing bundles is obtained numerically and compared with the existing results . </S>",
    "<S> finally we map the failure phenomena of fiber bundles in terms of magnetic model ( ising model ) which may resolve the ambiguity of studying the failure properties of fiber bundles in higher dimensions .    </S>",
