    "[ sec:2hdm ] ) and custodial symmetry ( in sec .",
    "[ sec : triplets ] ) .",
    "these two concepts are automatic features of the sm , and thus their important phenomenological consequences are best illustrated by comparison to models in which they are _ not _ automatic .",
    "a brief philosophical outlook is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , followed by a collection of homework questions in sec .",
    "[ sec : homework ] .",
    "let s start with a review of the gauge and fermion parts of the sm lagrangian .",
    "the sm gauge structure is su(3)@xmath3su(2)@xmath4u(1)@xmath5 , comprising respectively the strong interactions ( subscript @xmath6 for color ) , weak isospin ( subscript @xmath7 for the left - handed fermions it couples to ) , and hypercharge ( subscript @xmath8 for the hypercharge operator ) .",
    "the gauge boson dynamics are encoded in the lagrangian in terms of the field strength tensors : , so that @xmath9 for an on - shell particle . ]",
    "@xmath10 where repeated indices are always taken as summed . here",
    "the field strength tensors are given as follows .",
    "for the u(1)@xmath5 interaction , the field strength tensor takes the same form as in electromagnetism , @xmath11 for su(3)@xmath12 , and non - abelian theories in general , the field strength tensor takes a more complicated form , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the strong interaction coupling strength , @xmath15 run from 1 to 8 , and @xmath16 are the ( antisymmetric ) _ structure constants _ of su(3 ) , defined in terms of the group generators @xmath17 according to @xmath18 = i f^{abc } t^c.\\ ] ] for su(2 ) , @xmath15 run from 1 to 3 and @xmath19 , the totally antisymmetric three - index tensor defined so that @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the field strength tensor for su(2)@xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the weak interaction coupling strength .",
    "the gauge interactions of fermions or scalars are encoded in the _ covariant derivative _ , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coupling strength of the hypercharge interaction , @xmath8 is the hypercharge operator , and @xmath26 and @xmath17 are the su(2 ) and su(3 ) generators , respectively . when acting upon a doublet representation of su(2 ) , @xmath26 is just @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the pauli matrices , @xmath29    the corresponding gauge transformations can be written as follows ( for the su(2)@xmath21 and su(3)@xmath12 gauge field transformations , we give only the infinitesimal form ) : @xmath30 \\psi , \\qquad      b_{\\mu } \\to b_{\\mu } + \\frac{1}{g^{\\prime } } \\partial_{\\mu }",
    "\\lambda_y(x )      \\nonumber \\\\      { \\rm su(2)}_l : & \\quad &      \\psi \\to \\exp [ i \\lambda_l^a(x ) t^a ] \\psi , \\qquad      w^a_{\\mu } \\to w^a_{\\mu } + \\frac{1}{g } \\partial_{\\mu } \\lambda_l^a(x ) + \\epsilon^{abc } w^b_{\\mu } \\lambda_l^c(x )       \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\label{eq : gaugetransformations}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a mass term for a gauge boson would take the form @xmath31 this is _ not _ gauge invariant and thus can not be inserted by hand into the lagrangian .",
    "therefore , ( unbroken ) gauge invariance implies that gauge bosons are all massless .",
    "the sm contains three copies ( generations ) of a collection of _ chiral _ fermion fields with different gauge transformation properties under su(3)@xmath3su(2)@xmath4u(1)@xmath5 .",
    "the content of a single generation is given in table  [ tab : fermions ] , along with their hypercharge assignments .",
    "we will derive this relationship in sec .",
    "[ sec : higgsmech ] . ] ( the value of the quantum number @xmath8 ) and their su(3)@xmath12 ( color ) transformation properties .",
    "the fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 transform as doublets under su(2)@xmath21 , while the remaining fields transform as singlets .",
    ".the chiral fermion content of a single generation of the standard model . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     now we can work out the contributions of each scalar to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses . for the sm higgs doublet with @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    "so that @xmath36 we can write the doublet s contribution to the gauge boson masses - squared in _ matrix form _ in the basis @xmath37 : @xmath38 there are a couple of things to notice :    * the lower @xmath39 block is diagonalized by the weak mixing angle , @xmath40 this diagonalization gives the @xmath2 boson and ( massless ) photon eigenstates .",
    "* when @xmath41 ( equivalent to @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 and there is a `` rotation '' symmetry @xmath44 .",
    "this symmetry in the limit @xmath41 is the actual custodial su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "it is an accident in the sm ( as we ll see when we evaluate the same @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson mass - squared matrix for the triplets ) , and is only an approximate symmetry because it is broken by the gauging of hypercharge .",
    "now let s consider the real triplet with @xmath45 .",
    "its vev is @xmath46 so that @xmath47 because @xmath45 , the coefficients of the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 terms are zero ! the @xmath51 triplet s contribution to the gauge boson masses - squared in matrix form is given by @xmath52 in particular , the @xmath45 triplet contributes to the @xmath53 mass but does not contribute to the @xmath2 or photon masses .",
    "notice also that rotating the lower @xmath39 block by the weak mixing angle @xmath54 has no effect on this matrix .",
    "this means that when we add up all the contributions to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses - squared in matrix form , the contribution from @xmath55 will not change the value of the mixing angle @xmath54 between the @xmath2 and the photon : this mixing angle is in fact set entirely by the values of the gauge couplings @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "however , notice that in the @xmath41 limit , the @xmath51 triplet does _ not _ generate the same masses for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there is a symmetry @xmath56 , but no longer is there the full custodial su(2 ) symmetry @xmath44 .",
    "finally let s consider the complex triplet with @xmath57 .",
    "its vev is @xmath58 so that @xmath59 the @xmath60 triplet s contribution to the gauge boson masses - squared in matrix form is given by @xmath61 notice that the lower @xmath39 block of this matrix is still diagonalized by the same weak mixing angle @xmath54 as for the doublet .",
    "the photon is also still massless .",
    "however , as for the @xmath51 triplet , the @xmath60 triplet does not generate the same masses for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "again there is no custodial su(2 ) symmetry @xmath44 in that limit .",
    "the lack of custodial su(2 ) symmetry has a profound low - energy experimental consequence : it changes the relative strength of the charged and neutral weak currents . in the presence of the @xmath51 and @xmath60 triplets",
    ", we have @xmath62 so that @xmath63 the rho parameter is measured to be very close to one .",
    "this implies that , if one or both of the triplets that we ve discussed in this section are present , their vevs must either be very small compared to @xmath64 , or they must be _ tuned _ so that @xmath65 .",
    "tuning the triplet vevs to be equal in this way leads to a contribution to the gauge boson mass - squared matrix from the two triplets of @xmath66 this matrix has the same form as that for the doublet !",
    "the custodial su(2 ) symmetry is restored : in the limit @xmath41 , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses again become equal and we recover the rotation symmetry @xmath44 .",
    "the custodial symmetry can be better understood by studying the global symmetries of the sm higgs sector .",
    "we can think of the sm higgs doublet as an object with four real components , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi4component])i.e . , as a four - component vector .",
    "the higgs potential by itself ( not including the gauge interactions ) preserves a global o(4 ) symmetry , which is broken down to o(3 ) when one component of @xmath67 gets a vev .",
    "this is a larger symmetry than the gauged su(2)@xmath68u(1)@xmath5 ; in fact , the global o(4 ) corresponds to a global su(2)@xmath68su(2)@xmath69 symmetry , as can be seen by writing @xmath67 in the form of a _ bidoublet _ : @xmath70 which transforms under the global su(2)@xmath68su(2)@xmath69 symmetry as @xmath71 where @xmath28 are the pauli matrices as usual and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are constants . promoting this global symmetry to the local ( gauge ) symmetry of the sm , all three generators",
    "@xmath72 of the su(2)@xmath21 global symmetry become spacetime - dependent functions @xmath74 , but only the third generator @xmath75 of the su(2)@xmath69 global symmetry is gauged , becoming the @xmath76 generator of hypercharge . gauging only one component of a global symmetry violates the global symmetry .    in any case , when @xmath67 gets a vev , the bidoublet becomes @xmath77 which is proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "this breaks the global su(2)@xmath68su(2)@xmath69 symmetry down to the _ diagonal subgroup _ su(2)@xmath78 .",
    "this diagonal subgroup is the custodial su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "it is an accidental ( just a consequence of the ability to write @xmath67 as a bidoublet and have its vev automatically proportional to the unit matrix ) , approximate ( violated by hypercharge gauge interactions , as well as by the fact that the yukawa couplings of the up - type and down - type fermions are different ) global symmetry of the sm .",
    "we can take advantage of this observation to _ engineer _ the relationship @xmath79 between the triplet vevs by putting together the complex @xmath60 triplet and the real @xmath51 triplet into a @xmath80 object that transforms as a triplet under both the global su(2)@xmath21 and su(2)@xmath69 symmetries : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 . if the scalar potential is constructed to preserve the global su(2)@xmath68su(2)@xmath69 symmetry",
    "( this can be done by eliminating some terms in the most general gauge invariant scalar potential for two triplets and a doublet ; the resulting model is called the georgi - machacek model  @xcite ) , then it is natural for the triplets to get a vev of the form @xmath84 again proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "this preserves the same diagonal subgroup su(2)@xmath78 that is automatically preserved when the sm higgs doublet gets a vev .",
    "again , the symmetry is only approximate : one - loop corrections involving hypercharge gauge interactions regenerate the su(2)@xmath69-violating terms that were left out of the scalar potential ( but this is not so bad if the cutoff scale is not too far above the electroweak scale ) .    in this way , scalar triplets with a sizable vev can be added to the sm , allowing for some interesting beyond - the - sm higgs phenomenology .",
    "it has become a clich to say that the higgs boson discovery opens a new era in experimental particle physics .",
    "that is because it is true .",
    "detailed studies of the higgs boson s properties will dominate the lhc program over the next ten years , and form an important part of the physics case for the high - luminosity lhc upgrade to run in the next ten years after that .",
    "high - precision higgs studies are the primary motivation for the construction of the international linear collider .",
    "this experimental program will allow the higgs couplings to be measured with a precision reaching the sub - percent level , providing sensitivity to new physics affecting the higgs sector up to energy scales as high as a few tev .",
    "but the higgs is also a genuinely new beast from a theoretical point of view . if it is truly a fundamental scalar particle , it is the first one ever observed in nature .",
    "higgs boson decays to fermions , and higgs production via gluon fusion , represent the first observation of a collection of brand new interactions ( the yukawa couplings ) .",
    "the fact that the higgs is condensed in the vacuum  i.e .",
    ", that its vacuum expectation value is nonzero  implies the existence of a brand new quartic scalar interaction ( the higgs self - coupling ) .",
    "it is not an exaggeration to say that these are the first interactions ever observed by humans that are not a consequence of gravity or the gauge forces .",
    "the great triumphs of the standard model ",
    "qed , precision electroweak measurements , perturbative and nonperturbative ( lattice ) qcd , and the ckm framework for flavor physics ",
    "are all consequences of the gauge principle .",
    "this we understand .",
    "the great mysteries of the standard model  the origin of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson masses , the origin of the quark and lepton masses along with their mixing and cp violation , the origin of neutrino masses and their mixing , dark energy and inflation , and the hierarchy problems of the electroweak - breaking scale and the cosmological constant  all have something to do with what could be called the properties of the vacuum .",
    "the higgs is our first tangible piece of the vacuum , in that it is a quantum of the field that is condensed in the vacuum .",
    "it could teach us some of nature s deepest secrets .",
    "1 .   compute the tree - level decay partial width for the higgs boson into a pair of bottom quarks and show that it is given by @xmath85^{3/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the number of colours of the @xmath87 quark and @xmath88  gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the feynman rule for the @xmath89 vertex is @xmath90 .",
    "imagine that the scalar potential for the standard model higgs field contained a @xmath91 term , as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are all positive and @xmath96 has dimensions of mass .",
    "+ minimize the potential and eliminate @xmath93 in favor of the higgs vev @xmath97 . then find the higgs mass and the feynman rules for the @xmath98 and @xmath99 coupling vertices in terms of @xmath97 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95",
    "you can work in the unitarity gauge and write @xmath100 ( recall that when the @xmath95 term is not there , the higgs mass is @xmath101 , the @xmath98 coupling feynman rule is @xmath102 , and the @xmath99 coupling feynman rule is @xmath103 .",
    "the idea here is to see whether you can tell that the @xmath95 term is there by measuring @xmath104 and the @xmath98 coupling and comparing to the standard model relationship . )",
    "the lhc measures rates for higgs boson production and decay into specific final states , which can be written in the `` zero width approximation '' as @xmath105 if there is a new , non - sm decay mode of the higgs , which is unobservable at the lhc ( for example , higgs decay into light - quark jets , which would be buried under background ) , all the observable higgs signal rates can be kept the same by cranking up the production couplings at the same time as the branching ratio to the new final state is increased .",
    "all couplings must be increased by the same factor in order to keep the ratios of rates fixed ; we can denote that factor by @xmath106 , in which case @xmath107 and @xmath108 . + work out the relationship between the coupling scaling factor @xmath106 and the new unobservable decay branching ratio br@xmath109 that is required to keep all the higgs signal rates fixed to their sm values .",
    "( this relation defines a `` flat direction '' in the higgs coupling fit using lhc data . to cut off the flat direction , fits to lhc",
    "higgs data usually assume either that there are no unobservable new decay modes ( i.e. , br@xmath110 ) or that the higgs couplings to @xmath111 and @xmath112 can not be larger than their sm values ( i.e. , @xmath113 in our notation ) .",
    "the latter happens to be true in all models containing only higgs doublets and/or singlets of su(2)@xmath21 . )",
    "the correct ratio for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses can ( by coincidence ) also be generated by a septet ( or seven - plet ) of su(2)@xmath21 with hypercharge @xmath114 ( in the convention @xmath115 ) .",
    "if the vev of the septet is given by ( note that @xmath116 is in the neutral component , @xmath117 , so that @xmath118 ) @xmath119 work out the gauge boson mass - squared matrix in the @xmath120 basis and show that it is indeed proportional to the sm case , @xmath121 if the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses were generated entirely by the septet , what value of @xmath116 would be needed ? ( recall that @xmath122 and @xmath123 at tree level for @xmath124  gev . ) + could all mass generation in the standard model be accomplished by the septet ?",
    "why or why not ?",
