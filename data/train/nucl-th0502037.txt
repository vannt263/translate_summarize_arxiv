    ". these energies would be even larger if the range parameter @xmath110 taken in our 3nf model had had smaller and more realistic values .",

    "once this saturation point is reached , the resonance trajectory moves rapidly into the third quadrant .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ fig:3n_res_traj ] represent the @xmath114 resonance trajectories only partially , without following them to their final positions @xmath115 , i.e. when the additional interaction is completely removed .",
    "the reason is that these positions are very far from the bound state region , thus requiring many terms in pad expansion to ensure an accurate accc result . in principle",
    ", one could always imagine that these trajectories turn around and return to the fourth quadrant with positive real parts .",
    "although we have never encountered such a scenario in practical calculations , we are not aware of any rigorous mathematical proof forbiding it and it can not consequently be excluded .",
    "such a kind of evolution seems however very unlikely in a physical case of interest .",
    "the resonance trajectories should indeed exhibit a very sharp behavior once entered in the third quadrant whereas all our results indicate always a rather smooth variation .",
    "in this study we have deliberately omitted the use of realistic 3nf models .",
    "the reason is that such forces are not completely settled yet , specially for pure neutron matter .",
    "in addition , we should remark that the uix  @xcite 3nf acts repulsively for multineutron systems  @xcite .",
    "the more recent illinois 3nf contains charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) and considerably improves the underbinding problem of neutron rich nuclei present for av18+uix  @xcite .",
    "however , even strongly csb realistic 3nf would be by order too weak to make three - neutron system resonant .",
    "the reason of weak 3nf efficiency in multineutron physics is that such force requires configurations when all three neutrons are close to each other , whereas such structures are strongly suppressed by pauli principle .",
    "finally , one can expect that the different ways used to artificially generate bound states could give rise to different resonance trajectories .",
    "some resonance could thus have existed which are missed in our approach . to investigate such a possibility we have chosen a @xmath116 resonance , obtained by means of the phenomenological 3nf force ( [ yukawa_3nf ] ) with @xmath117 mev@xmath17fm .",
    "then we gradually reduce @xmath97 to zero , increasing at the same time the enhancement factor for the @xmath118 potential from @xmath119 to @xmath120 .",
    "the resonance trajectory obtained this way is plotted ( cross circles ) in figure  [ fig:3_2_nnn_identity ] together with the resonance curves obtained by additional 3nf only ( open circles ) and by enhancing only @xmath121 _ nn _ potential ( full circles ) .",
    "once 3nf was completely removed , the resonance pole joined the curve obtained with enhanced @xmath121 channel .",
    "note that the structure of bound state obtained with 3n force and by enhancing @xmath122-waves are quite different .",
    "3nf requires very dense and spherical symmetric neutron wave functions .",

    "a systematic study of three - neutron resonances using realistic _",
    "nn_-interaction models was presented .",
    "the search of resonance positions was carried out by artificially enhancing the interaction between the neutrons in such a way that the three - neutron system becomes bound .",
    "then , by gradually removing the additional interaction we followed the path of the resonance energy located in the third and fourth quadrants of the second riemann sheet .",
    "two different methods were successfully applied to trace resonance trajectories , namely the complex scaling ( cs ) and the analytical continuation in the coupling constant ( accc ) .",
    "they provided results in very good agreement .",
    "two alternative ways were also explored to enhance the interaction between neutrons : in one of them , the three - neutron system was bound by adding a phenomenological three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) and in the other one the binding was obtained by enhancing the interaction in some _ nn _ partial waves .",
    "all @xmath108 resonance trajectories , for states up to @xmath128 , were shown to move into the third energy quadrant ( re(e)@xmath129 ) becoming subthreshold resonances , well before the additional interaction is fully removed .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that the current realistic interactions exclude the possible existence of bound as well as resonant three - neutron states .",
    "to push the three - neutron resonance out of the subthreshold region , such models should already be strongly violated .",
    "these findings support the results of ref  @xcite for simplified _ nn_-interaction model .",
