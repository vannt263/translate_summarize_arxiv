    "the public relies heavily on mass media outlets for accessing important information on current events .",
    "given the intrinsic space and time constraints these outlets face , some filtering of events , stories and aspects to broadcast is unavoidable .",
    "the majority of media outlets claim to be balanced in their coverage , selecting issues purely based on their newsworthiness .",
    "however , journalism watchdogs and political think - tanks often accuse outlets of exhibiting systematic bias in the selection process , leaning either towards serving the interests of the owners and journalists or towards appeasing the preferences of their intended audience .",
    "this phenomenon , generally called media bias , has been extensively studied in political science , economics and communication literature ( for a survey see @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical accounts provide a taxonomy of media bias based on the level at which the selection takes place : e.g. , what issues and aspects are covered ( issue and facts bias ) , how facts are presented ( framing bias ) or how they are commented on ( ideological stand bias ) .",
    "importantly , the dimensions along which bias operates can be very diverse : although the most commonly discussed dimension aligns with political ideology ( e.g. , liberal vs. conservative bias ) other dimensions such as mainstream bias , corporate bias , power bias , and advertising bias are also important and perceived as inadequate journalism practices .        [",
    "cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     armed with a low - rank space which captures the predictable quoting behavior patterns of media , we attempt to interpret the latent dimensions and gain insights about these patterns .",
    "this low - rank space is given by the singular value decomposition ( svd ) : @xmath0 where the rows of @xmath1 ( respectively @xmath2 ) embed outlets ( respectively quotes ) in the latent space .",
    "we start by looking at the mapping of the labeled outlets , as listed in table [ tab : outlets ] , in the space spanned by the latent dimensions .",
    "figure [ fig : firstcomps ] shows that the first two latent dimensions cluster the outlets in interpretable ways .",
    "outlets with high values along the first axis appear to be more mainstream , while outlets with lower values more independent . along the second dimension , declared conservativeoutlets all have higher values than declared liberaloutlets .",
    "international news outlets such as the bbc and al jazeera have lower scores . going beyond our labeled outlets , we look in detail at the projection of news outlets along",
    "this dimension in table  [ tab : secondcomp ] , showing the outlets with the highest and the lowest dimension score , as well as outlets in the middle .",
    "a post - hoc investigation reveals that all the top outlets can be identified with the conservativeideology .",
    "furthermore , some of the highest ranked outlets on this dimension are self - declared conservativeoutlets that we did not consider in our manual categorization from table  [ tab : outlets ] , for example http://weaselzippers.us[weaselzippers.us ] , http://hotair.com[hotair.com ] and http://rightwingnews.com[rightwingnews.com ] .",
    "the region around zero , displayed in the second column of table [ tab : secondcomp ] , uncovers some self - declared liberaloutlets not considered before , such as http://democrats.com[democrats.com ] and president obama s own blog , http://barackobama.com[barackobama.com ] , as well as some outlets that are often accused of having a liberalslant , like http://cbsnews.com[cbsnews.com ] and http://latimes.com[latimes.com ] .",
    "finally , the outlets with the most negative scores around this dimension are all international media outlets . given that our framework is completely unsupervised , we find the alignment between the latent dimension and ideology to be surprisingly strong .",
    "# 1#2to # 1      so far we have seen that there are systematic differences in the quoting patterns of different types of media outlets . since all the quotes we consider are from the same speaker , any systematic linguistic differences that arise have the effect of portraying a different persona of the president by different types of news outlets .",
    "by choosing to selectively report certain kinds of quotes by obama , outlets are able to shape their audience s perception of how the president speaks and what issues he chooses to speak about .    to characterize the effect of this selection , we make use of the fact that the singular value decomposition of @xmath3 provides not only a way of mapping news outlets , but also presidential quotes to the aforementioned latent space . a selection of quotes that map to relevant areas of the space ( and that are cited at least five times )",
    "is shown in table  [ tab : quotes ] .",
    "the quote embedding allows us to perform a linguistic analysis of the presidential quotes and interpret the results in the latent bias space .",
    "even though the latent representation is learned in a completely language - agnostic way ( starting only from the outlet - quote graph ) , we find important language - related aspects .",
    "* sentiment .",
    "* we applied stanford s sentiment analyzer @xcite on the presidential speeches and explore the relationship between the latent dimensions and average sentiment of the paragraph surrounding the quote .",
    "we find a negative correlation between the second dimension and sentiment values : the quotes with high values along this dimension , roughly corresponding to outlets ideologically aligned as conservative , come from paragraphs with more negative sentiment ( spearman @xmath4 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sentiment ] shows how positive and negative sentiment is distributed along the first two latent dimensions .",
    "a diagonal effect is apparent , suggesting that outlets clustered in the international and independent region portray a more positive obama , while more mainstream and conservativeoutlets tend to reflect more negativity from the president s speeches .",
    "* negation .",
    "* we also study how the presence of lexical negation ( the word _ not _ and the contraction _ nt",
    "_ ) in a quote relates to the probability of media outlets from different regions of the latent bias space to cite that quote .",
    "while lexical negation is in some cases related to sentiment , it also corresponds to instances where the president contradicts or refutes a point , potentially relating to controversy .",
    "figure [ fig : negation ] shows the likelihood of quotes to contain negation in different areas of the latent space .",
    "the effect is similar : quotes with negation seem more likely in the region corresponding to mainstream conservativeoutlets , possibly because of highlighting the controversial aspects in the president s discourse .",
    "* topic analysis . *",
    "we train a topic model using latent dirichet allocation @xcite on all paragraphs from the presidential speeches .",
    "we manually label the topics and discard the ones related to the non - political `` background '' of the speeches , such as introducing other people and organizing question and answer sessions .",
    "we construct a topic  quote matrix @xmath5 such that @xmath6 if the paragraph surrounding quote @xmath7 in the original speech has topic @xmath8 as the dominant topic , and @xmath9 otherwise .",
    "we scale @xmath10 so that the rows ( topics ) sum to @xmath11 , obtaining @xmath12 , which we then project to the svd latent space introduced earlier by solving for @xmath13 in @xmath14 .",
    "since v is orthonormal , the projection is given by @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig : topics ] shows the arrangement of the dominant topics in the latent space . quotes about the troops and war veterans are ranked on the top of the second dimension , corresponding to more conservativeoutlets , while financial and healthcare quotes occupy the other end of the axis .",
    "healthcare is distanced from other topics on the first axis , suggesting it is a topic of greater interest to mainstream news outlets rather than the more focused , independent media .",
    "* lexical analysis . *",
    "we attempt to capture a finer - grained linguistic characterization of the space by looking at salient words and bigrams .",
    "we restrict our analysis to words and bigrams occurring in at least 100 and at most 1000 quotes .",
    "we construct a binary bag - of - words matrix @xmath16 where @xmath17 iff .  word or",
    "bigram @xmath8 occurs in quote @xmath7 .",
    "same as with topics , we scale the rows of @xmath16 ( corresponding to word frequency ) to obtain @xmath18 and project onto the svd latent space as @xmath19 . among the words that are projected highest on the first axis , we find _ republicans _ , _ cut _ , _ deficit _ and _",
    "spending_. among the center of the ranking we find words and phrases such as _ financial crisis _ , _ foreign oil _ , _ solar _ , _ small business _ , and",
    "_ bin laden_. the phrase _ chemical weapons _ also appears near the middle , possibly as an effect of liberaloutlets being critical of the decisions former bush administration . on the negative end of the spectrum ,",
    "corresponding to international outlets , we find words such as _ countries _ , _ international _ , _ relationship _ , _ alliance _ and country names such as _ iran _ , _ china _ , _ pakistan _ , and _ afghanistan_.    overall , the mapping of linguistic properties of the quotes in the latent bias space is surprisingly consistent , and suggest that outlets in different regions of this space consistently portray different presidential personae to their audience .",
    "* media bias . *",
    "our work relates to an extensive body of literature  spanning across political science , economics and communication studies  that gives theoretical and empirical accounts of media bias and its effects .",
    "we refer the reader to a recent comprehensive survey of media bias @xcite , and focus here on the studies that are most relevant to our approach",
    ".    * selection patterns . *",
    "several small - scale studies investigate subjects that media outlets select to cover by relying on hand annotated slant labels .",
    "for instance , by tracing the media coverage of 32 hand - picked scandal stories , it was shown that outlets with a conservativeslant are more likely to cover scandals involving liberalpoliticians , and vice - versa @xcite .",
    "another study @xcite focuses on the choices that five online news outlets make with respect to which stories to display in their top news section , and reports that conservativeoutlets show signs of partisan filtering .",
    "in contrast , by relying on an unsupervised methodology , our work explores selection patterns in data involving orders of magnitude more selector agents and items to be selected .",
    "closer to our approach are methods that show political polarization starting from linking patterns in blogs @xcite or from the structure of the retweet graph in twitter @xcite .",
    "these approaches operate on a predefined liberal - conservativedimension , and assume available political labels . furthermore",
    ", the structure they exploit does not directly apply to the setting of news media articles .",
    "* language and ideology .",
    "* recently , natural language processing techniques were applied to identify ideologies in a variety of large scale text collections , including congressional debates @xcite , presidential debates @xcite , academic papers @xcite , books @xcite , and twitter posts @xcite .",
    "all this work operates on a predefined dimension of conservative  liberalpolitical ideology using known slant labels ; in the news media domain slant is seldom declared or proven with certainty and thus we need to resort to an unsupervised methodology .",
    "* quote tracking . *",
    "recent work has focused quoting practices @xcite and on the task of efficiently tracking and matching quote snippets as they evolve , both over a set period of time @xcite , as well as over an longer , variable period of time @xcite .",
    "we adapt this task in order to news article quotes with presidential speech segments and build our outlet - to - quote graph .",
    "we propose an unsupervised framework for uncovering and characterizing media bias starting from quoting patterns .",
    "we apply this framework to a dataset of matched news articles and presidential speech transcripts , which we make publicly available together with an online visualization that can facilitate further exploration .",
    "there is systematic bias in the quoting patterns of different types of news sources .",
    "we find that the bias goes beyond simple newsworthiness and space limitation effects , and we objectively quantify this by showing our model to be predictive of quoting activity , without making any _ a priori _ assumptions regarding the dimension of bias and without requiring labeling of the news domains . when comparing the unsupervised model with self - declared political slants , we find that an important dimension of bias is roughly aligned with an ideology spectrum ranging from conservative , passing through liberal , to the international media outlets .    by selectively choosing to report certain types of quotes by the same speaker ,",
    "the media has the power to portray different personae of the speaker .",
    "thus , an audience only following one type of media may witness a presidential persona that is different from the one portrayed by other types of media or from what the president tries to project . by conducting a linguistic analysis on the latent dimensions revealed by our framework",
    ", we find that differences go beyond topic selection , and that mainstreamconservativeoutlets portray a persona that is characterized by negativism , both in terms of negative sentiment and in use of lexical negation .",
    "* future work . * throughout our analysis",
    ", we do nt take into account potential changes in a media outlet s behavior over time .",
    "modeling temporal effects could reveal idealogical shifts and differences in issue framing .",
    "furthermore , natural language techniques can be better tuned to insights from political science in order to produce tools and resources more suited for analyzing political discourse @xcite .",
    "for instance , exploratory analysis shows that state - of - the - art sentiment analysis tools fail to capture subtle nuances in political commentary and we expect that fine - grained opinion mining can achieve this better @xcite .",
    "finally , news sources often take the liberty of skipping or altering certain words when quoting .",
    "while these changes are often made to improve readability , we speculate that systematic patterns in such edits could uncover different dimensions of media bias .",
