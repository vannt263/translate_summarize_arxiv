    "ultracold neutral atoms in an optical lattice  @xcite are seen as an alternative to single - ions  @xcite for development of optical frequency standards .",
    "all best present realizations of the strontium optical clocks are made with fermionic strontium isotope @xmath6sr  @xcite , since the bosonic isotopes are expected to have larger collisional effects on the clock transition .",
    "additionally , the bosonic isotopes require at least one extra field to induce the clock transition , which implies careful control of this field and its respective field shift .",
    "on the other hand , the bosonic lattice clocks have some advantages over their fermionic counterpart : no first order zeeman shift , no vector or tensor lattice stark shifts and much higher isotopic abundance .",
    "lack of hyperfine structures in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 states and higher abundance reduce the time required for one lock cycle . furthermore , the set - up of cooling and trapping the bosonic isotope is simpler , which is important for transportable systems .",
    "the experimental difficulties in limiting and characterising the collisional shift in bosons are the reason why there are only two reported measurements of the @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 transition in @xmath1sr so far  @xcite . to calculate the recommended frequency values for the practical realizations of the metre ( mep ) and secondary representations of the second ( srs ) , the bipm takes into account the weighted average of independently obtained frequencies .",
    "a limited pool of available measurements forced the bimp to set practical relative uncertainties above the @xmath7 level when the @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 transition in @xmath1sr is used as mep and restrain in recommending this transition as srs  @xcite .",
    "there are two known ways to limit the effects of the collisions : the first , the measurements in the optical lattice trap with low atomic density and high confinement to suppress tunnelling effects @xcite ; the second , the use of higher dimensional optical lattice trap  @xcite . in our system",
    "the low value of collisional shift is ensured by a large waist of the lattice and trapping only a few atoms per lattice site in a trap .",
    "we report a system of two independent bosonic strontium optical lattice standards with @xmath1sr probed with a single shared ultranarrow laser .",
    "the absolute frequency of the clock transition is measured by the use of a frequency - doubled er : fibre polarization - mode - locked optical frequency comb referenced to the utc(aos ) and utc(pl ) @xcite via the 330  km - long stabilized fibre optic link of the optime network  @xcite .",
    "the experimental set - up of our system has been described in detail in ref.@xcite , so only its most essential elements are presented below .    ]    a simplified scheme of the system of two optical lattice clocks is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : general ] .",
    "two optical frequency standards ( sr1 and sr2 ) are based on the @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 transition in neutral @xmath1sr atoms .",
    "two clouds of cold atoms in sr1 and sr2 , trapped in the vertical optical lattices , are independently probed by an ultrastable laser with spectral width below 1  hz .",
    "the laser beam is split into two optical paths .",
    "the frequencies of both beams are independently digitally locked to the narrow atomic resonances in each standard by feedback to the acousto - optic frequency shifters .",
    "the short - time frequency reference of the optical standards , i.e. the ultrastable laser , is an extended cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) locked to the tem@xmath8 mode of the high - q cavity .",
    "the light from the ultrastable laser is transferred to the sr1 and sr2 standards and to the optical frequency comb through optical fibres .",
    "each fibre has a system of active doppler cancellation of the fibre - link noises to assure the transfer of stable optical frequencies @xcite .    in both sr1 and sr2 systems the fabry - perot diode lasers are injection - locked to the light from ultrastable laser .",
    "the master - slave system filters out any power fluctuations of the injection laser .",
    "the beam is passing the acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) of the digital lock and is injected to the optical lattice such that it is exactly superimposed with the lattice .",
    "the beam waist is much bigger than the size of the sample of atoms .",
    "the frequencies of the clock transitions can be compared by the use of an optical frequency comb with the utc(aos ) and utc(pl)@xcite via the optime network @xcite .    the 330  km - long time and frequency dissemination line between the space research centre at borowiec astrogeodynamic observatory ( aos ) and kl famo in toru",
    "is electronically stabilized with the elstab technology @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea of the elstab solution is to implement the compensation of the fibre delay fluctuations in the electronic domain , by using a pair of precisely matched variable delay lines .",
    "the delay lines are both placed in the forward and backward paths of the delay - locked - loop ( dll ) structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : elstab ] , left panel ) .    ]    the local module is installed at the aos in borowiec and the remote module is installed at the kl famo in toru .",
    "additionally , the line contains seven specialized optical bidirectional amplifiers based on erbium - doped fibres ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : elstab ] , right panel ) .",
    "thanks to bidirectional operation over the same optical path for the forward and backward directions , the propagation delay is constant for both directions .",
    "consequently , the possible phase fluctuations compensate and the insertion of the amplifier does not destroy the symmetry of the optical path .    to estimate the quality of the link , the pre - installation tests with a 300  km - long fiber on spools and bidirectional optical amplifiers were performed .",
    "the stability of the remote 10  mhz signal was measured with respect to the local input , using the a7-mx signal stability analyser .",
    "the overlapping allan deviation is equal to @xmath9 for 1  s integration period , and drops down to @xmath10 within 1  h ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bounce ] ) .    ]    the local representation of the coordinated universal time ( see e.g. @xcite ) at aos in borowiec , utc(aos ) , is realized directly in the form of a 1pps ( one - pulse - per - second ) by a system of an active h - maser ( ch1 - 75a ) and an offset generator ( symmetricom auxiliary output generator  aog ) .",
    "the active h - maser provides good stability over measurement times of up to a few days , with an allan deviation of @xmath11 at an averaging time of @xmath12  s and decreasing as @xmath13 up to the averaging time of @xmath14  s. the aog compensates the linear frequency drift of the maser on a daily basis and adds corrections in respect to the utc , extrapolated from differences utc- utc(aos ) and utcr - utc(aos ) published monthly and weekly , respectively , in circular - t @xcite .",
    "the details of the frequency chain at the aos are presented in fig.[fig : aos ] .    ]",
    "the difference between the corrections of the digital locks in the sr1 and sr2 standards yields the momentary frequency difference between the two clocks . the measured frequency stability in fractional units represented by the allan standard deviation is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : allan ] with two standards operating synchronously and asynchronously ( red and green lines , respectively ) .",
    "the short - time stability of the standards , up to 100  s of averaging , is limited by the quality of the ultrastable laser . the synchronous operation is mostly free from ultrastable laser fluctuations , except of small residual caused by independent setting of digital locks in the two standards .",
    "the measured stability of the synchronously operated clocks , with a clock cycle time of 1.32  s and interrogation time of 40  ms , reached @xmath15 after 10000  s of averaging .",
    "the two fundamental limitations of the optical clock stability , i.e. the quantum projection noise ( qpn ) limit@xcite for n = 32000 atoms of an individual clock and the dick effect limit@xcite , derived from the power spectral density of the ultrastable clock laser and the clock cycle time , are also depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : allan ] .     times the qpn limit for n = 32000 atoms of an individual clock , and the dick effect limit , derived from the power spectral density of the ultrastable clock laser for a clock cycle time of 1.32  s , are depicted by black and violet lines , respectively .",
    "[ fig : allan ] ]    the stability of the sr1 was also compared with the stability of the utc(aos ) maintained by the hydrogen maser in aos in borowiec .",
    "the comparison was made over the dedicated 330  km - long stabilized fibre optic link ( blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : allan ] ) .",
    "this measured frequency stability provides information about the overall statistical uncertainty of the reference frequency of the hydrogen maser , the stability of the fibre link , and of optical frequency comb .",
    "for example , the plateau at around 2000  s corresponds to the @xmath16c fluctuations of temperature in the room where part of the frequency chain at the aos in borowiec ( micro - stepper and frequency distribution amplifiers ) is placed .",
    "we have evaluated the main contributions to the frequency shifts in both sr1 and sr2 standards .",
    "the accuracy budgets are compared in table [ tab : acc ] for typical experimental conditions : applied b - fields inducing clock transition equal to 2.725 and 2.383 mt , clock laser intensities equal to 207 and 488 mw/@xmath17 and resultant rabi frequencies@xcite equal to 7.4 and 9.7 hz for sr1 and sr2 , respectively .",
    "most of the systematic contributions presented there were evaluated by making a series of several simultaneous ( interlaced ) locks to the atomic line with different values of particular physical parameter in one of the standard , with the other standard serving as a stable reference .",
    "examples of such evaluations are presented in fig .",

    "[ fig : shifts ] ]     the frequency stability ( within 1  mhz ) of the lattice 813  nm light was assured by narrowing and locking the lattice laser ( pre - tuned to the magic wavelength 368  554.58(28 )  ghz@xcite with accuracy of 200  mhz by a highfinesse ws6/200 wavemeter ) to the ultrastable 689  nm laser by a fabry - perot transfer cavity .",
    "the length of the transfer cavity , i.e. wavelength of the cavity modes , was controlled by a piezoelectric transducer and temperature of the cavity spacer . the lattice light shift and its uncertainty",
    "are evaluated by making a series of several interlaced locks corresponding to different lattice depths .",
    "different waists of the lattices in sr1 and sr2 ( 152 and 108  @xmath19 m , respectively ) and different depths of the lattices result in different values of measured residual light shift in sr1 and sr2 .",
    "the shift induced by the bbr can be described as a static shift with a small dynamic correction @xcite .",
    "the static contribution is proportional to the differential static polarisability of the two clock states @xcite and the mean square value of the electric field at temperature @xmath20 .",
