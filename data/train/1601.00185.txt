    "a quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocol is designed to allow two users alice @xmath1 and bob @xmath2 to establish a shared secret key that is secure against an all powerful adversary eve @xmath3 .",
    "typically , these protocols operate by @xmath1 preparing and sending qubits to @xmath2 who will then measure them ; both the preparation and the subsequent measurements are performed in a variety of bases as dictated by the protocol .",
    "this _ quantum communication stage _",
    "results in @xmath1 and @xmath2 each distilling a _ raw key _ : a string of classical bits of size @xmath4 which is partially correlated and partially secret .",
    "the users will then run an error correcting ( ec ) and privacy amplification ( pa ) protocol resulting in a secret key of size @xmath5 . in this paper , we are interested in the key rate in the asymptotic scenario defined @xmath6 .",
    "see @xcite for more information on these standard definitions and processes .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , assuming collective attacks ( where @xmath3 performs the same attack operation each iteration but is free to postpone the measurement of her ancilla to any future time ) , then @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the conditional von neumann entropy ; @xmath9 is the conditional classical entropy , and the infimum is over the set of all collective attacks which induce the observed statistics .    in this paper",
    ", we will compute a new lower bound on the key rate of a three - state protocol first introduced in @xcite .",
    "such a protocol allows @xmath1 to only send @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or @xmath12 ( we will actually consider a generalized version where the third state is @xmath13 for any @xmath14 ) ; thus the users can not measure the probability of @xmath3 s attack flipping a @xmath15 to a @xmath12 as can be done in the four - state bb84 @xcite protocol .",
    "however , by using mismatched measurement outcomes @xcite we can impose further restrictions on the set of possible attacks used by @xmath3 thus improving the key rate bound ( in particular , we will not discard , as is typically done , the measurement outcomes when @xmath1 and @xmath2 s choice of basis do not agree ) .",
    "our results show that , if we assume @xmath3 s attack is symmetric ( which could even be enforced ) , then the three state protocol s maximally tolerated error rate is equal to that of the four - state bb84",
    "protocol - i.e. , our key rate bound ( which will be a function only of parameters that may be observed by @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) remains positive up to an error rate of @xmath0 .",
    "we will also consider how the choice of @xmath16 affects this rate .    in @xcite ,",
    "mismatched measurement bases were also used to show this three - state protocol s key rate was equal to that of the full four - state bb84 . however , in this paper , we provide an alternative proof of this result using different methods .",
    "the technique we derive here may be easily extended to other qkd protocols .",
    "we also discuss the choice of @xmath17 .",
    "also , mismatched measurement outcomes were used in @xcite with the bb84 ( a four - state protocol ) and the six - state bb84 protocols ; it was also shown to produce a superior key rate for certain quantum channels , for those two protocols .",
    "in @xcite they were used to detect an attacker with greater probability for measure / resend attacks .",
    "we also used them in @xcite in the proof of security for a semi - quantum qkd protocol .    for notation ,",
    "we denote by @xmath18 to mean a density operator acting on the joint hilbert space @xmath19 . if we write @xmath20 then we mean the operator resulting from the tracing out of @xmath2 s subspace ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) .",
    "these definitions extend to three or more subspaces .",
    "by @xmath22 we mean the von neumann entropy @xmath23 and @xmath24 to mean @xmath25 .",
    "we use @xmath26 to denote the classical shannon entropy and @xmath27 to be the binary entropy function ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) .",
    "all logarithms in this paper are base two .",
    "the protocol we consider in this paper is a three state one and it is a generalization of the protocol described in @xcite . let @xmath29 be an arbitrary orthonormal basis and let @xmath30 , where @xmath13 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "clearly @xmath33 is also an orthonormal basis ; note that when @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is considered to be public knowledge .",
    "the quantum communication stage of the protocol consists of the following process :    1 .",
    "@xmath1 prepares a qubit of the form @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or @xmath16 , choosing each with probability @xmath38 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "this qubit is sent to @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath1 can not prepare @xmath40 .",
    "2 .   @xmath2 chooses with probability @xmath41 to measure the qubit in the @xmath29 basis ; otherwise , he measures in the @xmath30 basis .",
    "3 .   @xmath1 and @xmath2 will disclose their choice of basis ( using an authenticated classical channel ) . if their choice of basis is @xmath42 , they will use this iteration to contribute towards their raw key in the obvious way .",
    "note that , when @xmath34 , this protocol is exactly the three - state version of bb84 discussed in @xcite ; that is , it is bb84 with the limitation that @xmath1 can never send @xmath15 and thus the users can never measure the probability of @xmath3 s attack flipping a @xmath15 to a @xmath12 ( they can only measure the probability of a @xmath12 flipping to a @xmath15 ) . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "there are several potential practical benefits to this protocol .",
    "it is also interesting theoretically as it allows us to study the effects of decreasing @xmath1 s required quantum capabilities .",
    "to compute a lower bound on the key rate @xmath43 , we must first describe the quantum system after one iteration of the protocol , conditioning on the event this iteration is used to contribute towards the raw key ( in particular , @xmath1 sends a state from @xmath42 and @xmath2 measures in that same basis ) .",
    "we will first assume collective attacks ; later we will comment on general attacks .",
    "fix @xmath32 ; this parameter is public knowledge ( in particular @xmath3 also knows the value this is set to ) and furthermore , once fixed it is constant throughout the protocol .",
    "let @xmath44 be the unitary attack operator @xmath3 employs each iteration of the protocol .",
    "since we are conditioning on the event this iteration is used to contribute to the raw key , @xmath1 will prepare @xmath10 or @xmath11 , choosing each with probability @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath3 will then attack with operator @xmath44 . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume @xmath3 s ancilla is cleared to some",
    "@xmath46 state and so write @xmath44 s action on basis states as follows : @xmath47 these @xmath48 are arbitrary states in @xmath3 s ancilla and are not assumed to be normalized nor orthogonal .",
    "unitarity of @xmath44 of course imposes certain conditions on them ; furthermore , parameter estimation will yield even more data on them later .",
    "thus , the state of the quantum system , when the qubit arrives at @xmath2 s lab is : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the conjugate transpose of @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath2 will then measure in the @xmath42 basis ( again , we are conditioning on the event this iteration is used for the raw key ) yielding the final quantum state : @xmath53 call this state @xmath54 .",
    "we will make the usual assumption that the noise in the @xmath42 basis , induced by @xmath3 s attack , is symmetric : that is @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these parameters @xmath57 can obviously be estimated by @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; thus this symmetry condition can even be enforced .",
    "note that , without this assumption , our analysis could still be carried out , though the algebra is not as amiable .",
    "assume , for the moment , that @xmath58 ( we will consider the case @xmath59 later ) .",
    "tracing out @xmath2 , we may write @xmath54 as : @xmath60 where : @xmath61 it is obvious that both @xmath62 and @xmath63 are hermitian semi - definite operators of unit trace . before continuing , we require two lemmas which , though trivial to prove , we include for completeness :    [ lemma1 ] given a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath64 , let @xmath65 be an orthonormal basis of @xmath66 .",
    "consider the following density operator : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and each @xmath70 is a hermitian positive semi - definite operator of unit trace acting on @xmath71 .",
    "then : @xmath72    see @xcite for a proof .",
    "[ lemma2 ] given a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath73 and the following density operators : @xmath74 then the following is true : @xmath75    let @xmath66 be the two dimensional hilbert space spanned by orthonormal basis @xmath76 and let @xmath77 be the following density operator : @xmath78 which acts on @xmath79 . observe that @xmath80 .",
    "due to the strong sub additivity of von neumann entropy , it holds that : @xmath81 .",
    "we will show that : @xmath82 from which equation [ eq : thm1 - 1 ] will follow .",
    "of course @xmath83 .",
    "applying lemma [ lemma1 ] twice , we have : @xmath84    thus : @xmath85    thus , from lemma [ lemma2 ] , we may compute a lower bound on @xmath86 ( and thus a lower bound on the key rate @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is : @xmath87    we need now only compute the conditional entropy of the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 individually .",
    "it is clear that : @xmath88    now , tracing out @xmath1 , yields : @xmath89    we must now compute @xmath90 and @xmath91 . to do so , we will need the eigenvalues of these two density operators .",
    "first consider @xmath92 . without loss of generality",
    ", we may write : @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , we have the following : @xmath97 in this @xmath98 basis , we may write @xmath92 as : @xmath99 the eigenvalues of which are readily computed to be : @xmath100 using identities [ eq : basis - ident-1 ] and [ eq : basis - ident-2 ] , we have : @xmath101    similarly , we may compute the eigenvalues of the two - dimensional operator @xmath102 as : @xmath103 ( we are still assuming , for now , @xmath58 . )",
    "thus , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and so : @xmath106    it is trivial to show that @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the key rate of this three - state protocol is lower bounded by : @xmath108    note that , if @xmath109 , then @xmath110 and so these terms never show up in equation [ eq : final - state - chi ] . in this case , we may define @xmath111 arbitrarily and the above key rate bound will still hold .    therefore , to determine the key rate , @xmath1 and @xmath2 must estimate the quantities @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "these can not be directly observed ; however , by using the error rate in the @xmath33 basis , along with mismatched measurement results , they may determine bounds on these two quantities .",
    "before discussing how this is done , however , we mention one last critical detail .",
    "note that @xmath114 and @xmath111 are both greater than , or equal to , @xmath45 .",
    "note also that the binary entropy function @xmath27 attains its maximum when @xmath115 and on the interval @xmath116 $ ] it is a decreasing function .",
    "thus , if we find values @xmath117 and @xmath118 , such that @xmath119 and @xmath120 , then it will hold that @xmath121 ( and similarly for @xmath122 ) .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath123    we will soon see that it is easier to bound the real parts of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , we will define : @xmath126 ( the same discussion before concerning the case when @xmath59 applies ) .",
    "it is clear that : @xmath127 and similarly , @xmath128 . to evaluate our key rate bound in equation [ eq : keyrate - bound - final ]",
    ", we therefore need to determine bounds on the real part only of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .      to estimate @xmath129 and @xmath130",
    ", we will consider , first , the noise in the @xmath33 basis . to improve this bound",
    ", we will also consider measurement results from mismatched bases ( results which are typically discarded ) . before",
    ", continuing , let us introduce some notation .",
    "in particular , we will denote by @xmath131 to mean @xmath132 ( for @xmath133 .",
    "by @xmath134 we mean the probability that if @xmath1 sends @xmath135 ( for @xmath136 ) , then , after @xmath3 s attack , @xmath2 measures @xmath137 ( for @xmath138 ) . for instance , @xmath139 . finally , let @xmath140 ( and so @xmath141 ) .",
    "now , consider the quantity @xmath142 which , to avoid confusion with @xmath143 , we will also denote @xmath144 .",
    "this represents the error in the @xmath33 basis ( note that , unlike in a four - state protocol , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can not directly measure @xmath145 ) . by linearity of @xmath44 ,",
    "we have ( see equation [ eq : attack - op ] ) : @xmath146 thus : @xmath147    of course , @xmath17 ( and thus @xmath148 ) are public knowledge ; also the quantities @xmath57 can be estimated using the @xmath42-basis noise .",
    "that leaves : @xmath149 .",
    "most of these , however , may be estimated using mismatched measurement results .",
    "consider the quantity @xmath150 .",
    "this is a value that would ordinarily be discarded as @xmath1 and @xmath2 used different bases ; yet , this probability , which can be estimated by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , will lead to an estimate of @xmath151 . indeed : @xmath152 and so : @xmath153 on observing @xmath154 , along with @xmath150 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 immediately may estimate @xmath151 .",
    "similarly , they may use @xmath155 to estimate @xmath156 : @xmath157    when @xmath34 ( as dictated by the original three - state protocol @xcite ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 need not estimate @xmath158 and @xmath159 due to the fact that unitarity of @xmath44 ( which imposes the condition @xmath160 ) will force the terms to cancel in equation [ eq : pe - a - noise ] . for other values of @xmath17 , however , an estimate will be necessary and it may be accomplished by considering @xmath161 . from equation [ eq : pe - ua ]",
    "this is : @xmath162 since unitarity of @xmath44 forces the relation @xmath163 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 now have estimates of all quantities in equation [ eq : pe - a - noise ] except for @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "however , the cauchy - schwarz inequality forces @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "this , combined with equation [ eq : pe - a - noise ] , allow the users to bound @xmath164 and thus evaluate @xmath43 ( one must simply find the minimum @xmath43 over all @xmath166 $ ] ) . for our evaluations",
    ", we performed this optimization numerically ; however finding an analytic solution would be straight - forward .",
    "finally , as the protocol is permutation invariant , the results of @xcite apply and thus our key rate bound holds even against the most general of attacks ( not only collective ) .      ) with the one from @xcite ( which did not use mismatched measurement outcomes ) . ]    to evaluate our key rate bound , we will first consider the case that @xmath3 s attack is symmetric in that it may be modeled as a depolarization channel ( this is a common assumption in qkd protocol security proofs ; in fact , it could even be enforced by the users ) .",
    "consider a depolarization channel with parameter @xmath154 : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the two - dimensional identity operator .",
    "then , if @xmath1 sends @xmath169 , the probability of measuring @xmath170 is @xmath154 as desired .",
    "thus @xmath56 . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath1 sends @xmath10 , then the qubit s state when it arrives at @xmath2 s lab is : @xmath171 and so we have @xmath172 ( note that if @xmath34 and thus @xmath35 , we have @xmath173 as expected ) . using this value in equation [ eq : pe-01 ] yields : @xmath174 similarly , we find @xmath175 .",
    "if @xmath34 , we are done ; otherwise , we must consider @xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath1 sends @xmath16 , then the qubit arriving at @xmath2 s lab is : @xmath176 from which it is clear that @xmath177 . substituting into equation [ eq : pe-02 ]",
    "we find that @xmath178 .",
    "thus also @xmath179 .    substituting this into equation [ eq : pe - a - noise ] and solving for @xmath164 yields the expression : @xmath180 where , above , we used the fact that : @xmath181 .    finally ,",
    "from equation [ eq : eval - pw ] , we find @xmath182 and so : @xmath183 .",
    "note that , under this ( entirely enforceable ) assumption of a depolarization channel , the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath148 do not show up in the above expression ; they therefore do not appear in the evaluation of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , in this symmetric case , the value of @xmath17 is irrelevant ( at least in the perfect qubit , asymptotic scenario - we make no claims about its relevance in more practical scenarios ; it also is relevant in non - symmetric scenarios as we soon show ) .    to evaluate the key rate @xmath43 , we must now simply minimize @xmath43 over all @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "we performed this computation numerically , resulting in the key rate shown in figure [ fig : symmetric ] .",
    "notice that the key rate is positive for all @xmath184 ; this is exactly the tolerance supported by the four state bb84 protocol .",
    "compare this with the lower - bound from @xcite which did not make use of mismatched measurement bases and which only remained positive for @xmath185 .",
    "in fact , we found that , in this symmetric case , our new key rate bound agrees exactly with that of the four - state bb84 protocol @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the error in the @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) basis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this is true for any @xmath32 .",
    "this provides an alternative proof to the result from @xcite .    while @xmath17 does not appear when @xmath3 s attack is symmetric ; this of course is not true in other cases .",
    "we considered the effect of various settings for @xmath17 when @xmath190 ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) ) and @xmath191 ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ( b ) ) ; we also plotted the old key rate bound from @xcite for comparison . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) we considered the case when @xmath161 and @xmath155 are such that @xmath158 and @xmath156 are non - zero .",
    "as @xmath17 is a parameter that must be set before the protocol runs , it seems @xmath192 is a good compromise ( other settings can do better or worse depending on the attack used ) .",
    "we have derived a new proof of security and key - rate bound for a three state bb84 protocol - a protocol where @xmath1 sends only @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore we have shown that this new key rate bound , in addition to the use of mismatched measurement outcomes , can tolerate the same maximal noise level as the four state bb84 ( i.e. , the key rate is positive for all @xmath184 ) in the asymptotic scenario .",
    "the technique we used in our proof - especially our use of mismatched measurement outcomes in this manner to estimate @xmath131 despite the lack of the statistic @xmath193 - may hold application in the analysis of other qkd protocols where one ( or both ) party is limited .",
