    ", the vortex position data show some agreement between the simulations and the experimental data . due to the observation that the cores in the experimental toroidal trap data are likely to be found within a small region within the bec",
    ", we interpret our results as indicating that the observed cores are likely to have been pinned to the central barrier prior to expansion .",

    "thus for both experimental and simulated toroidal , this figure shows that the toroidal trap strongly influences the vortex core positions within the bec , and that cores are most likely to be found within a smaller region of the bec for the toroidal trap than for the harmonic trap .",

    ", we confirmed that residual center - of - mass motion of the bec ( once formed ) is minimal , with bec position varying by approximately @xmath732 @xmath7 m at most , and usually much less .",
    "this may be due to our procedure of evaporatively cooling directly in a final weak trap , rather than making a bec in a tighter trap and then relaxing to a weak trap ( larger residual center - of - mass oscillations may be observed when relaxing the trap after making a condensate ) .",
    "furthermore , our laser beam position is relatively stable with respect to the center of the harmonic potential throughout the course of a full data set , and fluctuates or drifts less than 4 @xmath7 m during an experimental run .",

    "2b in the main text and from supplementary table 1 it can be seen that there is some difference between the experimentally estimated probability of vortex observation compared to that from the simulations .",
    "in particular the simulation estimate is slightly higher than experiment for the sudden cooling of quench b , and slightly lower than experiment for the 6-s evaporative cooling of quenches a and c at the time of observation . due to the limited number of realisations of the experiment for these three runs , it is difficult to say whether this is real difference or due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "the theoretical modelling of the evaporative cooling is quite basic , and there is a strong possibility that this could affect the theoretical results in some manner .",
    "however , further simulations ( discussed below ) suggest that the simulations results are quite robust to the time scale of the quench of @xmath7 and @xmath24 .",
    "finally , we again note that the condensate growth curve was not measured experimentally for quench c , which shows the largest discrepancy in vortex statistics between theory and experiment .",

    "the description of defect formation in the kibble - zurek scenario is appealing due to its simplicity and universality .",
    "however , a somewhat more complete description for the quantum gas is the evolution from weak turbulence to a quasi - condensate and superfluid turbulence as described by svistunov and co - workers [ 9,18 - 21 ] .",

    "svistunov2000 ) . in this scenario , as the system cools ( but before condensation ) , the low - energy modes of the gas become highly occupied , and can be treated as classical waves .",
    "the superposition of a number of low - energy modes with large amplitudes and random phases ( as appropriate for a thermal distribution ) naturally gives zeros in the density of the gas via destructive interference , which can be considered as precursors to vorticity .",
    "a rapid quench leading to condensate formation can freeze these defects into the resulting superfluid , giving a tangle of vortices that then relaxes over a relatively long time scale . during this period of time ,",
    "the system is not in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the presence of vortices suppresses the establishment of long - range order , and the system is said to be in a _ quasi - condensate _ state .",
    "however , the thermodynamic state of the system that would be realised if the cooling proceeded more slowly is a condensate without vortices  it is the rapid dynamics of condensate growth that can trap defects in the superfluid .",
    "vortices are present in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose gas at cold temperatures ( but above any superfluid critical temperature ) for a similar reason  there is a superposition of highly occupied classical modes with random phases .",
    "this is why classical field models ( related to our theoretical techniques ) have had success in modelling berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) experiments in bose gases @xcite , see for example refs .",
    "simula2006a , simula2008a , bisset2008a .",
    "however , in a homogeneous system at least , the thermodynamic state of the system below the bkt superfluid temperature contains vortices that arise in bound pairs .",

    "@xcite for a recent discussion of vortices , superfluidity , condensation and long - range order in 2d trapped systems . because vortices and vortex dynamics are an important element of the bkt transition , our work on spontaneous vortex formation may at first appear somehow related to the bkt transition .",

    ", the thermodynamic state of a cold homogeneous 2d gas contains vortices ( either free or bound in pairs ) ; the bkt transition involves a transition from one equilibrium state ( with paired vortices ) to another equilibrium state ( with free and unbound vortices ) . in our work involving spontaneous vortex formation in a three - dimensional gas , vortices",
    "are seen because they are frozen into the evolving gas ( the quasi - condensate ) during a fast transition when the system is out of equilibrium .",

    "* here we provide a brief summary of our procedure to estimate the correlation length @xmath0 relevant for the bec phase transition of our experiments .",
    "this method follows the procedure outlined by anglin and zurek [ 8 ] . in the kz model ,",
    "a system undergoing a phase transition will fall out of thermal equilibrium when the equilibration ( or relaxation ) timescale @xmath77 exceeds the time remaining before the critical point is reached .",
    "this essentially means that the decreasing equilibration rates can not keep up with the cooling rate near the phase transition critical point . defining time @xmath69 as the time when the system reaches the critical point , the time @xmath78 is defined as the point at which the system falls out of equilibrium .",
    "the time @xmath79 can be estimated through the relationship @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the quench time ( @xmath3 is the quench rate as defined in our paper ) , and @xmath82 is the scattering time of atoms in the gas . for our data , @xmath83 s , and",

    "we estimate @xmath0 via the relation @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the thermal debroglie wavelength of the system at @xmath78 . for our parameters ,",

    "we have not performed any uncommon experimental techniques in order to observe spontaneously formed vortices .",
    "the bose gas of @xmath22rb atoms was evaporatively cooled in a similar manner to those of most other dilute - gas bec experiments [ 27 ] .",
    "one might assume that rapid cooling is necessary in order for distinct regions of coherence and hence spontaneous vortices to form , in contradiction with the seemingly long cooling time scales for quenches a and c. it is then natural to wonder why our experiments have yielded observations of spontaneous vortex formation during the bec phase transition given that this has not been reported previously .",
    "we believe that the major factors contributing to our observations are as follows :    1 .",
    "we evaporatively cool our gas to near - degeneracy in a tight trap , and then relax the trap to the final trapping frequencies before our final cooling ramp .",
    "this relaxation reduces the atomic collision rate at the point at which condensation occurs , and potentially decreases the ratio of the correlation length to the size of the ground state of the trap ( the harmonic oscillator length ) and thus increases the number of vortices expected to form . in the kz mechanism ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath0 depends on the quench time @xmath81 , so specific details of the ratio of correlation length to the harmonic oscillator length will depend upon specific cooling trajectories , as well as trap frequencies .",
    "regardless of the initial number of vortices formed , we expect that vortices may survive for longer times in weaker traps , where the lower atomic density and longer trap oscillation time scale generally decrease the rates of dynamical processes .",
    "our experiment is performed in an oblate trap with an approximately 2:1 aspect ratio , in which it is favourable for the vortices to align along the vertical symmetry axis of the trap @xcite .",
    "all analogous condensate formation dynamics experiments reported to - date in the literature have been performed in cigar - shaped traps @xcite .",
    "we introduce a linear magnetic field gradient during expansion that supports the condensate against gravity and allows for long expansion times before imaging . during ballistic expansion of the condensate ,",
    "the vortex cores expand relative to the condensate size such that our imaging system can optically resolve the cores .",
    "unless one is actively looking for vortex cores , such long expansion times ( 59 ms in our case ) are not necessarily needed or desired in other experiments .",
    "we have the ability to acquire images of trapped atoms along both the vertical axis ( the direction of strongest confinement ) as well as the horizontal axis , the more standard imaging axis for top trap experiments .",
    "the vertical imaging axis allows us to detect vortices that are well - aligned with the vertical trap axis .",
    "it seems entirely possible that spontaneous vortices have been present in other experiments , but simply could not be resolved , damped quickly , or were not sought . + * influence of the top field . *",
    "using the method of quadrupolar surface mode excitation and precession detection [ 31,32 ] , early experimental results from this work appeared to show a significant bias of the direction of fluid circulation for the observed spontaneously formed vortices .",
    "our initial measurements seemed to indicate that the direction of vortex fluid flow for the spontaneously formed vortices was most often found to be circulating in the same azimuthal direction as the rotating magnetic field that forms our top trap .",
    "this suggested that some form of stirring or other influence from the top trap was responsible for the apparent directional bias .",
    "however , our later and more detailed measurements on condensates created with quench a revealed that the apparent bias was a result of a scissors mode oscillation that was unintentionally excited .",
    "coupled with the times that we initially chose to stroboscopically probe the surface mode precession , the scissors mode oscillation appeared as a bias to the precession direction .",
    "such directional biasing is not detected in our more recent measurements using quench a , and we do not believe that the rotating field of the top trap plays a role in vortex formation ( these measurements were not performed with the toroidal trap data ) .",
    "furthermore , there is no observable difference in vortex observation statistics between data obtained with a 2 khz or with a 4 khz rotating bias field for the top trap ; if the field were somehow stirring the cloud , it is likely that a difference in vortex observation statistics for the two cases should be detectable due to different angular momentum coupling between the rotating magnetic field and the trapped atoms . + * relation to simulations of berloff and svistunov . * here we briefly compare the simulations of berloff and svistunov [ 22 ] to our own numerical calculations .",
    "the fact that our simulations are for the trapped gas rather than the homogeneous gas means that there are many quantitative differences compared to those of berloff and svistunov [ 22 ]  however the basic picture of strongly nonequilbrium dynamics resulting in a vortex tangle and superfluid turbulence before subsequent relaxation is the same .",
    "berloff and svistunov [ 22 ] simulated the transition from weak to superfluid turbulence in a homogenous bose gas using a discretised gross - pitaevsii equation on a large cubic grid of dimension @xmath92 .",
    "their initial condition was a superposition of plane waves according to @xmath93 where the phases of the complex amplitudes @xmath94 were randomly distributed as appropriate for the weakly - interacting bose gas in the kinetic regime [ 21 ] .",
    "the subsequent dynamics resulted in the redistribution of the mode occupation numbers leading to a growth in the low - momentum modes and the formation of a quasi - condensate while conserving energy and particle number .",
