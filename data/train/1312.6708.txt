    "one of the most important biological phenomena is a development of multi - cellular organisms from embryos with initially finite number of genetically identical cells .",
    "it is now well established that such spatial patterning and tissue formation is controlled by multiple signaling molecules that are called morphogens.@xcite these signaling molecules create non - uniform concentration profiles , which are also known as morphogen gradients , that serve as local dose - dependent gene regulators for embryo cells .",
    "depending on the concentration of morphogens different genes are turned on or turned off , producing morphologically different cells.@xcite the original ideas of reaction - diffusion control in biological development have been proposed by more than 60 years ago by a. turing,@xcite and in recent years a significant number of quantitative studies that uncovered important properties of morphogen gradients in various biological systems have been presented.@xcite however , our understanding of mechanisms of formation of signaling molecules profiles in embryos is still quite limited.@xcite    to explain complex processes that determine the establishment of morphogen gradients several ideas have been discussed.@xcite but the most popular proposed mechanism is based on a so - called synthesis - diffusion - degradation ( sdd ) model.@xcite it assumes that morphogen molecules are synthesized in some localized region of the embryo , then they diffuse along the cellular lines , and with some probability they can associate to receptors on cells surfaces , from which they are eventually degraded and removed from the system.@xcite this model has been widely used , although with a variable success , for analyzing dynamics of signaling molecules in different biological systems.@xcite    in most cases , theoretical analysis of the morphogen gradient formation employs one - dimensional continuum versions of the sdd model.@xcite a more realistic description of signaling processes that takes into account the structure of embryo requires the application of multi - dimensional models.@xcite the importance of dimensionality has been also pointed out in recent experiments on diffusion of morphogens in extracellular space where geometric obstacles strongly affect trajectories of signaling molecules.@xcite recently , the spherically - symmetric continuum sdd model has been investigated for multi - dimensional situations.@xcite this elegant theoretical method analyzed the kinetics of formation of morphogen gradients , and it also provided analytical expressions for stationary concentration profiles and for local accumulation times ( lat ) , which are defined as average times to reach locally the steady - state concentrations .",
    "one of the most surprising observations of this work is a prediction that for two - dimensional and three - dimensional systems , in contrast to one - dimensional models , there are multiple time scales for dynamics of formation of signaling molecules concentration profiles for the spatial region near the source.@xcite it suggested that the dimensionality might play an important role in dynamics of these reaction - diffusion processes .    analyzing the application of the results from continuum sdd models one has to remember that the continuum picture is an approximation which does not work for all set of parameters .",
    "the discrete - state stochastic version of the sdd model on semi - infinite interval has been recently introduced by one of us.@xcite the advantage of this approach is that it is valid for _ all _ ranges of the parameter space , and the continuum version is just a special limiting case .",
    "it has been also shown that the local accumulation times can be well approximated via the corresponding mean first - passage times , and the degradation process can be viewed as an effective potential that drives morphogens away from the source.@xcite    in this paper we develop a discrete - state stochastic framework for description of sdd models with strongly localized sources in all spatial dimensions . this analysis allows us to compute stationary - state density profiles for morphogens as well as transient dynamic properties such as local accumulations times , mean first - passage times and variance of the local accumulation times .",
    "it provides a direct way for measuring the effect of dimensionality in these reaction - diffusion processes . by comparing the obtained results with predictions from continuum models the role of discreteness",

    "the following arguments can be given to understand this behavior in the discrete sdd model .",
    "at @xmath26 the signaling molecules start at the origin , @xmath54 .",
    "the local accumulation time is the average time to reach the steady - state density at a given position , so it depends on possible pathways connecting the origin and any site at @xmath55 .",
    "increasing the dimensionality produces more pathways so it takes longer time if the diffusion is the rate limiting step . for this reason ,",
    "the lat depends on @xmath0 for diffusion rates comparable or smaller the degradation , while for @xmath7 there is no dependence on the dimension - the degradation is a rate - limiting step in this case . at sites close to the origin these diffusion pathways",

    "it has been argued before that in order to understand mechanisms of formation of morphogen gradients it is useful to consider mean first - passage times ( mfpt ) to reach specific locations for molecules starting from the origin.@xcite the reason for this is the fact that first - passage events are the dominating factors determining the local accumulation times at large distances , at least for one - dimensional systems,@xcite ; the explicit connections between these quantities have been recently studied for @xmath18.@xcite it is important to understand if first - passage processes describe the morphogen gradient formation in higher dimensions .    to compute mfpt",

    "these results again support the idea that main contribution to the lat at large distances from the origin are due to the mfpt , extending the validity of this idea to all dimensions .",
    "this is an important observation since the first - passage analysis is a well developed mathematical tool that was already successfully employed for analyzing multiple physical , chemical and biological processes.@xcite    to support arguments about the importance of the first - passage events in dynamics of the morphogen gradient development , the ratio of mfpt over lat is plotted in fig .",
    "7 for different sets of parameters .",
    "one can see that this ratio is always approaching 1 for large distances .",
    "larger degradation rates as well as higher dimensions lead to faster converging to unity , while in the continuum limit ( fast diffusion rates ) the effect of dimension disappears .",
    "analyzing mechanisms of morphogen gradient formation suggested a new idea that degradation can be viewed as an effective potential that drives the signaling molecules away from the source.@xcite thus morphogens are not simply diffusing with equal probability in each direction , but their motion is biased by this effective potential to move further away from the source .",
    "this concept can be extended and applied for the multi - dimensional sdd models of creating signaling molecules profiles .",
    "the effective potential can be easily calculated from the stationary profile , leading to @xmath68 and it can be rewritten as follows ( for @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 this equation has an important physical meaning suggesting that the overall potential is a sum of potentials along each of the coordinate axes .",
    "consequently , in higher dimensions the effective potential is stronger than one dimension .",
    "the reason for this is that in higher dimensions morphogens can diffuse in more directions and thus the probability of returning to the origin decreases as @xmath71 .",
    "it also suggests that there is a constant force component , @xmath72 along each axis that drives signaling molecules away from the source .",
    "the importance of this concept can be seen in explaining most dynamic properties of morphogen reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "the linear dependence of the lat on distances from the sources [ see eq .",
    "( [ accumulationtime2 ] ) ] is the consequence of the effective potential that changes the unbiased diffusion of morphogen molecules into a driven motion .",
    "similarly , the linear dependencies of the mfpt on distances have the origin : see eq.([mfpt_single ] ) .",
    "it also provides an alternative explanation for dependence of the lat on dimension for sites near the source ( fig .",

    "the same reasoning can be used to understand why the mfpt approximate the lat better at higher dimensions or at faster degradations ( fig .",

    "the importance of these observations is that they suggest possible ways of how nature might control noise in morphogen gradient systems .",
    "in the model discussed before it was assumed that the source of signaling molecules is sharply localized at the origin . in real systems",
    "the morphogen production is more delocalized,@xcite and it raises a question of how the size of the source region affects the dynamics of morphogen gradient formation . to answer this question ,",
