    "the later - time cosmic acceleration of our universe is strongly supported by observational data .",
    "namely observations of supernovae type ia@xcite , the data from baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao)@xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite measurements confirm that the universe is expending with an acceleration at the present time and about 70% of the energy density consists of dark energy in a wide sense@xcite , i.e. as the substance which is responsible for an anti - gravity force .    in the range with well  known @xmath3cdm model , which potentially provides correct description of the universe evolution but suffers from fine  tuning and coincidence problems , some alternative models were proposed .",
    "we will pay attention to the models with presence of scalar fields included in quintessence , phantom and quintom @xcite models .    a chiral cosmological model ( ccm ) as a nonlinear sigma model with a potential of ( self)interactions@xcite has been already used extensively in various areas of gravitation and cosmology@xcite and in particular for description of the very early universe@xcite and inflation@xcite .",
    "a ccm can be applicable as well to the late - time universe with dark matter and dark energy domination as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to put into use the two - component ccm as the model where the dark energy content of the universe and also the dark matter component are represented by two chiral fields with kinetic and potential interactions@xcite . by considering a target space metric in the form",
    "@xmath4 we prescribe a kinetic interaction between chiral fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 as a functional dependence @xmath0 on the fields .",
    "the potential interaction will be included into standard potential energy term of the action .",
    "there are no enough indications from observations about kinetic interactions between dark sector fields",
    ". therefore we always deal with the problem : what is the functional dependence for the chiral metric component on the fields ?",
    "first idea is to attract some results from hep , for example , to consider so(3 ) symmetry ( by taking @xmath7 ) and/or others symmetries for a chiral space .",
    "from the other hand one can use some testing kinetic interactions@xcite .",
    "thus we can state that there is no evidence for some preferable functional form of the kinetic interaction contained in the functional form of the @xmath0 chiral metric component . to avoid this problem",
    "we develop here the reconstruction procedure for the chiral metric component @xmath0 .",
    "we ascribe a certain desirable behavior on the kinetic energy of the second chiral field @xmath6 and it becomes possible to determine both the target space metric component @xmath0 and a ( self)interacting potential @xmath1 depending on the first chiral field @xmath8 .",
    "so we can restore a functional dependence the @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the scalar field @xmath8 using observational data .",
    "unfortunately it turns out that the procedure could not be applied for the entirely universe evolution and we have necessity to consider separately the early and late epochs of the universe evolution .",
    "it will be shown also that a ccm describes dark energy and dark matter in the unified form under special restrictions on the chiral fields ( ansatzs ) . therefore to include into consideration the present universe with accelerated expansion it needs to take into account baryonic matter and radiation in the range with a two - component ccm . making confrontation of proposed model predictions with observational data we found the way of a reconstruction of a kinetic interaction term @xmath0 and the potential @xmath1 in an exact form .",
    "this reconstruction is based on the procedure of finding the best  fit values matching to the astrophysical observations .",
    "the structure of the article is like follow . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the basic model equations and discuss their properties including the exact solutions for a pure ccm ( without matter and radiation ) .",
    "we derive the friedmann equation for the proposed model with the aim to make comparison with @xmath3cdm in section 3 . in section 4 , we give the details of a fitting procedure outline .",
    "we present the way of the reconstruction of the kinetic coupling and potential in section 4 .",
    "the early and recent universe approximations are discussed there as well .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the background dynamics of a ccm . finally in section 7",
    ", we discuss the obtained results and consider perspectives for the future investigations .",
    "recently we proposed a ccm coupling to a perfect fluid@xcite with the aim to investigate chiral fields interaction with cdm .",
    "for the sake of shortness we termed this model as @xmath9 to stress its difference from @xmath10 and others models .",
    "@xmath9 model presents a generalization of a single scalar field model coupled to cdm in the form of a perfect fluid@xcite .",
    "the model is described by the action functional    @xmath11    here @xmath12 stands for the perfect fluid part of the action , @xmath13 are the target space metric components depending on the scalar fields @xmath14 . the line element of a target ( chiral ) space is @xmath15 we use shortened notations for the partial derivatives with respect to the space - time coordinates : @xmath16 . as usual",
    "@xmath17 denotes a space - time metric as a function on the space - time coordinates , so greek indices @xmath18 vary in a range from 0 to 3 , latin capital letters @xmath19 , @xmath20  take values from 1 to @xmath21 where @xmath21 is evidently corresponding to the chiral fields number .",
    "the space - time of homogeneous and isotropic universe is described by a spatially - flat friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker ( frw ) metric @xmath22 the two - component ccm has a target space metric simplified to@xcite @xmath23 the @xmath24 ( [ 0 ] ) with internal space metric ( [ 7 ] ) includes the models proposed earlier : cold dark matter and cosmological constant ( @xmath3cdm , when @xmath25 ) model@xcite , quintessence model ( qcdm , when @xmath26 ) , phantom model ( phcdm , when @xmath27 ) , quintom model ( qcdm , when @xmath28 ) @xcite .",

    "when first inflationary models were analyzed it was much attention to a very simple case when an inflationary potential @xmath33 equals to the constant@xcite .",
    "moreover this regime is very important because it leads to an exponential expansion of the universe .",
    "note that a scalar field is equal to a constant value as well in this regime .",
    "let us consider for a minute the case of @xmath34 for the model under consideration ( [ 1eq])-([4eq ] ) .",
    "from ( [ 4eq ] ) one can obtain@xcite    @xmath35    combining ( [ 1eq ] ) and ( [ 2eq ] ) one can obtain the well - known solution of a de sitter universe with hubble parameter and scale factor@xcite @xmath36^{1/3}. \\ ] ] this solution with some approximation corresponds to the inflationary stage of the universe evolution .",
    "but our intention is to proceed further in time therefore we need to include into consideration radiation and matter to describe the present epoch of the universe .",
    "the method of the exact solutions construction for a ccm ( [ 1eq])-([4eq ] ) is based on exploiting an additional degree of freedom ( see , for ex .",
    "discussion in@xcite ) .",
    "namely even we fix the potential @xmath37 there are still four equations with four unknown functions @xmath38 ( @xmath39 can be set equal to @xmath40 without the loss of generality@xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless the equation ( [ 1eq ] ) can be obtained from the linear combination of the chiral field equations ( [ 3eq])-([4eq ] ) , so the equation ( [ 1eq ] ) does nt independent one .",
    "therefore one may insert the symmetry on the target space or can suggest a testing interaction between chiral ( dark sector ) fields@xcite . essentially new approach to this issue we propose here as a reconstruction both @xmath0 and @xmath1 from observational data .",
    "let us remind that for the scalar field cosmology by introducing the selfinteracting potential @xmath33 we have two equations with two unknown functions .",
    "( the same situation will be if we set the dependence a scalar field on time or if we know the scale factor of the universe as a function on time@xcite ) . to solve the system of a ccm interacting with a perfect fluid ( or matter ) in explicit form is a very difficult task .",
    "therefore we will use an additional freedom connecting with the chiral metric components @xmath39 and @xmath0 as a part of a kinetic energy .",
    "an interesting approach for a two - fields model with a cross interaction was proposed in the work@xcite . to describe a dark matter component",
    "it was constructed the special ansatzs for the time derivatives of the scalar fields . in our approach",
    "we will use instead some constraints on the kinetic parts of the chiral fields ( ansatzs ) to obtain a correct description of the present universe .",
    "now let us turn our attention to a study of the model equations ( [ 1eq])-([4eq ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check that the solution ( [ eq : chi_sol_h22 ] ) for the constant potential will be valid for the case when @xmath41 only . by extracting from ( [ eq : chi_sol_h22 ] ) the kinetic energy term for the field @xmath6 one can obtain @xmath42 we can ascribe by suggestion @xmath43 dust matter like behavior to the kinetic energy of the field @xmath44 . using the behavior",
    "@xmath43 it is easy to see that the second field can be related to the dark matter term provided the restriction to the kinetic energy of the second field @xmath44 ( ansatz ) @xmath45 let us mention here , that more simple ansatz @xmath46 has been analyzed in@xcite and gave possibility to obtain the exact solutions for the two - component ccm . for the kinetic energy of the first field",
    "@xmath5 we can form the ansatz by a simple way @xmath47 further we will show that this relation is associated with the dark energy component in the present universe .    for convenience let us represent the ansatzs ( [ anz - chi ] ) , ( [ anz - vp ] ) in the general forms :",
    "thus we have @xmath49 in ( [ eq : f_g_ansatz - f])-([eq : f_g_ansatz ] ) and the chiral metric component @xmath50    let us note that the suggested restrictions above give rise to the exact solution for the ccm describing by equations ( [ 1eq])-([4eq ] ) .",
    "indeed from ansatzs we can find the solutions for the chiral fields @xmath51 then from einstein equations ( [ 1eq])-([2eq ] ) we can define the potential @xmath52 the solution for the scale factor can be obtained from the equation    @xmath53    it is difficult to find the scale factor in exact view from this general equation , but for the special case assuming @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( under this assumption the second field @xmath6 becomes a constant ) , we found that the universe is in the stage with an exponential expansion with @xmath56 .",
    "our following task is to connect the energy densities of various species of the universe to the hubble parameter . to this end",
    "we need to include into friedmann equation ( [ 1eq ] ) the energy density of barion matter @xmath57 and radiation @xmath58 .",
