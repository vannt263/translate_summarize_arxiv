    "complex networks are known to play a key role in the description of the structure and evolution of different mesoscopic and macroscopic systems .",
    "indeed , the interacting parts of many natural and artificial systems can be interpreted as collections of linked nodes forming complex networks , whose structure and topology can be characterized in terms of statistical quantities such as their degree and path - length distributions , their connectivity , etc .",
    "empirical observations show that the mean distance between a pair of nodes within a connected real network is in general surprisingly short ( typically of a few degrees and only logarithmically dependent on the system size ) , a phenomenon known as _ small - world effect_. moreover , the neighborhood of each node is observed to be , on average , highly interconnected @xcite .",
    "the well - studied classical random graphs , which are networks built by linking nodes at random , display the small - world effect but have much lower connectivities than usually observed in real networks . in this context",
    ", the small - world networks were proposed few years ago @xcite as a realization of complex networks having short mean path - lengths ( and hence showing the small - world effect ) as well as large connectivities .",
    "starting from a regular lattice , a small - world network is built by randomly adding or rewiring a fraction @xmath2 of the initial number of links .",
    "even a small fraction of added or rewired links provides the shortcuts needed to produce the small - world effect , thus displaying a global behavior close to that of a random graph , while preserving locally the ordered , highly connected structure of a regular lattice .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that this small - world regime is reached for any given disorder probability @xmath3 , provided only that the system size @xmath4 is large enough ( i.e. @xmath5 , where the critical system size is @xmath6 ) @xcite .    as a further step , recent works investigated the behavior of many standard models of statistical mechanics defined on small - world networks ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as well as on other classes of complex networks @xcite .",
    "in particular , this was done for several equilibrium , ising - type spin models . besides their inherent theoretical interest",
    ", spin models defined on small - world networks can describe structural properties of polymer chains @xcite and have also been found useful in the study of social phenomena .",
    "for instance , spin states may denote different opinions or preferences , where the coupling constant describes the convincing power between interacting individuals , which is in competition with the `` free will '' given by the thermal noise @xcite .",
    "moreover , a magnetic field can be used to add a bias that could be interpreted as `` prejudice '' or `` stubbornness '' @xcite .    generally speaking",
    ", it was found that the structure and topology of the underlying complex networks affect dramatically the critical behavior of the models defined on them .",
    "for instance , it was found that the ising model defined on a 1d small - world network presents a second - order phase transition at a finite critical temperature @xmath7 for any value of the rewiring probability @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "considering directed links , even the nature of the phase transition was found to change , switching from second to first order @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition for the ising model on small - world networks has also been studied numerically by rewiring 2d and 3d regular lattices @xcite .",
    "much less attention , however , has been devoted so far to the investigation of nonequilibrium transitions on complex networks .",
    "some simple nonequilibrium models closely related to percolation were initially studied @xcite , while more recently a model for social interaction was investigated @xcite , in which the competition between dominance and spatial coexistence of different states in the nonequilibrium dynamics of potts - like models was examined . within the context of these recent developments ,",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the irreversible growth of binary mixtures on small - world networks .",
    "the growth of a binary mixture ( or , adopting an equivalent magnetic language , a two - state magnetic system of up and down spins ) can be studied by means of the so - called magnetic eden model ( mem ) @xcite , a natural generalization of the classical eden model @xcite in which the particles have an additional degree of freedom , the spin . in regular lattices",
    ", the mem s growth process leads to an eden - like self - affine growing interface and a fractal cluster structure in the bulk , and displays a rich variety of nonequilibrium phenomena , such as thermal order - disorder continuous phase transitions , spontaneous magnetization reversals , as well as morphological , wetting , and corner wetting transitions . while the eden model has extensively been applied to many different problems ( namely , soot formation @xcite , colloids @xcite , percolation @xcite , growth of cell colonies @xcite , crystal growth @xcite , etc ) , the mem describes the aggregation of particles with a magnetic moment and can provide useful insight into kinetic phenomena of great experimental and theoretical interest , such as the growth of metallic multilayers @xcite and thin films interacting with a substrate @xcite , fluid adsorption on wedges @xcite , filling of templates imprinted with nanometer / micrometer - sized features @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover , interpreting the spin of the particles in a more general way , it can represent different atomic species in a binary alloy , impurities or defects in a growing crystal , the states of bacteria cells like salmonella @xcite , the knowledge level of students in a classroom @xcite , etc .",
    "the mem growing on a small - world network could be considered , for instance , as representing the opinion spreading within a social group . according to the growth rules of the mem , which are given in the next section , the opinion or decision of an individual",
    "would be affected by those of their acquaintances , but opinion changes ( analogous to spin flips in an ising model ) would not occur . however , as mentioned above , other interpretations of the model could also be possible in contexts as different as materials science , sociology , and biology .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , details on the model definition and the simulation method are given ; section 3 is devoted to the presentation and discussion of the results , while the conclusions are finally stated in section 4 .",
    "in this work , we consider the one - dimensional , nearest - neighbor , adding - type small - world network model @xcite . starting with a ring of @xmath4 sites and @xmath4 bonds ,",
    "a network realization is built by adding new links connecting pairs of randomly chosen sites .",
    "for each bond in the original lattice , a shortcut is added with probability @xmath2 . during this process ,",
    "multiple connections between any pair of sites are avoided , as well as connections of a site to itself . since the original lattice bonds are not rewired , the resulting network remains always connected in a single component . on average ,",
    "@xmath8 shortcuts are added and the mean coordination number is @xmath9 . note that @xmath2 can also be regarded as the mean shortcut fraction relative to the number of fixed lattice bonds .",
    "once the network is created , a randomly chosen up or down spin is deposited on a random site . then , the growth takes place by adding , one by one , further spins to the immediate neighborhood ( the perimeter ) of the growing cluster , taking into account the corresponding interaction energies . by analogy to the ising model , the energy @xmath10 of a configuration of spins is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 indicates the orientation of the spin for each occupied site ( labeled by the subindex @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the ferromagnetic coupling constant between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spins , and @xmath15 indicates that the summation is taken over all pairs of occupied nn sites . as with other spin systems defined on complex networks , the magnetic interaction between any pair of spins is only present when a network bond connects their sites .    setting the boltzmann constant equal to unity ( @xmath16 ) and measuring the absolute temperature @xmath17 in units of @xmath18 , the probability for a new spin to be added to the ( already grown ) cluster is defined as proportional to the boltzmann factor exp@xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total energy change involved . at each step , all perimeter sites have to be considered and the probabilities of adding a new ( either up or down ) spin to each site must be evaluated . using the monte carlo simulation method ,",
    "all growth probabilities are first computed and normalized , and then the growing site and the orientation of the new spin are both determined by means of a pseudo - random number . although the configuration energy of a mem cluster , given by eq.([energy ] ) , resembles the ising hamiltonian , it should be noticed that the mem is a nonequilibrium model in which new spins are continuously added , while older spins remain frozen and are not allowed to flip .",
    "the growth process naturally stops after the deposition of @xmath4 particles , when the network becomes completely filled .    for any given set of defining parameters ( i.e. the network size @xmath4 , the shortcut - adding probability @xmath2 and the temperature @xmath17 ) , ensemble averages were calculated over @xmath21 different ( randomly generated ) networks , and considering typically @xmath22 different ( randomly chosen ) seeds for each network configuration . since all normalized growth probabilities have to be recalculated at each deposition step , the resulting update algorithm is rather slow .",
    "involving a considerable computational effort , this work presents extensive monte carlo simulations that cover the whole shortcut - adding probability range @xmath23 for different network sizes up to @xmath24 .",
    "the natural order parameter of a magnetic system is the total magnetization per site , i.e. @xmath25 which , in the context of this work , is to be measured on the completely filled network .",
    "however , since mem clusters are grown from randomly chosen seeds , the ensemble average of the total magnetization is @xmath26 . here",
    ", we will instead consider the absolute value of the total magnetization , @xmath27 , as the order parameter , which is also appropriate to avoid spurious effects arising from finite - size spontaneous magnetization reversals @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows plots of @xmath28 as a function of @xmath17 , for different values of @xmath2 and a fixed network size , @xmath29 .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath2 at a fixed temperature is that of increasing the net magnetization ( and , hence , the order ) of the system .",
    "indeed , larger shortcut fractions favor long - range ordering connections between distant clusters across the network . considering instead a fixed value of @xmath2",
    ", we see that , at low temperatures , the system grows ordered and the ( absolute ) magnetization is close to unity , while at higher temperatures the disorder sets on and the magnetization becomes reduced significantly .",
    "however , fluctuations due to the finite network size prevent the magnetization from becoming strictly zero above the critical temperature , and the transition between the low - temperature ordered phase and the high - temperature disordered one becomes smoothed and rounded .    strictly speaking , figure 1 is just showing evidence of pseudo - phase transitions , which might be precursors of true phase transitions taking place in the ( @xmath30 ) thermodynamic limit . in the following",
    ", we will proceed to characterize in more detail this pseudo - critical state , by measuring other observables on finite - size systems .",
    "further on , we will use standard finite - size scaling procedures to establish the phase diagram @xmath7 vs @xmath2 corresponding to the true phase transition in the thermodynamic limit , as well as to calculate critical exponents that describe the behavior of the system at criticality .    let us now consider the magnetic susceptibility @xmath31 , given by @xmath32 for equilibrium systems , the susceptibility is related to order parameter fluctuations by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "although the validity of a fluctuation - dissipation relation in the case of a nonequilibrium system is less evident , we will assume eq.([chimi ] ) to hold also for the mem .",
    "indeed , this definition of @xmath31 proves very useful for exploring the critical behavior of this system , as shown in earlier studies of the mem in regular lattices @xcite , as well as in other nonequilibrium spin models @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows plots of @xmath31 vs @xmath17 , for different values of @xmath2 and a fixed network size , @xmath29 . as with the thermal dependence of the order parameter shown in figure 1 , the order - disorder transitions signaled by the peaks of the susceptibility become rounded and shifted .",
    "for a given probability @xmath2 and system size @xmath4 , we will define the effective finite - size `` critical '' temperature @xmath33 as the temperature corresponding to the peak of the susceptibility .",
    "although the transition temperature of finite systems is not uniquely and precisely defined , the susceptibility peaks become sharper as one considers larger systems , and the effective finite - size `` critical '' temperatures tend to the true critical temperature in the ( infinite - size ) thermodynamic limit @xcite .    in the same vein",
    ", the heat capacity per site can be related to energy fluctuations as @xmath34 figure 3 shows plots of @xmath35 vs @xmath17 corresponding to the same parameter values used before .",
    "compared to the susceptibility , the heat capacity exhibits flatter shapes and broader peaks .",
    "further insight can be gained by examining the normalized probability distribution of the magnetization , @xmath36 . fixing the network size ( @xmath37 ) , the behavior of @xmath36 for different temperatures is shown in figure 4 for ( a ) the regular lattice and ( b ) the small - world network with shortcut - adding probability @xmath38 . for high temperatures , in both cases the probability distributions",
    "are gaussian - shaped and centered at @xmath39 , as expected for thermally disordered systems .",
    "however , their behavior is quite different at intermediate and low temperatures .    for @xmath1 ( see figure 4(a ) ) , the curvature of the distribution is convex and exhibits a local maximum always situated at @xmath39 , while other maxima develop at @xmath40 . at very low temperatures , the curved shape flattens and the maxima at @xmath40",
    "dominate the distribution .",
    "irrespective of the temperature , neither absolute nor local maxima arise at any intermediate values of the magnetization , i.e. different from @xmath39 ( the fully disordered state ) and @xmath40 ( the completely ordered states ) .",
    "in fact , this noncritical behavior is in agreement with previous results for the mem in the lattice : a cluster growing in a linear regular lattice from a single seed shows only a pseudo - phase transition with an effective `` critical '' temperature @xmath41 that vanishes in the ( @xmath30 ) thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "an analogous behavior was observed in the mem grown in a stripped ( 1 + 1)-dimensional rectangular geometry using linear seeds @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the small - world network ( see figure 4(b ) ) one observes the onset of two maxima located at @xmath42 @xmath43 , which become sharper and approach @xmath44 as @xmath17 is gradually decreased .",
    "the smooth shift of the distribution maxima across @xmath45 , from @xmath39 to the low - temperature nonzero spontaneous magnetization @xmath46 , is the signature of true thermally - driven continuous phase transitions @xcite .",
    "hence , critical behavior in the irreversible growth of mem clusters arises from the presence of shortcuts in the small - world network .",
    "this result is a nonequilibrium realization of analogous phenomena observed in related equilibrium systems , as e.g. the ising model in small - world networks generated from rewiring 1d lattices @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that this work focuses on nonequilibrium processes that can not be derived from the study of equilibrium systems .",
    "hence , the phenomena observed here provide further and independent evidence on the effects of long - range interactions on dynamical systems which are defined on small - world networks .    in order to explore further this phenomenon",
    ", we will extrapolate the finite - size `` critical '' temperatures to the thermodynamic limit and build the corresponding phase diagram , in which the critical temperature is given as a function of the shortcut - adding probability of the network .",
    "moreover , this procedure will also allow to determine the critical exponents of the system .    according to the finite - size scaling theory , developed for the treatment of finite - size effects at criticality and under equilibrium conditions @xcite ,",
    "the difference between the true @xmath47dependent critical temperature , @xmath48 , and the effective pseudo - critical one , @xmath33 , is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the exponent that characterizes the divergence of the correlation length at criticality .",
    "the symbols in figure 5 show the effective transition temperatures calculated for different network sizes in the range @xmath51 and different shortcut fractions , as indicated .",
    "recall that , as commented above , the size - dependent , pseudo - critical temperatures @xmath33 were determined for different system sizes and shortcut fractions from the maxima of the susceptibility ( see figure 2 ) . by means of least - squares fits of the finite - size scaling relation , eq.([scaling1 ] ) , to these data one can determine both the true critical temperature of the system , @xmath48 , as well as the critical exponent @xmath50 .",
    "the non - linear least - squares fitting procedure was implemented using the levenberg - marquardt minimization method @xcite",
    ".    the solid lines in figure 5 show least - squares fits to the data .",
    "indeed , the finite - size scaling theory proves useful in describing the behavior of this nonequilibrium system near the critical region , since the scaling relation given by eq.([scaling1 ] ) provides an excellent fit to all the data .",
    "figure 6 shows the phase diagram @xmath48 vs @xmath2 , corresponding to the critical behavior of the system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the error bars reflect the statistical errors , which were determined from the fitting procedure .",
    "as anticipated , for @xmath0 the system undergoes critical order - disorder phase transitions at finite critical temperatures : the small - world network geometry triggers criticality . naturally , the global ordering imposed by long - range shortcuts is weaker the lower the shortcut fraction , and hence @xmath48 decreases monotonically with @xmath2 .",
    "the critical temperature vanishes for @xmath1 , which is the expected regular lattice limit behavior .    as commented above , the same fits of eq.([scaling1 ] ) to the numerical data determine also the critical exponent @xmath50 .",
    "the obtained ( @xmath47independent ) value is @xmath52 , where the error bar reflects the statistical error resulting from the fitting procedure . as in the case of equilibrium spin systems defined on small - world networks ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the universality class of this nonequilibrium system is not observed to depend on the shortcut density , provided that @xmath0 .",
    "an additional characterization of the critical behavior of this system can be obtained by calculating the critical exponent @xmath53 , which describes the divergence of the susceptibility at the critical point .",
    "using again the finite - size scaling theory @xcite , the exponent ratio @xmath54 can be related to the peak of the susceptibility measured in finite samples of size @xmath4 by @xmath55 the symbols in figure 7 correspond to the maxima of @xmath31 plotted against the network size for different values of @xmath2 , as indicated , while the solid lines are fits to the data using this scaling relation , eq.([scaling2 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath56 , where the error bar reflects the statistical error from the fit . using this ratio and the value already obtained for @xmath50",
    ", we determine @xmath57 .",
    "binary mixtures growing irreversibly on small - world networks are studied numerically by means of extensive monte carlo simulations performed on the magnetic eden model .",
    "firstly , evidence for the occurrence of order - disorder pseudo - phase transitions is provided by the order parameter and the response functions of finite samples .",
    "then , studying the order parameter distribution functions , a clearly different behavior between the noncritical regular lattice ( @xmath1 ) and the small - world network ( @xmath0 ) is observed .",
    "indeed , the latter shows the behavior expected for systems undergoing thermally - driven continuous phase transitions .",
    "hence , it is concluded that a small fraction of shortcuts is sufficient to trigger criticality .    in order to obtain additional evidence of this phenomenon ,",
    "standard finite - size scaling relations are used to determine the phase diagram @xmath7 vs @xmath2 , in which the critical temperature is shown as a function of the shortcut - adding probability of the network .",
    "as expected , for @xmath0 the system undergoes order - disorder continuous phase transitions at finite critical temperatures .",
    "since the long - range ordering is weaker the lower the shortcut fraction , @xmath7 decreases monotonically with @xmath2 and vanishes for @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the system at criticality is further characterized by the calculation of the critical exponents @xmath52 and @xmath57 .",
    "these results , obtained in the framework of nonequilibrium growth systems , are a novel realization of analogous phenomena , which have recently been reported in the investigation of related equilibrium systems .",
    "indeed , they provide further and complementary evidence on the ordering and criticality - inducing effects of long - range interactions on dynamical systems defined on small - world networks . the present work will thus hopefully stimulate and contribute to further developments in the fields of complex networks and nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
