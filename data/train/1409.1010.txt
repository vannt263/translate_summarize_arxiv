    "in the outermost 30% of the solar radius , the transfer of energy towards the surface occurs via turbulent convection . to date",
    ", a comprehensive theory of solar turbulent convection from small up to global scales has not yet been formulated . in the last decades",
    ", mhd simulations have been extensively used to mimic the uppermost convection zone , as they match very well the observations of the solar photosphere . however , only tiny regions of the sun can be realistically simulated , because of the wide range of temporal and spatial convective scales and current computer power .",
    "a complementary approach to investigate the properties of convection on the solar quiet photosphere consists in the study of the interaction between convective flows and the small - scale magnetic fields ( hereafter magnetic elements ) in the interior of supergranular cells .",
    "these internetwork magnetic elements can be reasonably regarded as passive objects advected by the underlying flow , as the drag force due to plasma kinetic energy is greater than the magnetic force they exert on the surroundings . under this assumption ( discussed in sect .",
    "[ section : results ] ) , the dynamics of magnetic elements describes that of the plasma ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "tracking magnetic elements also allows us to study the onset and amplification of magnetic fields in the quiet sun , the scales on which they organize , and the rate of interaction between fields ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this information is important in order to get insights , for example , on the mechanisms that contribute to heating the solar corona , such as magnetic reconnections ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and buffeting induced mhd waves .",
    "previous studies have tracked g - band magnetic bright points and magnetic elements from magnetograms ( we refer to both of them as magnetic features ) , regarding them as lagrangian probes . under this assumption ,",
    "the mean square displacement of such single magnetic features , namely @xmath5 , has been measured and shown to follow a power law @xmath6 , where time @xmath7 is defined as starting from the first detection of the magnetic feature .",
    "in particular , a spectral index @xmath8 is associated with a normal diffusion ( also known as random walk ) with constant diffusivity @xmath9 . in this case",
    ", @xmath5 corresponds to the standard deviation of a gauss function describing the distribution of displacements .",
    "it is well known that the presence of the combined effects of the velocity field and a superposed diffusion can lead to a very large diffusive coefficient , the so - called eddy - diffusivity , which is the only relevant parameter needed to predict the long - time , long - space diffusion scale properties in many applied cases @xcite . on the other hand , when there is anomalous diffusion ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) the diffusivity depends on both spatial and temporal scales , and super - diffusive ( @xmath11 ) or sub - diffusive ( @xmath12 ) regimes can arise . the most recent works in the literature agreed that there was a super - diffusive regime in the quiet sun .",
    "this implies that the effective diffusivity decreases when the temporal ( spatial ) scale is reduced @xcite , thus allowing magnetic fields to be enhanced on the very short ( small ) scales .",
    "diffusive ( normal or anomalous ) regimes are typically well defined only in the asymptotic limit of large time and large distance , something that is very difficult to achieve in our case . in many geophysical and astrophysical situations",
    "only the transient behavior is observable and/or relevant , hence the interest in discussing in a more quantitative way the separation of pairs of magnetic elements in our observational set - up .",
    "while the diffusion of single lagrangian probes is dominated by large scale motions , pair separation should be more universal , being affected only by the relative velocity fields on scales on the order of the distance between the magnetic elements .",
    "if we identify with @xmath13 the distance between two magnetic elements in our ensemble at a given time @xmath7 , we will be interested in quantifying the probability distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath14 , of observing a given separation @xmath15 at time @xmath7 starting from an initial distance @xmath4 at time @xmath16 .",
    "in general , we obtain @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the velocity difference among the magnetic elements , the average is meant over all the considered pairs in our ensemble ( see sect .  [ section : observations ] ) and we have assumed that the initial position is uncorrelated from the underlying velocity field @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : diff1 ] is well behaved and in the limit of large time converges to @xmath19 , i.e. , we have asymptotically a normal diffusion process with diffusivity given by the one - point velocity fluctuations along the trajectories of the magnetic elements .",
    "nevertheless , there are many cases where this asymptotic regime is never reached , or it lies just outside the spatial and temporal limits of observation . for example , it is well known that in the presence of multi - scale non trivial statistical properties for the underlying velocity field , anomalous diffusion might develop .",
    "this is for instance the case of the celebrated richardson diffusion @xcite for homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows in the range of spatial scales where the velocity obeys a kolmogorov 1941 turbulent cascade @xcite . in this case",
    "it is predicted and observed the presence of a super - diffusion with @xmath20 and self - similar richardson - like pdf @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is known that in the presence of a spatially smooth velocity field with very long temporal correlation , there might be an anomalous ( super- or sub- ) diffusion ( see , e.g. , the pioneering works of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , there might also be the possibility of observing _",
    "strong _ anomalous diffusion , i.e. , a pdf for pair separation that is not self - similar @xcite , something that has been recently detected in turbulent flows using a very high - statistical dataset @xcite . in all cases , we are in the presence of a sort of strong or weak failure of the central limit theorem , i.e. , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : diff1 ] can not be trated as the sum of many uncorrelated variables , either because we are exploring spatial and temporal scales too small compared with the characteristic variations of the underlying velocity , or because the velocity field itself possesses non - trivial spatial and temporal asymptotic multi - scale properties .",
    "a _ local _ ( in temporal and spatial scale ) effective diffusion coefficient can be defined as @xmath21 which gives us the typical separation speed of two magnetic elements found at separation @xmath15 after a time @xmath7 and with initial separation @xmath4 .",
    "when the central limit theorem holds , we have @xmath22 , independently of the original separation @xmath4 .",
    "otherwise , different anomalous regimes arise . in particular , here we are interested in studying the effects of @xmath4 on pair separation for the case of magnetic elements in the quiet sun , where the observational and intrinsic physical limitations do not allow us to extend the observing regimes to couples with separations much larger than @xmath4 , and therefore where only the pre - asymptotic regime is observable .",
    "for instance , for fully developed turbulent flows , it is known that the pair separation is only ballistic , namely @xmath23 , up to a maximum time , the so - called batchelor time ( i.e. , @xmath24 , * ? ? ? * ) , wich depends on the initial separation and follows the law @xmath25 .",
    "to our knowledge , only @xcite and @xcite have applied pair dispersion analysis to magnetic features in the photosphere .",
    "@xcite tracked @xmath26 g - band bright point pairs acquired at the svst by observing a region @xmath27 wide for @xmath28 minutes , with a cadence of @xmath0 s and a spatial resolution of @xmath29 .",
    "they measured a spectral index consistent with @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite used nst images @xcite to track a maximum of @xmath31 magnetic bright points in a quiet sun region , a coronal hole , and a plage region .",
    "they measured a spectral index @xmath32 everywhere in the temporal range @xmath33 s. they interpreted this difference from known scaling as due to the imperfectly passive nature of bright points .",
    "the limitation in the statistics prevented the aforementioned authors from carrying out pair dispersion analysis taking into account the initial separation @xmath4 . in this work , for the first time",
    "the pair separation approach is used to investigate the dynamic behavior of magnetic elements in the quiet sun for different initial pair separations .",
    "we believe this is an important point , since it is difficult to imagine that pair separation is not affected by the initial condition for those temporal and spatial scales accessible on the sun .",
    "we present the results obtained with @xmath2 tracked magnetic pairs .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( 40,85 )    the data set used in this work was described in @xcite and analyzed by @xcite to study the diffusion of single magnetic elements up to supergranular scales .",
    "it consists of @xmath34 hinode - nfi magnetograms @xcite with a spatial resolution of @xmath1 and a noise of @xmath35 g for single frames .",
    "the magnetograms were co - aligned , trimmed to the same field of view ( fov , which is @xmath36 mm sized ) , and filtered out for oscillations at @xmath37 mhz @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the present analysis is free from effects of acoustic oscillations and atmospheric seeing , and aimed to magnetic elements and not magnetic proxies like g - band bright points .",
    "the large fov , which encloses an entire supergranule , and the high spatial resolution enabled us to investigate a wide range of spatial scales and observe a large number of magnetic elements .",
    "the series , acquired on november 2 , 2010 , covers 25 hours without interruption , with a cadence of @xmath38 s. this allowed us to study the dynamics of magnetic elements on a wide range of temporal scales ( from a minute to a day ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mag ] , we show the @xmath0 hr time - averaged magnetogram of the fov saturated at @xmath0 g. we focus on the region of interest ( roi ) inside the green circle , which is centered in the center of the supergranule and has a radius of @xmath39 mm , such that the roi is completely enclosed within the supergranule itself , i.e. , in the internetwork region @xcite .",
    "we applied the tracking algorithm described in .",
    "the algorithm uses a variable threshold in order to overcome the loss of weak fields and resolve the clustered peaks of the largest magnetic features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we discarded all the magnetic elements with speed @xmath40 kms@xmath41 , which is roughly the speed of sound in the photosphere .",
    "we also discarded the magnetic elements passing close to the boundary of the roi ( at a distance @xmath42 mm ) .",
    "a total of @xmath2 tracked magnetic pairs originated in the roi have been detected . in figure",
    "[ fig : mag ] we also show , for the sake of visualization , the evolution of a few magnetic elements forming a subset of pairs .",
    "the detected pairs have been used to investigate the nature of turbulent convection under the hypothesis of magnetic elements passively transported by the supergranular flows in the roi . by analyzing the same data set",
    ", @xcite found that the equipartition magnetic flux density is @xmath43 g. only less than @xmath44 of the total magnetic elements have an average flux greater than that value , and are all located in the network .",
    "therefore , the condition of passive magnetic elements is reasonably fulfilled in the internetwork regions , as demonstrated by the spectro - polarimetric studies performed by @xcite ; and @xcite .    as done in the previous works in the literature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the separation spectrum @xmath45 was first computed for all the pairs of magnetic elements , regardless of their initial separation .",
    "we obtained the results shown in figure [ fig : sepspectrum ] ( black diamonds ) .",
    "we found that the separation spectrum is best fitted by a power law @xmath46 with spectral index @xmath3 ( the red line in the same figure ) , in agreement with the results of @xcite , but here extended to supergranular scales . the error on @xmath47",
    "was computed as the standard deviation of the values obtained after a random subsampling of the magnetic pairs .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ section : intro ] , the high number of magnetic elements tracked allowed us to perform for the first time the pair separation analysis for different values of the initial pair separation . by looking in greater detail at the distribution of initial separations , one easily recognizes that it is in general very broad . in figure",
    "[ fig : initialsep ] we show , for each initial separation @xmath4 , the number of magnetic pairs found in the range @xmath48 mm , which is @xmath49 hinode - nfi pixels wide . vertical bars in the graph represent the errors , which are mainly due to the poissonian contribution .",
    "the peak of the curve lies between @xmath50 mm and @xmath51 mm ( @xmath52 ) . by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : sepspectrum ] and [ fig : initialsep ] one can see that the global mean displacement with respect to the initial separation , averaged over all pairs , is of the same order of magnitude as the spread in the initial distribution of @xmath4 in our sample , i.e. , we have not reached any asymptotic long - time regime .",
    "hence , it is natural to ask the question : how robust is the observed super - diffusive behavior as a function of @xmath4 ? as magnetic elements are not point - like , but have diameters up to @xmath53 mm , it is not possible to chose arbitrarily small mutual distances .",
    "therefore , the minimum pair separation set is @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , the maximum achievable separation is given by the diameter of the roi , which is @xmath55 mm .",
    "thus , @xmath4 must satisfy @xmath56 .",
    "we choose bins of @xmath4 large enough to collect a sufficiently high number of magnetic pairs within , and small enough to be able to study the variation of @xmath45 with @xmath4 . for this purpose",
    ", we set the bin size at @xmath57 km ( i.e. , @xmath49 hinode - nfi pixels ) , and computed @xmath58 for each bin . in figure",
    "[ fig : sepr0 ] we plot seven of all the computed @xmath58 . for comparison , we also over - plot the power law behavior @xmath59 ( corresponding to @xmath60 ) .",
    "in order to emphasize the deviations from such a law , in the inset of the same figure we plot a compensated pair separation spectrum @xmath61 .",
    "the errors on data points were computed as the standard deviation of the values obtained after a random subsampling of the magnetic pairs . from these two plots",
    "we can deduce that 1 ) the smaller the @xmath4 , the smaller the effective eddy diffusivity @xmath62 for any @xmath7 , and 2 ) the smaller the @xmath4 , the smaller the value of the _ effective _ slope @xmath47 ; in addition , there is a clear change in the trend for initial separation crossing the value @xmath63 mm , which roughly corresponds to the radius of the roi . from an observational point of view , 1 ) and 2 ) could be interpreted by taking into account the recent results in @xcite and @xcite . in those works , the authors showed that the horizontal velocity field within a supergranule is mostly radial and directed from the center to the boundaries . following this sketch",
    ", we expect that magnetic elements starting close to each other will , on average , separate more slowly than magnetic elements starting farther away from one another . in fact , magnetic elements with a larger initial separation are most likely to be dragged on along very different directions , thus separating faster .",
    "this effect naturally introduces a dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the systematic increase of the effective @xmath47 from the granular to the supergranular scale suggests that the pre - asymptotic diffusion is a function of the probed spatial scale . by comparing figures [ fig : initialsep ] and [ fig : sepr0 ]",
    "we note that for initial separations smaller than @xmath52 the slopes in the pair separation spectrum decrease at longer times ; while for larger initial separations the slopes increase .",
    "this trend is significant , as can be seen from the errors on the data points shown in the inset in figure [ fig : sepr0 ] .",
    "the pairs of magnetic elements with initial separation around @xmath52 ( from @xmath64 to @xmath65 mm ) , which are in number about half of the entire population of pairs , are characterized by a separation spectrum with @xmath47 around @xmath66 .",
    "this explains why in the separation spectrum in figure [ fig : sepspectrum ] , which was retrieved by considering all the pairs of magnetic elements in the roi ( with any initial separation ) , there is an effective trend consistent with @xmath67 even at longer temporal scales .    to further investigate the effects of @xmath4 on the pair separation , we computed the time - dependent pdf ( normalized at unit area ) of observing a given separation starting from the initial values of @xmath68 mm and @xmath69 mm , at which values the change in the trend shown in figure [ fig : sepr0 ]",
    "is observed .",
    "the results are shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ fig : pdfs ] . in that figure ,",
    "the initial separation range is depicted as a shaded area .",
    "as we can see , the pdf broadens with time , its rms being @xmath70 , and the peak moves to gradually increasing separations . at @xmath71 s the tails begin to be important , and affect substantially the pair separation spectrum , indicating that the largest separations begin to become dominant .",
    "we rescaled the time - dependent pdf so that it is centered at zero , and its rms @xmath70 is unity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to this end , we introduced the rescaled separation @xmath72 , being @xmath73 the mean separation value , and computed pdf(@xmath74 ) at each time .",
    "the correct re - normalization required to consider @xmath75pdf(q ) instead of pdf(q ) .",
    "the results are shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure [ fig : pdfs ] .",
    "as we can see , the curves seem to collapse on each other , especially in proximity of @xmath73 ( which corresponds to @xmath76 ) .",
    "this means that the small deviations from the mean values seem to be _ self - similar_. when it holds , self - similarity indicates that there is a single underlying distribution governing the process at any time @xcite .",
    "however , in our case the statistics is still too low to come to a conclusion in this sense .",
    "more data points are nedeed to better sample the tails of the time - dependent pdf , where any possible breaking of self - similarity can be detected .",
    "dynamic processes in the solar photosphere can be studied at spatial and temporal scales from granular to supergranular by measuring the pair separation rate of quiet sun magnetic elements . by taking advantage of uninterrupted @xmath0 hr magnetograms acquired by hinode at high resolution and imaging a whole supergranule , we computed the separation spectrum of @xmath2 pairs of magnetic elements .",
    "when considering all the pairs within the supergranule , we found a spectral index @xmath3 , in agreement with the most recent literature , but extended at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales .",
    "such a super - diffusive regime can be interpreted as being due to an underlying velocity field with either characteristic spatial ( temporal ) scales larger ( longer ) than the scales of observation ; or non - trivial asymptotic multi - scale properties .",
    "for the first time we investigated the separation spectrum for different values of the initial pair separation of magnetic elements , @xmath4 .",
    "the main conclusion is that the rate of pair separation depends on the spatial scale under consideration .",
    "the possibility that the pre - asymptotic diffusive behavior detected here possesses non - trivial multi - scaling properties remains to be investigated ; in other words , whether higher order moments do not scale proportionally to the second order moment , @xmath77 .",
    "this would indicate the presence of _ strong _ anomalous diffusion @xcite , possibly connected to the presence of intermittent properties of the advecting velocity field .",
    "this ambitious goal surely represents a great challenge for future research since it can only be achieved by extending by at least one order of magnitude the statistical ensemble and the temporal window of the observation .",
