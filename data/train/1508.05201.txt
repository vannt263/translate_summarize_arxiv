    "over the years many research works have been devoted on the issue of escaping or leaking particles from several types dynamical systems .",
    "in particular , the problem of escape is a classical problem in hamiltonian nonlinear systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) as well as in dynamical astronomy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , while escaping orbits in the classical restricted three - body problem ( rtbp ) is another typical example ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "nevertheless , the issue of escaping orbits in hamiltonian systems is by far less explored than the closely related problem of chaotic scattering @xcite . in this situation , a test particle coming from infinity approaches and then scatters off a complex potential . in a recently published paper",
    "@xcite we investigated the orbital dynamics in the copenhagen problem where one of the two primary bodied was a oblate spheroid . there",
    "the scattering region on the configuration @xmath2 space was a rectangular region extending around both primaries and we managed to classified initial conditions of orbits into different categories ( i.e. , orbits that crash into one of the primaries , escaping orbits and bounded orbits of several types ) . in the current work on the other hand ,",
    "the scattering region of initial conditions of orbits is confined only around the titan and especially between the lagrangian points @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "escaping and trapped motion of stars in stellar systems is an another issue of great importance . in a previous article @xcite",
    ", we explored the nature of orbits of stars in a galactic - type potential , which can be considered to describe local motion in the meridional @xmath3 plane near the central parts of an axially symmetric galaxy .",
    "it was observed , that apart from the trapped orbits there are two types of escaping orbits , those which escape fast and those which need to spend vast time intervals inside the equipotential surface before they find the exit and eventually escape .",
    "the escape dynamics and the dissolution process of a star cluster embedded in the tidal field of a parent galaxy was investigated in @xcite . conducting a thorough scanning of the available phase space the authors managed to obtain the basins of escape and the respective escape rates of the orbits , revealing that the higher escape times correspond to initial conditions of orbits near the fractal basin boundaries .",
    "the investigation was expanded into three dimensions in @xcite where we revealed the escape mechanism of three - dimensional orbits in a tidally limited star cluster .",
    "furthermore , @xcite explored the escape dynamics in the close vicinity of and within the critical area in a two - dimensional barred galaxy potential , identifying the escape basins both in the phase and the configuration space .",
    "the numerical approach of the above - mentioned papers served as the basis of this work .",
    "many times in the past the rtbp has played an essential role in several areas of celestial mechanics and dynamical astronomy .",
    "for instance , the modern applications to space flight missions @xcite are more numerous than the theoretical classical applications . moreover ,",
    "today many issues in space dynamics are of paramount importance and interest . the applications of rtbp include the launching of artificial satellites in the solar system and they also form the basis of several planetary theories .",
    "titan , saturn s largest moon , is undoubtedly a treasure trove of potential space discovery .",
    "having an environment which is comparable to that of the primordial earth and an atmosphere denser than that of any other moon in the solar system makes it a perfect candidate for space missions .",
    "in particular , the cassini - huygens mission s recent discovery of hydrocarbon lakes on the titan s surface @xcite has so inspired the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) that they plan to deploy a space mission to titan once more in roughly one decade from now . in the present contribution we shall explore the orbital dynamics of the saturn - titan system applying as a guide the numerical approach used in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) for the earth - moon system .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ dynmod ] we present in detail the properties of the dynamical model .",
    "all the fundamental concepts and the computational methods we used in order to determine the classification of the orbits are described in section [ cometh ] . in the following section , we conduct a thorough and systematic numerical investigation revealing the overall orbital structure of the saturn - titan planetary system .",
    "our paper ends with section [ disc ] where the discussion and the main conclusions of this work are given .",
    "let us briefly recall the basic properties of the planar circular restricted three  body problem ( pcrtbp ) @xcite .",
    "the two main bodies , called primaries @xmath4 and @xmath5 move on circular orbits around their common center of gravity . the third body ( test particle ) moves in the same plane under the gravitational field of the two primaries . it is assumed that the motion of the two primaries is not perturbed by the third body since the third body s mass is much smaller with respect to the masses of the two primaries .",
    "the non - dimensional masses of the two primaries are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass ratio and @xmath9 . for the saturn - titan ( st ) system , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we choose as a synodic barycenter reference frame a rotating coordinate system where the origin is at the center of mass of @xmath11 , while the centers @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the two primaries are located at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the total time - independent effective potential function in the rotating frame is @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 are the distances to the respective primaries and the angular velocity @xmath20 .",
    "the larger primary body @xmath4 ( saturn ) is an oblate spheroid @xcite and @xmath21 is the oblateness coefficient which is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the equatorial and polar radius , respectively of the oblate primary , while @xmath25 is the distance between the centers of the two primaries .",
    "according to table 1 of @xcite the oblateness coefficient for the saturn - titan system is @xmath26 .",
    "the study of oblateness includes the series of works of @xcite by considering the more massive primary as an oblate spheroid with its equatorial plane co - incident with the plane of motion of the primaries .",
    "the scaled equations of motion describing the motion of the third body in the corotating frame read @xcite @xmath27 the dynamical system ( [ eqmot ] ) admits the well know jacobi integral @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the velocities , while @xmath31 is the jacobi constant which is conserved and defines a three - dimensional invariant manifold in the total four - dimensional phase space .",
    "therefore , an orbit with a given value of it s energy integral is restricted in its motion to regions in which @xmath32 , while all other regions are forbidden to the third body .",
    "the energy value @xmath33 is related with the jacobi constant by @xmath34 .",
    "the pcrtbp with oblateness has five equilibria known as lagrangian points at which @xmath35 three of them , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath36 , are collinear points located in the @xmath37-axis , while the other two @xmath38 and @xmath39 are called triangular points and they are located in the vertices of an equilateral triangle .",
    "the central stationary point @xmath0 is a local minimum of the potential function @xmath40 , while the stationary points @xmath1 and @xmath36 are saddle point .",
    "@xmath0 is between the primaries , @xmath1 is at the right side of @xmath5 , while @xmath36 is at the left side of @xmath4 .",
    "the points @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the other hand , are local maxima of the potential function , enclosed by the banana - shaped isolines .",
    "the projection of the four - dimensional phase space onto the configuration ( or position ) space @xmath2 is called the hill s regions .",
    "the boundaries of these hill s regions are called zero velocity curves ( zvcs ) because they are the locus in the configuration @xmath2 space where the kinetic energy vanishes .",
    "the jacobi constant values at @xmath41 are denoted by @xmath42 . for the saturn - titan system",
    "we have : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . in fig . [ conts ]",
    "we see that the presence of forbidden regions in the pcrtbp permits the definition of four subsets of the configuration @xmath2 plane when @xmath47 : the interior region around titan ( white ) , the region around saturn ( green ) , the exterior region ( red ) , and the forbidden regions ( gray ) .",
    "for exploring the orbital dynamics in the saturn - titan system , we need to define samples of initial conditions of orbits whose properties will be identified . for this purpose",
    "we consider dense , uniform grids of @xmath48 initial conditions @xmath49 regularly distributed on the configuration @xmath2 plane inside the area allowed by the jacobi constant @xmath31 . following a typical approach ,",
    "all orbits are launched with initial conditions inside a certain region , called scattering region , which in our case is @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "for all orbits @xmath52 , while the value of @xmath53 is always obtained from the jacobi integral ( [ ham ] ) as @xmath54 .    in the pcrtbp system",
    "the configuration space extends to infinity thus making the identification of the type of motion of the third body for specific initial conditions a rather demanding task .",
    "depending on the jacobi constant the region around the titan can be connected or not to the saturn realm through the neck around @xmath0 or to the exterior realm through the neck around @xmath1 .",
    "therefore initial conditions of orbits around the titan can be categorized into basins , namely : ( i ) the bounded basin containing orbits which remain in the titan realm , ( ii ) the saturn realm basin constituted by orbits which escape through @xmath0 , ( iii ) the exterior realm basin corresponding to orbits that escape through @xmath1 , ( iv ) the collisional basin or orbits which collide with the titan .",
    "now we need to define appropriate numerical criteria for distinguishing between these four types of motion . in order to consider a more realistic approach",
    ", we assume that the titan is a finite body , taking into account its mean radius approximately by 2576 km ( about @xmath55 dimensionless length units ) . therefore",
    ", if an orbit reaches the surface of the titan , its numerical integration ends thus producing an orbit leaking in the configuration space .",
    "furthermore , an escaping orbit to the saturn realm must satisfy the conditions @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and the third body inside he circle around the saturn of radius @xmath58 . in the same vein , an escaping orbit to the exterior realm must fulfill the conditions @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , or @xmath61 , or , if @xmath56 , @xmath62 ( i.e. , the third body is outside the circle just defined ) . here",
    "we must clarify that the tolerances @xmath63 and @xmath64 were included in the escape criteria in an attempt to avoid that the unstable lyapunov orbits are incorrectly classified as escaping orbits .    in our numerical integrations the maximum time @xmath65 employed",
    "is 5000 dtu ( dimensionless time units ) , corresponding to about 64.315 yr .",
    "usually , the vast majority of orbits need considerable less time to escape from the system ( obviously , the numerical integration is effectively ended when an orbit moves outside the system s disk and escapes ) .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to use such a long integration time just to be sure that all orbits have enough time in order to escape .",
    "remember , that there are the so called  sticky orbits \" which behave as regular ones during long periods of time . here",
    "we should clarify , that orbits which do not escape or collide to titan after a numerical integration of @xmath66 dtu are considered as bounded regular orbits .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) for the initial conditions of all orbits are forwarded integrated using a double precision bulirsch - stoer ` fortran 77 ` algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite ) with a small time step of order of @xmath67 , which is sufficient enough for the desired accuracy of our computations . here",
    "we should emphasize , that our previous numerical experience suggests that the bulirsch - stoer integrator is both faster and more accurate than a double precision runge - kutta - fehlberg algorithm of order 7 with cash - karp coefficients . throughout all our computations , the jacobi integral ( eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) was conserved better than one part in @xmath68 , although for most orbits it was better than one part in @xmath69 . for collisional orbits where the test body moves inside a region of radius @xmath67 around the titan",
    "the lemaitre s global regularization method is applied .",
    "the value of the jacobi constant defines four different cases regarding the structure of the hill s regions . in particular",
    "* case i : @xmath70 all the transport channels around @xmath0 and @xmath1 are closed , so there is only the bounded and the collisional basins .",
    "* case ii : @xmath71 only the neck around @xmath0 is open .",
    "therefore , the saturn realm basin joins the two basins of the previous case .",
    "* case iii : @xmath72 both necks around @xmath0 and @xmath1 are open .",
    "now we have the exterior realm basin along with the three basins of the second case . * case iv : @xmath73 all four basins are present . in this case",
    "however , the forbidden regions are reduced @xmath74 or completely absent @xmath75 .      in fig .",
    "[ hr1 ] we present the basin diagrams for four values of the jacobi constant .",
    "the outermost black solid line is the zvc which is defined as @xmath76 . examining these diagrams we see that in case i there are only bounded and collisional orbits . in particular , for @xmath77 , that is an energy level very close to the titan s surface , all the available configuration space is covered entirely by initial conditions which correspond to collisional orbits .",
    "when @xmath78 two stability islands emerge inside the vast collisional basin .",
    "the smaller stability island , located on the left side of the titan , surrounds a periodic orbit around @xmath5 which is symmetric to a reflection over the @xmath37-axis @xmath79 and is traveled in counterclockwise sense , hence , prograde with respect to the rotating coordinate system .",
    "the larger stability island on the other hand , situated on the right side of the titan , surrounds a retrograde ( clockwise ) symmetric periodic orbit around @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite proved for the planar hill problem ( see also @xcite ) that the stability island on the left side of the titan is much more stable than that on the right side in relation to @xmath31 variation .",
    "as the value of the jacobi constant decreases we see in fig .",
    "[ hr1]c that for @xmath80 both stability islands grow in size . for the lowest value of @xmath31 , for instance @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "[ hr1]d ) , we observe that the size of the stability island located on the left side of the titan remains almost unperturbed , while the stability region on the right side considerably reduces .      when @xmath82 the neck around @xmath0 opens thus allowing an orbit to enter the saturn realm . indeed for @xmath83",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ hr2]a that there is an escape channel in the left side of the zvc .",
    "however , even though that the escape is possible we did not detected any initial conditions of orbits that escape through @xmath0 and therefore , the configuration plane is still composed of only bounded and collisional initial conditions .",
    "perhaps for such values of @xmath31 the width of the escape channel is too small , so all orbits collide to the titan s surface before they manage to escape .",
    "for @xmath84 the width of the escape channel doubles in size and one can observe the presence of thin filaments of escape basins around the stability island located in the right side of the titan .",
    "as the value of @xmath31 decreases the width of the escape channel increases thus allowing more and more orbits to escape to the saturn realm .",
    "apart from the increase to the escape basins we observe that the stability island in the right side of the titan reduces in size . at the lowest value of the jacobi constant in case",
    "ii , that is @xmath85 , we identify in fig . [ hr2]d well defined escape basins inside the vast collisional basin , while on the right side of the diagram , only a minor bounded basin is present .    here",
    "it should be emphasized that the numerical integration is stopped as soon as the third body passes @xmath0 thus entering the saturn realm .",
    "however , if we do not stop the numerical integration some orbits that initially entered the saturn realm may return to the titan region , or crash into on of the primary bodies , or even enter the exterior region and then escape to infinity . in our calculations",
    "we follow the approach used in @xcite and we consider an orbit to escape to saturn realm if the test body passes @xmath0 even if its true asymptotic behaviour at very long time limit is different .",
    "this case constitutes the hill s regions with the most interest in point of view of planetary systems .",
    "furthermore , it has many practical applications , such as orbit determination of spacecraft mainly based on many - models and also the phenomenon of temporary capture of comets or asteroids around planets in our solar system .",
    "the exterior realm rises when @xmath86 . in fig .",
    "[ hr3]a we see that for @xmath87 both necks around @xmath0 and @xmath1 are open .",

    "in particular we see in fig .",
    "[ hr3]e that when @xmath89 about 45% of the available configuration plane is occupied by initial conditions of orbits that escape through @xmath1 to the exterior region .",
    "finally when @xmath90 it is evident that the exterior realm basin take over the configuration plane , leading to the predominance of this type of orbits at the end of case iii .",
    "moreover , the extent of the collisional and the saturn realm basins is considerably reduced , while a small stability island in the left side of the titan survives .      in this last case , there are two subintervals delimited by two critical values of the jacobi constant . in particular , at @xmath91 the neck associated with the lagrangian",
    "point @xmath36 opens .",
    "therefore , in the first subcase , @xmath92 the zvc and the forbidden regions are still present on the configuration space , while for @xmath93 the forbidden regions disappears and all the @xmath2 plane is available for motion .",
    "[ hr4]a shows the structure of the configuration plane for @xmath94 .",

    "[ percs1 ] shows such a diagram , where the vertical dashed black lines indicate the four critical values of @xmath31 .",
    "we observe that at high enough values of the jacobi constat , that is for @xmath97 , the collisional set is the most populated family occupying more than 90% of the configuration space .",
    "however for @xmath86 the percentage of collisional orbits exhibits a sharp decrease until @xmath98 , while for lower values of @xmath31 it saturates around 12% .",
    "as the neck through @xmath0 opens for @xmath82 the rate of escaping orbit to the saturn realm increases until @xmath99 . for lower values of @xmath31",
    "the trend is reversed and for low enough values of the jacobi constant @xmath100 it completely vanishes . for @xmath86",
    "the second channel around @xmath1 also opens and it is seen that the percentage of orbits escaping to the exterior realm displays a rapid increase until @xmath98 . for lower values of @xmath31",
    "the slope of the curve changes and the increase is not so dramatic . nevertheless , when the forbidden regions disappear from the @xmath2 plane the exterior realm basin dominates .",
    "as for the bounded basin it is evident that it is by far the most weak type of orbits .",
    "for @xmath70 the rate of bounded orbits has a mean value around 7.5% , in the interval @xmath101 its mean value drops to 4.5% , while for lower values of @xmath31 this percentage is effectively zero because as we seen in fig .",
    "[ hr4](a - d ) the stability island in the left side of the titan disappears .",
    "the color - coded planes in the configuration @xmath2 space provide sufficient information on the phase space mixing however , for only a fixed value of the jacobi constant and also for orbits that traverse the surface of section either directly ( progradely ) or retrogradely .",
    "hnon back in the late 60s @xcite , in order to overcome these limitations introduced a new type of plane which can provide information about areas of bounded and unbounded motion using the section @xmath102 , @xmath103 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , all the initial conditions of the orbits of the test particles are launched from the @xmath37-axis with @xmath104 , parallel to the @xmath105-axis @xmath79 .",

    "the corresponding escape and collisional times of the orbits are given in fig .",

    "[ xyc](c - d ) we may conclude that the smallest escape / collisonal periods correspond to orbits with initial conditions inside the escape / collison basins , while orbits initiated in the fractal regions of the planes or near the boundaries of stability islands have the highest escape rates .",

    "the planar version of the circular restricted three - body problem was used in this contribution in order to numerically investigate the orbital dynamics of a small body ( spacecraft , comet or asteroid ) under the influence of the potential of the saturn - titan system .",

    "for the numerical integration of the orbits in every grid , we needed about between 1 minute and 5 hours of cpu time on a pentium dual - core 2.2 ghz pc , depending on the escape , collisional and bounded rates of orbits in each case . for each initial condition ,",
    "the maximum time of the numerical integration was set to be equal to 5000 dtu however , when a particle escaped or collided the numerical integration was effectively ended and proceeded to the next available initial condition .",
    "our work contains quantitative information regarding the orbital dynamics in the saturn - titan .",
    "the main numerical results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   in",
    "all examined cases , regions of initial conditions leading to escape in a given direction or to collision with the smaller primary were found to exist .",
    "the several escape / collision basins are very intricately interwoven and they appear either as thin elongated spiral bands or as well - defined broad regions .",
    "it was found that for high values of the jacobi constant , or in other words for low energy levels , the configuration space is dominated by collisional orbits , while some stability islands are also present .",
    "we observed that for low values of the jacobi constant which correspond to high values of the total orbital energy the vast majority of the orbits escape to the exterior realm , while the rest of the @xmath2 plane is occupied by collisional orbits .",
    "it was detected that the average collisional time increases with increasing @xmath31 , while on the other hand , the average escape time , in general terms , diminishes with decreasing @xmath31 . 5 .",
    "our calculations revealed that inside the basins the shortest escape and collision rates of the orbits had been measured . on the contrary , the longest escape / collision rates correspond to initial conditions located near the boundaries between the basins or in the vicinity of the stability islands .",
    "taking into account the detailed and systematic analysis we may conclude that out numerical task has been successfully completed .",
    "we hope that the present results to be useful in the active field of orbital dynamics in the restricted three - body problem . since our outcomes are encouraging , it is in our future plans to expand our investigation into three dimensions and also in other planetary systems .",
