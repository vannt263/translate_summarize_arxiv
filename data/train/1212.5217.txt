    "the ecg is often corrupted by different types of noise , namely , power line interference , electrode contact and motion artifacts , respiration , electrical activity of muscles in the vicinity of the electrodes and interference from other electronic devices .",

    "automatic ecg analysis : denoising should facilitate automatic ecg analysis .",
    "general denoising signal processing methods have been applied to ecg .",
    "low pass linear filters are used for high frequency noise removal , namely power line interference and muscle activity artifacts .",
    "high pass linear filters can be applied to cancel baseline wander .",
    "the use of neural networks to ecg denoising has been , to our knowledge , limited to the removal of these two types of noise .",
    "other denoising tools are median filter , wavelet transform methods , empirical mode decomposition , morphological filters , non linear bayesian filtering and template matching .",
    "we will focus on noise introduced by electrode motion which causes more difficulties in ecg analysis@xcite .",
    "our method adapts to each particular ecg channel and learns how to reproduce it from a noisy version of the different channels available .    in the physionet / cinc challenge 2010",
    "it was shown that we can use some physiological signals to reconstruct another physiological signal , in particular an ecg  @xcite .",
    "this approach to reconstructing the noisy ecg channel is a simplified version , but equally effective , of the winning entry in that challenge .",
    "we show that the procedure is robust against noise in the input signals and can include , as an input , the channel we want to denoise .",
    "this noise removal method is another example of the power of deep neural networks  @xcite , in this case , applied to ecg signals .",
    "if an ecg channel we want to use for ecg analysis is , at some time segment , contaminated with noise , we call it the * target * channel in our denoising process .",
    "the method uses a feedforward neural network .",
    "a prerequisite for applying it is the target channel to be free from noise for some minutes , in order to train the neural network .",
    "the other channels used by the procedure may have noise in training time . if one channel has much more noise than others , it might be better not to use it for the reconstruction , even if it is the target channel .",
    "the neural network will receive the samples as input , from one or more channels , corresponding to time segments with a fixed length",
    ". the output will be the samples from the target channel corresponding to the time segment used in the input .",
    "we used time segments with lengths of between one and three seconds , depending on the channels we use for reconstruction : one second if we use the target channel and another channel , two seconds , if we do not use the target channel , and three seconds , if we only use the target channel .    to reconstruct one ecg channel we collected time segments , @xmath0 from the ecg each one starting 16 samples after the preceding segment . after obtaining the output of the neural network , corresponding to each of the @xmath0",
    ", the value of the reconstruction on sample @xmath1 will be the average value of the sample outputs corresponding to @xmath1 , using all @xmath0 that contain @xmath1 .",
    "the proposed method could be applied to a holter record , reconstructing those time segments where an important level of noise is identified and using the remaining time of the holter record for training .",
    "we used a neural network with three hidden layers .",
    "the number of units on each of those layers was approximately 1000 in all experiments . to train the neural network",
    ", we constructed a sequence of time segments each one starting five samples after the beginning of the previous one .",
    "there is no need to use fiducial points to create input data to the neural network .",
    "we applied geoffrey hinton s method  @xcite to learn the neural network weights : following initialization using a stack of restricted boltzmann machines , we applied backpropagation algorithm to fine tune the weights . for details on the training procedure for restricted boltzmann machines ,",
    "we refer to hinton  @xcite .    as usual , when using feedforward neural networks , we normalized the input data , to accelerate the learning process .",
    "first we applied a moving average filter , with the window size equal to the sampling rate .",
    "then we subtracted the result from the signal , thus reducing the baseline wander . in the output signal , instead of the moving average filter we applied a median filter",
    ": it is more effective in the removal of baseline wander . finally , we scaled the output signal to have unit variance and multiplied the input signals by the same scale factor .",
    "we implemented our method using gnu octave language and , to reduce training and reconstruction time , we ran most time consuming code on a graphics processing unit .",
    "our code is available at the first author s web page .",
    "evaluating ecg denoising methods is not an obvious task .",
    "a common way of doing it is to add add noise to an existing signal and measure the root mean square error ( rmse ) of the denoised signal relative to the original signal .",
    "this approach has some disadvantages .",
    "firstly , when using a large data base of ecgs , is difficult to avoid noise in the original signal , and we do not want to punish the denoising method for not reconstructing the noise in the original signal . secondly , rmse does not always reflect the difficulties in analysing a noisy ecg .",
    "for instance , a constant baseline shift in the reconstructed signal is not very disturbing , but might correspond to a high rmse value .    in this study",
    "we report rmse in the reconstructed signal when we artificially add noise in the ecg , but we also evaluate our method using some publicly available programs that analyse the ecg : we compare the results of applying these programs with and without denoising the corrupted ecg .",
    "although those programs alredy have a preprocessing stage to deal with noise , we show that , in the presence of noise , our denoising method improves their results .",
    "gqrs : :    is a recent qrs detector , not yet published : the author is george    moody .",
    "this program is open source and available with wfdb software ,    from physionet .",
    "there is an accompaining post - processor gqpost    intended to improve positive predictivity , at a cost of reduced    sensitivity .",
    "we report the results of gqrs with and without using    gqpost .",
    "gqpost uses a configuration file gqrs.conf ; we kept the    default values of gqrs.conf. the results of this program gqrs    depend on the value of a threshold parameter ; as we did not find a    systematic way of determining , for each record , the best value for the    threshold , we used the parameter s default value .",
    "for this reason , we    do not report the best possible results of this detector in the    different records and therefore we should not use this study to    compare the perfomance of the different qrs detectors .",
    "limited : :    is an open source program written by patrick s. hamilton  @xcite .",
    "it    performs qrs detection and classifies beats as normal or    ventricular ectopic ( veb ) .",
    "ecgpuwave : :    it is an open source qrs detector and waveform limit locator ,    available as part of the physiotoolkit  @xcite .",
    "the authors are    pablo laguna , raimon jan , eudald bogatell , and david vigo anglada .",
    "all the programs listed above act on a single ecg channel , we did not find publicly available methods using more than one channel .      for qrs detectors we used the following statistics : @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of correctly detected beats , @xmath5 is the number of false detections and @xmath5 is the number of missed beats . for the beat classifier ,",
    "we use , as in  @xcite , the sensitivity , positive predictivity , @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath4 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 are defined as follows :    * @xmath9 is the number of beats correctly classified as veb .",

    "* @xmath11 is the number of beats wrongly classified as veb , excluding fusion and unclassifiable beats .",
    "* @xmath12 is the number of true veb not classified as such .      in most experiments , to test the behavior of our denoising method , we start with a clean ecg and add noise to it .",

    "<S> we propose an ecg denoising method based on a feed forward neural network with three hidden layers . </S>",
    "<S> particulary useful for very noisy signals , this approach uses the available ecg channels to reconstruct a noisy channel . </S>",
    "<S> we tested the method , on all the records from physionet mit - bih arrhythmia database , adding electrode motion artifact noise . </S>",
