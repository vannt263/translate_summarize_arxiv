    "one of the interesting quantum phases is the super solid ( ss ) phase in which the charge density and superconducting / superfluid phases characterized by diagonal and off - diagonal order coexist .",
    "the experimental findings and theoretical search for different quantum phases for cold atoms in optical lattice have revealed many interesting correlated phases of low dimensional bosonic systems @xcite . in this",
    "regard , bose - hubbard model with extended range interactions have been studied in detail to discover the different quantum phases of cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . here",
    "we study the quantum phases of a more general bose - hubbard model , namely , the dimerized bose - hubbard model ( dbh ) with extended range interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model system is given by : @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping terms respectively and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are nn and nnn interactions respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is the on site repulsion energy and @xmath6 is the chemical potential . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dimerization parameter for nn hopping and nn interaction respectively .",
    "manipulation of interaction range and the prediction of different quantum phases in optical lattice loaded with cold atoms is more easily constructed than other correlated systems @xcite .",
    "different combinations of laser beams with inhomogeneous intensity profile and their suitable manipulation can generate long range interactions and anisotropic interactions extending to a desired range .",
    "so our theoretical model ( dbh ) is realizable because of the advances in the quantum state engineering of cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "we believe that our theoretical prediction may help to understand and motivate experimentalist to design many interesting new systems .",
    "before presenting our numerical results , we briefly discuss a field theory for the low energy and long wave length physics of dbh .",

    "we will also see occurrence of gapped phase for several commensurate fillings in our dmrg study , in the next section .",
    "here we build up a general field theoretical study to explain the appearance of gap structure at different commensurate fillings : suppose we consider a periodic potential @xmath46 of periodicity of @xmath47 coupled to the density @xmath48 leading to an additional term in the hamiltonian , @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath29 , an integer and @xmath51 \\sum_{p } e^{2 p i ( \\pi { { \\rho}_x } x - \\phi ( x)}$ ] . following ref .",

    "sine - gordon coupling term becomes relevant and system becomes gapped .",
    "we now present numerical results obtained by using dmrg .",
    "we also compare them with the existing analytical and numerical results .",
    "we use the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method to numerically study the qpd of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "1 . we employ the infinite dmrg algorithm keeping 128 dominant density matrix eigenvectors ( dmev ) for determining @xmath6 while for the calculation of correlation functions we use finite dmrg algorithm keeping the same cut - off in the number of dmevs .",
    "fock space of the site - boson is truncated to four states which allows 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 bosons per site .",
    "the length of the chain studied is 128 sites , except near phase boundaries , where we have used 256 sites for calculating @xmath6 and correlation functions .",
    "accuracy of the method is checked by comparing the ground state ( gs ) energies , various correlation functions and charge gap from dmrg studies with exact diagonalization studies of small systems with upto 12 sites .",
    "we have also reproduced the results of earlier dmrg calculations satisfactorily @xcite .",
    "the discarded density in the dmrg calculations is less than @xmath59 in the charge density wave ( cdw ) phase at @xmath60 as well as in the @xmath61 , mott - insulating phase .",
    "however , the discarded density is slightly less than @xmath62 in the superfluid ( sf ) phase .",
    "we have computed the charge gap ( @xmath63 ) defined as @xmath64 ; @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is number of sites on the chain and @xmath67 , @xmath68 correspond to an extra hole or extra particle at density @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath69 is the gs energy of zero particle or hole number at the same density .",
    "fig . [ fig7.6 ] shows the variation of @xmath63 with @xmath43 for different values of @xmath70 . at @xmath71 , we observe two peaks in the gap at the two densities , @xmath72 and @xmath73 as reported by batrouni @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "these peaks shift to @xmath75 0.35 and @xmath75 0.65 on introducing nonzero @xmath4 .",
    "position of peaks remains the same for the other nonzero value of @xmath4 we have studied .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ fig7.6 ] that the gap occurs only near the two commensurate fillings of 1/3 and 2/3 ( when @xmath4 is included in the interaction ) and disappears for fillings away from these values .",
    "this transition from gapped phase to gapless phase is the commensurate to incommensurate transition ; the latter is due to the mismatch between the underlying periodic potential of the lattice and periodicity in the occupancy of the lattice .",
    "[ fig7.7 ] shows the variation of inverse correlation length of the density - density correlation functions @xmath76 , as well as the structure factor @xmath77 computed for @xmath78 and @xmath79 as a function of boson density , @xmath43 , for two different @xmath4 values , namely @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we first discuss the @xmath82 case .",
    "we note that for @xmath80 , the inverse correlation length shows a peak at @xmath60 and 1.0 at which values we also note a gap in the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig7.6 ] ) .",
    "the underlying periodicity in the charge density at these @xmath43 values corresponds to dimerization as seen from large @xmath83 at these fillings .",
    "we also note that for @xmath84 , the system has vanishing @xmath83 at all fillings .",
    "when @xmath4 is switched on , the peaks in inverse correlation length shift to @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; at these values we also observe a nonzero gap ( fig.[fig7.6 ] ) in the systems .",
    "the underlying charge order corresponds to a periodicity of three lattice sites for @xmath86 , as seen from the peak in @xmath87 .",
    "we also note that @xmath87 is vanishingly small for all @xmath43 in the case of @xmath80 .",
    "these results are also in broad agreement with field theoretic results .",
    "the charge charge correlation function in the gs for hole -doping and particle doping are shown figs .",
    "[ fig7.8]a and [ fig7.8]b respectively .",
    "we note that for the case of hole doping , the defect brakes up into two solitonic states each with charge half , for both values of @xmath4 ( 0.1 and 0.3 ) for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "however , in case of the particle doping , we note that the two cases have quite different behavior .",
    "for @xmath90 we note that the charge - charge correlation function oscillates over the entire chain length . in case of @xmath91 ,",
    "the oscillations are damped in the middle of the chain and become slightly more pronounced at the ends .",
    "this behavior is akin to what is seen in the hole - doping case .    physical picture for this behavior ,",
    "can be arrived at from an analysis of the @xmath92 hamiltonian .",
    "we find that at @xmath60 the lowest energy configuration is the one in which alternate site are occupied by a single boson ( fig .",
    "[ fig7.9]a top row ) . on doping with a single hole we find that the energy reduces by @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ fig7.9]a middle row ) . however , if the state with these consecutive holes is delocalized ( fig .",
    "[ fig7.9]a bottom row ) then there is a further stabilization by @xmath4 .",
    "thus the system prefers to break - up into two defects , with each defect corresponding to two consecutive hole sites .",
    "we can formally associate a charge half with each defect since two defects have been created by a single hole doping .",
    "the case of particle - doping is slightly different . when an empty site is doped ( fig .",
    "[ fig7.9]b topline ) then the energy increase is @xmath94 .",
    "delocalization of the particle , leads to a state with energy @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ fig7.9]b middle line ) , which is stabilized by @xmath4 as in the hole - doped case . however , we can also dope a particle at a site which is already occupied by a boson .",
    "the energy increase corresponds to @xmath96 in this case .",
    "thus , we should observe a 3 consecutive particle state yielding a state with two separated consecutive particle state ( fig .",
    "[ fig7.9]b middle row ) only for @xmath97 .",
    "this is exactly what we find in fig .",
    "[ fig7.9]b .",
    "we can identify the ground state for @xmath98 as a mott insulator state while that for @xmath99 corresponds to a solitonic state .",
    "we now turn our attention to the effect of dimerization on the phase diagrams .",
    "we do not assume simultaneous dimerizations in both @xmath3 and @xmath1 as we wish to explore the role of each of these parameters independently .",
    "the effect of dimerization in @xmath1 appears to smoothen the @xmath43 vs. @xmath6 behavior .",
    "however , the dimerization in @xmath3 seems to lead to higher jumps between plateaus , besides changing the value of @xmath43 at which the plateaus occur .",
    "it is easy to construct a real space picture for the observed @xmath43 vs @xmath6 behavior if we treat the transfer term as perturbation . in a model with next nearest neighbor interaction in the @xmath100 limit ,",
    "it is possible to have a ground state with zero energy for all fillings , @xmath101 for which the particle can be so distributed that the inter particle interaction in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is zero . at ,",
    "@xmath102 , when an extra particle is added , there is jump in the gs energy by @xmath103 which is reflected as a step in the @xmath43 vs. @xmath6 plot .",
    "further addition of particle will increase the gs energy by same amount until @xmath104 , keeping @xmath6 constant between @xmath85 and @xmath105 .",
    "this picture can be extended further for higher fillings .",
    "the effect of the transfer term is to reduce the sharpness of the jumps as well as introduce a slow variation in @xmath6 between jumps . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the chemical potential is nearly @xmath5 for @xmath107 and @xmath94 for @xmath108 , when transfer term is switched on .",
    "dimerization of the lattice does not significantly affect the @xmath43 vs. @xmath6 behavior at least up to @xmath109 .",
    "beyond @xmath109 , the analysis is not straightforward due to the large number of occupancy possibilities afforded by the the bosonic system .",
    "the physics of our system is similar to that of a sawtooth spin chain under a magnetic field mentioned in sec .",
    "@xmath43 of the bosonic model is replaced by the magnetization and @xmath6 is replaced by the magnetic field .",
    "we would like to give the physical explanation of the plateau state following the reference @xcite .",
    "the energy levels of a magnetic chain can be labeled by the @xmath110 value of the state . when an external magnetic field @xmath111 is applied the state",
    "is stabilized by an energy @xmath112 . thus if the @xmath110 value of the gs in the absence of an external field is zero , when the field is turned on , the gs switches progressively to higher values of @xmath110 .",
    "if to begin with , the system had gaps between the lowest energy state in different @xmath110 sectors , then the @xmath110 value of the gs state shows jumps at discrete values of the magnetic field .",
    "this results in plateau in the @xmath110 vs @xmath111 plot .",
    "in summary , we have carried out quantum phase analysis of dimerized bose - hubbard model , emphasing quantum field theoretic treatment as well as dmrg method to follow the quantum phases .",
    "a real space picture of the system in the zero hopping limit gives clear insights into the nature of the quantum phases , which are also predicted by the quantum field in the strongly interacting limit .",
