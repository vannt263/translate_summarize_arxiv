    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) typically display a ` big blue bump ' in their optical / uv spectra interpreted as blackbody emission arising from optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disks .",
    "their hard x - ray power - law spectrum is thought to be produced by comptonization of the soft disk photons in a hot corona above the accretion disk ( e.g. ; haardt & maraschi 1991 ) .",
    "low luminosity agn ( llagn ) , emitting well below their eddington limit ( @xmath7 ) , typically lack the ` big blue bump ' ( e.g. , ho 1999 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2003 for the case of m87 ) and for this reason it has been proposed that in these objects the accretion disk consists of of two zones : an outer thin disk that extends from some large radius down to a transition radius and an inner low - radiative efficiency accretion flow close to the black hole .",
    "fluorescence fe k@xmath0 line emission can be a very powerful probe for the accretion flow geometry around black holes .",
    "such lines have been interpreted as being produced through x - ray irradiation of the accretion disk ; therefore the physical width of the line can serve as a trace of the inner accretion disk extent .",
    "observations of relativistically broadened iron k@xmath0 lines from some seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , mcg-6 - 30 - 15  wilms et al 2001 ; fabian et al .",
    "2002 ) , which require that the disk must be irradiated from an x - ray source within @xmath8 , suggests that at least in this case the accretion disk extends to the last stable orbit .",
    "it is interesting to note that mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( fwhm(h@xmath0)@xmath9 ; sulentic et al .",
    "1998 ) is like narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies ( nls1 ) , which are thought to be accreting at relatively high accretion rates .",
    "in contrast , lasota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that the accretion disk in most llagn must be truncated .",
    "gammie , narayan , and blandford ( 1999 ) have shown the broadband spectrum of ngc  4258 can be explained by emission from a geometrically thin accretion disk + adaf model with a transition radius at @xmath10 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath11 ) . on the basis of their optical / uv continuum spectra , quataert et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , have provided further evidence for such accretion flow geometry and showed that the spectral energy distributions of m  81 and ngc  4579 can be explained by an adaf + disk with a transition radius at @xmath12 .",
    "one prediction from any such models , as discussed in quataert et al ( 1999 ) , is the lack of a relativistically broadened iron k@xmath0 line in the x - ray spectrum of these objects .",
    "the presence , or absence , of this feature in x - ray spectra from _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ can therefore be used to test the accretion flow geometry proposed for llagn .",
    "specifically , any detection of relativistically broad iron k@xmath0 line would strongly argue against truncated disk models .    in this paper , we utilize _ xmm - newton _ observations of two of the best studied llagn , ngc  4579 and m  81 , to investigate whether the observed iron k@xmath0 profiles are consistent with truncated disk models . both ngc  4579 and",

    "our best - fit model does not show any residuals indicating the presence of a substantial reflection continuum ( from either neutral of partially ionized matter from a disk close to the black hole ) in the spectral data of either m81 or ngc  4579 ( see fig .",
    "the apparently lack of reflection continuum was also confirmed by the detailed spectral analysis of the _ bepposax _ observation of m81 ( pellegrini 2000 ) .",
    "it is therefore unlikely the the @xmath85 kev emission is produced by reflection from an ionized disk ( see also  5.2 ) . to assess the possible origin of the @xmath33 broad feature in the spectrum of ngc  4579 as the compton reflection emission",
    ", we fitted a compton reflection model ( pexrav ; magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) along with the absorbed power - law and narrow gaussian line model to the pn spectrum of ngc  4579 .",
    "the best - fit of this reflection model results in an unrealistically large relative reflection parameter , @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 corresponds to a solid angle of @xmath88 subtended by the reflector ) and the fit worsens ( @xmath89 for an additional dof ) in comparison to the best - fit obtained with the absorbed power law and double gaussian line model ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "thus the unphysical value of the reflection parameter and the poor quality of the fit rule out compton reflection emission in place of the fluorescence iron k@xmath0 emission .",

    "2001 ) , however , the strength of the narrow k@xmath0 line is weaker in m  81 , in comparison to that of typical seyfert  1 galaxies ( see e.g. page et al .",
    "the observed narrow - lines from ngc  4579 and m  81 can be produced anywhere in the broad - line region , dusty torus , outer regions of an standard accretion disk or a disk with a flat emissivity law ( yaqoob et al .",
    "2001,2003 ) . the weaker narrow line of m  81 may suggest a smaller covering fraction of the material responsible for the narrow line emission in ngc  4579 than that in m  81 .",
    "the widths and line center energies of the broad k@xmath0 lines from ngc  4579 and m  81 are remarkably similar ( @xmath97 ; fwhm @xmath98 ) suggestive of both an origin in similar regions the agn and a similarity in the ionization stages ( he- or h - like iron ) of the emitting material . the observed line energies are higher than those generally observed from seyfert 1 . in general ,",
    "only narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies ( nls1s ) , with steep x - ray spectra , regularly show strong , highly ionized iron k@xmath0 lines ( dewangan 2002 ) .",
    "in such cases the lines are interpreted as being produced by reflection from material in the disk photo - ionized by the strong x - ray continuum .",
    "the physical problem with explaining the lines in m81 and ngc  4579 in a similar way is that we do not expect photoionization to be important in these low luminosity sources . for photo - ionized material",
    ", the ionization parameter can be written as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the luminosity of ionizing photons , @xmath101 is the density of the material , and @xmath102 is the distance of the material from the ionizing source ( kallman & mccray 1982 ) . for standard thin disks , matt et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have shown that the ionization parameter is strongly dependent on the accretion rate relative to the eddington rate and hence can be rewritten as , @xmath103 . in order to ionize he - like iron ,",
    "@xmath104 should be at least @xmath105 or @xmath106 ( matt et al .",
    "this result is consistent with the observation of highly ionized iron k@xmath0 lines from some nls1s as they are thought to emit a higher fraction of their eddington luminosity ( pounds , done , & osborne 1995 ) .",
    "for ngc  4579 , the total nuclear luminosity of @xmath107 ( barth et al .",
    "1996 ) and black hole mass in the range of @xmath108 ( barth et al .",
    "2001 ) correspond to @xmath109 while laor ( 2003 ) reported @xmath110 .",
    "ho et al . ( 1996 ) found @xmath111 for m  81 which has a black hole mass of @xmath112 .",
    "thus the ionizing luminosity of both the llagns ngc  4579 and m  81 are 3 - 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that required for a photo - ionized accretion disk with he - like iron .",
    "clearly , the dominant ionization process in the disk of ngc  4579 and m  81 can not be photo - ionization .",
    "the widths of the ionized iron k@xmath0 lines from ngc  4579 and m  81 ( fwhm@xmath113 ) are not as broad as the line widths predicted by models of an accretion disk extending down to the last stable orbit .",
    "assuming keplerian motion of the emitting material ( i.e. , @xmath114 ) the size of the broad iron k@xmath0 line emitting material is estimated to be @xmath115 for ngc  4579 and @xmath116 for m  81 , independent of black hole mass .",
    "thus the majority of iron k@xmath0 photons are not produced near the last stable orbit for a schwarzschild ( @xmath117 ) or a kerr black hole ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from the disk - line fits which resulted in @xmath119 for ngc  4579 and @xmath120 for m  81 .",
    "two possible scenarios that can explain the observed moderate line widths and their @xmath121 centroid energy are : ( @xmath73 ) the accretion disk is fully ionized for @xmath122 so there are no lines arising from within this region , or ( @xmath123 ) the accretion disk is truncated at @xmath124 . as discussed above , however , the accretion disk can not be photo - ionized by irradiation , and thus must be intrinsically hot . both ( @xmath73 ) and ( @xmath123 )",
    "then imply that the inner regions of the accretion flows in m  81 and ngc  4579 llagns are likely to be different from those of typical seyfert galaxies .",
    "our results are consistent with the suggestion that llagn have accretion disks that are truncated at some large radii and have a hot flow in the inner regions ( lasota et al .",
    "1996 ; narayan 1996 ; gammie et al .",
    "; li & wang 2000 ) . in particular",
    ", the inner radius @xmath125 of the accretion disk implied by the observed iron line width is fully consistent with the position of the truncation radius deduced from the modeling of the optical / uv spectra of m  81 and ngc  4579 by quataert et al .",
    "( 1999 ; assuming a geometrically - thin accretion disk and an optically thin , two - temperature adaf in the inner regions ) .",
    "note also that in this model , the continuum x - ray emission is produced in the inner region of the hot flow ( from @xmath126 ) and is due to comptonization of synchrotron emission from the flow .",
    "we suggest that the relatively broad @xmath85 kev lines may arise from regions of the flow close to or at the transition radius , where the hot , fully ionized flow starts cooling to connect to the outer optically thick , geometrically thin region . using the dynamical solutions of the transition regions from a thin disk to an adaf recently derived by manmoto et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we can try to estimate the densities and temperatures typical for this transition region . in order for the hot flow to connect to a standard thin disk the temperature and velocity of the gas must change by orders of magnitude over a small transition region between the adaf and the thin disk . for a transition radius of @xmath127 , the temperature ( @xmath128 ) scales as @xmath129 in the inner regions , and as it approaches the transition radius , it then drops sharply from values of @xmath130 k at @xmath131 to @xmath132 k at @xmath133 and cooler beyond . as pressure balance has to be maintained , the density of the flow increases sharply ( by @xmath1342 orders of magnitude ) in the same range of radii , reaching values of @xmath135 @xmath136 at @xmath133 . even using the values of the flow density derived above ,",
    "photo - ionization in the transition region is not likely to be important because of the low level of the ionizing hard x - ray flux , in fact , at the transition region we find that the ionization parameter @xmath1371 . instead , the observed he - like and h - like iron lines are likely to represent collisionally ionized x - ray lines produced in a hot , @xmath138 k , transition region .",
    "specific calculations of the emission line profiles from this region are not available at the moment and would be necessary to fully explore this hypothesis . to test this inference , therefore , we consider a simple thermal plasma model ( mekal ; liedahl , osterheld , & goldstein ( 1995 ) and references therein ) and fit it in combination with a power - law continuum and a narrow gaussian emission line at @xmath1 ( fixed ) to the pn and mod spectra jointly . the density of the plasma was fixed to @xmath139 ( as derived above ) and no intrinsic absorption is required .",
    "the mekal model was convolved with a gaussian in order to mimic the line broadening due to keplerian motion of the plasma at the transition region .",

    "the success of this model in reproducing the observed iron k@xmath0 profiles suggests that the observed lines could be produced by collisional excitation in a relatively hot transition region between a hot flow and a thin disk .",
    "the truncation radii of @xmath151 radii inferred by quataert et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to fit the optical / uv to x - ray sed is somewhat larger than the best - fit inner radii inferred from the diskline model fits to the iron k@xmath0 line profile .",
    "however , is has been noted the if a standard disk is connected to an adaf across a narrow transition layer , the gas near the transition radius must rotate with a super - keplerian angular velocity ( abramowicz , igumenshchev , & lasota 1998 ) this means @xmath152 or @xmath153 .",
    "additionally , the transition region , being hot ( @xmath154 ) , may not contribute the optical / uv emission which determined the truncation radius quoted by quataert et al .",
    "note also that adafs are likely to develop strong outflows ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) or convection ( quataert & gruzinov 1999 ; narayan et al . 2000 ) which are likely to change the dynamics of the transition region .",
    "the broad iron line components of ngc  4579 and m  81 can also be described in terms of multiple narrow emission lines from ionized iron , although with a lesser statistical significance .",
    "such lines can arise from ( @xmath73 ) hot thermal plasma , if present , outside the accretion disk e.g host galaxy , or ( @xmath123 ) a photo - ionized accretion disk with flat emissivity law extending down to the last stable orbit ( yaqoob et al .",
    "the former process has already been ruled out due to the variability of the iron line from ngc  4579 ( terashima et al .",
    "the later possibility is unlikely due to a low ionization parameter ( see @xmath155 ) .",

    "<S> we report on _ xmm - newton _ spectroscopy of the low - luminosity active galaxies ( llagn ) m81 and ngc  4579 both of which have known black hole masses and well - sampled spectral energy distributions ( sed ) . </S>",
    "<S> the iron k@xmath0 line profiles from both the llagn can be described in terms of two components  a narrow line at @xmath1 and a moderately broad line ( fwhm @xmath2 ) arising from highly ionized , he - like or h - like species ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the broad lines arising from an accretion disk the inner edge of which is restricted to large radii ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the eddington ratio , @xmath5 , of these sources , is 34 orders of magnitude lower than that required to photo - ionize a cold disk to he - like iron . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the lines can be explained as collisionally ionized x - ray lines arising from the transition region between a hot ( radiatively inefficient ) flow in the inner regions and a cold disk outside @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion flow geometry probed by our _ xmm - newton _ observations is consistent with the truncated disk models proposed to explain the sed of llagns . </S>"
