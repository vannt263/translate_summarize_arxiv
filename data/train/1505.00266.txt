    "the ubiquity of carbon in the interstellar medium combined with the relatively low ionization potential and modest excitation temperature make the [ cii ] line bright , with as much as 0.1  1% of the total bolometric luminosity of the host galaxy emitted in this single line @xcite .",

    "the empirical relation between [ cii ] and the bolometric far - ir luminosity allows the observed [ cii ] intensity to serve as a tracer of star - formation activity @xcite , while the ratio of [ cii ] to other far - ir lines probes physical conditions within different phases of interstellar medium of the host galaxies @xcite .",
