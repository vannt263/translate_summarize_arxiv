    "the homunculus nebula around @xmath0 carinae is composed of a striking pair of lumpy bipolar lobes divided by a ragged equatorial skirt ( morse et al .  1998 ; duschl et al .  1995 ;",
    "smith et al .  2000 ; smith & gehrz 2000 ) .",
    "it is primarily a reflection nebula at uv , visual , and near - ir wavelengths , since it is highly polarized ( thackeray 1956b , 1961 ; visvanathan 1967 ; meaburn et al .  1993 ; schulte - ladbeck et al.1999 ) , and because stellar wind emission lines are seen reflected by the nebula ( allen & hillier 1991 ; davidson et al .  1995 ; smith et al .",

    "2005 ) . while spectacular in appearance",
    ", scattered - light images do not give a clear picture of the three dimensional ( 3d ) shape , tilt angle , or detailed structure of the nebula because the optical depth is near unity and the inclination angle hides parts of the nebula .",
    "additionally , the underlying structure giving rise to the clumpy , mottled appearance of the polar lobes in _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and infrared ( ir ) images defies easy explanation .",
    "different datasets imply different mass distributions in dark lanes , holes , and bright cells or clumps ( e.g. , morse et al .",
    "1998 ; smith et al .",
    "1998 ) , evoking entertaining comparisons to structures seen in convection cells and vegetables .    because of its prominence and a wealth of high - quality observational data , the homunculus is an important prototype of bipolar nebulae , being the focus of numerous theoretical studies ( frank et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ; owocki & gayley 1997 ; dwarkadas & balick 1998 ; langer et al.1999 ; dwarkadas & owocki 2002 ; owocki 2003 ; soker 2001 , 2004 ; matt & balick 2004 ; gonzalez et al .  2004a , 2004b ) .",
    "yet , the formation of its clumpy bipolar lobes remains an enduring mystery .",
    "even more perplexing is its ragged equatorial disk , which makes the homunculus unique among bipolar nebulae ( davidson et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ; zethson et al .  1999",
    "; smith & gehrz 1998 ; smith et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ) . detailed study of this nebula provides one of our most valuable ways to learn about the great eruption of @xmath0 carinae in the mid-19th century , since proper motions indicate that the nebula was ejected in that event ( gaviola 1950 ; ringuelet 1958 ; currie et al .",
    "1996 ; smith & gehrz 1998 ; morse et al .",
    "an important observational goal is to measure the exact shape and mass distribution in the nebula , because it bears the direct imprint of the physics of the great eruption as a function of latitude .",
    "this , in turn , can constrain the roles of rotation , binarity , and the hydrodynamics of interacting winds in the formation of bipolar structure .",
    "thermal - ir observations have yielded important clues about the structure of the homunculus , because the nebula is optically thin at these wavelengths ( they have also provided our best estimates of its total mass of more than 10 m@xmath5 and ir luminosity of 4.3@xmath1110@xmath12 l@xmath5 ; smith et al .",
    "mid - ir maps by hackwell , gehrz , & grasdalen ( 1986 ) first revealed that the bipolar nebula consisted of a pair of hollow , limb - brightened osculating spheroids .",
    "this basic structure was later supported by a much higher resolution monochromatic 12 @xmath13 image ( smith et al .",
    "1995 ) , multiwavelength mid - ir images ( smith et al .  1998 ; polomski et al.1999 ) , mid - ir imaging polarimetry ( aitken et al .",
    "1995 ) , and spectroscopy ( hillier & allen 1992 ; meaburn et al .  1993 ) . while the homunculus had roughly the same size in thermal emission from 8 to 13 @xmath13 , smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) noted that it was considerably larger in scattered light images at @xmath14 .",
    "this mystery was resolved with higher resolution thermal - ir imaging using larger telescopes .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2003b ) used images from the magellan observatory to demonstrate that the nebula was also larger at 1825 @xmath13 than at 813 @xmath13 . in that paper",
    ", we proposed a _",
    "double - shell structure _ for the polar lobes , wherein a warm ( @xmath10200 k ) inner shell dominates the 813 @xmath13 images , and a cooler ( @xmath10140 k ) outer skin dominates at longer wavelengths .",
    "the double - shell structure will be an important recurring theme in the present investigation .",
    "this model also indicated that most of the @xmath1510 m@xmath5 in the homunculus was associated with the cool outer skin of the polar lobes , settling an earlier debate about the origin of the far - ir emission from @xmath0 car ( davidson & smith 2000 ; morris et al .",
    "thermal - ir maps show complex dust structure in the homunculosity core as well ( smith et al .  1995 , 2002 ; chesneau et al.2005 ) , which will be discussed in detail at the end of this paper .",
    "since the homunculus is essentially a ballistic expanding hubble flow , measured doppler shifts in the ejecta provide another viable method to trace the 3d shape .",
    "several authors have utilized this technique with spectroscopy of visual - wavelength emission lines ( thackeray 1951 , 1956a , 1956b , 1961 ; meaburn et al .  1987 , 1993 ; hillier & allen 1992 ; allen & hillier 1991 , 1993 ; currie et al .  1996 ; meaburn 1999 ) , as well as imaging polarimetry ( schulte - ladbeck et al .  1999 ) .",
    "however , none of these various studies gave a definitive measure of the shape , largely due to the low spatial resolution of ground - based spectroscopy , plus the very bright scattered continuum light and high optical depth of the dusty nebula at visual wavelengths ( see hillier 1997 for a review of proposed model shapes ) .",
    "this situation improved significantly when high spatial resolution optical spectra from the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) became available .",
    "davidson et al .  ( 2001 ) studied the kinematic structure of narrow [ ni  ii ] and [ fe  ii ] emission lines in stis spectra to give the first clear picture of the shape of the polar lobes and their inclination angle , plus the first genuine detection of the thin equatorial disk .",
    "however , our major result in that study was still rather unsatisfying : our model shape that best fit the kinematic data ( `` model 1 '' of davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) yielded a projected image of the polar lobes that was _ far too small and skinny _ to explain images of the homunculus .",
    "we shall see below that the solution to this mystery is that the [ ni  ii ] and [ fe  ii ] lines studied at visual wavelengths actually trace a smaller inner shell of the polar lobes , and not the dominant outer layer of the homunculus seen in images .",
    "the discovery of molecular gas in the homunculus ( smith 2002a ; smith & davidson 2001 ) provided a powerful new tool to study its structure via near - ir emission from h@xmath1 @xmath16=10 s(1 ) @xmath221218 .",
    "this emission line is bright and narrow , is only seen in intrinsic emission from the polar lobes ( no confusing reflected emission ) , and is at a wavelength of @xmath102  @xmath13 where we can begin to see through to the back of the homunculus .",
    "hence , spectra of h@xmath1 revealed emission from the far side of the homunculus lobes for the first time ( smith 2002a ) .",
    "smith ( 2002a ) showed that the h@xmath1 emission most likely originates in an outer shell , separate from the inner [ fe  ii ] shell .",
    "thus , h@xmath1 probably traces gas associated with the same outer cool dust shell seen in thermal - ir images ( smith et al .",
    "it is therefore our most powerful kinematic diagnostic of the majority of the mass in the homunculus , and traces the component of the nebula that dominates images .",
    "however , earlier [ fe  ii ] and h@xmath1 spectra had inadequate spectral resolution to clearly discern the relative thickness of the two shells or their detailed structure .",
    "the present study aims to rectify this situation using long - slit spectra of h@xmath1 and [ fe  ii ] obtained with much higher dispersion .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath1760,000 ; @xmath105 km s@xmath18 ) near - ir spectra of @xmath0 car were obtained on 2005 march 1 and 2 using the phoenix spectrograph ( hinkle et al .",
    "2003 ) on the gemini south telescope .",
    "phoenix has a 1024@xmath11256 insb detector with a pixel scale of 0@xmath19085@xmath111.4 km s@xmath18 at a wavelength of @xmath101.6  @xmath20 m , and 1.26 km s@xmath18 at @xmath102  @xmath13 .",
    "sky conditions were photometric , and the seeing was typically 0@xmath1930@xmath195 ( better at the longer wavelength ) .",
    "removal of airglow lines was accomplished by subtracting an observation of an off - source position 35@xmath21 southeast of the star .",
    "the 0@xmath1925-wide long - slit aperture was oriented at p.a.=310@xmath22 along the polar axis of the homunculus . to sample the kinematics across the nebula ,",
    "the slit was positioned on the bright central star , plus offsets of 1@xmath21 and 2@xmath21 in either direction perpendicular to the slit axis as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the observations were very similar to those described in earlier papers presenting phoenix data ( smith 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "hr  3685 and hr  4621 were observed with phoenix on the same nights with the same grating settings in order to correct for telluric absorption and for flux calibration .",
    "telluric lines were used for wavelength calibration , using the telluric spectrum available from noao .",
    "velocities were calculated adopting a vacuum rest wavelength of 16439.981   for the [ fe  ii ] ( @xmath23 ) line , and 21218.356   for h@xmath1 @xmath16=10 s(1 ) .",
    "these velocities were corrected to a heliocentric reference frame ; heliocentric velocities will be quoted here .",
    "uncertainty in the resulting velocities is @xmath91 km s@xmath18 , dominated by scatter in the dispersion solution for telluric lines .    at all five slit placements",
    ", long - slit spectra were obtained for the two emission lines : [ fe  ii ] @xmath216435 and h@xmath1 @xmath221218 .",
    "these were suspected to be the most unambiguous tracers of the structure in the polar lobes of the homunculus at near - ir wavelengths that can penetrate the dusty nebula ( smith 2002a ) .",
    "the phoenix slit is shorter than the @xmath1018  extent of the homunculus , so each offset position in figure 1 actually consisted of exposures at three steps along the slit that were shifted and combined later to yield a greater effective slit length . at each pointing , two or three exposures , each consisting of 2@xmath1160-second integrations ( to avoid severe saturation ) were obtained .",
    "depending on the overlap at various positions along the slit , the total effective integration time after adding all exposures for a given slit position varied from 240 to 1080 seconds .",
    "earlier experience with phoenix ( smith 2004 , 2005 ) revealed that the maximal extent of the blue and redshifted h@xmath1 velocities in the homunculus reached slightly beyond the usable bandwith of a single phoenix exposure .",
    "therefore , for h@xmath1 emission , observations were obtained at two different grating settings separated by about 400 km s@xmath18 ; one optimized for including the structure of the blushifted polar lobe and one for the redshifted lobe .",
    "the exposures at the redshifted setting were then scaled to have exactly the same dispersion per pixel , and combined with the blueshifted data .",
    "( since the extreme redshifted velocities are only seen in the northwest polar lobe , the southeast pointings along the slit were ignored .",
    "this explains the data gap in the lower right corner of each panel on the right side of fig .  2 .",
    ")    figure 2 shows the resulting long - slit data for [ fe  ii ] and h@xmath1 , respectively , at the five different slit positions , where a linear fit to the bright reflected continuum light in the homunculus has been subtracted out to enhance the contrast of the line emission ( see smith 2002a , 2004 , 2005 for more details ) .",
    "the vertical dashed lines in figure 2 mark the systemic velocity of @xmath0 car at 8.1 km s@xmath18 , measured from earlier phoenix spectra of h@xmath1 in the homunculus ( smith 2004 ) .",
    "three distinct kinematic components can be seen in figures 2 and 3 : 1 ) a thin outer shell of h@xmath1 at @xmath9600 km s@xmath18 and @xmath98 , 2 ) a thicker inner skin of [ fe  ii ] at @xmath9500 km s@xmath18 and @xmath98 , and 3 ) [ fe  ii ] emission at @xmath9250 km s@xmath18 and @xmath92  from the smaller bipolar nebula known as the `` little homunculus '' , which was the subject of a previous paper ( smith 2005 ) .",
    "emission in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "this is because it is younger and thus follows a different hubble law than the larger homunculus ( smith 2005 ; ishibashi et al .",
    "2003 ) . ]",
    "it is clear from figure 3 that h@xmath1 and [ fe  ii ] emission in the polar lobes do not share the same spatial distribution .",
    "in fact , they are strongly anticorrelated .",
    "the observed kinematic structure gives a dramatic and independent confirmation of the double - shell structure proposed intially from thermal - ir images ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ) , consisting of a warm inner dust shell , plus a cooler and denser outer shell .",
    "here , the [ fe  ii ] emission clearly traces the warmer inner shell , while the h@xmath1 emission corresponds to the more massive thin outer skin .",
    "[ fe  ii ] emission in figures 2 and 3 coincides with the warmer inner dust shell of the polar lobes , and therefore traces only about 10% of the total mass in the homunculus ( smith et al .",
    "for this reason , the main focus of the present paper will be on the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "however , a few comments are in order , as the kinematic structure of the inner [ fe  ii ] shell is closely related to the more massive cool h@xmath1 skin .    at all latitudes , [ fe  ii ]",
    "emission from the lobes has a smaller radius than the h@xmath1 emission and clearly represents a separate component of the nebula .",
    "the infrared [ fe  ii ] emission shown here is emitted by the same gas that gives rise to optical [ ni  ii ] and [ fe  ii ] lines .",
    "this explains why davidson et al.(2001 ) found that their shape for the homunculus derived from spectra was too small and skinny compared to images .",
    "the inner [ fe  ii ] layer and the double - shell structure may also hold clues for understanding polarization studies of the homunculus . while dust in the outer h@xmath1 skin traces the main scattering layer seen in visual images , dust associated with the inner [ fe  ii ] zone may contribute significantly to the observed polarization .",
    "if the outer layer contains predominantly large grains that behave like black - bodies at thermal - ir wavelengths , and the inner [ fe  ii ] layer contains smaller grains with higher temperatures ( as observed ) that are seen through holes in the clumpy h@xmath1 skin , it may go a long way toward explaining the apparent contradictions in grain properties inferred independently from thermal - ir emission and visual to near - ir polarization ( walsh & ageorges 2000 ; schulte - ladbeck et al .",
    "1999 ; smith et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "the [ fe  ii ] layer is thicker and more irregular than the h@xmath1 shell , partially filling the interior of the lobes , especially evident in figure 3 .",
    "its origin and relationship to the more massive h@xmath1 shell are not clear . on one hand",
    ", the observed double - shell structure resembles a classic two - shock structure of a wind plowing into an ambient medium . in this interpretation , the [ fe  ii ]",
    "shell might represent emission from cooling stellar wind material that has passed through a reverse shock",
    ". the actual shock velocity could be quite low ( less than 100 km s@xmath18 ) , since the homunculus expansion speed at high latitudes is not much different than the post - eruption stellar wind speed ( smith et al .",
    "on the other hand , the [ fe  ii ] ( and warm dust ) layer may simply be a photodissociation region , where the radiation field from the central star is still too strong to allow h@xmath1 to exist .",
    "dust in this region attenuates uv light , eventually allowing h@xmath1 to survive at larger radii ( see , e.g. , ferland et al .",
    "an almost identical double - shell structure of h@xmath1 and [ fe  ii ] also exists in the famous planetary nebula m  2 - 9 ( hora & latter 1994 ; smith , balick , & gehrz 2005 ) .    at all five slit positions , the [ fe  ii ]",
    "emission from the little homunculus is much brighter in the blueshifted ( se ) lobe , while the [ fe  ii ] from the larger homunculus is always brighter in the redshifted ( nw ) lobe .",
    "previously , this had been interpreted as attenuation of light from the nw lobe of the little homunculus as it passed through dust in the equator ( smith 2005 ) , while the brightness asymmetry in the larger lobes was caused by the thick polar caps and thinner side walls of the nebula ( davidson et al .",
    "2001 ; hillier & allen 1992 ) .",
    "together , these two explanations have a hint of inconsistency .",
    "a more plausible conjecture might be that the redshifted little homunculus lobe has a lower density and is therefore optically thinner in the balmer continuum , allowing more uv to leak through to illuminate the larger polar lobe .",
    "a higher density in the se polar lobe of the little homunculus would explain why it is brighter in the near - ir , and may help explain the variable extended radio continuum and predominantly blueshifted radio recombination lines ( duncan & white 2003 ; duncan et al .",
    "in any case , the spatial extent of the little homunculus ( smith 2005 ) matches the extent of variable radio continuum emission ( duncan & white 2003 ) , so it would appear that the radio outbursts of @xmath0 car during the 5.5 yr cycle are due the little homunculus absorbing all the lyman continuum radiation that escapes from a variable central source .    some faint [ fe  ii ] emission from the equatorial skirt is present as well in panels b and c of figures 2 and 3 , as had been seen previously in [ fe  ii ] , [ ni  ii ] , [ ca  ii ] , and he  i @xmath210830 ( zethson et al .  1999 ; davidson et al .",
    "2001 ; smith 2002a ; hartman et al .",
    "the reader should be cautioned that the curved [ fe  ii ] emission feature extending from the center to the lower right in each panel of figure 2 is not intrinsic emission from gas in the homunculus ; it is a narrow emission line from the weigelt knots near the star that is reflected and redshifted by expanding dust in the se polar lobe ( see smith 2002a ; davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "while bright [ fe  ii ] emission is seen in all nebulae around luminous blue variables ( smith 2002b ) , @xmath0 car is the only one where h@xmath1 emission has been detected .",
    "this unique emission feature in the homunculus turns out to be extremely valuable in deducing the shape and other physical properties of the homunculus , as detailed in the rest of this paper .",
    "this is because the h@xmath1 emission traces the cool and dense outer skin of the homunculus , which thermal - ir observations indicate contains the majority of the nebula s mass and kinetic energy ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "seen at the high spectral resolution provided by the phoenix spectrograph on gemini south , the outer h@xmath1 skin is remarkably thin and uniform . the thickness of the h@xmath1 shell ( @xmath3r ) is typically 300600 au ( 0.51@xmath1110@xmath24 cm ) , or roughly 23%  of the polar radius ( r ) .",
    "_ this gives us an important clue to the short duration of the most important mass - loss during the great eruption_. in previous studies , i have commented that the thickness of the lobes compared to their largest radius ( @xmath3r / r ) is about 1  / 8 , which is the same as the duration of the bright phase of the great eruption compared to the time elapsed since then : @xmath3t / t = 20yr/160yr ( smith et al .",
    "1998 , 2003b ; smith 2002a ) .",
    "however , now we see that this estimate corresponds to both the inner and outer portions of the double shell structure , with only a small fraction of the mass ( @xmath410% ) found in the thicker , warmer inner shell .",
    "the very thin outer shell , where 90% of the mass resides , would seem to imply that @xmath3t / t is only a few per cent , so that the duration of the dominant mass ejection phase was @xmath45 yr .",
    "this is supported by the small age dispersion derived from high - precision proper motion measurements with _ hst _",
    "( e.g. , morse et al .",
    "this , in turn , would imply a _ huge _ instantaneous mass - loss rate during the peak of the eruption of about 25 m@xmath5 yr@xmath18 .",
    "this may be higher than the limit for a super - eddington continuum - driven wind ( owocki et al .",
    "2004 ; shaviv 2000 ) .",
    "such a short duration for the eruption and the corresponding high ratio of mechanical to radiative energy may point instead to a mechanism more like a hydrodynamic explosion originating deep within the star ( e.g. , arnett et al .  2005 ; young 2005 ) .",
    "however , the very thin h@xmath1 skin also requires a very small velocity dispersion at each latitude during the original ejection , which is not a property that one usually associates with an explosion .",
    "a caveat , of course , is that even though the homunculus is seen as a hubble flow today , we can not be certain that @xmath3r / r exactly traces @xmath3t / t , since thermal collapse of the shell or `` pile - up '' in the ejecta may have occurred during or shortly after the eruption . shell .",
    "] no observations currently exist with which one can reliably rule out either possibility , so both wind and explosion models are worth exploring theoretically .    in any case , the outer h@xmath1 skin is remarkably thin at the present epoch  thinner than had been recognized in previous near - ir spectroscopy or thermal - ir imaging ( smith 2002a ; smith et al .",
    "this narrow outermost layer gives rise to a sharp absorption feature at 513 km s@xmath18 where it crosses our line of sight to the central star , seen in h@xmath1 as well as several low - ionization metals like ti  ii and fe  i in uv spectra of @xmath0  car ( gull et al.2005 ; nielsen et al .",
    "instead of tracing just one sightline , long - slit near - ir spectra have the advantage of showing emission patterns from the full homunculus . comparing the uv absorption profiles of gull et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to the spectra in figure 2 , it is clear that the 513 km s@xmath18 component is from the outer h@xmath1 skin , the 146 km s@xmath18 component arises in the `` little homunculus '' ( as noted already by smith 2002a and smith 2005 ) , and the several intermediate velocity components seen in low ionization metals correspond to the thick lumpy [ fe  ii ] emitting layer seen in the near - ir ( note that the 513 and 146 km s@xmath18 absorption components are indentified by small white dots on the spectrum with the slit passing through the star in figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "in the discussion in following sections , it will ease matters if it is fair to assume that the h@xmath1 layer can be approximated as a thin skin of uniform density and constant thickness .",
    "the h@xmath1 skin obviously has some clumping and some minor brightness variations , but overall the shell has a remarkably constant thickness and brightness  certainly within @xmath950% .",
    "one apparent exception to the large - scale symmetry is in the portions of the walls of the polar lobes that run tangent to our line of sight , projected near the position of the star .",
    "these portions appear much fainter in figure 2 than the corresponding parts of the lobes at the same latitudes ( 040 ) which are nearly in the plane of the sky and are seen perpendicular to the dispersion direction .",
    "these differences give the impression of strong point symmetry in the brightness distribution at low latitudes in the homunculus .",
    "however , it is not certain that this effect is real .",
    "the problem is that the fainter portions are narrow features stretching along the dispersion direction , and coincide spatially with very bright reflected continuum emission that has been subtracted .",
    "it is quite possible that some h@xmath1 emission was subtracted - out when attempting to fit the continuum at these positions .",
    "also , these regions may suffer considerable internal extinction as we look through the limb of the outer dust shell . on the other hand ,",
    "if these differences mark a real deficit of material , then the possible departures from a uniform - density model discussed here are in the sense that there will be additional missing material at low latitudes in the side walls of the polar lobes , as compared to the assumption of a uniform skin .",
    "this would only reinforce the general conclusion that most of the mass is at high latitudes ( see  5 ) .",
    "since near - ir h@xmath1 emission traces the outer dust shell with most of the mass in the homunculus , and the primary dust scattering layer that dominates continuum images of the reflection nebula ( e.g. , davidson & ruiz 1975 ) , it is our most valuable diagnostic of the true shape of the homunculus .",

    "2001 ; smith 2002a ) .",
    "however , it is seen in absorption , tracing only the near side of each lobe . ] the slit position passing through the central star is best for this purpose , as it is oriented along the symmetry axis of the nebula at p.a.@xmath25310 .",
    "the age of the homunculus is @xmath10160 yr based on proper motion measurements and on the most dramatic change in brightness during the great eruption ( currie et al .",
    "1996 ; smith & gehrz 1998 ; morse et al .  2001 ; frew 2004 ) , and the entire outflow is essentially a hubble flow .",
    "therefore , the observed doppler shift in km s@xmath18 ( @xmath26 ) translates directly to distance from the plane of the sky as @xmath27=33.5@xmath28 , measured in au .",
    "similarly , for a given distance from earth , the pixel scale in arcseconds can be converted to a physical distance in the plane of the sky in order to create a model shape with the correct physical proportion .",
    "assuming axial symmetry then yields an independent estimate of the distance to @xmath0 car , and the orientation of the homunculosity ( see also davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the measured h@xmath1 emission shape for a cross section through the symmetry axis of the homunculus ( with the slit centered on the star ) .",
    "the relative scale of the spatial and velocity axes was adjusted to yield a model shape with the greatest degree of axial symmetry , and then rotated so that the polar axis is vertical in figure 4 ( figs .",
    "3f  h were created the same way ) . the distance and inclination angle adopted to make figure 4 are @xmath29=2350@xmath950 pc and @xmath30=41@xmath310@xmath90@xmath315 , respectively .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath30 given here corresponds to the tilt of the polar axis out of the line of sight .",
    "it is the same quantity as the inclination defined for binary system orbits , so that the polar axis is tilted from the plane of the sky by 49 .",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by real deviations from axial symmetry in the homunculus , which are of order 23%  of the radius .",
    "this distance estimate is larger than previous estimates using the same technique ( smith 2002a ; davidson et al.2001 , allen & hillier 1993 ) , but the various studies agree to within the uncertainty .",
    "the distance derived here , however , is the first to use high - resolution data for the outer h@xmath1 shell that is actually seen in images , instead of the interior [ fe  ii ] and [ ni  ii ] emitting layer .    the best fitting idealized symmetric model for the shape of the polar lobes is plotted over the data in figure 4 .",
    "this curve provides a direct measure of the size ( radial separation from the star in au ) of the homunculus as a function of latitude , which is listed in table 1 .",
    "this is a definitive measure of the true 3d shape of the nebula ; it supersedes previous efforts largely because doppler shifts of the narrow molecular hydrogen line constitute such a powerful and unique tracer of the outer massive shell of the homunculus .",
    "earlier studies using optical [ fe  ii ] and [ ni  ii ] were not measuring the outer shell at all , but instead measured the inner shell , which has an entirely different shape . the word `` definitive '' in this context is not hyperbole , because one ca nt do much better with observational data  uncertanties in the derived model shape are dominated by the inherent corrugations in polar lobe surfaces , which are , in turn , comparable to the thickness of the shell .",
    "hopefully , the model shape in figure 4 and table 1 will be used to constrain future theoretical investigations of the formation of bipolar nebulae in general , and the homunculus in particular .      of course , the homunculus lobes are not _ perfectly _ symmetric .",
    "departures from axial symmetry are most apparent in the near side of the se lobe , which appears somewhat scrunched or `` snub - nosed '' overall , and has a few large dents at some slit positions , especially at the corners and right at the polar axis .",
    "these features have been mentioned before as they are apparent in images ( e.g. , morse et al.1998 ) .",
    "this is only obvious in the se lobe  by contrast , the nw lobe shape obeys axial symmetry to a higher degree , showing only a few minor corrugations .",
    "overall , the h@xmath1 shell appears smoother in the side walls than in the polar caps .",
    "the polar regions of the lobes show several clumps or cells in the h@xmath1 spectra , as well as in high - resolution _ hst _ images ( morse et al .",
    "these correspond to minor wiggles or corrugations in the shape of the nebula  but these deviations from a smooth shape in the radial direction are smaller than sizes of cells in images . in other words , these are not three - dimensional `` clumps '' in the normal sense , but rather , fractal divisions of the outer shell s surface .",
    "they are more like irregular plates in the thin shell , which bring to mind analogies with rapid cooling and thermal instabilities or convection cells .",
    "these analogies may be appropriate during the optically thick , rapidly cooling phase after the material was ejected .",
    "the bright h@xmath1 features , presumably tracing the densest material , correspond to bright features in optical images , rather than dark lanes .",
    "the maximum radial expansion speed does not occur at the pole , but at latitudes around 6570  ( fig .",
    "this gives rise to a hint of a trapezoidal shape to the lobes of the homunculus .",
    "this trapezoidal shape is more obvious in the polar lobes of the lh ; this coincidence suggests a common physical mechanism at work .",
    "one possibility is that this results from extra ram pressure inside the corners of the lobes , arising from the deflection of the post - eruption wind that the inner side - walls of the polar lobes at an oblique angle .",
    "such effects are present in simulations of bipolar wind - blown bubbles ( e.g. , cunningham , frank , & hartmann 2005 ; frank et al .",
    "this extra ram pressure would not be related to the opening angle of the shock cone in a binary system , since during the eruption it is likely that the shock cone was collapsed onto the secondary star .",
    "the homunculus bears the imprint of the great eruption s mass loss as a function of latitude .",
    "therefore , the shape and structure of the h@xmath1 emission in high - resolution spectra provide important insight to the physics of the outburst , to the extent that h@xmath1 is a good tracer of the mass .",
    "figure 5 shows the latitude dependence of velocity , mass loss , and mechanical energy in the homunculus , based on h@xmath1 emission .",
    "the velocity distribution follows directly from the shape of the nebula , since it is a hubble flow .",
    "however , calculating these distributions of mass and kinetic energy requires a few assumptions . as a first approximation ,",
    "the thin outer h@xmath1 shell of the homunculus is taken to be of uniform density with a constant width . the apparent width in phoenix",
    "spectra is very nearly constant , with variations typically less than a factor of 2 .",
    "note that the thicker appearance of the h@xmath1 shell at slit offset positions ne2 and sw2 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is somewhat misleading , since these slit positions slice through the lobes at an oblique angle to their surfaces .",
    "if this assumption applies , then the mass in various parts of the shell is simply proportional to its geometric surface area at each latitude . while the nebula is obviously not perfectly uniform , we will see below that the important characteristics of the latitudinal distribution in the nebula are not compromised by these minor effects .    to calculate various quantities as functions of latitude ,",
    "the outer shell was approximated as a series of adjacent loops or tori centered on the polar axis of the nebula ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the mass for each representative latitudinal loop is given by 2@xmath32 ( @xmath33)(2@xmath34r@xmath35 ) , where r@xmath35=r@xmath35(@xmath36 ) is the horizontal radius of each torus measured from the polar axis ( parallel to the equator ) , and 2@xmath37 is the thickness of the torus , roughly equal to the overall shell thickness of @xmath10600 au ( the extra factor of 2 accounts for the mass in both polar lobes ) . following the assumption of constant shell thickness and uniform density , however , the fraction of the total mass at each latitude @xmath38(@xmath36)=m(@xmath36)/@xmath39m(@xmath36 ) is simply proportional to r@xmath35 .",
    "this quantity is plotted in figure 5b , and avoids the uncertainty in the absolute physical density , shell thickness ( as long as it is constant ) , and total mass .",
    "the fraction of the total kinetic energy at each latitude @xmath40(@xmath36)=m(@xmath36)@xmath16(@xmath36)@xmath41/@xmath39[m(@xmath36)@xmath16(@xmath36)@xmath41 ] in figure 5c is calculated for each torus from its value of @xmath38(@xmath36 ) and its radial expansion speed .",
    "these rings were regularly spaced along the surface of the nebula ( fig .",
    "6 ) , but not spaced regularly in latitude . therefore , before plotting in figure 5 , the values for @xmath38(@xmath36 ) and @xmath40(@xmath36 ) were rebinned in latitude intervals of 5 .",
    "figure 5b indicates that most mass lost during the great eruption was aimed to high latitudes .",
    "only 25% of the total homunculus mass was ejected at @xmath43 , with the remaining 75% ejected between 45  and the pole .",
    "the latitudinal distribution of the ejecta s kinetic energy is even more extreme , with almost all the mechanical energy ( @xmath1094% ) escaping between 45  and the pole .",
    "the efficiency of imparting mechanical energy to the ejecta seems to peak at latitudes around 60 - 65 , while the peak mass loss occurs around 5060 .    for comparison ,",
    "the latitudinal distribution of mass and kinetic energy for a uniform spherical shell is shown by the dotted curves in figure 5 , while figure 7 shows the mass and kinetic energy per solid angle ( so that a spherical shell is a horizontal line ) .",
    "the differences between a spherical shell and the homunculus are striking .",
    "this latitudinal behavior strongly refutes the idea that a bipolar nebula like the homunculus was caused by an otherwise spherical explosion or wind that is simply pinched by a pre - existing circumstellar torus , because in that case we would expect to see more mass at low latitudes ( see also dwarkadas & balick 1998 and soker 2001 ) .",
    "likewise , the mass loss during the great eruption could not have been redirected toward the poles by deflection from its companion star , because the amount of kinetic energy in the polar ejecta is greater than the binding energy of the current putative binary system , and more than three orders of magnitude greater than the available energy in the companion s wind during the eruption .",
    "instead , the concentration of mass at high latitudes suggests that the original explosion itself directed the mass and momentum toward the poles .",
    "an alternative way to express same result is that perhaps much of the mass that would have been ejected at 040  failed to reach escape velocities and fell back onto the star . in any case , having the majority of the mass  a significant fraction of the total mass of the star  lost at polar latitudes will effect the star s angular momentum evolution .",
    "a polar explosion will tend to take away less than its share of angular momentum , leaving the post - outburst star with higher angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "this is related to its presently - observed bipolar stellar wind ( smith et al .",
    "additionally , after ejecting its own massive lbv nebula , there is evidence that ag carinae is also left as a rapid rotator ( groh et al .",
    "ultimately , without a circumstellar torus or deflection by a companion , the bipolar shape must come from rapid rotation of the primary star ; in that view the role of a companion star is relegated to helping to spin up the primary star through tidal friction during repeated periastron passes ( e.g. , smith et al.2003a ) .",
    "if the mass loss is driven by radiation , then gravity darkening on a rapidly rotating star will tend to drive most of the mass flux toward high latitudes ( e.g. , owocki et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; owocki & gayley 1997 ; owocki 2003 ) , providing a possible explanation for the polar mass concentration .",
    "however , it remains to be seen if even a continuum - driven wind can fuel the required mass loss ( owocki et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the latitudinal mass distribution has some interesting connections with other famous bipolar nebulae , especially the circumstellar nebula around sn1987a .",
    "both @xmath0 car and sn1987a have nebulae with equatorial and bipolar mass loss , but the two polar rings around sn1987a are particularly vexing . in the homunculus of @xmath0 car , we see that most of the mass outflow was concentrated toward intermediate latitudes around 6570 .",
    "one can imagine that if the mechanism that produced this mass concentration were pushed to some extreme limit , it might produce a pair of rings as it flowed out from the star . while energy arguments rule out bipolar shaping by a companion star in an eccentric 5.5 yr orbit that survives as the putative binary system seen in @xmath0 car today ( see above ) ,",
    "a more exotic model where the 1843 great eruption involved the merger of a tight binary system is admittedly more difficult to reject . in fact , a recent theoretical study of a merger scenario for the progenitor of sn1987a found that most of the mass loss is directed toward mid latitudes , with a significant deficit of mass loss near the equator ( morris & podsiadlowski 2005 ) .",
    "on the other hand , if one wishes to explain @xmath0 car s great eruption as a merger of two massive stars , then it is a mystery why the similar eruption of p cygni in 1600 a.d .",
    "( see humphreys et al .",
    "1999 ) ejected a spherical shell ( smith & hartigan 2006 ) and apparently did not leave that star as a rapid rotator .",
    "finally , an important caveat is needed . the notorious equatorial skirt of @xmath0 carinae  to be discussed in  7  is not detected in near - ir h@xmath1 emission , presumably because molecules simply can not survive or never formed there .",
    "this equatorial spray of ejecta seen in images is quite extensive and reaches large radii from the star , comparable to some parts of the polar lobes .",
    "thus , one should expect that the true velocity , mass , and energy distributions in figure 5 would be modified with a spike at @xmath36=0 .",
    "the magnitude of this equatorial spike in the mass distribution is not known .",
    "judging by the general absence of these equatorial features in thermal - ir images ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ) , however , the skirt likely contains less than @xmath100.5 m@xmath5 .",
    "a crude estimate of the expected mass density in the h@xmath1 shell can be made from the total mass of the homunculus and the volume occupied by the thin h@xmath1 skin .",
    "the h@xmath1 skin corresponds to the cool 140 k dust component that occupies the outer shell seen in thermal - ir images , which smith et al .",
    "( 2003b ) estimate to contain at least 11 m@xmath5 .",
    "this 11 m@xmath5 contains about 90% of the total mass in the homunculus , but its actual value depends on the highly uncertain gas : dust mass ratio , assumed to be 100 . as noted by smith et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , this is most likely a lower limit to the mass , since the ejecta of @xmath0 car are depleted of important grain constituents like c and o , and much of the fe is evidently in the gas phase as re - enforced by the spectra presented in this paper .",
    "therefore , the density derived below will also be a lower limit .",
    "the total volume of the model h@xmath1 skin in figure 6 is v@xmath44=4.6@xmath1110@xmath45 ( r/300 au)@xmath41 @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the equivalent pure atomic hydrogen density in the h@xmath1 skin is given by    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the proton mass and 2@xmath37=600 au is the assumed thickness of the h@xmath1 skin .",
    "two points need to be stressed : 1 ) @xmath49@xmath153@xmath1110@xmath12 @xmath8 is a lower limit because the total mass estimate is a lower limit ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ) and because parts of the shell are thinner than adopted here , and 2 ) this is an _ average _ density , so densities above 10@xmath50 @xmath8 may be present in clumps even if the total mass estimate is accurate",
    ".    the assumption of constant average density throughout the h@xmath1 skin may be optimistic , of course , but given the very thin side walls of the homunculus lobes , the latitudinal mass trend in figure 7 could only be erased ( flattened ) if the density were of order 10@xmath51 @xmath8 or more .",
    "corresponding column densities would be @xmath5210@xmath53 @xmath54 , which would contradict the fact that the side walls of the polar lobes are more optically thin than the caps ( e.g. , davidson et al .",
    "2001 ; allen & hillier 1993 ) .",
    "such high column densities would also contradict the much lower value of @xmath521.5@xmath1110@xmath55 @xmath54 from scattered hard x - rays in the homunculus ( corcoran et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "similar values of @xmath5610@xmath50 @xmath8 have been derived by gull et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from uv absorption along our sightline to the star in the lowest ionization species at a radial velocity of 513 km s@xmath18 .",
    "this rough agreement with the density value quoted here gives independent confirmation of the very high mass estimate for the homunculus of more than 10 m@xmath5 ( smith et al .",
    "in fact , the volume of the h@xmath1 shell derived from phoenix spectra and the higher density derived independently by gull et al .  would favor an even higher mass for the homunculus of perhaps @xmath1020 m@xmath5 .",
    "while the shape , orientation , and density structure of the polar lobes seem understandable in the framework of the double - shell structure discussed here , the morphology of the messy equatorial skirt is still perplexing . however , the new phoenix spectra from gemini south shed some light on this mystery .",
    "one important clue is that the material in the extended equatorial skirt shows no detectable infrared h@xmath1 emission , despite residing at large radii where it should be shielded by dense dusty structures in the core region .",
    "the features in the equatorial skirt , while prominent in reflected light at visual wavelengths ( morse et al.1998 ; duschl et al .",
    "1995 ) , have weak emission in the thermal - ir ( smith et al .",
    "these facts suggest that the equatorial disk has much lower density than the walls of the lobes , and so dust and molecule formation was less efficient there in the decades after the great eruption .",
    "in fact , some equatorial features seem to be optical illusions ( davidson et al .  2001 ) .",
    "thus , the equatorial skirt contains only a small fraction of the total mass in the homunculus ; probably @xmath40.5 m@xmath5 , as noted above .    the spatial and kinematic structure in high - resolution spectra of h@xmath1",
    "give the first clear picture of the shape and structure of the homunculus at low latitudes near equator where the two polar lobes meet .",
    "this region is hidden in images and optical spectra due to obscuration from the foreground lobe , and the [ fe  ii ] emission there is very confusing due to the little homunculus ( ishibashi et al .",

    "( 2002 ) proposed that they mark a distorted and disrupted torus or ring where the two polar lobes of the homunculus meet at the equator .",
    "in this view , the complex structures are a result of lower - density structures getting swept back by the post eruption stellar wind , and higher density clumps resisting that expansion .",
    "2 ) chesneau et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed the existence of a new structure called the `` butterfly nebula '' , which was a dusty bipolar nebula different from the little homunculus , and which had the dust reaching back toward the star along the polar axis .",
    "the new h@xmath1 spectra distinguish clearly between these two hypotheses .",
    "figure 8 demonstrates the correspondence between the structures seen in a high - resolution map of the warm dust column density near the star from smith et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and the spatial and kinematic structure of h@xmath1 emission in spectra .",
    "where the thin h@xmath1 walls of the homunculus meet at the equator , they do not reach all the way in to the star , but instead leave a gap in the apparent distribution of h@xmath1 along the slit .",
    "this gap is slightly different at each slit position , and is noted in each spectral image .",
    "each of these gaps is superposed on top of the ir continuum image , where we see that indeed , the spatial limits of h@xmath1 emission correspond nicely to the empty interior of the so - called `` butterfly nebula '' or torus .",
    "the agreement between h@xmath1 in the walls of the homunculus and the dust structures prove that this really is an equatorial torus or ring where the polar lobes meet at the equator , rather than the separate nebular structure proposed by chesneau et al .",
    "the toroidal interpretation also gives a more natural explanation for the deficit of ir emission within its boundaries ( chesneau et al .",
    "no kinematic evidence for the putative butterfly structure is seen in spectra , and the dust structures are not coincident with the little homunculus either ( fig.8 ) . the question then is : if these structures represent parts of an equatorial torus or ring , why does it exhibit such prominent azimuthal asymmetry ( clumps , arcs , etc . ) , while the rest of the h@xmath1-emitting portions of the homunculus , by comparison , show such well - ordered axisymmetric structure ?",
    "the strange clumps and arcs in this equatorial dust structure  and the lack of similar features in the polar lobes  can be understood as follows ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) : in the 160 yr since the homunculus was ejected in the great eruption , it has been followed by the post - eruption stellar wind .",
    "at the poles , the speed for the bulk of the post eruption wind is about 600 km s@xmath18 ( traced by the deepest part of the h@xmath57 p cygni absorption ; smith et al .",
    "2003a ) , which is almost identical to the expansion speed of the homunculus ( fig 5a ) .",
    "with such a small @xmath58 , we expect little or no hydrodynamic influence from the wind .",
    "the equator presents a very different story .",
    "although the present - day stellar wind is bipolar , it appears to maintain relatively high wind speeds of @xmath10400 km s@xmath18 at the equator ( smith et al .",
    "2003a ) , whereas the pinched waist of the homunculus seen in h@xmath1 has very slow velocities of only a few dozen km s@xmath18 .",
    "this large value of @xmath58 right at the equator should lead to rayleigh - taylor or nonlinear thin - shell instabilities ( vishniac 1994 ) in the torus where the polar lobes meet , much like any other dense ejecta shell followed by a faster wind ( e.g. , garcia - segura et al .",
    "the homunculus is inherently clumpy at all latitudes , perhaps even more so at the equator ( ud doula & owocki 2002 ) .",
    "since the ram pressure of the incident wind depends on ( @xmath58)@xmath41 , the post - eruption wind is most influential at the equator .",
    "any clumps in this ring will resist the ram pressure of the wind more than the less dense regions between them .",
    "the inter - clump sections of the torus would be swept back , leading to structures akin to dust pillars in h  ii regions . in other words ,",
    "the values in the first row of table 1 are azimuthally dependent .",
    "this is essentially a more extreme version of the rayleigh - taylor instabilities that are thought to have led to the early development of hot spots in the famous equatorial ring around sn1987a ( e.g. , michael et al .  1998 ) .    in the inter - clump regions of the torus , where the wind pushes outward",
    ", there may be an interesting link to the unusual structures seen in @xmath0 car s equatorial skirt .",

    ", the stellar wind or ejecta from the great eruption or the 1890 eruption may even have broken through the homunculus .",

    "the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the relative spatio - kinematic structure of infrared h@xmath1 and [ fe  ii ] emission gives an independent confirmation of the double - shell structure for the polar lobes of the homunculus proposed on the basis of thermal - ir images ( smith et al .",
    "the inner [ fe  ii ] layer corresponds to the warmer ( 200 k ) inner dust layer that traces only about 10% of the mass of the homunculus , while the outer h@xmath1 skin traces the coolest dust component ( 140 k ) that contains the remaining 90% of the nebular mass .",
    "the high - resolution spectra of h@xmath1 show for the first time how thin and surprisingly smooth the outer molecular skin of the homunculus is .",
    "if the h@xmath1 skin s @xmath3r / r traces @xmath3t / t of the mass ejection , then the most important mass - loss phase during the eruption is constrained to be about 5 yr or less .",
    "the corresponding mass - loss rate is so high that the mechanical luminosity would have greatly exceeded the radiative luminosity at that time , implying that the great eruption was more of an explosion than a wind .      \\4 .",
    "since h@xmath1 emission traces most of the mass in the homunculus as well as the dominant dust scattering layer seen as a reflection nebula in images , h@xmath1 spectra give the first definitive picture of the 3d shape of the homunculus , which is given in table 1 .",
    "earlier estimates of the shape and orientation traced the inner [ fe  ii]-emitting layer , which has a different size and structure .",
    "deviations from a smooth symmetric shape are minor  generally comparable to the thickness of the lobes .",
    "the redshifted nw lobe appears more symmetric than the approaching se lobe , which shows more prominent dents and corrugations .",
    "the h@xmath1 distribution yields our first estimate of the latitudinal dependence of the velocity , mass loss , and kinetic energy of the great eruption .",
    "about 75% of the mass and more than 90% of the mechanical energy was released at latitudes between 45  and the pole .",
    "this latitudinal mass distribution rules - out a model where the bipolar shape of the nebula arises from an otherwise spherical explosion being constricted by a pre - existing circumstellar torus . the kinetic energy of the polar ejecta rule out a model where the ejecta were deflected toward the poles by a companion star , because the putative companion could not have supplied the required energy .",
    "this means that the ejecta were directed toward the poles by the explosion itself .",
    "a merger event is not as easy to rule out .",
    ". the spatio - kinematic structure of h@xmath1 emission at the pinched waist of the nebula helps explain the unusual and complex structures seen in high - resolution ir images as an equatorial torus disrupted by the post - eruption wind .",

    "<S> high resolution long - slit spectra obtained with the phoenix spectrograph on gemini south provide our most accurate probe of the three dimensional structure of the homunculus nebula around @xmath0  carinae . </S>",
    "<S> the new near - infrared spectra dramatically confirm the double - shell structure inferred previously from thermal dust emission , resolving the nebula into a very thin outer shell seen in h@xmath1 @xmath221218 , and a warmer , thicker inner layer seen in [ fe  ii ] @xmath216435 . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkably thin and uniform h@xmath1 skin has @xmath3r / r of only a few per cent at the poles , hinting that the most important mass loss during the 19th century eruption may have had a very short duration of @xmath45 yr . </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath1 emission traces the majority of the more than 10 m@xmath5 of material in the nebula , and has an average density of order @xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this emission , in turn , yields our first definitive picture of the exact shape of the nebula , plus a distance of 2350@xmath950 pc and an inclination angle of @xmath1041  ( the polar axis is tilted 49  from the plane of the sky ) . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the h@xmath1 emission provides the first measure of the latitude dependence of the speed , mass loss , and kinetic energy associated with @xmath0  car s 19th century explosion . </S>",
    "<S> almost 75% of the total mass and more than 90% of the kinetic energy in the ejecta were released at high latitudes between 45  and the polar axis . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out a model for the bipolar shape wherein an otherwise spherical explosion was pinched at the waist by a circumstellar torus . </S>",
    "<S> also , the ejecta could not have been deflected toward polar trajectories by a companion star , since the kinetic energy of the polar ejecta is greater than the binding energy of the putative binary system . </S>",
    "<S> instead , most of the mass appears to have been directed poleward by the explosion itself  or the star failed to launch material from low latitudes , which would have important consequences for the angular momentum evolution of the star . in any case , comparing h@xmath1 and [ fe  ii ] emission resolves some puzzles about structure noted in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> emission also provides our first reliable picture of the critical innermost waist of the homunculus , yielding clues to the observed morphology of the core and the more extended equatorial debris . </S>"
