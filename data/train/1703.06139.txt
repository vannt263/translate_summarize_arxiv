    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are jansky - level millisecond duration transient events at @xmath4 ghz frequencies of unknown physical origin discovered in pulsar surveys @xcite .",

    "very recently , the location of one of these bursts frb 121102 , a repeater , has been determined to an accuracy of @xmath8 by interferometry with the jansky very large array @xcite .",
    "this frb is found to be associated with a dwarf star - forming host galaxy at redshift z = 0.19273 @xcite .",
    "the frb is also associated with a persistent radio source @xcite , and their separation is further pinned down to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 in physical distance ) by the european vlbi network @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that the distance of frb 121102 is @xmath11 gpc considering that many observational evidences had already suggested that frbs are at cosmological distances ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a brief review ) .",
    "first of all , their dispersion measures ( the column density of free electrons along the line of sight @xmath12 ) are much larger than the contribution from the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the milky way by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "second , if the dm is mostly contributed by an ionized nebula with electron temperature @xmath13 , then in order to avoid free - free absorption of ghz waves the size of the nebula must be larger than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the strength of h@xmath15 and uv continuum flux limits combined with the free - free absorption argument suggest that at least the `` lorimer burst '' frb 010724 is at a distance @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "confirmation of the cosmological origin means that frbs are very energetic events .",
    "if the frb sources are isotropic ( the effect of anisotropy will be included later on ) , then the energy release is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fluence , @xmath19 is the luminosity distance and @xmath20 is the width of the frb spectrum . if frb radiation is incoherent , for burst duration @xmath21 , the area of the emitting region in the transverse direction  for a source with sub - relativistic speed  is @xmath22 , so the brightness temperature is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the peak specific flux , @xmath25 is the angular diameter distance ( @xmath26 cm ) , @xmath27 is the lab - frame frequency , @xmath28 is speed of light , and @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant ; we use the convenient notation @xmath30 throughout the paper . note that if the source is moving toward the earth at lorentz factor @xmath31 , then @xmath32 ( the comoving frame temperature ) is smaller by a factor of @xmath33 than estimated in equation ( [ tb ] ) . for any reasonable lorentz factor ,",
    "the brightness temperature exceeds the compton catastrophe limit of @xmath34 k. this means that frb radiation must be coherent and the emitting particles relativistic , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "regarding the nature of frbs , the major unknowns are their progenitors and radiation mechanism .",
    "many progenitor models have been proposed , including : collapsing neutron stars , neutron star or white dwarf mergers @xcite , magnetar bursts @xcite , supergiant pulses from young pulsars @xcite , ( galactic ) flaring stars @xcite , relativistic jets running into clouds @xcite , asteroids colliding with neutron stars @xcite , close neutron star - white dwarf binaries @xcite , lightning in the neutron star magnetosphere @xcite , and plasma stream sweeping across the neutron star magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "these works are only based on considerations of energetics and timescales , and the authors simply _ assumed _ that ( a fraction of ) the free energy available in the system is radiated away at ghz frequencies by coherent charge `` patches '' via e.g. curvature or synchrotron processes .",
    "however , the properties of the emitting particles / plasma and conditions for coherent emission have not been discussed in detail and will be the focus of this paper .",
    "@xcite used coherent curvature radiation to explain both frbs and the mjy shot pulses from the crab pulsar , but the formation and stability of the relativistic near neutral coherent patches ; particles of positive and negative charges are moving in the same direction .",
    "the basic reason for requiring an extremely small fractional charge is that the energy of frb electromagnetic waves comes from particles initial kinetic energy in the model of @xcite .",
    "the cooling time is much shorter than 1 ns ( see  3 ) unless an amount of net charge @xmath35 is associated with kinetic energy @xmath36 .",
    "another reason for quasi - neutrality is the electrostatic repulsion . ] in their model were not discussed .",
    "@xcite derived the general conditions for synchrotron maser emission ; ghz synchrotron emission requires weak ( and ordered ) magnetic field ( @xmath37 g for electrons and @xmath38 g for protons ) which can be found at distances @xmath39 from a neutron star for a dipole field configuration @xmath40 ; where @xmath31 is the lorentz factor of particles perpendicular to the b - field .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the energy requirement for frbs may be hard to satisfy for the synchrotron maser model if frbs are at cosmological distances . in an earlier paper , @xcite proposed that synchrotron maser emission may be produced when a magneto - hydrodynamic wave generated in a magnetar giant flare interacts with the surrounding pulsar wind nebula at a distance of @xmath41 ( here @xmath42 ) .",
    "the common problem of @xcite and @xcite models is that they did not discuss how the particle distribution ( population inversion ) for efficient maser emission can be achieved .",
    "most frbs models are based on neutron stars ( ns ) , which could naturally explain their short durations , large energy requirement , ordered magnetic field ( hereafter b - field ) needed for coherent emission , and repetitions with intervals between @xmath43 to @xmath44 seconds ( the only repeater so far is frb 121102 , but others may also be repeating , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we use general physical considerations to show that the b - field in the frb source plasma should be @xmath45 and hence frbs are most likely to be produced in the magnetosphere of a ns or stellar - mass black hole .",
    "we also note that the persistent radio source near frb 121102 is consistent with being a supernova remnant ( snr ) energized by a young ns / magnetar @xcite , although the possibility of an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "much of the work presented in this paper was done in the summer of 2016 , but the writing up of the paper took a long time due to some pressing matter .",
    "we have made every effort to cite papers related to this work that have been published in the meantime in this fast developing field .    in  2 , we provide estimates for the size of the source region , and the strength of the electric field associated with the frb radiation at the source . in  3 , we show that coherent curvature radiation in neutron star magnetosphere can explain the frb properties , and we also provide a number of arguments to show that the b - field strength should be @xmath46 g. some predictions of this model are discussed in  4 , and a summary of the main results are provided in  5 .",
    "we provide a broad - brush picture of the frb source in this section based on general physics considerations .    considering that the frb radiation is coherent",
    ", the size of the source along the line of sight can not be larger than the wavelength ( @xmath47 ) of the radiation we observe .",
    "if the source is moving toward us with a lorentz factor @xmath31 , the frequency in the source frame is smaller than in the lab frame by a factor @xmath31 , and the transverse size corresponding to the wavelength is @xmath48",
    ". since particle velocities are @xmath49 , separation of @xmath47 along the line of sight can be maintained over a lab - frame time @xmath50 . the transverse source size is often taken to be @xmath51 .",
    "however , this need not be the case . the transverse size can be larger than @xmath48 by factor @xmath52 and still coherence can be maintained ; @xmath53 .",
    "this is because the time delay between the arrival of photons at the observer from the opposite ends of the source in the transverse direction @xmath54 is smaller than @xmath55 provided that @xmath56 $ ] ; where @xmath57 is the angular diameter distance to the source , and @xmath58 is the distance between the source and the _ trigger point _  located behind the source  from which the signal originates and propagates outward and triggers different points in the source to start radiating . for frbs at distances @xmath59 ,",
    "the requirement on @xmath60 is @xmath61 moreover , the shape of the coherent patch in the transverse direction is unknown . in the following ,",
    "we take the area of the coherent patch in the transverse direction to be @xmath62 where @xmath63 contains two multiplication factors @xmath64 and @xmath65 corresponding to the directions of the two principal axes in the transverse plane .",
    "thus , the maximum coherent volume in the lab frame is @xmath66 and in the comoving frame @xmath67 this coherent patch contributes to the frb radiation for a time duration of order @xmath68 in the observer s frame , during which the source has traveled a distance @xmath69 ( in the lab frame ) toward the observer .",
    "the patch turns off after this time and another patch lights up so that the intrinsic frb duration is much longer than @xmath70 .",
    "there could be more than one coherent patches ( @xmath71 ) adding up incoherently , and a continuous plasma flow could produce coherent radiation for a duration longer than @xmath70 ; two sources that are separated by a distance larger than the size of a coherent zone are treated as two independent patches , and even within a coherent zone we can have multiple patches if the radiation they produce is not in phase . if the same source produces coherent radiation continuously for a time duration longer than @xmath70 ( in observer s frame ) , then we tag it as a different source after time interval @xmath70 and yet another source after @xmath72 and so on .",
    "the total isotropic equivalent of energy release for frbs is @xmath73 erg and the isotropic equivalent luminosity is @xmath74 erg s@xmath75 ( for a cosmological distance of @xmath76 cm ) . in the far field ( fraunhofer diffraction )",
    "limit , the solid angle within which electromagnetic ( em ) waves add up coherently is , the beaming solid angle @xmath77 . equation ( [ eq:15 ] ) is only correct in the limit @xmath78 and @xmath79 . for smaller @xmath60",
    "s , the energy density associated with electromagnetic waves is larger than our current , conservative , estimate , because more energy is produced in a smaller coherent volume . ]",
    "@xmath80 if there are @xmath71 distinct coherent patches , each of volume @xmath81 , contributing to the total observed frb flux _ at any given time _ , the beaming corrected total energy is @xmath82 the average lab - frame energy density in em waves in the radiating plasma is @xmath83 which is of order 10@xmath84 erg @xmath85 . therefore , the electric and magnetic field strengths associated with this em wave energy density are @xmath86 where the b - field strength is in gauss .",
    "the electric field is very strong in the sense that @xmath87 .",
    "thus , unless this field is almost exactly perpendicular to the local magnetic field it will accelerate electrons to highly relativistic speeds and drain the energy out of the frb radiation .",
    "since all the photons from a patch must be traveling in nearly the same direction and in phase in order that their fields add coherently , we therefore infer that the electric and magnetic fields associated with the observed frb radiation calculated above is in a direction roughly perpendicular to the patch s velocity vector .",
    "guided by general considerations of the last section that the b - field in the region where the observed radio photons from frbs are produced is large , we restrict ourselves to the magnetosphere of a neutron star or a stellar - mass black hole .",
    "the curvature radiation  radiation produced when charged particles stream along curved b - field lines  is an efficient way in these conditions to produce large coherent radiation . in this section",
    ", we describe a detailed curvature radiation model that can reproduce observed frb properties without any fine tuning of parameters .",
    "let us consider an electron moving with lorentz factor @xmath31 along a b - field line of local curvature radius @xmath88 .",
    "due to its acceleration along the b - field curvature , the electron produces em waves at frequency @xmath89 and the power radiated is @xmath90 the second expression for @xmath91 is obtained by expressing @xmath31 in terms of @xmath92 using equation ( [ nu_r ] ) , i.e. @xmath93    the electron s radiation is beamed in the forward direction within a cone of angle @xmath94 , and the pulse time in the observer frame is smaller than the lab - frame time by a factor @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the isotropic luminosity due to one electron , in the observer frame , is given by @xmath96    since we are considering radiation from a coherent patch where all electrons are moving with almost exactly the same velocity ( @xmath31 ) and streaming along nearly parallel b - field lines , we can take the patch to be moving with a lorentz factor @xmath31 , and electrons in the patch s comoving frame to be essentially at rest .",
    "let us consider that the electron density in the comoving frame is @xmath97 , which we express in terms of the goldreich - julian ( gj ) density @xmath98 @xcite : @xmath99 where @xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the radius , rotation period and surface b - field strength of a neutron star , and @xmath104 is the distance from the coherent patch to the center of the star .",
    "the spin down time for the neutron star due to dipole radiation is @xmath105 so if the object underlying frbs is a neutron star with b - field strength @xmath106 g , then it can produce radio bursts for only a relatively short period of time of order a few hundred years .",
    "we note that the surface b - field @xmath103 of the frb progenitor star may not be of dipole configuration ; higher order multipole components give a smaller spin down power and hence a longer spin down time .    as our fiducial parameter ,",
    "we take @xmath107 and use @xmath108 hereafter , so the total number of electrons in the patch that are radiating coherently is @xmath109    the isotropic equivalent luminosity , in the observer frame , due to @xmath110 coherent patches ( each containing @xmath111 electrons ) can be calculated using equations ( [ dl_iso ] ) & ( [ ntot ] ) @xmath112 or @xmath113 in arriving at the above equation we made use of equation ( [ gam ] ) .",

    "the beaming corrected luminosity in the lab frame is @xmath118 @xmath119 the factor in the numerator on the rhs of equation ( [ l_lab1 ] ) is the solid angle of the radiation beam from the patch divided by @xmath120 , and the factor in the denominator is the ratio of the observer frame and lab frame times .",
    "the total kinetic energy of electrons in all radiating patches in the lab frame is @xmath121 combining equations ( [ l_lab2 ] ) & ( [ e_e_tot ] ) , we find the cooling time of electrons in the lab frame @xmath122 which is much shorter ( by a factor @xmath123 ) than the lab frame time duration ( @xmath124 ) over which the patch is radiating .",
    "this requires that there is an electric field parallel to the b - field that can accelerate electrons and sustain their lorentz factor at @xmath31 for the time duration of @xmath125 .",
    "the required electric field in the lab frame is given by @xmath126 we can express the electric field in terms of the frb luminosity using equation ( [ liso2 ] ) @xmath127 this field , parallel to the b - field , is of the same order as the perpendicular electric field associated with the frb radio emission ( equation [ e_em ] ) .",
    "the radiation can be sustained for a duration longer than @xmath70 in the observer s frame provided that the electric field is maintained by some process for longer than @xmath124 ( lab frame ) such as an ongoing reconnection of b - field . in ",
    "[ current - sheet ] , we provide a possible magnetic reconnection geometry in which such a parallel electric field can be maintained .",
    "the electric current associated with the motion of electrons in the volume @xmath128 is @xmath129 .",
    "the number density of particles with positive charge is nearly the same as the electron number density in order that the plasma is charge neutral . and",
    "since these positively charged particles are accelerated by the electric field in opposite direction to the electrons , the total current in the region is @xmath130 .",
    "thus , the b - field generated by the current inside the patch is @xmath131 or @xmath132    this induced b - field is in the direction perpendicular to the primary b - field ( @xmath133 ) , and the induced field lines are closed curves that lie in planes normal to @xmath133 .",
    "thus the superposition of the two fields  @xmath134 & @xmath133  will point in different directions at different locations in the source .",
    "particles are stuck in the lowest landau state , as shown later , and therefore their motion is along b - field lines . in order for these particles to produce coherent radiation",
    "their velocity vectors should be nearly parallel . to be more precise",
    ", the angle between the velocity vectors for different particles should not be larger than @xmath94 .",
    "this constraint provides a lower limit on the strength of the original b - field @xmath103 in the region : @xmath135    it is unphysical that a large number of patches would turn on _ simultaneously _ on a timescale of @xmath136 ns , so we expect that @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , @xmath52 is at most of order unity , as been constrained in ",
    "[ sec : general ] ( eq .",
    "[ eq:16 ] ) .",

    "the main goal is to ascertain whether radio waves can propagate through this media without suffering excessive absorption , and to provide a constraint on the particle density in the region where frb radiation is produced .",
    "we show below that wave absorption is small as long as the particle number density ( @xmath139 ) is smaller than 10@xmath140 @xmath85 , which is about @xmath141 times the gj density , i.e. @xmath142 ( note that @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) .",

    "however , the contribution of the magnetosphere to the observed dm value of frbs is negligible .",
    "this is due to the fact that the _ effective plasma frequency _ in the presence of a strong b - field is reduced by a factor of @xmath156 , and thus the contribution to the dm from the frb source region is @xmath157 pc @xmath85 .",

    "the standard result for free - free absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "frb event rate should decrease with increasing frequency roughly as , and the combined angular size of all the beams in case there are multiple beams associated with a source .",
    "the frb rate @xmath437 should be taken as a rough estimate . ]",
    "@xmath438 , or perhaps more steeply , because of possible enhancement to the beaming associated with the transverse source size .",
    "the intrinsic durations of frbs at frequencies much larger than ghz may be of the same order as ghz - frbs provided that there are a large number of independent beams ( each of angular size @xmath94 ) that contribute to the total duration . on the other hand , if the radiation is produced by a single beam sweeping across the observer line of sight  which is the most conservative possibility for these transients  then the observed duration at higher frequencies would be smaller than a few ms since the higher frequency radiation is produced by electrons with larger lorentz factors .",
    "the luminosity function of frbs in a fixed frequency band should be broad since @xmath439 .",
    "this might be the reason for the large flux variations ( by at least an order of magnitude ) observed for the different outbursts of the repeating frb 121102 @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic coherent radiation luminosity decreases with decreasing frequency , and the observed pulse width increases rapidly at lower frequencies due to wave scattering ( roughly as @xmath440 , but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by turbulence in the ism / igm and dm smearing ( @xmath441 ) .",
    "these effects cause the observed flux to decrease sharply at lower frequencies . to make matters worse , lower frequency waves may have difficulty in getting out of the supernova ejecta as a result of free - free absorption .",
    "so there is likely to be a low frequency cut - off to the frb observations which might be of order a few hundred mhz .",
    "the very high brightness temperature of frbs suggest that the radiation process is coherent , which means that the comoving source size can not be larger than the comoving - frame wavelength @xmath442 of the radiation we observe .",
    "thus , the electric field associated with radiation at the source is of order 10@xmath1 esu ( and the b - field is 10@xmath1 g ) .",
    "furthermore we show that the curvature radiation can account for the observed frb properties without any need for fine tuning .",
    "the current associated with charged particles motion along field lines produces transverse b - field ( with roughly cylindrical shaped field lines ) that is sufficiently strong to perturb particle trajectories and destroy coherence unless the primary field is @xmath46 g ( see eq .",
    "[ b0-lim ] ) .",
    "the strong b - field also ensures that electrons stay in the ground state of landau levels in spite of several strong perturbations that are present in the source region that otherwise would excite particles to higher landau level and destroy coherence .",
    "a particle density of @xmath443 @xmath85 ( in lab frame ) is sufficient to account for the observed isotropic equivalent frb luminosity 10@xmath444 erg s@xmath75 ; the total number of charged particles in one coherent patch with lorentz factors @xmath445 is of order 10@xmath446 ; a coherent patch produces radiation for @xmath447 ns , and therefore the total number of particles responsible for a typical frb transient is @xmath448 , and the mass of this matter is about a kg for an electron - positron plasma .",
    "however , because the particles are radiating in phase , their radiative cooling time is extremely small  of order 10@xmath449 s or six orders of magnitude smaller than the wave period  unless there is a powerful acceleration mechanism that balances the radiative losses and maintains the particle speed .",
    "an electric field of strength @xmath450 esu , parallel to the primary b - field , is the required mechanism to sustain the particle motion for at least the lab - frame travel time ( @xmath451 ) over which ghz em waves are produced .",
    "such an electric field could be produced during forced magnetic reconnection near the surface of a magnetar .",
    "this could also explain why we see the bursts repeat episodically .",
    "the total energy release in these bursts , corrected for beaming , is estimated to be of order @xmath2 ergs , whereas the total energy in the b - field is at least @xmath452 ergs .",
    "the intrinsic durations of some frbs may be much longer than the light - crossing time of a ns .",
    "if this is true , the process that drives the magnetic reconnection should be relatively `` slow '' .",
    "one possible scenario is that b - field flux emerges from below the ns surface due to buoyancy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and then reconnects with pre - existing b - field in the magnetosphere .",
    "another possibility is the slow movement of the ns crust where the fields are anchored .",
    "it is currently unclear what this process might be .",
    "according to the model we have described , the lorentz factor of electrons ( and hence the peak frequency of the spectrum ) , and the isotropic luminosity are dependent mainly on the thickness of the current sheet @xmath453 ( @xmath424 being the plasma frequency ) and the strength of the electric field parallel to the b - field , @xmath224 .",
    "these two parameters could have large variations among different bursts or at different locations of one burst .",
    "thus , according to the model we have described , the luminosity function for frbs should be very broad .",
    "also , the mechanism we have described should produce short duration bursts at frequencies much larger than 1 ghz ( up to @xmath454 hz ) .",
    "the rate of bursts , however , is predicted to decrease with increasing peak frequency because higher frequency photons require larger lorentz factor of particles or smaller curvature radius of b - field .",
    "the former is a much stronger effect , and the burst rate is expected to decrease with frequency at least as @xmath455 .",
    "there are several issues that we have not discussed in detail , which future works should address .",
    "in particular , studying the propagation of polarized waves through the ns magnetosphere and surrounding medium in the host galaxy may help our understanding of the odd spectrum of frbs and their polarization properties .",
    "the distortion of b - field lines , and reconnection for an extremely large magnetization parameter plasma ( @xmath456 ) are also topics that require separate investigations .",
