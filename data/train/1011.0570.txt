    "the first interest in ion specific effects dates back to the end of the 19th century , when franz hofmeister and his co - workers  @xcite measured the thermodynamic properties of protein precipitation in various salt solutions .",
    "they tested numerous salt species and found that the protein solubility properties can be arranged in a specific ionic order .",
    "this classification of cations and anions is known today as the _",
    "hofmeister series_. since then many other experiments demonstrated that ion - specific effects take place in a large variety of chemical and biological systems  @xcite .",
    "these experiments include measurement of surface tension at air / water interface @xcite , proteins stability @xcite , forces between charged surfaces such as mica or silica surfaces  @xcite , osmotic pressure in systems containing biological macromolecules @xcite and many more .",
    "noticeable efforts have been devoted over the years to understand the physical mechanisms that lead to ion - specific effects  @xcite .",
    "a typical problem is to obtain density profiles of ions near charged surfaces such as macromolecules , membranes and colloids or neutral dielectric interfaces ( _ e.g. , _ air / water interface ) , and use the profiles to calculate macroscopic quantities such as osmotic pressure and surface tension .    theoretical endeavors offer a variety of perspectives regarding the origin of the ion - specific effects .",
    "most recently , dispersion interactions  @xcite depending on the polarizability of the ions , have been proposed to furnish the missing link between ionic profiles and ion - specific interactions .",
    "these interactions add an additional term to the total ionic energy close to a non - charged dielectric interface .",
    "this term varies as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the distance of the ion from the surface , located at @xmath2 .",
    "the ion - specificity then emerges from a variation in the specific ion polarizability , leading to different values of the coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "apart from the dispersion interactions , ion - hydration interaction  @xcite has been suggested to lead to an effective short - range ion - specific interaction with the bounding surface .",
    "for example , an attractive potential of the ions to the surface in the shape of a square well , takes into account their larger affinity as compared to ion - water interaction .",
    "this attraction then boosts the concentration of the ions in the surface vicinity .    in a similar fashion but with an opposite effect , onsager and samaras dealt in their seminal work  @xcite with repulsive image charge interactions as a source of ionic depletion from a non - charged dielectric interface .",
    "image charge interaction is a short - range surface interaction , having an @xmath4 dependence , where @xmath5 is the debye screening length .",
    "this repulsive interaction becomes significant for air / water interfaces and is responsible for the increase of surface tension of saline solutions as compared with pure water .",
    "more recently , additional interactions have been proposed to augment the original onsager and samaras model , and offer an explanation to ion - specific surface tension of electrolyte solutions , in agreement with experiments  @xcite .    in another approach  @xcite it was suggested that surface charge density is a crucial parameter controlling ionic specificity .",
    "the density is determined by the net charge and specific volume ( i.e. , radii ) of the ions . for small ions ,",
    "the surface charge density can be large , leading to a strong attractive interaction with the polar water molecules .",
    "this results in a",
    " hard \" hydration shell with high energy cost of removing it .",
    "oppositely , for large ions , the surface charge density is smaller , and therefore , the energy cost of breaking the ion - water complex is lower , leading to a  soft \" hydration shell . due to the different energy costs of  hard \" and  soft \" hydration shells , it is favorable to have pairing where both cations and anions are either small or large .",
    "an interesting feature of this ionic pairing mechanism is a possible explanation of a reversal in the order of the hofmeister series , as observed in several experiments  @xcite .    besides the analytical approaches ,",
    "computer simulations gain much needed insight into the intricacies of the ionic specificity  @xcite , and are used to investigate various cross - interactions between the system components ( solutes , solvent and surfaces ) .",
    "computer simulations capture a very detailed microscopic picture as compared to continuum theories such as the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory and its extensions .",
    "however , they often lack the simplicity and predictive power of analytical models and their straightforward intuition .    from the current state of theoretical and experimental studies",
    ", it appears to be quite clear that ion - specific effects are due to the interplay between the ion - ion , ion - solvent and ion - surface interactions , taking into consideration both electrostatic and non - electrostatic interactions .",
    "however , it is still not well understood what are the important physical and chemical properties of the solutes and solvent that determine these specific interactions .",
    "the traditional pb theory accounts for electrostatic interactions on a mean - field level with well understood drawbacks and limitations @xcite .",
    "it neglects all ion - specific effects except for the ion valency , which means that it treats identically all ions of the same valency . apart from the electrostatic interactions",
    ", other non - electrostatic interactions can be added into the theory .",
    "this was done in the standard dlvo theory of colloid stability  @xcite , where the total interaction decomposes into a sum of the van der waals and electrostatic interactions .    in the present work",
    "we would like to suggest a phenomenological approach to treat different ionic species .",
    "our approach shares some of the simplicity of the pb theory , while taking into account the ionic specificity on a mean - field level .",
    "in particular , we focus on the effect the ions have on the local solution polarity as codified by its static dielectric function . the static dielectric function is treated as a spatially - dependent function @xmath6 , where the spatial dependence is given implicitly by the local ionic concentration , thus introducing ionic specificity in an implicit manner . in the next section we elaborate on the dependence of the dielectric constant on the ionic concentration and",
    "discuss its physical range . in section  [ model ]",
    ", we present a mean - field model that accounts for the effect of the ions on the dielectric constants .",
    "finally , results for density profiles and the inter - plate pressure are presented in sections  [ profile ] and [ pressure ] , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the static dielectric function of an electrolyte solution is generally found to be smaller than that of the pure solvent @xcite .",
    "this decrement of the dielectric constant has been attributed to various sources , which underly the changes in the dielectric response of the solution .",
    "we mention here two of the most important ones :    * _ ionic polarizability . _",
    "*  each ion in an aqueous solution creates a cavity and displaces one or several water molecules in this process .",

    "_ hydration shell .",
    "_ *  the gist of the dielectric decrement in aqueous electrolytes is connected with the structural modification of water molecules in the immediate proximity to the ion due to large electrostatic fields emanating from the dissolved ions  @xcite . by the action of these strong electrostatic fields ,",

    "the same effect would lead to an overall reduction of the total solution dielectric constant as a function of the ionic concentration .",
    "in addition to these primary mechanisms , there are other possible sources of the dielectric decrement such as excluded volume  @xcite and dynamical effects  @xcite that can have a noticeable contribution .    in numerous experimental studies",

    "this can be seen for the homologous series of xcl where x is the alkaline ion .",

    "we set up a phenomenological model based on a modification of the standard pb theory , which includes the effect of the counter - ion concentration @xmath17 on the local dielectric constant , in a consistent manner , via the local variation of @xmath17 in @xmath16 .",

    "their net charge induces an attractive interaction with the charged surface . on the other hand , the counter - ions effective dipole moment due to the concentration dependence of the dielectric",

    "the most pronounced effect is found for regime ( _ i _ ) and @xmath77 , where ions are strongly depleted from the charged surface due to the decrement of @xmath104 and the resulting penalty of electrostatic energy .",
    "this depletion results in a plateau of the ionic concentration profile close to the charged surface .",
    "we estimate the plateau thickness analytically and find that it is of the order of few angstroms . in regime (",
    "_ ii _ ) where @xmath179 , the effect of local changes of the dielectric constant is negligible comparing to the contribution that comes from the net charge of the ions .",
    "the profiles in this regime are characterized by an algebraic decay similarly to the standard pb theory . for @xmath180 in regime ( _ iii _ ) , the dielectric constant is increased nearby the surface , leading to a weaker attraction of the ions to the surface .",

    "the range of this additional effect persists up to a few nanometers . for @xmath185m@xmath12 ,",
    "the deviation is significant for separations smaller than @xmath186 .",

    "the power varies between @xmath187 to @xmath155 for different values of @xmath11 as discussed in the previous section . for positive values of @xmath11",
    "we find that the pressure does not vary substantially comparing to the standard pb prediction .",
    "it is rather important to notice that the effect of the dielectric decrement on the disjoining pressure shows up as an effective  solvent structural force \" @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , between the two charged surfaces that acts at relatively small inter - plate separations , though no structural forces were assumed _ a priori _ in our approach .",
    "this might signal a more general relationship between the dielectric decrement and water structure effects . in the present formulation , where the dielectric decrement itself does not contain any spatial scale , the dependence of the additional  water structural force \" on the inter - plate separation appears to scale with an inverse power of this separation .",
    "however , for a model where the dielectric decrement levels off for larger values of the counter - ion density , the additional phenomenological constant will introduce a new length scale into the problem .",
    "then , possibly also the additional  water structural force \" would show such a length scale .",
    "further refinements and applications can be considered .",
    "for example , the model can be generalized to include salt ions , instead of counter - ions only as was done here .",
    "this will introduce another screening effect ( the debye length ) that will compete with the other contributions .",
    "moreover , the concentration dependence of the dielectric constant can be taken to reproduce the real experimental results in order to improve the quantitative accuracy . finally , by generalizing the model to curved geometries it will be possible to calculate potential of mean force between spheres and cylinders .",
    "the results presented in this work suggest that the effect of ions on the local dielectric constant should be taken into account on equal footing as other ion - specific interactions such as dispersion and hydration .",
    "furthermore , this model may serve as a platform for a more detailed models , taking into account other ion - specific effects",
