    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite-@xcite has been proved to be an extremely useful theoretical tool to understand strongly coupled field theories . in recent years , this holographic correspondence has been applied extensively to describe phase transitions in high @xmath1 superconductors .",
    "the model consists of a system with a ads black hole and a charged scalar field minimally coupled to an abelian gauge field .",
    "the black hole admits scalar hair at a temperature @xmath2 below a certain critical temperature @xmath1 by the mechanism of breaking of a local @xmath3 symmetry near the event horizon of the black hole @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the emergence of a hairy ads black hole implies the formation of a charged scalar condensate in the dual cfts by the ads / cft correspondence .    till date",
    "a number of attempts have been made ( mostly performed numerically ) inorder to understand various properties of holographic superconductors in the framework of usual maxwell electromagnetic theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , some investigations have also been performed in the framework of non - linear electrodynamics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the first analytic computation of the effects of born infeld ( bi ) electrodynamics on @xmath0-wave superconductors has been put forward by us @xcite based on the sturm - liouville ( sl ) eigenvalue problem . in this paper , we present analytical studies of gauss - bonnet holographic superconductors in bi electrodynamics upto first order in the gauss - bonnet and bi coupling parameter in the probe limit .",
    "this means that we study the effect of the leading possible higher derivative corrections to the onset of @xmath4-wave order parameter condensation .",
    "the physical meaning of looking at the leading order corrections of the bi coupling parameter is that we are studying the effects due to higher derivative corrections of gauge fields on the @xmath4-wave order parameter condensation . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of the effects of the curvature corrections on @xmath5-dimensional holographic superconductors is motivated by the application of the mermin - wagner theorem ( which forbids continuous symmetry breaking in @xmath6-dimensions because of large fluctuations in lower dimensions ) to the holographic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of looking at the leading order corrections of the gauss - bonnet coupling parameter is that we are studying the effects due to higher derivative corrections of curvature on the @xmath4-wave order parameter condensation .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the numerical computations carried out by us .",
    "we feel that this study is worthwhile since very little has been done in problems involving non - linear electrodynamics both analytically as well as numerically .    before",
    "going further let us now mention about the organization of our paper . in section 2",
    "we give the basic setup for holographic superconductors in gauss - bonnet ads gravity . in section 3",
    "we explicitly compute the relationship between the critical temperature and charge density . in section 4",
    "we compute the condensation operator near the critical temperature .",
    "finally we draw our conclusion in section 5 .",
    "we perform our analysis in the fixed background of the gauss - bonnet ads space time in the probe limit .",
    "we begin with the action of the einstein gauss - bonnet gravity in five dimensions , which is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for the cosmological constant and @xmath9 is the gauss - bonnet coefficient . at this stage",
    "it is to be noted that for the rest of our analysis we set @xmath10 .",
    "the ricci flat solution for the action ( [ eq1 ] ) is given by , @xmath11 where , @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the adm mass of the black hole , which is related to the horizon radius ( @xmath14 ) as , @xmath15 .",

    "we shall set @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "in order to obtain an explicit relationship between the critical temperature and the charge density we define @xmath40 . under this choice of variables , we may express ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) as , @xmath41 and , @xmath42 respectively .    at @xmath43",

    "we have @xmath45 which has the solution , @xmath46+o(b^{2})\\label{eq6}\\ ] ] with , @xmath47    at this stage it is customary to mention that , since the bi coupling parameter ( @xmath24 ) is too small , therefore throughout the rest of our analysis we consider terms only linear in @xmath24 and drop all the higher order terms in it .    in order to investigate the boundary behavior of @xmath22 ( as @xmath48 ) we consider @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51",
