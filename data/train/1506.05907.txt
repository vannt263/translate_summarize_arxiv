    "there has recently been a revived interest in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for the calculation of electron correlation energies of atomic , molecular and solid - state systems ( see refs .   for recent reviews ) .",
    "one of the advantages of rpa is its good description of dispersion interactions at large separation  @xcite , whereas two important disadvantages are its poor description of short - range electron correlations  @xcite and its slow gaussian basis convergence  @xcite .",
    "these two limitations can be overcome by the range - separation approach ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) which allows one to combine a short - range density - functional approximation with a long - range rpa - type approximation  @xcite .    as a result of the increasing interest in rpa",
    ", there are now several rpa formulations in which rpa equations can be derived , namely the adiabatic connection  @xcite , dielectric matrix  @xcite , plasmon  @xcite formula and ring coupled - cluster doubles  @xcite formulations . moreover , within these formulations , many variants of rpa ( _ e.g. _ , direct rpa  @xcite , rpa with exact hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange  @xcite , rpa with exact kohn - sham exchange  @xcite ) can be defined ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "recently , in a series of papers , we have studied the performance of these rpa variants for closed - shell systems , especially in the range - separated framework . within the ring coupled - cluster doubles formulation , it was found that a spin - restricted closed - shell rpa variant with exchange , first proposed by szabo and ostlund ( see equation ( 3.22 ) of ref .  ) and referred to as szabo - ostlund s second formula ( rpax - so2 ) in ref .",
    ", was one of the best rpa variants for correlation energies , chemical reaction energies , and weak intermolecular binding energies for closed - shell systems with or without range separation  @xcite . in view of future applications , like the simulation of reactivity in condensed phases , where different kinds of intermolecular and intramolecular forces are acting simultaneously in a concomitant manner , it is interesting to know whether we can expect a similar degree of reliability in the description of chemical transformations as for weak non - covalent interactions .",
    "the purpose of this work is thus to further test the performance of the rpax - so2 variant on more general thermochemistry properties , namely atomization energies and reaction barrier heights , now involving open - shell systems . to this end",
    ", we have extended and implemented the rpax - so2 variant , as well as other rpa variants , in a spin - unrestricted formalism with and without range - separation .",
    "another important domain of application of open - shell range - separated rpa may consist of the study of transition metal compounds , which is out of the scope of the present study and will be the subject of forthcoming publications .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we offer an overview of the rpa variants in the adiabatic connection and ring coupled - cluster doubles formulations in a spin - unrestricted formalism . after giving computational details in section  [ sec : compdetails ] , we present in section  [ sec : results ] the results of the different rpa variants with and without range - separation on datasets of atomization energies and reaction barrier heights .",
    "a detailed statistical analysis of the results is given .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we start by giving the rpa correlation energy expressions used in this work , using real - valued canonical spin - orbitals in a spin - unrestricted formalism for general open - shell systems , breaking spatial and @xmath0-spin symmetry ( but not @xmath1-spin symmetry ) .",
    "the rpa correlation energy expressions can be derived in different _ formulations _ ( see ref .  ) .",
    "one way to appreciate the links between the formulations is to consider the adiabatic - connection fluctuation - dissipation theorem expression for the correlation energy  @xcite , which involves integrations over both a frequency and a coupling constant .",
    "an analytical integration over the frequency variable followed by a numerical integration over the coupling constant yields the _ adiabatic - connection formulation _ , while an analytic integration over the coupling constant followed by a numerical integration over the frequency yields the _",
    "dielectric formulation_. in certain cases , the two integrations can be carried out analytically which leads to two other formulations : the _ plasmon - formula formulation _ and the _ ring coupled - cluster doubles formulation_. depending on the approximations used , the correlation energies derived in these four formulations are in general not equivalent .",
    "here we consider only the adiabatic - connection and ring coupled - cluster doubles formulations .    in the adiabatic - connection formulation ,",
    "the rpa correlation energy is written as the integral over the coupling constant @xmath2 of the trace of the correlation part of a two - particle density matrix @xmath3 contracted with a matrix @xmath4 of two - electron integrals at @xmath5 .",

    "all the rpa correlation energy variants reduce to the second - order mller - plesset ( mp2 ) correlation energy expression  @xcite , except for the drpa - i variant which reduces to direct mp2  @xcite .",
    "the drpa - i , drpa - ii , and sosex variants are free from instabilities by construction . in a spin - restricted closed - shell formalism ,",
    "the rpax - i and rpax - so2 variants involve only spin - singlet excitations and are thus not subject to triplet instabilities , while the rpax - ii variant involves both spin - singlet and spin - triplet excitations and are thus prone to triplet instabilities .",
    "because for spin - unrestricted calculations the @xmath1-spin symmetry is imposed ( i.e. , each spin - orbital has a definite spin @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) , the spin - flipped excitations ( when the spin - orbitals @xmath42 and @xmath43 have different spins , or the spin - orbitals @xmath44 and @xmath45 have different spins ) do not contribute to the drpa - i , drpa - ii , rpax - i , sosex , and rpax - so2 correlation energy variants .",
    "this can be exploited to reduce the cost of the calculations and to avoid that the evaluation of the correlation energy in these rpa variants be contaminated by spin - flipped instabilities . on the other hand",

    "for the dbh24/08 dataset , at @xmath67 , the rsh+mp2 , rsh+drpa - i , and rsh+rpax - so2 methods all give similar mads of about 3 kcal / mol .",
    "these results confirm the representativeness of the ae6 and bh6 datasets and justifies the subsequent analysis of the range - separated mp2 , drpa - i , and rpax - so2 methods at @xmath67 .",
    "we note that full - range rpa calculations are often performed as post - kohn - sham calculations , i.e. using kohn - sham orbitals and orbital energies .",

    "for the dbh24/08 dataset , the three full - range methods tend to overestimate the reaction barrier heights .",

    "given that for atomization energies and reaction barrier heights rsh+mp2 is about as accurate as rsh+rpax - so2 while being less expensive , one could conclude that rsh+mp2 is a better method .",
    "however , rsh+rpax - so2 is significantly more accurate that rsh+mp2 for weak intermolecular interactions ( see ref .  [ ] ) , hence rsh+rpax - so2 appears as a more systematic method for various types of applications .",
    "we have implemented several rpa correlation energy variants in a spin - unrestricted formalism with or without range separation , and tested them on thermochemistry datasets of atomization energies and reaction barrier heights .",

    "specifically , the rsh+rpax - so2 variant is among the most accurate range - separated rpa variant with mean absolute deviations of about 4 kcal / mol for atomization energies and about 3 kcal / mol on reaction barrier heights .",
