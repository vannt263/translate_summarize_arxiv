    "in particular , the inner region where the temperatures rise above 10002000 k , ( roughly where dust grains evaporate ) might become thermally unstable ( see e.g. @xcite ) . though the location of the disk instability regime depends on the opacity model , the mass loss rate of the agb primary , and other input parameters , fig .",

    "thus , our steady - state disks still correctly represent the likely physical state of the system .",
    "accreted material has a more significant impact on accreting white dwarfs . aside from their visibility as symbiotic stars ,",
    "wind - fed disks surrounding white dwarfs can produce a variety of eruptive phenomena @xcite . at low accretion rates ,",
    "cold white dwarfs undergo degenerate shell flashes and become classical novae @xcite .",
    "white dwarfs accreting at larger rates yield non - degenerate flashes as in the symbiotic stars v1016 cyg and hm sge @xcite . in some systems ,",
    "the rates are sufficient to allow the white dwarf to evolve close to the chandrasekhar limit and become a type ia supernova @xcite .",
    "steady - state surface density profiles generally follow expectation . over the entire disk ,",
    "the surface density approximately scales with radius as @xmath165 , with @xmath166 0.81.5 .",
    "the normalization of the surface density scales almost linearly with the accretion rate into the disk .",
    "changes in slope typically occur in the inner disk , when the disk becomes hot enough to evaporate dust grains , and in the outer disk , when the energy generated by irradiation or infall dominates the energy generated by viscosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we briefly explored the effect of different viscosity parameters on the overall structure and mass of the disks ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in general , the steady state disk mass is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath69 , and scales linearly with @xmath167 .",
    "these results hold as long as the disk is cold .",
    "as the disk gets hotter , more of the disk has an opacity dependent temperature which slightly changes the relation , but the overall behavior is close to linear .",
    "beside the different overall scaling , the disk spatial structure is very similar .",
    "steady - state temperature profiles are generally shallower than steady - steady accretion disks fed by a lobe - filling companion @xcite . in most steady disks , the effective temperature of the disk scales with radius as @xmath168 , with @xmath169 0.75 . for wind - fed disks in very wide binaries at very low accretion rates ,",
    "the steady - state slope approaches the standard @xmath169 0.75 . as the binary separation contracts and the wind accretion rate grows , the temperature profile becomes more shallow .",
    "for the closest binaries , our results suggest @xmath169 0.4 . the range in the slope is small , from @xmath169 0.4 in close binaries with large accretion rates to @xmath169 0.7 in wide binaries with small accretion rates .",
    "thus , the temperature profile scales very weakly with the separation or the mass loss rate of the primary star .",
    "the results from the calculations lead to several broad conclusions . physical properties of wind - fed accretion disks depend on the orbital separation and the evolutionary state ( mass loss rate ) of the primary star .",
    "when the secondary is a main sequence star , it is observable only when the binary is close and the primary is an agb star .",
    "otherwise , wind - fed accretion has few , if any , direct observational consequences .",
    "when the secondary is a white dwarf , the binary is almost always observable as a symbiotic star .",
    "although optical / uv spectroscopic observations are sufficient to detect luminous symbiotic stars @xcite , direct imaging can often reveal the binary companion . in mira b , iue",
    "spectroscopic observations first identified emission from a hot white dwarf accreting material from the mira wind @xcite , recent hst observations resolved the system and detected the accretion disk directly @xcite . for a derived binary separation of @xmath28 70 au , the inferred accretion luminosity of @xmath170yr@xmath147 @xcite is roughly consistent with our models .",
    "high resolution imaging of other symbiotic - like binaries , including r aqr and ch cyg , would provide additional tests of these calculations .    aside from producing interesting symbiotic stars , wd accretors in wide binaries can accrete enough material to approach the chandrasekhar limit ( table 2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . if these wds grow , they are susceptible to traditional type ia supernovae @xcite and to sub - chandrasekhar helium detonation supernovae ( e.g. @xcite . in most simulations ,",
    "the growth of the white dwarf depends on the way material is accreted .",
    "thus , understanding the structure of the disk is important for understanding whether wind - fed white dwarfs are good sne progenitors .",
    "our disk models provide a step along the path to understanding these outcomes .",
    "wind - fed disks around white dwarfs provide a less traditional connection to other astrophysical systems . for separations of @xmath171 au and mass loss rates of @xmath172 m@xmath173 , wind - fed disks have surface density and temperature profiles similar to those observed in low - mass protoplanetary disks . for comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig : density - profile ] shows the range of surface density profiles inferred for an ensemble of protoplanetary disks in nearby star - forming regions @xcite .",

    "yield planets on short timescales .",
    "given the similar lifetimes of agb mass - losing primary stars , it is plausible that some aspects of planet formation occur in the wind - fed disks of wide binary systems @xcite .    despite the similarity in instantaneous disk masses , disks in wide binaries",
    "have a distinct advantage over protoplanetary disks in producing planets .",
    "continuous feeding by the primary star guarantees that the total mass available for planet formation is , in principle , larger for wide binaries than for protoplanetary disks . in close binaries with evolved agb primaries , the total mass accreted by the central star is at least as large as the most protoplanetary disk . thus , massive planets could grow in many of these disks .",
    "testing this idea is challenging .",
    "the most massive disks in wide binaries are not as large as those in protoplanetary disks ; dust emission from the agb primary complicates acquiring the submm and mm observations required to estimate dust masses .",
    "occasional nova eruptions may also frustrate the coagulation processes that grow dust grains from the mira wind into the planetesimals that produce planets . however , alma has sufficient resolution to detect structures in the disks of wide binaries . identifying structures",
    "similar to those in protoplanetary disks might allow robust comparisons between the grain properties and the profiles of surface density and temperature .",
    "detection of debris disks around nearby white dwarfs suggests that planets ( or debris from planets ) survive the evolution from a main sequence star into a white dwarf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the frequency of wide wd companions to wd debris disks provides some estimate for the likelihood of this ` second generation ' planet formation scenario .",
    "using a set of numerical calculations , we have explored the evolution and long term steady state structure of wind - accretion disks in wide evolved binaries ( @xmath174 au ) .",
    "these systems evolve rapidly ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mass - profile ] ) and achieve a steady state on timescales which are typically much shorter than typical stellar evolution timescales of @xmath175 yr . during steady state ,",
    "disks have similar surface density and temperature profiles with total masses of a few@xmath176 m@xmath151 .",
    "the radial density profile is a broken power law in the inner regions and an exponential decline at the outer edge where the disk is truncated by tidal forces from the companion .",
    "the radial temperature profile is also described by a broken power law but does not decline dramatically at the outer edge of the disk .",
    "understanding the formation , structure , and evolution of wind - fed accretion disks is important for a wide variety of phenomena in evolved wide binary systems , including chemically peculiar stars , novae , supernovae , stellar outbursts , and symbiotic binaries . in close binary systems with evolved agb primaries , significant accretion from a wind - fed disk",
    "provides a natural mechanism for chemical enrichment and abundance anomalies in otherwise normal main sequence and white dwarf stars . over a broad range of separations and mass loss rates , wind - fed accretion onto white dwarfs",
    "can produce nova eruptions and , possibly , supernova eruptions . by providing a foundation for relating the mass loss rate of evolved red giants to the temperature and luminosity of the companion ,",
    "our results also enable more detailed studies of the physical structure of individual binary systems .",
    "our analysis begins to make a link between the disks in evolved binaries and protoplanetary disks .",
    "the structure and evolution of both types of disks depends on uncertain physics , including the disk viscosity and interactions between stellar photons and disk material . for most accretion rates ,",
    "large disks often drive massive winds which may interact with the surrounding wind from the primary ( in a binary system ) or a molecular cloud ( in a protostellar system ) .",
