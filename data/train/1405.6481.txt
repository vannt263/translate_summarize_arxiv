    "this year marks the 500th anniversary of the copperplate engraving _",
    "melencolia  i _ by the great artist - mathematician albrecht d \" urer  ( 14711528 ) .",
    "a good way for math lovers to celebrate this anniversary is to play a time - honored  party game \" that has attracted art historians and scientists for many years : guessing the nature and meaning of the composition s enigmatic stone polyhedron , illustrated in figure  [ setup ] .",
    "published attempts at playing the game date back at least a century @xcite .",
    "in fact , it s a game that may go on indefinitely , because ( 1 ) we have no writings by d \" urer  definitively saying what the polyhedron is , ( 2 ) our ability to measure and analyze the polyhedron is subject to at least some small errors , and ( 3 ) the image itself has anomalous features , some of which we discuss in the appendix .",
    "nevertheless the polyhedron , sometimes known as  d \" urer s solid \" , seems to be accurately drawn for the most part , and authors such as macgillavry @xcite have been able to get good fits of their models by allowing for a certain amount of human error in both drawing and measuring . in this article",
    "we discuss a possible model of the solid and compare it to the results of macgillavry and others .",
    "we will try to make the case that one of the most convenient and effective ways to score the game is to use the cross ratio .",
    "we show how the cross ratio works as a projectively invariant  shape parameter \" of the polyhedron , and how it can be used in analyzing various theories of this figure .",
    "a commonly accepted rule of the game is the assumption that the polyhedron is formed by starting with a _ trigonal trapezohedron _ or _",
    "trigonal deltohedron_a three - dimensional figure whose faces are six congruent rhombi ( a cube is such a figure ) .",
    "then , with the longest diagonal held vertically , congruent tetrahedrons are cropped off the top and bottom by horizontal planes , leaving congruent equilateral triangles as the top and bottom faces .",
    "the other six faces  the truncated rhombi  are thus congruent pentagons .",
    "the shape of the solid is completely determined by the shape of one of the pentagonal faces , hence many authors describe their model of the solid by describing the shape of one of these pentagons .",
    "in addition to rules , the game should have some method for scoring various attempts at it , at least in an informal way .",
    "first of all , it makes no sense to play the game if we assume that d \" urer  was such a poor draftsman that we can simply ignore the engraving and conjecture any shape we want .",
    "we therefore require that a proposed model of the solid should have a shape that is close to that derived by perspective analysis of the engraving .",
    "in addition to respecting d \" urer  as an artist , we must acknowledge his reputation as a mathematician . in the words of the respected mathematician morris kline ,   of all the renaissance artists ,",
    "the best mathematician was the german albrecht d \" urer  \" @xcite . among other things , d",
    "\" urer  owned a copy of euclid and wrote well - respected treatises on proportion , including ",
    "significantly for us  the golden ratio .",
    "thus we assume that d \" urer  incorporated some kind of interesting mathematical relationships into the design of the solid , rather than just sketching until he found something that looked pleasing to him .",
    "a proposed model of the solid should include the description of such relationships .",
    "under the assumptions of the game , the shape of the solid is completely determined by two numbers , which we refer to as  shape parameters \" . as we mentioned earlier , the shape of the solid is determined by the shape of one of the six congruent pentagonal faces .",
    "the shape of a pentagonal face ( see figure  [ generic - face ] ) can be specified by the acute angle @xmath0 of the rhombus and another parameter @xmath1 , which determines the level at which the rhombus is truncated .",
    "one obvious candidate for @xmath1 would be the ratio of distances @xmath2 in figure  [ generic - face ] ; that is , the fraction of @xmath3 left after truncation . however , this parameter has one disadvantage ; it can not always be measured directly in a perspective drawing of the face , because perspective often distorts the ratios of lengths .     and",
    "@xmath1 determine the shape of the truncated rhombic face and hence the shape of the solid . ]    fortunately , given four collinear points @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 as in figure  [ generic - face ] , there is a quantity whose value is not changed by perspective , namely the _ cross ratio _ , among other things . ]",
    "@xmath8 defined by @xmath9 for a truncated rhombic face like the one in figure  [ generic - face ] , there is a convenient relationship between the cross ratio and the ratio @xmath2 . letting @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 solving ( [ lambda ] ) for @xmath2 gives @xmath12    from ( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ bc / ac ] ) we see that the truncation of the rhombus determines the value of the cross ratio @xmath1 , and the value of @xmath1 determines the truncation of the rhombus .",
    "since @xmath1 is projectively invariant  that is , unchanged by the distortion of perspective  we choose it as the second shape parameter .",
    "perhaps the most thorough and frequently cited perspective analysis of the solid is the one done by macgillavry @xcite .",
    "macgillavry estimated the shape parameters of the pentagonal faces by computing them several different ways , applying the rules of perspective to different parts of the engraving and averaging the results .",
    "macgillavry estimated @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ m - face](a ) shows such a pentagon in solid gray , with macgillavry s minimum value of @xmath15 . from this value of @xmath2 and equation ( [ lambda ] )",
    "we see that macgillavry s work implies @xmath16    our own estimate of @xmath1 is close to that of macgillavry . in figure  [ setup ]",
    "we have extended sides of the three visible pentagonal faces to locate the truncated vertices @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the rhombi . for @xmath19 , the lines @xmath20 are the centerlines of the rhombi , the points @xmath21 are the centers , and the points @xmath22 are the truncation points of the centerlines .",
    "if our assumptions about the polyhedron are correct , and if the drawing and our measurements were perfect , then the cross ratios @xmath23 would be exactly the same for @xmath19 . in an imperfect world , we of course expect some variation",
    ". one of the authors computed these cross ratios by importing a digital image of _ melencolia  i _ into the program geogebra , and found @xmath24 to allow for imperfections as macgillavry did , we average these three values to get @xmath25 .    the reader may have noticed that these estimates of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are suspiciously close to a famous number : the golden ratio @xmath28 , where @xmath29 following this clue , our model of the solid is based on the golden ratio , with parameters we denote by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "figure  [ m - face](b ) shows our proposed model of a face in black outline .",
    "the rhombus is inscribed in a pair of golden rectangles , each with height @xmath32 and width @xmath28 .",
    "the truncation line is easily found by drawing a @xmath33 line from the center of the rhombus until it meets an edge of the rhombus as shown .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath34 , resulting in a cross ratio , via ( [ lambda ] ) , of @xmath35     version of macgillavry s pentagonal face in solid gray . in ( b ) the  golden \" pentagon in black outline , with the rhombus inscribed in a pair of golden rectangles . in ( c ) macgillavry s pentagon in solid gray , and the golden pentagon in dashed black outline .",
    "when drawn at this size , they are practically identical . ]    thus the cross ratio is the golden ratio .",
    "the acute angle @xmath30 is given by @xmath36 the values of @xmath31 and @xmath30 are very close to macgillavry s values of @xmath37 and @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure  [ m - face](c ) , the two pentagons are nearly indistinguishable ( macgillavry s is solid gray and ours is the dashed black outline ) . for the above reasons we ( somewhat playfully ) refer to the pentagon in ( b ) as a _",
    "golden pentagon_.    to analyze how close the two pentagons really are , observe that the half - width of the pentagon in figure  [ m - face](a ) , divided by the half - width of the pentagon in ( b ) is @xmath38 .",
    "thus if the half - widths of the pentagons are about an inch ( they re actually a little less ) , then the difference in the half - widths is less than a thousandth of an inch .",
    "the ratios of the heights of each pentagon above the horizontal centerline is @xmath39 .",
    "thus if these heights are about a half inch ( again they re a little less ) , then the difference between them is about three thousandths of an inch .",
    "we conclude that from an intuitive , visual standpoint , macgillavry s minimum - angle solution of @xmath37 and @xmath15 is essentially the same as ours , minus the  golden \" formulation of the shape parameters : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "over the years many theories have been advanced as to the shape of d \" urer s solid , or equivalently , its pentagonal faces . with so many possibilities , any particular one of them ( including this one ) probably stands only a small chance of being right .",
    "the advantage of this abundance of theories is that it can be as much fun testing old theories as it is cooking up new ones .",
    "following our methods of the previous section , we show how the cross ratio can be applied to this variation of the game .",
    "figure  [ 4-grid ] depicts a model conjectured by lynch @xcite , who guessed that vertices of the solid project orthogonally onto the lattice points of a @xmath42 grid , thus linking it with a @xmath42 magic square that appears in _",
    "melencolia  i_. however , if this were true , we would have ( assuming for simplicity that the squares are 1 unit on a side ) , @xmath43 which differs significantly ( about @xmath44 ) from our measured value of @xmath25 and macgillavry s estimate of @xmath45 .",
    "we conclude that lynch s idea is not in good agreement with d \" urer s perspective rendering of the solid .",
    "figure  [ 72 ] depicts a model by schreiber having an acute rhombus angle of @xmath46 and a truncation chosen so that the face is inscribed in a circle . but",
    "a straightforward computation shows that this requires a ratio of @xmath47 .",
    "when substituted into ( [ lambda ] ) , this gives a cross ratio value of @xmath48 , which differs from macgillavry s estimate and ours by more than @xmath49 .",
    "this can be checked approximately by using a ruler and protractor to draw the @xmath46 rhombus , and a circle template to choose a circle that passes through its left , right , and bottom vertices .",
    "the circle then determines the truncation . in either case",
    "the cross ratio of the resulting pentagon contradicts the evidence of the engraving itself .",
    "in addition , the @xmath46 angle is @xmath50 less than macgillavry s minimum value of @xmath51 .    ,",
    "circle - inscribed face conjectured by schreiber @xcite . ]",
    "figure  [ sketch ] shows a drawing from a d \" urer  sketchbook found by weitzel @xcite .",
    "weitzel conjectured that this drawing is a preliminary sketch of a face of the solid in _",
    "melencolia  i _ , and estimated the rhombus angle to be @xmath52 , apparently based on the angle at the upper left in figure  [ sketch](b ) .",
    "however , we noticed that the drawing is not perfectly symmetrical , as the other angle is about @xmath53 .",
    "the average of these values is close to macgillavry s lower bound of @xmath51 .",
    "a feature of the sketch that is _ not _ consistent with macgillavry s results is the truncation ratio of approximately @xmath54 indicated in figure  [ sketch](b ) , apparently intended to allow for a circumscribed circle .",
    "this is significantly different from macgillavry s value of @xmath55 for the faces of d \" urer s solid . alternatively , letting @xmath56 in equation ( [ lambda ] ) yields a cross ratio @xmath1 for weitzel s model of @xmath57 which is again significantly different from our measured value of @xmath25 and macgillavry s estimate of @xmath45 .",
    "this suggests that d \" urer  may have used an outer rhombus much like that in figure  [ sketch ] for the face of his solid , but truncated it differently for some reason . assuming that the sketch really is for _ melencolia  i _",
    ", our suggestion for the different truncation would be that the resulting face has a cross ratio equal to the golden ratio .",
    "under the usual assumptions , the shape of d \" urer s solid can be specified by a pair @xmath58 of shape parameters , as illustrated in figure  [ generic - face ] .",
    "of the two , the cross ratio @xmath1 is the easiest to investigate empirically , because it is projectively invariant .",
    "the two parameters , which are independent of one another , are equally important in determining the solid , but in the literature the angle @xmath0 seems to have attracted more attention .",
    "for example , ishizu @xcite provides a table of values of @xmath0 proposed by various authors going back to 1900 , but no corresponding table of values of @xmath1 , or any other parameter that would determine the truncation of the rhombus .",
    "we urge future players of the game to give equal consideration to both parameters , and we suggest the projectively invariant cross ratio as the parameter to determine the truncation .",
    "interestingly , ishizu s table shows that in the literature , the proposed values of @xmath0 cluster around either @xmath59 ( largely because it is consistent with the perspective of the engraving ) or @xmath46 because of its connection with the golden ratio  a connection that might have attracted d \" urer , namely @xmath60 but if that is a nice connection with the golden ratio  one that would appeal to d \" urer  the mathematician  then surely the double connection @xmath61 which we propose , @xmath62 must have some appeal as well , especially since it is compatible with the perspective of d \" urer s rendering of the solid .    fortunately for the anniversary celebration , neither this model nor any other will end the game of guessing the intended shape of the solid .",
    "any proposed values of @xmath0 and @xmath28 can agree only approximately with the engraving and , as we show in the appendix , the engraving itself has some anomalous features that make measurements of it even more uncertain .",
    "there s plenty of room for more ideas and more players .",
