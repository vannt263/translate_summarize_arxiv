    "the string - net hamiltonian with a string tension is defined as @xmath7 the first term is the string - net hamiltonian introduced by levin and wen @xcite defined on a ladder .",

    "the second term is diagonal in the link ( edge ) basis since @xmath10 is the projector onto the state @xmath11 , acting on the rung @xmath12 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we set @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    for any modular theory",
    ", @xmath15 has a remarkable property first identified in ref .  . indeed , for twisted boundary conditions , its spectrum is exactly self - dual , i.e. , it is invariant under the transformation @xmath16 that amounts to exchange @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in particular ,",
    "energy spectra for @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the same as for and @xmath21 , respectively . for periodic boundary conditions",
    ", the self - duality is broken for finite - size systems but it is restored in the thermodynamical limit up to degeneracies .",
    "this discrepancy can readily be observed on the ground - state degeneracy which , for any modular theory with @xmath5 anyons and for , is @xmath5-fold ( @xmath22-fold ) degenerate for twisted ( periodic ) boundary conditions .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath23 , the ground state is @xmath5-fold degenerate for twisted and for periodic boundary conditions .    for periodic boundary conditions considered in the following , @xmath15 commutes with the translation operator along the ladder direction @xmath24 and also with the reflection operator in the transverse direction @xmath25 .",

    "there are two reasons for which @xmath37 , and hence @xmath38 , commutes with @xmath15 : ( i ) by construction , any closed - string operator ( in the canonical link basis ) commutes with the string - net hamiltonian @xcite and ( ii ) @xmath37 does not change the rung degrees of freedom @xmath39 so that it commutes with the second term in @xmath15 .",
    "however , since these fluxes can be different above and below the ladder ( see fig .",

    "one clearly sees the formation of a singularity but one can not infer its nature from numerics .",
    "however , as discussed in the next section , we will see that this is also a first - order transition point .",
    "thus , the phase diagram consists in three phases separated by first - order transitions located at @xmath59 , and @xmath20 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram ] ) .      for",
    ", the system is in the d@xmath0 phase which is adiabatically connected to the point @xmath23 and hence gapped ( high - order perturbative series expansions of the gap and of the ground - state energy in the limit @xmath61 can be found in appendix [ app : series ] ) .    since the spectrum is self - dual , a gapped dual phase d@xmath62 is obtained for .",
    "similar gapped phases are found exactly in the same range for fibonacci and ising theories .",
    "the most intriguing result is the existence of a gapped phase ( denoted by @xmath63 in the following ) for instead of critical phases found in this range for previously studied theories @xcite .    .",
    "]    unfortunately , the huge ground - state degeneracy at @xmath55 and @xmath20 prevents to perform a perturbative analysis of the low - energy spectrum in this parameter range .",
    "however , as we shall now see , ed results unveil two striking properties .",
    "\\(i ) the first one concerns the ground - state energy which equals zero in the whole range @xmath64 $ ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gse ] ) . despite the fact that if the rung @xmath12 belongs to the plaquette @xmath65 , it is indeed possible to build zero - energy eigenstates of these two non - commuting projectors .",
    "such states are eigenstates for any @xmath26 but , interestingly , they become ground states for @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "a simple example of such a state can be easily sketched by switching from the ladder basis to the bubble basis ( see supplementary information in ref .   for details",
    "about this basis transformation ) . in this representation ,",
    "a bubble with different inner and outer legs is a zero - energy eigenstate of the corresponding plaquette operator @xmath8 whereas two neighboring bubbles of different type ensure a zero - energy eigenstate of the ( shared- ) link operator @xmath10 .",
    "for the @xmath0 theory , these two constraints can easily be satisfied simultaneously ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : russian_doll ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we checked that such a construction does not exhaust all possible zero - energy states whose degeneracy is numerically found to grow exponentially with the system size .",
    "as a side remark , let us mention that we also find zero - energy eigenstates ( stemming from a different construction ) in the ising ladder but with a degeneracy only growing linearly with the system size .",
    "furthermore , such states are absent for fibonacci anyons .",
    "\\(ii ) the second unusual property is related to the low - energy gap @xmath66 which is numerically found to be dependent of @xmath26 but surprisingly independent of the system size ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : russian_doll ] ) .",
    "although we have not been able to build the corresponding states for any sizes , we computed @xmath66 exactly by solving the @xmath67 problem and we get @xmath68.\\ ] ] the corresponding eigenstates are all translation invariant and their degeneracy is numerically found to grow exponentially with the system size .",
    "unfortunately , contrary to zero - energy states discussed above , we have not been able to find a simple procedure to build any of these low - energy states .",
    "this size - independent gap suggests that , for any , there might exist other size - independent energy levels and this is indeed the case .",
    "for instance , we find that levels with energies @xmath69 and @xmath70 exist for all @xmath48 .",
    "this russian doll ( @xmath71atrioshka ) spectrum is an intriguing result that clearly deserves further investigations and a deeper understanding especially since such a structure does not occur for fibonacci and ising theories .",
    "size - independent levels are highlighted .",
    "the gap is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap_exact ] ) .",
    "inset : a possible building block for zero - energy eigenstates described in the bubble basis @xcite ( red=2 , green=1 , and blue=0 ) . ]",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , @xmath15 is not exactly solvable for arbitrary @xmath26 .",
    "however , it turns out that , apart from the trivial cases @xmath72 , there are two additional points for which @xmath15 is exactly solvable .    for , the hamiltonian can be written as where @xmath73 operators form a representation of the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath74=0 \\:\\ : { \\rm for } \\:\\ : |i - j|\\geqslant 2.\\ ] ] derivation of this result is the same as for fibonacci and ising theories @xcite so that we do not reproduce it here .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to prove this mapping for arbitrary modular theories but we conjecture that it is always valid .    using the correspondence between this temperley - lieb chain and the _ antiferromagnetic _ @xmath1 chain with an anisotropy parameter @xmath75 @xcite ,",
    "we conclude that the spectrum is gapless for @xmath76 and gapped for @xmath77 .",
    "thus , for a given theory , if is a transition point , it is a critical point for @xmath76 and a first - order transition point for @xmath77 .    for the @xmath0 theory ,",
    "the total quantum dimension @xmath78 is strictly larger than two ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : theory ] ) and one can compute the exact value of the gap in the thermodynamical limit @xcite . setting @xmath79",
    ", one gets @xmath80 to extract the gap @xmath81 from ed , one must carefully analyze the spectrum in each topological sector and keep in mind that , with periodic boundary conditions , ground - state topological sectors in the d@xmath0 phase are such that @xmath82 .",
    "by contrast , in the d@xmath62 phase there is one ground state in each sector @xmath83 so that the ground state is expected to be ( 9 + 3)-fold degenerate at the transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , we plot the first excitation energies in sectors @xmath82 .",
    "as can be seen , the lowest one goes to zero whereas the second one converges to @xmath81 in the thermodynamical limit .     for @xmath58 .",
    "dotted lines are guide for the eyes . ]    for @xmath84 , one has @xmath85 so that its low - energy properties are now those of the _ ferromagnetic _ @xmath1 chain @xcite which is also only gapped for @xmath77 . for the @xmath0 theory ,",
    "one then gets @xmath86 in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap_exact ] ) .",
    "note that , for this anyon theory , the point @xmath84 is not a transition point .",
    "we studied the phase diagram of a string - net ladder in the presence of a string tension . for the anyon theory considered here , namely the @xmath0 theory",
    ", we found that this diagram consists in three gapped phases separated by first - order transitions .",
    "this strongly contrasts with fibonacci @xcite and ising @xcite theories for which a critical point is found at @xmath58 and a critical phase for @xmath64 $ ] . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : self - dual ] using a mapping onto the antiferromagnetic @xmath1 chain , this originates from the fact that these two theories have a total quantum dimension smaller than two . for the @xmath0 theory",
    ", we found a russian doll spectrum which is found neither for the fibonacci theory nor for the ising theory .",
    "however , we do not know whether such a curiosity exists for other anyon theories .",
    "we also described a simple way to build zero - energy eigenstates which can be easily extended to other non - abelian anyon theories such as the one obeying su@xmath87 fusion rules .    to conclude ,",
    "let us emphasize that the phase diagram has been analyzed by considering the ground state and the first - excited state .",
    "however , interesting features also emerge in higher - energy levels .",
    "in particular , when the total quantum dimension is larger than two , one can show that elementary excitations in the ground - state sector are anyonic bound states suggesting a possible relationship between the nature of phase transitions and the existence of low - energy bound states .",
    "we wish to thank e. ardonne and p. finch for insightful discussions .",
    "thereafter , we give all informations about the @xmath0 unitary modular tensor category ( umtc ) .",
    "details about their derivation can be found in ref .  .",
    "the @xmath0 umtc is a rank - three modular categories which means that it contains three types of anyons @xmath88 ( denoted by @xmath89 , respectively , in ref .  ) .",
    "these anyons obey the following fusion rules @xmath90      the modular @xmath34-matrix is given by @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 are the quantum dimensions of the anyons , and is the total quantum dimension .",
    "indices of @xmath34 are given by the anyon type and thus run here from zero to two .",
    "the key ingredient to build the string - net hamiltonian is the set of @xmath35-symbols @xcite .",
    "these @xmath35-symbols are defined as follows : @xmath94{./f_before.pdf}\\end{array } =   \\sum_f \\left[f^{abc}_d \\right ] _ { ef } \\begin{array}{c}\\includegraphics[width=1cm]{./f_after.pdf}\\end{array}. \\label{eq : fmove}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] general formul for any su@xmath95 theory can be found in ref .",
    "but we give them here explicitly for the case @xmath96 which is relevant for our purpose . for @xmath96 and considering only integer labels of su@xmath95 , there are several nontrivial @xmath97 symbols , which can be written in the following matrix form    @xmath98    @xmath99    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    as for the @xmath34-matrix , indices of these matrices run from zero to two .",
    "other @xmath35-symbols are equal to 1 if fusion channels are allowed and 0 otherwise .",
    "missing symbols can be found by using the following identities : @xmath104      the @xmath105-symbols are defined as follows : @xmath94{./r_braid.pdf}\\end{array } = r^{ab}_c \\begin{array}{c}\\includegraphics[width=1cm]{./r_unbraid.pdf}\\end{array}. \\label{eq : rmove}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the @xmath105-symbols are only non - zero for vertices obeying the fusion rules . as braiding with",

    "finally , we would like to mention that this set of @xmath35-symbols and @xmath105-symbols can be changed into a new set @xmath109 and @xmath110 according to the following gauge transformation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
