    "the exclusive electroproduction of mesons on the nucleon is an important tool to better understand the nucleon structure and , more generally , the transition between the low energy hadronic and high energy partonic domains of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) theory . the cebaf ( `` continous electron beam accelerator facility '' ) of the jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) at newport news ( usa ) with its high intensity electron beam and its large acceptance spectrometer clas @xcite ( cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ) offers a great opportunity to study the exclusive electroproduction of mesons , in particular those that have multi - particle decays .",
    "this proceeding presents some first results for the exclusive electroproduction of the vector mesons @xmath0 on the proton at clas .",
    "these results come from the e1-dvcs experiment : the data were collected between march and may 2005 with a beam energy of 5.75 gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath2 fb@xmath3 .",
    "it is the first ever measurement of cross section for the @xmath0 electroproduction channel .",
    "the presented results are still preliminary and more details can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "the final state that is analyzed is @xmath4 . the final state particles @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 were detected in clas and the exclusive process was identified by selecting a neutron with the missing mass technique .",
    "figure [ fitq2xb ] shows the acceptance - corrected invariant mass @xmath8 distributions for each @xmath9 bin .",
    "one sees clearly the @xmath10 peaks around 775 mev .",
    "they are , however , sitting on top of a non - negligeable non - resonant , two - pion background .",
    "we have used two contributions to fit these spectra : a skewed breit - wigner distribution to describe the resonant structure of the @xmath0 and a parametrization of the non - resonant two - pion continuum determined from simulations ( mostly @xmath4 phase space ) . in order to extract the total cross section of the reaction @xmath11 , we have calculated for each @xmath9 bin the area of the breit - wigner ( green curve in fig .",
    "[ fitq2xb ] ) , the distributions being already normalized and corrected for the acceptance .",
    "a separation of the longitudinal cross sections from the transverse ones was performed by analysing the pion decay angles of the @xmath0 and relying on the schc ( @xmath12-channel helicity conservation ) , which was checked experimentally .",
    "acceptance - corrected distributions , showing fits for the background subtraction . in black : experimental data ; in green : breit - wigner of @xmath0 ; in purple : @xmath8 projection of the the non - resonant continuum @xmath13 reaction ; in red : total fit result . in this proceeding , units are arbitrary for the vertical scale.,width=529 ]",
    "we will compare in the following the extracted cross sections of the exclusive electroproduction of the @xmath0 with two theoretical approaches : on the one hand , the hadronic approach based on regge theory and meson trajectory exchanges in the @xmath1-channel and on the other hand , the partonic approach based on the handbag diagram and gpds .",
    "these two approaches are illustrated in fig .",

    "it consists of exchanges of meson `` trajectories '' in the @xmath1-channel . in the following",
    ", we will use the `` jml '' acronym to refer to the specific model developed by j .-",
    "laget @xcite .    for the @xmath0 channel , the exchange trajectories are those of the @xmath6 and of the @xmath0 . the free parameters in this model are the coupling constants at the hadronic vertices ( most of them being well constrained ) and the mass scales of the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "figure [ xsectionrhoplaget ] shows the total cross section @xmath15 as a function of @xmath16 for fixed @xmath14 compared with the jml calculation shown with the red curve .",
    "the jml model can successfully reproduce the cross sections for almost all of our @xmath17 range .",
    "the decreasing cross section with @xmath16 can be explained in the regge theory by an intercept ( @xmath18 ) of the @xmath0 trajectory which is dominant : @xmath19 .     at fixed @xmath14 , for the reaction @xmath20 .",
    "the red curves are the result of the jml model .",

    "it was proven @xcite that the dominant process for exclusive meson electroproduction , in the bjorken limit , is given by the so - called handbag diagram represented in fig .",
    "[ reggegpds ] .",
    "the handbag diagram is based on the notion of factorization in leading - order / leading - twist pqcd between a hard scattering process , exactly calculable in pqcd , and a nonperturbative nucleon structure part that is parametrized by the gpds . for mesons ,",
    "the factorization of the handbag diagram is only valid for the longitudinal part of the cross section . in the following",
    "we discuss the two particular gk @xcite and vgg @xcite gpd - based calculations that provide quantitative results for the longitudinal part of the exclusive meson cross sections .",
    "figure [ theoryrhoplus ] shows longitudinal cross section of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath16 and for fixed @xmath14 .",
    "the results of the calculations of the gk and vgg model are shown , respectively , with the red and the blue curves .",
    "we see that both models fail to reproduce the data .",
    "this discrepancy can reach an order of magnitude at the lowest @xmath16 values .",
    "the trend of these particular gpd calculations is to decrease as @xmath16 decreases , whereas the data increase .",
    "the same behavior was observed , in the low @xmath16 region , for the exclusive electroproduction of the @xmath24 @xcite .     at fixed @xmath14 , for the reaction @xmath20 .",
    "the red and the blue curves are the results of the gk and vgg models .",
    "units are arbitrary on the y axis as the results are still preliminary .",
    ", width=529 ]    one can conclude that either the gpd formalism is not valid for our @xmath14 coverage ( due to important higher twist contributions for instance ) or there is a fundamental contribution , which is missing in the way the gpds are parametrized in the gk and vgg models .",
    "the clas collaboration has measured the largest ever set of data for the exclusive electroproduction on the proton of the vector mesons @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "figure [ tslopes ] shows the slope of the differential cross section @xmath27 for the @xmath0 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels as a function of @xmath16 ( in the top part ) and as a function of @xmath14 ( in the bottom part ) .",
    "one can see the same trends of this slope , @xmath28 , for all mesons channels , which can be interpreted in simple and intuitive terms in the following way :    * @xmath28 increases with @xmath16 : the size of the nucleon increases as one probes the high @xmath16 values ( i.e. the sea quarks ) , which could mean that the sea quarks tend to extend to the periphery of the nucleon .",
    "* @xmath28 decreases with @xmath14 : as we go to large @xmath14 , the resolution of the probe increases and we tend to see smaller and smaller objects .     as a function of @xmath16 ( on the top ) and as a function of @xmath14 ( on the bottom ) for the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath0 channels.,width=604 ]",
    "we have presented ( preliminary ) first ever measurement of cross sections for the exclusive electroproduction of @xmath0 on the proton using the clas detector at jlab .",
    "these cross sections can be interpreted with two approaches :    * hadronic approach : the jml model describes well most of the features of the @xmath0 cross sections up to @xmath29 gev@xmath30 .",
    "* partonic approach : gpd models fail to describe longitudinal @xmath0 cross sections especially for low @xmath16",
