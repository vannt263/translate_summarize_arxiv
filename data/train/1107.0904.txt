    "<S> the iron - based superconductors are particularly noteworthy , and have attracted extensive interest since the discovery of la[o@xmath4f@xmath5$]feas in 2008 . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite the nature of this coexistence is poorly understood . in general , a subdominant order parameter can emerge locally in regions where the dominant order vanishes or is suppressed.@xcite recent experiments in the iron arsenides suggest that sc and afm order parameters are indeed spatially modulated on a microscopic scale.@xcite    among the iron based superconductors , the afe@xmath1as@xmath1 ( a = ca , sr and ba ) materials are of particular interest because large single crystals of these oxygen - free compounds can be easily synthesized.@xcite these materials undergo a tetragonal to orthorhombic transition followed by an afm state upon cooling.@xcite both chemical doping and applied pressure suppress the magnetostructural order of the parent compounds and give rise to sc , and the phase diagrams are similar to those of other unconventional superconductors.@xcite the cafe@xmath1as@xmath1 system is noteworthy because sc is induced at only 0.4 gpa ( non - hydrostatic ) , whereas the sr and ba materials require 2.8 and 2.5 gpa , respectively.@xcite    in this paper we present evidence for coexisting filamentary sc and afm in the undoped parent compound cafe@xmath1as@xmath1 , in which the sc order remains localized within afm domain walls ( dws ) . </S>",

    "<S> it is worth noting that this low temperature anomaly around 10 k is about the same for the maximum @xmath87 of the material with applied pressure.@xcite furthermore , it is present not only in cafe@xmath1as@xmath1 , but also in the other members of the afe@xmath1as@xmath1 family . </S>",
    "<S> for example , bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 at ambient pressure displays a broad maximum in the resistivity around 20 k , and pressure studies show that even very moderate uniaxial stress can induce at least filamentary sc and a maximum @xmath87 around that temperature.@xcite      enhanced superfluid density at dws may be a natural consequence of the coupling between sc and afm orders . indeed , model calculations exhibit an enhanced local density of states and superconducting order at twin boundaries in the iron pnictides.@xcite it is therefore not surprising that superconductivity could nucleate at _ antiphase _ domain boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fact that the emergence of sc coincides with the freezing of the afm dws is striking , and implies that the former is driven by the latter . </S>",
