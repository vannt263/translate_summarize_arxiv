    "the no - slip boundary condition , i.e. , zero relative tangential velocity between the fluid and solid at the interface , serves as a cornerstone in continuum hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "although fluid slipping is generally detected in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations for microscopically small systems at high flow rate @xcite , the no - slip boundary condition still works well for macroscopic flows at low flow rate .",
    "this is due to the navier boundary condition which actually accounts for the slip observed in md simulations @xcite .",
    "this boundary condition , proposed by navier in 1823 @xcite , introduces a slip length @xmath0 and assumes that the amount of slip is proportional to the shear rate in the fluid at the solid surface : @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the slip velocity at the surface , measured relative to the ( moving ) wall , @xmath3 $ ] is the tensor of the rate of strain , and @xmath4 denotes the outward surface normal ( directed out of the fluid ) .",
    "according to the navier boundary condition , the slip length is defined as the distance from the fluid - solid interface to where the linearly extrapolated tangential velocity vanishes ( see fig . [ nbc1823 ] ) .",
    "typically , @xmath0 ranges from a few angstroms to a few nanometers @xcite . for a flow of characteristic length @xmath5 and velocity @xmath6 ,",
    "the slip velocity is on the order of @xmath7 .",
    "this explains why the navier boundary condition is practically indistinguishable from the no - slip boundary condition in macroscopic flows where @xmath8 .",
    "it has been well known that the no - slip boundary condition is not applicable to the moving contact line ( mcl ) where the fluid - fluid interface intersects the solid wall @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ cl ] for both the static and moving contact lines ) .",
    "the problem may be simply stated as follows . in the two - phase immiscible flow where one",
    "fluid displaces another fluid , the contact line appears to `` slip '' at the solid surface , in direct violation of the no - slip boundary condition .",
    "furthermore , the viscous stress diverges at the contact line if the no - slip boundary condition is applied everywhere along the solid wall .",
    "this stress divergence is best illustrated in the reference frame where the fluid - fluid interface is time - independent while the wall moves with velocity @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ cl]b ) . as the fluid velocity has to change from @xmath6 at the wall ( as required by the no - slip boundary condition ) to zero at the fluid - fluid interface ( which is static ) ,",
    "the viscous stress varies as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the viscosity and @xmath11 is the distance along the wall away from the contact line .",
    "obviously , this stress diverges as @xmath12 because the distance over which the fluid velocity changes from @xmath6 to zero tends to vanish as the contact line is approached .",
    "in particular , this stress divergence is non - integrable ( the integral of @xmath13 yields @xmath14 ) , thus implying infinite viscous dissipation .    over the years",
    "there have been numerous models and proposals aiming to resolve the incompatibility of the no - slip boundary condition with the mcl .",
    "for example , there have been the kinetic adsorption / desorption model by blake @xcite , the fluid slip models by hocking @xcite , by huh and mason @xcite , and by zhou and sheng @xcite , and the cahn - hilliard - van der waals models by seppecher @xcite , by jacqmin @xcite , and by chen _",
    "_ @xcite . in the kinetic adsorption / desorption model by blake @xcite ,",
    "the role of molecular processes was investigated .",
    "a deviation of the dynamic contact angle from the static contact angle was shown to be responsible for the fluid / fluid displacement at the mcl . in the slip model by hocking @xcite , the effect of a slip coefficient ( slip length ) on the flow in the neighborhood of the contact line was examined .",
    "two slip models were used by huh and mason @xcite : model i for classical slippage assumes the slip velocity is proportional to the shear stress exerted on the solid ; model ii for local slippage assumes that over a ( small ) distance the liquid slips freely where fluid stress vanishes , but thereafter the liquid / solid bonding has been completed and the no - slip boundary condition is applied . in the slip model by zhou and sheng @xcite ,",
    "the incompressible navier - stokes equation was solved using a prescribed tangential velocity profile as the boundary condition , which exponentially interpolates between the complete - slip at the contact line and the no - slip far from the contact line .",
    "the cahn - hilliard - van der waals models by seppecher @xcite , by jacqmin @xcite , and by chen _",
    "_ @xcite suggested a resolution when perfect no - slip is retained . with the fluid - fluid interface modeled to be diffuse ,",
    "the contact line can thus move relative to the solid wall through diffusion rather than convection .",
    "all the above models are at least mathematically valid because the divergence of stress has been avoided , either by introducing some molecular process to drive the contact line @xcite , or by allowing slip to occur @xcite , or by modeling a diffuse fluid - fluid interface @xcite .",
    "pismen and pomeau have presented a rational analysis of the hydrodynamic phase field ( diffuse interface ) model based on the lubrication approximation @xcite .",
    "the most usual ( and natural ) approach to resolve the stress divergence has been to allow slip at the solid wall close to the contact line .",
    "in fact , molecular dynamics ( md ) studies have clearly demonstrated the existence of fluid slipping in the molecular - scale vicinity of the mcl @xcite .",
    "however , the exact rule that governs this relative slip has eluded numerous prior attempts . as a matter of fact",
    ", none of the existing models has proved successful by quantitatively accounting for the contact - line slip velocity profile observed in md simulations . in a hybrid approach by hadjiconstantinou @xcite",
    ", the md slip profile was used as the boundary condition for finite - element continuum calculation .",
    "the continuum results so obtained match the corresponding md results , therefore demonstrating the feasibility of hybrid algorithm @xcite .",
    "but the problem concerning the boundary condition governing the contact - line motion was still left unsolved .    in this paper",
    "we first present an introductory review of the problem , including ( 1 ) the origin of the stress singularity , ( 2 ) the ad hoc introduction of the slip boundary condition , ( 3 ) the md evidence of fluid slipping , ( 4 ) the gap between the existing md results and a continuum hydrodynamic description , and ( 5 ) a preliminary account on how to bridge the md results and a continuum description .",
    "we then present a detailed review of our recent results on the contact - line motion in immiscible two - phase flow , from md simulations to continuum hydrodynamics calculations @xcite . in our md simulations ,",

    "[ remarks ] .",
    "hua and scriven @xcite considered a simple model for the immiscible two - phase flow near a mcl .",
    "a flat solid surface is moving with steady velocity @xmath6 in its own plane and a flat fluid - fluid interface , formed between two immiscible phases a and b , intersects the solid surface at a contact line ( see fig .",
    "[ singularity ] ) .",
    "the contact line is taken as the origin of a polar coordinate system @xmath15 , in which the contact angle is @xmath16 .",
    "the two - dimensional flow of newtonian and incompressible fluids is dominated by viscous stress for @xmath17 , where @xmath10 is the viscosity and @xmath18 the mass density . in the viscous flow approximation ,",
    "the navier - stokes equation is linearized and the steady flow is solved from the biharmonic equation for the stream function @xmath19 : @xmath20 the boundary conditions to be imposed at @xmath21 ( solid surface ) and @xmath22 ( fluid - fluid interface ) are : ( i ) vanishing normal component of velocity at the solid surface and fluid - fluid interface , ( ii ) continuity of tangential velocity at the fluid - fluid interface , ( iii ) continuity of tangential viscous stress at the fluid - fluid interface , ( iv ) no slip at the solid surface . here",
    "conditions ( i)(iii ) are well justified while ( iv ) is usually taken as a postulate of continuum hydrodynamics .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition can be justified _ a posteriori _ in macroscopic flow by checking the correctness of its consequences . in the present model",
    ", however , it leads to physically incorrect results for stress , in the microscopic vicinity of the mcl .",
    "the similarity solution of the biharmonic equation is in the form of @xmath23 in which the eight constants ( 4 for phase a and 4 for phase b ) are determined by the eight boundary conditions in ( i)(iv ) .",
    "what hua and scriven found is that the shear stress and pressure fields vary as @xmath24 and hence increase in magnitude without limit as the contact line @xmath25 is approached . as a consequence ,",
    "the total tangential force exerted on the solid surface , which is an integral of the tangential stress along the surface , is logarithmically infinite .",
    "that indicates a singularity in viscous dissipation , which is physically unacceptable .",
    "obviously , the hua - scriven model is defective in the immediate vicinity of the mcl .",
    "this is also seen from the normal stress difference across the fluid - fluid interface , which varies as @xmath24 as well . according to the laplace s equation",
    ", the interface curvature should increase rapidly as the contact line ( @xmath25 ) is approached , in order to balance the normal stress difference by curvature force .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with the assumption of a flat fluid - fluid interface .",
    "nevertheless , the flow field solved from the hua - scriven model may approximately describe the asymptotic region at a large distance from the contact line ( where the viscous flow approximation is still valid ) . in that region ,",
    "the no - slip boundary condition is considered valid and the fluid - fluid interface is almost flat , due to the reduced stress .",
    "the deficiency of the hua - scriven model results from the incompatibility of the no - slip boundary condition with a mcl : no slip means @xmath26 at the solid surface @xmath27 where @xmath28 while at @xmath25 the mcl requires a perfect slip .",
    "that is , the no - slip boundary condition leads to a velocity discontinuity at the mcl . in order to remove the stress singularity at the mcl , while retaining the newtonian behavior of stress , the continuity of velocity field must be restored . for this purpose ,",
    "a slip profile can be introduced to continuously interpolate between the complete slip at the mcl and the no - slip boundary condition that must hold at regions far away .",
    "dussan v. @xcite considered a plate of infinite extent either inserted into or withdrawn from a semi - infinite domain of fluid at a constant velocity @xmath29 ( see fig .",

    ".    the slip boundary condition must continuously interpolate between the complete slip at the mcl ( @xmath25 ) and the no - slip boundary condition at @xmath49 : @xmath50 however , the form of @xmath47 in the intermediate region , where @xmath6 varies from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , is unknown .",
    "three different slip boundary conditions were used for @xmath47 , in order to assess the sensitivity of the overall flow field to the form of the slip boundary condition .",
    "they are @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a length scale called the slip length ( not the one defined in the navier boundary condition ) .",
    "it was found that on the slip length scale the flow fields are quite different whereas on the meniscus length scale , i.e. , the length scale on which almost all fluid - mechanical measurements are performed , all the flow fields are virtually the same .",
    "that is , identical macroscopic flow behaviors are expected from different slipping models .      according to the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite , only in the microscopic slip region ( of length scale @xmath55 ) can different slip models be distinguished .",
    "this makes the experimental verification of a particular slip model very difficult because experiments usually probe distances ( @xmath56 ) much larger than @xmath54 .",
    "naturally , computer experiments become very useful in elucidating the problem @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium md simulations were carried out to investigate the fluid motion in the vicinity of the mcl , in both the poiseuille - flow @xcite and couette - flow @xcite geometries . in these md simulations ,",
    "interactions between fluid molecules were modeled with the lennard - jones potential , modified to segregate immiscible fluids .",
    "the confining walls were constructed with a molecular structure .",
    "wall - fluid interactions were also modeled with the lennard - jones potential , with energy and length scales different from those of the fluid - fluid interactions . in the simulations performed in the couette geometry @xcite",
    ", two immiscible fluids were confined between two planar walls parallel to the @xmath57 plane and a shear flow was induced by moving the two solid walls in @xmath58 directions at constant speed @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ couette - robbins ] ) .",
    "steady - state velocity fields were obtained from the time average of fluid molecular velocities in small bins .",
    "there was clean evidence for a slip region in the vicinity of the mcl : appreciable slip occurs within a length scale @xmath59 , where @xmath44 is the length scale in the fluid - fluid lennard - jones potential , and at the mcl the slip is near - complete .",
    "far from the interfaces , viscous damping makes the flow insensitive to the fast variations near the interfaces , and hence uniform shear flow was observed , with a negligible amount of slip .",
    "therefore , md simulations provide evidence for a cutoff , below which the no - slip boundary condition breaks down , introduced phenomenologically in various slip models to remove the stress singularity .",
    "however , the exact boundary condition that governs the observed slip was left unresolved . in particular ,",
    "a breakdown of local hydrodynamics in the molecular scale slip region was suggested @xcite , considering the extreme velocity variations there .",
    "the navier slip model assumes that the amount of slip is proportional to the tangential component of the stress tensor , @xmath60 , in the fluid at the solid surface . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the microscopic value of @xmath60 was directly measured .",
    "a comparison to the slip profile is roughly consistent with the navier slip model .",

    "+ ( ii ) the tangential stress in the navier model is not merely viscous .",
    "+ ( iii ) the interfacial tension plays an important role in governing the contact - line slip in immiscible two - phase flows .",
    "+ ( iv ) there is no breakdown of local hydrodynamics .",
    "for a cylindrical capillary of radius @xmath62 , if the steady displacement is sufficiently slow , then the pressure drop across the moving fluid - fluid interface is given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the interfacial tension , and @xmath65 is an appropriate dynamic contact angle . at equilibrium ,",
    "the pressure drop is given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the equilibrium contact angle .",
    "in general , @xmath65 and @xmath68 differ .",
    "physically , @xmath69 measures the change of the interfacial free energy at the fluid - solid interface when the fluid - fluid interface moves relative to the wall , and @xmath70 measures the external work done to the system .",
    "therefore , the difference @xmath71 is a measure of the dissipation due to the presence of the mcl .    let s consider a displacement of fluid 2 by fluid 1 over distance @xmath72 ( see fig .",

    "in order to find a relation between the displacement velocity @xmath83 and the unbalanced young force @xmath84 , two classes of models have been proposed to describe the contact line motion : a ) an eyring approach , based on the molecular adsorption / desorption processes at the contact line @xcite .",

    "[ kinetic]a ) . viewed on a molecular scale ,",
    "the three - phase line is actually a fluctuating three - phase zone , where adsorbed molecules of one fluid ( at the solid surface ) interchange with those of the other , either by migration at the solid surface or through the contiguous bulk phases . in equilibrium",
    "the net rate of exchange will be zero .",
    "for a three - phase zone moving relative to the solid wall ( fig .",
    "[ kinetic]a ) , the net displacement , driven by the unbalanced young force @xmath85 , is due to a nonzero net rate of exchange . let @xmath86 be the interfacial thickness , @xmath44 be the area of an adsorption site , and @xmath87 be the hopping distance of molecules .",
    "the force per adsorption site is approximately @xmath88 and the energy shift over distance @xmath87 is approximately @xmath89 ( see fig . [",

    "this energy shift leads to two different rates @xmath90 and @xmath91 : @xmath92,\\ ] ] for forward and backward hopping events , respectively . here",
    "@xmath93 is an activation energy for hopping .",
    "it follows that the velocity of the mcl is @xmath94 .",
    "for very small @xmath84 , @xmath95 .",
    "blake s kinetic model shows that fluid slipping can be induced by the unbalanced young force at the contact line .",
    "therefore , it emphasizes the role of interfacial tension , though not in a hydrodynamic formulation . on the contrary , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "considered the viscous shear stress as the only driving force .",
    "in fact a large discrepancy was found between the shear rate and the microscopic value of the tangential stress ( the driving force according to the navier slip model ) . in this paper",

    "this boundary condition is a constitutive equation that _ locally _ relates the amount of slip to the shear rate at the solid surface , though in most of the reported simulations , the hydrodynamics involves no spatial variation along the solid surface .",

    "the thickness of this boundary layer , @xmath97 , must be of molecular scale , within the range of wall - fluid interactions .",
    "now we show that the slip length @xmath0 is defined based on a linear law for tangential wall force and the newton s law for shear stress .",
    "hydrodynamic motion of fluid at the solid surface is measured by the slip velocity @xmath98 in the @xmath11 direction , defined relative to the ( moving ) wall .",

    "physically , this force represents a time - averaged effect of wall - fluid interactions , to be incorporated into a hydrodynamic slip boundary condition .",
    "the linear law for @xmath99 is expressed by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is called the slip coefficient and the minus sign means the fluid - solid coupling is viscous ( frictional ) . for the boundary layer of molecular thickness , the tangential wall force @xmath99 must be balanced by the tangential fluid force @xmath102 , where the integral is over the @xmath103-span of the boundary layer ( see fig",

    "to summarize , the hydrodynamic viscous coupling between fluid and solid is actually measured by the slip coefficient @xmath101 .",
    "the navier boundary condition , in which the slip length is introduced , is due to the newton s law for viscous shear stress .",
    "for very weak viscous coupling between fluid and solid , @xmath115 , and thus @xmath116 , making @xmath117 : the fluid - solid interface becomes a free surface .",
    "a number of md studies have shown that for single - phase flows , the navier boundary condition is valid in describing the fluid slipping at solid surface @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that it can also describe the partial slip observed in the single - phase region near the mcl @xcite . however , according to the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , the navier boundary condition failed even in the single - phase region : the velocity gradient @xmath61 was not proportional to the amount of slip .",
    "this discrepancy was attributed to a breakdown of local hydrodynamics , considering the very large velocity variations observed near the mcl . here",
    "we present a heuristic discussion , to explain why such a discrepancy is expected even if the navier boundary condition actually works for the single - phase region .",
    "first , the success of the hybrid approaches outlined below strongly indicates that local hydrodynamics does nt break down in the slip region . in ref .",

    "fluid - fluid interfaces could be approximated by planes .",
    "the navier - stokes equation was solved for the simplified geometry . for this purpose ,",
    "the tangential velocity along fluid - fluid interface was set to be zero ( according to the simulation results ) and the slip velocity @xmath120 ( measured relative to the moving wall ) was specified as a function of distance @xmath62 from the mcl : @xmath121 $ ] , with @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the lower and upper walls , respectively .",

    "recently , an improved hybrid approach has been used to reproduce the md simulation results for contact - line motion in a poiseuille geometry @xcite .    to further test the validity of continuum modeling ,",

    "[ corner - flow ] ) .",
    "the fluid is newtonian and incompressible .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition is applied at the vertical plane and the navier boundary condition applied at the horizontal plane .",
    "the kinematic condition of vanishing normal component of velocity at the solid surface requires @xmath128 at the vertical plane and @xmath129 at the horizontal plane , and hence @xmath130 at the intersection @xmath131 , which is taken as the origin of the coordinate system @xmath132 .",

    "\\(2 ) by explicitly taking into account the long - range wall - fluid interactions , our hydrodynamic model for two - phase immiscible flow at the solid surface can be used to investigate the dry spreading of a pure , nonvolatile liquid , attracted towards the solid by long - range van der waals forces @xcite .",
