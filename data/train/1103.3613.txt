    "the problem of heat conductivity in low dimensional systems attracts much attention in last decades ( see review @xcite ) and is motivated by the discovery of quasi - one - dimensional ( nanotubes , nanowires , etc . ) and two - dimensional ( graphen , graphan , etc . ) systems .",
    "the modern theory of heat conductivity was initiated by the celebrated preprint of e.  fermi , j.  pasta , and s.  ulam @xcite , though the primary aim was `` _ of establishing , experimentally , the rate of approaching to the equipartition of energy among the various degrees of freedom _ '' .",
    "subsequent investigations demonstrated wide area of consequences in many physical and mathematical phenomena ( see reviews in special issues of journals chaos @xcite and lecture notes in physics @xcite devoted to the 50th anniversary of the fpu preprint ) .",
    "the dynamical properties of nonlinear systems in microcanonical ensemble ( total energy @xmath11 const ) were thoroughly analyzed .",
    "it allows to investigate the dynamics and to get exact results ( soliton @xcite and breather @xcite solutions ) , to analyze regular and stochastic regimes and to find the corresponding thresholds .",
    "the fpu preprint also initiated the investigations in the field of `` experimental mathematics '' @xcite .",
    "about ten decades ago p.  debye argued that the nonlinearity can be responsible for the finite value of heat conductivity in insulating materials @xcite .",
    "but modern analysis shows that it is not always the case .",
    "there are many examples where the coefficient of heat conductivity @xmath12 diverges with the increasing system size @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "most of momentum conserving one - dimensional nonlinear lattices with various types of nearest - neighbor interactions have this unusual property ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , some other systems ,  two- @xcite and three - dimensional lattices @xcite , polyethylene chain @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite have analogous property  diverging heat conductivity with the increasing size of the system",
    ".    there were some conjectures explaining the anomalous heat conductivity .",
    "generally speaking , whenever the equilibrium dynamics of a lattice can be decomposed into that of independent `` modes '' or quasi - particles , the system is expected to behave as an ideal thermal conductor @xcite .",
    "thereby , the existence of stable nonlinear excitations is expected to yield ballistic rather than diffusive transport . at low temperatures normal modes",
    "are phonons . at higher temperatures noninteracting `` gas '' of solitons or / and",
    "breathers starts to play more significant role , and m.  toda was the first who suggested the possibility of heat transport by solitons @xcite .",
    "though analytical expressions for solitons can be derived only for few continuum models described by partial differential equations , friesecke and pego in a series of recent papers @xcite made a detailed study of the existence and stability of solitary wave solutions on discrete lattices with the hamiltonian @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "it has been proven that the systems with this hamiltonian and with the following generic properties of nearest - neighbor interactions : @xmath20 has a family of solitary wave solutions which in the small amplitude , long - wavelength limit have a profile close to that of the kdv soliton .",
    "it was also shown @xcite that these solutions are asymptotically stable .",
    "thus most acceptable point of view on the origin of anomalous heat conductivity in nonlinear lattices is as follows : phonons are responsible for heat conductivity at low temperatures , and at high temperatures ",
    "solitons @xcite .",
    "rather confusing experimental and numerical results are demonstrated in literature about the dependence of heat conductivity on different parameters ,  model under consideration , types of boundary conditions , used thermostat and temperature . for instance ,",
    "temperature dependence of heat conductivity in carbon nanotubes decreases as @xmath21 at @xmath22 k @xcite ; experimentally is found @xcite that @xmath12 also decreases with the growth of temperature .",

    "but there exists firm theoretical background @xcite that the exponent @xmath28 in the dependence @xmath29 is the universal constant @xmath30 in momentum - conserving systems .",
