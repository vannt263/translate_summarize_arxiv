    "in a burning regime a reactor plasma must be heated mainly by the energetic particles produced by fusion . in dt",
    "fueled reactors in particular the @xmath0-particles produced will deposit , during slowing down , most of their energy to the plasma electrons .",
    "the highly energetic alpha particles are expected to destabilize mhd modes known are alfven eigenmodes .",
    "the strong nonlinear coupling among the energy deposition profile of the alpha particles , the new mhd instabilities , the bootstrap current and the plasma boundary , will make transport properties significatively different from those observed in current tokamak experiments.[1 ] hence , active control of particle densities and plasma temperature will be essential in order to regulate the power density and to suppress fluctuations in plasma parameters due to turbulence and/or changes in confinement modes .",
    "here we report the results of a burn control study of an iter feat - like tokamak by means of radial basis artificial neural networks with gaussian nodes in the hidden layer and sigmoidals in the output layer using a two - temperature volume - averaged 0-d model,[2 ] assuming the particle density is homogeneous throughout the plasma core , with electrons and ions having the same radial profile but different peak temperatures .",
    "in contrast with previous works[3 ] alpha particle thermalization time delay is taken into account in this model .",
    "it is assumed that the energy confinement time of the reactor follow the ipb98(y,2 ) scaling and that the helium ash particles confinement time @xmath1 , is independently estimated `` on - line '' .",
    "their current estimated value contains noise due to turbulence and/or intrinsic measurement uncertainties , and is fed , together with the electron and ions temperatures , the electron density and the helium ash fraction , into the rbnn controller .",
    "the control actions are implemented through the concurrent modulation of the refueling rate @xmath2 , the neutral he-4 injection rate @xmath3 , and the auxiliary heating power density deposited to the ions and the electrons , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , which can take values only within appropiate minima and maxima .",
    "the fusion reactor model considered here describes the time evolution of a quasineutral plasma composed of electrons , 50:50 d - t fuel , helium ash , a small amount of be and ar impurities , whose densities are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the total thermal energy is determined assuming maxwellian distribution of the particles : the electrons with a temperature profile @xmath11 , and all the ions with the same radial profile @xmath12 .",
    "the plasma heating takes place mainly by the thermalization of the alpha particles produced by the fusion reactions together with an external rf electron and ion heating , with a small contribution of joule heating .",

    "as pointed out in the introduction , during the thermalization process , approximately 85% of the energy of the fusion alphas is absorbed by the electrons and only 15% by the ions .",
