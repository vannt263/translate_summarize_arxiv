    "the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( btfr ) links the rotation velocity of a galaxy to its total baryonic mass ( @xmath6 ) and extends for 6 decades in @xmath6 @xcite . in a @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm )",
    "cosmology , the btfr must emerge from the complex process of galaxy formation , hence it is expected to show significant intrinsic scatter . using a semi - analytic galaxy - formation model , @xcite predicts a _ minimum _ intrinsic scatter of @xmath50.15 dex along the btfr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the majority of this scatter comes from the mass - concentration relation of dark matter ( dm ) halos , which is largely independent of baryonic processes and well - constrained by cosmological dm - only simulations @xcite .",
    "hence the btfr scatter provides a key test for @xmath0cdm .",
    "the btfr has been extensively studied using observations from radio interferometers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and single - dish telescopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "radio interferometers can spatially resolve the kinematics in nearby galaxies , providing high - quality rotation curves ( rcs ) . despite being limited to small galaxy samples",
    ", the study of rcs has provided key insights on the btfr .",
    "primarily , the btfr scatter is minimized using the velocity along the flat part ( @xmath7 ) , which extends well beyond the optical galaxy @xcite . presumably , @xmath7 is set by the dm halo and closely relates to its virial velocity .",
    "single - dish surveys provide large samples for btfr studies ( thousands of objects ) , which are most useful to estimate galaxy distances and investigate local flows @xcite . when interpreted in a galaxy formation context",
    ", however , they are prone to systematic effects because rotation velocities from line - widths do not necessarily correspond to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "studies using line - widths generally reports shallower btfr slopes ( @xmath53 ) than those using @xmath7 ( @xmath54 ) , leading to drastically different interpretations @xcite .",
    "studies based on h@xmath8 @xcite or co @xcite observations may present similar issues , since h@xmath8 and co discs are typically less extended than discs and their maximum velocities may not be tracing @xmath7 .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the btfr using a sample of 118 galaxies with data of the highest quality : ( i ) extended rotation curves providing precise measurements of @xmath7 , and ( ii ) spitzer surface photometry at 3.6  @xmath1 m providing the optimal tracer of the stellar mass .",
    "this work is based on the sparc ( spitzer photometry & accurate rotation curves ) dataset , which will be presented in detail in lelli et al .",
    "( in prep . ) . in short , we collected more than 200 high - quality rcs of disc galaxies from previous compilations , large surveys , and individual studies .",

    "* objects ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* objects ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* objects ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* objects ) .",
    "the rcs were derived using similar techniques : fitting a tilted ring model to the velocity field @xcite and/or using position - velocity diagrams along the disc major axis @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we searched the spitzer archive for 3.6@xmath1 m images of these galaxies .",
    "we found 173 objects with useful [ 3.6 ] data .",
    "we derived surface brightness profiles and asymptotic magnitudes using the archangel software @xcite , following the same procedures as @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness profiles will be presented elsewhere ; here we simply use asymptotic magnitudes at [ 3.6 ] to estimate stellar masses ( @xmath9 ) .    for the sake of this study",
    ", we exclude starburst dwarf galaxies ( 8 objects from @xcite and holmberg  ii from @xcite ) because they have complex kinematics and are likely involved in recent interactions @xcite .",
    "this reduces our starting sample to 164 objects .",
    "empirically , the velocity along the flat part of the rc minimizes the scatter in the btfr @xcite . the choice of velocities at some photometric radius , like 2.2 @xmath10 ( the disc scale length , * ? ? ? * ) or @xmath11 ( the radius encompassing 80@xmath12 of the i - band light , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lead to relations with larger scatter .",
    "this can be simply understood .",
    "for some low - mass , gas - dominated galaxies , these radii may occur along the rising part of the rc @xcite . for high - mass , bulge - dominated galaxies",
    ", they may occur along the declining part of the rcs @xcite .",
    "these photometric radii do not necessarily imply a consistent measurement of the rotation velocity due to the different distribution of baryons within galaxies .",
    "conversely , @xmath7 appears insensitive to the detailed baryonic distribution , being measured at large enough radii to encompass the bulk of the baryonic mass .",
    "@xmath7 represents our best proxy for the halo virial velocity .",
    "we estimate @xmath7 using a simple automated algorithm .",
    "we start by calculating the mean of the two outermost points of the rc : @xmath13 and require that @xmath14 if the condition is fulfilled , the algorithm includes @xmath15 in the estimate of @xmath16 and iterates to the next velocity point .",
    "when the condition is falsified , the algorithm returns @xmath17 .",
    "this algorithm returns similar values of @xmath7 as previously employed techniques based on the logarithmic slope @xmath18 @xcite , but is more stable against small radial variations in the rc .",
    "galaxies that do not satifsy the condition at the first iteration are rejected , hence we only consider rcs that are flat within @xmath55@xmath12 over at least three velocity - points .",
    "this excludes 36 galaxies with rising rcs ( @xmath520@xmath12 ) , reducing the sample to 129 objects .",
    "the error on @xmath7 is estimated as @xmath19 where ( i ) @xmath20 is the random error on each velocity - point along the flat part of the rc , quantifying non - circular motions and kinematic asymmetries between the two sides of the disc ; ( ii ) @xmath21 is the dispersion around @xmath16 , quantifying the degree of flatness of the rc ; and ( iii ) @xmath22 is the error on the outer disc inclination @xmath23 .",
    "high - quality velocity fields can be used to obtain kinematic estimates of @xmath23 and trace possible warps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is another advantage of interferometric surveys over single - dish ones , since the latter must rely on photometric inclinations that depend on the assumed stellar - disc thickness and may be inappropriate for warped discs .",
    "inclination corrections become very large for face - on discs due to the @xmath24 dependence , hence we exclude galaxies with @xmath25 reducing the sample to 118 galaxies .",
    "clearly , this does not introduce any selection effects since galaxy discs are randomly oriented across the sky , but decreases the mean error on @xmath7 to @xmath50.03 dex .",

    "* ) , and @xmath2 is the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "several studies suggest that @xmath2 is almost constant in the near infrared ( [ 3.6 ] or @xmath29-band ) over a range of galaxy types and masses .",
    "a small scatter of @xmath50.1 dex is consistently found using different approaches : stellar population synthesis models @xcite , resolved stellar populations @xcite , and the vertical velocity dispersion of galaxy discs @xcite .",
    "large inconsistencies persist in the overall normalization @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we assume that @xmath2 is constant among galaxies and systematically explore the btfr for different @xmath2 .    in disc galaxies",
    "@xmath27 is typically dominated by atomic gas ( probed by observations ) .",
    "the molecular gas content can be estimated from co observations assuming a co - to - h@xmath30 conversion factor , which can vary from galaxy to galaxy depending on metallicity or other properties .",
    "co emission is often undetected in low - mass , metal - poor galaxies @xcite .",
    "luckily , molecules generally are a minor dynamical component , contributing less than 10@xmath12 to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "similarly , warm / hot gas is negligible in the disc @xcite .",
    "hence we assume @xmath31 , where the factor 1.33 takes the contribution of helium into account .",
    "we note that any contribution from `` dark gas '' ( molecular and/or ionized ) is implicitly included in @xmath2 as long as this scales with @xmath9 .",

    "galaxy distances ( @xmath36 ) and corresponding errors ( @xmath37 ) deserve special attention .",

    "the majority of these distances ( 24/32 ) are drawn from the extragalactic distance database @xcite .",

    ", one should also consider the cluster depth ( @xmath52.3  mpc , @xcite ) , hence we adopt @xmath39  mpc , giving an error of @xmath514@xmath12 .",
    "we consider two galaxies from @xcite as background / foreground objects : ngc  3992 , having @xmath40 mpc from a type - ia supernova @xcite , and ugc  6446 , laying near the cluster boundary in both space and velocity ( @xmath41 mpc from the hubble flow ) .",
    "3 .   60 objects have hubble - flow distances corrected for virgocentric infall ( as given by ned assuming @xmath42 km  s@xmath43  mpc@xmath43 ) .",
    "these are very uncertain for nearby galaxies where peculiar velocities may constitute a large fraction of the systemic velocities , but become more accurate for distant objects .",
    "considering that peculiar velocities may be as high as @xmath5500  km  s@xmath43 and @xmath44 has an uncertainty of @xmath57@xmath12 , we adopt the following errors : 30@xmath12 for @xmath45  mpc ; 25@xmath12 for @xmath46  mpc ; 20@xmath12 for @xmath47  mpc ; 15@xmath12 for @xmath48  mpc ; and 10@xmath12 for @xmath49  mpc .",

    "we systematically explore the btfr for different values of @xmath2 ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 @xmath4 in steps of 0.05 .",
    "values higher than 1 are ruled out by maximum - disc models of high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies ( lelli et al . in prep . ) .",
    "for each @xmath2 , we fit a straight line : @xmath53 we use the lts_linefit algorithm @xcite , which performs a least - square minimization considering errors in both variables and allowing for intrinsic scatter .",

    "figure  [ fig : ml ] ( top - left ) shows that @xmath54 decreases with @xmath2 and reaches a plateau at @xmath58 .",

    "@xcite used 45 galaxies that were selected for having @xmath67 ( assuming @xmath2 based on stellar population models ) . here",
    "we use a slightly different approach : we fit the btfr weighting each point by @xmath68 . in this way , galaxies with @xmath69 are 25 times more important in the fit than galaxies with @xmath70 . our results are shown in figure  [ fig : btfr ] for @xmath66 @xmath4 , using both standard error - weighted fits and @xmath71-weighted fits . the latter hints at a small , systematic increase of @xmath2 with @xmath72 or @xmath7 ( by @xmath50.1 dex ) in order to have symmetric residuals .",
    "in this letter we study the btfr using 118 galaxies with data of the highest quality : extended rcs tracing @xmath7 and spitzer photometry at 3.6  @xmath1 m tracing @xmath9 .",

    "the observed scatter reaches a broad minimum for @xmath73 , corresponding to nearly maximal stellar discs in hsb galaxies ; 2 .   for any reasonable value of @xmath2",

    "* ) ; 3 .",
    "the residuals around the btfr show no trend with galaxy size or surface brightness , providing a further challenge to galaxy formation models @xcite .    in a @xmath0cdm cosmology , the btfr results from an underlying correlation between the `` virial '' mass ( @xmath74 ) and `` virial '' velocity ( @xmath75 ) of the dm halo @xcite .",

    ", this relation has no intrinsic scatter . to map @xmath78 and @xmath75 into the observed btfr",
    ", we introduce the baryonic fraction @xmath79 and the factor @xmath80 , hence @xmath81 since the observed btfr has a slope higher than 3 , we infer that @xmath82 and/or @xmath83 systematically vary with @xmath6 .",
    "the presumed @xmath84 and @xmath85 relations are set by the galaxy formation process and must induce scatter on the observed btfr .",
    "the factor @xmath82 is determined by baryonic processes like gas inflows , reionization , stellar feedback and gas outflows .",
    "the factor @xmath83 , instead , is determined both by `` primordial '' halo properties ( mass - concentration relation ) and subsequent baryonic physics ( halo contraction due to baryonic infall or expansion due to stellar feedback ) .",
    "the mass - concentration relation has a well - established scatter of 0.11 dex from n - body simulations @xcite , driving scatter on @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath86 relation , proxy of a more fundamental @xmath87 relation , has an estimated scatter of @xmath50.1 - 0.2 dex @xcite , driving scatter on @xmath88 .",
    "since these two sources of scatter act in perpendicular directions on the btfr , we expect an intrinsic scatter of _ at least _ @xmath50.15 - 0.2 dex .",
    "for example , @xcite uses a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation to reproduce the btfr and predicts a minimum intrinsic scatter of 0.15 dex . in his model ,",
    "most of the expected scatter ( @xmath573@xmath12 ) comes from the mass - concentration relation , while the remaining fraction comes from variations in the halo spin parameter .",
    "hence , a value of @xmath50.15 is a _ lower limit _ for @xmath0cdm cosmology : it is hard to imagine that stochastic baryonic processes would conspire to reduce the scatter expected from the basic structure of dm halos .",
    "conversely , the diverse formation histories of galaxies should lead to significant variations in @xmath82 at a given halo mass @xcite , hence a scatter larger than 0.15 dex would be a more natural result .",
    "we find that the btfr intrinsic scatter is @xmath50.11 dex , below @xmath0cdm expectations . for galaxies with accurate distances ,",
    "the observed scatter is already small ( @xmath50.18 dex ) , thus there is little room for having overestimated the errors .",
    "moreover , @xmath89 dex is comparable to the mean error on @xmath6 ( driven by the assumed uncertainty on @xmath2 ) , hence it should be considered as an observational _ upper limit_.    one may wonder whether selection effects may artificially decrease the btfr scatter . for example , @xcite argued that the exclusion of low - mass galaxies with rising rcs may introduce a bias towards objects where the distribution is more extended with respect to the dm scale length .",
    "this is hardly the case . for low - mass bulgeless galaxies , rcs start to flatten at @xmath52  @xmath10 ( independently of mass or luminosity ) and",
    "reach a flat part beyond @xmath53  @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the presence or not of a flat part is mostly related to our ability to trace rcs out to large radii , where the column densities are low and the sensitivity of the observations decreases .",
    "hence , the exclusion of galaxies with rising rcs helps to _ avoid _ observational bias .",
    "we stress that our sample spans a large range in mass ( @xmath90 ) , size ( @xmath91 ) , surface brightness ( @xmath92 ) , gas fraction ( @xmath93 ) , and morphology ( s0 to i m ) .",
    "we are only excluding merging and interacting galaxies , since they show disturbed , out - of - equilibrium kinematics that would artificially inflate the scatter on the btfr .",
    "hence our results are representative for the general population of non - interacting galaxies in low - density environments ( field , groups , and diffuse clusters like ursa major ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the btfr is an open issue for the current cosmological model : the stochastic process of galaxy formation needs to reproduce a global relation with little ( if any ) intrinsic scatter and no dependence on galaxy structural parameters ."
