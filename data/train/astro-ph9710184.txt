    "much of our understanding of the physics and dynamics of accretion in x - ray binaries has been achieved mainly through the modeling and interpretation of their high energy photon spectra .",
    "the high energy emissions are believed to originate in the vicinity of the compact object and is considered to be due to the comptonization of soft photons by the high temperature ( @xmath0 k ) electrons heated by the dissipation of the accretion kinetic energy .",
    "this process has been studied extensively ( e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; hua & titarchuk 1995 ) and model photon spectra in analytic forms have been used , quite successfully , to fit the observed spectra of accreting sources , in the energy range of a few to a few hundred kev .",
    "these fits can then provide the values of the thomson optical depth @xmath1 and the temperature @xmath2 of the hot electrons . while the parameters so obtained are widely accepted as the true indication of the physical conditions prevailing in the region under consideration",
    ", one should keep in mind that the analytical formulas derived are based on several approximations .",
    "hua & titarchuk ( 1995 ) showed that in order for the analytical formulas to be valid , the optical depth @xmath1 and the electron temperature @xmath2 must be within certain limits and the initial distribution of source photons must satisfy certain requirements . furthermore , the analytical treatment can only by applied to the simplest geometries , typically spheres or disks with uniform temperature and density .",
    "obviously , these requirements are not realistic in most situations .",
    "for example , skibo & dermer ( 1996 ) and ling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that for some of the observed energy spectra , two zone models of different temperatures can significantly improve the energy spectral fits . along the same lines , kazanas et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter kht ) , motivated by considerations of the accretion dynamics and the variability of the observed light curves as manifest in the form of power spectra ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1992 , cui et al .",
    "1997b ) , introduced a model consisting of an extended comptonizing atmosphere in spherical geometry , with density profiles @xmath3 or @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance from the center of the spherical clouds .",
    "hua et al . ( 1997 , hereafter hkt ) further showed that the hard x - ray time lags and the sources coherence functions , derived from observations of x - ray binaries by ginga ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 , vaughan & nowak , 1997 ) , and also by more recent observations by rxte ( cui et al .",
    "1997b ) are consistent with the inhomogeneous models introduced by kht and inconsistent with the uniform ones .",
    "these more realistic models have more adjustable parameters and before they can be used to interpret the observational data , the question arises as to how the energy spectra resulting from such models depend on these extra parameters .",
    "an additional question is whether there exist any observational tests which can provide information concerning the inhomogeneity present in these more general models .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide answers to these questions .    in  2",
    ", we show how the radial density profiles of scattering clouds with a given optical depth and temperature can affect the emergent energy spectra . in  3 , we provide an example of spectral fitting of the cygnus x-1 data obtained in combination by cgro / batse and rxte / pca using model spectra corresponding to configurations of different density profiles . in  4 ,",
    "we show that x - ray time lags corresponding to these different models are sufficiently different to serve as a discriminator of these models , thus giving preference to a particular class of inhomogeneous model . in  5 , we present a simple analytic model which provides a transparent account of the numerical results .",
    "finally , in  6 we provide a summary and conclusions of our results and we discuss the implication of these models for the interpretation of observational data .",
    "in the present study we concentrate on the comptonization process in hot electron clouds with density profiles of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a free parameter ; @xmath5 is the radial distance from the center of a spherical cloud ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are radii of the inner and outer edges of the extended non - uniform `` atmosphere '' respectively .",
    "the central core is assumed to be uniform and its density is @xmath10 , which may not necessarily equal to @xmath11 .    for illustration purposes , we have calculated the energy spectra emerging from clouds with the same total optical depth @xmath12 and electron temperature @xmath13 kev but different density profiles , namely @xmath14 , 1 and 0 in eq .",
    "the first two profiles represent the dynamically more plausible free - fall ( @xmath14 ) density distribution such as implied by the advection - dominated accretion model suggested by narayan & yi ( 1994 ) and the accretion induced by the sort of radiative viscosity ( @xmath15 ) suggested by kht . for the uniform profile ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "traditionally used in spectral fitting because of its mathematical simplicity , we further assume that it has an electron density of the order @xmath17 @xmath18 and a size of the order @xmath19 light second , typical of the values thought appropriate for the conditions in the vicinity of the compact object in galactic accreting sources . for the other two profiles ,",
    "both central cores have radius @xmath20 light seconds . in the absence of detailed knowledge of this innermost part of accreting cloud , we simply assume it has uniform density @xmath10 such that its thomson optical depth @xmath21 .",
    "model energy spectra obtained using the monte carlo code of hua ( 1997 ) , developed to deal with photon propagation and compton scatterings in inhomogeneous media , for conditions appropriate for these density profiles are shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is seen that although the emissions are from clouds with the same optical depth and plasma temperature , their spectra are significantly different from each other . in general , for the same @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the greater the density gradient represented by @xmath7 , the softer the emergent photon energy spectrum for a given total thomson depth @xmath1 .",
    "this is because photons propagating in media with a density gradient are in an anisotropic environment  the outward scatterings have longer mean free path than the inward ones .",
    "consequently , clouds with greater density gradient are more difficult to trap the photons , leading to softer energy spectra .",
    "the above discussion indicates that the optical depth and plasma temperature alone are not sufficient to determine the spectrum due to the comptonization process .",
    "clouds with the same optical depth and temperature can lead to different comptonization spectra if they have different density distributions . on the other hand , clouds with different optical depths or temperature can lead to the same photon spectrum as long as their density profiles are properly chosen .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the following example of spectral fitting in which three photon spectra resulting from clouds with the same temperature but different optical depths and density profiles fit equally well a given set of observational data .",
    "the data are taken from table 2 of ling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which tabulates the spectrum of the blackhole candidate cyg x-1 at its @xmath22 state observed in late 1993 .",
    "ling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using a monte carlo simulation of comptonization in uniform density clouds , obtained a best - fit model corresponding to a spherical cloud with optical depth @xmath23 and temperature @xmath24 kev .",
    "the spectrum was obtained by comptonization of seed photons from a black body distribution of temperature @xmath25 kev .",
    "the source of photons was considered to lie outside the hot electron cloud and to be injected radially inward as suggested by skibo & dermer ( 1995 ) .",
    "here we re - fit the same data using a slightly different model with @xmath26 , @xmath13 kev and source photons at @xmath27 kev injected isotropically at the cloud center .",
    "the cloud is assumed to be uniform as in the previous fitting .",
    "the spectrum resulting from such a model is displayed in figure 2 ( dotted curve ) together with the data points .",
    "the reduced @xmath28 value is 10.3 with 11 degrees of freedom , not as low as the one obtained by ling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) but still perfectly acceptable .    in the same figure",
    ", we also display the monte carlo calculated spectra resulting from two other models which have the same plasma temperature @xmath13 kev but different optical depths @xmath1 and non - uniform density profiles .",
    "one of them is a cloud with density profile parameter @xmath15 and @xmath29 @xmath18 .",
    "its inner core has a uniform density and a radius @xmath30 light second with a thomson optical depth @xmath31 .",
    "the total optical depth of the cloud is 1 and the energy spectrum resulting from comptonization in such a cloud is displayed in figure 2 as the solid curve .",
    "the other model is a cloud with @xmath14 and @xmath32 @xmath18 .",
    "its uniform inner core has the same radius but a thomson optical depth @xmath33 .",
    "the total optical depth of the cloud is 0.7 and the energy spectrum from such a cloud is displayed in figure 2 as the dashed curve .",
    "it is seen that over the energy range from 20 to 200 kev , these spectra are almost identical to the dotted curve .",
    "in fact , the @xmath28 values are 7.8 and 8.1 respectively ( with 8 degrees of freedom ) . in other words , these two models are as good as the uniform one insofar as the spectral fits are concerned .",
    "since these spectra were produced by a monte carlo calculation , a few words about its statistical errors are in order .",
    "each of the spectra was obtained by following @xmath34 photons . by generating several such spectra under the same conditions but with a different initial random number seeds and by fitting the spectra to the same data",
    ", we were able to estimate the statistical uncertainty of the calculation .",
    "it was found that the standard deviation of the @xmath28 value introduced by the monte carlo statistics is less than 2 , which is small compared to the @xmath28 values obtained .",
    "this justifies the conclusion about the goodness of the fits .    in fig .",
    "2 we also plotted the pca ( circles ) and hexte ( dots ) data covering an energy range @xmath35 kev from rxte observations of cyg x-1 in its 1996 high state ( cui et al .",
    "1997a ) . by definition , the soft x - ray ( @xmath36 kev ) flux is high in the high state , but",
    "the hard flux is low .",
    "such a distinct anti - correlation between the soft and hard bands was confirmed by the simultaneous monitoring of cyg x-1 with the asm / rxte and batse ( cui et al .",
    "1997a , zhang et al . 1996 ) .",
    "cyg x-1 in the @xmath22 state , as defined by ling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , showed a similar batse flux .",
    "so it might have been in the high state as well in 1994 .",
    "unfortunately , no simultaneous soft x - ray coverage was available then to confirm it .",
    "on the other hand , the remarkable similarity in the observed x - ray spectral shape , as is evident from the figure , between these two observations 2.5 year apart also seems to suggest a common origin .",
    "if so , the results would imply that the high state spectrum of cyg x-1 ( and perhaps the high state itself ) is quite stable , except for a slight shift in the normalization ( part of which can be attributed to the uncertainty in the cross calibration between the rxte instruments and batse ) .",
    "although clouds with different density profiles can produce the same energy spectrum , at least over a given energy range , as long as they have properly chosen @xmath1 and @xmath2 , kht and hkt have shown that the time - variation properties of the sources are sensitive to the density distribution of the comptonizing atmosphere and therefore they can be used to distinguish the models of different density profiles . in fact , the inhomogeneous density profile models were conceived by kht in order to explain the observed temporal properties such as power spectral density ( psd ) and hard x - ray phase or time lags . in figure 3 , we show the time lags of the x - ray emission as a function of fourier period ( see e.g. van der klis et al .",
    "1987 ) resulting from the three model clouds which were used to produce the energy spectra shown in figure 2 .",
    "these were obtained using the monte carlo code by collecting the escaping photons according to their arrival time to the observer as well as their energy .",
    "the photons were collected in the two energy bands @xmath37 and @xmath38 kev in order to be directly compared to the observational data obtained by ginga ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 ) . in each energy band , the photons were collected into 4096 bins over 16 seconds , each @xmath39 seconds in length .",
    "the light curves so obtained were then used to calculate the time lags of the emission in the @xmath37 kev band with respect to that in the @xmath38 kev band .",
    "the time lag resulting from the uniform cloud ( dotted curve ) is obtained by further assuming the cloud has a density @xmath40 @xmath18 .",
    "it is seen that the lag decreases below the period @xmath41 second but becomes constant @xmath42 ms above it .",
    "this is because for emission from such a cloud , the hard x - ray lags are due to scatterings in a region with a mean free time of the order @xmath43 ms ( hua & titarchuk , 1996 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the time lag reflects this characteristic time .",
    "on the other hand , the time lag resulting from the cloud with @xmath15 density profile ( solid curve ) has a linear dependence on the fourier period ranging from 0.03 second up to @xmath44 second .",
    "there is a cutoff at the periods below the range due to the finite time resolution of our calculation . at periods",
    "@xmath45 seconds the curve levels off , indicating that the time lag of hard x - ray reaches its maximum of @xmath46 second .",
    "this is because the lags in this case are due to scatterings in a region with densities ranging from @xmath47 to @xmath48 @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , the probabilities for photons to scatter in each decade of density are equal ( kht ) .",
    "correspondingly , the scattering mean free time spans a range of four orders of magnitude . as a result ,",
    "the time lags also span a range of four orders of magnitude , and the level - off period roughly indicates the size of the cloud , which is 1 light second in this case .",
    "the time lag resulting from the cloud with @xmath14 density profile is also plotted in figure 3 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "it is seen that dependence of lag on period is weaker and the maximum time lag is only @xmath49 second , indicating that although the cloud extends to a radius of @xmath50 light second , because of the steep density gradient , there is virtually no photon scattering beyond a radius @xmath49 light second . a calculation based on the density profile of eq .",
    "( 1 ) indicates that the optical depth of the cloud for @xmath51 light second is @xmath52 of the total depth for @xmath14 , while in the case of @xmath15 , the corresponding percentage is @xmath53 .",
    "also plotted in figure 3 is the time lag observed from cyg x-1 between the same energy bands by ginga ( miyamoto et al .",
    "it is seen that , qualitatively , the nearly linear dependence of time lag on fourier period is best fitted by the curve representing the cloud with @xmath15 density profile .",
    "the curve for the cloud with @xmath14 density profile , because of its weaker dependence on the fourier period , obviously does not provide as good a fit to the data and could be considered excluded for this specific data set .",
    "it is also obvious that a uniform cloud model can be excluded , a conclusion reached also by miyamoto et al ( 1988 ) by comparing the time lag obtained based on the analytic formula of payne ( 1980 ) for a uniform cloud .",
    "the latter time lag corresponding to a density @xmath40 @xmath18 is plotted in the figure as a dash - dotted curve .",
    "the difference between the analytic curve and monte carlo result ( over one order of magnitude ) is mainly due to the relativistic electron temperature and small optical depth as explained in hua & titarchuk ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , the ginga data presented in fig . 3 were obtained in august 1987 , when cyg x-1 was in its low state .",
    "therefore , it may be considered inappropriate to compare them with the calculated time lags based on the cloud configuration used to fit the energy spectrum of the 1993 observation , when the source was in its high ( soft ) state . on the other hand , as pointed out in  3 , the rxte observations of cyg x-1 in 1996 ( cui et al .",
    "1997a ) not only provide data in its high ( soft ) state but also data whose spectrum is similar to that of the 1993 observation .",
    "the time lags of the rxte observation were reported in cui et al .",
    "( 1997b ) . as an example",
    ", here we use their results from observation # 6 for comparison , when the source was in its high ( soft ) state while the other two reported ( # 3 and # 15 ) were during the transitions .",
    "the fourier period dependence of the time lag of the energy band @xmath54 kev with respect to @xmath55 kev is plotted in figure 4 with the data points re - grouped into logarithmically uniform bins in fourier period .",
    "again , the linear dependence of the lag on the fourier period in the range @xmath56 second is evident .",
    "the lags between the same energy bands calculated for the three model clouds described above are also plotted in the figure .",
    "the shapes of the curves are similar to those in figure 3 , but the magnitudes of the lag are slightly smaller , clearly because of the smaller gap between the reference energy bands in this case .",
    "obviously , the cloud with @xmath15 is again favored by the observation .",
    "in addition to these cyg x-1 data , ginga data from gx399 - 4 during its very high state ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ) also show a nearly linear dependence of the hard x - ray time lags on the fourier period over the range from @xmath46 to @xmath57 seconds",
    ". the lags at low frequencies could be as large as @xmath50 second .",
    "more recently , cgro / osse data from the source gro j0422 + 32 ( grove et al 1997 ) show a similar dependence for photons in the energy band 75 @xmath58 175 kev with respect to those in the band @xmath59 kev over the fourier frequency range @xmath60 hz .",
    "the time lag reaches @xmath61 second and levels off at @xmath62 hz .",
    "therefore we have reason to believe that the nearly linear time lag dependence on fourier period is a common phenomenon shared by many accreting compact objects .",
    "the above comparisons for the cyg x-1 data , qualitative as they are , show that by detailed fitting to the observed time lag as a function of frequency or period , one can determine the density structure of the comptonizing cloud .",
    "more importantly , they show that , if in addition simultaneous spectral data are available , the combined analysis of spectral and temporal data from the same source can uniquely determine the physical size , density profile as well as optical depth , temperature of the plasma cloud responsible for the x - ray emissions . we are planning to do more detailed data fitting to the energy spectra , time lag and other properties observed simultaneously from cyg x-1 and other sources .",
    "the difference of the time lag curves resulting from comptonization in clouds with uniform and non - uniform density profiles , in particular the one with @xmath15 , can be better understood if we examine the detailed form of their corresponding high energy light curves in response to an instantaneous input of soft photons at their center . in kht",
    ", it was shown that the light curve resulting from comptonization in a uniform cloud is exponential in time while that from a cloud with @xmath15 density profile has a power law shape , with power index close to one which decreases with increasing total thomson depth and photon energy . in both cases",
    "there is a cutoff corresponding to the time scale characteristic of the photon escape time from the system @xmath63 .",
    "these light curves can be approximated very well analytically by the gamma distribution function @xmath64    where @xmath65 is time ; @xmath66 and @xmath67 are parameters determining the shape of the light curves .",
    "to2.0 in    ' '' ''    -0.2 truein to2.0 in    ' '' ''    the light curve from a uniform electron cloud corresponds to @xmath68 so that the gamma distribution function reduces to an exponential . because the cloud in this case is assumed to be confined to the vicinity of the compact object , the corresponding value for @xmath63 is of order of @xmath69 sec .",
    "the cloud with the @xmath15 density profile under consideration is much more extended spatially , with its outer radius at @xmath50 light second , corresponding to @xmath70 second , and with a value for @xmath71 small compared to 1 .",
    "the fourier transformation of @xmath72 is @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the gamma function ; @xmath75 is the fourier frequency and @xmath76 is the phase angle that we are interested in and    @xmath77    if we consider two light curves in two energy bands distinguished by the different values of @xmath71 and @xmath63 , say @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , the time lag between them will be given by their phase lag @xmath76 divided by the corresponding fourier frequency @xmath82 , i.e.    @xmath83 \\eqno(5)\\ ] ]    for large periods @xmath84 or @xmath85 , @xmath86 approaches the constant @xmath87 . on the other hand , for small @xmath84 , @xmath88 .",
    "the transition from latter to the former occurs at @xmath89 or @xmath90 . in our model for @xmath15 density profile , @xmath79 and @xmath91 second",
    "this explains what we see in figures 3 and 4 , namely for @xmath92 a few seconds , @xmath93 and the curve levels off for large @xmath84 .",
    "on the other hand , for the case of uniform cloud , @xmath94 ; @xmath79 and @xmath91 ms (  4 ) . as a result ,",
    "for large periods @xmath84 , @xmath86 approaches the constant @xmath95 , which is of the the order 1 millisecond . for small @xmath84 , @xmath96 .",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath97 second .    in figure 5a",
    ", we plot two pairs of light curves , one with @xmath98 @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the other with @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the former represents the light curves resulting from the cloud with @xmath15 density profile while the latter from a uniform one .",
    "the time lags between these two pairs of light curves are presented in figure 5b .",
    "it is seen that the light curve parameters @xmath71 and @xmath63 determine the shape of the time lag curve : for @xmath68 , or pure exponential light curves , the time lag is proportional to @xmath105 for small fourier period @xmath84 and turns to constant for large @xmath84 . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the time lag is proportional to @xmath84 for small @xmath84 and turns to constant for for large @xmath84 . in both cases , the level - off point is @xmath107 .",
    "however , the time lag resulting from the exponential light curves has no portion linear in @xmath84 .",
    "thus the existence of a linear portion in the time lag curves obtained from observations clearly favors the power law light curve . from kht , we know that power law light curve is a signature of the non - uniform density distribution of the source and the values of @xmath71 and @xmath63 are closely related to the physical size and density distribution of the source cloud .",
    "thus , under the assumptions of the present calculations ( i.e. comptonization as the main process of high energy emission , uniform temperature , non - uniform density ) the time dependence of the photon flux , or light curves , at various energies can be used to map the radial density distribution of the hot electron comptonizing cloud .",
    "this fact provides the possibility of deconvolution of the density structure of these clouds through timing analysis of their light curves .",
    "\\1 ) for a given total thompson depth of the comptonization cloud , @xmath1 , the electron density distribution can significantly affect the emergent spectrum . consequently , clouds of the same depth @xmath1 and electron temperature @xmath2 can lead to different comptonization spectra depending on their density distributions . on the other hand , clouds with different optical depths or temperature can lead to the same photon spectrum as long as their density profiles are properly chosen .",
    "in other words , analysis of energy spectra alone can not determine the optical depth @xmath1 of the cloud , if its density structure is unknown .",
    "consequently , all the @xmath1 and @xmath2 values obtained by the traditional way of fitting analytically or numerically calculated energy spectra with observational data are not the true reflection of these properties but only indicate the effective values of a uniform plasma cloud .",
    "\\2 ) the phase or time differences between x - rays in two energy bands as functions of the fourier frequency or period can provide additional , independent diagnostics of the light curve shapes and thereby of the density structure of the scattering medium .",
    "this is because the phase or time differences reflect the shape of the light curves , which in turn map the density profiles of the clouds . in the framework of comptonization ,",
    "the phase or time lags depend only on the physical size and density of the scattering medium .",
    "therefore the information they provide is independent of possible alternative influences other than compton scattering ; such influences would generally afflict the most common test of variability , namely the psd .",
    "for example , in timing analysis of the light curves in terms of shots , the corresponding psds depend on the shot distribution , morphology and modulation of their rate of injection .",
    "the time lag analysis is immune of all these influences .    therefore , combined analysis of spectral and temporal properties can yield knowledge not only about optical depth and plasma temperature but also about the physical size and density structure of the plasma clouds . when simultaneous observation of energy spectra and time variability , especially the time lags , from a source are available , fitting of data in the combined spectral and temporal domains such as those presented in this study , will provide less ambiguous information about these physical properties that are important in the understanding of the the dynamics of mass accretion onto the compact object"
