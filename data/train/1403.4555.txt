    "the study of ergodic properties of linear dynamical systems was launched by flytzanis in the paper @xcite and pursued in @xcite , leading to the obtention of necessary and sufficient conditions for operators on complex hilbert spaces to admit _ gaussian _ invariant measures with one of the above properties .",

    "a formally stronger property was considered in @xcite , and it was shown later on in @xcite that the two notions are in fact equivalent . the aforementioned result from @xcite states that any operator with a perfectly spanning set of unimodular eigenvectors admits a gaussian ergodic measure with full support . without the requirement that the measure should be gaussian ,",

    ", we shall consider measure - theoretic properties of linear operators outside of the gaussian framework .",
    "our main interest lies with the so - called _ frequently hypercyclic _ operators .",
    "frequent hypercyclicity , which was introduced in @xcite , is a strengthening of hypercyclicity which quantifies the frequency with which the orbit of a vector @xmath6 visits a given nonempty open set .",

    "we have defined frequent hypercyclicity for linear dynamical systems only , but the notion obviously makes sense for an arbitrary polish dynamical system @xmath5 .",

    "likewise , what could be called hypercyclic systems ( i.e. polish dynamical systems admitting dense orbits ) are of course central objects in topological dynamics . in this paper , we will use the linear terminology ( hypercyclic , frequently hypercyclic ) for both linear dynamical systems and general polish dynamical systems .",
    "one of the interests of frequent hypercyclicity is that , although its definition is purely topological , its is naturally and deeply linked to measure - theoretic considerations about the dynamical system @xmath5 .",
    "this is for instance testified by the following two facts .    -",
    "if @xmath5 is a polish dynamical system and if @xmath0 admits an ergodic measure @xmath15 with full support , then @xmath0 is frequently hypercyclic and @xmath32 has full @xmath33-@xmath21measure .",

    "- if @xmath5 is a _ compact _ dynamical system and if @xmath0 is frequently hypercyclic , then @xmath0 admits an invariant probability  measure with full support .",
    "a proof of this statement can be found in @xcite ; it will also be briefly recalled at the beginning of section 2 .",
    "these observations make it natural to wonder whether an arbitrary frequently hypercyclic polish dynamical system always admits an invariant probability  measure with full support .",
    "that the answer to this question is negative was kindly pointed out to us by b. weiss .",
    "let @xmath34 be any irrational rotation of @xmath35 , and let @xmath15 be the normalized lebesgue measure  on @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 is a uniquely ergodic  dynamical system whose unique invariant probability measure is @xmath15 and for which all points are frequently hypercyclic . let @xmath37 be a nowhere dense compact subset of @xmath35 such that @xmath38 , and set @xmath39",
    ". then @xmath2 is a @xmath40-@xmath21invariant , dense @xmath41 subset of @xmath35 , and hence @xmath42 is a frequently hypercyclic  polish dynamical system .",
    "on the other hand , we have @xmath43 because @xmath44 and @xmath15 is an ergodic measure for @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath34 is uniquely ergodic , it follows that @xmath42 admits no invariant  measure  at all .",
    "this example is however highly non linear , and one may naturally ask what happens in the linear setting .",

    "one may also ask whether a stronger result holds true :    [ q2 ] let @xmath5 be a frequently hypercyclic linear dynamical system .",
    "is it true that @xmath0 admits an _ ergodic _ probability  measure with full support ?",
    "our first main result is concerned with question [ q1 ] .",
    "we obtain a positive answer when @xmath0 is a linear operator acting on a _ reflexive _ banach space @xmath2 .",
    "recall that a measure @xmath15 on @xmath2 is said to be _ continuous _ if @xmath46 for every @xmath47 . denoting by @xmath48 the set of all _ periodic points _ of @xmath0 , it is not hard to see that if @xmath15 is a @xmath49-@xmath21invariant measure such that @xmath50 , then @xmath15 is necessarily continuous .",
    "[ th1 ] if @xmath2 is a reflexive banach space , then any frequently hypercyclic operator @xmath0 on @xmath2 admits a continuous invariant probability  measure @xmath15 with full support .",
    "in fact , one may require that the measure @xmath15 satisfies @xmath51 .    applying the _ ergodic decomposition theorem _",
    "( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath52 , sec .",
    "@xmath53 ) ) , we easily deduce the following result :    if @xmath2 is a reflexive banach space and if @xmath29 is a nonempty open set , then any frequently hypercyclic operator @xmath0 on @xmath2 admits a continuous ergodic probability measure @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath15 be an invariant measure with full support for @xmath0 such that @xmath50 . by the ergodic decomposition theorem ,",
    "one may write @xmath56 where the @xmath57 are ergodic probability measures for @xmath0 and the integral is taken over some probability space @xmath58 .",
    "the meaning of the above formula is that @xmath59 for every borel set @xmath60 . as @xmath15 has full support , we have @xmath61 and hence @xmath62 ; and since @xmath50 we have @xmath63 for @xmath64-@xmath21almost every @xmath65 .",
    "so one can find @xmath66 such that the measure @xmath67 has the required properties .",
    "the existence of an invariant measure with full support in theorem [ th1 ] relies on the following  nonlinear \" statement , which is valid for a rather large class of polish dynamical systems .",
    "[ th2 ] let @xmath5 be a polish dynamical system .",
    "assume that @xmath2 is endowed with a topology @xmath68 which is hausdorff , coarser than the original topology @xmath69 , and such that every point of @xmath2 has a neighbourhood basis with respect to @xmath69 consisting of @xmath70-@xmath21compact sets .",
    "moreover , assume that    * @xmath0 is frequently hypercyclic with respect to @xmath69 ; * @xmath0 is a continuous self - map of @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath0 admits an invariant probability  measure with full support .    forgetting the continuity requirement on @xmath15 , the first part of theorem [ th1 ] follows at once from this result , taking for @xmath68 the weak topology of the reflexive banach space @xmath2 and using the fact that the closed balls of @xmath2 are weakly compact .",
    "since compactness is rather crucial in all our arguments , and although we are not able to provide a counterexample , it seems reasonable to believe that theorem [ th1 ] breaks down when the space @xmath2 is not assumed to be reflexive .",
    "good candidates for counterexamples could be bilateral weighted shifts on @xmath72 in the spirit of those constructed by bayart and rusza in @xcite .",
    "so we restate question [ q1 ] as    [ q4 ] does there exist a frequently hypercyclic operator ( necessarily living on some non - reflexive banach space ) which does not admit any invariant measure with full support ?    regarding question [ q2 ] , we are able to answer it in the negative .",
    "let us first note that this question was already investigated in @xcite , where it was proved that there exists a bounded operator on the sequence space @xmath73 ( actually , a weighted backward shift ) which is frequently hypercyclic but does not admit any ergodic _ gaussian _",
    "measure with full support .",
    "the proof given in @xcite can be easily extended to show that this frequently hypercyclic operator does not admit any ergodic measure @xmath15 with full support such that @xmath74 ; but the existence of a second order moment seems to be crucial in the argument .",
    "our second main results shows that this aditional assumption can be dispensed with .",
    "[ th3 ] there exists a frequently hypercyclic operator on the space @xmath72 which does not admit any ergodic measure with full support .",
    "however , question [ q2 ] remains widely open on all other  classical \" banach spaces , and in particular for hilbert space operators .",
    "in this special case there are several reasons to believe that the answer could be  yes \" , some of which will be outlined in the sequel .",
    "more generally , theorem [ th2 ] makes the following instance of question [ q2 ] especially interesting .",
    "[ q6 ] does any frequently hypercyclic operator @xmath0 acting on a reflexive banach space admit an ergodic probability  measure with full support ?",
    "one of the main ingredients in the proof of theorem [ th3 ] is a certain parameter @xmath75 $ ] associated with any hypercyclic operator @xmath0 acting on a banach space @xmath2 .",
    "very roughly speaking , @xmath76 is the maximal frequency with which the orbit of a hypercyclic vector @xmath8 for @xmath0 can visit a ball centered at @xmath77 . in fact , for any @xmath78 we have @xmath79    the parameter @xmath76 can bear witness of the existence of an ergodic measure with full support . indeed , we can prove    [ th4 ] let @xmath5 be a linear dynamical system . if @xmath0 admits an ergodic measure with full support , then @xmath80 .",

    "the authors ask ( a restricted form of ) the following question .",

    "one of the most tempting roads one could follow in order to find an invariant measure @xmath15 such that @xmath89 is to try to use baire category arguments in the space of @xmath0-@xmath21invariant measures @xmath20 .",
    "this is far from being a new idea .",
    "indeed , this strategy has already proved to be quite successful in a number of nonlinear situations ; see for instance @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
