    "among numerous new ideas and concepts that have been put forward to explain the unusual properties the high temperature superconductors ( hts ) , which go beyond the conventional fermi liquid theory,@xcite the staggered flux ( sf ) phase @xcite attracts much attention as a candidate for the pseudogap normal phase of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "@xcite such a state is characterized by a checkerboard pattern of plaquette currents circulating clockwise and anticlockwise on two different sublattices so that the corresponding flux flowing through each plaquette alternates in sign .    on the one hand , using the su(2 ) gauge invariance of the heisenberg model one can show that at half - filling the sf phase is equivalent to the @xmath2-wave superconducting wave function @xcite which has correctly reproduced several key experimental properties of the hts .",
    "@xcite moreover , its gutzwiller - projected energy is in a very good agreement with the best estimate for the ground - state energy of the two - dimensional undoped heisenberg antiferromagnet.@xcite on the other hand , even though a finite doping removes this degeneracy and stabilizes @xmath2-wave superconductivity in the ground state , @xcite the sf phase is the lowest - energy gutzwiller - projected nonsuperconducting state that has been constructed so far,@xcite and its energy spectrum remains similar to the @xmath2-wave superconductor .",
    "signatures of the sf pattern in the current - current correlation have been seen in the gutzwiller - projected @xmath2-wave superconducting phase @xcite and in the exact ground - state wave - function of the @xmath0@xmath1 model.@xcite it has also been proposed that the hidden @xmath2-density wave ( ddw ) order of the doped sf phase could be the origin of the mysterious pseudogap behavior.@xcite finally , it has been shown that under some circumstances the sf phase can coexist with @xmath2-wave superconductivity in the underdoped regime.@xcite    however , the physics of the hole - doped cuprates seems to be even more involved as the competition between the superexchange interaction which stabilizes the antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order in the parent mott insulator , and the kinetic energy of doped holes , might lead to the formation of stripe phases with hole - rich regions and locally suppressed magnetic order , which was suggested in early hartree - fock studies.@xcite in a stripe phase two neighboring af domains are separated by a one - dimensional domain wall ( dw ) , where a phase shift of @xmath3 occurs in the af order parameter .",
    "later on , experimental confirmation of the stripe phases has triggered a large number of studies devoted to their properties within a number of methods which go beyond the hartree - fock approach.@xcite moreover , even though static charge and spin orders have only been observed in layered cuprates , e.g. , in la@xmath4nd@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( nd - lsco ) ( see ref . ) and la@xmath8ba@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( see ref . ) , while in bilayered yba@xmath9cu@xmath10o@xmath11 ( ybco ) only a stripe - like charge order and incommensurate spin fluctuations have been reported,@xcite stripe phases quickly joined the list of candidates for the pseudogap phase in the cuprates as they are compatible with many experimental results.@xcite    although numerical simulations of microscopic models of correlated fermions , such as the @xmath0@xmath1 model ( see later ) , are especially difficult , various signatures consistent with ( i ) ddw states , and ( ii ) stripe phases have been detected .",
    "in particular , the emergence of strong staggered current correlations under doping the mott insulator has been reported in exact diagonalizations by leung,@xcite and attributed to the formation of spin bipolarons.@xcite these findings are consistent with an early observation of staggered spin chirality@xcite since charge degrees of freedom strongly couple to spin _ scalar _ chirality .",
    "interestingly , spin chirality / charge currents seem to compete with hole pairing,@xcite and this issue requires a further careful consideration . simultaneously with those findings , the observation of stripes and checkerboard patterns ( which also include some form of charge ordering ) has also been confirmed by density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) computations for some boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite    we also note that an exotic sf phase with long - range orbital current order _ at half - filling _ ( in contrast to the fully projected sf phase , see ref . )",
    "was stabilized in various extended hubbard - like models ( which include some form of charge fluctuations not present in the simpler model discussed above ) within ladder @xcite or bilayer @xcite geometries .",
    "it was also shown that such a long - range ddw order could survive with the emergence of stripe - like features under doping.@xcite    unfortunately , even though stripe phases seem to play important role in the physics of hts , it is still not clear how the stripes are connected , as a competing state , to @xmath2-wave superconductivity . therefore , in this paper we introduce a new class of wave functions with composite order in a form of _ filled domain flux _ ( fdf ) phases , with one doped hole per one dw atom .",
    "in addition to capturing essential properties of the sf phases , the fdf structure accounts for the incommensurate _",
    "diagonal _ spin peaks observed in lightly ( @xmath12 ) doped la@xmath8sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( lsco ) @xcite and nd - lsco .",
    "@xcite thus , our phase should allow one to obtain a smooth transition from the insulating state at half - filling to the @xmath2-wave superconductor above a critical doping @xmath13 , with a concomitant change of the dw orientation into _ vertical _ stripes just at @xmath13 , as observed experimentally in lsco.@xcite the existence of such phases is suggested by recent variational monte - carlo calculations which show an instability of the sf states towards phase separation , @xcite and we argue that self - organization into flux domains separated by dws is generic in the doped @xmath0@xmath1 model .",
    "most pronounced features of these phases shown in fig . [ fig : cart](a , b ) are : ( i ) doped holes self - organize into diagonal dws , ( ii ) dws separate weakly doped sf domains with a smoothly modulated magnitude of the flux within them , ( iii ) dws introduce a phase shift of @xmath3 in the flux phase and the sf domains alternate , and finally ( iv ) in contrast to the so - called commensurate flux ( cf ) phases , the total flux vanishes , and therefore no asymmetry of the magnetic response is expected when reversing the direction of an applied magnetic field .",
    "in fact , these fdf phases have strong similarities with the solution obtained in ref .   using uniform ( i.e. , site independent ) gutzwiller factors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model and its treatment in the gutzwiller approximation are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the properties of locally stable domain flux phases with either bond - centered or site - centered domain walls are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : dom ] .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "[ sec : summa ] by pointing out certain possibilities of experimental verification of the suggested type of order and by a short summary of main results .",
    "we consider the @xmath0-@xmath1 model,@xcite @xmath14 which is believed to describe the physics of the hts .",
    "@xcite here the summations include each bond @xmath15 only once .",
    "next , the local constraints that restrict the hopping processes @xmath16 to the subspace with no doubly occupied sites are replaced by statistical gutzwiller weights,@xcite while decoupling in the particle - hole channel yields the following mean field ( mf ) hamiltonian , @xmath17 with the self - consistency conditions for the bond - order parameters @xmath18    = 0.01    ( 100,39 ) ( 10,26 ) ( 10,13 ) ( 10 , 0 ) ( 5,36 ) ( a ) ( 5,23 ) ( b ) ( 5,10 ) ( c )    in principle , simultaneous decoupling in the particle - particle channel is also possible,@xcite but since we are interested in the diagonal dws similar to the ones observed in the underdoped lsco family , @xcite we focus here on nonsuperconducting solutions .",
    "in particular we choose @xmath19 , one of the magic doping fractions at which low - temperature in - plane resistivity of lsco is weakly enhanced suggesting a tendency towards charge order.@xcite here , to allow for small non - uniform charge modulations , the gutzwiller weights have been expressed in terms of local doped hole densities @xmath20 as follows:@xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 . for simplicity , results shown below correspond to nearest neighbor hopping @xmath23 only .",
    "@xcite thanks to developing an efficient reciprocal space scheme by making use of the symmetry,@xcite the calculations were carried out on a large @xmath24 cluster at low temperature @xmath25 , which eliminates the finite size effects .",
    "our starting point is the cf phase , a wave function which , away from half - filling , displays remarkable commensurability effects at special fillings and fulfills the self - consistency condition at @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite indeed , in the limit @xmath27 , the magnetic ( superexchange ) energy in the cf phase exhibits a minimum when the fictitious flux ( in unit of the flux quantum ) , flowing through each plaquette and defined by a sum over the four bonds of the plaquette @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the phase of @xmath30 , follows exactly the filling fraction , i.e. , @xmath31 . in this case ,",
    "hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_mf ] ) reduces to the hofstadter hamiltonian describing the motion of an electron in a uniform magnetic flux assumed to be rational @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the peculiar property of the superexchange energy follows from the cf phase band structure with @xmath33 bands and the fermi level lying in the largest gap above the @xmath34th subband . as a result , the modulus of the bond - order parameter @xmath30 ( [ eq : bond ] ) , the spin correlation and the hole density are all spatially uniform [ see fig . [",
    "fig : cart](c ) ] . however , infinitesimally small @xmath35 selects a special arrangement of the phases @xmath36",
    "so as to optimize the kinetic energy term @xmath37 and should produce an inhomogeneous structure.@xcite    within this class of singlet ( nonmagnetic ) wave functions , competing with possible inhomogeneous solutions ( see later ) , the uniform sf phase also offers a very good compromise between the magnetic ( @xmath38 ) and kinetic ( @xmath39 ) energy . for small @xmath0 and @xmath40 ,",
    "the kinetic energy is minimized ( within the mf approach ) when all phases of @xmath30 are set to a constant @xmath41 , corresponding to alternating fluxes @xmath42 ( sf phase ) .",
    "increasing @xmath35 gradually reduces @xmath43 and drives the system towards a fermi liquid state ( with real @xmath30 ) in a continuous way .",
    "starting with initial parameters corresponding to a uniform cf phase , the self - consistent procedure leads to new fdf solutions which could explain a diagonal spin modulation observed experimentally in the insulating regime of lsco @xcite and nd - lsco,@xcite usually interpreted in terms of diagonal stripes , even though no signatures of any charge modulation were observed yet .",
    "this conjecture is also supported by the recent neutron scattering studies of the ni impurity effect on the diagonal incommensurability in lsco .",
    "@xcite indeed , doping by ni quickly suppresses the incommensurability and restores the nel state .",
    "this indicates a strong effect on hole localization and thus favors the presence of charge stripes with mobile holes rather than the spiral order with localized hole spins .",
    "interestingly , we found two types of topologically different but nearly degenerate solutions which both have the same size of the unit cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cart ] ) : ( i ) a _ bond - centered _ fdf phase , very similar to the original cf one , where each dw is characterized by a _",
    "zero current _ staircase and by a maximum of the hole density spread over the related bonds [ fig .",
    "[ fig : cart](a ) ] , as well as ( ii ) a _ site - centered _ fdf phase , where the dws are characterized by _",
    "zero flux _",
    "plaquettes ordered along a diagonal line and by a maximum of the hole density centered at two of their corner sites [ fig .",
    "[ fig : cart](b ) ] .",
    "apart from local doped hole densities @xmath44 , bond quantities are needed for a full characterization of both phases ( here we use a short - hand notation ) : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 with a phase factor @xmath49 compensating the modulation of the flux within a single domain of the sf phase .",
    "typical profiles of the above defined observables at low doping are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfp1 ] .",
    "( [ eq : ni ] ) , ( b , f ) spin correlation @xmath50 ( [ eq : s ] ) , ( c , g ) bond charge @xmath51 ( [ eq : t ] ) , and ( d , h ) modulated flux @xmath52 ( [ eq : phi ] ) in the _ bond - centered _ ( left ) and _ site - centered _ ( right ) fdf phases at @xmath19 for : @xmath53 ( triangles ) , and @xmath54 ( squares ) . for comparison ,",
    "circles depict the related @xmath55 solutions : the cf phase with uniform fictitious flux @xmath56 ( left ) and a two - domain @xmath57 sf phase ( right).,width=309 ]    the stability of the fdf phases originates from a subtle competition between the magnetic @xmath38 and kinetic energies @xmath39 .",
    "let us first focus on the @xmath55 limit where the _ site - centered _ sf phase is stable and very competitive ( among the nonmagnetic states ) , in contrast to the _ bond - centered _ one .",
    "this extreme case corresponds to the localization of doped holes at dws and the superexchange energy in the sf domains is best optimized .",
    "indeed , by expelling holes from the sf domains one reinforces locally the af correlations with a concomitant reduction of both bond charge and current correlations . on the contrary , due to a large hole density ,",
    "both these tendencies are reversed around the dws . however",
    ", increasing @xmath58 leads to a much broader charge spatial distribution in the unit cell as a larger fraction of holes enters the sf domains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dfp1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , both fdf phases remain competitive even in the regime of large ( realistic ) values of @xmath59 due to : ( i ) enhanced short - range af correlations deep in the sf domains ( @xmath60 compared to @xmath61 in the uniform phase ) , where the fictitious flux approaches the special value @xmath62 ( local minimum of the kinetic energy in the limit @xmath63 ) , and ( ii ) strongly enhanced bond charge accumulated around the dws , typically three times larger than that in the sf phase , due to both amplification of the @xmath64 factors and reduced ( vanishing ) fictitious flux flowing through the bond - centered ( site - centered ) plaquettes at the dws .    of particular interest",
    "is whether one can also stabilize within the present formalism the so - called half - filled domain flux ( hdf ) phases , analogous to _ half - filled _ stripes with one hole per two atoms in a dw as observed in the cuprates around @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite on the one hand , both self - consistent _ bond- _ and _ site - centered _ hdf phases found at @xmath19 and @xmath54 have a somewhat higher total energy per site ( @xmath66 ) than those obtained for both degenerate fdf ones ( @xmath67 ) , and for the uniform sf phase ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "however , table  [ tab:1_8 ] shows that all domain flux phases become very competitive at @xmath65 , not only with respect to the sf phase but also with respect to a recently proposed nonuniform @xmath69 superstructure .",
    "@xcite note also that while the fdf phases optimize mainly @xmath38 , the hdf ones are characterized by rather low @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we predict that large @xmath58 rather favors the domain flux phases with partially filled dws .",
    "we argue that quantum fluctuations are likely to stabilize them , in analogy to the half - filled stripe phases,@xcite or to the fully projected @xmath69 checkerboard wave function which was recently shown to be more stable than the uniform sf phase.@xcite this suggests that other inhomogeneous solutions might be stable as well .",
    "unfortunately , a direct comparison of our singlet wave functions to the original ( magnetic ) stripe phases@xcite is not possible yet since both are described within two entirely different formalisms . hence further studies using more sophisticated methods ( like projected wave functions as in ref .  ) are needed .",

    "@xcite both features are qualitatively reproduced in the fdf phases  the electronic bands are almost dispersionless along the @xmath74 direction , and a gap opens at @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bs ] ) , indicating that transport across the dws is suppressed . however , the most salient feature of the electronic structure in fdf phases is a relativistic cone - like dispersion around the @xmath81 point .",
    "indeed , massless dirac excitations are at the heart of the quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions ( qed@xmath82 ) theory of pseudogap in the cuprates.@xcite this feature is also found in the sf phase , but for the uniform flux and hole distribution it occurs away from the fermi energy @xmath75 .",
    "the shape of the electronic structure in the fdf phase depends on the actual value of @xmath58 .",
    "firstly , a strong localization of holes at dws in the limit @xmath55 pushes the top of the lower band cone well below @xmath75 . secondly ,",
    "finite @xmath0 weakens the stripe order so that the gap between the lower and upper band at the @xmath83 point is reduced .",
    "a further increase of @xmath0 pushes some lower band states above @xmath75 enabling transport along the dws .",
    "for possible experimental verification of the present proposal it is important to realize that orbital currents of the domain flux phase give rise to weak magnetic fields ( that should be experimentally distinguishable from the copper spins ) .",
    "muon spin rotation ( @xmath75sr ) technique is an extremely sensitive local probe especially suited to study small modulations of local fields .",
    "earlier estimations @xcite give 10 to 100 gauss corresponding roughly to 0.03 to 0.25 @xmath84 in cuprates .",
    "in fact , incommensurate order in the lsco family seen in neutron scattering measurements,@xcite ( with a large but finite correlation length ) might be attributed , at least partly , to the existence of orbital moments .",
    "finally , note that although the phases considered here do not break su(2 ) symmetry and do not exhibit af long range order , on general principle they can still sustain af correlations on large distances ( i.e. , beyond nearest neighbor sites ) between copper spins .    in summary , we have introduced and investigated a new class of flux phases that unify the remarkable properties of the sf uniform phase with the incommensurate magnetic correlations established in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "bond- and site - centered fdf phases are nearly degenerate which indicates strong fluctuations which are expected to be amplified , either for increasing @xmath58 or for increasing doping @xmath40 . as these phases are only marginally unstable at the mf level",
    ", they might be stabilized by quantum effects and explain the low temperature physics of the cuprates in the low doping regime , where a pseudogap phase forms at higher temperature .",
    "therefore , the solutions presented here could be viewed as a low - temperature instability of the nearby ddw pseudogap phase ( stable at higher temperature but below @xmath85 ) in the same way as the `` ordinary '' stripe phases could be seen as an instability of the nearby doped af nel state at infinitesimal @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , our proposal calls for a search of experimental signatures of domain flux phases in the underdoped cuprates , especially in the lsco family .",
