    "the importance of infrared ( ir ) bright galaxies has been recognized since their discovery more than 30 years ago ( rieke & low 1972 ) and the detection of large numbers by the _ iras _ satellite ( soifer et al . 1987 ) .",
    "specifically , there has been controversy over the extent to which luminous and ultraluminous ir galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath9 = 10^{11}-10^{12}\\,{\\rm l}_\\odot$ ] , and ulirgs @xmath10 , respectively ) in the local universe are powered by intense star formation as opposed to active galactic nuclei ( see the review by sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "the process of merging with accompanying super - starbursts that produces lirgs and ulirgs appears to be an important stage in galaxy evolution , possibly even converting spiral galaxies into ellipticals ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "2001 ; colina et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) and giving rise to quasars ( sanders et al . 1988 ) .    in recent years with the advent of the new generation of ir satellites ,",
    "there has been a considerable effort in understanding the properties of distant ir - selected galaxies .",
    "the majority of these galaxies at @xmath11 are in the lirg class , and they make a significant contribution to the star formation rate density at @xmath12 ( elbaz et al .",
    "2002 ; prez - gonzlez et al . 2005 ; le floch et al . 2005 ) . at @xmath13",
    "a significant fraction of the lirg population appears to be morphologically disturbed spiral galaxies ( bell et al .",
    "2005 ; shi et al .",
    "2006 ) , rather than interacting and merging systems . these high-@xmath14",
    "ir bright galaxies show morphologies and properties ( see e.g. , zheng et al .",
    "2004 ; papovich et al . 2005 ; melbourne , koo , & le floch 2005 ; shi et al . 2006 ) typical of low-@xmath14 lirgs and ulirgs ( among others , murphy et al . 1996 ; surace , sanders , & evans 2000 , scoville et al .",

    "lagache , puget , & dole ( 2005 ) have recently reviewed the properties of the high-@xmath14 ir galaxy population .",
    "the local density of lirgs is two orders of magnitude higher than that of ulirgs ( e.g. , soifer et al .",
    ". moreover , murphy et al . (",
    "2001 ) have argued that in the local universe interacting galaxies may spend a significant fraction of their lifetime as lirgs , whereas the ulirg phase may just be short and recurrent during the merging process .",
    "however , the majority of the detailed studies of the local universe ir galaxies have been focused on the objects with the largest ir luminosities ( i.e. , ulirgs ) .",
    "the lirgs have been generally neglected , except for detailed studies of a few famous examples ( e.g. , gehrz , sramek , & weedman 1983 ; doyon , joseph , & wright 1994 ; genzel et al .",

    "; sugai et al . 1999 ; lpari et al . 2000 , 2004 ; alonso - herrero et al . 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "thus , understanding low-@xmath14 lirg samples is critical for interpreting the properties of ir - selected high-@xmath14 galaxy populations ; in addition , they represent the link between ulirgs and the population of field galaxies as a whole .",

    "the field of view ( fov ) of the images is approximately @xmath32 which for our sample covers the central @xmath33kpc of the galaxies .",
    "the observations were designed such that each galaxy could be observed within one _ hst _ orbit .",
    "the typical integration times were 250s for each of the broad - band filters and @xmath34s for each of the narrow - band filters .",
    "for each filter the total integration time was split into three individual exposures with relative offsets of 5 pixels .",
    "the images were reduced using the _ hst_/nicmos pipeline routines , which involve subtraction of the first readout , dark current subtraction on a readout - by - readout basis , correction for linearity and cosmic ray rejection , and flat fielding . for a given filter , the individual images were aligned using common features present in all three images and combined to construct a mosaic .",
    "the final f110w images , continuum - subtracted pa@xmath0 images , and @xmath35 color maps are presented in fig .  1 for the new observations of galaxies in our sample .",
    "the flux calibration of the images was performed using conversion factors given in the _ hst_/nicmos handbook .",
    "we have also examined the near - ir continuum images and the @xmath36 color maps ( fig .  1 ) to look for the presence of nuclear point sources .",
    "when a nuclear point source was detected we obtained photometry with a 1-diameter aperture ( subtracting the underlying galaxy emission measured in an annulus around the point source ) and performed an aperture correction ( from the nicmos handbook ) to include all the flux from the point source . the typical photometry uncertainties associated with removing the underlying galaxy emission were @xmath37mag . if a nuclear point source was not detected , we measured the continuum emission using a similarly sized aperture but without removing the emission from the underlying galaxy .",
    "the results for the nuclei are presented in table  2 , and discussed in  4.2 .",
    "the continuum - subtracted pa@xmath0 line emission images were produced by subtracting the f187n images from the f190n images , both calibrated in jy . using the f190n filter we estimate that for galaxies at @xmath38 up to 20% ( for the typical widths of hydrogen recombination lines of lirgs not containing a type 1 agn , see goldader et al .",
    "1997a ) of the pa@xmath0 flux could be lost due to the observed wavelength of the emission line ( see discussion in alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we have used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to analyze the properties of the individual hii regions detected in the pa@xmath0 images of our sample of galaxies .",
    "we have set the lower limit for the size of an hii region to 9 contiguous pixels .",
    "for the distances of the galaxies in our sample , this corresponds to minimum linear sizes ( equivalent diameters ) of between 44 and 96pc .",
    "the detection threshold criterion for a pixel to be included as part of an hii region is to be above the background plus twice the rms noise of the background .",
    "sextractor constructs a background image by a bi - cubic interpolation over areas of the background with a size specified by the user .",
    "these areas ought to be larger than the typical size of an hii region , but not so large as to smooth over local variations of the background .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in measuring the pa@xmath0 fluxes of the hii regions is the background removal .",
    "after modelling the background and hii regions , we output their positions , and isophotal fluxes , errors , and areas after subtracting the global background from the observed pa@xmath0 flux .    the properties of the hii regions detected in the lirgs are summarized in table  3 .",
    "we list the h@xmath0 luminosity ( the pa@xmath0/h@xmath0 ratio varies by about 10% for various conditions and under case b ; we take a ratio of 8.6 from hummer & storey 1987 ) for the median hii region , the brightest hii region , and the average h@xmath0 luminosity of the three brightest hii regions ( first - ranked hii regions ) , as well as the ratio of the sum of the luminosities of the three brightest hii regions to the observed h@xmath0 luminosity in hii regions , and the observed h@xmath0 luminosity in hii regions .",
    "these properties are discussed in  6 .",
    "morphological studies of complete samples of local ulirgs have found that the great majority appear to be merging and/or disturbed systems ( e.g. , murphy et al . 1996 ; clements et al .",

    "the most common continuum features in our sample are luminous star clusters and large - scale spiral arms .",

    "the average photometric extinctions over the pa@xmath0 emitting regions for our sample of galaxies are given in the second column of table  6 .",
    "a comparison with the spectroscopic extinctions in tables  4 and 5 shows that the photometric extinctions are comparable to or slightly smaller than the extinctions to the gas for the galaxies in common .",
    "however , in most cases , the photometric extinctions are derived for larger areas than the regions covered by the spectroscopic observations .",
    "since there is evidence in spiral galaxies that the extinction tends to decrease with distance from the galaxy center ( calzetti et al . 2005 ) , the average photometric extinction measured over larger regions will tend to be smaller than the spectroscopic values .",
    "we also find that the highest values of the average photometric extinction over the pa@xmath0 emitting regions tend occur in those galaxies with the most compact ( @xmath179kpc ) pa@xmath0 emitting regions ( e.g. , mcg  + 12 - 02 - 001 ) or in the edge - on systems ( e.g. , ngc  2369 , ugc  3351 ) .",
    "as we saw in  5 about half of the galaxies in our sample show extended pa@xmath0 emission covering the entire fov of the nicmos observations . before we compare the pa@xmath0 ( or h@xmath0 ) and ir luminosities , we need to assess the importance of the hii region and diffuse emission at large galactocentric distances , especially for the nearest examples in our sample .",
    "hattori et al . ( 2004 ) for their sample of @xmath180 m flux - limited lirgs , which includes some of the galaxies in our sample , have found that the star formation activity is dominated by emission extending over several kpc .",
    "we have obtained the h@xmath0 images from hattori et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the galaxies in common with our work , and measured the h@xmath0 fluxes within the nicmos fov and the total extent of the galaxy .",
    "as can be seen from table  7 , the contribution from the large - scale h@xmath0 emission can be as high as 50% in some galaxies .",
    "we have eight further galaxies in common with the sample of dopita et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . from inspection of their h@xmath0 images , which comprise the entire systems",
    ", we infer that the nicmos pa@xmath0 images include most of the emission of ngc  633 , mcg@xmath1502 - 33 - 098e / w , ic  4518e / w , ngc  5734 , and ic  4686/ic  4687 .",
    "the h@xmath0 images of ic  4734 , and ngc  7130 ( dopita et al . 2002 ) , as well as of ic  5179 ( see lehnert & heckman 1995 ) and ngc  6701 ( see mrquez , moles , & masegosa 1996 ) show hii region and diffuse h@xmath0 emission over scales larger than the fov of the pa@xmath0 images , and thus our extinction - corrected pa@xmath0 luminosities are lower limits to the total emission .",
    "if the average extinction of hii regions decreases for increasing galactocentric distances ( calzetti et al .",
    "2005 ) , as in spiral galaxies , the contributions from the large - scale component not covered by the nicmos images derived from the h@xmath0 images will be upper limits .    we have retrieved the available mips @xmath8 m images from the _ spitzer _ archive and simulated the nicmos fov to estimate the contribution from the large - scale emission . at @xmath8 m the nicmos fov ( @xmath181 ) covers most of the emission ( @xmath182 ) for the majority of the galaxies of the sample , except for those listed in table  7 . for those galaxies with available h@xmath0 imaging ,",
    "the agreement on the fraction of extended emission derived from the @xmath8 m imaging is reasonably good .",
    "we conclude that , with a few exceptions , the pa@xmath0 detected by nicmos is representative of the totals for our sample of galaxies .",
    "both the ir emission and @xmath183 are good tracers of the massive sfr in galaxies .",
    "@xmath183 is usually derived from hydrogen recombination lines , and has the advantage that it traces the current massive sfr , almost independently of the previous star formation history of the galaxy ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the main disadvantage in deriving sfrs from @xmath183 is determining @xmath175 and the fraction of escaping photons from hii regions .",
    "the former problem can be alleviated by using near - ir , mid - ir , and radio recombination lines ( e.g. , h92@xmath0 , see zhao et al . 1997 ; roy et al .",
    "the issue of the fraction of escaping photons is still uncertain and is not considered here , but it has been addressed both observationally ( beckman et al .",
    "2000 ) and theoretically ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 ) .",
    "the ir luminosity of a starburst galaxy is due to uv emission ( produced mainly by the young stellar population ) absorbed by dust and re - emitted in the thermal ir . as discussed by kennicutt ( 1998 ) , the efficacy of the ir luminosity as a tracer of the sfr depends on the contribution of the young stars to the heating of the dust , and requires that all the uv light from massive stars be absorbed by the dust ( i.e. , @xmath184mag , see also calzetti et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the presence of high dust opacities , as in lirgs",
    ", the ir luminosity dominates the bolometric luminosity of the system and is the ultimate tracer of the sfr , but with a somewhat ill - determined time scale .",
    "the mid - ir luminosities are routinely used to estimate the total ir luminosities and sfrs of galaxies at cosmological distances ( e.g. , elbaz et al .",

    "when they could not obtain _ iras _ fluxes for the individual components of close interacting systems , the @xmath28 m and ir luminosities of each component were assumed to have a ratio similar to that of their pa@xmath0 luminosities .",
    "in addition to our sample of lirgs , we have compiled a small comparison sample of normal galaxies with available nicmos pa@xmath0 imaging observations ( not corrected for extinction ) from bker et al .",
    "the normal galaxies were chosen so that the nicmos pa@xmath0 observations covered the majority of the ionized hydrogen emission . if the values of the extinction inferred from h@xmath0/pa@xmath0 line ratios for a few spiral galaxies and star - forming galaxies ( @xmath186mag , see e.g. , maoz et al .",
    "2001 ; quillen & yukita 2001 ; calzetti et al . 2005 ) are representative of our sample of normal galaxies , the extinction correction for the pa@xmath0 luminosity would only be up to @xmath187dex . finally to extend the luminosity range we have included in this comparison the four ulirgs imaged in pa@xmath0 by murphy et al .",
    "for the ulirgs the pa@xmath0 luminosities have been corrected for extinction using the @xmath175 values these authors derived from the h@xmath0/pa@xmath0 line ratios .",
    "there is a tight correlation between both the ir and @xmath28 m , and the extinction - corrected pa@xmath0 luminosities , although some of the galaxies with deviating ir luminosities ( marked in the figures ) , seem to follow better the correlation when the @xmath28 m luminosity is used . for reference",
    "we give in the last column of table  6 the ratio between the sfrs derived from the ir luminosity and the extinction - corrected pa@xmath0 luminosity using the prescriptions of kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",

    "this behavior is consistent with the tendency for the measured ir luminosity to include some contribution from older stars ( see below ) .",

    "in addition we use _ spitzer_/mips @xmath8 m observations of resolved star - forming regions within the central 6kpc region of m51 from calzetti et al .",

    "2006 for more details ) to pa@xmath0 assuming case b recombination .",
    "the inclusion of data for resolved star - forming regions within m51 and m81 allows us to extend the range of the mid - ir - pa@xmath0 relation down three orders of magnitude .    as can be seen from fig .  4 ( left panel ) , the lirgs , ulirgs , and normal galaxies seem to continue the relation between the extinction - corrected pa@xmath0 luminosity and the @xmath8 m luminosity observed for the m51 central hii knots .",
    "we also show in this figure data for galaxies from the universidad complutense de madrid sample ( ucm , prez - gonzlez et al . 2003 ) and the nearby field galaxy sample ( nfgs , kewley et al .",
    "2002 ) with available h@xmath0 imaging , and extinction corrections derived from the balmer decrement .",
    "these galaxies also follow the trend but with a larger scatter , as their measurements are from h@xmath0 imaging rather than pa@xmath0 .",
    "the m81 hii regions , on the other hand , follow a similar linear relation , but the relation appears to be offset with respect to that of m51 , normal galaxies , and lirgs ( see discussion by prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "this behavior could arise from a lower uv absorption efficiency in the relatively low luminosity and lightly obscured hii regions in m81 .",
    "the best fit to the extinction - corrected pa@xmath0 vs. @xmath8 m luminosity relation for resolved star - forming regions of m51 , normal galaxies ( with available pa@xmath0 imaging ) , lirgs ( excluding ic  860 ) , and ulirgs is :    @xmath192    where the luminosities are in erg s@xmath19 , and the @xmath8 m luminosity is computed as the monochromatic value , i.e. , from @xmath193 . for comparison the fit to the m51 hii regions alone",
    "gives a slightly smaller slope ( @xmath194 , see also calzetti et al .",
    "2005 ) , but within the errors of the fit including normal galaxies , lirgs , and ulirgs .",
    "the fit to the m81 hii regions alone provides a similar slope , essentially equal to unity ( @xmath195 ) .    as also noted by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) there are variations in the mid - ir to pa@xmath0 ratios from galaxy to galaxy , clearly shown in fig .  4 ( right panel ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath196 ratios of the m81 hii regions appear to follow a different trend in terms of the pa@xmath0 luminosity than the rest of galaxies and the m51 hii regions .",
    "( prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2006 attribute the large scatter of @xmath196 in m81 to uncertain extinction corrections ) .",
    "the variation of the @xmath196 ratio with the pa@xmath0 luminosity ( i.e. , sfr ) between the m51 hii knots and our lirgs and ulirgs is similar to the @xmath197/sfr ratios found by calzetti et al .",
    "in fact , the gap between the m51 hii knots and the lirgs / ulirgs seen in our figure is occupied by their uv - selected sample of starbursts , and the ucm and nfgs galaxies .",
    "we note however that we find a more pronounced variation of the @xmath196 ratio because we use the pa@xmath0 luminosity as a proxy for the sfr for lirgs , whereas they use the ir luminosity ( see previous section , and table  6 ) .",
    "the deviation from strict proportionality in the @xmath198 vs. @xmath199 relation in dusty systems probably results from the effects of extinction . lirgs and ulirgs",
    "are known to contain highly obscured regions , usually associated with the nuclei of the galaxies , that are optically thick in the optical , and even in the near- and mid - ir ( e.g , genzel et al .",
    "1995 ; 1998 ; alonso - herrero et al . 2000",
    "; doyon et al . 1994 ; kotilainen et al . 1996 ; zhou et al . 1993 ) .",
    "there is also indirect evidence based on the observed ratios of mid - ir fine - structure emission lines that many of the youngest stars in massive starbursts may still be embedded in ultra - compact high density hii regions ( rigby & rieke 2004 ) and thus hidden from us by large amounts of extinction .",
    "the departures from a constant @xmath200 ratio may be linked to differences in the physical conditions in regions experiencing intense star formation . in particular , the average extinction for the hii regions in m81 is @xmath201mag ( prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2006 ) , whereas for the hii knots of m51 is @xmath202mag ( calzetti et al .",
    "2005 ) , and for our sample of lirgs the average extinctions over the pa@xmath0 emitting regions are @xmath203mag .",
    "since the estimated extinctions for the m51 hii regions and lirgs are not too different , it is possible that we are underestimating the extinction in our sample of lirgs . as shown for arp  299 by alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and ngc  7469 by genzel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the @xmath204 continuum colors tend to underestimate the extinction in very dusty systems .",
    "thus , it is possible that the photometric extinctions derived for some of the galaxies in our sample are only lower limits to the true extinction ( e.g. , compare the photometric and spectroscopic extinctions to the central regions of iras  17138@xmath151017 and ngc  2388 ) .",
    "particularly , this may be the case for the pa@xmath0 emission in highly inclined dusty galaxies ( those described in  5.5 ) .",
    "we note also that not all of the most luminous ir systems in our sample are dominated by such extincted sources , for instance , the star formation properties of the merger ngc  1614 can be explained with @xmath205mag ( see alonso - herrero et al .",
    "fortunately , the relative insensitivity of pa@xmath0 to extinction makes these differences relatively unimportant in estimating the sfr , or the scatter in fig .",
    "4 would be much larger than it is .",
    "the high extinction indicated for the lirgs , the possibility that the extinction is actually higher than our estimates , and the likelihood that some of the youngest stars are still embedded in ultracompact hii regions are all consistent with our finding of a slope to the @xmath206 vs. @xmath199 relation significantly larger than unity .",
    "we believe that the physical explanation for this behavior is that the dust competes increasingly effectively for ionizing photons and ultraviolet continuum photons in very heavily obscured systems , so that there is a trend for an increasing fraction of the luminosity to emerge in the ir . a surprising result",
    ", however , is that this trend is so similar from galaxy to galaxy . for reasonably dust",
    "embedded galaxies and hii regions , there is a linear empirical relationship between ir and hydrogen recombination luminosity with very small scatter that holds over more than four decades in luminosity .      the presence of a bright agn could make a significant contribution to the mid - ir luminosity of the system .",
    "approximately 25% of the galaxies are classified as agn ( seyfert or liner ) on the basis of optical line ratios ( see table  1 ) .",
    "three additional lirgs ( eso  320-g030 , ic  860 , and zw  049.057 ) present megamaser emission ( norris et al . 1986 ; baan , haschick , & uglesich 1993 ) . in extragalactic sources megamaser emission",
    "is generally associated with a strong compact radio continuum source , and about 70% of megamaser sources are classified as agn or composite sources from optical spectroscopy ( baan et al .",
    "1998 ) , or tend to appear in galaxies with warmer _ iras _ colors ( baan et al . 1993 ) . including the galaxies with megamaser emission the fraction of agn in our sample is consistent with that derived by other works ( e.g. , veilleux et al . 1995 ; tran et al . 2001 ) for the same ir luminosity range .    for ngc  7469 genzel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimated that the nucleus contributes up to 40% of _ iras _ ir luminosity ( see also soifer et al .",
    "2003 ) . for the b1 nucleus ( that classified as a seyfert ) of ngc  3690 keto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimated a contribution of @xmath207 in the mid - ir .",
    "for the rest of the galaxies in our sample containing an agn , only in the case of ic  4518w we find that the seyfert nucleus dominates the observed mid - ir emission ( see alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 in preparation ) .",
    "kewley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have argued , based on the radio properties of a sample of warm ir galaxies with ir luminosities similar to our sample , that in the cases where an agn is detected spectroscopically , it is rarely the dominant power source for the ir luminosity . in most cases in the galaxies in our sample containing an agn",
    "there is extended hii emission over large scales ( e.g. , ngc  7130 ; ngc  3690 ) , so it is likely that the agn contribution to the total ir luminosity of the system is significantly smaller than in the case of ngc  7469 and ic  4518w .",
    "we can use the relation in equation ( 1 ) for empirical estimates of the sfr in dusty environments .",
    "the most direct application is to calculate the intrinsic extinction - corrected pa@xmath0 luminosity from the monochromatic luminosity at @xmath8 m .",
    "inverting equation ( 1 ) , we find :    @xmath208    kennicutt ( 1998 ) derived a relationship between h@xmath0 luminosity and the sfr .",
    "he also converted this expression to one between total ir luminosity and sfr in dusty galaxies , and this latter expression has been used widely to interpret ir observations .",
    "we will now update the expression based on the results reported in this paper .",
    "first , we use monochromatic @xmath8 m luminosities in place of total ir luminosities .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) assumed that the great majority of the luminosity from young stars would be absorbed by dust and reradiated in the far - ir in deriving his relationship .",
    "although this assumption is likely to be correct , observationally there may be other contributions to the total ir luminosity from older populations of stars or other luminosity sources ( e.g. , review by tuffs & popescu 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , a true total ir luminosity measurement may overestimate the recent star formation in a galaxy , although estimates based on _ iras _ measurements alone are less subject to these issues because they only poorly sample the output of the cold dust ( because the longest band is at 100@xmath185 m ) .",
    "second , kennicutt assumed a direct proportionality between the h@xmath0 luminosity and the total ir .",
    "we find empirically that the increasing absorption efficiency in increasingly luminous and obscured galaxies leads to a deviation from strict proportionality toward increasing ir output with increasing star - forming luminosity .",
    "we begin by calibrating the mid - ir / pa@xmath0 relation using the hii regions in m51 .",
    "the extinction to these regions is roughly 2 magnitudes at h@xmath0 .",
    "since the morphologies are similar between h@xmath0 and pa@xmath0 ( quillen & yukita 2001 ) , a straightforward extinction correction is appropriate ( e.g. , there are minimal issues with very heavily obscured regions that contribute no h@xmath0 ) . assuming case b recombination , the relation between sfr and h@xmath0 quoted by kennicutt ( 1998 ) can be converted to sfr(m@xmath64 yr@xmath19 ) = @xmath209 ( erg s@xmath19 ) . from these considerations ,",
    "we derive the following relation between the sfr rate and mid - ir luminosity for luminous , dusty galaxies is :    @xmath210    this relation is analogous to the widely used relation between sfr and ir luminosity ( kennicutt 1998 ) but it is not affected by the uncertain contribution to the total ir luminosity of a galaxy of dust heating from old stars .",

    "the nicmos observations cover the central @xmath118kpc of the galaxies .",
    "we find the following :    1 .",
    "the most common morphological continuum features in the central regions are bright star clusters , and large - scale spiral arms , sometimes extending down to the inner kpc ( mini - spirals ) . in highly inclined systems",
    "there are dust lanes crossing the disks of the galaxies and in some cases , even hiding the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "the `` extreme '' ( perturbed ) morphologies commonly seen in ulirgs are only observed in some of the most ir luminous examples in our sample .",
    "approximately half of the lirgs show compact ( @xmath213kpc ) pa@xmath0 morphologies in the form of nuclear star formation rings , mini - spiral structure , and emission associated with the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "the typical observed ( not corrected for extinction ) h@xmath0 surface brightnesses are between @xmath214 kpc@xmath76 , although the most extreme cases , for instance the ring of star formation of ngc  1614 , can reach @xmath82 kpc@xmath76 .",
    "the remaining half of the galaxies show pa@xmath0 emission extending over scales of @xmath118kpc and larger , with bright hii regions in the spiral arms ( face - on systems ) or along the disks of the galaxies ( edge - on systems ) , with or without bright nuclear emission .",
    "the h@xmath0 surface brightnesses are about one order of magnitude fainter than in galaxies with compact pa@xmath0 emission .",
    "most of the lirgs show a population of numerous bright hii regions , and in about half of them the typical hii region ( the median h@xmath0 luminosity ) is as bright as or brighter than the giant hii region 30 dor .",
    "the most ir ( as well as in h@xmath0 ) luminous galaxies tend to host the brightest median and first - ranked hii regions .",
    "the extinctions to the gas ( derived from the h@xmath0/pa@xmath0 and pa@xmath0/br@xmath174 line ratios ) and to the stars ( derived from the @xmath36 colors ) are on average @xmath215mag over the pa@xmath0 emitting regions covered by the",

    "<S> contains hii regions with h@xmath0 luminosities significantly higher than those observed in normal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> there is a linear empirical relationship between the mid - ir @xmath8 m and hydrogen recombination ( extinction - corrected pa@xmath0 ) luminosity for these lirgs , and the hii regions in the central part of m51 . </S>",
    "<S> this relation holds over more than four decades in luminosity suggesting that the mid - ir emission is a good tracer of the star formation rate ( sfr ) . </S>",
    "<S> analogous to the widely used relation between the sfr and total ir luminosity of kennicutt ( 1998 ) , we derive an empirical calibration of the sfr in terms of the monochromatic @xmath8 m luminosity that can be used for luminous , dusty galaxies . </S>"
