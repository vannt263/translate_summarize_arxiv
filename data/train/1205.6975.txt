    "as light carries momentum besides energy , its propagation through a polarizable medium is accompanied by forces .",
    "although the momentum of a single light quantum is very small , laser light can generate appreciable forces on the microscopic scale .",
    "optical forces are nowadays routinely used to manipulate and trap particles ranging from single atoms and molecules  @xcite to plastic beads , biological cells or microbes up to the size of tens of micrometres  @xcite .",
    "the mechanical motion of even larger objects such as silica mircodisks or suspended mirrors has been damped and cooled by light forces  @xcite .",
    "while most of the existing work targets the overall effect on the centre of mass of the particles , it has been shown by us as well as by other groups that these forces do not act homogeneously but exhibit distinct patterns within the medium  @xcite .",
    "for any elastic medium this leads to local compression or stretching .",
    "of course the modified density also changes the local refractive index and light propagation , which again alters the forces as displayed schematically in figure  [ fig:_inhom_concept ] .",
    "the resulting coupled complex evolution thus obviously requires self - consistent models and solutions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , as the light mediated interaction is inherently long range , even a small but periodic variation of the refractive index can have a very large overall collective effect coupling distant areas over a large volume .",
    "this work is organised as follows : in section  [ sec:_inhom_felder ] we first present the basic scattering approach to treat the light propagation in an inhomogeneous refractive medium and use a previously developed formalism based on the free space maxwell stress tensor to calculate the corresponding local force distribution ( section  [ sec:_inhom_kraftdichte ] ) .",
    "this method is then used in section  [ sec:_gleichgewicht_licht_elast ] to develop an iterative scheme to calculate the steady state density and field distribution as a function of geometry and field intensity . in section  [ sec:_numerische_ergebnisse ]",
    "we discuss essential physical consequences predicted by our model at the hand of numerical examples .",
    "finally in section  [ sec:_photon_momentum ] these results are set against common calculations of the total deformation at hand of the change of photon momentum at an interface between to dielectrics .",
    "the effective light propagation in a medium can be seen as the result of multiple individual scattering processes , which in general requires intricate numerical treatments , if one can not make use of material symmetries . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simple but still nontrivial case of two incoming counterpropagating plane waves in a transversely homogeneous and linearly polarizable medium . in this limit only forward and backward scattering add up phase coherently , while all amplitudes for transverse scattering average out . from the viewpoint of the forward and backward propagation directions , transverse scattering",
    "thus can just be added to an effective absorption rate in the medium .",
    "this is certainly not perfectly fulfilled in an actual setup , but still can be expected to give the correct qualitative behaviour , as long as the transverse extensions are much larger than the wavelength of the light .",
    "a more realistic treatment , e.g.  in terms of gaussian transverse beams , is possible , but greatly complicates the model and would obscure many interesting physical phenomena found in this simple approach .",
    "restricting the dynamics to the forward and backward scattering amplitudes along the propagation directions gives a simple and tractable model for our medium via a one dimensional array of @xmath0 thin slices at positions @xmath1 . here the spatial behaviour of the electric field @xmath2\\mathbf{e}_y$ ] is determined by a 1d helmholtz equation  @xcite @xmath3 the field - induced polarisation density at each slice then is @xmath4 , where we introduced the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath5 proportional to the atomic polarizability @xmath6 and the areal particle density @xmath7 within the slice .",
    "@xmath8 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath9 the wave number of the optical field .",
    "note that we assumed here that the dipoles in each slice can simply be added up coherently for scattering along the propagation direction .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig:_schem_illustration_of_deformation ] , the equation above is satisfied by interconnected plane wave solutions  @xcite , here denoted as   @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "the amplitudes left and right of a material slice ( beam splitter ) at position @xmath12 are connected via @xmath13 the amplitudes @xmath14 and @xmath15 are coupled by a simple propagation matrix , i.e.  @xmath16 with @xmath17 , with the distance @xmath18 , @xmath19 .    therefore , the amplitudes to the left of the @xmath20 slice are obtained by a simple multiplication of the previous transfer matrices , @xmath21 the amplitudes @xmath22 and @xmath23 are determined by the amplitudes and phases of waves coming in from the left ( i.e.  @xmath24 ) and from the right ( @xmath25 ) , respectively , and constitute boundary conditions on the solutions for the helmholtz equation  . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are obtained by computing the total reflection and transmission amplitudes via @xmath28 note that the reflection coefficients for left or right incidence on an inhomogeneous setup usually do not coincide , i.e.  @xmath29 , but the transmission amplitude @xmath30 is independent of the direction of propagation .",
    "more details on the properties of these generalised transfer matrices are given in  [ sec:_trafomatrizen ] .",
    "for equally spaced , thin polarizable slices we set @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 and   simplifies to @xmath34 , with @xmath35 . in an earlier work  @xcite we showed that choosing a uniform distance @xmath36 between the slices and setting the coupling parameter @xmath37 leads to the same optical fields as found inside a medium with refractive index @xmath38 .",
    "a sufficiently dense array of beam splitters with spacing @xmath39 is then in the limit @xmath40 indistinguishable from a homogeneous medium of refractive index @xmath38 and length @xmath41 .",
    "a decisive step in this work , which allows us to account for local material density variations , is the introduction of a local _ displacement _ variable @xmath42 @xmath43 as illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig:_schem_illustration_of_deformation ] , such shifts alter the local fields as well as the total reflection and transmission properties of the object .    .",

    "let us assume a beam entering from the left and @xmath239 .",
    "then the intensity is not only constant on the right of the object , but fresnel s formulae also tell us ( for a homogeneous object ) @xmath240 ^ 2 + 2{\\mathrm{im}}[n]^2 ) \\leq 0,\\ ] ] and hence the intensity has a local maximum at the edge where the beam exits the slab . for the usually dominant gradient force @xmath241 we thus find @xmath242 and @xmath243 left of the surface .",
    "considering the steady state equation   and omitting the scattering force shows that @xmath244 and hence the strain @xmath51 has a local minimum at the right edge @xmath245 . if light enters only from the right hand side we find analogous behaviour for the left edge @xmath188 . since minimal",
    "strain corresponds to a maximum in local material density  , we conclude that the gradient force tends to accumulate material at the surface where a single light beam exits the object .",
    "a similar statement holds for the aforementioned case with two counterpropagating beams oscillating in orthogonal polarisations , but then one has to add up the forces generated by the two beams .    in total",

    "so in total we find both negative ( compressive ) and positive ( expanding ) deformation , depending on the length and refractive index of the object .",
    "for @xmath239 we see a positive strain at the left edge and a minimum with @xmath248 at the right boundary .",

    "there exist numerous experimental and theoretical papers reporting optical stretching of deformable objects , such as biological cells  @xcite , or light induced outward bending of liquid - gas surfaces  @xcite . in the mentioned publications ,",
    "the light - induced deformation is estimated by considering an effective photon momentum change at the transition from one medium to another . in this context , the optical forces emerge as surface forces , acting on the interface between two regions of different refractive index .",
    "since the considered materials are incompressible , the refractive index in each region remains constant .",
    "let us try here a similar approach to estimate the deformation of an elastic object and put our results in context with these earlier works .",
    "but note that the very different physical properties of a linear elastic medium as compared to incompressible water , plane waves instead of gaussian beams and a wave description instead of geometric optics , do not allow a straightforward comparison of the results .",

    "for the values used in the previous examples @xmath285 , @xmath286 , @xmath287 , we obtain @xmath288 when using minkowski s momentum and @xmath289 for abraham .",

    "this allows to formulate a generic wave optics extension for the deformation estimated above in the scope of geometric optics , now including also size dependent reflection and transmission .",
    "the total deformation pressure on an object with length @xmath41 and homogeneous refractive index @xmath295 surrounded by vacuum then reads @xmath296 where the amplitudes inside the medium are computed using fresnel s relations @xmath297 , @xmath298 , the amplitudes outside are connected by the homogeneous reflection and transmission coefficients  , @xmath299 , @xmath300 , and the incoming @xmath301 and @xmath302 are given in  .",

    "the resulting relative length change @xmath284 is presented in figure  [ fig:_def_photon_momentum ] .",

    "chapter  [ sec:_fallenposition ] or figure  [ fig:_trap_stiffness ] . using minkowski s @xmath309",
    "we then find that the force due to photon momentum transfer vanishes at each surface and hence @xmath310 in figure  [ fig:_def_photon_momentum ] .",
    "but from the examples in figure  [ fig:_bsp_rb0_int1 ] we deduce that the intensity at the _ surface _",
    "is zero , yet the object will contract due to the intensity maximum at its central position .",
    "this is because the dipole force pulls each volume element towards the next local maximum of intensity , regardless of whether this volume element is located at the surface or in the bulk of the medium .",
    "in fact , none of our calculations or simulations showed any distinctive effects suggesting a surface force at the boundaries of a dielectric  @xcite .",
    "this is supported by computations on large but finite stacks of polarizable slices where the forces on the first or last slice qualitatively do not differ from those on the second or next to last , respectively .",
    "we therefore conclude that optical forces have to be treated as real volumetric forces  @xcite and that a description using the change of photon momentum at the surface of a medium is inappropriate , regardless of using abraham s or minkowski s momentum .",
    "using an implicit calculation of optical fields and forces allows to self - consistently determine the stationary local deformations of an elastic object , where the local stress balances the local light forces by elastic back action .",
    "these solutions show a surprisingly variable and nonlinear dependence on the chosen parameters .",
    "generally we see a length and illumination dependent , spatially quasiperiodic strain pattern , which can lead to length stretching as well as compression .",
    "as expected , standing wave configurations yield the strongest forces and effective length changes with a clear resonant structure for special ratios of initial object length @xmath41 and trap beam wavelength @xmath257 . in the standing wave setup , variations in the trap wavelength @xmath257 lead to discrete jumps of the stable trapping positions . at @xmath211)$ ] , @xmath212 , the particle switches from a position centred around an intensity maximum to one around a field node , which is associated with changes from compression to elongation of the object .",
    "interestingly , in particular close to these instability points , this generally leads to an increase in trap stiffness .",
    "we expect that this indicates possible bistability between high and low field seeking behaviour for certain lengths very close to @xmath211)$ ] .",
    "although the calculations presented here were performed in the scope of elastic media , we believe that the model can be extended to deformable but incompressible media like water or even dilute gases . here in particular stability thresholds for",
    "the homogeneous solutions should prove physically very interesting , as they could lead to stationary flows , periodic density oscillations or light induced density pattern formation and particle ordering in a gas .",
    "here we limited our considerations to the case , where a steady state solution can be found .",
    "as for other nonlinear dynamical effects  @xcite , there are of course regions in parameter space , were no stationary solutions exist and we find self sustained oscillations or even disintegration of the material .",
    "indications of this behaviour appear e.g.  in a non converging iteration procedure . at this point",
    "we leave this to future work .",
    "we thankfully acknowledge support via erc advanced grant ( catchit , 247024 ) and the austrian science fund fwf grant s4013 .",
    "in equation   we already used the concept of a transfer matrix to couple the plane wave amplitudes left and right of a beam splitter . let us generally define the set of transfer matrices as @xmath311 one can easily show that @xmath312 for all @xmath313 and @xmath314 here denoting the usually omitted matrix multiplication . since also @xmath315^{-1}=\\frac{1}{t } \\pmatrix {              1        &    r_1              \\cr              - r_2    &    t^2 - r_1 r_2    }       \\in \\mathcal{t}\\ ] ] we conclude that @xmath316 is a group .    to motivate definition  , let us consider two plane waves @xmath317 , @xmath98 , and @xmath318 , @xmath100 , left and right of a dielectric with a homogeneous refractive index @xmath38 .",
